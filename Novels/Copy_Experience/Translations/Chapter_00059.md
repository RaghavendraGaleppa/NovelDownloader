# Chapter 59: Divine Sense

Array masters, alchemists, and talisman masters are quite different.

A first-tier talisman master cannot wait until they've learned everything related to first-tier talismans before attempting to advance. It's like the schools in Lu Xu's previous life; junior high students didn't need a perfect score on the high school entrance exam to get into high school, just to exceed the cutoff. Therefore, even some high-grade first-tier talisman masters might not have perfected their experience with low-grade first-tier talismans. The same applies to alchemists. However, array masters must follow a different path: they must accumulate experience in a certain stage to near perfection before they can advance to the next stage. This is determined by the unique characteristics of array masters. Different fields have different methods of advancement.

"But this Master Zong's experience level is truly impressive!" Lu Xu exclaimed, coming back to his senses. An experience level of 88 meant that Master Zong already had the potential to become a second-tier array master. This was extraordinary; looking across the entire Eastern Barren, there were only three or four second-tier array masters. As for third-tier array masters, they had never been heard of; perhaps such an existence didn't currently exist in the Eastern Barren. The existing third-tier grand arrays had all been accumulated over thousands or even tens of thousands of years of long history. A third-tier array master was rarely seen in a millennium, and those who could become one were usually Core Formation cultivators who had given up on further cultivation advancement! The path of arrays was vast, complex, profound, and intricate. Ordinary people simply did not have the lifespan to research arrays to the third tier. Only Core Formation cultivators, with their five hundred years of lifespan, could slowly research and achieve such a feat.

"Array experience is exactly what I urgently need. If I want to scheme for a Foundation Establishment Pill, array formations are an indispensable means!" Lu Xu thought, greatly satisfied. "Coming to this auction today was the right decision!"

He looked towards the high platform, where Master Zong had briefly introduced the array's function, after which the bidding commenced.

The starting bid for the high-grade first-tier grand array was 1,200 spirit stones. Those capable of participating in such a scramble were basically sect and clan forces. After a fierce struggle, this set of arrays was finally taken by a Great Perfection Qi Condensation cultivator for a price of 2,500 spirit stones.

"That's the head of the Long family from Mingjiang, he really invested heavily!"
"It's worth it. With this array, they can guard the Long family's high-grade first-tier spirit vein. From now on, their family foundation is truly established!"
"The Long family, it wasn't easy. They've struggled for five generations, and finally, they've become a cultivation family with a foundation. From now on, as long as it's not a Foundation Establishment cultivator, they won't fear anyone!"

Lu Xu heard conversations coming from behind him. Cultivation families were mostly established through the struggles of generations. Even someone like Old Man Xu, his descendants might not be without hope of establishing a cultivation family in the future. "I wonder how Old Man Xu is doing now, and Er Lengzi!" Lu Xu couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

A moment later, the auction ended, and Lu Xu followed the crowd out of the venue. He immediately went to a shop and purchased the auxiliary ingredients needed to refine Soul Condensing Pills.

Two days later, in front of the Earth Fire Chamber, Lu Xu carefully recalled the techniques for refining Soul Condensing Pills before entering the room. The pill furnace activated, and he methodically monitored the heat, placing spiritual herbs into the furnace one by one.

Nine days later, the glowing red pill furnace opened. Lu Xu waved his hand, and six pills transformed into streams of light, flying towards him.

"Six pills from one batch, not bad. Let's see how much these pills can enhance my spirit!"

Lu Xu put away the Soul Condensing Pills. After recuperating for two days, he began to consume them.

After taking one pill, he felt a refreshing coolness in his head, and a sensation of extreme mental invigoration. After the second pill, Lu Xu immediately felt his perception of his surroundings greatly enhance. It was like a dusty mirror had been wiped clean, as if the entire world had become much clearer. The third pill…

After consuming the fifth pill, Lu Xu felt his forehead swell, and his temples throb with pain, as if something was about to burst out from within. Gritting his teeth, he consumed the sixth Soul Condensing Pill.

*Boom!*

This one pill immediately triggered a qualitative change. Lu Xu instantly felt a roar resound in his mind. Then, as if a layer of restraint had been broken through, his consciousness surged out of the body that had always confined it. His consciousness expanded outwards, and everything in all directions was clearly laid out before him, allowing him to perceive the slightest detail, with nothing able to escape his notice.

"This is Divine Sense?"

Lu Xu was greatly shocked. Wasn't this outward expansion of consciousness exactly what Foundation Establishment cultivators could achieve after cultivating Divine Sense, as recorded in the ancient texts?

"I actually manifested Divine Sense ahead of time!"

For a moment, he found it hard to believe. He had never heard of a Qi Condensation cultivator manifesting Divine Sense.

"Is it because I'm a transmigrator, inherently blessed with a powerful spirit?"

"This is too bizarre. With Divine Sense, won't I be able to fight like a Foundation Establishment cultivator from now on?"

After the initial shock gradually faded, Lu Xu was overjoyed. Manifesting Divine Sense early was simply too great an advantage. Not only would the difficulty of Foundation Establishment be significantly reduced, but everything he did in the future would also be much more convenient. Furthermore, he would no longer be like other Qi Condensation cultivators, only able to control one magical artifact. With Divine Sense, he could completely control multiple magical artifacts in combat, which was a huge advantage in battles.

"I never expected this Soul Condensing Pill to bring me such an unexpected surprise; I only intended to strengthen my spirit initially!"

Amidst his emotions, Lu Xu quickly tested how far his Divine Sense could extend.

"One *zhang*, two *zhang*... ten *zhang*... Is this the limit?"

His Divine Sense spread to a distance of ten *zhang* before it could no longer extend further.

"Ten *zhang* is completely sufficient. This will be an absolute secret trump card that I possess. From now on, I won't have to fear anyone in the Qi Condensation stage!"

"With Divine Sense, going to the Myriad Demon Mountain Range will also be much safer. Perhaps I should consider scouting the mountain range first!"

After pondering for a moment, Lu Xu immediately changed his appearance and went to the commercial street in Myriad Immortals City to purchase various materials needed for setting up array formations. He planned to try creating array formations. Once the arrays were ready, he would go to the Myriad Demon Mountain Range to hunt demons. This would be a test. If this method proved feasible, Lu Xu would likely rely on it to obtain Foundation Establishment Pills.
