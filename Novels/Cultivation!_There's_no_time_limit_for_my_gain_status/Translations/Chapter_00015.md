# Chapter 15: Selecting Cultivation Techniques  

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*  

The deep tolling of a bell rang out—the same signal as when they had departed, indicating they had arrived at their destination.  

The slight forward tilt of their bodies made it clear the flying vessel was slowing down. Soon, the corridor outside grew noisy with chatter. After all, they were still just children, brimming with excitement for new sights and experiences.  

Only when the flying vessel descended to a certain altitude did the previously locked cabin doors finally open. The newly recruited disciples swarmed onto the deck, gasping in awe.  

It had to be said—the scenery of this world was far more magnificent than that of Earth in their past lives.  

The wind remained strong as they faced the enormous canyon ahead, bathed in golden light. A wordless sense of awe struck the hearts of all the disciples.  

That was the Scripture Valley.  

The flying vessel slowly landed on a flat platform at the dock. With a slight tremor, their journey to seek immortality officially came to an end.  

"All outer sect disciples, come receive your disciple robes and tokens!"  

"Two sets of robes per person, same size. If you lose or damage them, you'll have to purchase replacements yourselves."  

Unlike the ethereal white robes of the inner sect disciples, the outer sect uniforms leaned toward practicality. The inner layer was a fitted gray garment, while the outer layer was a dark blue robe—durable and resistant to dirt.  

Jiang Li ran his fingers over the fabric. Smooth and resilient, it was clearly several grades above the finest clothing worn by nobles in the mortal world.  

Even the most insignificant items from the cultivation world would be considered rare treasures among mortals.  

"Our Scripture Valley was established in the year 2134 of the Nine Provinces Calendar, making it 255 years old. Of our eleven founding ancestors, seven still remain to this day, continuing to protect the sect..."  

After collecting their items, the group followed Elder Weng Sanqi as he slowly recounted the history of Scripture Valley.  

Two hundred and fifty-five years—enough time for multiple dynasties to rise and fall in the mortal world.  

But in the cultivation world, this was considered rather brief. More than half of Scripture Valley's founders were still alive.  

The entrance to Scripture Valley lay at the mouth of the golden rocky canyon.  

From the outside, it appeared desolate and rugged. But as they crossed a certain threshold under Elder Weng Sanqi's guidance, it was as if they had stepped through a veil of mist. The world before them suddenly opened up.  

The space inside the valley was vast—at least ten times larger than what could be seen from outside—and far from barren. Flowers, grass, fish, and insects thrived here, with houses and buildings scattered throughout.  

"This is the outer sect area. You will spend a long time living and cultivating here. If you wish to truly join the inner sect, you must work hard in your training."  

---  

"This is Elder Lu, your overseer for all matters in the outer sect."  

"Greetings, Elder Lu!"  

The disciples bowed to Elder Lu, who merely nodded in response without a word. His stern expression made it clear he wasn't the most approachable person.  

"Next, follow Elder Lu to your assigned rooms. Change into your outer sect robes and return here within two quarters of an hour. Remember—I won't wait longer than that!"  

With that, Elder Lu turned and strode off without another word. Despite his hunched posture, his speed was anything but slow. The disciples had to jog just to keep up.  

"Many places in the sect are dangerous. If you don't want to die horribly, don't set foot anywhere unfamiliar!"  

Elder Lu led them to a quiet and sparsely populated residential area. It seemed the new outer sect disciples weren't being housed with the older ones.  

"Rooms numbered 1 through 752 are empty. The keys are in the doors—assign yourselves."  

Once he finished speaking, Elder Lu turned and left as if his task was complete, paying the new disciples no further attention.  

The new disciples quickly scrambled to pick their rooms, hoping to secure the best spots.  

At a glance, the quality of the 700-plus rooms varied greatly.  

The worst were drafty thatched huts tucked into damp, dark corners, crawling with insects and rodents.  

The best, however, were two-story houses with complete furnishings and sizable courtyards.  

Here, the advantage of forming groups became apparent.  

With Qi Tianya—the supreme spiritual root holder—already in the inner sect, Jiang Li's group was now the strongest among the new outer sect disciples.  

With fourteen mid-to-high spiritual root disciples, including Jiang Li and Yan Hong, no one dared to challenge them.  

Even if someone tried, with Jiang Li—an internal martial artist—backing them, what could a bunch of thirteen- and fourteen-year-olds possibly do?  

Without much effort, they secured the best rooms. Even the nineteen lower spiritual root disciples who followed Jiang Li were assigned decent accommodations.  

Not daring to waste time, they quickly changed into their robes. Now, the hundreds of them looked no different from the outer sect disciples they had seen earlier.  

Not wanting to keep the elders waiting, most had returned within twenty minutes.  

The stragglers hurried out of their rooms, still fastening their belts as they rushed to regroup.  

---  

But no matter where or when, there were always those who disregarded punctuality.  

By the time the two-quarter-hour mark arrived, nearly all the disciples had assembled before Elder Weng Sanqi. Yet two boys were still strolling leisurely, chatting and laughing as they approached.  

Only when they noticed everyone staring did they break into a jog, trying to blend into the crowd.  

"It seems some people dislike following rules."  

Elder Weng set down his gourd and casually flicked his sleeve. Two streaks of black light shot out, embedding themselves in the knees of the two boys.  

Screams erupted as they collapsed, clutching their legs in agony.  

"My leg! Aah! My leg is broken!"  

**[Name: Bone-Piercing Nail]**  
**[Type: Magical Artifact]**  
**[Grade: Yellow Tier, Low Grade]**  
**[Note: A concealed weapon that can be poisoned.]**  

Jiang Li cast an appraisal skill and wasn't sure whether to pity them or curse their stupidity.  

For a mortal to be struck by a magical artifact—even the lowest-grade Yellow Tier artifact—meant that leg was as good as ruined.  

"Humph! Everyone, follow me. I don't want this to happen again!"  

No matter how good-natured Elder Weng was, he was still an elder. Even inner sect disciples wouldn't dare disrespect him, let alone two useless outer sect disciples.  

Without another glance at the writhing boys, he led the group deeper into the sect.  

"Next, I will take you to the Scripture Pavilion to select your foundational Qi cultivation techniques. If you don't work hard, this may be your only chance to enter the inner sect. Remember—don't look around, don't speak unnecessarily!"  

On their very first day, they were being taken to the sect's sacred Scripture Pavilion. Jiang Li couldn't help but feel excited.  

After all, he had read countless cultivation novels in his past life. Places like scripture pavilions, treasure vaults, and even garbage dumps—where large quantities of items were stored—always hid something extraordinary.  

*What if I stumble upon Chang'e's private paintings, and she descends from the moon, begging to marry me? How should I refuse gracefully before turning her into a fish?*  

Clearing his throat, Jiang Li composed himself as they arrived before a massive metal door embedded into a cliff face.  

The entire Scripture Pavilion had been carved out of the rock.  

"The first floor contains Qi Refining stage manuals. Ignore the spell and miscellaneous sections—the foundational cultivation techniques are all on the right side."  

"Each shelf is labeled by elemental affinity. You have two quarters of an hour to choose. Once you've decided, report to me for registration."  

"Remember! Only select techniques matching your spiritual roots. There are no second chances!"  

With that, the metal door slowly creaked open. The dim interior lit up with lanterns, illuminating the vast space within.  

"Let's go in."  

Jiang Li and Yan Hong exchanged a glance before stepping inside.  

Following the instructions, they headed to the right-side technique section. Dozens of large bookshelves stood there, easily accommodating the hundreds of disciples.  

Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—the five elemental spiritual roots were the most common, and thus the corresponding techniques dominated nearly 70% of the shelves.  

Yan Hong immediately joined the crowd browsing Water-affinity techniques. Jiang Li, however, pressed forward, searching for manuals suited to dual-element spiritual roots.  

*Fire-Earth, Water-Wood, Metal-Fire, Yin-Water... Yin-Wood dual-element techniques!*  

Finally!  

Jiang Li exhaled in relief—at least he had options.  

Glancing at the shelf, he found only three manuals lying there, looking pitifully sparse compared to the overflowing shelves of five-element techniques.  

**[Coffin Burial Art]**  
**[Ghostwood Art]**  
**[Withered Wood Manual]**  

*...Why do these all sound so... morbid?*  

*I'm a cultured person—can't we get something a little more... alive?*  

With no other choice, Jiang Li picked up the three manuals and skimmed their introductions.  

Due to the pavilion's restrictions, he could only read the summaries—the actual contents were sealed away.  

The descriptions outlined each technique's characteristics, notable past cultivators who had practiced them, and their achievements.  

After careful comparison, Jiang Li noticed that only the **[Withered Wood Manual]** was labeled as an "ancient technique." However, it was also marked as incomplete—only the Qi Refining fragment remained.  

Naturally, Jiang Li couldn't choose a technique that would leave him stranded at Qi Refining. But the word "ancient" intrigued him.  

He had heard that the Five Elements Peak of Mount Shu descended from the ancient Shu Mountain Sect, and that Scripture Valley itself had risen to prominence after discovering an ancient ruin.  

But what exactly was this "ancient era"? Logically, shouldn't the present surpass the past?  

(Note: The text ends abruptly here, but the chapter concludes with Jiang Li pondering the mysteries of ancient cultivation techniques.)
