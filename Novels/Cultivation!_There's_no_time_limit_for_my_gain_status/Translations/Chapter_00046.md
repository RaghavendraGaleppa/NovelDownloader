# Chapter 46: You're an Outer Sect Disciple!?

"This junior brother, it seems this senior brother acted rashly by mistaking you for a water demon and damaging your magic weapon. My sincerest apologies."

"Yin Qiu from the Five Elements Peak of Mount Shu. Junior Brother Jiang Li, could you perhaps get off me first?"

Since continuing like this wasn't productive, Jiang Li felt the flying sword pressing against his neck loosen—clearly a gesture of goodwill from the other party.

Considering they were essentially on the other's turf, Jiang Li naturally wouldn't be foolish enough to press his attack. He immediately released his grip on Yin Qiu's throat, instead wrapping an arm around his shoulder to help him up.

"Junior Brother Jiang Li, you possess remarkable strength. But this attire of yours...?"

Yin Qiu first spent a long moment tenderly inspecting his sword, confirming it hadn't sustained permanent damage, before turning his attention to Jiang Li's tattered clothing.

"Not at all, this meager strength of mine is hardly worth mentioning. Senior Brother's flying sword is truly formidable."

After offering the compliment, Jiang Li looked down at his own exposed state with a helpless expression. While he could withstand the piranhas' bites, his clothes hadn't been so fortunate.

"I accidentally fell into the water earlier and encountered a school of piranhas. Making it out in this state is already good fortune."

This outer sect disciple uniform was the only set he'd brought. Now he had nothing to change into.

But this situation couldn't continue. With no other choice, he formed hand seals to cast Wooden Armor Technique, conjuring a set of lightweight wooden armor to cover himself.

"By the way, Senior Brother Yin Qiu, my sense of direction isn't the best. Could you point me toward where my Hidden Scripture Valley senior brothers and elders are gathered?"

As he spoke, Jiang Li picked up the severed section of iron chain, carefully aligning the broken ends with an expression of deep regret. The sight made the Fire Element Peak disciple's face twitch.

"Follow the riverbank downstream for about ten... Actually, I'd better take you there myself. If my senior brothers or uncles mistake you for an enemy and attack, that would be unfortunate."

Who would have thought Yin Qiu would be so considerate? His thoughtful suggestion made Jiang Li sigh inwardly—warmth could indeed be found everywhere in the cultivation world.

This encounter further reinforced his impression of the harmonious atmosphere among Mount Shu's Five Elements Peaks.

Unlike other major sects, the Five Elements Peaks didn't distinguish between inner and outer disciples. Students directly apprenticed under one of the five peaks to learn their arts.

Perhaps to maintain the purity of their sword hearts, while competition existed between the five peaks, there was remarkably little internal scheming.

As the Hidden Scripture Valley's outer sect teaching elder had once said: "Disciples of Mount Shu's Five Elements Peaks are the easiest to get along with."

"You'll take me there? Will you be flying me there on your sword, Senior Brother Yin Qiu?"

Jiang Li naturally assumed flying swords could enlarge to carry passengers.

"I can't carry others while sword flying yet... We'll take a boat!"

Yin Qiu: (￢_￢) Even if I could carry someone, it would be my cultivation partner—certainly not you.

Following the Five Elements Peak disciple along the riverbank, they soon came upon a narrow boat moored by the shore. Yin Qiu leapt gracefully onto the slender vessel barely wider than a log.

The water beneath rippled slightly, yet the boat didn't rock in the slightest.

Such refined movement techniques... Jiang Li felt a pang of envy at the disparity.

This was the difference between having a master and learning alone—proper disciples had their skill trees carefully cultivated, progressing step by step, while he had to patch together his training haphazardly. Truly a pitiful state.

Though winning the sect competition should grant him inner sect status. Then he could properly apprentice under a capable elder.

"Junior Brother Jiang Li, aren't you coming aboard?"

Noticing Jiang Li's hesitation, Yin Qiu urged him with an amused smile.

"...Here I come!"

Rolling his eyes, Jiang Li jumped three feet high before landing heavily on the boat's stern.

As a body cultivator with considerable muscle mass, plus the dozens of pounds of iron chains around his waist, his landing caused the stern to sink and bow to rise sharply, nearly catapulting Yin Qiu overboard.

"You! You! You!..."

The swordsman barely stabilized the boat, stammering incoherently—proof of a swordsman's remarkable composure.

"Never mind. Hold on tight! Don't blame me if you fall!"

Yin Qiu used his foot to flip up a bamboo pole, which he then used to push off, sending the boat shooting forward like an arrow.

Anticipating mischief, Jiang Li had already secured himself by wrapping his chain around the boat's frame—no amount of speed could dislodge him now.

"Senior Brother Yin Qiu, what are those bamboo poles in the river?"

As they sped along, Jiang Li noticed occasional bamboo poles sticking vertically from the water. Painted black on one end and white on the other, they rose and fell with the current in an irregular but seemingly intentional pattern.

"Yin-Yang Bamboo. They detect underwater yin energy. Didn't your elders explain this?"

Yin Qiu didn't doubt Jiang Li's affiliation—why would an imposter willingly walk into the lion's den?

"Ah, I'm just a lowly outer sect disciple of Hidden Scripture Valley. Who would teach me such things? Look at the shoddy magic tools I use..."

As Jiang Li lamented his circumstances, Yin Qiu suddenly stopped poling and turned to glare at him.

"Outer sect disciple? You're actually an outer sect disciple?!"

He'd been pinned down by an outer sect disciple! A proud disciple of Mount Shu's Five Elements Peak, bested by some nobody from Hidden Scripture Valley's outer sect—how could he show his face after this?

Had he known Jiang Li had only been cultivating for a few months, he might have capsized the boat then and there.

Yin Qiu's back-mounted sword trembled, partially unsheathing before sliding back repeatedly. He desperately wanted to prove himself.

But in the confined space of the small boat, as a ranged fighter, he knew exactly how such a rematch would end—he'd already experienced it firsthand.

"Since when has Hidden Scripture Valley been this strong? An outer sect disciple at your level..."

Though skeptical, one look at that iron chain convinced him—no inner sect disciple would use such crude equipment.

"Here. Consider it compensation for your chain."

His pride as a Five Elements Peak disciple severely wounded, Yin Qiu fumbled for something before tossing a stone at Jiang Li.

[Name: Kun Steel Ore]  
[Type: Mineral]  
[Metal Content: 57%]  
[Formation Process: Slow Dripping]  
[Description: Hard]  
[Primary Element: Kun Steel]  
[Secondary Element: Silicon Dioxide]  

"How could I accept this? I damaged Senior Brother's flying sword too. I really shouldn't..."

Even as he spoke, the ore found its way into Jiang Li's pocket.
