# Chapter 57 - Scripture Transmission Hall  

Jiang Li tossed the already somewhat foul-smelling dead fish into a small river outside the Scripture Storage Valley's outer sect and then sought out Yan Hong in the trading area.  

He asked Yan Hong to send two of his subordinates to the Ascension Pavilion again. Besides purchasing some basic spirit pills and talisman papers not available in the Scripture Storage Valley, they were also to investigate the current status of the albino scaled demon and the location of that scaled demon tribe.  

As for the Spirit Root Seed, Jiang Li had no intention of testing it himself. For now, he could only store the somewhat damaged and shriveled seed in his coffin and set it aside.  

Yan Hong still looked the same—plump and simple—but his business had reportedly been doing well lately. He had gained some reputation in the outer sect and was starting to earn a steady, albeit modest, income of spirit stones.  

After readily agreeing to Jiang Li's request, Yan Hong suddenly pulled him aside and spoke in a hushed, serious tone.  

"Jiang Li, did you and Yu Banxia earn a lot of spirit stones from this mission?"  

"It wasn’t exactly a mission. There were some unexpected circumstances, so it was more of a reward from the sect," Jiang Li replied.  

After all, they had received the spirit stones directly from the Outer Sect Affairs Hall, completely bypassing the mission process. It was purely a reward from the sect. As for whether the mission could even be considered completed by them, that was debatable.  

"Tsk, you guys weren’t careful enough—someone saw you collecting the spirit stones!" Yan Hong’s round face scrunched up in worry.  

"So what if they saw? The Outer Sect Affairs Hall is always crowded. It’s impossible not to be noticed," Jiang Li said dismissively. It wasn’t like some Golden Core elder would come after him for a few hundred spirit stones.  

"You don’t understand. The whole outer sect is buzzing about it. They’re saying you guys got lucky and stumbled upon a windfall—rumors say it’s several thousand spirit stones. Plenty of people are green with envy."  

Hearing this, Jiang Li suddenly recalled that he had indeed overheard similar gossip on his way here, though he hadn’t paid it much attention at the time.  

Now he was shocked. How had such trivial news spread so quickly in just a few hours?  

"Envy? Well, we do have around two thousand spirit stones combined. But what can they do about it? New disciples are protected by the sect for their first year anyway."  

Seeing Jiang Li still unfazed, Yan Hong grew even more anxious.  

"Why aren’t you worried? Today, for some reason, two thousand new disciples suddenly joined the outer sect. Many are saying our batch is now considered senior disciples and won’t receive any special treatment anymore."  

"And even if they don’t dare act openly now, what about after a year? We’ll still be stuck in the outer sect!"  

It was only then that Jiang Li remembered Yan Hong hadn’t yet reached the mid-stage of Qi Refinement.  

For an ordinary upper-grade spiritual root disciple, spending three to five years in the outer sect was the norm. Given that, Yan Hong’s concerns made perfect sense.  

"Oh, I forgot to tell you—I’ve already reached the mid-stage of Qi Refinement. After the outer sect competition in two months, I’ll join the inner sect. After that, I’ll have your back. Problem solved."  

Jiang Li had only revealed his breakthrough during the mission, so Yan Hong hadn’t known until now.  

"Yeah, yeah, you’ll have my back. Just be careful of one guy—he recently reached the late-stage of Qi Refinement and is looking for targets to extort. We’re all... Wait, what did you just say?"  

At first, Yan Hong hadn’t processed Jiang Li’s words, continuing his own train of thought before suddenly realizing what he’d heard.  

"You’re at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement?! Are you the one with the upper-grade spiritual root or am I? I..."  

Even as Jiang Li walked away, Yan Hong remained rooted in place, stunned and questioning his life choices. The threat from that senior outer sect disciple had completely slipped his mind.  

Honestly, Jiang Li hoped this "friend suddenly excelling" shock would motivate Yan Hong to train harder in the future.  

Yan Hong had helped Jiang Li avoid a lot of trouble before, and Jiang Li genuinely wanted him to continue being useful.  

Even as a merchant, Yan Hong didn’t need extraordinary cultivation or strength. But just like how every salesperson in the previous world called themselves a "sales manager," without a certain status, people wouldn’t take you seriously.  

And in the cultivation world, cultivation level was the primary measure of status.  

Take Fu Zhong from the Ascension Pavilion, for example. He handled almost everything at the Great Heavy Mountain branch, managing operations with textbook precision. Yan Hong often praised him as a role model.  

But because Fu Zhong was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, the highest he could ever rise was to the position of steward. No matter how many branch managers came and went, he would never get the top spot.  

At the very least, Yan Hong would need to reach the Core Formation stage in the future—otherwise, he wouldn’t even be a successful merchant.  

As for the threat Yan Hong had mentioned, Jiang Li truly didn’t care. If someone wanted to trouble him, they’d have to catch up to him first.  

What pleased Jiang Li more was that, in the end, Yan Hong hadn’t asked to borrow any spirit stones.  

It wasn’t a big deal, but it spoke volumes about Yan Hong’s character.  

Currently in his growth phase, Yan Hong undoubtedly needed more spirit stones to keep things running. That he could resist the temptation to take a cut was crucial for their future friendship.  

---  

After leaving the trading area, Jiang Li headed straight for the inner sect.  

Presenting the token in his hand, he made his way to the sect’s heavily guarded Scripture Pavilion once more.  

This token was the guidance Elder Weng Sanqi had given him.  

It was said to be related to the foundation of the sect’s establishment—an incredibly rare opportunity.  

Although all inner sect disciples received such a token upon joining, it was a one-time privilege. To obtain another, they would need to accumulate a substantial amount of sect contribution points.  

By choosing to forgo immediate entry into the inner sect in favor of this token, Jiang Li had essentially secured a second chance at this benefit.  

Familiar with the route, Jiang Li soon arrived at the Scripture Pavilion. Elder Li sat at the entrance, leisurely enjoying a jar of wine.  

"Elder Li."  

Jiang Li bowed respectfully.  

"Hmm, same as usual—looking for techniques or spells? Go in and pick for yourself."  

Elder Li’s attitude toward his duties was as laid-back as ever, treating the Scripture Pavilion like a buffet—pay the spirit stones, and help yourself.  

"Elder, I wish to enter the Scripture Transmission Hall!"  

This time, however, Jiang Li had a different goal. He opened his palm, revealing the small token.  

Only then did Elder Li lift his drooping eyelids to examine the token.  

With a wave of his hand, the token flew into Elder Li’s grasp. After carefully inspecting it with a secret technique, he nodded.  

"Correct, this is a Scripture Transmission Hall token. Heh, kid, you’ve got good luck. Outer sect disciples rarely get their hands on these. Follow me."  

Elder Li clearly didn’t remember Jiang Li. After glancing at his outer sect disciple robes, he seemed slightly surprised but said nothing more.  

Leading Jiang Li inside the Scripture Pavilion, Elder Li opened a hidden trapdoor, revealing a stone staircase descending into the ground.  

Under the dim light, they ventured downward.  

As they went deeper, the air grew thick with the scent of ancient history.  

The stone walls of the passage were scarred with sword marks and grooves, as though a great battle had once taken place here.  

Finally, at the end of the passage, the space opened up again. Even in the faint glow of the night pearls, Jiang Li’s sharp eyes could make out a dilapidated hall standing in the vast underground chamber.
