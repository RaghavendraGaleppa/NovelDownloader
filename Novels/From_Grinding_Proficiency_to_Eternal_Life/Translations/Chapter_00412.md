# Chapter 412: Times Change

This method of melting flesh and bone was truly too vicious.

He turned his gaze toward Li Ergou, his eyes gradually turning cold.

Having such a fellow by his side made him feel uneasy.

"Xu, Xu Shixiong..."

Li Ergou搓着手 (rubbing his hands) as he approached, his face still wearing a cowering expression. If not for the blood of Hualing still dripping from his sleeve, one might have thought he was truly timid.

"Shouldn't we..."

His words abruptly stopped.

Just as Li Ergou's voice fell, his cowardly gaze suddenly sharpened. A bloody light exploded from his sleeve, and an extremely sinister green small sword stabbed violently toward Xu Yunfan's back!

Simultaneously, high in the distant sky, the confrontation between the two Foundation Establishment cultivators had reached its peak. The aftermath of the collision between the sword light and the thousand-mile rosy clouds was like a raging stormy sea, shaking the clouds for a thousand miles and making the entire heaven and earth tremble.

However, a thousand miles away, within the crevice of the extreme northern glacial plain...

"Hum!"

A layer of淡 golden light suddenly bloomed around Xu Yunfan. The vast righteous energy of the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture was like the rising sun, majestic and blazing. The moment the sinister small sword touched the golden light, it melted away instantly, like snow meeting boiling water!

Li Ergou's pupils contracted sharply, the feigned cowardice on his face completely freezing.

This strike had been planned for a long time; even an ordinary late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator would find it hard to guard against. Yet Xu Yunfan didn't even turn his head, resolving it solely with his protective true energy!

"Late-stage Qi Condensation... Great Perfection?!"

Li Ergou's voice trembled; he finally realized he had kicked an iron plate.

The person before him had a presence as deep as an abyss and true energy as thick as a sea, clearly the state of half-step Foundation Establishment!

How could such a person be someone he could ambush?

He couldn't help but curse Xu Yunfan inwardly for being inhuman, utterly shameless.

明明自己实力臻至练气大圆满，甚至只消将前置筑基准备好，只差一步就能踏出，托举道基，成就筑基真人的存在。
(明明自己实力已经到了 Qi Condensation Great Perfection, even just needing to prepare the preliminary Foundation Establishment, only one step away from stepping out, holding up the Dao Foundation, and achieving the existence of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.)

没想到还搁这儿演扮猪吃虎？
(Never expected he would still be here acting the part of "a pig to eat the tiger"?)

元始宗什么时候形成的风气?!
(When did the Primordial Sect form such a trend?!)

"You are not bad. If you hadn't encountered me, you might have lived a long life."

Xu Yunfan's dragon scale armor had unknowingly covered his right arm. His five fingers gripped Li Ergou's天灵盖 (Heavenly Spirit Cover) and slowly lifted him up.

The Martial Dao Heavenly Eye revealed that within this person's flesh and Dantian, a few wisps of brilliance were faintly glowing, carrying a sharp aura.

Xu Yunfan understood. No wonder Zhao Ti risked leaving the范围 (range) of the Primordial Sect, chasing all the way here.

He was indeed tracking something.

There was a great secret on this Li Ergou.

"The thing Zhao Ti is looking for."

Xu Yunfan's voice was colder than the Arctic ice. "Hand it over."

Li Ergou kicked his legs wildly and suddenly tore open his clothes, revealing a blood seal on his chest that displayed the mark of the Weichen Peak of the Primordial Sect: "You wouldn't dare kill me! I am—"

Crack!

The sound of a neck snapping rang out simultaneously with the剑鸣 (sword cry) from the horizon.

Using True Martial Subduing Demon true energy to completely dissolve Li Ergou's flesh and blood, Xu Yunfan then tossed the corpse into the ice abyss and摸出 (pulled out) a piece of bone tablet from his怀中 (chest) that was neither gold nor jade.

"Jade Gold亘..."

Xu Yunfan rubbed it carefully for a long time. Yu Congling in his mind suddenly spoke up.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed slightly: "Do you know what this is?"

"Top-tier refining material. If refined properly, it could definitely be used to forge a top-grade magical treasure."

Magical Treasure!?

Xu Yunfan's eyes shone brightly.

These past few days, he hadn't just buried his head in苦修 (bitter cultivation). There was a字之差 (one-word difference) between magical artifacts and magical treasures, which was like the difference between clouds and mud.

This thing...

Xu Yunfan suddenly felt it was somewhat烫手 (scorching hot to hold).

I'm afraid quite a few people are盯着 (watching) it. At least that Zhao Ti clearly knew Li Ergou carried a重宝 (heavy treasure) on him.

Although from the clues, it seemed the other party wasn't clear about the specifics, it didn't mean they would give up.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan felt a slight sigh.早知道 (If he had known earlier) Li Ergou carried a重宝, he should have出手 (made a move) to留 (keep) Zhao Ti and the others behind.

Now...

He仔细地 (carefully) looked at the palm-sized Gold Jade亘 in his hand, then casually tossed it back beside Li Ergou's corpse and left without looking back.

The sword light in the north suddenly flared up.

That Qingming真人 seemed to sense something and actually glanced this way.

Xu Yunfan felt as if he were背负芒刺 (bearing thorns on his back). The True Martial Millstone in his spine spun frantically just to抗住 (resist) the weight of this gaze.

At the same time, a龟蛇相盘相 (image of a turtle and snake coiling together) appeared around him, causing his aura to迅速消弭 (rapidly vanish).

That Qingming真人 seemed to have only sensed a person, casually扫了一眼 (swept a glance) and收回 (retracted) it. But even such a gaze still made Xu Yunfan break out in a cold sweat.

He was already at Qi Condensation Great Perfection, yet he couldn't even withstand a single gaze from a Foundation Establishment真人.

"The might of Foundation Establishment is actually to this extent..."

He was secretly惊骇 (terrified).

With just one gaze, his true energy inside his body became滞涩 (stagnant). If he faced it head-on, he probably wouldn't even last one move before being碾压致死 (crushed to death).

Just as he was about to retreat, he suddenly saw the place where the Dragon Slayer Sword was erupting with seven-colored rosy light. A crystal-clear juvenile ice蛟 (flood dragon) was actually forced out by the sword energy!

"Roar!"

The蛟吟 (flood dragon's roar) shattered the ice for a hundred miles.

However, Qingming真人 laughed loudly. With a轻旋 (light swirl) of her sword finger, she pinned the ice蛟 in mid-air.

"You dare?!"

The other Foundation Establishment真人 contained anger in his voice. He raised his hand and swept it, revealing a thousand-mile rosy cloud Dao Foundation, intending to阻拦 (block).

"Merely rosy clouds, yet you dare阻拦 (block) me?"

Qingming真人轻笑 (chuckled) lightly. Her sword finger suddenly pressed down. That青玉飞剑 (azure jade flying sword) instantly bloomed with piercing cold light. As the sword body trembled, it emitted a clear sword cry like a dragon's roar!

"Swoosh!"

The flying sword was like lightning, piercing through the clouds in an instant and贯穿 (piercing) the ice蛟's head. The sword energy exploded,绞碎 (shredding) the entire蛟 body inch by inch, turning it into scattered ice crystals floating in the sky.

"Li Qingling, you are seeking death!"

The other Foundation Establishment真人 roared. His sleeves鼓荡 (billowed) violently. A赤红血刀 (crimson blood saber) flew out from his palm. The刀 body was缠绕 (entangled) with森森魔气 (dense demonic energy). Wherever it passed, the air was corroded,滋滋作响 (sizzling).

"Blood Demon Saber? You fellow, you have indeed fallen into the demonic path."

Qingming真人 raised her eyebrows but showed no panic whatsoever.

She formed a seal with both hands, and suddenly nine azure sword shadows浮现在 (appeared) around her. Each one was as solid as substance. Wherever the sword锋 pointed, it exuded unparalleled sharpness.

"Nine Azure Swords, go!"

The nine sword shadows interwove and slashed out like游龙 (wandering dragons), colliding轰然 (booming) with the blood saber!

Boom!

Blinding spiritual light flashed. A violent gust of wind swept through a hundred miles. The ground was plowed by the aftermath into dozens of deep沟壑 (gullies) that couldn't be seen to the bottom.

When the smoke and dust散去 (cleared), the blood saber had already broken into several sections, its demonic energy completely散尽 (dissipated).

And Qingming真人's nine sword shadows still悬浮半空 (hovered in mid-air), their sword锋 pointing directly at the opponent's throat!

"You..."

That Foundation Establishment真人's face turned deathly pale. A trace of blood溢出 (overflowed) from the corner of his mouth, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"Thanks for the concession."

Qingming真人淡然 (calmly)收剑 (retracted her sword). The nine sword shadows instantly归一 (merged into one), turning into an azure jade flying sword that没入 (plunged) into her sleeve.

It wasn't that she didn't want to kill the opponent. But although the opponent's strength wasn't as strong as hers, if they wanted to leave, she couldn't留住 (keep) them. Unless the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect sent another Foundation Establishment真人 to赶來 (rush over), otherwise...

She轻吐了口气 (let out a light breath). This trip was a私事 (private matter), so naturally she couldn't let a third party know.

Her fingers moved slightly. The sword energy flowing from her fingertips turned into丝 (threads) and woven into a cage. Every举手投足 (movement) displayed the Foundation Establishment might of "Using the Sword to Control the Heaven".

Even more惊人 (astonishing) was that she actually甩出 (flung out) three sword seals from her sleeve, turning into gold, silver, and purple虹光 (rainbow lights) that没入 (plunged) into the dying蛟 body.
