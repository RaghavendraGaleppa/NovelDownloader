# Chapter 192: The Great Demon Beast

Xu Chuan didn't take the corpse of the Spirit Monkey King, only accepting two corpses of early Foundation Establishment stage spirit monkeys at Li Shiming's insistence. He would have been too embarrassed to take even these if not for Li Shiming's insistence.

Spirit beast corpses had many uses. Their fur could be made into armor—given the defensive capabilities of Foundation Establishment stage spirit monkeys, the resulting armor would at least be mid-grade defensive spiritual artifacts.

It might seem like Li Shiming and Xu Chuan both wielded top-tier spiritual artifacts, but such artifacts were actually quite rare. Xu Chuan, as a true disciple of the Shu Mountain Sect with an elder as his master, naturally had access to high-quality artifacts. Li Shiming's artifacts were obtained from the descendants of a Golden Core cultivator from the Clear Heart Sect, also crafted by a Golden Core elder.

For ordinary sect disciples, merely possessing a spiritual artifact was an achievement—mid-grade defensive artifacts were highly sought after and valuable.

The most valuable parts of the spirit monkeys weren't their fur but their claws. These claws could be crafted into excellent offensive spiritual artifacts without any additional materials. In the hands of a skilled artisan, they could even become top-tier artifacts.

Without further ado, they set off again after dividing the spoils.

After several days of travel, they ventured deep into the spirit beast territory of the Hundred Thousand Mountains. Their pace slowed considerably.

"We need to detour around that mountain ahead," Xu Chuan said after consulting his jade slip. After a brief hesitation, he took out a blank jade slip, copied the information from his own, and handed it to Li Shiming.

"Brother Li, memorize this information as best you can. It must not be leaked. The sect paid a heavy price for this intel," Xu Chuan whispered.

Li Shiming placed the jade slip against his forehead, absorbing the flood of information into his mind, which IBMz15 promptly recorded.

"Give me three days. I'll destroy it afterward," Li Shiming solemnly promised after reviewing the contents.

The jade slip contained detailed information about the Hundred Thousand Mountains, including the locations of spirit veins, details about rogue cultivators, and the precise locations of the Dark Forest Sect's outposts. Even the spirit beast territories had extensive notes, such as the possible locations of Golden Core demon beasts.

Li Shiming also saw the defensive line separating the Hundred Thousand Mountains from the outside world—a stretch of tens of thousands of miles, segmented by arrays to form a continuous barrier. No wonder the Dark Forest Sect, despite nearly unifying the Hundred Thousand Mountains, still lacked manpower. Defending such an extensive border would require an enormous number of cultivators.

He understood that the information in the jade slip likely came from insiders within the Dark Forest Sect. He just didn't know how they had bypassed the Heavenly Demon's mind interrogation.

Xu Chuan had given him the jade slip so that if anything happened to him, Li Shiming could still make his way to the Shu Mountain Sect alone. Without this knowledge, Li Shiming might not even escape the spirit beast territory alive.

Despite their seemingly safe journey so far, Xu Chuan had led them through numerous detours to avoid highly dangerous areas. The jade slip was timely—it would be invaluable for Li Yuanba, who was following behind, ensuring he didn't blunder into a Golden Core demon beast's territory.

"Brother Li, the information here isn't entirely accurate. Use it as a reference only, especially in our current location. Who knows if new great demon beasts have emerged in the past few decades?" Xu Chuan cautioned.

Li Shiming nodded, and the two detoured around the mountain ahead.

"Strange, this lake isn't on the map," Xu Chuan muttered when they returned to their original route.

Their planned path was supposed to be relatively safe, so even after detours, they always returned to it. But now, an unexpected lake lay before them.

As Foundation Establishment cultivators, flying over the lake wasn't an issue, but its sudden appearance was troubling. Many spirit beasts inhabited watery areas, and they had deliberately avoided such regions.

"Should we go around?" Li Shiming asked.

"Neither side is safe," Xu Chuan replied with a bitter smile.

Consulting the map, Li Shiming saw danger warnings on both sides. It seemed this area was home to many great demon beasts.

"Let's proceed carefully," Xu Chuan said after weighing the risks of backtracking versus forging ahead.

Li Shiming didn't object. He sensed no immediate danger.

The two flew over the vast, eerily quiet lake using sword遁. The silence only heightened their unease.

"Something's off. If we encounter a great demon beast, I'll lure it away. Meet me at the destination," Xu Chuan said through gritted teeth.

Li Shiming saw determination in his eyes.

"Don't worry, I'm not suicidal. I have ways to survive," Xu Chuan added with a smile.

Just then, they both froze, sensing an overwhelming presence.

A Golden Core demon beast. Li Shiming wondered if Xu Chuan had jinxed them—no sooner had he spoken than they encountered one.

Xu Chuan's aura surged, eclipsing Li Shiming's entirely.

The lake waters churned as a serpentine figure emerged. Li Shiming's blood ran cold—it wasn't a snake but a dragon, or at least something very close to one.

"Stay safe, Brother Li. Damn it, a four-clawed flood dragon!" Xu Chuan's voice echoed in his mind.

Li Shiming now noticed the creature's undivided horns, snake-like tail, and four-toed claws. Though not a true dragon, this flood dragon was undoubtedly among the most powerful of Golden Core demon beasts.

Xu Chuan lived up to his reputation. Despite the dire situation, he flared his aura to draw the flood dragon's attention and sped away. Li Shiming glimpsed a radiant talisman in his hand, though it remained unactivated.

The flood dragon let out a deafening roar that nearly disrupted Li Shiming's sword遁. The beast ignored him entirely, fixated on Xu Chuan's挑衅 display.

As the flood dragon took to the air in pursuit, Xu Chuan activated his talisman, vanishing at an astonishing speed. The flood dragon twisted through the air, disappearing in hot pursuit.

This was Li Shiming's first true taste of the Hundred Thousand Mountains' terror. Before encountering Golden Core demon beasts, even late Foundation Establishment spirit beasts hadn't fazed him—he could always escape if needed. With his many tricks, worst-case scenarios could be resolved with Nezha buying time for him to use a talisman treasure.

But facing a Golden Core demon beast, he felt utterly powerless. The flood dragon's aura was more terrifying than any Golden Core cultivator he'd met.

Taking a deep breath, he channeled his golden lightning spiritual power and activated Thunder遁, transforming into a streak of golden lightning that flashed toward the opposite shore.

Near the lakeshore, he halted the technique. In mere moments, he'd crossed the lake, but his spiritual power was nearly depleted.

"Five breaths," he murmured. In such environments, Thunder遁 could sustain him for only five breaths. Any longer, and he'd exhaust his spiritual power, leaving him defenseless.

He didn't linger to check on Xu Chuan. A true disciple of a major sect like him undoubtedly had life-saving measures.

Now aware of the flood dragon's presence, he needed to redesign Li Yuanba's route. Though Li Yuanba and his zombie companion could handle any Foundation Establishment spirit beast, Golden Core demon beasts remained an insurmountable threat.

After some time, he charted a new, much longer path for Li Yuanba, weaving around numerous hazards. Safety came first—he wouldn't risk himself or Li Yuanba for Xu Chuan's mission.

Traveling alone had its advantages. His drone, equipped with invisibility and soundproofing arrays, soared into the sky, acting as his eyes to scout ahead without alerting ordinary birds.

This allowed him to move faster, using a telescope to inspect suspicious areas while IBMz15 analyzed the footage. All spirit beasts left traces, regardless of their level.

As dusk fell, they halted. Night travel was inadvisable—many spirit beasts' senses sharpened in darkness, which also concealed their presence. Even with infrared drones, Li Shiming preferred not to move at night. Infrared couldn't distinguish between ordinary beasts and spirit beasts, making constant evasion impractical.

In a recess, he summoned Nezha. With six arms wielding massive weapons, the zombie swiftly carved out a simple cave. After sealing the entrance with a boulder, Li Shiming set up a basic array with spirit stones to mask his presence—his formation flags were depleted, and his current makeshift array surpassed the low-grade formation disks from his Qi Condensation days.

With preparations complete, he held two spirit stones to replenish his spiritual power before turning his attention to the monkey wine.

Standing barefoot on the ground, he poured the wine into his mouth but didn't swallow. As fury welled within him, the chanting of the *Diamond Sutra* echoed in his ears, and a wrathful Vajra apparition materialized behind him.

The Foundation Establishment chapter of the *Diamond Armor Divine Art* converted spiritual power into Vajra force through Buddhist intent, simultaneously strengthening the entire body in motion and stillness.

Swallowing the wine, a scorching energy surged through him. His Vajra force, amplified by the wrathful Vajra's manifestation, violently coursed through his body.

Previously, he'd felt his body couldn't keep up with the Vajra force's demands, leaving a hollow sensation. But now, his body swelled with power, voraciously absorbing the wine's energy to solidify this膨胀感.

An involuntary roar escaped him as the Vajra apparition grew more lifelike. The refined Vajra force intensified its stimulation, and his body devoured the wine's energy to compensate.

He felt like the wrathful Vajra itself—muscles bulging, strength enough to lift the heavens.

Unconsciously, he completed the final stance. The wine's energy was fully absorbed, and the Vajra apparition faded.

Opening his eyes, clarity returned. His muscles had visibly expanded, brimming with power.

A spiritual scan revealed his robes had disintegrated, exposing his transformed physique—no longer lean but heavily muscled.

"Am I turning into a muscle-bound brute?" he muttered.

In this world, bulging muscles weren't the aesthetic ideal. Most non-body-refining cultivators had a more portly, affluent appearance—considered the standard in cultivation manuals.

Despite the bulk, his constitution had improved significantly. This session had advanced his *Diamond Armor Divine Art* to mid-stage Foundation Establishment初期.
