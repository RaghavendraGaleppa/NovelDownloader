# Chapter 59: The Grand Competition Begins  

Before attending the trading fair, Zhang Yan had over ten thousand spirit stones in his possession.  

But after the fair, he was left with fewer than three thousand—his emergency reserve, not to be touched lightly.  

Though the expenses were staggering, the gains were equally impressive. The Ten-Thousand-Year Bamboo, which could nourish his spiritual roots, was just the beginning. He had also acquired over a dozen magical artifacts and several jade slips.  

The cultivators at the fair were incredibly enthusiastic. As long as they were paid, they would sell anything—even a few shameless female cultivators had secretly slipped him notes.  

Zhang Yan had promptly thrown those notes away without hesitation.  

*Who do you think you're tempting?*  

*I practice the Pure Yang Virgin Technique!*  

*If you’re so bold, try again after I reach Foundation Establishment—then we’ll see what happens.*  

---  

Leaving the trading fair, Zhang Yan, still wearing his bamboo hat, blended into the crowd. By the time he emerged, he had changed his appearance entirely.  

Though they were within the territory of the Ten Thousand Flowers Palace—under the watch of a Nascent Soul elder—caution was never a bad thing.  

With his newly acquired treasures, Zhang Yan couldn’t wait to return to his quarters. The outside world was far too dangerous; only by Zhuge Wan’s side did he feel any semblance of safety.  

The journey back was uneventful, devoid of any unexpected encounters.  

Upon returning to the resting area prepared by the Ten Thousand Flowers Palace, Zhang Yan first reported to Zhuge Wan before retreating to his room.  

Activating the protective formation within the room, he immediately took out the Ten-Thousand-Year Bamboo.  

The bamboo was not long, only about four feet in length, its entire body a vibrant emerald green with faint golden flecks. Despite having been severed, it still pulsed with vitality, as if freshly cut.  

"Spirit Nourishment!"  

Holding the bamboo in a specific posture, Zhang Yan watched as wisps of emerald-green energy streamed from it into his body.  

The moment the energy entered him, his entire body shuddered as if electrified—painful, yet accompanied by an indescribable exhilaration.  

In just a few dozen breaths, the process was complete.  

The once-lustrous bamboo in Zhang Yan’s hand had turned into a withered stalk. A light touch of his ring summoned flames that reduced it to ashes in an instant.  

"That’s it?" Zhang Yan stared at the pile of ashes in disbelief.  

*Spiritual roots…*  

*This was supposed to enhance my spiritual roots!*  

*And it was that simple?*  

So simple that he could hardly believe it.  

"Let me see what’s changed." Sitting cross-legged on a meditation mat, Zhang Yan began circulating his cultivation technique. As his energy flowed, spiritual energy surged toward him in waves.  

This was a sensation he had never experienced before.  

"My spiritual root affinity…"  

Zhang Yan’s eyes widened in shock.  

Spiritual roots were crudely categorized into Inferior, Low, Medium, High, and Supreme grades, with affinity measured against the benchmark of Supreme-grade roots.  

An affinity of 1 or above was considered Inferior—practically useless for cultivation, hence often disregarded in the cultivation world.  

Low-grade roots ranged from 21 to 50.  

Medium-grade spanned 51 to 70.  

High-grade covered 71 to 99.  

Supreme-grade was a perfect 100.  

Supreme-grade roots were also known as Heavenly Spiritual Roots, while High-grade roots above 90 were sometimes distinguished as Earthly Spiritual Roots.  

Zhang Yan had previously possessed Low-grade roots, with his wood affinity being the highest—close to Medium-grade, around the forties.  

But now, after absorbing the Ten-Thousand-Year Bamboo, his affinity had soared past 60, just a step away from High-grade.  

"This…"  

"This is incredible!"  

Though he had known the Spirit Nourishment Technique was powerful, its effects still astonished him.  

"And my Spirit Nourishment Technique has only just reached perfection. If I push it to its limits… or refine it into a divine ability after Foundation Establishment, how much stronger could it become?"  

"Right now, I have a wood-affinity spiritual root, so absorbing the bamboo enhanced it. But what if I didn’t have a wood root? Would it create one for me?"  

The thought sent his heart racing.  

What if he used the Spirit Nourishment Technique to complete his spiritual roots?  

*All five elements—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth?*  

And if he mastered the corresponding elemental techniques, evolving them into divine abilities…  

Wouldn’t that make him the so-called "Ten Thousand Arts Immortal Venerable"?  

Able to wield any divine ability at will?  

The idea alone was exhilarating.  

"Even if it sounds far-fetched… it’s worth trying."  

All he needed were the right spiritual materials.  

Though rare, they could be obtained—as long as he had enough spirit stones.  

As for the techniques?  

No problem.  

Practicing techniques was the least of his worries.  

With his diligence and the *slight* assistance from his Equipment Panel, mastering them was effortless.  

The improvement in his spiritual roots was a game-changer.  

He could already feel his cultivation speed increasing by at least thirty percent.  

If a mere Medium-grade root could achieve this, how terrifyingly fast must those High-grade prodigies cultivate?  

And the Supreme-grade ones?  

Just thinking about it made him envious.  

---  

Over the next few days, Zhang Yan immersed himself in experiencing the changes brought by his enhanced spiritual roots.  

Then, two and a half days later, Zhuge Wan summoned everyone.  

"The Grand Spirit Plant Competition is about to begin. Are you all prepared?"  

As she spoke, her gaze lingered on Zhang Yan.  

Clearly, her greatest expectations rested on him.  

"Ready!"  

Zhang Yan took a deep breath and nodded firmly.  

"Good. Then let’s go!"  

With a wave of her hand, Zhuge Wan summoned her enchanted ribbon. Wrapping the disciples in her magic, she transformed into a streak of light and soared into the sky.  

They weren’t alone.  

Countless other streaks of light—Golden Core elders—streaked across the heavens.  

Foundation Establishment cultivators, meanwhile, could only follow on their flying artifacts.  

The most pitiful were the rogue cultivators—those without flying artifacts or seniors to rely on, or those still at the Qi Refining stage.  

Though they could participate in the competition, they had to run there on foot.  

*Having a backer sure makes life easier.*  

The Spirit Plant Competition was unique—it wasn’t just a test of theory.  

It was a test of farming.  

Yes, the competition among spirit plant cultivators was refreshingly straightforward.  

The Ten Thousand Flowers Palace provided each participant with one acre of spirit farmland and seeds to cultivate.  

Each contestant would select their seeds, plant them, and nurture them.  

After three months, the results would be evaluated based on the rarity and value of the spirit plants grown.  

The rules meant that success hinged on two things: seed selection and cultivation skill.
