# Chapter 31: Qi Refining Third Layer  

In the blink of an eye, the new year arrived.  

Outside, firecrackers crackled, and drums and gongs resounded in celebration. Yet, in a small courtyard in the eastern part of the city, Lin Shan remained oblivious to the festivities, wholly absorbed in his cultivation.  

Three months prior, he had smoothly advanced to the second layer of Qi Refinement, progressing at an astonishing pace. The spiritual energy within his body was now sufficient to unleash over twenty Wind Blade spells. Still, Lin Shan felt it wasn’t enough. He continued day and night, absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth—this kind of plundering cultivation was addictive for anyone.  

Over the past six months, apart from basic necessities, Lin Shan had scarcely left his residence, much to the frustration of Mr. Zhao of the Zhao family.  

Ever since that night when his younger brother—a top-tier expert of the Zhao family—had died in Lin Shan’s courtyard, and the scouts sent to track him reported losing sight of him, Mr. Zhao had been on edge. Despite mobilizing assassins from the Nightingales and dispatching spies throughout the city, Lin Shan seemed to have vanished into thin air, as if he had long since left Zangke.  

As the head of the Zhao family and the chief advisor to the Prefect of Zangke, Mr. Zhao was no fool. He refused to believe the matter was over, especially since the antique golden bell Lin Shan had purchased for three thousand taels of gold still sat in his shop.  

Analyzing Lin Shan’s actions—his audacity in using Elder Jiang’s name to deceive him, his foresight in anticipating an ambush, and his lethal countermeasures that had claimed the life of a first-rate expert—Mr. Zhao dared not underestimate him.  

Though he couldn’t fathom why Lin Shan hadn’t moved the golden bell if he had foreseen the attack, Mr. Zhao was determined to eliminate such a threat while the young man was still vulnerable.  

Yet, after half a year with no progress, Mr. Zhao had no choice but to reluctantly give up.  

Little did he know, Lin Shan was right under his nose, quietly cultivating in the city.  

---  

Another year passed. It had been over a year and a half since Lin Shan left the Lin family of Qinghe County, and he was now nearly eighteen.  

Having immersed himself in cultivation, Lin Shan had lost track of time. But now, he emerged from seclusion—not because he had run out of money (he still possessed over a thousand taels of silver, more than an ordinary person could spend in a lifetime), but because he had hit a bottleneck.  

Two months prior, upon reaching the peak of the third layer of Qi Refinement, he found that no matter how much he cultivated, the spiritual energy in his dantian refused to increase.  

Through experimentation, he eventually discovered an "Xuan Guan" barrier—a spiritual node mentioned in cultivation manuals.  

Only by breaking through this barrier and advancing to the fourth layer of Qi Refinement could he expand his dantian’s capacity and continue progressing.  

This bottleneck was a common hurdle every cultivator faced when transitioning from the early to the middle stages of Qi Refinement.  

For the past month, Lin Shan had devoted himself to breaking through this barrier. Yet, every time he gathered spiritual energy to charge at it, the energy would scatter upon impact, wreaking havoc within his meridians and causing significant internal injuries.  

After several failed attempts, he realized brute force alone wouldn’t suffice. Without medicinal aids to assist in the breakthrough, repeated failures would lead to meridian disorder and qi deviation.  

There was another method, however. He discovered that while the Xuan Guan barrier was thick and stubborn, it could be gradually worn down.  

Having tasted the sweetness of cultivation, Lin Shan couldn’t bear the torment of stagnation.  

So, he spent day and night grinding away at the barrier. After half a month, he came to a disheartening realization: at his current pace, it would take him eight to ten years to break through.  

"If a bottleneck from the early to middle stages of Qi Refinement requires a decade of grinding, what about the later stages? And beyond?"  

Lin Shan wondered how other cultivators managed. Isolated and self-taught, he was stumbling in the dark. At this rate, he had no idea when—or if—he’d ever reach the ninth layer of Qi Refinement.  

"If only I could find a place with denser spiritual energy," he mused. "If it were twice as rich, I could break through in five years. Ten times richer, and I’d need less than a year. Twenty or thirty times..."  

After some thought, Lin Shan concluded that venturing into the wilderness to seek a spiritual spring or leyline would be far more efficient than staying put.  

"Of course, the easiest solution would be a potent pill to aid in breaking through. But where would I find a pill tailored for Qi Refinement?"  

With his enhancement panel, Lin Shan considered whether he could repurpose martial artists’ breakthrough pills. But he wasn’t sure if they’d work for him.  

Now at the peak of the third layer, his spiritual energy had grown exponentially since he first began cultivating. He estimated he could unleash over a hundred Wind Blade spells without issue—enough to carve a bloody path through an entire army if necessary.  

"It’s time to venture out and seek opportunities. But before that, there are two matters to settle."  

Lin Shan leisurely tidied up before pushing open his courtyard gate. A biting winter wind howled outside.

Unbeknownst to him, another new year had arrived.  

A crescent moon hung in the sky, and lanterns adorned every household. Though the streets were quiet at night, few pedestrians were about.  

Dressed in white robes with the Warm Sun Jade Pendant at his waist, Lin Shan strolled leisurely through the streets of this southern frontier city. Passersby couldn’t help but steal glances, wondering which noble family this handsome young master belonged to.  

Meanwhile, the Zhao residence was abuzz with activity.  

Tonight was not only the third day of the new year but also the seventieth birthday of the Zhao family matriarch, Old Madam Zhao.  

The estate was decked in red lanterns and colorful paper cuttings. Even the stone lions at the gate wore floral wreaths.  

"Flower wreaths at a birthday celebration? Are they serious?" Lin Shan muttered as he approached, hands clasped behind his back, eyeing the peculiar decorations.  

His confusion was understandable—customs in this world’s Great Song Dynasty differed from his past life, and regional traditions varied wildly.  

After a moment’s observation, Lin Shan blended into the stream of guests entering the Zhao residence. The gatekeeper, noticing an unfamiliar face, moved to ask for his invitation, but Lin Shan slipped past before he could react.  

Inside, the front courtyard was filled with banquet tables arranged in two squares, leaving a large central space where a theatrical troupe performed on a stage.  

Lin Shan took a seat at a lower table and helped himself to the lavish spread of fruits, wine, and meats. After a year and a half of secluded cultivation, he had no qualms about indulging—after all, Mr. Zhao still owed him three thousand taels of gold.  

The other guests, prominent figures from the southern frontier’s political, military, and business circles, eyed the unfamiliar young man in white with curiosity.  

---  

Half an hour later, as the guests settled in, the performance concluded. Mr. Zhao and his mother, Old Madam Zhao, emerged from the inner courtyard and took their seats.  

"Thank you all for taking time from your busy schedules to attend tonight’s banquet. On behalf of my mother, I raise this toast to you all—may your careers flourish, your martial prowess prosper, and your wealth abound!"  

"To this cup!"  

The crowd echoed his toast, raising their glasses in unison.  

After several rounds of food and drink, Mr. Zhao clapped his hands, and a procession of exotic dancers from the Western Regions took the stage.  

Clad in sheer silks, their movements were mesmerizing. Lin Shan watched, enthralled, marveling at the Zhao family’s connections—to procure so many dancers from afar was no small feat.  

In his previous life with the Lin family, he’d never been privy to such luxuries. Tonight, he feasted both his eyes and his palate.  

Glancing around, he noticed the nobles seemed unfazed, still engrossed in their networking. Clearly, such entertainment was commonplace for them.  

Once the dance concluded, the performers dispersed, each attending to a guest—pouring wine, massaging shoulders, or kneading legs.  

A stunning dancer with captivating eyes and a bare midriff approached Lin Shan. She knelt beside him, her delicate hands gently kneading his legs, her fragrance intoxicating.  

Having gone twelve years in this world without intimacy, Lin Shan found his thoughts wandering...
