# Chapter 11: The Nine-Foot Sword Qi Expert

Jianmen Pass.

One of the eight northern frontier passes.

Nestled among towering mountains, the pass stood between sheer cliffs that pierced the clouds like swords. The steep precipices faced each other like massive gates, hence the name "Sword Gate." Renowned as "the most perilous pass under heaven," the towering fortress made anyone approaching feel insignificant.

After slaying the Earth Walker and driving off Ai Haike, Dou Changsheng had ridden hard to reach Jianmen Pass without further incident. Yet now, with the formidable pass in sight, his vigilance only grew sharper. Throughout history, countless heroes had fallen at the final step of their journey.

The attitude of Jianmen Pass's garrison commander remained unclear—this very man had sparked the current northern conflict. The pass had become the eye of a storm, contested between the Great Jin's Prime Minister, the Northern Pacification General, and the Hu tribes. With his limited strength, Dou Changsheng knew he could easily be crushed in this vortex of power.

After a long pause atop his horse, Dou Changsheng dismounted and led his steed toward the pass. Jianmen had been sealed without warning, its massive gates shut tight, intricate wave-like patterns carved into their surface glowing faintly with flowing energy.

As he approached, armored soldiers appeared atop the walls. A dozen drawn bows aimed at him as a commander resting a hand on his sword hilt called down sternly, "Jianmen Pass is closed! No unauthorized persons may approach. Seek another route if you wish to cross the frontier."

Their gazes lingered on Dou Changsheng's sword—in this world, those who carried blades were martial artists, a privileged class. Commoners would have been met with warning arrows, but warriors demanded more caution.

Dou Changsheng produced a token from his robes and raised it high. "By order of the General's Office—delivering frontier army provisions!"

The commander scrutinized the token's markings before waving his hand. "Open the gate! Admit the General's envoy!"

With a groan, the massive gates parted. The armored commander approached—a steel-clad behemoth weighing nearly a thousand pounds, yet leaving no footprints as he walked, as if his armor weighed nothing. Behind him stood a squad of expressionless soldiers whose collective presence felt singular and overwhelming.

Stopping three paces away, the commander said flatly, "So the General's Office finally sent someone. I'd begun to think no one would come." Without waiting for a reply, he turned and strode back into the pass.

Dou Changsheng frowned. After braving countless dangers on his arduous journey, he found neither welcome nor warmth at Jianmen Pass. The atmosphere here was palpably wrong.

Following the commander inside, Dou Changsheng remained alert. The Northern Pacification General Yu Yun had governed the frontier for over a decade, establishing an administration that controlled military appointments like this commander's. If the General's Office lacked such authority, Yu Yun wouldn't have been imprisoned.

Of course—the unusual tension here explained how a mere garrison commander could consider surrendering the pass. This wasn't one man's rebellion, but the collective discontent of the entire frontier army. The commander merely represented troops pushed beyond endurance.

The timely delivery of provisions, even at the cost of a Pure Yang Grandmaster's vital essence, was a desperate attempt to placate them.

As the gates closed behind him, Dou Changsheng's heart pounded. He feared the commander might suddenly order his capture—in this confined space, escape would be impossible. Yet the worst didn't occur. Though cold, the commander remained composed, leading Dou Changsheng directly to the Colonel's residence.

Jianmen's garrison commander held the rank of Polu Colonel. This military outpost had no civilian administration—all matters fell under the colonel's authority, a temporary wartime measure instituted when the Northern Pacification General was entrusted with frontier defense over a decade ago.

After waiting outside the residence, Dou Changsheng was finally received by a long-bearded scholar who led him to a spartan audience hall. There, an obese figure sat gnawing on a lamb leg, grease smearing his hands and mouth.

"Where is it?" the colonel mumbled around mouthfuls of meat. "They said it's Pure Yang blood. I need to verify—there's a world of difference between ordinary blood and vital essence."

Dou Changsheng unwrapped his bundle and presented it. "After separating from Black Eagle Venerable at Jun County, which of us carried the real item? I cannot say—you must examine it yourself."

The colonel grabbed the package with greasy fingers, indifferent to its contested value. Unwrapping it, he examined the glowing gemstones within. "You're the Wang clan's heir from Xiangzhou," he sneered. "Some say you're their chosen successor. With your status and skills, why would a mere post-celestial warrior like Black Eagle Venerable dare use you as decoy?"

"Tang He's been following you. He arrived first and already reported everything."

The colonel rubbed the stones, their hue shifting to blood-red, radiating heat. "Countless have died for this. Black Eagle, half in the grave already, raced a thousand miles as bait to buy you time to deliver this bribe for the frontier troops' loyalty."

Suddenly, the colonel crushed the stones to dust. "Now they think to placate us? Where were they before? We bleed here fighting Hu invaders while they enjoy the peace we bought with lives! We expected to die—that's a soldier's fate. But they dared touch our families! What's the point of fighting Hu then? Dead is dead, whether by their hands or barbarians'!"

"Yu Yun betrayed us—betrayed all the north! For over a decade, we've given everything—lives, wealth—countless families ruined! While the capital and Liang feasted, not a copper came north to feed us! Why must defending Jin fall solely on us?"

"Yu Yun, an outsider, saw northerners as livestock! He surrendered to imperial decree without fighting for us! And old Master Yuan—fool! Spilling his essence to cover the capital's theft of our pay!"

"If the court abandons the north, why should we stop the Hu? Let those soft southerners feel their blades! Let's see their fine words hold up then!"

"The north has suffered enough. It's not just us—the entire frontier is ready to erupt. Even rabbits bite when cornered. Let's see how those lords handle northern fury!"

After this tirade, the colonel wiped his mouth and grew calm. "You've shown courage coming here. Leave now if you value your life."

Shoved unceremoniously outside, Dou Changsheng stood bewildered. The northern crisis ran deeper than imagined—this wasn't mere treachery, but a region pushed beyond endurance. No wonder even loyalists like Ai Haike wavered. The north was a volcano awaiting its spark.

As he wandered aimlessly, Tang He called him over. Inside a small house, the man sighed. "Black Eagle Venerable's in danger—I mean to rescue him, then leave the north."

"I came here inspired by General Yu's fame, but found war's reality—countless families shattered beneath his glory. He obeyed imperial decree, but betrayed the north that made him great."

"The Hu chieftain's promises tempt many northerners—autonomy, a northern king among Hu royalty. Many believe him, since Hu tribes govern themselves. No wonder the General's Office meets such resistance—they've lost control here."

"The Prime Minister, the General's Office, northerners, Hu tribes—it's chaos. I'll oppose Hu schemes, but won't suppress northerners' justified anger. With Hu strength and northern support, Jin may fall."

"If you need refuge later, seek me in Great Chen."

Dou Changsheng stood. "I'll help rescue Black Eagle Venerable. Such an elder shouldn't die for this conflict."

Tang He smiled. "I knew you'd agree. Against such foes, we'll need your nine-foot sword qi mastery. When I saw you slay the eight-foot burrowing Earth Walker with one stroke, I knew..."

"Wait—nine-foot sword qi? What nonsense! Weren't you watching me?"
