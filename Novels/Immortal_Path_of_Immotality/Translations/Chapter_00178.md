# Chapter 177: This World Is Too Crazy  

"Yo~~~Halt!"

"This road belongs to me, these trees were planted by me."

"If you wish to pass through, leave your toll behind!"

A group of demonic cultivators stared dumbfounded at the Black Lotus Sect's Guardian Dharma King spinning in circles ahead, feeling an overwhelming sense of absurdity.

A mighty late-stage Nascent Soul expert of the Black Lotus Sect had actually gone mad from burning an immense amount of faith power, his mind and spirit utterly disturbed!

Upon reflection, the accumulated faith power from the six regions of the Great Song Dynasty over a thousand years was indeed vast and overwhelming. The Guardian Dharma King was already not at his peak strength, and this body was one he had seized through possession, not his original fleshly form. 

Perhaps it wasn't entirely unexpected that he had lost control?

But Elder, if you're going to lose your mind, why drag us along with you?

Do you need an audience for your performance? 

Or are we just your playmates?

The demonic cultivators were on the verge of tears. The problem was, they were stranded in the middle of nowhere, with righteous cultivators hunting them down. The Yimeng Mountain pass was one of Qingzhou's key transportation routes—if they stayed too long, they'd surely be discovered by the righteous forces.

By then, it might be too late to escape!

Everyone was anxious and trembling with fear, but the Guardian Dharma King paid them no heed.

Anyone who passed by was captured by his immense power and dragged over.

Some demonic cultivators had tried to sneak away, but despite his current madness, the Guardian Dharma King would instantly pull them back if they strayed from his sight.

After several failed attempts—even Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord couldn't escape—everyone's hearts turned cold.

They had fought their way here, only to be trapped by their own demonic elder just as they were about to cross Qingzhou and escape by sea. Now, they were utterly helpless, left to wait for death.

Even if the righteous cultivators arrived, they'd likely meet the same fate, falling into the Guardian Dharma King's hands.

But that would only be temporary.

The righteous sects had over ten Nascent Soul elders combined, not to mention ancient powerhouses like the Grand Elder of the Violet Thunder Sect.

At his peak, the Guardian Dharma King might have been evenly matched with them, but now, weakened from possession and mentally unstable, even a single Nascent Soul elder could easily defeat him.

The hundred or so demonic cultivators were restless, while the Guardian Dharma King was having the time of his life.

---

His role-playing was dizzying—the highwayman was just one of his many personas.

"That damned corrupt official! I beat the drum to appeal for justice, but instead of fairness, I was given forty lashes in the courtroom. Where is the justice in this world?"

The red-robed youth's face shimmered with golden light, vaguely resembling a simple, honest farmer from Jingxiang who had been wronged by corrupt officials and local gentry. In desperation, he had turned to the Black Lotus Sect.

---

"Big Brother, it's time for your medicine. Drink this, cover yourself with blankets, and sweat it out. You'll feel better tomorrow."

"Wuwuwu... Why did you only return now, Brother-in-law? My husband died of heartache days ago, leaving me all alone..."

"Husband, now that Wu the Second has returned and is investigating his brother's death, I went outside the city to seek a Buddha statue, praying day and night for peace."

The red-robed youth's face shimmered again, this time taking on the guise of a seductive, tragic adulteress who had murdered her husband. Fearing her brother-in-law's investigation, she had sought out a wild Buddha statue to worship. From her terrified words, it was clear this wicked woman had met a gruesome end.

---

"I've seen many young men like you, thinking a little martial skill makes you invincible. But wandering the martial world is a painful path—there are many things you cannot do with just martial arts."

"You don’t want to farm, you disdain robbery, and you refuse to perform in the streets. How will you survive?"

"Everyone goes through this phase—seeing a mountain and wondering what lies beyond. But once you cross it, you’ll find nothing special. Looking back, you might prefer the side you left."

This was a man who had experienced life's hardships, having lost love in his youth and wandered the world alone. Now, he seemed to be lecturing a younger man.

---

"Every spring, the peach blossoms in my hometown bloom brilliantly. I wanted to see them once more before I went blind, but I’ve run out of money..."

This was a destitute, wandering blind swordsman who longed for his wife until his dying day, never able to return home.

---

"Heroes rise with the winds of the world; once you enter the martial world, time slips away. If you youngsters don’t train hard now, you’ll suffer later!"

This time, it was a burly man—likely a martial arts instructor for a mortal family—teaching his juniors grappling techniques.

---

"Heaven would be dark without Ma Yuanjue; the path of the sword would be eternal night!"

This was a swordsman from the Southern Border, his arrogance boundless, as if the world's myriad charms paled before the moment his blade was drawn.

---

One by one, men and women, old and young, took the stage, their faces flickering across the red-robed youth's visage. These were the collective consciousness of countless souls, twisting his mind, even beginning to fight like insects in a jar, vying to be reborn in this body!

This wasn’t impossible.

Whether a person remains themselves is a profound question, open to interpretation.

When a foreign memory invades another soul and the two merge, is the resulting soul still the original?

Or is it another person, resurrected in someone else's body with their own memories?

This is why faith power is toxic—not only does it poison the world, it disrupts the cycle of reincarnation and the order of the underworld, throwing the natural laws of life and death into chaos.

Imagine the judges of the underworld, faced with a soul awaiting reincarnation and another in the mortal world with the same memories. How would they decide?

This is why ancient powers of the upper realms strictly regulate faith-based sects—to maintain order and the natural flow of the heavens.

But in this world of immortal cultivation, there are always those who defy fate, creating countless variables. This unpredictability is the wonder and allure of chaos itself.

Now, within the red-robed youth possessed by the Guardian Dharma King, countless streams of memory clashed in a brutal struggle. The strongest memories devoured the weak, growing ever more powerful.

In the end, the victor would take over the Guardian Dharma King’s Nascent Soul, controlling the red-robed youth’s body in a new form of rebirth!

Lin Shan and the others watched in horror, unsure what kind of person would emerge.

Would this newly born powerhouse still identify with the demonic path?

Or would he become an agent of justice, wiping out these "demonic scum"?

Or perhaps discard his past entirely, leaving them behind to roam the world freely?

The uncertainty, the looming danger, the pressure from all sides—it gnawed at the hundred demonic cultivators, fraying their nerves.

---

Two days later, the gathered crowd had swelled to over five hundred.

Half were actually righteous cultivators. Marching triumphantly through the eastern heartland of the Great Song, they had planned to secure and blockade Qingzhou's coastline—only to be snatched by an enormous energy hand as they passed Yimeng Mountain and dumped into the crowd.

When they looked up and saw the surrounding demonic cultivators, tense and red-eyed, they nearly panicked, ready to fight.

But before they could act, they found their dantians and muddle palaces sealed—no spiritual power or divine sense could be used!

Now terrified, the righteous cultivators realized their opponents were similarly powerless. 

Frustrated by the constant attempts to escape, the "Guardian Dharma King" had simply sealed everyone's cultivation.

Without their powers, most dared not flee. Even if they escaped, they'd be reduced to mortals, vulnerable to enemies, wild beasts, or poison—better to wait for rescue.

Besides, escape was impossible.

The red-robed youth was ruthless. Despite his youthful appearance, his power was immense, easily subduing hundreds from both sides—including over a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators. He was clearly at least a Golden Core expert.

Repeated escape attempts might provoke him to kill.

Thus, an unprecedented scene unfolded in the eastern warzone.

Righteous and demonic cultivators stood apart, yet coexisted peacefully—even sharing sympathetic glances after two days.

---

On the third day, everything changed.

Within the red-robed youth, the warring consciousnesses had finally produced three victors, who now took turns controlling the body.

Mornings belonged to a rugged man—a martial arts instructor from a noble family.

Afternoons were for a sixty-year-old scholar, Master Cen, a former tutor.

Evenings were ruled by the flamboyant swordsman, Ma Yuanjue.

These three had emerged from countless souls, absorbing the Guardian Dharma King’s memories to form a new, fractured personality—three faces of one being.

Think of it as... multiple personalities.

---

That morning, the red-robed youth—now "Martial Instructor"—stood tall, surveying the crowd with sharp eyes.

"Heroes rise with the winds of the world; once you enter the martial world, time slips away. If you youngsters don’t train hard now, you’ll suffer later!"

"???"

"???"

"???"

Everyone was stunned. This was the "Martial Instructor" who loved lecturing juniors? 

He had won?

A mortal had actually taken over the body of a late-stage Nascent Soul demonic overlord!

This world was insane!

Now at his mercy, the cultivators listened obediently.

"Form two lines! Twelve in each, one zhang apart. Assume horse stances—training begins now!"

Some hesitated, but those from martial families—like Lin Shan—recognized the drill.

Memories of his early days in the Lin family flooded back. Back then, he had trained diligently, dreaming of becoming a master swordsman—until he discovered his lack of talent for martial arts.

Now, fate had brought him full circle.

"Move it!" the Martial Instructor barked.

Lin Shan snapped out of his daze, joining the lines with his followers. Even the Black Skeleton Demon Lord stood awkwardly among them—did a skeleton really need martial training?

The Martial Instructor paid no heed. To him, teaching was teaching, whether to humans or ghosts.

Satisfied, he demonstrated a set of fist techniques—his own creation, the "Kun Fist."

"Today, I teach you the Kun Fist! Inspired by the legendary Kun fish, it’s a lethal grappling art for self-defense."

"Three moves: 'Great Kun Spreads Its Wings,' 'Cloud-Piercing Strike,' and 'Kun Roams the World.' Watch closely!"

His movements were fluid, powerful, each strike carrying the weight of the mythical Kun fish.

"Did you learn it?"

"YES!" the crowd shouted.

"Good! Training begins now. No pain, no gain!"

As the morning sun rose, the forest echoed with the sounds of martial practice—like a noble clan training its youth.

By noon, another group of righteous cultivators approached from the west—led by a portly Golden Core elder.
