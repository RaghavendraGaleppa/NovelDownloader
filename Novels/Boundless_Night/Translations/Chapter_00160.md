# Chapter 160: A Friendly and Cordial Exchange

“Let him use one hand.” The moment these words were uttered, not just Li Daocheng, but all the other disciples from the Outer Immortal Lands rose from the high platform, unable to remain seated.

Especially on the lapis lazuli paved ground, the green-robed youth stood with one hand behind his back, the other raised, a brilliant smile on his face.

How could Li Daocheng, the main target, tolerate this? No one had ever dared to belittle him so much.

“Elder, please let me enter the arena! I’ve cultivated the 'Immortal Combat Scripture', advancing on both paths simultaneously. I fear no one from any ancestral court!” he pleaded vehemently.

The elder of the Outer Immortal Lands narrowed his eyes, displeased. Those from their path had always been the strong ones, yet today they were being provoked.

“Enough, let's stop here for today,” the elder shook his head, insisting that Li Daocheng not enter the arena.

He felt that Li Daocheng might not necessarily win. If he lost, it would be a complete rout, stripping them of even their last shred of dignity.

Being in the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, he couldn't extend his spiritual consciousness to investigate the green-robed youth's background. After all, an old geezer with only a few hairs left on his head was watching him.

But his instincts were sharp, telling him that this youth was very 'demonic,' likely a trump card of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, specially released this time to completely dismantle a group of challengers.

“What if I fight with my hands behind my back?!” Qin Ming spoke again, his large sleeves fluttering as he placed both hands behind his back.

Many people's gazes changed. Did this mean he would only use his feet?

All the disciples of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court stirred, feeling that this junior brother was truly formidable. They hadn't seen such a powerful 'seed disciple' in many years.

However, they indeed felt refreshed! It had always been the Outer Lands that were dominant, but now, finally, the tables had turned.

The arena was wreathed in clouds and mist, all transformed from fire springs, extraordinarily brilliant, making the green-robed youth appear as if he stood atop the Ninth Heaven.

Qin Ming stood with his hands behind his back, his chin slightly raised.

“He’s so arrogant!” the white-robed maiden Luo Yao exclaimed, even grinding her teeth. She was furious but powerless to act.

Li Daocheng naturally grew even angrier upon hearing such words.

In fact, the group of disciples from the Outer Immortal Lands had already reached their limit. Some top core disciples requested to fight, wanting to use the methods of the Outer Lands.

For so many years, they had always felt psychologically superior, looking down on the Newborn Path, believing it to be the path taken by those who failed to qualify for the Immortal Path.

Yet today, they were being looked down upon!

However, their elder Mu Huaijin became increasingly convinced that the green-robed youth in the arena must have a strong backing, and his current goal was to overturn all Outer Land disciples.

Mu Huaijin scanned them and said, “As disciples of the Immortal Path, how can you be so impetuous? What is this? Merely an insignificant spar, why dwell on it?!”

Then, he calmly continued, “He has no destiny with the Immortal Path; he can only rely on physical mutation to improve himself. It's normal for such individuals to rise quickly and fiercely in the early stages. However, starting from the Outer Saint realm, their speed will slow down, and you will quickly pull away from them. By the third realm, he will only be able to gaze upon your backs from afar.”

Hearing the elder's words, the group of Outer Land disciples felt much better. Their inner agitation was soothed, and they gradually regained their composure.

Mu Huaijin spoke again, “Furthermore, in the later stages, he will be competing with your disciples and grand-disciples, because his advancement speed will become increasingly slow. Hmm, in the next realm, you will be qualified to select such individuals as your personal guards. If you were to fight him fiercely now, exchanging blows back and forth, you would find it to be quite worthless many years from now.”

Of course, he only transmitted these words secretly. Otherwise, some old geezers from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court might directly come over to 'weigh' him.

Instantly, the group of Outer Land disciples felt relieved. Losing to an opponent using the methods of the Newborn Path was merely a fragmented scene on their Immortal Path.

But why was this 'scene' so dazzlingly irritating?

The opponent actually spoke again, infuriating them!

“I, Qi Zizai, stand here now, and I only ask: Do the disciples of the Immortal Lands dare to fight?” Qin Ming challenged.

(He had originally wanted to call himself Wu Zizai, but then thought that 'Wu' sounds like 'five', and it wouldn't be good to rank himself ahead of Lu Zizai. So he used 'Qi', which sounds like 'seven'.)

Qi Zizai was arrogant and domineering, representing the Six Imperial Ancestral Court. What did that have to do with Qin Ming?

“You claim to be the Immortal Path, a brilliant light illuminating the night sky, yet no one dares to step forward?!” Qin Ming spoke again.

The white-robed maiden Luo Yao clenched her fists, Li Daocheng’s purple hair flared, and the other disciples were also seething with rage.

Undoubtedly, the name Qi Zizai was destined to stick with them for a long time. It would be hard for them to forget today's experience.

Mu Huaijin's efforts were in vain. The group of young disciples who had just sat down were all provoked into standing up again.

“Qi Zizai, I'll come...” A core disciple began to speak.

“Sit down!” Mu Huaijin pressed his hand onto the disciple’s shoulder.

Qin Ming sighed. He wanted to provoke Li Daocheng into the arena for a serious spar, to make his emotions fluctuate violently. He greatly coveted that 'Immortal Combat Scripture'.

However, the elder of the Outer Immortal Lands was too cautious. Despite such provocation, the other party refused to engage, exercising considerable restraint.

Seeing Qin Ming's helpless expression, Mu Huaijin himself felt like entering the arena.

“So it's Junior Brother Qi Zizai! Such a young and promising seed-level talent will surely achieve greatness in the future, perhaps even becoming the ancestor of our Six Imperial Ancestral Court's revival!”

The disciples in the Ancestral Court discussed heatedly. Their moods were naturally completely different, all quite exhilarated and excited.

Only Lu Zizai's expression froze slightly; that name was a bit too ostentatious.

Especially when he saw Qin Ming extend his hand again, he felt it was going too far. The mission had already been 'over-fulfilled'; it couldn't continue. He had to call him back immediately.

Because now, Qin Ming slowly extended one hand, then retracted four fingers, pointing a single finger towards the sky. Without even thinking, everyone knew he was about to utter more outrageous words.

“That's enough. You should leave the stage now,” someone transmitted to Qin Ming's ear. Going too far really wasn't good.

Qin Ming had no choice but to slowly retract his index finger, turn around, and drift away, leaving behind a transcendent and unforgettable silhouette for everyone.

Behind him, a group of young disciples from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court loudly chanted his name.

When Qin Ming uttered those arrogant words, he felt no discomfort. What did it matter to be domineering? Because right now, he was merely Qi Zizai.

He thought the spar had concluded, but unexpectedly, not long after, an elder sought him out. There was actually a 'friendly exchange' meeting waiting for him to attend.

Qin Ming was stunned. The matter wasn't over yet?

The elders of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court also hadn't expected it. They had merely arranged it with a smile, and the other party "gladly" agreed.

Mainly, Mu Huaijin and the others wanted a closer look at Qi Zizai. Could it be that a reviving ancestor was truly about to emerge from the decaying Six Imperial Daoist Temple?

Inside the huge palace built of lapis lazuli, it was quite spacious, with thick pillars carved with god-like creatures, possessing a strong sense of antiquity.

On the ebony tea tables, tea fragrance wafted, and the atmosphere was harmonious, with the old folks chatting and laughing.

Qin Ming was surprised. All the Outer Land disciples had arrived, including the silver-armored maiden who had suffered a backlash from the Violet Mansion Thunderflame. Even the injured were present.

Although the three elders from the Outer Lands were smiling, they were not pleased. Each of them had a scruffy old man sitting very close beside them, practically 'clasping arms in friendly conversation'.

The Six Imperial side was preventing them from extending their spiritual consciousness to investigate their own disciples.

Not only Qin Ming, but Zhuo Ya and Cui Chongxuan also came. The Six Imperial side had over a dozen disciples present.

Zhou Shize spoke, “I think it's better to leave this place to the young people. With us here, they won't be able to relax.”

Ultimately, he invited Mu Huaijin and the others to drink tea elsewhere.

Qin Ming's eyes shone brightly, his heart excited.

He surveyed the people opposite him; all of them looked at him with ill intent.

“We've met through a fight, so let's call it acquaintance through conflict. I'll offer tea instead of wine as an apology to everyone.” Qin Ming stood up. After the old men had left, he looked forward to this exchange even more.

Beside him, a group of young disciples from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court greatly admired him. He actually just carried a teacup and, alone, walked into the midst of the opposing group.

“Senior Brother Qi, he truly is a paragon of our generation!” Cui Chongxuan sighed softly, his eyes shining. He had watched several of the matches, and Qi Zizai's dominant sweep of his opponents had truly impressed him.

Among the Outer Immortal Lands, a group of people had been offended before, and some now wished they could fight him to the death.

Some even emitted shimmering light, their armor clanging.

Qin Ming didn't care. In this Six Imperial Ancestral Court, how dared they act so presumptuously?

Moreover, with no elders present, who was truly afraid of whom?

He remained unconcerned, smiling brilliantly as he said, “Everyone, there’s no need to mind the matter of the spars. It has long since vanished from my mind like smoke. Do you wish to carry mountains on your backs? The road ahead is still long. If you wish to approach Immortality, you must possess a heart of great freedom and uninhibitedness.”

Everyone present was taken aback. This arrogant fellow had actually adopted a different demeanor, which made them quite unaccustomed, and what he said indeed made some sense.

Qin Ming raised his cup and said, “Everyone, cultivation is about severing the mountains in your hearts, one after another. You should all let go. What are temporary gains and losses, honor or disgrace, worth?”

The group of disciples from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court was filled with admiration. What was 'bearing'? Qi Zizai was truly as his name suggested: too free and uninhibited.

The expressions of the Outer Immortal Lands' people softened slightly. This arrogant fellow seemed a bit more agreeable than before.

However, they quickly changed their minds.

Qin Ming spoke again, “Everyone, you still need to work hard! I don't wish for you to gaze at my back years from now and find it as distant as mountains and seas!”

Some disciples from the Outer Immortal Lands had been drinking their tea, responding to his "goodwill," but now they wanted to spit out the bitter tea in their mouths. This arrogant fellow had actually escalated his provocations!

The people of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court were also stunned. Senior Brother Qi Zizai was truly too 'bold.' He dared to say such things while standing amidst that group?

They quickly stepped forward, fearing a fight might break out, preparing to intervene!

Qin Ming, of course, was eyeing the 'Immortal Combat Scripture.' He needed to thoroughly stir their emotions, making them fluctuate wildly, otherwise, he couldn't make his move.

Beside him, the white-robed maiden Luo Yao frowned, clenched her fists, and ground her teeth, really wanting to punch his brilliant smiling face. However, standing so close to someone from the Newborn Path, she seemed relatively more endangered.

At the same time, she found the sentence quite familiar. She then remembered saying similar words to a youth on Black-White Mountain several months ago.

“This...” She was utterly depressed. To think she was now being looked down upon by someone from this path, and most crucially, the opponent's battle achievements were right there, dazzlingly brilliant.

“Your 'Immortal Combat Scripture' is not bad, but none of you have truly mastered it.” Qin Ming naturally wanted to strike while the iron was hot. His first target was Li Daocheng.

Because he was a top-tier anomaly, he was undoubtedly a seed disciple nurtured with great importance.

However, he was disappointed. Although Li Daocheng was indignant, a mass of purple mist flowed through his spiritual consciousness, spreading throughout his body and slowly calming him.

This person's will was extremely firm!

Qin Ming didn't want to waste time, so he turned and left, opting for a secondary target.

He coveted that Violet Mansion Thunderflame greatly. If mastered, it would be a terrifying trump card.

He had already mastered the Wind-Thunder Force, and adding this Violet Mansion Thunderflame would truly be wonderful beyond words.

“Junior Sister, the cultivation technique you practice is extraordinary, but I could tell at a glance that your approach has problems, leaving significant hidden dangers. That's why you were easily defeated by me in battle.”

The silver-armored maiden originally had a gentle and elegant demeanor, but now half her face was purplish-black, having suffered a severe backlash from her own thunderflame.

Now, her eyes literally blazed with fury. It was bad enough that this arrogant fellow defeated her, but he even came right in front of her to 'critique her domain'!

Qin Ming smiled and said, “Don't be angry. I'm telling you the truth. Moreover, I can tell you how to cultivate the thunder force. Having fire without thunder can only be considered an incomplete method; you haven't mastered it completely.”

The silver-armored maiden gritted her teeth and said, “You are truly arrogant! Just one spar, and you claim you can instruct me on how to cultivate the Violet Mansion Thunderflame?”

“Of course!” Qin Ming's smile deepened, guiding her to invest emotions into this topic, engaging her in a friendly and cordial exchange.

Immediately, the silver-armored maiden was shocked. What kind of monster was this? He truly was able to give her inspiration and greatly enlighten her!

Qin Ming, naturally, gained immensely from this. His smile grew brighter and increasingly cordial!

Finally, his expression turned serious again. The more he pondered the Violet Mansion Thunderflame, the more profound he found it, as if it could be explored even further.

At this moment, Lu Zizai arrived at a secret location within the Six Imperial Ancestral Court. In the dense fog, there was an enormous exotic bird. Upon sensing his aura, the golden light emitted from its mere opening of its eyes dispersed the night mist, let alone its feathers, which began to glow, practically burning the entire sky.

“Quiet,” Lu Zizai said.

The exotic bird instantly dimmed and its body shrank, finally transforming into a palm-sized golden bird that landed on his shoulder.

Lu Zizai sighed, saying, “Go deliver a letter for me.”
