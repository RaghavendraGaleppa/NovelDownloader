# Chapter 53: Destruction  

"What is Hao Jin doing?" Old Master Hao sensed Hao Jin carrying the third and fourth jars into the courtyard and asked impatiently, his voice heavy with irritation.  

The old cultivator was in a foul mood. The fourth son had been gone all night and should have returned after completing his mission by now. Yet, there was no sign of him. When he noticed Hao Jin disturbing him for no apparent reason, his frustration naturally turned toward the young man.  

He didn’t suspect Hao Jin of betraying the family—he still trusted his clansmen’s loyalty.  

"I’ll reprimand him!" a cultivator below said sternly.  

The cultivator stood up. Their room was on the second floor, and he walked to the railing to look down at Hao Jin.  

By now, Hao Jin had finished the task Li Shiming had assigned him. His mind was foggy, and he stood motionless in a daze. Li Shiming’s hypnosis had been crude, and Hao Jin’s weak will had left his brain damaged from the forced manipulation.  

The Hao family cultivator sensed something was wrong. He leaped down from the second floor and landed beside Hao Jin.  

"Hao Jin, what’s in these jars?" he demanded, frowning at the four large jars beside the young man.  

"What jars?" Hao Jin twisted his neck unnaturally and stared back at the cultivator.  

Just as the cultivator was about to inspect the jars himself, he heard a faint burning sound from one of them.  

**BOOM!**  

A deafening explosion erupted as one of the jars suddenly detonated. The terrifying shockwave struck Hao Jin and the cultivator first. Neither the mortal Hao Jin nor the third-level Qi Refining cultivator had any chance to resist—they were instantly engulfed in scorching flames.  

The explosion wasn’t a single event. The first blast triggered the remaining three jars.  

The first shockwave swept through the entire Hao family compound. A glowing semicircular barrier appeared outside the circular structure, blocking the initial impact.  

This was the first time Li Shiming had seen a defensive formation manifest with his own eyes. It felt like something out of a sci-fi movie—an energy shield existing in this ancient world. This was the world of cultivation.  

But the defensive formation didn’t save the Hao family. Instead, it amplified the explosion’s devastation.  

The first shockwave rebounded inward after being blocked by the outer barrier. Meanwhile, the second, third, and fourth explosions sent shockwaves outward. The conflicting forces collided within the Hao family’s buildings, creating an even more destructive chain reaction.  

Thousands of degrees of scorching heat, combined with the all-consuming force of the blast, clashed violently in the confined space.  

---  

The defensive formation couldn’t withstand such devastation. The semicircular barrier shattered into countless sparks, and the contained flames burst outward.  

In truth, the formation had only held for a single breath, but that brief moment was enough to magnify the explosion’s destructive power far beyond its initial scale.  

Li Shiming had used hypnosis to make Hao Jin transport nitroglycerin into the Hao family compound—over two hundred kilograms of it. This was all the nitroglycerin he had produced since arriving in Zhongdu.  

For the Hao family, he had spared nothing.  

The terrifying shockwave swept past him. Even though he was five hundred meters away and had taken precautions, his heart still pounded with fear.  

When the explosions finally ceased, he crawled out from the dirt but didn’t immediately approach the ruins. Instead, he launched a drone.  

Through the display, the Hao family compound came into view.  

The once-circular structure was gone. Only scattered embers remained, casting a dim light over the gruesome scene in the darkness.  

From above, the drone captured the full extent of the destruction. The Hao family’s estate hadn’t been large, and the surrounding area was still within the drone’s observation range.  

Li Shiming waited in place for about half an hour. By the time the drone’s battery was replaced, the sky had begun to lighten.  

He switched the drone to infrared mode. After so much time, the explosion site no longer had intense heat signatures. Though residual heat still affected the imaging, any living beings would still be detectable.  

The drone descended slightly, sweeping over the ruins several times. Nothing was found.  

Only then did Li Shiming approach the ruins. With his connection to the IBM z15, his five senses became scanning tools for the supercomputer.  

He first found three charred corpses near where he had previously observed the four Hao family cultivators.  

It seemed the Hao family had separated their cultivators from their mortal members—there were no ordinary humans in the cultivators’ area.  

The three corpses were completely carbonized, clustered near the remnants of the defensive formation. It was clear they had been annihilated without any chance to resist.  

From the bodies, Li Shiming retrieved three slightly scorched storage pouches. Testing them, he found they still functioned.  

But the fourth cultivator’s body was nowhere to be found. Without the corpse, locating a small storage pouch in the ruins would be nearly impossible.  

As he searched, Li Shiming noticed several burnt plants at the center of where the Hao family’s circular building had once stood.  

---  

Approaching the plants, he sensed faint traces of spiritual energy seeping from the ground.  

"Is this a spirit vein?" he wondered, recalling Fan Yiyang’s mention of spirit veins during their conversations. The phenomenon matched perfectly.  

The spiritual energy flowing from the vein was similar to what his Spirit Gathering Plate produced.  

But that didn’t mean the plate’s output was fixed. The energy Li Shiming had sensed from it was in a mundane city. If used near a spirit vein, its effects would be significantly enhanced.  

As he absorbed the spiritual energy, a pang of regret struck him.  

Though he coveted the spirit vein, he had no means to exploit it. He couldn’t even conceal its presence, let alone relocate it.  

Suppressing his greed, he examined the plants.  

He pulled up the drone’s earlier footage for comparison. The area had originally been a pond—there had been no plants in sight.  

This meant the Hao family had hidden the plants, likely along with the spirit vein.  

He dug into the soil. After removing the explosion-affected top layer, his hands met earth saturated with spiritual energy.  

"This is spirit soil!" Even without prior experience, he recognized it immediately.  

Without hesitation, he began shoveling the soil into his storage pouch with his bare hands.  

Spirit soil was crafted from numerous spiritual materials, requiring immense resources—far beyond what he could currently afford.  

The layer here was thick. As he dug, he uncovered a section of bamboo root.  

The root had suffered from the explosion, with all its upper parts destroyed. But bamboo roots were resilient—even a fragment of the main root could be revived.
