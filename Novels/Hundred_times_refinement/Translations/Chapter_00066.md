# Chapter 16: Breaking Through with Spirit Pills  

After three years of seeking immortality, this was the first time Lin Xuan felt cultivation could be so effortless and smooth, unlike the arduous struggles of the past.  

Securing the doors and windows, Lin Xuan pulled over a meditation cushion and sat cross-legged on the floor. He took out a jade vial from his robe and poured out nine Marrow Cleansing Pills.  

For this breakthrough attempt, Lin Xuan had gone to great lengths. Just the day before, he had visited the library to consult medicinal texts. Now that he had no shortage of spirit pills, he needed to know: was it truly better to consume more Marrow Cleansing Pills? Would exceeding a certain amount harm his body?  

This was a question he had to clarify. Otherwise, overdosing and suffering side effects would be a regret he couldn’t afford.  

Books on basic cultivation knowledge were available on the first floor of the library. In *Annotations on Medicinal Pills*, Lin Xuan found a passage: *Marrow Cleansing Pills—the lowest and most common pills in the cultivation world, used to enhance the spiritual power of Qi Refinement disciples. Daily intake should not exceed nine pills.*  

The text didn’t specify the consequences of exceeding nine pills, but this information was sufficient for Lin Xuan. He only needed to know the maximum safe dosage.  

Taking out the jade vial, Lin Xuan poured all nine pills into his mouth and began channeling his spiritual energy to assault the bottleneck of the second layer of Qi Refinement.  

The medicinal effects quickly spread through his limbs and bones.  

**Boom!**  

A torrent of scorching heat erupted from his dantian, surging through his meridians. Lin Xuan felt as though he had been thrown into a furnace.  

In the blink of an eye, his clothes were drenched in sweat. The heat inside his body showed no signs of abating—instead, it intensified.  

He had never experienced such a reaction when taking Marrow Cleansing Pills before. Could the book have been wrong? Was consuming so many at once a mistake?  

The thought flickered through his mind, but Lin Xuan didn’t panic. In the face of unexpected situations, staying calm was paramount.  

Though the heat was nearly unbearable, Lin Xuan had already endured the trials of the Heart-Tempering Path. This was nothing in comparison. Gritting his teeth, he ignored the scorching currents raging through his body and focused his mind on stabilizing his dantian. As long as he maintained clarity of spirit, no accidents should occur.  

His judgment proved correct. After about two hours, the heat gradually subsided, replaced by a comforting warmth that suffused his entire body.  

At the same time, the spiritual energy in his dantian began to transform, swelling as though nourished. Its volume alone had doubled compared to before.  

Lin Xuan guided the energy through his meridians, completing a full cycle. Previously, this process had been slow and difficult, but now it felt effortless.  

---  

The situation was better than expected, but Lin Xuan remained composed. As time passed, he entered the most critical phase. His expression grew solemn, his body still as if in deep meditation.  

**Pop.**  

A soft sound, like something shattering, echoed within him. The spiritual energy in his dantian suddenly became unstable—or rather, it began rapidly evolving. Through his spiritual sense, Lin Xuan observed the energy darkening in hue and growing denser.  

Though the gap between the peak of the first layer and the second layer of Qi Refinement was small, the transformation was qualitative.  

Upon breaking through, Lin Xuan immediately noticed the difference. The spiritual energy in his dantian had increased significantly in both quantity and quality.  

Though pleased, Lin Xuan remained calm. This outcome was entirely within his expectations. With such a large supply of Marrow Cleansing Pills, failing to break through would have been the real surprise.  

This success also proved that pills could indeed compensate for his lack of a spiritual root. His confidence in the path of immortality soared.  

After savoring the sensation of reaching the second layer of Qi Refinement, Lin Xuan began planning his next steps. The road ahead was long, and he still lagged far behind his fellow disciples. Catching up was now his top priority.  

For instance, the spirit artifacts he had obtained from Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu couldn’t be used until he reached the fourth layer of Qi Refinement. Until then, they were nothing more than tantalizing treasures. Thus, rapid advancement remained his goal.  

With this in mind, Lin Xuan sat down again, preparing to use internal vision to assess his condition before devising a training plan.  

However, what he discovered next took him by surprise.  

The change came from his dantian. Beyond the growth in spiritual energy, the Star Sea had also expanded, its glowing points more numerous and radiant than before.  

How could this be?  

Resting his chin on his hand, Lin Xuan pondered. Could the Star Sea grow in tandem with his cultivation level? The stronger his spiritual power, the more potent the Star Sea’s energy became?  

At first glance, this seemed implausible, but upon reflection, it made perfect sense. Moreover, it resolved a lingering concern in Lin Xuan’s mind.  

First, there was the issue of purification speed. Though the Star Sea’s light points could regenerate after being consumed, the process took time, limiting the number of pills he could refine. Previously, his Star Sea could only purify two flawed pills at most. Now, with its doubled size, refining four in succession should be feasible.  

Second, this development addressed long-term considerations. Lin Xuan suspected that if the blue light points could purify Marrow Cleansing Pills, they might also refine other types of pills.  

Marrow Cleansing Pills were the lowest-grade spirit medicine, requiring fewer ingredients and containing simpler impurities. Higher-grade pills would have more complex impurities, demanding more light points for purification. If the Star Sea’s size remained unchanged, it might not suffice for refining a single pill.  

Lin Xuan had already tested this—interrupting the purification process would ruin the pill. Though this weakness hadn’t yet posed a problem, foresight was essential. If his speculation was correct—that the Star Sea grew alongside his spiritual power—then this issue would resolve itself.  

Of course, only time would tell. As his cultivation advanced, he would observe whether the Star Sea continued to expand in tandem.
