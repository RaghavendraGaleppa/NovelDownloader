# Chapter 65: The Marvelous Use of Demon Cores

Boom—

The instant the Netherwater Dragon Soul Bell was submerged, the Five Treasures Spirit River surged violently before beginning to roar and churn. A faint oppressive aura filled every corner of the room.

Zhang Jing's expression remained unchanged as he successively took out four other mid-grade magical instruments. Following the sequence of the Five Elements' mutual generation, he fed them one by one into the Five Treasures Spirit River.

As this process continued, the aura of the Five Treasures Spirit River grew increasingly terrifying. Yet when the final instrument—the Profound Gold Heavy Mace—entered the spirit river, the violent energy abruptly vanished. Everything returned to calm.

At the same time, an inexplicable connection faintly emerged between the five instruments.

Zhang Jing couldn't help but observe the current state of the Five Treasures Spirit River. In his vision, the five instruments floated and sank within the river, faintly revolving around the superior-grade Netherwater Dragon Soul Bell at the center, occasionally colliding and producing crisp, melodious clinks.

In the next moment, with a thought from Zhang Jing, the sound of crashing waves rose alongside the clear clanging of magical instruments. Under his control, the Five Treasures Spirit River transformed from utter stillness to extreme motion in an instant. Surging waves carrying an overwhelming momentum capable of crushing and destroying everything rushed toward the brick wall in front of him.

However, just as the wall was about to be obliterated, the Five Treasures Spirit River suddenly disappeared—as if it had all been an illusion.

Huff—

Zhang Jing, seated on his bed, gasped for breath. His face was slightly pale, beads of sweat dotting his forehead, yet his eyes brimmed with unconcealable excitement.

After integrating one powerful superior-grade instrument and four excellent mid-grade instruments, the Five Treasures Spirit River had indeed undergone a qualitative transformation, just as he had anticipated. The full-powered activation had lasted only an instant, but in that brief moment, the terrifying aura it unleashed had sent chills down his spine—even though the attack was under his control.

Subconsciously, Zhang Jing compared the aura of the Five Treasures Spirit River to that of the white deer. To his astonishment, in terms of sheer power, the spirit river's full-powered burst far surpassed the deer's. He even felt it exceeded that of the seventh-level Qi Refinement senior brothers he had encountered, though it fell slightly short when compared to the eighth level.

In summary, the current full-powered attack of the Five Treasures Spirit River likely hovered between the seventh and eighth levels of Qi Refinement.

What if the remaining four instruments were all replaced with superior-grade ones? Zhang Jing mused secretly. But he quickly dismissed the thought—that would be suicidal. A Five Treasures Spirit River composed of five superior-grade instruments would drain him dry with a single activation.

---

At this realization, his spiritual sense involuntarily swept over his dantian, only to find that the once-abundant spiritual energy had dwindled to a mere tenth or two. Zhang Jing frowned slightly.

The Five Treasures Spirit River was indeed formidable, but its consumption was equally staggering! A single full-powered activation had nearly emptied his dantian. This meant he had only one chance—one opportunity to ambush and kill the white deer.

"What if I fail to take it down in one strike, or if something unexpected happens? Would I have to rely on the Five Methods Spirit River then?" Zhang Jing felt uneasy. To him, this seemed far too risky. At the very least, the Five Treasures Spirit River needed to be capable of two or three attacks to give him sufficient confidence.

However, recalling Senior Brother Li's recent advice, Zhang Jing understood that the remaining time wouldn't allow him to break through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement. If all else failed, he might as well collaborate with Senior Brother Li to develop that herb garden.

Wait!

A sudden flash of inspiration struck him. Earlier, when activating the Five Treasures Spirit River, he had noticed that some of the ambient spiritual energy in the room had been absorbed. Did that mean...

He summoned the spirit river again and tossed several spirit stones from his storage bag directly into it. After a dozen breaths, thudding sounds followed as shriveled, dim remnants of the stones fell to the ground.

This might work! Excitement flashed across Zhang Jing's face. But almost immediately, he realized something and his expression settled. While the method was feasible, his current stock of spirit stones was woefully insufficient, and the absorption rate was too slow.

So—demon cores?!

Zhang Jing instantly thought of another item in his possession that contained spiritual energy. If spirit stones wouldn't suffice, perhaps demon cores could. After all, they were condensed from the essence of demonic beasts.

No sooner thought than done. Without hesitation, Zhang Jing retrieved a second-level Qi Refinement demon core and threw it into the Five Treasures Spirit River.

The moment the core entered the river, it was torn apart by the constantly flowing and colliding instruments, releasing a surge of pure spiritual energy. The spirit river rapidly absorbed this energy, which then began circulating endlessly among the five instruments.

Simultaneously, wisps of black smoke were expelled, dissipating into the air.

"Are those the impurities tainted by demonic energy in the core?" Zhang Jing stared at the smoke, comprehension dawning.

---

What followed was exhilaration. Demon cores could indeed substitute for spiritual energy in powering the Five Treasures Spirit River. With this, his greatest concern was resolved.

"Tomorrow morning, I'll head straight to that herb garden. After harvesting the herbs, I'll prepare to return to the Dao Academy," Zhang Jing silently decided.

But just then, he sensed something unusual. Within the illusory great river formed by the Five Viscera Guiding Water Origin Scripture in his body, several strands of unprecedentedly pure spiritual energy had inexplicably appeared. As time passed, this energy grew increasingly abundant, and the moment it emerged, it was directly refined into spiritual power and channeled into his dantian—at an astonishing speed.

"Where is this energy coming from?" Puzzled, Zhang Jing couldn't help but glance at the Five Treasures Spirit River.

Two hours later, after careful study, he had roughly figured out the origin of this mysterious spiritual energy.

In short, when the Five Treasures Spirit River wasn't actively being used, the spiritual energy released from shattered demon cores underwent further purification through the five instruments' elemental cycle. This refined energy then seeped into the illusory river within him via the special connection between the spirit river and the river's projection.

Compared to medicinal herbs, this energy was purer and far more suitable for his refinement!

Once everything became clear, Zhang Jing immediately realized he might have stumbled upon a cultivation method that was faster and more efficient than consuming herbs or pills.

Feeling the stirrings of his cultivation base, determination flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. Without hesitation, he tossed the recently acquired sixth-level Qi Refinement demon core into the Five Treasures Spirit River and closed his eyes, fully concentrating on operating the Five Viscera Guiding Water Origin Scripture.

His earlier plans were revised once more. First, he would go into seclusion to break through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement. Only then would he deal with that white deer. With the aid of this sixth-level demon core, there was ample time.

---

Two days later, the door of the talisman shop creaked open, revealing Zhang Jing's figure. His aura had unmistakably reached the fifth level of Qi Refinement.

Moreover, with his advancement, the Five Methods Spirit River had undergone another transformation—its capacity for spells had increased to thirty-two, while the Five Treasures Spirit River could now accommodate eight instruments. However, Zhang Jing had no immediate plans to add more instruments.

There simply wasn't a need. At his current fifth-level Qi Refinement, he could barely manage five full-powered activations of the Five Treasures Spirit River, with each attack's potency barely approaching the eighth level.

Adding more mid-grade instruments wouldn't significantly boost its power, and it would only return him to the awkward predicament of being a "one-shot wonder" at the fourth level. As a man, Zhang Jing absolutely refused to accept that.

Besides, he now had more pressing matters to attend to.

Before long, a spirit crane carried Zhang Jing into the skies, soaring straight toward the southeastern outskirts of Langya County City.
