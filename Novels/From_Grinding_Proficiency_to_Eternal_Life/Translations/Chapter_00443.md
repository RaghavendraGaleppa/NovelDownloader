# Chapter 443: All Things in Heaven and Earth Are Mere Nourishment for the Self

It was no wonder that in the path of immortality, it was often said that cultivation knew no seasons. Refining a single spell or comprehending a single divine ability could easily pass several years.

Xu Yunfan walked out of the True Martial Cave Mansion and looked up towards the peak, where the others were basking in the morning glow and the purple qi of dawn under the sun's brilliance.

The twelve old masters from the Dao Sect all had spiritual light flickering around them, yet not one had broken through to the Realm of Enlightenment.

His spiritual sense swept over them, and he discovered that the one with the highest cultivation had only just barely touched the threshold of guiding qi into the body. They had not even reached the Foundation Establishment stage.

Xu Yunfan secretly shook his head. Although there was the reason that their meridians were not yet fully formed within their bodies, such slowness was still somewhat beyond his expectations. It was even slower than the progress of the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect.

On second thought, the Primordial Origin Sect always had a flood of people joining the sect each time, but those who survived in the end were all individuals with exceptional aptitude and good fortune; otherwise, they would have long been used up as consumables. The Primordial Origin Sect's methods of skinning, boiling bones, refining blood, and summoning the Five Fierce—truly, all categories were complete. There was not a single part of the human body that was wasted.

"Master."

Xu Yunfan bowed respectfully as Bi Yuan, who was walking slowly towards him.

The old man, a ninth-grade Qi Refining cultivator, had a few more strands of frost at his temples. The hem of his Daoist robe still carried the lingering scent of alchemical fire, yet his aura had grown even deeper.

Xu Yunfan glanced at him slightly and came to a decisive conclusion. Half a foot had already stepped into the Land of Earthly Immortals. Next, he only needed to cultivate the True Martial Subduing Devil Sutra step by step. Within two years, he would be able to step into the ultimate realm of martial arts. Then, he could begin the method of breathing and refining essence, transforming true qi into true essence, and naturally enter the early stage of Qi Refining. Once he reached the early stage of Qi Refining, he would be like a fish leaping into the vast sea, able to roam freely.

Daoist Bi Yuan stared intently at the disciple before him and suddenly let out a long sigh. "Back in my day, I entered the Dao in a hundred days. My flesh, bones, and skin were perfected in just five years of practice, and I was hailed as a genius rarely seen in a hundred years. Now, after nearly half a year of bitter cultivation, I can't even capture the qi sensation of the Land of Earthly Immortals."

He shook his head slightly and sighed, "The path of immortality is truly arduous. It is no wonder, no wonder that in the Dao Sect for thousands of years, only the Patriarch of Pure Yang has ever emerged."

Xu Yunfan looked at his master's slightly dejected expression and smiled softly. "Master, do not be anxious. Once you step into the early stage of Qi Refining and complete the sect's missions, you will understand the true essence of the Primordial Origin Sect's path of immortality."

He said, "All things in heaven and earth are, in themselves, nourishment for the cultivator."

Daoist Bi Yuan frowned upon hearing this. "Yunfan, what you said..."

"That is why the Primordial Origin Sect is known as the 'Primordial Demon Sect'," Xu Yunfan said. The Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl in his sleeve grew slightly warm, casting a green light that flickered in his eyes. "Look at the true lords within the sect; most of them are majestic in their Dao methods and solemn in their bearing. Yet, when they gather herbs, they dare to drain spiritual veins dry, and when they forge artifacts, they can sacrifice entire cities in blood."

Suddenly, a scream came from a distance—a newly accepted disciple had gone berserk. Yet, Xu Yunfan didn't even lift an eyelid. "Righteous cultivators say we are utterly heartless, but the pills they use for their breakthroughs, which one of them isn't refined from a hundred years of essence stolen from plants and trees?"

All things in heaven and earth are mere nourishment for the self; everything is firewood to be sacrificed for the self.

Bi Yuan opened his mouth, his heart knowing that the scream just now was from a disciple who had joined the True Martial Peak two months ago. He also understood that if he acted with the style of a righteous path in the Primordial Origin Sect, he would likely be branded a deviant and ostracized. Everyone is wickedly doing just fine; why do you have to learn from the righteous path? Are you an undercover agent?!

The mountain wind swept across the stone platform, carrying the smell of blood. The disciple who had gone berserk was already being dragged away, leaving a long trail of blood.

Xu Yunfan stared at the bloodstain and said softly, "So-called demon lords are merely those who practice the saying 'Heaven and Earth treat all things as straw dogs' more thoroughly than others."

Watching Bi Yuan's departing figure, Xu Yunfan shook his head slightly. Although this old Daoist was ruthless in his actions, he had a sense of loyalty and righteousness in his heart, especially caring for his disciples. It was just like with Bi Sheng; although Bi Yuan often scolded and beat him, it was also a form of elder brother's care. It was a pity that Bi Sheng was unwilling to come; otherwise, the True Martial Peak would have had some interesting affairs.

Gathering his thoughts, Xu Yunfan took out the Ten Thousand Soul Banner and gently stroked its surface, a thoughtful look in his eyes. Should he go and exchange for a few true scriptures? He had already stepped into Foundation Establishment, but he had yet to use any of the benefits given by the Primordial Origin Sect.

A voice came from within the banner: "Daoist Lord, it seems your cultivation has greatly improved?"

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. "Senior Uncle-Grandmaster can see this clearly?"

Zhang Ziyang laughed, "Although your aura is restrained perfectly, I can still see some clues. Your cultivation has advanced; this is a good thing."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, naturally understanding in his heart that the talent of this former sect master of the Dao Sect was exceptionally high. If he hadn't been constrained by his lifespan and had to practice the incense-fire divine path, leaving him with only a physical shell, his speed of cultivation would have been astonishing. It was none other than his comprehension ability that was truly monstrous. Especially a few days ago, when Xu Yunfan explained the *True Martial Subduing Devil Sutra* to Zhang Ziyang, the latter started with a posture of seeking advice, but later was able to engage in a debate on the Dao. If it weren't for Xu Yunfan having the attribute panel and knowing all the various subtleties of the *True Martial Subduing Devil Sutra* after its great success, he might not have been able to win the debate. Moreover, sometimes a few words during their Dao debate could give him a sudden insight, causing the proficiency of the *True Martial Subduing Devil Sutra* to rise significantly due to his epiphany. To be honest, having Zhang Ziyang inside the Ten Thousand Soul Banner was like loading an external cultivation accelerator. His talent was truly monstrous.

After a pause, Zhang Ziyang said, "If the Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl granted to you by that True Lord is depleted, I'm afraid the cultivation of the Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppression Fortune Method will come to a halt."

He said with some distress, "This method involves karmic changes, stirring one's own fate, consuming one's own merit, and carrying the aura of fortune. To this day, I still can't grasp its principles."

This was precisely what Xu Yunfan was worried about. Although the Azure Dragon Saliva within the Thunder Pearl could aid cultivation, it was ultimately a consumable item.

Xu Yunfan rubbed the Thunder Pearl in his palm, feeling the gradually thinning dragon's breath within it. According to the current intensity of his training, this Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl would have its spiritual charm depleted in at most three years. He looked up towards the direction of the Celestial Palace. Unless Lord Qingyuan bestows his favor again and grants more Azure Dragon Saliva, such a treasure that can accelerate cultivation would be impossible for him to obtain with his Foundation Establishment cultivation.

"There is no need to worry too much. When the cart reaches the mountain, there will be a path. Senior Uncle-Grandmaster, there is no need to be concerned," Xu Yunfan said. He looked inward at his Dantian, where the thread of his natal thunder sword was swallowing the remaining essence of the Thunder Pearl. On the attribute panel, the proficiency of the *Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppression Fortune Method* was still slowly increasing under his own cultivation. Although it was not as swift as when aided by the Thunder Pearl, with the solid foundation of the *True Martial Subduing Devil Sutra* and the concealment methods of the Turtle Breathing Hiding Spirit Technique, the speed of cultivation was not considered sluggish.

Zhang Ziyang's soul form flickered on the surface of the banner and nodded. "Since you have gained the favor of the True Lord, you are not a rootless duckweed. This Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl is wonderful, but it is ultimately an external object..."

"Rest assured, Senior Uncle-Grandmaster," Xu Yunfan said with a smile. "Your disciple has always believed that 'the bow will straighten when the arrow is released'. Since Lord Qingyuan bestowed this method, he would not let me be stuck at a bottleneck. I understand the situation clearly."

Upon hearing this, Zhang Ziyang nodded slightly and said no more.
