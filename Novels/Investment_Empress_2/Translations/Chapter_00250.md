# Chapter 250: Lost in the Ice, The Execution Grounds

Gulp—

Next to her, a little girl with her hair braided with grass ropes stared at the sweet mooncakes, drooling, but only dared to suck on her fingers.

"You mustn't stare at the Wu Zhe."

The little girl's mother was thin and withered, like a stalk of straw standing in a field. She looked at Ying Bing with a fawning, fearful gaze, just like the other villagers. This was also why the villagers didn't dare to approach her.

A young lady who looked like a celestial maiden, walking alone in the Southern Frontier—she was either a powerful martial artist, a servant of the Witch Spirits, or perhaps a terrifyingly strong Great Demon in human form.

Ying Bing was familiar with that gaze.

In the past, when she descended, the common people revered her even more like gods.

It was something she used to take for granted.

So why was it... that she couldn't get used to it now?

"You can try one."

Ying Bing summoned a wisp of cloud mist, gently floating a mooncake into the little girl's arms.

"Thank you, Fairy Sister!"

The little girl was overjoyed. However, the surrounding people, especially the girl's mother, suddenly changed expressions drastically. She knelt on the ground, kowtowing repeatedly.

"Great One, she is still young, please spare her."
"Please, I beg you."

She hit her head hard on the first kowtow, blood and sweat mixing with the dirt, making it hard to distinguish.

"I have no malicious intent."

A ray of moonlight fell in broad daylight, enveloping the woman.

If she hadn't used her Intent Soul, this misunderstanding恐怕 would not have been resolved. The little girl took a bite of the mooncake and said happily that it was sweet. Only then did the woman believe that this cold, ethereal young lady meant no harm.

But aside from the little girl, no one else dared to approach her.

"Sister, this is the map you wanted."
"Thank you."

Ying Bing took the map. Seeing the little girl take a bite of the chibi-style Little Li, she was slightly stunned for a moment. A moment later, she lowered her head and examined the rough hunter's map.

"Heavenly Fairy Sister, who are you thinking about?"

Fuyingzi, the little girl, put the mooncake away and asked curiously.

"I am looking at the map."

Ying Bing smoothed out the map, her clear eyes pausing as she gently shook her head.

"But when Mama misses Papa, she makes that exact expression."

Fuyingzi tilted her head and pointed to the mountain path not far away.
"Sister, what mountain is that?"

The little girl's eyes were pure and innocent, yet the question left Ying Bing speechless.

"That is..."

Ying Bing's jade-like face froze.

She had just been looking at the map. This mountain was so close to Baoping Town; she remembered seeing it. How could she suddenly not remember?

So the young lady lowered her eyes to look at the map again.

Outside is Li Mo Mountain, next to the mountain is Li Mo River, and by the Li Mo River is Li Mo Forest, where the Li Mo tribe lives...

"?"

Ying Bing's clear gaze stopped.

"This is Baoping Town, so the mountain is naturally called Baoping Mountain!"

Fuyingzi suddenly felt that this sister wasn't scary after all.

Just then.

The sunlight seemed to be blocked by something, and the map full of Little Li instantly darkened.

Ying Bing looked up.

She saw a massive Peng bird, its wings spread like black clouds pressing down, descending with an endless, fierce aura. Its sharp beak opened, and it actually spoke human words:

"Jiejiejie!"
"Let Grandpa see if there are any children to eat!"

The common people instantly panicked, scattering in a disorderly crowd, fleeing in all directions.

The Great Peng bird circled in the air. Suddenly, its excellent vision caught the little girl running while hugging the mooncakes. It let out another strange laugh and swooped down violently.

A gale swept through.

Fuyingzi was frightened to the point her little face turned pale; her small body was already covered by the Peng's shadow.

And at this moment, a moonlight suddenly appeared in the daytime.

The Great Peng bird's figure abruptly halted.

Because a frost-like long sword had appeared at its neck. The cold light radiating from it was just a fraction away from cutting its throat.

The owner of the sword was the celestial maiden-like young lady.

"Do you know the way to the Qing Luan tribe?"

The young lady's light voice rang out.

---

"You dare..."

The Great Peng bird spoke in a dry, raspy voice, wanting to threaten her.

*Swish—*

The moonlight sword light flashed and vanished.

Feathers drifted down.

The Great Peng bird suddenly felt a chill on top of its head, as cold as the sword light just now, as cold as the eyes of that noble young lady.

"The Qing Luan upper tribe hates humans and all males..."

*Swish—*

The young lady said no more; the sword light flashed again.

The Great Peng bird became even more bald. The originally fierce eyes actually welled up with a sense of heartbreak and grievance.

"Let's talk this out! We can reason together!"
"Birds need beautiful feathers for courtship, especially on the head..."

***

On the other side.

Three bronze horses pulled a carriage, their four hooves flying. At this moment, it wasn't just a figure of speech. The carriage was truly flying at low altitude, allowing it to travel as if on flat ground over the Southern Frontier's terrain, which was sometimes twisted, sometimes desolate, and sometimes muddy.

Leaving the Southern Pass in early autumn, Li Mo and the others finally exited the pass before the autumn air was too high, about to reach the first stop entering the Southern Frontier.

In the distance, the continuous, majestic mountain range could already be seen.

"This place doesn't seem very lively."

Li Mo looked out through the black cloud gauze on the carriage window. He used the black cloud gauze to simulate clothing that fit the Southern Frontier style, wearing a headband on his forehead, and his black clothes embroidered with strange beasts.

Along the way, he had seen many scenes where prosperity and decay coexisted, and many lives surviving in the cracks.

Compared to the fortresses seen along the way, Baoping Town was not prosperous.

Huang Donglai nodded.

"This place is surrounded by mountains on three sides, and very few merchants pass through, so naturally, the population is much sparser."
"But as long as you don't carry too much baggage and have fast enough travel, this is an excellent place to head towards the Ming Jiao tribe territory."

Li Mo looked at the map, recalling what Huang Donglai had told him during this time.

The closer they got to the Southern Pass, the more well-behaved the demon tribes were, and the denser the garrisoned troops became. The deeper they went into the Southern Frontier, the weaker the influence of Great Yu became. The guardians of peace were no longer the garrison troops, but the 'Witch Spirits' worshipped by the people.

"Brother Li, that..."

Murong Xiao, having finished his daily功课 to suppress his bloodline, spoke awkwardly.

"Finished again?"

Li Mo was speechless. He took out a gold brick and skillfully broke it into small pieces of gold beans.

"Yeah... I'll definitely pay you back when we return to Ziyang Prefecture."

Murong Xiao's expression grew increasingly ashamed.

"What, you want to accumulate merit alone?"

Li Mo laughed and shook his head, taking out medicinal herbs and grain as well.

The more chaotic the world, the more human lives are like grass.

Murong Xiao, adhering to the words 'just do good deeds,' never stood by idly when seeing suffering along the way.

With his kind nature, he would have done it even if it wasn't for suppressing his bloodline.

Actually, quite a bit of it counted as Li Mo's investment.

Well, it couldn't really be called an investment.

Perhaps it was because his realm was getting higher.

Even saving the life of an ordinary person brought very little feedback.

After preparing the alms for Murong Xiao, the carriage had already reached the town entrance.

Under the archway with the words 'Baoping'.

However, just as they reached the town entrance, they saw a crowd of people in the distance. Southern Frontier people in strange clothes were gathered there, and the sound of discussion was endless.

"How could Fuyingzi collude with demons?"
"She spoke a few words to that fairy that day; couldn't that fairy be a demon?"
"Stop the child's mother! You can't offend the military officers..."

Hmm?

Li Mo's eyebrows raised.

His gaze passed through the crowd and saw a thin, weak girl kneeling on the platform. She was frightened to the point her face had no color, her lips pale.

A bare-chested executioner was drinking strong liquor; the broadsword was thicker than the girl's waist.

Looking at the sky, the official sitting on the high platform shouted loudly:

"The time has come!"
"Execute!"
