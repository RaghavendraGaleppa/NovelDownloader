# Chapter 93: Pick for Yourself!

Gu Yuan's flying light moved slowly, not particularly swift, as if he were waiting for something. However, after hovering in the air for a few moments and seeing no one pursuing him, he immediately accelerated his flight, leaving Yunxuan Island and heading toward Qian Yuan Cave.

But before his flying light could land on Jinyuan Island, he noticed a bustling scene—crowds of people, colorful robes everywhere, all gathered around his Qian Yuan Cave.

"Senior Brother Gu, is that you returning?"  

Just as Gu Yuan was puzzled, an enthusiastic call came from the entrance of Qian Yuan Cave.  

Gu Yuan descended and saw a young man in an eight-leaf Daoist robe with the character "Jiang" embroidered on his sleeves, waving at him warmly.  

This person looked familiar—he was one of the competitors for the Mystic Grass earlier that day.  

Behind the young man stood over twenty tall and beautiful women, adorned in colorful garments and jade ornaments. Each held a different gift: golden bells, jade cups, coral trees… At a glance, it was a dazzling display of treasures.  

"Senior Brother Gu, you’ve finally returned! I didn’t even attend the Mystic Grass banquet—I’ve been waiting here the whole time!"  

The young man acted as if they were old friends, stepping forward to grasp Gu Yuan’s hand, but Gu Yuan subtly avoided it.  

Undeterred, the young man settled for clutching Gu Yuan’s sleeve, his enthusiasm undiminished.  

"Junior Brother Jiang, if you have something to say, speak plainly…"  

Gu Yuan sighed helplessly.  

He already had an inkling of why the young man was here.  

The Green Peak Daoist Academy had a long history, with numerous influential families, and social interactions were often lively. Disciples from prominent clans frequently gathered for banquets and revelry, enjoying life to the fullest.  

However, the Hidden Dragon Court mostly consisted of humble disciples, so it remained quiet, with most students secluded in their cultivation.  

But once someone gained fame, this peace would inevitably be disturbed.  

"Senior Brother Gu, today you outshone all others, your brilliance unmatched! I truly admire you!"  

"I was blind before, never having paid you a visit. Today, I’ve come to make amends—here are three hundred spirit stones, a coral jade tree, a calming golden bell…"  

As he apologized, the young man handed Gu Yuan a gift list.  

"Those who follow the Dao seek purity and simplicity. Such lavish gifts are unnecessary."  

"We’ve never met before, so there’s no need for ‘amends.’ Please leave."  

Gu Yuan flicked his sleeve, shaking the young man off, then turned and entered his cave.  

"Senior Brother Gu! Senior Brother Gu! I have a younger sister, just sixteen, peerlessly beautiful—"  

The young man’s shouts continued behind him, but Gu Yuan had already activated the cave’s formation, vanishing from sight.  

In the distance, two more grand processions, adorned with colorful banners, had just entered Jinyuan Island. Seeing this, they could only stomp their feet in frustration.  

---  

For cultivators, unless they achieve the Great Dao, social interactions are unavoidable—especially in major sects.  

But being entangled in trivial matters before reaching Foundation Establishment is unwise. Offering petty benefits in hopes of binding a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator—one with the potential to reach Foundation Establishment—was nothing short of laughable.  

Gu Yuan activated the cave’s formation, cutting off all disturbances, then took out the jade box containing the Golden-Severing Mystic Grass.  

*"Zheng!"*  

A faint sword hum echoed through the cave, accompanied by glimmers of golden light.  

"I’ve delayed long enough. It’s time to break through this barrier and complete the final step."  

Gu Yuan smiled as he gazed at the radiant, luminous Mystic Grass in the box.  

Among the ninth level of Qi Refining, this final hurdle had consumed much of his time, requiring multiple attempts. But once he consumed the Mystic Grass, everything would fall into place.  

After this, he could focus on preparing for Foundation Establishment.  

Compared to the ninth level of Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment was the true challenge.  

Fortunately, he already had some ideas.  

*"Zheng! Zheng!"*  

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan took the Mystic Grass and swallowed it whole.  

This grass was extraordinary—it required no refinement and could be consumed directly.  

*"Shua!"*  

As soon as it entered his mouth, the grass seemed to come alive, writhing like a golden fish or a sharp sword, rampaging through his body.  

*"Zheng!"*  

*"Dang!"*  

Amidst the collisions, the sound of clashing swords rang out. Gu Yuan felt the previously immovable shackles within him being sliced apart by an invisible blade, crumbling bit by bit.  

*"Hong!"*  

The spiritual energy in the cave surged of its own accord, flooding into Gu Yuan’s body.  

*"Hualala!"*  

The sound of a great river flowing echoed endlessly as Gu Yuan’s aura climbed steadily higher.  

Not only that, but the river’s roar was accompanied by sharp sword hums. The Peach Sword Seal in Gu Yuan’s dantian, wrapped in surging spiritual energy, grew increasingly radiant, as if forged from molten gold, its edges exuding a chilling sharpness.  

A dazzling brilliance flickered unceasingly.  

*"Xiu!"*  

But at that moment, a sharp inhale echoed through the cave.  

The last spiritual fruit on the Little Giant Divine Tree transformed into a streak of cyan light and was swallowed by Gu Yuan.  

The spiritual energy within him, which had been on the verge of stabilizing, surged wildly once more, growing stronger and stronger.  

---  

*"Hu—"*  

After a long while, Gu Yuan exhaled deeply, and the turbulent energy within him gradually settled.  

"The spiritual energy required for the ninth level of Qi Refining is several times greater than the eighth. Reaching the peak without several years of cultivation would be impossible…"  

Gu Yuan opened his eyes, sensing the vast but still somewhat empty dantian and meridians within him, and couldn’t help but sigh.  

Cultivation was far from simple.  

Even though he had plundered many spirit stones, it only meant he could sustain secluded cultivation without needing to seek external resources.  

But shortening the time required for cultivation was no easy feat.  

Gentle elixirs, which didn’t harm one’s foundation, offered limited potency and only marginally reduced the time needed. Potent medicines could drastically speed up cultivation, but avoiding damage to one’s foundation was difficult.  

Thus, Gu Yuan’s Little Giant Divine Tree was truly a stroke of fortune—it allowed him to break through realms swiftly without harming his foundation.  

Apart from this, only rare treasures or supreme-grade elixirs could achieve similar effects.  

"I still have many spirit stones left. If I seek out treasures that enhance cultivation, I should be able to afford them…"  

"But if I do that, I’ll need another plan for Foundation Establishment resources…"  

"If only Bian Chuyao were more cooperative…"  

Weighing his current assets, Gu Yuan sighed again.  

He had no intention of giving up on the Zhongshan Secret Ruins.  

The Three Hearts Seal was a rare body seal. Obtaining it would not only greatly aid his future cultivation but also serve as an indispensable asset for Foundation Establishment.  

Even without Bian Chuyao’s invitation, he would have found a way to enter the ruins and search for the seal. Since she had invited him, he naturally intended to hitch a ride—and extract some benefits in the process.  

It was like using public funds for personal affairs—he had to take advantage where he could.  

But to his surprise, after all her sweet talk and grand promises, Bian Chuyao had gone silent?  

Had she given up so easily?  

*"Dang!"*  

Just as Gu Yuan was pondering this, the sound of a golden sword rang out in the cave.  

With a thought, Gu Yuan opened a gap in the cave’s formation, allowing a golden message sword to land in his palm.  

On the sword was a long list of spiritual herbs, treasures, and elixirs.  

At the end of the list were three elegantly written, confident words:  

**"Pick for yourself!"**
