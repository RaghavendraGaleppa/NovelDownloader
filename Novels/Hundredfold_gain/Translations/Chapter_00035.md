# Chapter 35: Instant Incineration, An Opportunity (Seeking Follow-up Reads)

On the small rocky island, two crimson flames surged upward. The fire twisted and coiled like living tentacles, unleashing terrifying heat that annihilated everything within its grasp.

From within the flames came two short, agonized shrieks of demonic beasts.

In mere moments, the crimson flames receded, revealing two charred demonic corpses lying silently on the ground. Though blackened, their outlines still clearly identified them as Watermist Crocodiles—now utterly lifeless.

"Is this the terrifying power of a perfected Fireball Technique? Truly a formidable skill even among late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators," Qi Chan'er murmured, her expression filled with awe as she gazed at the two Watermist Crocodiles that had been threatening her just moments ago.

She had known the Fireball Technique was effective against these creatures, but her own rudimentary mastery had been insufficient against mid-tier first-grade Watermist Crocodiles—unless she had reached minor mastery, it would have been useless against four of them. The perfected Fireball Technique's sheer power left her stunned.

"With two of the four Watermist Crocodiles gone, the remaining two are no longer a threat," Qi Chan'er thought, suppressing her amazement as she turned her attention to the last two beasts with a faint smile.

Earlier, four had cornered her, but now, two were manageable. She immediately channeled her spiritual energy.

*Hum.*

A condensed golden light shot from her Golden Light Ring, piercing through the air unerringly to strike one crocodile in the neck. The beast stiffened before collapsing lifelessly to the ground. Against a single mid-tier first-grade Watermist Crocodile, her high-grade Golden Light Ring had no trouble securing a kill.

*Whoosh!* *Thud!*

At the same time, the last crocodile's head flew into the air, blood gushing like a fountain from its severed neck. A small gray shadow darted through the air before silently returning to a pale, outstretched hand.

Qi Chan'er followed the movement and saw a handsome young man in the inner disciple robes of the Fengyue Sect, a faint smile on his lips as he toyed with a gray-hued dagger.

"It really is you. Thank you for saving me," she said, her delicate face showing no surprise, only sincere gratitude.

When she had first heard the sigh during her desperate moment, she had been startled—uncertain whether the newcomer was friend or foe. But upon seeing the perfected Fireball Techniques, she had already guessed who it might be. In the Qi Refinement realm, few possessed such mastery over the Fireball Technique, and even fewer would intervene to save her. The familiar face before her only confirmed her suspicions.

"No need for thanks. We both hail from the Qi family—helping each other is only natural," Qi Chuan replied, twirling the high-grade dagger, *Flying Ash*, in his hand.

He had hesitated briefly before deciding to intervene. Though they were from the same family, he had no obligation to act. Yet, seeing her in peril, he had chosen to step in.

"However, I'll be taking the teeth from these four Watermist Crocodiles. Any objections?" Qi Chuan gestured toward the corpses.

Two had been slain cleanly—one by Qi Chan'er's Golden Light Ring, the other by his dagger. The remaining two, though charred by his Fireball Techniques, still had intact teeth.

"Of course not," Qi Chan'er quickly replied. How could she protest when he had saved her life?

Without further ado, Qi Chuan flicked his wrist, sending *Flying Ash* darting through the air to harvest the teeth from all four crocodiles.

"Four sets of Watermist Crocodile teeth—three inner sect contribution points per set. Combined with the three sets I already had, that's twenty-one points in total. At an exchange rate of ten spirit stones per point, this trip has netted me two hundred and ten low-grade spirit stones. Enough to buy twenty-one Gathering Yuan Pills—almost two years' worth of cultivation resources," Qi Chuan mused inwardly, pleased with the haul.

"I came to the Black Marsh to hunt these crocodiles, but I only found a few stragglers earlier. Seems you drew them all here," he remarked casually as he finished collecting the teeth.

"Not exactly," Qi Chan'er corrected. "Watermist Crocodiles are pack hunters. There should have been far more than this. Even these four are just scattered remnants of what used to be a dense population."

"Oh? Why is that?" Qi Chuan asked, surprised. If the crocodiles were dwindling, future hunting missions would become much harder, cutting off a steady source of contribution points.

"I'm not sure. Maybe years of hunting have thinned their numbers, or perhaps something recently changed in the Cloudrise Mountains," Qi Chan'er mused, shaking her head. "I've come here several times over the past few months and rarely saw any. That's why I let my guard down today."

She then produced a dark-hued spiritual herb. "This is why I came—the outer sect has a collection mission for these."

"Black Profound Grass," Qi Chuan noted, nodding. He had no intention of taking it—he had already claimed the crocodile teeth, so she deserved her own reward.

After exchanging a few more words and sharing insights about the Fengyue Sect and the Cloudrise Mountains, Qi Chuan glanced around the island once more. "With these teeth, my mission is complete. I should head back to report. We'll part ways here."

"Alright," Qi Chan'er agreed, though she hesitated. A few words of thanks and some crocodile teeth hardly repaid a life debt. The Black Profound Grass in her hand wasn't valuable enough either. She would have to remember this favor for the future.

As Qi Chuan turned to leave, hovering slightly above the ground, Qi Chan'er clenched her fists and finally called out.

"Qi Chuan!"

He turned back, puzzled. "What is it?"

With a determined expression, she asked, "Would you be interested in exploring an opportunity with me?"
