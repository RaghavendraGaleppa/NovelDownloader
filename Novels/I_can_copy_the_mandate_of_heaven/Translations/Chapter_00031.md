# 31, Mimicking the Dragon Elephant

“Did you remember much?” Doctor Mo gradually ceased his practice. His hands, once as large as millstones and shimmering with silver light, quickly deflated like punctured balls, visibly relaxing and shrinking until they returned to their withered, bony state.

It seemed that his age was catching up to him, as simply performing this palm technique was a significant drain on his energy. He even began to breathe heavily, with a hint of self-satisfaction regarding his just-performed technique evident between his brows.

However, when he turned around, the self-satisfaction on his face had vanished, replaced by a calm as still water. He simply raised an eyebrow slightly, looking at Li Zhiming.

Li Zhiming had indeed seen it clearly.

When Doctor Mo used his palm technique, the qi flowed between his arms. Although he couldn't fully grasp the technique's intricacies in that short time, he still managed to observe seventy or eighty percent of it. But this technique had taken Doctor Mo forty years of painstaking study, so how could a young child fully comprehend it after just one viewing?

“Student remembered a bit,” Li Zhiming replied.

Doctor Mo nodded, looking uninterested. “I’ve written down the method for the Demon Silver Hand. You can study it yourself in the future; don't come asking me.”

“You’ve been teaching yourself to read these past few years, right?” Doctor Mo hadn’t taught Li Zhiming to read. He'd taught Han Li to read so he could memorize the herbal medicine rhymes, but Li Zhiming had an extremely high foundation in medical skills and thus had learned advanced medicine mixing and pharmacology directly from Doctor Mo. However, Han Li had started teaching Li Zhiming how to read in secret, and his progress had been incredibly rapid. What took Han Li one or two years, he'd mastered in a single month.

Doctor Mo took out two books and tossed them to Li Zhiming, who quickly caught them. One, a deep blue book, had the antique characters “Demon Silver Hand” written on the cover. The other, an old, earthy yellow book, had the straightforward title “Seven Armored Elephant Skill.”

“The second book is something I found in the Seven Mysteries Sect. It was initially developed by a powerful figure within the sect, but its cultivation difficulty was too high, too idealistic. Even its creator couldn’t cultivate it to the predicted highest level. It requires immense willpower. I see that you're precocious, so you can give it a try. I don't expect much; even if you only cultivate the first level, it will greatly benefit you in your future journeys. Take it and study it carefully yourself. Don't come asking me, as I don't understand it either. I’m tired.” With that, Doctor Mo conjured a ruler from his sleeve and lightly struck Li Zhiming on the head three times before turning and walking away.

Only when Doctor Mo had completely disappeared from sight did Li Zhiming finally let out a difficult breath. Was that it? Had he passed? Had Doctor Mo ultimately raised the matter highly but then put it down gently? But why? Li Zhiming was momentarily dazed.

Leaving the valley, a rustling sound startled Li Zhiming. Turning his head, he saw Han Li emerging from the bushes. He appeared fully armed and armored, his expression stern.

“What are you doing here?” Li Zhiming asked.

“What do you think?” Han Li glanced into the distance, avoiding a direct answer.

A warmth spread through Li Zhiming's heart.

Returning to the valley, Li Zhiming, relieved from the earlier scare, took out the two books his master had given him and began to study them carefully. He was most interested in the 'Demon Silver Hand' that his master had taught him. How many people could withstand the power of those fan-like hands when they struck out?

Opening the book, Li Zhiming found that, although his literacy had greatly improved, the writing style was profound and obscure, making it difficult to read. Nevertheless, Li Zhiming didn't say anything and simply persisted, slowly and laboriously trying to understand it.

The 'Demon Silver Hand' was a martial art classified as a "palm technique" with astonishing power. It required the use of medicinal soaks to prepare the hands before one could ultimately reach that level. However, this process could not be accomplished in less than ten years! One had to endure great hardship! Upon reading this, Li Zhiming was greatly surprised, but also filled with anticipation. How terrifying would the power of the Demon Silver Hand be once it reached perfection?

Li Zhiming glanced at Han Li, who was lying down and pretending to nap, his back facing him. In fact, Li Zhiming knew everything Han Li had been doing outside these past years. For example:

[Great things take time] [Reincarnated Old Devil] [Cautious Nature] [Pseudo Spiritual Root]

Literacy Level 2: You have a basic understanding of text.

Pharmacology Identification Level 4: You have a basic understanding of pharmacology.

Evergreen Technique (446/1300)

Rippling Smoke Steps (980/1000)

Blinking Sword Technique (712/1000)

…Caution Unknown, Unable to Copy

See, that's what Han Li had been doing all these years.

Li Zhiming turned back and continued to read the book in his hand. After generally reading the cultivation method of the 'Demon Silver Hand,' Li Zhiming took a deep breath. The book stated that it was not recommended to practice it before the age of fourteen, as it could easily ruin one's bones. Therefore, Li Zhiming could only switch to the other book.

“Seven Armored Elephant Skill.”

This was a cultivation method that had an immediate sense of age. The yellowed and old booklet was clearly one that had been stored for many years, one that Doctor Mo must have stolen from some place. Thinking about the fact that the Seven Mysteries Sect hadn't bothered to look into the matter of the book's disappearance, it was clear that even though the Seven Armored Elephant Skill was powerful, the reason must be that nobody actually practiced it.

Li Zhiming opened the cultivation method that Doctor Mo had left for him. The book began with the author's own notes, “In ancient times, there were Dragon Elephants, rampaging between heaven and earth, unstoppable by humans.”

“All beasts are fierce, but the human race is weak in flesh and blood.”

“Martial arts are but a small path, good for slaughtering chickens and dogs, brawling with people; in retreat, they still fear the power of heaven and earth, the bravery of all beasts; in advancement, they are no more than drawing swords in the marketplace, killing people and severing heads. Only by emulating the ancient ferocious beasts, unlocking the power of flesh and blood, achieving invincibility against ten thousand, and gaining the power to split mountains and move seas!”

The author of this Seven Armored Elephant Skill was clearly a fool, his writing half-vernacular, half-classical, making it laughable to read. However, this common language was easier for a child like Li Zhiming to understand.

“I painstakingly studied the essence of the Dragon Elephant, unlocking the power of flesh and blood, but human power is finite, bones cannot bear the power of the Dragon Elephant. I cultivated the Seven Armored Elephant Skill for eighty years but could not achieve perfection. The road ahead is blocked, surpassing the limits of human power.”

“However, even though I, your author, only achieved small success with the Seven Armored Elephant Skill, I am already invincible in the martial world. Unless an immortal spits out a sword, I have no opponent. If the Seven Armored Elephant Skill were to reach great success, I wonder what a sight that would be!”

Li Zhiming was momentarily entranced. The author of the Seven Armored Elephant Skill claimed that he created it because he believed human flesh and blood were too weak, and no matter how much one practiced martial arts, it would ultimately be just a minor path. Therefore, he sought to emulate the ancient Dragon Elephant. He used himself to simulate the power of the Dragon Elephant, but in the end, he discovered that human power was finite, and no matter what, the Seven Armored Elephant Skill could not reach great success.

But even so, he was invincible in the mortal world.

“Invincible in the mortal world, with no opponent except for descending immortals!” Upon thinking of the word "immortal," Li Zhiming was momentarily lost in thought. If a person were unmatched by anyone except for immortals, how terrifying would that be? (referring to the world of mortals, invincible in the martial world).

And this was merely small success with the Seven Armored Elephant Skill!

Just imagine what it would be like if it reached great success!

“But even the creator himself can’t achieve great success. Human flesh has its limits… Wait a minute!”

While reading the Seven Armored Elephant Skill and fantasizing about the prospect that even the creator couldn't achieve great success, Li Zhiming suddenly had a flash of inspiration.

What if I have [Great Things Take Time]???

[Great Things Take Time]: Ignore all difficulties, reach full proficiency, and instantly master!

Could it bypass the bottleneck of this Seven Armored Elephant Skill and directly surpass the limits of the physical body to forcefully master the Seven Armored Elephant Skill?

The thought of this startled Li Zhiming. Could it be that the person most suited to practice this thing is Han Li?
