# Chapter 96: Hundreds of Mahayana Cultivators, the Immortal King's Imitation Flying Immortal Boat

"Eight million once!"
"Eight million twice!"
"Eight million one hundred thousand!" Yang Ji suddenly called out, then glanced at Bai Bi'er.

"Since we've already signed the agreement, fellow Daoist, just bid. Our Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance will cover the pills," Bai Bi'er said with a smile.

"Eight million one hundred thousand," the presiding elder chuckled.

"Hmm? Interesting." Inside a private VIP room, a young man chuckled lightly, then casually said, "Nine million."

"Nine million one hundred thousand," Yang Ji continued, couldn't help but curse under his breath. *How could this guy raise the price so much at once? It's practically breaking the bank.*

"Ten million," the young man chuckled again.

"Ten million one hundred thousand," Yang Ji followed suit.

"Eleven million." The young man gazed at the wooden amber on the stage, suddenly frowning.

"Eleven million one hundred thousand," Yang Ji continued.

Ten breaths later, the young man did not bid again.

"Eleven million one hundred thousand! Once," the elder chuckled.

"Honored Master, why aren't you bidding anymore?" a middle-aged man behind the young man suddenly whispered.

"I suddenly feel this item isn't worth it anymore." The young man frowned, staring at the wooden amber, a sudden intuition telling him so.

"Not worth it?" The middle-aged man was surprised.

"Eleven million one hundred thousand! Twice."
"Eleven million one hundred thousand! Thrice."
"The final price for this treasure is eleven million one hundred thousand," the elder announced with a smile.

"After the auction concludes, this item will be delivered to your private room. Please wait patiently, fellow Daoist," Bai Bi'er said.

"I truly thank you for this," Yang Ji said, cupping his fist.

"It's merely a small effort. We each get what we need," Bai Bi'er replied with a smile.

"By the way, what task does your esteemed merchant alliance want me to perform?" Yang Ji suddenly asked.

"I'm not aware of the specifics yet. Of course, for our alliance to maximize its interests, we likely won't require your assistance until you reach the Integration Stage. Whatever task it might be, it would be hundreds of years from now," Bai Bi'er explained.

Hundreds of years from now was indeed too distant, which put Yang Ji's mind somewhat at ease.

Having acquired the fragments of the Primordial Divine Tree this time, he was in high spirits and felt relaxed. He leisurely sipped immortal spiritual tea, calmly observing the bustling auction continue.

Subsequently, various rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures appeared one after another: for instance, the low-grade Dao Artifact Profound Emperor Blade, the Nine-Leaf Immortal Grass capable of increasing lifespan, the Sky-Listening Stone with enlightenment-inducing effects, and the Third-Grade Immortal Lotus that could boost cultivation, among others.

Moreover, there were even demon beast cubs for sale – specifically, a five-clawed golden dragon cub! At just one year old, it naturally exuded draconic might, roaring lowly and thrashing within the formation on the stone platform. Within a three-zhang radius, winds gathered, clouds swirled, rain poured, and lightning flashed, creating a myriad of strange phenomena.

Such a cub was extraordinary. The Dragon Race was a formidable clan, holding sway over an entire realm and incredibly protective of their own. There was a fear that if the Dragon Realm's mighty experts learned of this, they would lead an army to exact revenge, which would be a huge problem. However, there were those with courage. A mysterious Mahayana cultivator bought it with a smile.

Besides, there was also a Fire God Bird egg, entirely crimson, from which waves of extraordinary fluctuations emanated. It was ultimately purchased by an Integration Stage grand cultivator. All sorts of rare treasures, exotic beasts, sacred medicines, spiritual pills, magical artifacts, and more emerged endlessly, leaving Yang Ji dazzled and truly broadening his horizons.

The next item to be auctioned, a Flying Immortal Boat, truly ignited the entire venue. Although this boat was only a mid-grade Dao Artifact, it possessed the ability to traverse myriad realms, traveling through the void. According to the introduction, this boat was an imitation of an Immortal King's Natal Magical Treasure, the Flying Immortal Boat, from the Immortal Realm. For such a Dao Artifact, the importance of its crafting method surpassed the artifact itself. Though it was mid-grade, the power it unleashed and the profound mysteries it contained rivaled even high-grade Dao Artifacts.

The moment this item appeared, it immediately drew out countless previously hidden Mahayana cultivators who fiercely vied for it. The price was once bid up to two billion. Even Yang Ji, merely an observer, could feel the madness. Anything related to an Immortal King invariably involved immense karma and great fortune. What everyone valued was not just the Dao Artifact itself, but more so the destiny and karma hidden within it.

Witnessing hundreds of Mahayana cultivators suddenly reveal themselves, Yang Ji, who was in the same private room, couldn't help but quicken his breathing. With so many experts gathered, this was clearly no ordinary auction. Only after asking Bai Bi'er did he learn that they had meticulously prepared this auction for five hundred years. During the preparation period, they would send out messages about the auctioned items, attracting cultivators not only from the Primordial World but also from other major realms. Auctions of this scale typically occurred once every few centuries in each major realm; this time, it was simply the Primordial World's turn.

Yang Ji couldn't help but sigh in his heart, thinking that others were already traveling the world, enjoying a carefree life, while he was still preparing to pass assessments and strive to remain in the Dao Sect. This auction had broadened his horizons; his mind now extended to the myriad realms. He silently vowed that one day, he too would enjoy a true cultivation life, just like these Mahayana cultivators.

Just as he was lost in thought, the Flying Immortal Boat was bought by a Tribulation Immortal. Such a figure was so powerful that they disregarded the auction house's rules. They waved countless pills towards the central stone platform, grabbed the Flying Immortal Boat, and tore through the air, departing. At the same time, Yang Ji saw that the information displays of several other Tribulation Immortals indicated they were following closely behind.

A precious treasure was a hot potato; who knew what would happen next? It would surely be earth-shattering.

The elder presiding over the auction was not angered by the Tribulation Immortal's actions. With a single sweep of his hand, he collected the vast quantity of pills and continued: "The next auctioned item is called the Mountain Sea Pearl. It is a treasure naturally formed by heaven and earth, containing its own self-contained mountain and sea world where living beings can reside as if in the outside world. The starting bid is one million, with each increment being one hundred thousand."

"A Mountain Sea Pearl with its own world? Soul Transformation cultivators can already condense world prototypes, which are no different from a mountain and sea world, except they can't accommodate living beings. So, buying this would be pointless. As for Mahayana cultivators, their internal worlds are complete and can already accommodate living beings, so they would disdain this Mountain Sea Pearl even more," a cultivator said, shaking his head.

"You can't say that," another cultivator called out. "How many people can reach the Mahayana Stage? The Mountain Sea Pearl still has great use. I bid one million one hundred thousand."

Gazing at the Mountain Sea Pearl, Yang Ji's mind immediately stirred. If he bought it, the Primordial Divine Tree, once it sprouted, could be planted inside. Furthermore, the Buddha Child wouldn't have to constantly reside within his sleeve; he could live and cultivate inside the Mountain Sea Pearl. Similarly, this Mountain Sea Pearl was also a mobile immortal cave, excellent for storing treasures, with extremely wide-ranging benefits.

Yang Ji immediately looked at Bai Bi'er beside him. Since he had already borrowed once, he steeled his heart and prepared to borrow again. If the Primordial Divine Tree truly sprouted and grew, bearing spiritual qi fruits and Dao qi fruits, why would he worry about not being able to repay this small sum? The strong borrowed money from banks; only the weak deposited money into banks. He was moving closer to being strong.

Seeing Yang Ji's gaze, Bai Bi'er immediately understood and smiled, "What? Fellow Daoist has taken a fancy to this Mountain Sea Pearl again?"

"Yes. I wonder if I could borrow a bit more?" Yang Ji said, his heart pounding.

"You may," Bai Bi'er replied readily. "Fellow Daoist, feel free to bid. The pills will be covered by our Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance."

"There are no other additional conditions, right?" Yang Ji asked cautiously. If there was another condition, he would probably have to reconsider.

"It will be included in the previous condition," Bai Bi'er said with a smile.

"Thank you, fellow Daoist." Hearing this, Yang Ji was truly grateful. The Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance's audacity truly opened his eyes.
