# Chapter 643: The War Begins

It gave Xu Yunfan one last furious glare. Surging with ice-blue divine power and enveloped by the howling blizzard, it transformed into a wretched streak of light, fleeing deep into the ice plains toward the territory of its patron, the High God of Gale, Buthus.

Watching Lokan disappear into the ice storm at the horizon, the cold curve at the corner of Xu Yunfan’s lips finally unfurled completely, turning into a profound smile.

He slowly retracted his Martial Dao Dharma Form Golden Body, returning to his ordinary appearance as Tatos.

"Calling for backup? Very good. It suits my plans perfectly."

He muttered softly. With a slight movement of his divine sense, an extremely obscure, almost imperceptible mark of causality, like maggots clinging to bone, attached itself to the splattered divine blood from Lokan’s escape. It moved silently, connecting to an unknown distance.

This was the true use of the Heavenly Erosion Inscription.

Tracing the source through causality, all he had to do was wait for the big fish to bite.

When the time came, he would have Lokman step out. When High Gods fought, wouldn't these Mid Gods, as subordinates, have to exert some effort?

Wouldn't the Star Spirit Banner then gain more Banner Spirits, allowing him to obtain more Immortal Golden Nature?

Xu Yunfan gently stroked the banner pole hidden in his sleeve, his gaze fixed on the direction where Lokan had vanished.

He would wait here quietly.

If he left, the target wouldn't be able to find him, and all his efforts would be for nothing.

Soon, above the blizzard-swept ice plains, space suddenly twisted.

Violent air currents tore through the thick, lead-colored clouds. A cyan divine light, carrying endless wind blades and sharp howling sounds, descended violently. Its pressure was far superior to that of the Mid God, Lokan.

The High God of Gale, Buthus, who ruled the endless strong winds of the Northern Plains, materialized within the light.

His figure was slender, surrounded by flowing cyan brilliance, as if carved from flowing storms. His eyes were as cold as the polar winds, locking tightly onto Xu Yunfan, who had returned to his ordinary Tatos form within the canyon.

"Tatos!"

Buthus's voice sounded like the friction of billions of wind blades, stirring up endless gales.

"You dare to severely injure my subordinate, Lokan? Do you think the Gale God System has no one left?"

Almost as soon as Buthus finished speaking, another vast, cold will swept over, freezing the raging winds into fine ice crystals.

Deep blue steps of profound ice extended from the void, and the figure of the Winter God, Lokman, stepped forth on the ice.

His face, shrouded in hazy ice mist, was unreadable, but the undeniable aura of the Northern Plains' master made even Buthus's momentum falter.

"Buthus."

Lokman's voice was like the collision of ancient glaciers, cold and steady. "When did it become your turn to question my subordinate in my territory?"

Xu Yunfan, standing to the side, couldn't help but scratch his ears. Whether speaking or moving, these gods always had to add a bit of heavenly might, as if that was the only way to show their dignity.

Lokman deliberately emphasized the words "my territory," and the invisible Winter Law network trembled accordingly, showcasing his absolute control over the Northern Plains.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with a dark light. He touched the Star Spirit Banner, confirming that the Erosion Heaven Restriction was operating perfectly, forcing Lokman to act according to his script.

Everything was proceeding as planned.

Buthus flared with cyan light. Wind pressure and cold currents collided violently in the void, emitting a terrifying hiss.

"Lokman, Tatos crossed the line first and injured my subordinate afterward. What do you have to say? Do you want to declare war on my Gale God System for him?!"

Buthus's accusation carried the anger of a High God. He was confident that Lokman would, as in the countless border conflicts before, ultimately choose restraint and compromise.

Lokman fell silent for a moment.

His face beneath the ice mist seemed to twitch slightly.

He knew better than Buthus that once he made a move, there would be no room for maneuver.

But the fatal Erosion Heaven Restriction deep within his soul origin was like a sword hanging over his head, transmitting Xu Yunfan's irresistible command.

Retreat meant death.

Perhaps there was a sliver of life if he didn't retreat.

"God War?"

Lokman's voice suddenly rose, colder than the harshest wind in the Northern Plains, filled with the humiliation of being coerced and the rising violence that followed.

"Buthus, stop your hypocritical talk. If your dog stretched its claws over the line, it should have the觉悟 to have them chopped off! Since you can't discipline it properly, then I shall do it for you!"

Buthus's face changed drastically, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"Lokman! Are you crazy?! For such a trivial matter, you want to start a war between the two God Systems?!"

He never expected the other party to be so resolute.

Xu Yunfan sneered inwardly.

Again with the "starting a God War."

Did they buy that phrase wholesale from the Heavenly Dao?

Is it never going to end?

While cursing in his heart, he appropriately showed a mix of awe for his main god and indignation at being wronged.

"Trivial matter?"

Lokman sneered, his laughter carrying a sense of desperate madness.

He raised his hand abruptly. The invisible Frost Laws instantly connected to the depths of the Eternal Frost Court.

"Subjects of the Eternal Frost Court, heed my command! The Gale God System has invaded my territory and injured my subordinate! This is a declaration of war!"

Rumble!

From the direction of the Eternal Frost Court, ice-blue divine light shot up into the sky. Countless projections of Frost Giants, Ice Elves, and Snowfield Barbarian warriors of various forms appeared in the blizzard, letting out earth-shattering roars.

The auras of over a dozen Mid and Low Gods belonging to the Winter God System, under the command of the High God, erupted without restraint. They transformed into streaks of light, carrying their respective legions of believers, tearing through the snow and wind, and marched boldly toward the territory of the Buthus God System.

The boss had spoken; as subordinates, they naturally had to wave their flags and add to the momentum.

The roar of crystal war chariots crushing the frozen earth, the synchronized shrieks of elemental elves, and the collision of divine wills instantly turned the entire ice plain into a boiling furnace of war.

Watching Lokman truly launch a full-scale war without regard for consequences, Buthus's face,凝聚 by wind, twisted completely.

An immense sense of frustration and anger almost set him ablaze.

He couldn't understand why Lokman had suddenly become so疯狂 and reckless.

But matters had come to this point. If he backed down, his subordinates would surely lose faith, and the dignity of the Gale God System would be wiped out. In the maintenance of a God System, face was sometimes more important than interest.

"Good, very good, Lokman!"

Buthus's furious roar shook the heavens. "Since you are determined to seek death, then I shall grant your wish. Prepare for battle!"

Behind him, the cyan storm vortex expanded rapidly. Countless wind element elves, barbarian cavalry riding the gales, and the figures of Mid and Low Gods dependent on him appeared one after another. The sharp howling of wind blades cutting through the air rang out across the sky.

Two torrents representing the opposing natural powers of the Northern Plains, like two moving glaciers and storms, crashed into each other violently.

A true God System war had erupted.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan was ecstatic, almost laughing out loud.

Success!

This was the perfect scenario he had painstakingly waited for.

He blurred, merging silently into the edge of the chaotic battlefield, his aura perfectly concealed beneath the thunderous divine fluctuations of Tatos.

(Happy National Day to everyone. This arc will end soon.)
