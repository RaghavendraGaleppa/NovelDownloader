# Chapter 43: Winds Uniting the Six Directions, Cohesion Across the Nine Provinces  

The melodious strains of a zither drifted through the Hall of Supreme Harmony.  

The Empress brushed aside a stray lock of hair from her forehead, her luminous eyes fixed intently on Dou Changsheng. After a long silence, she finally spoke slowly, "The Great Jin possesses the wealth of all under heaven."  

"Yet for a moment, I find myself at a loss to determine what would best suit you."  

"What counsel does the Prince of Yan offer?"  

Yu Yun drained his wine cup in one gulp, set it down calmly, and replied, "Your Majesty already knows the answer in your heart."  

"This humble subject dares not presume to speak out of turn."  

"But if Your Majesty insists on my candid opinion..."  

"Then I cannot remain silent."  

"Our Great Jin has stood for centuries—repelling the northern barbarians, crushing the Chen Dynasty in the south. Our national strength is unmatched, making us the foremost among the four kingdoms."  

"Yet in recent years, peace in Liang has bred complacency, martial spirit has waned, and reform can no longer be delayed."  

"It is time for Liang to feel the biting northern winds."  

"Let Dou Changsheng lead northern officials into Liang to govern."  

Before Yu Yun could finish, the Empress interrupted, "The Grand General's intentions are noble, but overly simplistic."  

"Liang has always harbored resentment toward the north. Sudden, drastic measures will only provoke greater hostility. This must be approached gradually, like boiling a frog in warm water."  

Yu Yun sighed. "The Wolf Lord of the grasslands is a prodigy of his generation."  

"Now, with ample provisions and a formidable army, his wings have fully spread."  

"With hundreds of thousands of iron cavalry, aided by the Great Sage of the Polar Regions and the Grand Shaman of the Shamanic Sect—both ranked among the top ten martial masters on the Earthly Rankings—he will surely march south."  

"Great Jin has little time left. We must now administer strong medicine."  

"Without uniting all forces, Great Jin will surely fall."  

Pausing briefly, Yu Yun continued, "I once ventured beyond the frontier six times, deep into the grasslands, seeking to slay this Wolf Lord before his power matured."  

"But he always evaded me. Only after conquering the northern tribes and personally inviting the Great Sage into his court did he dare lead his army south—when we finally met face to face."  

"By then, I knew I was no longer his match."  

"This Wolf Lord is ruthless and cruel, but his greatest strength lies in his patience."  

"He never strikes without absolute certainty of victory."  

"Every battle is timed for when his enemy shows weakness—only then does he launch a decisive assault to crush them."  

"When the Wolf Lord marches, it will be because he believes he can topple Great Jin and seize the Central Plains."  

"The only reason I tolerate Your Majesty is because the Wolf Lord's threat extends beyond the north—beyond Great Jin—to the entire realm of Shenzhou."  

---  

"The strength of Great Jin alone is no longer enough to oppose him. I must journey to Western Qin and Eastern Qi, rallying the three kingdoms to break the barbarian tide and shatter the grasslands' unity, rendering them a scattered, impotent force."  

The zither's melody ceased abruptly. Chen Qingyao, who had remained silent until now, turned to Yu Yun and shook his head. "The logic is sound."  

"Western Qin and Eastern Qi are not lacking in wise men—they see it too."  

"But the Grand General's mission will be in vain."  

"Until the blade hangs over their heads, they will not feel the pain."  

"Great Jin borders the barbarians directly. When they march south, we bear the brunt."  

"Western Qin and Eastern Qi, rather than aiding us as fellow Hua-Xia, will gloat—perhaps even seize the opportunity to plunder."  

"The deposed emperor schemed endlessly. Even as Great Jin teetered on the brink, he sought to consolidate power, sowing discord among generals and ministers."  

"To survive this calamity, we must stand united."  

"Seeking external aid is futile, but purging corrupt officials, reforming governance, fortifying our borders, and training new armies—these we can achieve."  

Chen Qingyao's gaze shifted slowly, finally settling on Dou Changsheng. "You have rendered unparalleled service, saving Great Jin and preserving four regions, fifty-odd provinces, and countless lives."  

"You deserve a reward worthy of your deeds."  

"Three Origins Unified, Contending with Heaven."  

"To master the *Three Origins Qi Art* and ascend to the Earthly Rankings, you must cultivate at least two of its paths."  

"I possess a calligraphic work by the Three Peaks Elder."  

"The Three Peaks Elder ranks among the Heavenly Rankings. Even a single character from his brush carries his essence—studying it daily can refine your spirit, until one day, you awaken divine intent and step into the realm of grandmasters."  

"This is a treasure, once beloved by the late emperor and entrusted to me on his deathbed."  

"Today, I pass it to you."  

"On its reverse, I have inscribed my insights, forming a peerless technique."  

With a clap of Chen Qingyao's hands, a maidservant approached, eyes downcast, carrying the treasure with both hands. Chen Qingyao lifted it solemnly and unfurled it before Dou Changsheng.  

A scroll bearing just two characters:  

**Loyalty to the Sovereign.**  

The strokes were bold and vigorous, like a dragon in flight.  

Dou Changsheng knew little of calligraphy, but the first character sent a chill through his heart.  

This was a trap.  

The *Three Origins Qi Art* cultivated three paths: Love, Loyalty, and Valor.  

Had it been "Valor," it would have resonated with him. Even "Love" would have been acceptable. But "Loyalty"?  

The intent was unmistakable.  

Dou Changsheng fell silent. He nearly blurted out, *Can I exchange this?*  

But he knew the answer.  

With both hands, he accepted the scroll, bowed, and took his leave.  

This was no place to linger.  

A max-level expert bullying a novice—who could endure that?  

Chen Qingyao watched Dou Changsheng depart, his figure vanishing beyond the hall. Dismissing the maidservant with a wave, he turned to Yu Yun and the Empress.  

"Whether it's Dou Changsheng or Wang Tianhe..."  

"Neither lacks this character."  

"Yet it is indispensable for mastering the *Three Origins Qi Art*."  

"Sooner or later, they will study this scroll."  

"The Wang Clan of Xiangzhou has stood unshaken for a thousand years—not because they are flawless, but precisely because their fatal weakness makes them non-threatening to rulers. Thus, every dynasty tolerates them."  

"As long as they do not rebel, no crime is too great."  

This was an open scheme, flawless in its execution.  

Unless Wang Tianhe abandoned all ambition to advance further—which was impossible, given his rank as ninth on the Earthly Rankings—he would inevitably pursue this path.  

"A single scroll—unstoppable for the great king, the same for the lesser, and Dou Changsheng is no exception."  

"The Pacification Colonel must be promoted and ennobled."  

"The northern affairs still require the Grand General's personal oversight."  

"Quell the unrest swiftly, consolidate northern forces, repel the barbarians, and guard against opportunism from Western Qin and Eastern Qi upon Your Majesty's ascension."  

"Though the deposed emperor's removal caused little upheaval, it has shaken Great Jin's prestige."  

"Of two evils, we chose the lesser."  

Yu Yun rose abruptly and strode toward the exit, his parting words laced with displeasure. "The deed is done. There's no need for pretenses now."  

"And the Prince of Northern Yang must not die."  

"He is the late emperor's sole bloodline."  

"Let not the ancestral sacrifices go unattended."  

The Empress declared solemnly, "The title of Prince of Northern Yang shall remain hereditary for as long as Great Jin endures."  

"Moreover..."  

"My goal is this:"  

"**Winds Uniting the Six Directions, Cohesion Across the Nine Provinces!**"  

"When the work is complete, I shall restore the throne to the line of my imperial brother, enthroning the Prince of Northern Yang's heir!"  

"I swear this openly—should I break this vow, may the realm rise against me!"  

"I beseech the Grand General to aid me in this endeavor!"  

"To achieve true unification!"
