# Chapter 120: A Colossal Immortal Fortune

Qin Ming stood on the sun-drenched slope, looking at the edge of the giant pit above. He sighed, "As an old friend, I've truly done my best. Whether you can grasp this colossal immortal fortune or not, it's all up to you now."

Zheng Maoze had never felt such torment. The sect-suppressing artifact from a thousand years ago was right before his eyes—an ancient treasure he had yearned for in his dreams, one that could bring him near immortality! Yet, if he reached out to seize it, he would likely become the target of everyone's attacks.

Mysterious runes were engraved on the furnace body, shining brightly, its dazzling divine radiance reflecting on his face. The immortal mist rising from the furnace mouth carried a faint medicinal fragrance, already drifting to his nose and mouth. How could he resist this? It swayed his heart with temptation. The most crucial thing was that it was within arm's reach! That was a near-immortal object, capable of absorbing "Heavenly Essence" from beyond the night sky daily. Consuming it regularly could purify one's body, reform one's innate bone structure, and enhance one's spiritual consciousness.

Zheng Maoze yearned for it immensely, yet he feared being ambushed by everyone. He was currently injured and wouldn't be fast enough to escape with the Eight Trigrams Furnace. A mere instant felt like a decade of torment to his mind. He was drenched in sweat, his body trembling slightly. Who wouldn't want to become a near-immortal being? This might be the greatest opportunity of his life!

Zheng Maoze reached out and touched the furnace body, covered in immortal patterns, feeling an immense satisfaction. With a *thud*, blood burst from his back, two of his bones shattered.

"I'm not trying to snatch it, just touching it!" Zheng Maoze yelled. At the last moment, he used great resolve to sever his greed, suppressing the restless fire in his heart. He merely wanted to briefly lay his hands on it so that when he looked back on this moment in the future, he wouldn't have too many regrets; at the very least, he would have touched a near-immortal object! He thought that a momentary possession wouldn't cause trouble, but in a flash, someone delivered a killing blow to him. Several fellow disciples had been lying in wait nearby, some emerging from behind blue stones, others crawling out of ground fissures.

"Zeng Yuan, this colossal immortal fortune is yours!" Zheng Maoze spat out a mouthful of bloody foam and hurled the Eight Trigrams Furnace, throwing it towards someone he was quite close to. He wasn't trying to help this family friend; he was entirely enraged because among those who appeared from behind him was this very friend. Although Zeng Yuan hadn't yet attacked, he had already drawn a spiritual blade forged from lightning-struck wood.

Zeng Yuan looked bewildered. The furnace, swirling with immortal light, landed in his hands. It felt like a dream—what he had longed for had materialized into reality? His lips trembled. Then, he turned and ran with the furnace!

Zheng Maoze let out a sigh of relief, his body drenched in sweat, but at least he had escaped a deadly situation. The moment he touched the Eight Trigrams Furnace, a bloody hole appeared on his back. A moment later, he might have been blown apart. He was filled with intense hatred; not a single person had considered their fellow disciple's camaraderie, acting viciously and ruthlessly. Then, a sense of loss washed over him. If he hadn't broken eighteen bones, he would have definitely taken the furnace and fled; there would have been a great chance of success!

"Who was so generous as to throw the Eight Trigrams Furnace to me?" He had only caught a fleeting glimpse earlier. Now, looking downwards, he saw a hazy yet familiar figure waving at him and nodding in greeting.

"Damn it..." Zheng Maoze's body swayed violently. Wasn't that the Six Imperial Lineage successor who had hammered and broken dozens of his bones? He gritted his teeth, his face livid. That guy knew his physical condition, which was why he had sent such a "grand gift" to him!

"Zheng Dazhuang, don't say I don't care about our old friendship. This wave of fortune was yours to grasp, but you missed it." Qin Ming shook his head with a light sigh, no longer looking at him.

Zeng Yuan, covered in blood and staggering, was in even greater pain than Zheng Maoze, for he had held the Eight Trigrams Furnace longer and suffered double the attacks. He lacked the necessary strength to protect a near-immortal object and couldn't even run as fast as others. If not for the widespread knowledge that he was very close to Li Qingxu, he would probably be in an even worse state.

"Zeng Yuan, over here!" Wang Caiwei waved at him, bringing her people rapidly closer. At the critical moment, Zeng Yuan used all his strength to throw the Eight Trigrams Furnace into the giant pit, because he saw Li Qingxu's figure. He was very pragmatic; even if he had to give it away, he would give it to a core disciple.

Wang Caiwei, who always wore a sweet smile, had her expression freeze instantly. For a moment, her body expanded with terrifying spiritual consciousness. Zeng Yuan felt suspicious. Was he hallucinating after being severely injured? He vaguely heard Wang Caiwei create a sonic boom as she furiously swung her fist.

Undoubtedly, a fierce battle erupted in the giant pit. Several core disciples began an all-out brawl. Now, wherever the Eight Trigrams Furnace landed, it would ignite a bloody conflict. Other disciples dared not participate, deeply sensing that the gap between them and the core disciples was simply too vast.

Tang Xumi, Jiang Shengyu, Hu Tingwen, Su Jingzhu, and Li Qingxu—the five core disciples engaged in a fierce melee. They knew clearly that others posed no threat to them; only these five were true competitors, and they had reached the final stage. On the slope, their bodies were covered in pure yang blood, radiating dazzling golden light. As they fought, the edge of the deep pit collapsed, massive boulders rolled down, causing immense destruction.

Luo Qingge and Sun Jingting were already out. They had been severely wounded earlier while dealing with Cui Chonghe, who had possessed another person. However, the core disciples had not publicized this; others still did not know that Cui Chonghe had entered the fray. Apparently, this small group had reached some secret agreements with Cui Chonghe while expelling him, keeping it unannounced.

*Boom!* Like thunder exploding, the conscious lights of the five supreme experts collided, tearing at the side walls of the giant pit. Millstone-sized rocks fell densely, resembling a mountain flash flood. They dared to use their spiritual consciousness in the area of thin heavenly light, making the battle increasingly fierce.

Qin Ming's brows were deeply furrowed. The strength of the core disciples was terrifying, far exceeding his imagination. The arrow he shot at Li Qingxu was proof enough. It was an arrowhead forged from gleaming blue jade-iron, a rare and precious material of the same grade as his Mutton-Fat Jade-Iron Saber, carrying his terrifying heavenly light, fused into one. An arrow shot with such power only tore open the flesh on Li Qingxu's palm, without even harming the bone. This alone proved Li Qingxu's profound cultivation. For anyone else, Qin Ming's special arrow would likely have caused their body to explode; conservatively speaking, an arm or hand would have been shattered.

"The path of the Outsiders indeed has no shortcomings. First, spiritual consciousness is born, and then in later cultivation, extraordinary power nourishes the body, greatly enhancing the physique, leaving no flaws." Qin Ming pondered. No wonder Outsiders were so self-important, constantly talking about the distinction between immortals and mortals, believing their path to be more profound—a golden path. Qin Ming felt no sense of defeat. His realm was still low; he had only just undergone his sixth rebirth. Only when he truly stepped into the Outer Saint realm and compared himself to the core disciples of the Outsider lands would he know who was weaker and who was stronger.

He walked up the slope to a shattered area where the five core disciples had fought. There, he found his crystal-clear blue jade-iron arrow. After being wounded, Li Qingxu quickly engaged with the other core disciples and hadn't paid attention to the arrow. It lay here, stained with blood, abandoned. In the past two years, Qin Ming had suffered hunger and cold in Black White Mountain, developing a habit of frugality. Naturally, he intended to retrieve such a precious arrow.

In the distance, Li Qingxu, engrossed in battle, sensed something. His eyes, like two bolts of lightning, coldly glanced in Qin Ming's direction, as if to remember him. At the edge of the giant pit, many Outsider disciples looked down, revealing surprised expressions. They marveled at this Outer Saint, truly a formidable individual, who dared to attempt to kill Li Qingxu and actually succeeded in wounding him.

Among the five core disciples, Jiang Shengyu gradually faltered. He, along with Tang Xumi and Su Jingzhu, had once besieged Li Qingyue, suffering severe injuries, and now he could no longer hold on. Soon, he coughed up large mouthfuls of blood, his spiritual consciousness dimming. He was about to become the first core disciple to be eliminated among the five. Jiang Shengyu immediately fled. If he didn't leave now, he might be killed on the spot. At this point, there was no talk of close friendship or fellow disciple camaraderie among them. Even if they were once as close as brothers, now their eyes were red with killing intent, solely for the Eight Trigrams Furnace, to drink "Heavenly Essence" daily, thereby enhancing their bodies and spiritual consciousness, and eventually reaching near immortality!

Li Qingxu coughed up a mouthful of blood; his condition also seemed problematic. He voluntarily withdrew but also blocked Su Jingzhu, who was similarly injured. "Hu Tingwen, you owe me a favor. This time, I'll help you block one!" Li Qingxu said. He indicated that he couldn't fight fiercely anymore but could block the somewhat weakened Su Jingzhu.

"Alright, many thanks, Brother Li!" Hu Tingwen nodded, then went all out against Tang Xumi. The final contest would unfold between these two.

Tang Xumi's mouth twitched. Earlier, he and Li Qingyue had pursued Li Qingxu, but they failed to completely drive him away, which ultimately led to negative consequences. In fact, though Li Qingxu was somewhat wounded, he still had the strength to fight. However, he knew that Li Qingyue was secretly hidden and had not yet revealed herself. He had always wanted Li Qingyue to fight it out with Tang Xumi and Hu Tingwen, but he could never discover Li Qingyue's true location. He felt no obligation to warn others, mainly because he worried that if he provoked Li Qingyue into showing herself, she would specifically try to kill him. He thought it better to keep Li Qingyue calm for now, because once he got his hands on the near-immortal object, even if Li Qingyue appeared, it would be too late.

Li Qingxu still had a trump card: a profound escape art his teacher had taught him. As long as he was willing to consume his origin energy, even someone who had just stepped into the Third Grand Realm might not be able to catch him. However, in that state, he could only flee, not fight. What he hoped for most now was to maintain calm. As long as he could grasp the Eight Trigrams Furnace, everything would be decided! He was secretly furious; there had been two excellent opportunities where he was about to obtain the near-immortal object. Once, his palm was shot and injured, and the second time, when Zeng Yuan threw it to him, it was blocked by Tang Xumi. Now, the Eight Trigrams Furnace was temporarily in Tang Xumi's hands.

After Li Qingxu forced Su Jingzhu back, the two opened up enough distance and temporarily ceased fighting. "Tang Xumi, I have high hopes for you. You should be able to defeat Hu Tingwen." Li Qingxu whispered this while panting heavily, actually hoping for Hu Tingwen's defeat. At the same time, he was quite nervous, most afraid that Li Qingyue would "lose her composure" and show herself now.

Moments later, the edge of the giant pit collapsed significantly. It had to be said that both Tang Xumi and Hu Tingwen were very strong. Their spiritual consciousness was like heavenly blades slashing, and the divine radiance from their Huangting boiled, seemingly twisting space. Large, millstone-sized rocks crashed down from the rock walls like a heaven-shaking waterfall, plunging into the pit's depths.

Hu Tingwen coughed up large mouthfuls of blood. He was no match for Tang Xumi, staggering backward, his face full of bitterness. The near-immortal object, so close to him, just one more opponent to defeat to obtain it. He had timed his entry into the Luofu Mountain ruins perfectly to avoid some competitors, yet he never expected to fail at Tang Xumi's hurdle in the end.

"Do any of you wish to fight further?" Tang Xumi tilted his head back and drank a flask of golden liquid, a spiritual medicine that rapidly restored his exhausted body. The main reason was that he had not been severely wounded, so minor injuries and exhaustion were nothing to him. His loyal disciples and golden-armored guards stepped forward, standing with their backs to him, facing Li Qingxu, Hu Tingwen, and the others.

"Since my fellow disciples no longer wish to challenge, let us conclude this now!" Tang Xumi announced, preparing to leave surrounded by his retinue.

*Bang!* One of the golden-armored guards behind Tang Xumi suddenly struck him with a palm, making him cough up large mouthfuls of blood. This guard was incredibly powerful. His left hand manifested terrifying black light, while his right hand bloomed with intense white heavenly light. Not only did he injure Tang Xumi, but he also swept away the Eight Trigrams Furnace with his heavenly light. Furthermore, he immediately flew away without any delay.

"It's the world-renowned Yin-Yang Black-White Art? You're from the Yin-Yang Temple! I never imagined such an expert was by my side!" Tang Xumi's face turned icy cold. The incident was too sudden, exceeding everyone's expectations.

The expert from the Yin-Yang Temple, who cultivated an incredibly special and powerful Heavenly Light Art, had just burst forth with black and white light from his left and right hands, sweeping the Eight Trigrams Furnace. His target, surprisingly, was Li Qingxu! No one had anticipated such a turn of events, and there was no time to stop it.

Li Qingxu's face revealed joy. He began consuming his origin energy, preparing to flee. He reached out to catch the Eight Trigrams Furnace, which was falling and about to come into his possession.

*Clang! Clang!* Two metallic vibrations rang out almost simultaneously. An iron arrow struck the Eight Trigrams Furnace, sending sparks flying, and a rock also hit the furnace body with immense force, shattering the rock into dust. Clearly, these two strikes completely altered the Eight Trigrams Furnace's trajectory.

Li Qingxu was uncontrollably furious. Just a little more, and he would have received the Eight Trigrams Furnace! But now it had deviated from its path, landing in the hands of an elite disciple, who then casually threw it back to Tang Xumi.

Qin Ming put away his bow. He had been observing the battlefield, staring at Li Qingxu, Tang Xumi, and the others. He possessed the Five Ultimate Arts of Saber, Spear, Hammer, Arrow, and Lance, and he had just demonstrated one of them. The rock came from a graceful golden-armored guard—it was Li Qingyue, who now walked from a distance, no longer hiding her true form.
