# Chapter 176: The Dharma Protector Goes Mad

Golden mist swirled across a hundred-mile radius, undulating like water ripples as it painted the entire world in gold. 

This was the accumulated faith power gathered over centuries from the Great Song Dynasty, collected by remnants of the Black Lotus Sect's native faction across six regions. As the three demonic sects launched their expedition, all this had been offered to the Dharma Protector.

Now, this vast reservoir of faith power was being burned as fuel, sacrificed entirely to summon the legendary "World Honored One."

Not only was the Dharma Protector heartbroken over the loss, even Lin Shan watching from afar felt his breath catch. 

How much faith power was this? Converted to ancient essence, how many points would it be worth?

He recalled the Night Wolf Ancient Tomb—where all the antiques plus that massive Black Lotus Buddha statue had provided a total of 50 ancient essence points. And that was just the faith power gathered from one region: the eighteen counties of the Southern Border's five provinces.

Yet according to the Dharma Protector, what had just been burned was the accumulated faith from six entire regions. Converted to ancient essence, this was likely close to 300 points!

What an astronomical fortune!

If Lin Shan had obtained it, he could have enhanced four or five spirit treasures, upgrading his entire arsenal to top-tier equipment. 

This was true overnight wealth!

Compared to this, the meager gains from his missionary work in the East Sea were like comparing watermelons to sesame seeds. The entire East Sea's population couldn't match the Southern Border's. The Black Lotus remnants had secretly gathered faith for nearly a millennium to accumulate those 50 points, while Lin Shan's twenty years of missionary work in the East Sea's虾夷海域 likely hadn't even yielded a single point—hardly worth the immense risk of skimming off the top.

How many years would it take to see returns from his own missionary efforts? Slow, tedious accumulation paled in comparison to outright plunder.

It seemed that in the future, targeting sects like the Black Lotus or Joyful Teachings would be the proper way to utilize his golden finger.

What pained him was seeing the Great Song's thousand-year accumulation being squandered by the Dharma Protector—an act of sheer extravagance.

Yet, the sheer might unleashed by burning this ocean of faith was undeniable—vast, overwhelming, pressing down like an abyss.

A golden gate stood tall in the sky, its radiance illuminating the earth.

First, a perfectly sculpted jade foot stepped through, followed by slender legs veiled by a verdant lotus skirt, a willowy waist, a swan-like neck, and finally, a face that blended noble coldness with pure elegance.

She resembled a lotus—unstained by mud, untainted by clear ripples. 

Standing gracefully with cascading black hair, she was the epitome of an icy, classical beauty, her ethereal aura like a painting of an immortal maiden.

This was the Black Lotus Sect's legendary "World Honored One"? 

The Black Lotus Buddha they preached about daily? 

The true mastermind behind this top-tier demonic sect?

A woman!

Of course, no one would naively assume she was just an ordinary woman. To have nurtured a demonic titan like the Dharma Protector, she must have extraordinary origins—perhaps even from the upper realms.

Lin Shan's mouth went dry. These heretical sects were indeed formidable, daring to defy the celestial decrees of the immortal world. They must have formidable backing.

But this woman was breathtakingly beautiful, her transcendent grace and movements harmonizing with heaven and earth. Could she be... an actual immortal?

Alas, no one would answer that. The lotus-skirted woman—the supposed "World Honored One"—appeared to be merely a summoned projection, here to fulfill the sacrificial contract and battle, devoid of independent thought or speech.

Yet her actions were swift. The moment she stepped through the gate, her delicate hand rose.

Instantly, space itself seemed gripped by its lifeline. The world cracked like a mirror under unbearable pressure. The three Violet Firmament Sect elders strained but were forced to their knees.

The celestial river hanging above, once turbulent, now calmed. Lightning-formed waves stilled as the miles-long divine technique was smoothed away. Then, to everyone's horror—

*Snap! Snap! Snap!*

It shattered into segments before exploding into fragments.

Next, the void itself seemed to come alive, bubbling like boiling water. Vision blurred, obscuring the ensuing chaos.

The power unleashed by the faith-fueled projection was unimaginable—overturning rivers and moving mountains would be child's play.

Within three breaths, the situation inside grew dire. No resistance seemed viable. Amidst the clashing of treasures and techniques, the Violet Firmament elders' desperate cries rang out:

"Great Elder, save us!"

Onlookers startled—had the Violet Firmament Sect brought reinforcements?

A purple streak shot from the west like a comet, crashing into the battlefield with a deafening explosion.

*BOOM!*

Dust billowed as the oppressive void shattered. A hoarse, aged voice echoed:

"Heaven and earth boundless, cosmos lend thy might,  
Violet Firmament bears the Dao, five thunders alight,  
Shifting dual energies, merging as one,  
Hear my call, answer swift, by divine rite!  

*HAH!*"

As the chant concluded, purple lightning flooded the land, transforming it into a sea of thunder.

*BOOM! CRACK!*

A thunderclap erupted from the earth, shaking mountains and rivers.

Gold and violet light alternated overhead as the world trembled on the brink of collapse.

Lin Shan and his group huddled low, not daring to look around lest stray lightning sense their gaze. Even their spiritual senses were tightly reined in.

His subordinates, having witnessed the Violet Firmament Sect's grand battle years prior, recognized the voice—the Violet Firmament's Great Elder, a millennium-old late-stage Nascent Soul monster.

Unlike the Dharma Protector—a mere Nascent Soul inhabiting a Golden Core body—this elder was at his peak. 

Rumored to have lived over a thousand years, two centuries past the Nascent Soul lifespan limit, he'd consumed countless longevity elixirs to uphold the Violet Firmament Sect's position as the Great Song's top orthodox sect—a true pillar of their foundation.

While the lotus-skirted projection had effortlessly crushed three elders' combined technique, the Great Elder alone shattered her spatial lockdown—a testament to the vast disparities within the Nascent Soul realm.

The battle raged indeterminably, every second stretching like eternity amidst earth-shattering cataclysms. Finally, as dust settled, silence returned.

...

Night fell, a breeze dispersing the last haze.

*Cough* *Cough* *Cough*

Dirt-covered figures emerged from the ground, helping each other up—until an odd sound interrupted.

*Crack!*

"Ow! What's wrong with you?!"

The group turned to see Old Man Zhong standing awkwardly, holding a thigh bone while Black Skeleton Demon Lord flailed upside-down with one leg still buried.

Lin Shan shot Old Man Zhong a disapproving glance—petty grudges at a time like this?

He stepped forward, grabbed the other thigh bone, and yanked.

*Crack!*

"AAAH—!"

Another scream. Everyone stared.

"Who took my second leg?! Old Zhong, was it you?!"

Lin Shan guiltily shoved the bone into Old Man Zhong's arms, directing others to dig out the skeleton.

Seeing Old Man Zhong holding both his legs, Black Skeleton fumed but couldn't stand to retaliate.

Old Man Zhong stammered, "I-I was trying to help! Who knew your joints were so brittle..."

Black Skeleton reattached his legs and berated Old Man Zhong relentlessly.

"Our bones are fragile! Couldn't you dig me out properly?"

"First one leg, then the other?!"

"You're clearly sabotaging me!"

...

Old Man Zhong flushed, waving his hands. "I didn't! The first was me, but the second—"

He glanced at Lin Shan's warning glare and trailed off.

Black Skeleton scoffed, "What, the second wasn't you? Don't tell me Brother Lin did it!"

Lin Shan's heart skipped a beat, but his loyal followers intervened.

"Impossible!"

"Absolutely not!"

"I saw it—the envoy didn't move!"

"I swear, our boss stood still the whole time! May lightning strike me if I lie—"

*CRACK!*

A stray lightning bolt obliged, leaving the man smoking but unharmed. He wobbled proudly before collapsing.

The group checked—only minor burns. The lightning had spent its power.

Black Skeleton continued his tirade while Old Man Zhong floundered, constantly interrupted by Lin Shan's loyalists.

Seizing the opportunity, Black Skeleton declared, "I'll beat this old fool half to death!"

Lin Shan intervened, "Brother, calm down. Old Zhong meant well—"

"Meant well?! He broke both my legs!"

"Perhaps... age has addled his mind?"

"Ha! This sly fox? Never! Out of my way!"

"Wait, remember our greater purpose—"

"ENOUGH with 'greater purpose'!"

Black Skeleton trembled violently, ribs rattling loose.

"Never say those words again, or we're through!"

The group held their breath as tensions peaked.

Lin Shan sighed dramatically, turning away with a meaningful wrist flick—revealing his storage bracelet.

"Very well. You've suffered greatly by my side. With enemies surrounding us, why should a free spirit like you share our doomed fate? Hide in some graveyard—decades later, emerge when this storm has passed."

"Farewell, dear friend. Though parting grieves me, all feasts must end. The moon waxes and wanes—such is life's impermanence..."

Black Skeleton gaped. Was this rascal... reciting poetry?

Wait—was he dismissing me?!

The skeleton's greed flared at the sight of the storage bracelet. Not without the先天灵宝!

For the treasure, I'll endure.

Instantly, Black Skeleton backtracked.

"Brother, what nonsense! Would I abandon comrades in danger?!"

"Honor above all! Through thick and thin!"

"For brothers, I'd take blades to the ribs!"

To demonstrate, he produced two bone knives and jammed them between his ribs—quite literally.

Lin Shan turned, feigning emotion, and clasped the skeleton's shoulders.

"Brother!"

"Brother Lin!"

The two foxes embraced tearfully, reconciliation complete.

Moved by this display of loyalty, the onlookers sniffled.

...

Post-drama, the group resumed their flight.

The battle's outcome remained unknown as they traveled east, crossing the Yimeng Mountains under clear skies.

Descending, they spotted a hundred demonic cultivators halted ahead—fellow refugees who'd also witnessed yesterday's battle.

Before they could inquire, an invisible force yanked them into the crowd.

*Thud* *Thud* *Thud*

"Ow! What now?!"

The surrounding cultivators wore bitter expressions.

At the road's center stood a red-robed youth—the Dharma Protector!

While initially thrilled to encounter a senior, their joy faded upon noticing his erratic behavior—twitching limbs, paranoid glances, and mad muttering.

The demonic titan, it seemed, had been driven insane by the faith power backlash.
