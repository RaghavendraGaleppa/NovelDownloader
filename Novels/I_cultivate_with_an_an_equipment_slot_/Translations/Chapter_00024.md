# Chapter 24: The Worn Shoe

Zhang Yan focused his gaze on the [Stone Appraisal] entry in his equipment interface. An explanation immediately appeared:

[You have achieved minor mastery in stone appraisal. Even when spiritual stones are concealed, you can still identify valuable raw stones among countless others.]

"Wait... is this..."

"Gemstone gambling?"

Zhang Yan was stunned. He never expected that even in this world of immortal cultivation, something like gemstone gambling would exist.

"Still, this stone appraisal skill is genuinely useful."

Though Zhang Yan personally despised gambling, he had to admit this ability would be extremely valuable to him. At the very least, it would significantly increase his chances of identifying raw stones containing magical artifacts during his work at Thousand Treasures Peak.

This meant not only more contribution points but also exposure to a wider variety of magical artifacts.

With this in mind, he immediately began searching for a suitable stone-chiseling tool. After examining various tools in the storage room, he finally selected a stone chisel with the right attributes.

[Equipment Name]: Stone Chisel  
[Equipment Quality]: Gray  
[Equipment Effects]: Piercing, Stone Appraisal (Intermediate), Stone Processing Experience +30%  

After equipping it, Zhang Yan grabbed another tool and headed toward the pile of raw stones. Each stone was massive, some even shaped like magical artifacts. From a distance, he spotted one resembling a flying sword, though the numerous cut marks on its surface suggested it had been examined and discarded as worthless.

The miraculous thing was that as soon as Zhang Yan looked at the stones, his mind was flooded with appraisal knowledge—instinctively telling him which stones might contain something valuable and what that might be. It felt as though he had suddenly become an innate expert, with clear reasoning accompanying each insight.

"According to my intuition, this one might yield something good." Following his newfound knowledge, Zhang Yan quickly selected a stone the size of a human head, covered in emerald-green moss. At first glance, it appeared ordinary, but attempting to scan it with spiritual sense was like trying to peer through an impenetrable veil—likely due to his current low cultivation level. A stronger cultivator might have pierced through this stone membrane.

Grasping his chisel and hammer, Zhang Yan began working on the stone. The outer layer was peculiarly hard and resistant to spiritual detection, but once chipped away, its special properties vanished entirely. Thanks to the enhanced skills from his tools, the process felt effortless, almost like the legendary butcher who could dismantle an ox with precision.

Soon, he had fully uncovered the stone's contents.

"There's something here... but it couldn't withstand the erosion of time."

Inside was a jade pendant-like artifact, but its spiritual energy had long since dissipated. With a light breath, the pendant crumbled into dust.

Though disappointing, this was the norm. If every stone yielded treasures, they wouldn't have been discarded here for him to process.

The afternoon passed quickly. In that time, Zhang Yan had processed three stones—two yielded nothing, while the third contained a mineral ore. Since the ore was useless to him, he decided to see what price the overseer would offer for it later.

Estimating he had time for one more stone, Zhang Yan resumed his search. His experience had sharpened his appraisal and processing skills. Soon, he found a square-shaped stone about a foot in size.

"I feel like there's something inside this one."

He immediately set to work. With precise strikes of his tools, he soon broke through the stone's outer layer, revealing its contents.

As the membrane fell away, a faint spiritual glow emerged.

[Equipment Name]: Lightstep Boot  
[Equipment Quality]: Blue  
[Equipment Effects]: Lightfoot Technique (Advanced), Extreme Speed, Movement Skill  

"Now that's a treasure!"

Zhang Yan couldn't help but grin. His efforts had finally paid off—he had uncovered something valuable! The only downside was... why was there only one boot?

Carrying the boot, Zhang Yan packed up, returned his tools to the storage room, and headed for the exit.

At the valley's exit, an overseer stood beside a line of disciples waiting to exchange their finds for contribution points. When it was Zhang Yan's turn, the overseer glanced at his haul.

"First time here? Not bad."  

Pointing to the mineral ore, the overseer said, "This is Starfall Iron. I'll count it as a low-grade artifact—100 contribution points. Any objections?"  

Zhang Yan shook his head.  

Then the overseer eyed the Lightstep Boot with visible distaste. He hated dealing with single footwear—paired boots were far more valuable.  

"Only 30 contribution points for this."  

Zhang Yan considered it, then asked, "What if I wanted to buy this artifact instead?"  

The overseer paused. "For you? 120 points."  

The Lightstep Boot had originally been a high-grade artifact, but time had eroded its spiritual energy, and its single status drastically reduced its value. Few cultivators wanted secondhand footwear, so the price was low.  

"120 points..."  

To Zhang Yan, however, this wasn't a major issue.  

"Deal! Though I don't have enough contribution points left. Can I make up the difference with spirit stones?"  

The overseer agreed without fuss, letting Zhang Yan take the boot.  

Clutching his "worn shoe," Zhang Yan left Thousand Treasures Peak in high spirits. Despite working all day and even losing 20 contribution points, he was thrilled.  

Rushing back to his residence, he eagerly examined his prize.  

Today had been a day of great gains!
