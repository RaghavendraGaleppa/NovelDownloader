# Chapter 26: Spirit Beast Pouch

After speaking, Huo Qiang returned to his seat, smiling as he surveyed the surrounding cultivators.

"Senior Huo, how much for that high-grade magical artifact, the Emerald Peak Blade?" someone suddenly asked.

Qin Chong followed the voice and saw a cultivator at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement, appearing to be in his thirties.

As expected, high-grade magical artifacts were mostly sought after by late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, who could fully utilize their power. Those below the mid-stage would struggle to wield them effectively.

"The high-grade magical artifact, the Emerald Peak Blade—a wood-attribute weapon—is priced at one thousand five hundred spirit stones. Any fellow Daoists interested may also make an offer," Huo Qiang announced.

"I'll add fifty spirit stones."

"Hmph, I bid one thousand six hundred," the first bidder retorted, glaring at the competitor.

"One thousand six hundred fifty!"

"One thousand seven hundred!"

After a brief bidding war, the first bidder secured the artifact for one thousand eight hundred spirit stones.

However, Qin Chong suspected the competing bidder was a plant arranged by Huo Qiang to drive up the price—though he had no proof. This suspicion only reinforced how a bad first impression could color one's perception of future events.

"I want that hundred-year-old Purple Bell Flower!"

"I'll take the Minor Five Elements Formation."

"The bottle of Qi Condensation Pills is mine."

The scene quickly grew lively as cultivators called out their bids. Watching the fervor, the Foundation Establishment cultivators couldn't hide their delight.

Within just over an hour, half the items on the table had been claimed. Gradually, the excitement waned, and the voices grew sparse.

When no further bids were made, Huo Qiang scanned the room and declared, "Since no one seems interested in the remaining items, we'll now proceed to the exchange segment. Fellow Daoists may come forward to announce what you seek or what you wish to trade. Remember—whatever is exchanged here, regardless of origin, must remain confidential. The consequences of leaks are well understood."

His message was clear: even illicit items could be traded here without fear of exposure. It was a shrewd arrangement, though whether anyone would dare trade such items remained uncertain.

At that moment, an elderly man in black robes stepped forward.

"I have a hundred-year-old Snow Lingzhi Mushroom and wish to exchange it for a Qi-Boosting Pill."

The mention of the rare mushroom immediately caught the attention of the Foundation Establishment cultivators, but their excitement dimmed upon hearing the requested Qi-Boosting Pill, their brows furrowing in contemplation.

---

Though the Qi-Boosting Pill was a Qi Refinement-level elixir, its value surpassed even many Foundation Establishment cultivation aids—because it extended one's lifespan by five years. In every cultivation realm, longevity-enhancing pills were among the rarest and most precious, second only to breakthrough-assistance elixirs.

The hall fell silent. The old man glanced around, his expression growing despondent. Just as he turned to leave, a Foundation Establishment cultivator called out, "Fellow Daoist, wait! I'll take that Snow Lingzhi."

The speaker was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, appearing slightly younger than Huo Qiang, with refined features and dressed in black robes bearing the insignia of the Canglong Valley.

"Senior Meng, do you possess a Qi-Boosting Pill?" The old man perked up instantly.

"Come forward first. Inspect this item, then decide whether to trade."

As the old man approached, the cultivator surnamed Meng erected a barrier around them, shielding their exchange from prying eyes and ears. Moments later, the barrier dissipated, and the old man returned to his seat. Judging by their expressions, the trade had succeeded.

Emboldened by this exchange, the Qi Refinement cultivators grew more active. Even the Foundation Establishment experts began requesting materials, though only two succeeded in their bids. They knew better than to ask for anything beyond the reach of Qi Refinement cultivators.

As the hours-long trading session neared its end, Qin Chong grew anxious—he still hadn't spotted the Spirit Beast Pouch he needed. With time running out, he steeled himself and stepped to the center of the hall.

The sight of a mere third-layer Qi Refinement cultivator drew mocking laughter and jeers from the crowd.

"Since when did we allow third-layer novices in here?"

"Bold move for someone so weak to show up here!"

"Planning to buy a low-grade magical artifact, little friend?"

"Low-grade? Can't even use it to fly on a sword. What's the point?"

Qin Chong's face tightened at the ridicule, but inwardly, he remained unshaken. He'd weathered worse storms than this.

"Silence!" Huo Qiang's sharp command cut through the mockery. Turning to Qin Chong, he said, "Brother Qin, state your request. Pay no heed to these fools."

Taking a steadying breath, Qin Chong announced, "I seek a Spirit Beast Pouch and am willing to pay five mid-grade spirit stones."

A Spirit Beast Pouch typically cost at least a thousand low-grade spirit stones. At standard exchange rates, five mid-grade stones equated to five hundred low-grade ones—but mid-grade stones were scarce, often trading at a premium of 110 to 120 low-grade stones each.

"Mid-grade stones?" The Meng cultivator's eyes narrowed. "How does a mere third-layer Qi Refinement cultivator possess such wealth? Have you been pilfering from the mines?"

Qin Chong quickly defended himself, "This junior would never dare! The stones can be inspected for authenticity."

"Senior Brother Meng, this is unnecessary," Huo Qiang interjected. "Nephew Qin is known to me. I vouch for his integrity."

"If Junior Brother Huo guarantees it, then so be it." Meng's tone softened slightly. "I do happen to have a spare Spirit Beast Pouch, but the offered price is rather low."

"Then let me handle this transaction," Huo Qiang said quickly.

Meng raised a hand. "Patience, Junior Brother. First come, first served. If our negotiation fails, you may step in."

To Qin Chong's surprise, the two Foundation Establishment experts were now vying over five mid-grade stones—proof of their scarcity even at higher cultivation levels. He resolved to be more cautious with such displays in the future.

Chastened, Huo Qiang fell silent with a displeased expression.

"Brother Qin, examine this pouch and see if it meets your needs." Meng tossed a gray Spirit Beast Pouch toward him.

Qin Chong caught it and probed it with his spiritual sense. The interior space was vast—nearly eight zhang in diameter, comparable to a mid-grade storage pouch.

"This is more than satisfactory," Qin Chong said, preparing to hand over the stones.

But Meng added, "However, your offer remains inadequate. Do you possess additional mid-grade stones?"
