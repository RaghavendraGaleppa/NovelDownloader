# Chapter 143: The Void Illumination Seal and the Slaying of the Serpent Demon!

The human-bodied, serpent-tailed youth shouted loudly, issuing a challenge to Gu Yuan.

But before Gu Yuan could respond, the serpent youth had already struck first.

"Swish!"

A mass of emerald-green water, like rolling mist, surged toward Gu Yuan.

This technique, called "Jade Yin Profound Water," was his innate spell, possessing extraordinary corrosive power. Even spirit artifacts forged from rare treasures would dissolve into useless waste if caught in its flow. If it touched human flesh, the victim would instantly perish, body and soul obliterated.

In an instant, the emerald tide blotted out the sky.

Gu Yuan remained unfazed. From his dantian, he summoned a translucent, jade-like seal—the Void Illumination Seal.

This seal was not part of the Qingfeng Daoist Academy’s legacy but was instead learned from the Three Methods Daoist of Yunlan Valley.

During his time in the valley, the Three Methods Daoist had left behind not only the Three Hearts Golden Seal but also seven secret techniques—four for Qi Refinement and three for Foundation Establishment.

At the time, Gu Yuan had already reached the peak of the ninth level of Qi Refinement, just a step away from Foundation Establishment. Thus, he discarded the Qi Refinement techniques and focused solely on the three Foundation Establishment secret methods.

These three techniques were the "Void Illumination Seal," the "Spirit Sense Seal of No-Mind," and the "Blazing Phoenix Sundering Sun Sword Seal."

These three secret methods were the Three Methods Daoist’s prized possessions, key to his survival through countless battles. Each held profound mysteries.

Among them was a particularly formidable sword seal.

However, in terms of potential and lethality, none could compare to the "Boundless Sword Seal" bestowed upon Gu Yuan by the Sword Fox Sage.

The Qingfeng Daoist Academy’s heritage was no weaker than the Three Methods Daoist’s—in fact, it surpassed it. While an ordinary cultivator might have been overjoyed to obtain these three techniques, for a disciple of a major sect like Gu Yuan, they were merely additional tools.

Thus, over the past year, Gu Yuan had focused on cultivating the "Boundless Sword Seal" and the "Dragon-Binding True Seal." Of the Three Methods Daoist’s techniques, he had only found time to refine the "Void Illumination Seal."

This seal was forged from the Dao patterns of the "Void Illumination Jade" of Mount Xi. Once refined, it could manifest a translucent barrier, isolating the user from external spells. As long as the cultivator’s spiritual energy remained unbroken, the barrier would hold, rendering a thousand techniques ineffective. However, it could not withstand overwhelmingly powerful, pure yang-type attacks.

Against the sinister, deceitful, but not overwhelmingly potent spells of demonic beings, it was an exceptional defensive seal.

As for the "Spirit Sense Seal of No-Mind," it was a peculiar seal that could detect hostility. Within a hundred paces, if another cultivator harbored killing intent toward the user, the seal would immediately sense it, triggering an instinctive warning. It was this seal that had allowed the Three Methods Daoist to escape danger time and again.

However, refining this seal was no easy task. It required the skull of a "Mind-Enlightening Beast" no more than seven days old as its spiritual material. This beast was a natural-born earth demon, growing into a formidable late-stage earth demon as it matured. Elusive and unpredictable, it was nearly impossible to find. Even if Gu Yuan wished to cultivate this technique, he could not, and thus had to set it aside for now.

"Pop!"

Now, as the Void Illumination Seal activated, a bubble-like barrier materialized before Gu Yuan, shielding him completely.

"Sizzle!"

The emerald tide surged forward but seemed to lose its target, unable to penetrate. It could only wash futilely against the void.

"Clang!"

Within the barrier, eighteen radiant sword beams flashed forth, sharp beyond measure, like golden lightning bolts streaking toward the serpent-tailed youth.

The youth flicked his fingers, and the emerald water surged again, forming four solid shields to block the incoming sword beams.

"Clang!"

Yet the sharpness of the sword beams exceeded his expectations. In a single clash, the four water shields were cleaved apart.

The golden sword beams flickered like lightning, slashing toward his neck, brow, and heart—vital points where the lethal intent made his scales stand on end, sending chills down his spine.

"Whoosh!"

He twisted his serpentine body desperately, summoning a massive surge of water to intercept the sword beams.

But these beams carried not only the swiftness and precision of swordplay but also the peerless sharpness of the Golden Bamboo Sword.

The might of a sword cultivator lay not only in technique but also in the weapon itself.

Where the sword beams struck, nothing could stand in their way. Ordinary seals and artifacts were useless against them.

"Clang!"

Despite his frantic dodging, the youth could not match the speed of the sword beams. In an instant, eighteen deep, bone-exposing wounds appeared on his body, blood gushing forth in a gruesome display.

Had it not been for the translucent, ice-like water veil protecting him, that single strike would have killed him outright.

"Eighteen sword beams from a mid-grade spirit sword—how can they be so powerful?"

His face paled slightly, but his eyes gleamed with excitement.

Though the old turtle had warned him of the might of eighteen sword beams, witnessing it firsthand was another matter entirely.

A single strike, unstoppable and swift—it could sever a head in an instant, leaving no room for thought or evasion.

Had he been any less capable, his head would already be rolling.

"Good, good! Such talent and comprehension are truly peerless. I must have them!"

The serpent-tailed youth’s face twisted with excitement as he stared at Gu Yuan like a butcher eyeing livestock.

Gu Yuan remained expressionless. As the youth blathered, he simply activated his sword seal again, sending the eighteen sword beams streaking toward his foe.

"Lock!"

But at that moment, the youth smirked coldly and hurled a small, serpentine seal toward Gu Yuan.

"Whoosh!"

The seal, forged from unknown materials, twisted in midair, transforming into a spectral serpent that pierced through space, moving faster than the sword beams. In an instant, it burrowed into Gu Yuan’s dantian.

"Hiss!"

The serpent’s shadow coiled around Gu Yuan’s "Golden Rainbow Foundation," just as it had earlier ensnared the Seven-Phase Exquisite Pagoda.

In that moment, a bizarre scene unfolded within Gu Yuan’s dantian.

Within the golden sun composed of countless metallic energies, an emerald serpent coiled, obscuring the sword light and eclipsing the sun.

Worse, a third of Gu Yuan’s spiritual energy was instantly sealed.

"Hum!"

The eighteen sword beams faltered, flickering as if on the verge of dissipating.

The Foundation was the essence of a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s power.

Not only did it grant them supernatural abilities—commanding water and fire, harnessing wind and thunder—but it was also the source of their spiritual energy.

If the Foundation were destroyed, a cultivator with centuries of lifespan would instantly lose all power, reduced to a mere mortal.

This sinister serpent seal, whatever its origins, could lock a cultivator’s Foundation and seal their energy—truly a masterstroke of sabotage!

Meanwhile, the serpent-tailed youth’s demonic aura waned drastically, as though his power had vanished entirely. Only his physical body remained agile.

"Hah! Human brat, what can your sword seal do now?"

"Without spiritual energy, you’re nothing but meat on a chopping block!"

"How can a mere human body compare to my demonic form, honed over two centuries?"

The serpent-tailed youth thrashed his tail, stirring waves as he laughed triumphantly.

"Clang!"

But in that instant, the eighteen sword beams blazed anew, shining with unparalleled brilliance. In a flash, they severed the youth’s head.

His expression froze in shock before his body collapsed, lifeless. Only disbelief remained in his dead eyes.
