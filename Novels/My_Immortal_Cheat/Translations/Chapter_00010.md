# Chapter 10: Ziyuan

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

As the carriage pulled up to the entrance of the arena, a stout man in purple robes led a group of maidservants in a deep bow towards the vehicle. This was a purple-robed steward of the arena, one of only five in total. Apart from the arena manager, they held the highest status. He had received news early that the Prince of Qin’s Heir was heading in this direction. While not certain if His Highness was coming here, even the slightest possibility required preparation, so he had brought his staff to wait.

Inside the carriage, Zhou Tian couldn't hear their voices, but he could see the purple-robed steward bowing outside. Zhou Tian smiled and said to Tian Ling, "Let's go down."

"Mmm." Tian Ling nodded.

Pushing aside the purple-gold carriage curtain, Zhou Tian emerged. A grey-robed servant stood by the carriage, using energy to manifest a dark staircase beneath the carriage frame. Zhou Tian stepped onto the stairs, descending one by one. After dismounting, Zhou Tian turned back and extended his hand.

Tian Ling was slightly surprised to see Zhou Tian's outstretched hand as she emerged. She glanced at the arena staff still bowed before her, then reached out and placed her hand in Zhou Tian's, stepping down the stairs manifested by the servant. Once Tian Ling was down, Zhou Tian turned back and said, "Rise."

"Thank you, Your Highness!" The purple-robed steward bowed again before straightening up.

"Lead the way inside," Zhou Tian told the stout man in purple before him.

"This way, Your Highness!" The purple-robed stout man slightly turned to the side and gestured.

The group of maidservants behind him also chimed in, "This way, Your Highness!" They parted to clear a path.

"Let's go." In the original body's memories, Zhou Tian was long accustomed to such scenes, having even witnessed grander ones. His heart remained calm as he quietly spoke to Tian Ling beside him. Tian Ling nodded, leaning closer to Zhou Tian. She seemed a bit unaccustomed to such a display; after all, she was a sect disciple. Within the Haotian Sect, everyone was a fellow disciple. Who was nobler than whom? Such a scene was virtually unheard of.

The arena's entrance consisted of two stone gates, ten meters high, their surfaces gleaming with an obsidian-like luster. Each gate was adorned with a carved mythical beast, which, despite being mere carvings, gave the unsettling impression of constantly watching you.

Stepping into the arena, a cacophony of shouts, mixed with the smell of blood, assailed them.
"Fight! Fight!"
"Twist his head off!"
"..."

The arena utilized a spatial expansion array, with the entire first floor containing a hundred rings. Each ring was ten by ten units in size, and every one hosted a fight. Large crowds surrounded them, yelling hoarsely, faces flushed, spit flying. In their hands, they held white tokens—their bets.

Upon seeing the purple-robed steward leading Zhou Tian in, the people nearby instinctively made way. Although they didn't recognize Zhou Tian, they recognized the purple-robed steward. Anyone personally escorted by him was certainly not someone they could afford to offend.

"Yeah! I won, I won!"
"...Get up! Get up now!"
In a nearby ring, one of the fighters fell and remained down. The other, covered in blood, raised his hands and roared. Among the crowd around the ring, some jumped excitedly, having won their bets, while others looked utterly dejected, eyes bloodshot, dropping their tokens. Staff members walked onto the ring, carried off the fallen fighter, and prepared for the next match. The raw savagery of humanity was on full display here.

However, the fights on the first-floor rings were mostly between cultivators of low cultivation, relying on brute force with no flashy or powerful divine abilities or techniques. Zhou Tian frowned and said to the purple-robed steward beside him, "Take us to the VIP room."

"Yes, Your Highness, but Heavenly Suite One is occupied today. I can only take you to Heavenly Suite Two." The purple-robed stout man spoke in a low voice. They were within a silencing array, so while the outside world was noisy, it didn't disturb them.

"Occupied? Which Highness is it?" Zhou Tian asked, curious. The Heavenly Suites were reserved for imperial family members, with twenty in total. Normally, no one would come unless an astonishing genius or a Hundred-Battle King appeared, prompting someone to recruit them or observe their fights. He hadn't expected someone to be here today.

"This..." A difficult expression appeared on the purple-robed stout man's face.

"Alright, I understand. You don't need to say more." Seeing his hesitation, Zhou Tian didn't press him. Imperial family members were all important figures. The purple-robed steward didn't know if speaking up would displease that person, and he dared not gamble even on a slight possibility. Yet, not speaking might displease the person before him, hence his predicament. Zhou Tian was merely curious, not overly keen on knowing, so there was no need to make things difficult for a steward.

"Thank you for your understanding, Your Highness!" The purple-robed stout man's face showed gratitude as he led Zhou Tian towards the VIP rooms.

The Heavenly Suites were on the top floor and accessed directly via a spatial array, eliminating the need for stairs. The purple-robed steward led Zhou Tian to a raised platform embedded in the floor, intricately carved with dense silver runes. Once Zhou Tian and Tian Ling stood upon it, the purple-robed stout man cast a golden rune. All the silver runes on the platform floated up, like a holographic projection, swirling around them. Moments later, the silver runes glowed brilliantly, enveloping them before they vanished from the platform.

Meanwhile, the purple-robed stout man took out a purple rune tablet, upon which a soft glow shimmered. He whispered into it, "The Prince of Qin’s Heir has gone to Heavenly Suite Two."

"Understood," a clear female voice replied from the tablet.

When Zhou Tian and Tian Ling reappeared, they were in an exquisitely decorated room. It was hundreds of square meters in size, adorned with exquisite gold and jade, glazed lamps, and purple carpets with sandalwood tables. A faint, subtle fragrance emanated from the golden lamp oil in the glazed lamps; this was specially made lamp oil, effective for calming the mind and warding off evil.

In the room stood a tall woman of alluring beauty. Though not as stunning as Tian Ling, her attire was provocative: a purple qipao slit high to her upper thighs, and a wide opening at the neck revealing ample white skin, a truly captivating sight.

Upon seeing Zhou Tian appear, she bowed slightly and said, "Greetings, Your Highness."

"You may rise!" Zhou Tian said, slightly disoriented by the dazzling sight before him.

"Yes, Your Highness. I am Ziyuan, the attendant for Heavenly Suite Two, responsible for serving Your Highness. Please do not hesitate to command me with anything!" Ziyuan looked up at Zhou Tian, her eyes shimmering with watery light, deliberately emphasizing the word "anything." She completely ignored Tian Ling beside him. She remembered the descendants of major figures in the imperial city with perfect clarity. In her eyes, this was just another playmate of Zhou Tian's.
