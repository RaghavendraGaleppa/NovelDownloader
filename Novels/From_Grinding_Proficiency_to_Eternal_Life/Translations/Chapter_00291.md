# Chapter 291: Where There Are People, There Is a Jianghu

Sleeves fluttering, a black iron tally shot into the ground. "In three days, the 'Thirty-Six Linked Stages' will open. If Xu Yunfan can fight eighteen consecutive matches on the Xuanxiao Peak without losing, it will count as half the peak's recognition. How about that?"

The proposal caused an uproar.

Even Cui Yu’s pupils constricted. The Thirty-Six Linked Stages was a trial that the Dao Sect had not opened for decades. The stage defender had to face the successive challenges of the true disciples from various peaks, and the final trial was personally overseen by the Peak Master!

Bi Yuan turned his head, looking at Li Zhi with a half-smile. "Since that's the case, shouldn't there be a wager? Li Shidi, that Dragon-Tiger Golden Pill of yours should be about to be refined, right? If Yunfan wins, wouldn't it be fitting to give him that pill as a prize?"

Li Zhi clearly hadn't expected Bi Yuan to go so far. His expression shifted unpredictably.

But with the arrow already on the string, he could only harden his tone and say, "If he loses..."

"Then he simply won't enter the Sword Burial Abyss." Bi Yuan's tone was as flat as if he were discussing the weather, yet Xu Yunfan clearly saw a hint of bloodlust flicker at the tip of his horsetail whisk.

Having said that, Bi Yuan turned his head, his gaze like lightning, fixing directly on Li Zhi.

"Shidi, what else do you want? Should I pass the true manual of the Qingwei Mountain to you?"

Li Zhi tugged at the corner of his mouth, screaming in his heart, *Who wants your true manual? Do you think the Dragon-Tiger Peak doesn't have one?! I want you to expel him from the sect so I can take him as my disciple!*

"......Fine!"

Li Zhi took a deep breath and agreed.

How could this be considered a mere wager?

It was clearly forcing Li Zhi to stake his precious pill!

Bi Yuan turned his head, looking at Xu Yunfan. "Yunfan, are you willing?"

He paused, then added gently, "If you are unwilling and find it troublesome, you don't need to overthink it. Just focus on practicing martial arts in peace."

Li Zhi’s expression stiffened. He truly hadn't expected Bi Yuan to say something like this.

Meeting Bi Yuan's gaze, Xu Yunfan took a deep breath and suddenly took half a step forward. "This disciple is willing to accept the challenge."

His voice was neither humble nor arrogant, but his back was taut like a fully drawn bow.

Bi Yuan couldn't help but reveal a hint of a smile and nodded slightly. Although he had heard many reputations about Xu Yunfan, only on the stage would he know the true substance.

Xu Yunfan caught a glimpse of Li Zhi moving a sword seal in his sleeve and knew that this battle was no longer just a simple contest for qualification.

The forces lurking in the shadows were waiting to see this "discarded disciple of the Heavenly Work Cave" bleed on the training grounds!

"Good! You have courage!"

A burly man with a beard suddenly stepped out from behind the red-faced old man; he was an elder from the Candle Dragon Peak.

He bared his white teeth in a grin. "The first match will be played by our peak's 'Little Thunderclap,' Wu Zhen. I heard you're quite good with a hammer?"

This was clearly targeting Xu Yunfan's Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Halberd.

Bi Yuan suddenly swept his horsetail whisk, creating an invisible wall of qi that separated the crowd. "We shall stop here for today."

He looked deeply at Xu Yunfan and transmitted his voice, *Cangming will take you to the Weapon Grave to pick a suitable weapon.*

As he turned to leave, the hem of his Daoist robe brushed past Li Zhi's side, actually carving seven deep sword marks, an inch deep, into the ground.

Li Zhi’s pupils shrank as he watched.

This old不死 [undying/death-defying] guy, his cultivation seems to have improved again.

The Sect Master actually used his robe as a sword to silently demonstrate his power, carving a sword mark right into the ground!

As Xu Yunfan followed Cui Yu out of the hall, he heard the grey-robed old man sigh lowly: "Li Zhi has secretly colluded with at least twelve peaks... Kid, do you know why the Sect Master would rather open the stages than compromise?"

Seeing Xu Yunfan shake his head, he pointed towards the Sword Burial Abyss shrouded in mist in the distance. "There lies the 'Calamity' accumulated by the Dao Sect over three thousand years. Someone is afraid that if you become the Sect Master, the other peaks will never have a chance to rise again. Years ago, when Li Zhi and Bi Yuan competed for the Sect Master position, it almost turned the world upside down."

Xu Yunfan followed Cui Yu out of the hall and immediately saw Chu Cangming standing with his hands behind his back on the stone steps outside the hall. A black Daoist robe fluttered gently in the wind, and a sword intent seemed to flow between his eyebrows.

Seeing the two come out, the corner of his mouth hooked slightly. First, he respectfully greeted Li Zhi, addressing him as Senior Uncle, then his gaze paused briefly on Xu Yunfan. He said indifferently, "Shidi, since you have just entered the Dao Sect, my Master ordered me to take you to the Weapon Grave to choose a suitable weapon."

Cui Yu gave Chu Cangming a meaningful look, his withered palm lightly patting Xu Yunfan's shoulder. "Go on. The matter of the Sword Burial Abyss... will be resolved in three days. Rest well these few days."

Having said that, he stepped into the air and vanished before the two of them in an instant.

Xu Yunfan withdrew his gaze and asked with some curiosity, "Senior Brother Chu, it seems Senior Uncle Cui doesn't seem to like you very much?"

Chu Cangming's eye twitched. *Is this something a person of normal intelligence would say?*

Xu Yunfan naturally knew how foolish his words sounded, but he did it on purpose. Having cultivated the Lin Character Mantra for so long, his senses were extremely sharp after reaching minor success.

This Senior Brother Chu before him, though appearing as a cold and aloof swordsman, actually harbored quite a bit of malice toward him.

"There are many people in the sect. There will always be people who like you, and people who don't," Chu Cangming responded淡淡 [lightly/distantly], then signaled for Xu Yunfan to follow.

The mountain path wound downward. The green stone steps were covered with a thin layer of frost, making a slight crunching sound underfoot.

Xu Yunfan followed Chu Cangming down Qingwei Mountain and through the mist-shrouded mountainside. Suddenly, a solitary peak appeared before them, piercing the clouds like a sword. It was the famous "Weapon Hall Sword Peak" of the Dao Sect.

The cave at the base of the peak was half-hidden by vines, and the cliff face was carved with four ancient seal characters: "Weapons Cease." The inscription had weathered and become indistinct.

Before the stone steps at the base of the peak, two disciples of the Weapon Hall dressed in black tight-fitting clothes stood holding swords, silver thread cross-sword patterns embroidered on their sleeves.

Seeing Chu Cangming and Xu Yunfan approaching, the disciple on the left took a step forward, his scabbard striking the cliff with a *clang*. "The Sword Peak is a restricted area. Please present your Sword Order."

Chu Cangming slid a bronze token from his sleeve. The characters "Qingwei" on the front glimmered with a faint green light.

The disciple brushed his fingers over the token to confirm it was genuine, then both disciples stepped back half a step simultaneously, their scabbards scraping two sparks against the green stone. "Please."

The vines parted silently, revealing a deep, dark corridor.

As Xu Yunfan stepped forward, he caught a glimpse of a half-erased line of text below the "Weapons Cease" inscription on the cliff wall.

"...Only Calamity Endures."

The cold air inside the cave was piercing. Water droplets seeping from the stone walls froze into frost the moment they hit the ground. Footsteps echoed in the narrow tunnel, as if countless people were following in the dark.

The so-called "Weapon Grave" turned out to be a giant cavern embedded in the belly of the mountain.

The dome was over a hundred yards high, inlaid with hundreds of night pearls, illuminating the interior as bright as day.

The walls were carved with countless stone niches, displaying spears, swords, halberds, axes, halberds, hooks, and forks, as well as strange weapons like chain blades and bone whips, all exuding a cold, harsh light.

"The Weapon Grave holds thirty-six thousand weapons, all spoils of war from the Dao Sect's历代 [past generations] conquests," Chu Cangming said.

His fingertips brushed over a crimson long spear, and the shaft immediately ignited with a flame an inch long. "Two hundred years ago, the treasure of the Xuanzhen Sect, the 'Wandering Plains Spear,' was severed by the previous Sect Master in one sword strike. It became a war trophy here. The Xuanzhen Sect has asked for it back many times, but we never returned it."

His tone was flat, spoken casually, but Xu Yunfan could clearly imagine how thrilling the events behind it must have been.

The great war between major sects two hundred years ago was ignited by the Sword Pavilion's 'Heavenly Sword,' the one known as Dugu Qiu.
