**Chapter 238: Refinement of the Nine-Orifice Stone Fetus**

Thump-thump—

Following closely behind the cool Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits, a group of dozens of people, upon entering the hall, subconsciously looked towards Feng Wuyu and the others, then their bodies stiffened abruptly.

"What terrifying auras!" Everyone exclaimed silently in their hearts.

Especially the Dao Integration Realm man from Taiyi Pavilion, who was walking at the very front. The composure on his face was instantly shattered. The higher his cultivation, the more he could truly perceive the terrifying nature of those few individuals. Although they were all in the Dao Integration Realm, the strong sense of crisis in his heart constantly reminded the man that, in front of these people, he was not much different from a mortal. He could be effortlessly crushed.

In an instant, he reacted. "True Disciples! These people are definitely True Disciples from a Grotto-Heaven!" A trace of shock flashed in the man's heart. His gaze involuntarily fell upon Zhang Jing, who was seated in the highest position. Although he was only at the Golden Core Realm, his expression was as calm as still water. A murmur arose in his heart. Although this one's cultivation wasn't high, judging by this posture, his status among the True Disciples didn't seem low?

The next moment, before Zhang Jing could speak, "Junior Brother greets Senior Brother Zhang Jing, and all True Disciple Senior Brothers!" The man bowed respectfully, speaking with reverence. Behind him, the moment they heard the voice, the others, disregarding the trembling in their hearts, followed suit, bowing and calling out in unison: "We pay our respects to Senior Brother Zhang Jing, and to all True Disciples!"

As their voices fell, "Please take your seats, Junior Brothers and Sisters, there's no need for such formality." Zhang Jing's gentle voice instantly echoed through the hall.

One by one, exquisite and translucent Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits filed out. Some held tables, some held meditation cushions, and others carried spiritual wine and immortal fruits. Before long, everyone was seated.

His gaze swept over the people below. Then, Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed. "To see them here, what a serendipitous encounter," a barely perceptible faint smile flashed across his face as he thought to himself.

Not long after, the Dao Integration Realm man who had spoken first took a deep breath, then rose from his seat and stepped forward a few paces. He cupped his hands and said enthusiastically: "Junior Brother Guo Donglai, on behalf of all the Daoist disciples of Taiyi Pavilion in Myriad Peaks Plain, Eastern Pole Immortal Continent, I offer congratulations to Senior Brother Zhang Jing on establishing his Dao Palace. This small, meager gift is but a token of our regard; please do not take offense, Senior Brother."

"If Senior Brother has any leisure, we sincerely hope you can visit Taiyi Pavilion to offer guidance. We will certainly sweep our floors to welcome you."

"Haha, Junior Brother Guo is too polite," Zhang Jing said with a faint smile, speaking courteously. As he spoke, Bing Lengleng (Coolie) darted out from the side, excitedly 'receiving' the treasure box glowing with a faint immortal light from the man's hand. This action was like flipping a switch.

Once the other party returned to his seat, five people, including You Yuanming, led by a middle-aged man with an honest face, also rose from their seats and walked to the center of the hall, saying reservedly: "Xu Jiu of Dongming Blessed Land, in accordance with the decree of our Blessed Land's Immortal Lord, has specially brought these Junior Brothers and Sisters to congratulate Senior Brother Zhang Jing on establishing his Dao Palace."

"Junior Brother Xu, you've gone to great trouble. Please convey my thanks to Martial Uncle Shang of your esteemed Blessed Land," Zhang Jing said with a smile. Naturally, he wasn't completely unacquainted with Dongming Blessed Land, which was near his Dao Palace. The Lord of the Blessed Land was named Shang Yanzhi, an Earth Immortal of the Dao Sect.

"Junior Brother will certainly deliver the message," the middle-aged man replied, cupping his hands.

But at this moment, Zhang Jing suddenly looked at You Yuanming among the group and said with a smile: "Brother You, it's been nearly fifty years since we parted ways at the Lower Realm's Dao Academy, hasn't it? I wonder how you've been recently?" He did not address the other party as "Senior Brother" as he had done in the Lower Realm. On one hand, speaking so casually in front of so many people, especially Senior Brother Feng Wuyu and the others, would be inappropriate for his current status. On the other hand, such a form of address would naturally not be beneficial for You Yuanming either.

As his voice sounded, dozens of gazes in the hall immediately fell upon You Yuanming. You Yuanming's body stiffened abruptly, then he said with a trembling voice: "Thank you for your concern, Senior Brother. This Junior Brother is doing well in the Blessed Land."

In his heart, he secretly let out a sigh of relief. *It's a good thing Junior Brother Zhang Jing... no, Senior Brother didn't insist on the old address from the Lower Realm. Otherwise, I truly wouldn't know how to handle myself right now!*

"Haha, that's good then. From now on, if you have any problems, just come to Ling Shu Mountain to find me. When we were in the Lower Realm, the Academy Head specifically exhorted me to look after you and Brother Nong Xingzhou in the Upper Realm." Zhang Jing said gently, completely devoid of any jest.

As soon as these words were uttered, the gazes of the crowd towards You Yuanming were filled with intense envy. This person actually seemed to have a deep connection with a Dao Sect True Disciple, and had even received a promise from him that he could come to his Dao Palace anytime... What kind of tremendous fortune had he stumbled upon?

"This lucky fellow named You Yuanming is probably about to soar!" A common thought arose in everyone's minds simultaneously.

In place, "Thank you, Senior Brother Zhang. Junior Brother will remember," You Yuanming's eyes couldn't help but flash with a touch of emotion. He wasn't a child of a few decades; of course, he understood the intention behind Zhang Jing's words.

...

...

Time slowly flowed by.

"Junior Brother, I shall take my leave now. If you need anything, feel free to come find me at Azure God Palace on Golden Rooster Mountain," Feng Wuyu said outside the Dao Palace gates, his tone a mix of jest and instruction. Hearing this, a trace of embarrassment flashed across Zhang Jing's face, then he smiled and nodded, saying: "Senior Brother, travel safely." Only after the bronze divine light, into which the other party had transformed, disappeared from sight did he turn and return to his Dao Palace.

As Zhang Jing's figure vanished, a heaven-reaching black and white immortal light flashed by. In an instant, Ling Shu Mountain Dao Palace became hazy and ethereal, giving off a peculiar sensation of being both close by and infinitely far away, visible yet unreachable.

...

...

Main Peak.

"Alas~, after all, our statuses are different now; there's no going back," a long, melancholic sigh suddenly echoed through the empty hall. Zhang Jing sat quietly on his meditation cushion, no longer dwelling on the sense of unfamiliarity and distance he felt when You Yuanming and Qiu Han spoke with him earlier. Behind his head, a six-layered auspicious cloud slowly rose, six-colored immortal light circulating ceaselessly, imbued with infinite profound mysteries.

At this point, the matter of the sermon was completely concluded, and combined with the gains during the process, Zhang Jing naturally had to strike while the iron was hot and enter seclusion for cultivation.

In an instant, Zhang Jing's expression became devoid of joy or sorrow, his eyes as calm as a thousand-fathom deep pool. His previous numerous insights reappeared in his mind. His eyes grew even brighter. "Wrong! Although the divine ability I fused upon entering the Golden Core Realm was not the Innate Primordial Immortal Light recorded in the Derivation World Path's legacy, but rather the stronger Taiyi Heavenly Gang Myriad Gods' Natal World, fundamentally... this has not transcended the framework of the Derivation World Path!"

"Therefore, the cultivation path of the Derivation World Path in the Golden Core Realm is still fundamental to me."

"The remaining three hundred and twenty-nine fundamental Dao Intents still need to be cultivated and fully integrated into the Grand Beginning Golden Core, transforming into nine Mid-Third Rank Great Divine Abilities. Only then can the Grand Beginning Golden Core conceive the Origin of the World and the Opportunity of Creation."

"Of course, due to the existence of the Taiyi Heavenly Gang Myriad Gods' Natal World, and even the Grand Pure Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade, the Dharma Idol that ultimately transforms will most likely not be the Grand Beginning Primordial Egg, but undoubtedly, it will be even stronger!"

As time passed little by little, Zhang Jing's mind became increasingly clear and lucid. "The nine Mid-Third Rank Great Divine Abilities: Primordial Six Energies, Life, Death, Being, Non-Being, Dao-Born Treasure Furnace, Shrink Ground to an Inch, Fetal Breathing Heaven and Earth, Mind-Image Unceasing, Three Calamity Tribulation Light... these are not innate divine abilities after all. Once fused, they should be directly upgradeable with jade talismans."

"So—" His eyes flashed, and his mind suddenly pulled away from his enlightenment. How vast was the experience needed to upgrade Mid-Third Rank divine abilities? Moreover, there were nine of them in a row. Could he possibly upgrade all of them to the Immortal Seed stage in his lifetime? Zhang Jing couldn't help but furrow his brows slightly. Of course, not upgrading them to the Immortal Seed stage wouldn't affect his cultivation progression to the Dharma Idol Realm, or even the Dao Integration Realm. He could even still far surpass ordinary cultivators of the Derivation World Path of the Grand Beginning Primordial Realm. But... it wouldn't be complete after all!

The next moment, as if realizing something, a Nine-Orifice Stone Fetus quietly appeared in Zhang Jing's hand. To do good work, one must first sharpen one's tools. It would be better to refine it into a clone first. Then, he could have the stone fetus clone constantly reside in Three Origins City, carrying the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Immortal Seed, and fully refine post-natal purple qi. Although it would be a drop in the bucket, having something was better than nothing.

"Forget it. It's said the Great Dao has fifty, Heaven's evolution is forty-nine, and one is escaped. Even Heaven and Earth are like this, so why should I insist on absolute perfection? Just do my best to advance," Zhang Jing comforted himself in his heart. Of course, having such a thought was also born of helplessness.

As if possessed by a strange impulse, Zhang Jing suddenly remembered the Origin Crystals his master had given him earlier. If he had enough Origin Crystals— The next moment, *What am I thinking about?* Just by observing his master and various martial uncles' reactions at the time, he knew the preciousness of Origin Crystals. Why entertain such unrealistic desires? Zhang Jing shook his head with a smile.

He then focused all his attention on the Nine-Orifice Stone Fetus in his hand, recalling the method of refining clones that his martial uncle had taught him earlier. Before long, faint strands of mysterious aura began to spread out.

...

...

On the other side, inside Taiyi Pavilion, a dozen figures sat in the main hall, their auras varying in strength.

"So, Junior Brother Guo, your meaning is that this True Disciple from Ling Shu Mountain holds no low status within the Scarlet Brilliance Grand Clear Grotto-Heaven?" The man seated at the head spoke, confirming with a hint of seriousness in his voice.

"Exactly, Senior Brother! This time, when he gave his sermon, there were actually five other True Disciples from the Scarlet Brilliance Grand Clear Grotto-Heaven who came to show their support. And one of them, if this Junior Brother is not mistaken, should be the legendary Thirteenth True Disciple of the Dao Sect, Senior Brother Feng Wuyu!"
