# Chapter 51: Elimination  

The fourth brother arrived before the main chamber. Activating his *Material Manipulation Technique*, a spiritual hand silently entered the room and undid the door latch.  

The entire process was smoother than that of a professional thief—fluid and effortless, without the slightest delay in his movement. It was as if someone inside had opened the door just for him.  

With a casual wave of his hand, the spiritual energy hand knocked out Siqin, who had been dozing off.  

Siqin had been sitting on a stool outside the study, her body tilting as she began to collapse. The spiritual hand caught her and gently laid her on the ground. The fourth brother had no intention of harming a mortal.  

This wasn’t out of kindness but fear—fear of Gu Jia, fear of the Tianhai Sect.  

Using spiritual techniques to kill a mortal within the capital would be a direct affront to the Tianhai Sect and Gu Jia’s authority. For the sake of a mere maid, he had no desire to risk Gu Jia’s relentless pursuit.  

As for Li Shiming, he was a cultivator. Killing him would merely be a feud between practitioners, something the Tianhai Sect wouldn’t interfere with. The only trouble might come from Gu Jia.  

But the Hao family had to retaliate. Ever since the deaths of their two cultivators and their subsequent inaction, the Hao family’s prestige in the capital’s vicinity had suffered greatly.  

Moreover, the Hao family had investigated Li Shiming’s relationship with Gu Jia. Gu Jia valued Li Shiming only while he was alive. Once dead, even if Gu Jia traced the matter back to them, the worst they’d face was some compensation—a small price to pay.  

The fourth brother reached the study door, his spiritual hand once again slipping inside.  

Contrary to his expectations, Li Shiming’s weakness had given him a new idea.  

He decided to assassinate him using mortal means, avoiding any overt spiritual attacks to minimize the chances of Gu Jia discovering his involvement.  

The *Material Manipulation Technique* was a special spell. If used carefully, the residual spiritual fluctuations would be minimal and dissipate quickly, leaving almost no trace.  

Just as his spiritual hand was pulling the latch, he sensed a faint ripple of spiritual energy from within the study.  

Before he could discern its source, five *Golden Metal Needles* pierced through the wooden door and struck him.  

The fourth brother had believed his *Invisibility Talisman* concealed him completely, that Li Shiming couldn’t see him.  

But under the infrared sensors, his heat signature was as clear as day to Li Shiming.  

The moment the fourth brother laid Siqin on the ground, Li Shiming had already gathered his spiritual energy, activating the *Primary Golden Metal Talisman* in his hand.  

The distance between the study door and Li Shiming was barely four meters. The *Golden Metal Needles*, forged with the essence of metallic bullets, moved at an even greater speed.

**Calculated Strike**  

Caught off guard and unwilling to use spiritual energy defensively, the fourth brother was struck by all five needles.  

They pierced his face and heart, leaving him no time to retrieve a defensive artifact from his storage pouch.  

Still wary, Li Shiming fired another five *Golden Metal Needles*, striking vital points once more.  

Watching the fading heat signature on the infrared display, Li Shiming knew he had successfully countered the assassination attempt.  

Opening the study door, he first checked on Siqin and sighed in relief.  

He hadn’t been able to save her earlier—his own survival had taken precedence. Had he prioritized her, both of them would now be lying lifeless like the cultivator on the ground.  

Carrying Siqin back to her bed, he tucked her in before turning his attention to the fourth brother’s corpse.  

He retrieved the storage pouch from the body. Inside, he found a familiar low-grade sword artifact, its hilt marked with the character *Hao*—standard equipment for a Hao family cultivator.  

There was also a low-grade shield artifact, similarly bearing the *Hao* insignia.  

The rest consisted of various talismans—most of which Li Shiming recognized, though he still had much to learn.  

Two hundred and thirty-eight spirit stones, a jade vial emitting a faint spiritual aura, and five pills of unknown purpose completed the haul.  

“The Hao family again,” Li Shiming muttered darkly. “They’ve clearly marked me.”  

He had two choices:  

First, report the incident to Gu Jia. However, he had no confidence that Gu Jia would side with him over the Hao family.  

After all, the Hao family was one of the market’s overseers, supplying Gu Jia with a steady stream of spirit stones each year.  

Second, handle it himself—resolve this threat in his own way.  

With that thought, he activated a *Primary Lightfoot Talisman*. A faint green glow enveloped his legs.  

He knew the patrol routes of his household guards and how to evade their notice.  

Scaling the courtyard wall, he slipped into the alleyways beyond, moving swiftly through the shadows.  

At full speed, any passerby would have barely glimpsed a blur.  

Traveling at 120 kilometers per hour, he reached the city walls in no time. With a powerful leap, he scaled the fortifications and vaulted over the top.  

Even in the capital of Great Xia, not every section of the wall was heavily guarded during peacetime.  

He had chosen the least defended area—a fact he had confirmed through repeated observation.  

Once outside the city, he maintained his top speed, heading straight for the Hao family’s stronghold.

**Preemptive Strike**  

His mind was clear. The Hao family’s assassination attempt had sealed their fate.  

Tonight, they would be awaiting news of his death, never expecting him to come for them instead.  

Half an hour of relentless sprinting brought him near the Hao family’s location as marked on his map.  

Launching a drone, he donned a visor display.  

As the drone ascended, the Hao compound came into view—a circular arrangement of two-story wooden buildings enclosed by a wall.  

At its center lay a peculiar water feature, an architectural oddity Li Shiming had never seen before.  

Switching the drone to thermal imaging, he counted twenty-four heat signatures.  

He remained still, positioning himself behind two large trees and tall grass, about five hundred meters from the Hao family’s main gate.  

From his storage pouch, he retrieved a monocular telescope—purely mechanical, without night vision or infrared capabilities.  

Yet its magnification reached an impressive 70x, and his steady hands made a tripod unnecessary.  

As the drone’s battery drained, he analyzed the thermal data, pinpointing the remaining four Hao family cultivators.  

In the building facing the gate, four figures were visible—one seated centrally at the rear, the other three positioned to the left and right.  

Li Shiming was eighty percent certain: these were the four Hao cultivators.
