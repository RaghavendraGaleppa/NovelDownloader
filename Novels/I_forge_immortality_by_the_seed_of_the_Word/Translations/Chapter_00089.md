# Chapter 88: The Opening of the Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven

The next day.

"Thirty-Eight, your master has business to attend to outside. During this time, another senior brother will look after you. Don't cause any trouble."

Zhang Jing's voice suddenly echoed through the spirit beast chamber.

The sleeping Deer Thirty-Eight was abruptly startled awake.

Hearing the voice, it instinctively tucked in its neck and replied obediently:

"Understood, Master."

At the very center of Dragon Marsh Lake.

This area was perpetually shrouded in an endless expanse of thick mist—impenetrable to light, unyielding to wind.

An extremely peculiar phenomenon.

Yet today.

The towering mist gradually dissipated, revealing what lay within.

A massive island nearly a hundred li in circumference came into view.

The island was lush and verdant, dotted everywhere with towering spiritual trees dozens of zhang tall. Fragrant spiritual herbs filled the air, hundreds of birds danced and sang, beasts leaped and roamed freely, while fish soared along the shores.

Spiritual energy condensed into mist and rain, and veins of earth energy rose as radiant spiritual light, creating an atmosphere befitting an immortal paradise.

Many disciples of the academy watched from afar.

Yet none dared approach due to the overwhelming pressure emanating from within.

Occasionally, streaks of light and rainbows would fly into the island, eliciting gasps of awe.

At this moment.

On a spacious jade-paved clearing on the island, a considerable crowd had already gathered.

Most were inner court disciples clad in purple robes, with fewer than twenty outer court disciples among them. Every face bore expressions of anticipation and excitement.

Spiritual senses and divine consciousnesses intertwined.

As if engaged in fervent discussion.

Before the crowd, dozens of exquisitely crafted meditation cushions were arranged.

All currently unoccupied.

A streak of rainbow light flashed.

Zhang Jing's figure abruptly appeared.

After surveying the scene, he made his way directly toward the group of outer court disciples.

As Zhang Jing moved.

Countless gazes fell upon him.

Curiosity, bewilderment, envy, skepticism—all manner of looks were directed his way.

Clearly, those who could be here were all more or less aware of Zhang Jing's existence.

Under this concentrated scrutiny, Zhang Jing remained utterly composed.

Ever since word had leaked—no one knew how—that the Thousand Methods Pavilion had identified him as the next Chief Disciple, such attention had become routine whenever he left his cave abode.

Over time.

He'd grown accustomed to it.

Among the crowd.

Liu Lizhi's expression was the most complex.

He had always held some regard for this junior brother.

But who could have imagined that after just one session of closed-door cultivation, the other would suddenly ascend to heights beyond his comprehension?

He had originally planned to recruit Zhang Jing into the Inheritance Pavilion in the future.

"Ah—"

All his complicated thoughts ultimately condensed into a sigh.

Meanwhile.

At the gathering of outer court cultivators.

As Zhang Jing approached, everyone respectfully called out:

"Senior Brother Zhang is here."

"Senior Brother."

Zhang Jing maintained a composed demeanor, nodding and smiling in response, though inwardly he felt somewhat awkward.

Anyone would feel the same being addressed as "senior brother" by a group of people twenty years their senior.

He had tried to dissuade these senior brothers and sisters before.

Only to be told: We should take this chance to call you 'Senior Brother Zhang' as much as possible while we still can—who knows when we'll get another opportunity like this?

What could Zhang Jing do?

He was helpless against such reasoning.

As he pondered.

"Senior Brother Zhang, it's been a while."

"Senior Brother Zhang Jing."

A voice both cool and charming, alongside a deep, rough voice, sounded simultaneously by his ear.

Zhang Jing turned to look.

It was Shen Qingqing and Chen Xiandao approaching together.

"Ah, you two as well."

Zhang Jing shook his head resignedly.

Before long.

A violent fluctuation of spiritual energy occurred.

Dozens of figures—some elderly, some young, some with constantly shifting forms, and others who appeared as nothing more than swirling mist—suddenly appeared on the meditation cushions at the front.

Among them.

Two figures in purple robes stood out conspicuously.

Zhang Jing narrowed his eyes slightly.

"These must be the Pavilion Masters at the Golden Core Divine Ability realm. The Academy Head and Deputy Head are likely here too. As for those two in purple—they must be the legendary Senior Brother You and the chief disciple of the Spiritual Dao Pavilion."

He speculated inwardly.

Just then.

The sky abruptly darkened.

Zhang Jing instinctively looked up.

In his vision.

Two sky-obscuring treasure ships—one crimson, one black—appeared simultaneously from opposite directions. Wherever they passed, thick clouds were shattered, leaving behind massive, chaotic cloud trails that spanned half the sky.

Like two heavenly chains about to intersect.

A spectacular sight.

Just as the two treasure ships approached the airspace above Dragon Marsh Academy.

Three resplendent streaks of light instantly shot up from the ground, reaching the space above the ships in moments.

A voice resonating with the weight of ages echoed across heaven and earth.

"Fellow Daoist Cang, Fellow Daoist Lu, welcome to Dragon Marsh Academy!"

"Haha, Fellow Daoist Qi, you're too kind."

A booming voice immediately responded from within the crimson treasure ship.

As the voice sounded.

The crimson ship suddenly blazed with intense scarlet spiritual light, rising like a great sun as if to surpass the figure above it.

Yet the moment it ascended, an unimaginable force seemed to pull it downward.

"Fellow Daoist Lu, as guests from afar, please descend and rest for now."

A voice tinged with amusement followed.

"Ah, you two have been competing like this for how many years now..."

Meanwhile, the dark treasure ship paid no heed to their contention, beginning a gradual descent as a voice full of helpless laughter emerged from within.

Half an hour later.

Dozens of figures exuding terrifying auras sat cross-legged on the meditation cushions at the front, seemingly discussing the specifics of opening the Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven.

Behind them.

Stood numerous academy disciples in three distinct groups.

On the side of Divine Thunder Academy.

Qin Nian—whose exquisite, doll-like features could captivate any beholder—continuously scanned the Dragon Marsh disciples as if searching for someone.

Before long.

Her eyes lit up as they settled on Zhang Jing, who stood at the center of a group of green-robed disciples.

Comparing him to the information her senior brother had provided.

No mistake—it was him!

The sun passed its zenith.

The various Academy Heads and Pavilion Masters on the cushions seemed to have concluded their discussions, rising to their feet.

"The Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven is about to open. Prepare yourselves and enter in orderly fashion. Is that clear?" A ruddy-faced elder addressed the assembled inner court disciples sternly.

"Understood!"

Came the unified response.

"Good!" The elder nodded.

Soon after.

The entire island began to tremble.

Abruptly.

A towering ancient gate—nine zhang high and six zhang wide—materialized in midair, its oppressive aura flooding the surroundings.

Boom—!

The gates swung open, revealing a vista of swirling chaos within.

"Enter quickly now."

No sooner had the words been spoken.

The inner court disciples transformed into streaks of light without hesitation, vanishing through the gates in rapid succession.

"So beyond that gate lies the Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven?"

A glimmer of curiosity flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

Seeing the crowd thinning around him.

He hesitated no longer, transforming into a rainbow streak himself.
