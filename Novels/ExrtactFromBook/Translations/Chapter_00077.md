# Chapter 77: Minor Thunder Sound Technique

After executing that sword strike enhanced by his divine ability, Han Yue immediately sheathed his sword and stood still. 

His eyes remained tightly shut as he carefully savored the sensation of that last slash. This was his first time channeling his divine ability [Thoughtless Cut] through a third-grade magical weapon, and the sheer power and tactile feedback completely surpassed his expectations!

Once again, Han Yue marveled at the profound mysteries of a top-tier sect's heritage. With the amplification from Shenxiao Palace's secret third-grade artifact, the experience of using his divine ability had transformed entirely. 

An indescribably smooth exhilaration welled up in his heart. The [Demon-Slaying Sword] concentrated the power of his divine ability with at least double the efficiency. The combined enhancement from both artifacts—especially the [Demon-Slaying Sword]—boosted the strike's power by nearly eighty percent!

In other words, Han Yue could now unleash attacks with nearly double the power while expending only half the mana he previously needed. His strength had grown exponentially!

The slash he'd just executed rivaled the power of the strike he'd used to kill the Great Ape. Yet what had once drained him completely now felt effortless.

Han Yue reflected on everything that had happened since meeting Li Changle—forging artifacts, joining the sect, obtaining the heritage. Step by methodical step, his strength had quietly skyrocketed. This was the difference between a disciple of a great sect and a rogue cultivator. 

Now, he had truly stepped onto the fast track of cultivation. The coming period would be his fastest phase of growth yet!

Han Yue raised his sword and unleashed another violet blade beam into the sky. Channeling his divine ability through the [Demon-Slaying Sword] was downright addictive. Wielding this sharp weapon after relying solely on his bare hands filled him with newfound confidence. 

Since the sect grounds were perfectly safe, he spared no expense of his mana. Blade beam after blade beam shot forth, slicing the mountain's clouds into fragments. His mana reserves plummeted rapidly.

Each slash deepened the connection between man and sword, refining the [Demon-Slaying Sword] further. Finally, after another strike, the fourth [Upper Cave Thunder-Shattering Rune] manifested within the blade—just as Han Yue's mana neared complete depletion.

Feeling the emptiness in his dantian, Han Yue laughed heartily and returned to his cave abode to begin another round of secluded cultivation.

As stated in *The Patriarch's Answers for Disciples*:  
"Third-grade magical weapons possess complete properties and unique wonders. Yet only those tempered and nurtured by one's own mana can serve as lifebound vessels of the Dao."

The text continued:  
"When first forged, artifacts are refined within the dantian's mana. As refinement deepens and man and weapon unite, they may be transferred to the sea of consciousness. At this stage, the artifact's power increases dramatically, greatly enhancing its wielder."

"The stronger one's spiritual sense, the more artifacts one may sustain. Disciples should choose their Dao vessels according to their cultivation progress."

Han Yue practiced his *Body-Nourishing Soul Thunder Method* daily without fail, allowing both artifacts to sink naturally into his dantian's mana for continuous refinement. His current task was to shore up all weaknesses in his cultivation and swiftly transform into a true great sect disciple.

During his seclusion, Han Yue contemplated his next steps. Several divine abilities and secret arts awaited his attention. Since he had no immediate plans to leave the mountain, he temporarily set aside combat-enhancing techniques like *Entangling Thunder Robe*, *Breath Concealment Art*, and *Primordial Great Hand Seal* to focus on the *Minor Thunder Sound Technique* from the heritage stele.

This was a mandatory communication art for Shenxiao Palace disciples. When he and Master Li Changle entered the sect, the flickering mana signals exchanged between members had been manifestations of this very technique—the sect's method for identity verification and information exchange among disciples.

*The Patriarch's Answers for Disciples* stated:  
"New disciples must prioritize essence-nourishing techniques before cultivating the *Minor Thunder Sound Technique*. All sect communications, teachings, and guidance are conducted through this art."

According to *Classification of Secret Arts*, the *Minor Thunder Sound Technique* was categorized as a minor divine ability incapable of advancing to supreme status. Yet this humble technique enjoyed immense popularity due to its unique function. 

In the solitary grind of daily cultivation, maintaining regular communication with teachers and peers undoubtedly preserved mental well-being and Dao heart vitality—fulfilling social needs beneficial to cultivation!

As a minor divine ability, the *Minor Thunder Sound Technique* wasn't complex. It comprised just two sections:

The first explained how to encode and transmit information by modulating mana fluctuations and pulses. For most Shenxiao disciples, this initial hurdle proved exceptionally difficult. Transmitting sound and images through mana frequencies seemed like fantasy to the uninitiated—akin to building a broadcast system using nothing but a *Color Television Repair Manual*.

But for Han Yue, with his past life's experiences, this section was child's play. 

As a former elite air force pilot, astronaut candidate, and decorated captain, his understanding of communication engineering was instinctive. Compared to other Shenxiao disciples, he possessed profound theoretical foundations. To him, the *Minor Thunder Sound Technique* was simply a primitive wireless communication method—extremely rudimentary compared to the technologies he'd known.

Relying entirely on this world's extraordinary mana and cultivators' personal power, it achieved decent results despite high energy consumption and poor transmission efficiency. Such high barriers made large-scale adoption impossible unlike in his previous life.

With his enhanced comprehension and photographic memory, Han Yue mastered the first section in just over ten days—even casually optimizing the mana signals for greater stability, clarity, and efficiency.

The second section proved simpler: combining one's mana attributes with a chosen divine ability to form an identifying sigil per the technique's instructions. 

Since Han Yue's mana aligned closely with [Thoughtless Cut], he selected another ability. Merging his mana signature with [Golden Light Escape Technique], he formed a dagger-shaped mark woven from golden light that immediately appeared on his right hand's back.

Thus, the *Minor Thunder Sound Technique* was successfully mastered—Han Yue's first self-comprehended divine ability! 

But then came an unexpected development: mastering this technique triggered a reaction from the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws*!
