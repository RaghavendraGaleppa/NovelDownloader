# Chapter 631: Master Xu Rewards and Punishes with Clear Distinction

Particularly those from the Elven race. The information Xu Yunfan obtained indicated they do not age or die, which naturally sparked his immense curiosity.

A Golden Core True Lord who has stepped into the mid-Golden Core stage, capable of holding a Heaven Realm aloft without it falling, can undergo infinite reincarnations without losing their power, thereby achieving a form of alternative longevity.

Aside from that, even a mid-Golden Core cultivator, if unable to break through, will eventually decline. Although their innate wisdom may persist, returning to the Golden Core stage after several lifetimes of reincarnation is an arduous, nearly impossible task.

After squeezing every last drop of valuable information from Dilys, Xu Yunfan pushed the thoroughly indoctrinated woman aside.

Thankfully, his physical body could now change size at will; otherwise, he might not have been able to handle it.

After resting, Xu Yunfan left the collapsing Divine Kingdom space and casually found a location to begin the most crucial step.

He sat cross-legged and placed the wisp of attributeless, immortal golden nature obtained from Dilys into the core of his Sea of Consciousness.

The *Mystic Firmament Nine Chasms Purple Vault Indestructible Scripture* operated at full capacity. The nascent Heaven Realm within his Dantian Qi Sea trembled slightly, emanating a powerful suction force.

His spirit, energy, and will converged intensely, like the True Samadhi Fire, carefully guiding and refining this foreign wisp of attributeless golden nature.

This was an extremely delicate and dangerous process.

If it were the golden nature from the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, or the wisp of Taiyin Immortal Golden Nature he obtained from the Heavenly Empress, Xu Yunfan would not dare to do this.

After all, these golden natures had already been refined and contained the will of others' Dao. If he rashly refined them, there was a high probability it would destroy his own cultivation.

Only a fool would do that.

It was precisely because it was from Aeterna.

Although this golden nature was pure, it was his first time handling it, so Xu Yunfan had to be extremely careful.

Using his vast Mystic Firmament Divine Power as the hammer, his tenacious will as the anvil, and the nascent Heaven Realm as the furnace, he meticulously removed the extremely faint traces belonging to Aeterna's Dao within the golden nature.

He purified it repeatedly dozens of times before finally feeling at ease, fearing even a shred of mixed, impure incense and faith power remained.

Having done all this, Xu Yunfan slowly merged his own life imprint, along with his understanding of Mystic Firmament Thunder and the Indestructible True Meaning, into it.

Time flowed away amidst the focused refinement.

不知过了多久 (Unknown how much time passed), the wisp of golden light thread that originally only radiated an immortal essence, deep within its core, a barely perceptible purple-gold thunder pattern bearing Xu Yunfan's unique aura quietly emerged.

Immediately after, the golden nature's brilliance turned inward, its form becoming more condensed and resilient, as if transforming from an illusory light and gas into an immortal substance existing between reality and illusion.

It was no longer a masterless golden nature, but had completely imprinted with Xu Yunfan's mark, becoming the first wisp of immortal golden nature truly belonging to himself.

This scene, even though Dilys had become a Banner Spirit and been "educated" by Xu Yunfan dozens of times, still transmitted an unbelievable shock upon seeing it.

In the Aeterna World, divine cores were gifts from the Heavenly Dao, and immortal golden nature was the fruit born from adhering to the divine core and irrigated by faith.

The gods never thought, nor did they need to think, about how to condense such a thing themselves.

In her cognition, Xu Yunfan's behavior was tantamount to breaking the iron laws of the world.

This was stealing the authority of the creator.

Forging immortality from nothingness.

This was a subversion of the Aeterna Heavenly Dao system.

After successfully condensing the first wisp of his own immortal golden nature, Xu Yunfan's heart remained as calm as an ancient well.

This was just the beginning.

According to the common sense of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World and the guidance of the *Mystic Firmament Nine Chasms Purple Vault Indestructible Scripture*, to push the nascent Heaven Realm of the Foundation Establishment late stage to the perfect and flawless Great True Person realm, and to build a solid Dao Foundation sufficient to bear the favor of the Dao Fruit, at least nine wisps of such immortal golden nature are needed as the core framework.

Currently situated in the Aeterna Great World, which Xu Yunfan looked upon with burning desire, before him were the faith sheep herded by the Heavenly Dao system, spread across the mountains and plains.

Those gods, large and small, strong and weak, were all objects of Xu Yunfan's envy.

The divine core of these gods was a ready-made mine rich in attributeless immortal golden nature.

No, I must thank Ye Xuan several times. If not for her, I would still be struggling to rely on massive resources to condense immortal golden nature.

Xu Yunfan immediately summoned Ye Xuan from within the banner and gave her a dozen or so "educations" with seriousness before feeling satisfied.

He, Master Xu, was a master who rewarded and punished with clear distinction.

"What if I condense ninety wisps of immortal golden nature? Or nine hundred wisps?"

A glimmer of light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes.

In theory, the more immortal golden nature, the better. They are like the steel framework of the Dao Foundation. Their quantity and quality determine the potential of the Dao Foundation and the limit of the Dao Fruit power it can bear in the future.

Although the difficulty and risk increase exponentially with each additional wisp refined, the richness of this Great World before him is sufficient to support him accumulating far beyond the conventional limit.

However, what followed was not just the joy of harvest, but a core problem that must be faced.

Imagery.

Reaching the perfection of Foundation Establishment is not merely the accumulation of divine power and golden nature.

It requires the cultivator to summarize and elevate their Dao, condensing an Imagery belonging to themselves.

This is like the Sword Intent of the Sword Cultivators of the Wansheng Sword Sect, a concrete crystallization of the cultivator's lifelong cultivation philosophy, power characteristics, and will pursuit.

This Imagery must be rooted in the true meaning of the *Mystic Firmament Nine Chasms Purple Vault Indestructible Scripture*—the Mystic Firmament Thunder that destroys all methods, and the Purple Vault Indestructible true meaning—yet it must also transcend the framework of the scripture itself, walking a path unique to Xu Yunfan.

"What is my Dao? What should my Imagery be?"

Xu Yunfan fell into brief contemplation.

He had cultivated to this point, enduring trials, struggling for survival in the Divine Martial World, and advancing step by step in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World. What he sought was nothing less than great freedom.

Although he had the Attribute Panel by his side, it was also the result of his hard work and struggle step by step.

To not be manipulated by others, to be able to cultivate freely, to explore the peak of the Immortal Path, and even to achieve longevity.

This longing for freedom vaguely resonates with the supreme Yang and extreme Yang, destroying all obstacles and束缚 (restraints) of the Mystic Firmament Thunder true meaning he cultivates.

But the word "freedom" alone seems too vague to bear the Imagery that is about to condense and point towards the *Mystic Firmament Jade Clarity Nine Chasms Purple Vault Myriad Transformations Indestructible Dao Fruit*.

What is the essence of Mystic Firmament Thunder?

Does it contain new life after destruction?

Is the Purple Vault Indestructible a state of eternal constancy, or seeking indestructibility amidst change?

These questions lingered in his mind.

"Forget it, there is still plenty of time."

Xu Yunfan quickly suppressed these thoughts.

The condensation of Imagery cannot be achieved in a single day; it requires natural insight and opportunity.

His cultivation is not yet sufficient. Let's wait until he accumulates 1,000 points of Cultivation Value before looking into it again.

What is most important now is to seize the opportunity bestowed by the Aeterna World and collect as much immortal golden nature as possible to solidify his foundation.

With a majestic and unparalleled foundation, he will have more confidence and choices when condensing Imagery and seeking the Golden Core in the future.

With his goal clear, Xu Yunfan's actions were no longer hesitant.
