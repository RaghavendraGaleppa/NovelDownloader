# Chapter 247: The Venerable One

Li Shimin carefully stored the twenty high-grade 'Eternal Youth Pills' into jade bottles before taking out two for himself and his doppelganger Li Yuanba.  

"It seems our appearances won't change anymore!" he said with a smile before swallowing his pill.  

The pill dissolved into a warm energy that spread across his skin before vanishing without any visible change. Since he was still young and in his prime, the effects weren't immediately noticeable. However, his spiritual sense detected an inexplicable energy merging with his skin—the essence of the pill's preservation.  

"Looks like the face you crafted for me will last forever!" Li Yuanba chuckled, removing his mask before taking his own pill.  

Despite numerous battles in the Senluo Sect, Li Yuanba's peerless beauty remained untouched.  

"Like jade upon the earth, a peerless gentleman under heaven!" Li Shimin couldn't help but marvel at his doppelganger's appearance. Even though he often sensed Li Yuanba's state remotely, seeing him in person still evoked admiration.  

This was his proudest work—a masterpiece of cosmetic refinement. Using IBMz15's calculations of the most aesthetically pleasing features and micron-level precision, combined with a cultivator's regenerative abilities, Li Yuanba's beauty bore no trace of artificial modification.  

Unlike Li Shimin, whose 'Eternal Youth Pill' only preserved his current state due to his 'Flawless Dao Body,' Li Yuanba's skin shimmered with a porcelain-like luster after consumption. His dual nature—human form as pure yang and corpse form as pure yin—allowed the pill to enhance his skin in ways the 'Flawless Dao Body' could not.  

"Hmm?" Li Shimin suddenly frowned, sensing something amiss in the distance.  

His surveillance probe, hidden where he had stored Li Yuanba's pass, transmitted images of three monks—two marked as Arhats of the Thousand Leaves Temple and one unmarked, yet clearly of higher status.  

Just as he observed them, the unmarked monk suddenly looked directly at the probe. The feed went dark instantly.  

Li Shimin wasn't surprised. Even he could detect being watched, so it was no shock that a higher-level cultivator had noticed. However, the fact that the other two Arhats hadn't detected the probe unsettled him.  

"Please don't be a Venerable One," he muttered, glancing at Li Yuanba.  

Had Li Yuanba's use of 'Lotus Steps' drawn the attention of a Venerable from the Thousand Leaves Temple? It seemed absurd—Venerables were Nascent Soul cultivators, the pinnacle of power in the Northern Shu Continent. They wouldn't mobilize for a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, let alone a Golden Core one.  

"My friend, you're in trouble. Time to hide," Li Shimin joked, beckoning Li Yuanba, who sighed and allowed himself to be stored away in the server room space.  

All traces of Li Yuanba vanished—the perfect solution. Li Shimin would transport him directly to the border checkpoint.  

---  

"Venerable Huike, Li Yuanba's pass disappeared here," Arhat Zhiming reported respectfully.  

Huike stood effortlessly in the air, his presence devoid of any spiritual fluctuations, as if the sky itself supported him like solid ground.  

"There are traces of the Divine Foot Technique here. Oddly, two distinct traces," Huike mused, sensing far more than the Arhats could.  

Had Li Shimin's probe not been destroyed, he would have been shocked. Huike, however, assumed Li Yuanba possessed some method of altering his aura rather than considering two individuals mastering the technique.  

"Can we track him?" Zhiming asked.  

"The Divine Foot Technique leaves no trail. Only because he lingered here do we sense remnants," Huike replied dismissively.  

Examining the broken probe, Huike frowned. Despite his vast knowledge, he couldn't decipher its workings beyond a faint communication array.  

"Wait here," he ordered before vanishing, reappearing a mile away with each step—his mastery of the 'Shrinking the World' technique allowing him to cover vast distances swiftly.  

The Thousand Leaves Temple had mobilized Huike precisely because of Li Yuanba's 'Lotus Steps.' With 'Shrinking the World,' Huike could traverse miles in a single stride, far outpacing Li Yuanba.  

Soon, Huike discovered a concealed formation—exactly the kind of hiding place he expected.  

"Amitabha," he intoned before striking the formation with a palm.  

---  

Li Shimin barely had time to react as the formation shattered, its array flags reduced to dust. The unmarked monk—now confirmed as a Venerable—stood before him.  

He swiftly erased all traces of Li Yuanba, stashing any incriminating items in the server room space, leaving only a spatial ring on his finger.  

"Who dares destroy my formation?" Li Shimin demanded, rising defiantly despite the oppressive aura bearing down on him.  

Huike ignored the question, his divine sense confirming Li Shimin's identity as a true disciple of the Shu Mountain Sect.  

"What are you doing here?" Huike countered.  

"Resting. And you destroy my formation to interrogate me?" Li Shimin retorted.  

Huike's patience waned. A crushing weight pressed Li Shimin into the ground up to his waist, blood trickling from his lips.  

"I am Li Shimin, Alchemy True Disciple of the Shu Mountain Sect! Who are you to bully our sect?" he shouted, presenting his identity jade slip, which pulsed with an emergency signal.  

Huike hesitated. Killing a true disciple was one thing, but an alchemy prodigy? That risked igniting a sect war.  

Before he could reconsider, a voice boomed from the jade slip:  

"Venerable Huike, explain why you harass my sect's alchemy disciple, or shall the Shu Mountain and Thousand Leaves Temples go to war?"  

The voice belonged to Elder Fanting, Li Shimin's grandmaster, a figure even Huike couldn't ignore.  

"A misunderstanding," Huike conceded reluctantly. "Compensation will be provided."  

"See that it is, or we settle this on the battlefield," Fanting snapped before cutting the connection.  

Back at the Shu Mountain Sect, Elder Su and others sighed at Li Shimin's uncanny luck—attracting both Golden Core and Nascent Soul adversaries in such short order.  

"Once he returns, he's staying put," Elder Su resolved.  

With Li Shimin's alchemy talents, he could thrive safely within the sect's walls. His adventures outside only courted danger.
