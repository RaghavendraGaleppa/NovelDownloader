Chapter 17: Is Blackmailing Also an Investment?

Divine Armament Peak.

Within the Forging Institute, heat and cold coexisted as the clanging of iron echoed ceaselessly.

He Hongfeng rushed in frantically, blurting out, "Deacon Futu, you must go now! Elder Shang Wu said if she doesn't see you in a quarter of an hour, she'll storm Divine Armament Peak herself."

As his words fell, cold sweat broke out among the bare-chested, muscular men in the forging yard. They seemed to recall unpleasant memories, turning their heads in unison to look at the towering giant of a man nearby.

"Hmm?" Futu's face twitched violently. He let go of his hammer, and it clanged to the ground. "What exactly happened?"

Elder Han He slammed the table and stood up, fuming, "To summon and dismiss my Divine Armament Peak's deacon at will, and even threaten to storm the peak? Are you perhaps implying there's no one in Divine Armament Peak?!"

The burly men lowered their heads, pretending to be busy.

"Uh, Futu, you go first."

"Yes, Elder."

Futu's expression shifted as he walked out of the Forging Institute. Only then did Elder Han He ask with a stern face, "Deacon He, what exactly is going on?"

"Deacon Futu's disciple sparred with the newly promoted true disciple..." He Hongfeng recounted everything that had just transpired.

Elder Han He listened, his temper flaring. For an old disciple to seek a spar with a newly promoted one – such a shameless act! And not only did he do it, but he lost. Now it was truly good. Shang Wu, that fierce individual, could stir up trouble even without reason; now that she had a reason, what would happen?!

"By the way, you just said Li Mo forced Wang Hao to use internal energy?"

"That's right. In fact, Wang Hao had been secretly using it before, but only a trace. He suffered a loss against the grand-accomplished Six Harmonies Fist, which made him furious."

"It's none of your business." Elder Han He stroked his streaked beard, his eyes flickering.

Six Harmonies Fist at grand accomplishment! Opening meridians in a single day! With just these two points, this Li Mo kid, even if not as good as Ying Bing, wasn't far off. The Stairway to Heaven truly never erred. That kid's physique might be manifesting in his martial arts prowess, which is why his progress was so extraordinary. Such a good prospect, yet he ended up under Shang Wu's tutelage. Learning martial arts alone would be fine, but if he were to pick up that madwoman's bad habits... Han He felt a headache just thinking about it.

...

At the Martial Arts Hall.

Futu stepped in, only to see his disciple embedded in the wall, his life unknown, while Shang Wu sat regally in the main seat, drinking tea. He took a deep breath, suppressing his anger. "Elder Shang, what is the meaning of injuring my disciple like this?"

Shang Wu's eyebrows shot up, her voice even louder than his. "He attacked first!" Saying so, she lifted Li Mo's arm and pointed at the bruises on his palm. "If I hadn't arrived in time, my exceptionally gifted precious disciple would have been killed by your disciple."

Li Mo coughed lightly, trying to pull his hand back, but couldn't. *No, Master, these few bruises on my hand are from me hitting him.* *Any later, and they probably would have disappeared on their own.*

Futu reached out with an invisible force, pulling Wang Hao out of the wall. After feeding him a healing pill, he turned back. "It was merely a spar among fellow disciples, Elder Shang Wu, you've gone too far. Wang Hao had the duty to guide new disciples in martial arts; perhaps he was just imparting fist techniques."

"A spar? He used internal energy, is that also guidance?" Shang Wu said, setting down her teacup with a *clack*, her voice resentful. "Xiao Mo, what do our Clear Abyss Sect rules say?"

"Those who harm fellow disciples can be executed on the spot," Li Mo said at the opportune moment.

"Useless! What good are you?!" Futu glared angrily at the unconscious Wang Hao. Bullying a disciple who had joined only yesterday, and still using internal energy? Now it was good, with the label of "harming fellow disciples" placed upon them, he could only swallow the bitterness! Amidst his anger, he subtly glanced at the youth beside Shang Wu. He knew Wang Hao's capabilities; without using internal energy, he actually couldn't take down the other party?

"Then... thank you, Elder Shang, for disciplining my disciple. I'll take my leave." Futu hoisted Wang Hao and intended to leave. But before he had taken two steps, he felt a surge of energy lock onto him, making the hairs on his neck stand on end.

"Your Divine Armament Peak still owes me an explanation." Shang Wu spat her tea leaves back into the cup, a look of utter disdain on her face. "Give me ten thousand catties of Profound Iron, a thousand catties of Crimson Gold, and ten catties of Iron Essence. If there's even one tael short, don't even think about leaving this door."

Everyone present gasped in astonishment. This was equivalent to Divine Armament Peak's output for ten years. Even Elder Han He might not be able to produce it. Visibly, veins bulged on Futu's forehead. "A blatant extortion! Shang Wu, don't go too far!"

"And what if I bully you?!" A scorching aura spread out, making it impossible to breathe. Whether it was an illusion or not, Li Mo vaguely saw a lotus blossoming in fire around his beautiful Master, burning brightly as if eternal.

Futu's momentum stalled. If it were anyone else, he would be certain they wouldn't dare to act in the sect. But when Shang Wu, that madwoman, went berserk, even the Sect Master had to give way.

Li Mo, having a sudden flash of insight, smoothed things over. "Deacon Futu is just an deacon of Divine Armament Peak; he truly cannot produce that much. And I, your disciple, was not actually injured. Perhaps we could... ask for a little less compensation?"

Shang Wu snorted. "That's true, dear disciple. What compensation would satisfy you?"

Li Mo coughed lightly and said, "Bring me pen and ink!" He picked up the brush and swiftly began writing. In a short while, he had penned a list.

Futu took a look. Most of what was written were fine wines Shang Wu loved to drink, along with some miscellaneous precious items. While it still meant a significant expense, it wasn't as outrageous as before.

"You can come to Divine Armament Peak to collect them." Seeing the master and disciple working in tandem, Futu's expression fluctuated between dark and light, ultimately swallowing the silent loss.

"Heh, that's more like it. Why didn't you cooperate earlier?" Shang Wu's intimidating aura instantly dissipated. After Futu snorted and left, she beamed, suddenly giving her precious disciple a big hug, happily burying his head in her chest.

If Li Mo were to describe Shang Wu's figure at this moment, he would say it was suffocating. If asked what Li Mo was thinking at this moment... he was thinking, *no wonder his girlfriends in his previous life would suddenly smack his thigh so hard...*

"As expected of my disciple, you've already learned three-tenths of my skill."

"Master, can I have a share?" Li Mo shyly requested his cut of the spoils.

"Huh?" Shang Wu instantly became alert, looking at her precious disciple not as a loving child anymore.

"Nine-to-one." The beautiful Master held up a finger.

"Master, you only want that much?"

"One-tenth is yours, nine-tenths is my share."

Li Mo helplessly said, "Actually, I just want some exotic beast meat, to roast and eat..."

"Roast meat?" Shang Wu's almond eyes lit up slightly. "You can cook too?"

"Of course! In Ziyang Prefecture, if I say I'm first, no one dares to say they're second." With modern seasonings in hand, he was that confident!

No sooner had he spoken than he felt himself being picked up. Then, the surrounding scenery began to blur and recede rapidly. Just as Li Mo was about to feel nauseous, his feet touched solid ground.

Where was this? Hearing the clang of metal, student Li looked around with a bewildered expression. Before his eyes was a massive cave, within which cold light faintly gleamed. On the left and right sides of the cave, there were two rivers: one extremely hot, the other bone-chillingly cold, each channeled into the yard by an aqueduct. A group of blacksmiths toiled in this yard.

"This is..."

"That's the Divine Edge Cave. It existed even before our Clear Abyss Sect was founded." Shang Wu was in a good mood and happy to explain a few things to her new disciple. "There's a pile of broken metal in there. I killed a killer from the Misty Rain Tower back then, and his sword was thrown in there. Old man Han He said something about it being nourished by the sharp qi of slain weapons."

Sharp qi of slain weapons? Li Mo's heart stirred. Wouldn't this Divine Edge Cave be a great place to cultivate the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body?

"Hmph, those are not broken metal. Shang Wu, don't be disrespectful to my Divine Armament Peak's ancestors!" Elder Han He stood with his hands behind his back, his face filled with displeasure.

Shang Wu didn't bother with idle talk, extending a hand. "Where are the things?"

"Hmph, Futu!" As his words fell, Futu dragged out a carriage.

Li Mo surmised that this was probably prepared so quickly because one of the deacons named Futu had already appropriated it from Divine Armament Peak. These were all things Master had instructed him to ask for. It seemed she had long planned this, picking only what could be produced...

Shang Wu narrowed her beautiful almond eyes, smiling like a fox that had successfully stolen a fish. "Old ghost Han He, it's rare for you to be so straightforward. Alright, this matter is settled."

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing, acting as an accomplice for Shang Wu, and completing an extortion.】
【Investment Feedback: Three jars of Icefire Wine.】
【Investment Feedback: Two bottles of Six-Pattern Heart-Cleansing Pills.】
【Investment Feedback: Ten catties of Iron Essence.】
...

【Heart-Cleansing Pill: Has the effect of calming the mind and tranquilizing the spirit, capable of suppressing distracting thoughts to a certain extent. Each pill can last for two hours, with a maximum of one pill per day. Excessive consumption will lead to dulling of emotions and desires, causing loss of humanity.】
【Iron Essence: Ten thousand catties of iron, one tael of essence. Ordinary weapons, with a trace added, can cut hair and sever metal. It is an essential material for forging divine weapons and sharp tools.】

Student Li was also very happy. He hadn't expected that helping his Master extort someone could be considered an investment. It was a huge payoff. Perhaps this wasn't his best reward, but it was definitely the most bountiful. The value of the rewards far exceeded the sum Master had painstakingly extorted.

"Heh, how could this old man lose both face and the bet?" Elder Han He snorted. He was referring to the bet they had made about their disciples. The stakes for that bet were far more valuable than this mere carriage of goods; no, they couldn't even be measured in gold or silver.

"Then I'll give you a chance... to lose." Shang Wu smiled, giving a thumbs down.

Li Mo: "..." *Master, where do you get such confidence?* If he remembered correctly, Murong Xiao possessed the Roaring Flood Dragon Physique and was known as a rare genius in Ziyang Prefecture, seen only once every decade. If not for Ying Bing, Murong Xiao would undoubtedly be the top disciple of this generation. Elder Han He's confidence probably stemmed from that half-demon bloodline. The characteristic of half-demons was an extremely high starting point.

"Heh, my disciple is not very talented, but at Blood Qi Realm, Five Meridians, he can already go down to the second level of the Divine Edge Cave." Elder Han He took a sip of tea nonchalantly. "It's regrettable, truly regrettable, just a little bit better than this old man in his youth, surpassing him."

Shang Wu was uncharacteristically surprised. "He's only at Blood Qi Realm, Five Meridians, and you're already sending him to cultivate in the Divine Edge Cave?"

A mysterious smile appeared on Han He's lips. "This old man has his own plans; there's no need for you to worry." His disciple possessed a half-demon physique, and his bloodline leaned towards the flood dragon, known for its powerful physical body. Under his guidance, he had also cultivated body tempering, fully leveraging his strengths. Now, with just his physical body, he could lift a ten-thousand-catty boulder. Li Mo might go far in the future, but so what? The Nine Peaks Martial Arts Gathering was imminent. In the short term, he couldn't possibly defeat Murong Xiao.

"Hmph, isn't it just entering the Divine Edge Cave..." Shang Wu pouted, but ultimately held back from blurting out, "My disciple can too." The weapons in the cave were all instruments of slaughter. Individually, they might not be much, but if gathered systematically, they could harm people from a distance. Moreover, some weapons had killed countless people and carried astonishing murderous intent, enough to intimidate the soul. Entering the cave was a dual test of both body and mind. Even she couldn't reach the deepest level of the Divine Edge Cave.

"Elder Han He, may I ask if outsiders can enter this Divine Edge Cave?"

"Hmm?" Han He paused his tea-drinking. Shang Wu also subtly winked at her disciple. *Silly disciple, we don't have to argue over everything...*

Han He's gaze swept over. "Of course, you can enter, but I advise you to think twice." Apart from Murong Xiao, everyone in the cave was a disciple at or above the Internal Energy Realm. The former was due to his innate powerful physical body, while the latter could use internal energy to protect themselves.

"I'll try the outer perimeter first. If it's too much, I won't push myself," Li Mo said, his eyes gleaming, speaking to both of them.

Han He shook his head inwardly. *No wonder he got into a conflict as soon as he entered the Martial Arts Hall. He's made a little progress in martial arts and now doesn't know his limits, always wanting to compete. It might do him good to suffer a little hardship to temper his character.*

"You may enter, but you are responsible for your own safety. If anything happens, don't blame it on your master and disciple duo."

"Thank you." Li Mo cupped his hands, then looked at his Master.

Shang Wu narrowed her almond eyes and pondered for a moment, then took out a small bell from her bosom. "If you can't hold on, shake it vigorously twice." This was a Concentric Bell. If one bell was shaken vigorously, the other would ring. It worked as long as they weren't thousands of miles apart. Elder Shang, though seemingly carefree, still didn't want her precious disciple to get truly hurt.

"Thank you, Master."

After receiving the bell, Li Mo walked towards the entrance of the Divine Edge Cave.
