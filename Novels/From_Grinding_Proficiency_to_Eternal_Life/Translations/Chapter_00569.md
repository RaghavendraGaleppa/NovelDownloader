# Chapter 569: The Nine Heavens Five Thunders Yin-Yang Chaos God-Covering Evil-Arraying Formation

The young Divine General before him, though bearing the title of Heavenly General and calling himself an immortal, possessed strength comparable only to the early Foundation Establishment realm within the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

Empowered by the Word of Strife Incantation, the Golden Cleaving Sword Qi's power surged exponentially, and it possessed a natural suppressing effect against Nezha's fire arts.

The two clashed once more. In the span of a few flashes of lightning, they exchanged dozens of blows, spears meeting swords, thunder and fire colliding.

Relying on the supreme explosive power granted by the Word of Strife Incantation, the precise control enhanced by his Divine Sense, and the peerless sharpness of the True Martial Sword, Xu Yunfan fought with effortless ease, even finding the spare capacity to observe the surrounding battlefield.

Although Nezha possessed miraculous treasures, unmatched divine strength, and swift movement techniques, against Xu Yunfan's unpredictable, ever-changing sword arts that moved like a corner-hanging antelope and his formidable protective thunder aura, he gradually revealed signs of impatience.

Not only was his opponent's attack sharp, but his defense was also watertight. The layer of thunderlight over his body seemed like an indestructible bedrock.

"I cannot delay. Those Heavenly Soldiers won't last much longer."

Xu Yunfan's Divine Sense swept across the battlefield. Although the Qi Condensation disciples had suffered heavy losses, with nearly half of them killed, the survivors were all desperate madmen stimulated by the scent of blood.

In contrast, the Heavenly Soldiers, despite their formation's resilience, were being continuously torn apart and cut off by the myriad bizarre and vicious demonic arts of the Primordial Origin Sect. Their immortal light dimmed, and their casualties were also severe.

The seven Foundation Establishment True Lords were also tightly entangling their respective Heavenly General opponents, holding the advantage in either cultivation realm or martial arts techniques. Two of the Heavenly Generals were already on the verge of collapse.

It was hard to imagine that a foreign world could harbor such powerful enemies.

The Heavenly Emperor's plan seemed to have gone awry.

The Taihua Spirit Ruins World was not as weak as they had imagined.

After observing the battlefield once over, Xu Yunfan's heart immediately understood that although each of the Primordial Origin Sect's elite Qi Condensation experts could fight ten men, their numbers were ultimately insufficient.

He had to end this battle quickly.

He needed to completely shatter the enemy's morale and, more importantly, intimidate any potential subsequent counterattacks from the Heavenly Realm.

A fierce light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes.

After once again forcing Nezha's Fire-tipped Spear back with his Golden Cleaving Sword Qi, he did not pursue the attack. Instead, his left hand shot to the Spatial Bag at his waist!

*Hum!*

He boldly took out a palm-sized array disc, its texture neither gold nor jade, and its entire surface inscribed with countless fine thunder runes.

This was a mobile array disc he had refined himself.

Possessing the Profound Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Scripture and being a master of array formations, refining a mobile array disc was not difficult for him.

"Nine Heavies Supreme, Five Thunders Strike from Above! Array, Rise!"

Xu Yunfan chanted the true incantation and slammed his palm into the void.

The unremarkable array disc instantly flew from his hand, transforming into a streak of lightning that shot straight into the high sky.

*BOOM-CRACK!*

The heavens changed in an instant!

Above the clouds already shattered by the Foundation Establishment battle, even thicker and more oppressive leaden clouds appeared out of thin air, layer upon layer, like a celestial dome pressing down.

Countless massive, mountain-sized serpents of thunder—in玄 black, violet-gold, cyan-white, crimson, and bright yellow—frenetically swam and coalesced within the black clouds.

A destructive heavenly might that caused all living things to tremble and souls to freeze descended violently.

Within a ten-mile radius, all battling creatures—whether disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect or Heavenly Soldiers and Generals of the Heavenly Realm, and even the Foundation Establishment True Lords and Heavenly Generals—felt their bodies suddenly grow heavy, as if bearing a mountain of ten thousand jun. The spiritual power within their bodies became sluggish.

This was one of Xu Yunfan's trump card killing formations.

The Nine Heavens Five Thunders Yin-Yang Chaos God-Covering Evil-Arraying Formation!

This formation relied on the thunder art origin of the Divine Thunder Nine Firmaments Supreme Void Indestructible Scripture, using the array disc to draw upon the most violent Five Element Thunders of the heavens and earth. It contained multiple tyrannical and unparalleled powers, such as breaking evil, slaying gods, covering evil, striking bodies, and disrupting the Five Elements.

The speed at which Xu Yunfan deployed the formation, thanks to the infinite deduction and comprehension granted by his attribute panel, had long since reached a miraculous level.

"What?!"

Nezha, being at the epicenter, was the first to bear the brunt. The flames of his Wind-fire Wheels were suppressed by the invisible heavenly might, flickering violently. His unruly aura was firmly locked within the center of the array.

He looked up at the sky, sensing the terrifying thunder power accumulating in the clouds, enough to obliterate any Foundation Establishment existence, and for the first time, his face showed shock.

That demon!

He could not only fight, but his array deployment was also this fast?!

Without a moment's hesitation, Nezha let out a clear cry, holding nothing back.

"Evil creature! How dare you commit such a slaughter! Dharma Form, Heaven and Earth Manifestation! Three Heads, Six Arms, Appear!!!"

A more violent aura than before erupted from Nezha's small body.

Brilliant, dazzling divine light swallowed him in an instant.

When the divine light faded, where was the handsome youth?

There stood a figure sixteen feet tall, with a youth's face twisted in wrath, bearing three heads: one in a wrathful countenance, one calm, and one compassionate. Sinews on the back of his neck coiled like dragons.

Six mighty arms grew from his shoulders, each holding a treasure.

Besides the original Fire-tipped Spear, Universe Ring, and Red Cincture, three more treasures were in his hands: the Golden Light File, the Primordial Sword, and the Demon-subduing Pestle.

Six arms danced, treasure light soaring to the heavens. Three faces looked in all directions, divine might awe-inspiring.

Dharma Form, Heaven and Earth Manifestation!

Three Heads, Six Arms!

This was the true form of battle!

The terrifying pressure, like a tangible tsunami, crushed down upon Xu Yunfan at the array's core.

Xu Yunfan felt the world before him change abruptly, as if locked onto by three deities simultaneously. The six directions—front, back, left, right, up, down—were all covered by that boundless divine power aura.

His gaze was profound as he looked at the Three-Headed, Six-Armed Nezha, who was only six zhang tall, and felt a bit of surprise.

"You call that a Dharma Form, Heaven and Earth Manifestation?"

"Die!"

Three heads roared in unison, the sound shaking the four fields.

Six treasures unleashed light capable of destroying heaven and earth, weaving into a net of destruction with no blind spots, sealing the heavens and cutting off the earth, and ruthlessly enveloped Xu Yunfan.

The Fire-tipped Spear pierced the void, aiming for his head.

The Universe Ring howled towards his Dantian. The Golden Light File slashed at his waist. The Primordial Sword broke through his chest. The Demon-subduing Pestle smashed down on his crown. The Red Cincture transformed into a ten-thousand-zhang red glow, attempting to bind and entangle him.

The treasures' divine powers attacked from six sides.

The might was far greater than before, by a factor of ten.

In an instant, it even suppressed the majestic heavenly might凝聚ed by the Nine Heavens Five Thunders Yin-Yang Chaos God-Covering Evil-Arraying Formation by a fraction.

Xu Yunfan's entire body, wreathed in thunderlight, was almost extinguished by these six layers of treasure light.

His expression remained indifferent. Only the Word of Strife Incantation, his innate divine power, ran wild within him, his blood and Qi boiling like molten magma under the immense pressure.

This single blow was enough to obliterate any early Foundation Establishment cultivator and could even threaten some unstable mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Unfortunately, that was all it was.

"Good, now this is more like it."

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted to their limit, yet within them erupted an even more blazing purple thunder light.

He did not feel a shred of fear. Instead, a violent, bloodthirsty killing intent, completely provoked, rose within him.

Facing Nezha's ultimate, life-force-exhausting killing blow, all his thoughts were instantly discarded.

His eyes held only thunder, his ears only the roar.

Within his body, the core thunder incantation of the Divine Thunder Nine Firmaments Supreme Void Indestructible Scripture was pushed to a limit never before seen.

His Dantian's Qi Sea was like a singularity at the birth of the universe. The immense thunder elemental spiritual power was instantly compressed and condensed, then erupted.

"Supreme Scripture of the Void, All Thunders Submit! Nine Firmaments Divine Thunder, All Realms Defer!给我，破!!!" (Give me, Break!!!)

Xu Yunfan chanted the incantation. The sound from his mouth was calm, but by the time it reached three zhang away, it suddenly expanded, erupting like the roar of an ancient Thunder God.
