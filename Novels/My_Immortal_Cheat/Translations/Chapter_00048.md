# Chapter 48: Grand Figures Gather

“This should be something that divine soul extracted from its own memories. Zi Xu probably didn’t know at first that the divine soul could do this. His final silence was likely him questioning the divine soul on his person. If he had known from the beginning, he would have induced the other party to say more disrespectful things.” Uncle Zhou said.

“Hmm…” Zhou Tian nodded and continued, “Uncle Zhou, can you alter the words spoken by those people in the projection?”

“I can, but such alterations can easily be seen through by someone with profound cultivation,” Uncle Zhou replied. Such a small trick was no challenge for someone of his cultivation, but it held little significance, as it would be easily detected once the projection array was activated.

“It’s fine. Just change the words ‘severely injure’ spoken by the person from Daluo Academy to ‘kill’!” Zhou Tian instructed.

“Alright.” Uncle Zhou nodded. Although he didn’t know what his young master intended, since the young master had instructed it, he would simply do it.

The jade slip once again scattered into a sky full of runic formations. Uncle Zhou waved his hand, and countless runes blossomed, intertwining into chains of symbols. The projection array flickered incessantly.

A moment later, the projection array reformed into a jade slip. Uncle Zhou gently tapped it, a rainbow light flashed, and the projection reappeared.

“…help us kill her!”

The words spoken by the person from Daluo Academy had been tampered with. From the projection, it appeared seamless. Zhou Tian nodded in satisfaction.

“Young Master, this change is merely superficial. If the projection array is opened, it will be seen through instantly, so it’s best not to treat it as crucial evidence,” Uncle Zhou warned, still concerned. Such a tactic was not suitable for public display and might even backfire if presented.

“I know. I’m just using this to bluff them, not as actual evidence.” Zhou Tian understood. Causing Tian Ling to be injured and causing her death were fundamentally different concepts. After all, Tian Ling had been granted a marriage by Emperor Qin, and the imperial decree had been announced to the world. If her life wasn’t at stake, things could be debated and spun. But if something truly happened, it would require bloodshed to resolve.

By the time the matter was concluded, it was already evening. Uncle Zhou bowed and took his leave. However, just as he was about to exit Zhou Tian’s room, Zhou Tian seemed to suddenly remember something and asked, “Uncle Zhou, what realm are you in?”

Uncle Zhou paused slightly, stopping his steps. He lowered his head slightly, his white temples hanging by his ears. His voice, devoid of much emotional fluctuation, respectfully replied, “Reporting to Young Master, I am merely at the Great Emperor Realm.”

With that, he slowly retreated and closed the door.

Zhou Tian didn’t know what expression he should wear. This old man with a weathered face was a Great Emperor? No wonder he spoke with such authority, truly having the right to say, “He’s just a Saint King.” Zhou Tian’s face was filled with a bitter smile; this would make him lose all desire to strive.

Pushing the door open, he stepped out. The sky full of stars cast down shimmering silver light. Looking up, Zhou Tian gazed at the glittering points of light in the sky. Through these past few days of understanding, Zhou Tian had learned that these sparkling objects in the sky were not "stars," but rather a grand formation jointly laid out by the Eight Provinces, covering the entire Nine Provinces. Those "stars" were individual formation nodes, and the smooth, jade-like moon in the sky was the core of the formation, also an extremely powerful magical artifact. This truly was an incredibly magnificent world. Zhou Tian looked up at the sky, his purple robe with dragon patterns and golden clouds making him appear like a brilliant star.

Time flew by in a flash. Things were developing steadily. Tian Ling, relying on her formidable combat skills and… the sacred artifact in her hand, toughly pushed her way into the top eight. Although she also encountered someone bearing a sacred artifact, the sacred artifact Zhou Ying had given Tian Ling was clearly superior among sacred artifacts. Under the same cultivation level, that person was no match for Tian Ling and was defeated.

Among the few individuals arranged by Daluo Academy, one also entered the top eight. This person had been incredibly valiant recently, as if he had taken an aphrodisiac, continuously breaking through from the Heavenly Repository Realm to the Human Repository Realm. Wielding a blade-shaped sacred artifact, he struck fear into countless opponents, becoming a dark horse in the Youth Grand Competition and drawing widespread attention.

In the blink of an eye, five days had passed. This day was the first match of the top eight into the top four, and it was also when Tian Ling would face the individual arranged by Daluo Academy. The match was scheduled for noon. Zhou Tian and Tian Ling had breakfast and headed to the competition venue early.

“Are you confident?” In the carriage, Zhou Tian looked at Tian Ling, who was brimming with fighting spirit. To facilitate combat today, she had changed into a lighter, pale-green robe that emanated a soft glow, clearly not an ordinary item, giving her an inexplicable heroic aura.

“Yes!” Tian Ling said resolutely, completely unlike her usual gentle and soft demeanor. Her bright eyes were full of radiant divine light. Zhou Tian had seen this brilliance many times in the past few days; it was her anticipation for battle, which left Zhou Tian speechless. He wondered what on earth this girl was thinking.

The carriage slowly moved along the road. Zhou Tian’s eyes were deep. The arrangements of the past few days were all for today. People always had to pay for their actions! Meanwhile, Tian Ling was puzzled, constantly stealing glances at Zhou Tian. Her eyes, like autumn waters, sparkled. *Sigh… why is something off today? Why isn’t Zhou Tian trying every trick to take advantage of her? It’s a little… unfamiliar.*

Before long, they arrived at the competition venue. Compared to the previous days, the scene was even more bustling. Not only were there local residents of the Imperial Capital, but many also came from other parts of Futian Province.

“Quite a lot of people here today,” Zhou Tian remarked as he stepped out of the carriage, noticing several familiar carriages parked where theirs was.

“The Great General of the Western Frontier, the Great General of the Southern Frontier… Good heavens… All four Great Generals of the Frontiers are here, the Imperial Advisor is here, and Prime Minister Liu is also here…” Zhou Tian counted, realizing that several high-ranking imperial officials had already arrived, and more might still be coming. He figured that today truly was a gathering of grand figures. Perhaps all the previous matches of the Youth Grand Competition combined didn’t attract as many important people as today.

“Zhou Tian, why are there so many grand figures today?” Tian Ling asked, also a little surprised. Having stayed in the Imperial Capital for a long time, she had a good grasp of things. In a place where a single sword strike could slay a string of imperial court officials, there weren’t many things that could pique the interest of these grand figures at the pinnacle of Tianqin. Even the quadrennial Futian Province Youth Grand Competition, a grand event involving the entire young generation of Futian Province, they had witnessed countless times in their long lives. No matter how dazzling or brilliant the prodigies, they had seen them all, but only a handful ever grew to their level, making it unnecessary to pay much attention to such competitions.

“Who knows? Maybe they want to see my Ling’er’s exceptionally skilled combat,” Zhou Tian said, patting Tian Ling’s head and chuckling. These old fellows truly had nothing better to do but come watch the spectacle.
