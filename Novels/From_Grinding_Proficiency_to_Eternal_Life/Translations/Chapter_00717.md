# Chapter 717: Setting Up Again

The feeling of surviving a calamity brought little joy. Han Shi’s heart was filled only with icy numbness and a deeper fear of Xu Yunfan, but this was quickly replaced by surging rage and gradually reviving thoughts.

This place was far from the Taihua Spirit Ruins World; there should be a way to break free from Xu Yunfan’s control.

He lowered his head to look at the Unfated Mirror in his hand, which remained intact and still emitted a clear halo, remaining silent.

Just then, Xu Yunfan’s cold, emotionless divine sense command rang out directly in his mind.

“Qiu Long’s position: three hundred miles southeast, on the White Bone Island. Approach it, but remain concealed. Investigate the surrounding environment and beware of tricks.”

Han Shi did not hesitate in the slightest, temporarily suppressing all the thoughts in his heart—or rather, he had long since lost the ability to hesitate.

According to Xu Yunfan, this Unfated Mirror was a ticking time bomb. Should he resist, the Mirror would naturally take his life.

Yet, he was still secretly alarmed that Xu Yunfan could transmit information across realms.

Such capability—even a Golden Core True Lord would find it difficult to transmit information across realms.

Could the Cloud Sutra Avatar Technique truly be so marvelous?

While pondering this, he followed the instructions and pressed the Unfated Mirror into his chest. The ancient mirror’s clear light converged inward, perfectly concealing the fluctuations of his living aura and blending him into the silent backdrop of this netherland.

His figure flickered, transforming into a shadow that almost merged with the gloomy background. Following the coastline of the blood sea, he raced toward the direction Xu Yunfan indicated.

The speed and concealment of his先天 Sword Body were brought into full play at this moment.

Soon, the White Bone Island, piled up from countless giant skeletons and radiating a terrifying pressure, appeared at the end of his vision.

However, when Han Shi—or rather, Xu Yunfan, who was monitoring him—saw the situation on the island, a strong sense of vigilance arose in their hearts.

The Sea Suffering Qiu Long, which had once fought against the Profound True Lord and the White-Haired True Lord and possessed terrifying might, was currently coiled beneath the gnarled, strange tree at the highest point of the White Bone Island.

But its condition was exceptionally wretched.

The thousand-zhang skeletal dragon body was covered in huge tearing wounds, with bone stubs exposed in many places, flashing with dim luster.

The eye sockets that originally burned with raging blood flames now had dim light, as if they might extinguish at any moment.

Its aura was even more withered and weak, far from the dominance of a Golden Core monster it once was. It even gave the feeling of a lamp running out of oil, a bolt at the end of its flight.

That crucial Taiyin Nether Qiu Dao Fruit still hung on the branch of the strange tree, emitting a cold, clear halo, seemingly within easy reach.

This scene was too abnormal.

A Golden Core Sea Suffering overlord, one that was accompanied by the Dao Fruit, how could it be so severely injured in such a short time?

Xu Yunfan absolutely did not believe this was due to natural decline or the recurrence of old injuries.

He instantly thought of the White-Haired True Lord, who was hidden and traceless and adept in the secret arts of the cycle of life and death.

This was very likely a carefully laid trap.

Using the severely injured, dying Qiu Long and the Dao Fruit within reach as bait to lure those who coveted it.

Or perhaps this was intentional on the part of the Qiu Long itself.

Facing a monster evolved from such a Dao Fruit, Xu Yunfan absolutely did not believe the other party’s recovery ability was weak. Moreover, this Sea Suffering was the other party’s home ground.

“Stop advancing, maintain maximum distance for observation.”

Xu Yunfan’s divine sense command carried extreme caution.

“Circle the area three hundred miles outside the White Bone Island, stealthily investigate if there are hidden formations or traps, or residual special energy.

Pay special attention to any abnormal fluctuations of life and death reversal or the rhythm of reincarnation. These fluctuations are similar to the Unfated Mirror; you should be able to sense them clearly.”

Han Shi stopped as instructed, suppressing the instinctive thought of opportunity that arose from seeing the Qiu Long’s wretched state and the Dao Fruit. He fully activated the stealth secret technique Xu Yunfan had taught him, silently shuttling through the churning blood waves and the shadows of jagged reefs.

His powerful Sword Cultivator’s spiritual perception was excellent for sensing such dangers, like the most precise radar, scanning every inch of suspicious space.

“No fluctuations of obvious formation nodes were discovered, nor did I perceive powerful life or soul fluctuations other than the Qiu Long. The concentration of death qi here is distributed almost the same as in other areas of the Sea Suffering.”

Han Shi fed back the investigation results through the soul link.

But he also added a point.

“One hundred miles southwest of the White Bone Island, in a reef area, the residual fluctuations of life and death spiritual power are exceptionally pure. It is suspected to be a trace of recent man-made spell casting, but there are no subsequent clues. I cannot find where it went.”

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes in the Divine Thunder Palace, not taking this to heart.

The White-Haired True Lord was indeed skilled in concealment and using the situation to set up plans; this leftover spiritual power was definitely intentional.

Beneath this seemingly safe appearance, there must be a fatal trap lurking.

Xu Yunfan naturally would not easily let Han Shi take a risk and step into the possible core trap directly.

After all, once inside, if the avatar Han Shi died, his arrangement for the Taiyin Qiu Long Dao Fruit would be completely stalled for a considerable amount of time.

“First, follow my commands.”

Xu Yunfan issued new instructions, and Han Shi naturally had to comply. He had the heart to resist, but sensing a faint threat, he did not dare to make any extra moves for the time being.

“Take out the formation flags I gave you. According to the star positions, choose seven locations with relatively stable space nodes and fewer death qi vortices to place them around the White Bone Island, five hundred miles out.

When setting them up, be sure to remain hidden, and immediately distance yourself after activating them.”

Han Shi immediately took out ninety-nine palm-sized, entirely black triangular small flags from his storage artifact. These seemed to absorb all light.

These were precisely the formation flags Xu Yunfan had specifically refined for this operation during the three years of exploring the Sea Suffering, combining the secrets of the Primordial Origin Sect’s formation arts with his own understanding of space and Yin Evil. They were called Shadow Concealing Flags, primarily for concealment, confusing the enemy, and briefly disturbing space.

They were highly effective for obtaining the Taiyin Qiu Long Dao Fruit.

His figure moved like lightning, guided by Xu Yunfan’s precise divine sense, quickly moving through the sky above the blood sea or between reef crevices.

Each stop was extremely brief. With fingers flying, one black small flag after another was accurately inserted into the space nodes Xu Yunfan had calculated.

Once the formation flags were thrown out, they were like drops of water merging into the sea, instantly blending with the surrounding environment and disappearing without a trace, without even causing a ripple.

With the ninety-nine formation flags set, Han Shi did not linger and immediately fled far away.

He did not want to die either.

The Sea of Suffering was bizarre and unusual below. The blood sea below carried countless ghosts and skeletons, making a chill rise from the bottom of his heart just looking at it.

Moreover, there was the Netherworld, dormant like a divine mountain at the end of his vision.

This was the world of the dead; the longer one stayed, the greater the danger.

If possible, he naturally did not want to make any moves.

Finally, Xu Yunfan ordered Han Shi to a position above a huge blood sea vortex about eight hundred miles from the White Bone Island.

Here, the death qi churned violently, forming a natural chaotic barrier.

“Take out the Yin Mist Qi.”

Xu Yunfan issued instructions methodically.

Han Shi took out a gray, constantly churning fog ball that emitted a pure Netherworld aura as instructed.
