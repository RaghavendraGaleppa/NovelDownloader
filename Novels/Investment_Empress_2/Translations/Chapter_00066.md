# Chapter 66: One Blade of Grass, Slaying All Suns, Moons, and Stars! Li Mo: "What Did She Comprehend This Time?"

At the moment when Ice Cube had no idea how she could possibly lose...

Inside the room.

Li Mo took the text he had just transcribed, polished it slightly, and added his own summary from earlier.

After finishing everything, he looked at the paper, and four words echoed in his mind:

"Skill Approaching the Way."

"For others, this might be a dead end with no visible finish line."

The night breeze was gentle, causing the candlelight to flicker slightly in Li Mo's pupils.

Having spent so much time with Princess Jiang Chulong and Ice Cube, he deeply understood one thing.

Those bearing the Mandate of Heaven possess unparalleled talent and walk paths that are far from ordinary.

The ordinary path is far too long.

But for a 'commoner' like him, it is the only way out.

The difference is that, thanks to his Martial Dao Epiphanies, he can ride a rocket forward on this ordinary path.

"Whenever I have extra Martial Dao Epiphanies in the future, I'll invest them in the Way of the Sword."

Li Mo's thoughts churned.

Naturally, he must focus primarily on the Hammer Art; that goes without saying.

Besides the Hammer Art, there are movement techniques, mental techniques, and physical tempering.

Only after reaching the pinnacle of his current realm in these areas can he consider the Way of the Sword.

After all, the two Fated Fates around him are both unrivaled geniuses in the Way of the Sword.

It would be a waste not to learn from them.

Besides, if he remains a Sword Dao novice forever, it would be awkward to interact with them.

"Speaking of Martial Dao Epiphanies..."

"How many do I have now?"

Li Mo checked.

Martial Dao Epiphanies Balance: 71 years.

For the Hammer Art, this is a lot.

For the Sword Art, it is too little.

This is a story of mixed joy and sorrow.

After thinking for a moment.

Li Mo decided: "Let's open the rewards first."

Investing in Princess Jiang Chulong and the recent Dao discussion with Ying Bing had both brought him a reward.

*I am not a Sword Dao genius, just a transporter of truth.*

*Then, I make a tiny profit from the middle...*

**[Congratulations, Host. You discussed the Dao with 'Ying Bing' and provided a summary for her Sword Dao theory.]**
**[Investment Feedback: 60 years of Martial Dao Epiphanies.]**

**[Congratulations, Host. You helped 'Jiang Chulong' recover her body and repair her foundation.]**
**[Investment Feedback: One bottle of Earth Vein Spiritual Milk (Ten Thousand Year Vintage).]**

**[Ten Thousand Year Earth Vein Spiritual Milk]:** "Consuming a single drop can increase a mortal's lifespan by twenty years, rendering them immune to all poisons and free from illness, while greatly increasing their strength. It is a material for crafting Life-Extension Pills and a supreme treasure for tempering Qi and Blood."

Ice Cube is truly Ice Cube.

Martial Dao Epiphanies, a burst of sixty years.

In the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, many mortals don't even live to be sixty.

Princess Jiang Chulong didn't disappoint him either.

Ten Thousand Year Earth Vein Spiritual Milk—this was a treasure Li Mo had never heard of.

Perhaps it appeared in the Eastern Wilderness Domain before, but news of it rarely spreads.

After all, regarding life-extending items, whoever obtains them usually uses them immediately.

Which of the two is more precious?

Li Mo believes that in the System's definition, they are roughly equal.

Ying Bing's Mandate Heaven Level is higher, but the discussion they just had didn't actually help her much; it was better than nothing, but barely.

The pill he invested in, however, allowed Jiang Chulong to recover her injuries and repair her foundation.

Ten Thousand Year Earth Vein Spiritual Milk...

"I was just worrying that the speed of condensing my meridians is getting slower and slower."

"Ordinary Earth Vein Spiritual Milk has little effect on me now."

Li Mo hadn't expected that after the Twenty-Four Meridians, condensing meridians became hellishly difficult.

Even maintaining the state of Man and Nature at all times, the speed is no better than a turtle's crawl.

"If the Xuanpin Immortal Body appeared on someone else, it would be a huge pit."

"Breaking through to the Blood Qi Realm would take who knows how many years."

Li Mo opened the jade bottle. Pure Earth Vein Essence Qi rushed at him.

To avoid damaging the room.

He slipped out in the dark and arrived at the waterfall not far from Autumn Water Pavilion.

First, he dug a bathtub-sized pool and filled it with water, then dropped a single drop of the Ten Thousand Year Earth Vein Spiritual Milk into it.

Then he picked up the bottle.

A little taste~

System出品，必屬精品 (System product, must be high quality).

Ninety-nine percent pure, a rare treasure~

External use plus internal consumption, the effect hits instantly.

"I hope my Inner Breath Realm lives up to this hardship..."

Li Mo stepped into the pool.

.........

The next day.

Inside the World Seed.

"The Way of the Sword is nothing more than three realms."

"The first realm is Sword Technique and Sword Art..."

The Primordial Heavenly Lord was lecturing.

Jiang Chulong was still wearing those tattered clothes, though they had been washed clean, and her little face was no longer covered in dirt.

She sat obediently at the table, her two small hands stacked together, her gray-white eyes shining with brilliance.

---

The Heavenly Lord's teaching style was vivid and lifelike.

He didn't just speak; he accompanied it with gestures and sound effects.

"The second realm is having no sword in hand, but a sword in the heart."

"There is Sword Qi in the chest, Sword Intent in the heart, and by borrowing the great momentum of heaven and earth, then, one blade of grass can slay all suns, moons, and stars!"

His voice was heart-shaking.

Plain and calm, yet revealing infinite domineering power!

"One blade of grass, slaying all suns, moons, and stars?!"

Jiang Chulong's small mouth opened slightly.

Historical records stated that of the three suns in the sky, two were transformed by ancestors of the Yu Dynasty, including the Great Yu's Grand Ancestor Martial Emperor.

They were all figures who suppressed their era and proved themselves invincible.

Could they... be extinguished by a small grass?

This was... truly beyond her imagination.

"Hehehe..."

The teacher seemed to notice the doubt in her eyes and let out a light laugh.

With a casual wave of his hand, a blade of grass appeared from nowhere,夹在 (clamped) between his fingers.

With a gentle wave.

Infinite Sword Qi tore through the heavens.

A shocking Sword Intent shattered the star river.

Even a一丝一毫 (trace) could sweep away all things.

That Sword Intent, Sword Qi, and Sword Momentum were all reflected in Jiang Chulong's gray-white eyes.

Including herself, not even Li Mo noticed.

In her heart, something was growing wildly like wild grass...

"As for the third realm..."

.....

One incense stick's worth of time later, the Heavenly Lord's Sword Dao mini-class ended.

"Believing in your comprehension, you should have understood everything."

"Mm mm! Teacher is so amazing..."

Jiang Chulong clapped her small hands, her dirty little face full of worship.

The things she originally didn't know how to name, or understood vaguely, were actually called Sword Qi, Sword Momentum, and Sword Intent?

But... grass and trees slaying stars?

Even she hadn't imagined that those things could achieve such a step!

But since the teacher said it could, then it definitely can!

It's just that she is too weak now, and her understanding of the Sword Dao isn't deep enough...

.....

Ziyang Prefecture City.

"One blade of grass, slaying all suns, moons, and stars!"

Mud Corner Alley.

The calm and domineering words echoed in her ears.

Jiang Chulong woke up slowly. The boundless Sword Intent seemed to have not yet dispersed from her eyes.

She smeared mud on her face again and wrapped a strip of cloth over her eyes.

Picking up a withered branch on the ground, she began to practice alone in the courtyard.

She wanted to become stronger...

For her mother.

To not let the teacher down...

*Swish—*

With her thin arms holding the gnarled withered branch, and her face full of seriousness, an onlooker might think she was just a little beggar playing around.

However.

The weeds and leaves in the dilapidated courtyard began to move without wind.

......

Clear Abyss Sect.

Li Mo looked at the Martial Dao reward just credited to his account and couldn't help but ponder.

"Mmmmm..."

"What did she comprehend this time?"

"If I ask her directly, wouldn't that make the Primordial Heavenly Lord look a bit lacking in style?"

"Right, next time I'll say it's a test."

Li Mo once again praised his own wit.

This middleman isn't easy to be.

See, Princess Jiang Chulong is asking questions again... filling three whole sheets of paper.

Just as Li Mo was looking for Ice Cube's figure in the courtyard.

On the wall of the Autumn Water Pavilion, a woman poked her head out, carefully looking inside.

"Master?"

It was none other than Shang Wu.

"Treasure disciple, you're back? Good thing you ran into me first."

"Stay here, do you want to die?!"

Shang Wu lowered her voice, her apricot eyes full of alertness.

"Ah?"

Li Mo was completely confused.

"No time to explain! Little Bing'er has recently become obsessed with cooking!"

"Quick, follow the Master!"

Shang Wu was extremely serious.

Li Mo: "....."

Guess when I got back?

I was wondering why I haven't seen the Master for the past two days.

As the saying goes, there's always a cure for everything.

Even a Master who fears nothing and no one has moments when she has to be careful.
