# Chapter 110: Junior Brother Su, I Accept Your Concession!

With Ma Wu's defeat, the morale of the common-born disciples plummeted. In the following two matches, there was no sign of recovery. Though several took to the stage to compete, they were swiftly knocked off the platform in just a few moves, leaving them in disarray.

The Starry Silver Sand Qi was claimed by Ji Mobai of the Tiangang Peak lineage. His strength was formidable, and his Tiangang Seal technique was profoundly mysterious. He stepped onto the jade platform alone, enveloping it with his seals. Several challengers attempted to ascend but were suppressed mid-air by strange starlight, unable to even reach the platform.

The Cloud Dream Marsh Talisman Qi was claimed by a male disciple of the Formless lineage, while the "Lunar Radiance Qi" of the Toad Moon Divine Light Diagram was taken by a female disciple of the Reflecting Moon lineage.

The earlier matches were one thing, but when the Lunar Radiance Qi was also snatched by a disciple of the seven lineages, the common-born disciples' spirits were utterly crushed. Many sat in silence, their eyes dull with despair.

Among the Seven True Diagrams of the Dao Sect, common-born disciples could generally only cultivate the lower three, while those from the seven lineages and noble families could cultivate all seven. Though the lower three diagrams were slightly inferior in profundity compared to the other four, they were still among the secret transmissions of the Dao Academy, capable of leading directly to the Golden Core realm. Their power was not to be underestimated. Some disciples from the seven lineages, whose innate constitution and comprehension aligned with these diagrams, also chose to cultivate them, as they faced fewer obstacles when breaking through and competing for Qi.

The current competition for Qi at the Flowing Cloud Banquet was the best proof of this. When cultivating the same diagram, common-born disciples were simply no match for those from the seven lineages. Though many stepped forward, they ultimately returned in defeat.

By now, five of the top seven-grade Qi had been decided—none claimed by common-born disciples. Yet the competition continued.

"The Verdant Wood Profound Qi, the foundation for forging the Green Ginseng Dao Base—who will compete for it?" At the front of the hall, an elder waved his sleeve, and a wisp of green Qi flew out, hovering above the jade platform alongside a verdant token.

"Haha, fellow junior brothers, this humble Su, blessed with the innate Wood Dao Body, shall claim this Qi!" As soon as the elder finished speaking, a handsome young man from the Su family, fan in hand, stepped onto the jade platform with a smile, as if he had been waiting for this moment.

Seeing this, the few common-born disciples who cultivated the Heaven-Eternal Green Diagram paled. They hadn't expected someone from a noble family to also cultivate this diagram. After a moment of hesitation, they dared not step forward. The Su family was a Golden Core lineage, and this young man possessed the Wood Dao Body—clearly not someone to be trifled with. The odds of victory were slim.

"Dao is won through contention—defeat is no shame!" After a pause, one of the common-born disciples stood and issued a challenge to the Su scion.

"After you!" the Su youth replied with a smile, his tone polite but his eyes filled with disdain.

"Guardian Spirit Seal!"
"Verdant Wood Slash!"
"Spirit-Severing Seal!"

The common-born disciple unleashed his techniques the moment he stepped onto the platform, first bolstering his spiritual sense to protect himself before launching a rapid assault. But the Su youth merely chuckled. The vast spiritual sense in his sea of consciousness surged forth like massive vines, shattering the disciple's Guardian Spirit Seal in an instant.

The common-born disciple froze in shock. With a wave of his hand, the Su youth unleashed several powerful seals, knocking his opponent off the platform in seconds.

"To produce one Ma Wu was already your lot's good fortune. Without even top-grade spiritual sense, how could you hope to compete with us?" The Su youth couldn't suppress a sneer after his victory, openly mocking his defeated foe.

The common-born disciples below seethed with anger but had no retort. While spiritual sense wasn't the sole determinant in combat, without even matching this basic requirement, how could they hope to rival the disciples of noble families and the seven lineages? Ma Wu's earlier victory had seemed effortless, but the hidden dangers within were not for outsiders to know.

"Does anyone else wish to test my seals?" Seeing the common-born disciples fall silent, the Su youth laughed loudly, his voice ringing across the hall. He knew none from the noble families or seven lineages cultivated the Heaven-Eternal Green Diagram. What hope did these common-born disciples have against him? This slot was his—no one could stop him!

Bian Chuyao, watching from below, shook her head slightly, a knowing smile playing on her lips. The sharp-eyed noble disciples beside her frowned, puzzled by her reaction.

At that moment, a calm voice rang out from the crowd. "I would like to test Junior Brother Su's skills."

With these words, a tall, handsome figure rose and stepped onto the jade platform.

"Such arrogance! Who are you to call me 'junior brother'?" The Su youth's face darkened as he snapped back. Not all noble disciples were as approachable as Bian Chuyao. Many, especially descendants of Golden Core experts, looked down on common-born disciples, viewing the Hidden Dragon Academy as little more than a muddy pit for raising expendable Qi Refining cultivators—unworthy of competing at the Flowing Cloud Banquet for true inheritance slots. The first five Qi allocations had already proven this.

Enraged by Gu Yuan's presumptuous address, the Su youth unleashed the vast spiritual sense in his sea of consciousness, forming a massive vine that lashed out like an ancient tree's wrath.

**Top-grade spiritual sense: Verdant Vine Colossus!**

Gu Yuan merely smiled, hands behind his back. A silver dragon coiled forth from his sea of consciousness, its claws bared as it met the Su youth's attack head-on. Normally, Gu Yuan wasn't one for flamboyance, but today was different. There was no point in hiding his strength—against such arrogance, only greater arrogance could suppress it.

"Roar!" The fierce dragon's cry shook the void. Having devoured the Silver-Skin Beast Scripture, Gu Yuan's spiritual sense had grown tremendously. The silver dragon now bore scales so lifelike they were nearly tangible, its tail lashing out to sever the vine in an instant. How could mere vines restrain a dragon?

The Su youth stiffened, his body freezing momentarily. Gu Yuan pointed a finger, and Peach Blossom Sword Qi, radiant yet razor-sharp, shot forth.

"Clang!" But the Su youth, born of a Golden Core lineage, was no pushover. Even dazed from the spiritual clash, a seal resembling gnarled vines and aged wood rose from his dantian, forming a gray-green barrier that blocked the sword Qi.

Unfazed, Gu Yuan channeled all his mana into the Minor Giant God Seal and Peach Blossom Sword Seal. Triple the normal mana surged forth, causing the seals to hum as if straining under the pressure, their Dao patterns glowing intensely, nearly breaking free like swimming dragons.

The result was a sword Qi so sharp and dazzling it defied belief.

"Shing!" A pink streak sliced through the air, shattering the seal and drawing blood. As the Su youth regained his senses, he felt a chill at his neck before his body was flung off the platform.

"Junior Brother Su, I accept your concession!" Gu Yuan's gentle voice carried across the now-silent hall. The Su youth's face turned deathly pale as the reality of his defeat sank in.

The entire hall was stunned. A common-born disciple had actually won—and with such effortless grace. All eyes turned to Gu Yuan, who swept his gaze across the crowd with a faint smile before unceremoniously claiming the Qi and token floating above the platform.

This was only the beginning. He still had more to show.
