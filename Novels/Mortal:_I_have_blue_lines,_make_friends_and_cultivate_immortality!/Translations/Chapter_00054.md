# Chapter 54: Wind Thunder Wings and Silver Pages!

Looking at the treasures Lin Yun handed over, Han Li's eyes grew slightly moist.

"Thank you, Brother Lin!"

This time, he didn't offer any false refusals. He truly needed these items. If Lin Yun hadn't intervened to save him today, he might have been done for. He never wanted to experience such a life-and-death crisis again!

**[Ding! Host has gifted friend Han Li with Cloud-Treading Boots, triggering "Cast a stone and receive jade in return."]**

**[Ding! Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Flight Treasure - Wind Thunder Wings.]**

**[Treasure Description: Wings crafted from the Thunder Roc obtained by the demonic cultivator Feng Xi from the Chaotic Star Sea, combined with his own materials and those of other spirit birds. Capable of executing Thunder Evasion and Wind Evasion techniques, with astonishing speed.]**

**[Ding! Host has gifted friend Han Li with the top-tier defensive artifact, Black Iron Shield, triggering "Cast a stone and receive jade in return."]**

**[Ding! Congratulations to the host for obtaining: High-Grade Defensive Treasure - Verdant Wood Armor.]**

**[Treasure Description: Originally belonging to Wen Tianren, who was slain by Han Li. Possesses extremely high defensive capabilities.]**

Seeing the system notifications, Lin Yun narrowed his eyes into slits and patted Han Li's shoulder. "We're brothers—no need for thanks."

"Haha—let's work together and carve out a grand future!"

Looking at the system rewards, Lin Yun thought, *Indeed, saving Han Li was the right choice after all.*

Whether to save Han Li or not had its pros and cons, with the crux being the Heaven Controlling Vial. Without Han Li, he wouldn't be able to farm rewards. Most of his current treasures had been obtained through Han Li.

Of course, there was no denying that the Small Green Bottle was far superior to treasures like the Profound Sky Gourd or the Mountain-Sea Pearl. But Lin Yun still believed that protecting Han Li was the correct choice. This way, he could continue farming rewards from Han Li while having him use the Small Green Bottle to accelerate spirit herb growth for him.

Though he didn't possess the Small Green Bottle, it was as if he did. As for the Heaven Controlling Vial, Lin Yun could only say, *Even without it, I can still become invincible!* If he lacked such confidence, why would he have switched to cultivating the *Profound Sky Five Spirits Technique*? A transmigrator had his own pride!

"Han Li only hopes not to hold Brother Lin back," Han Li said modestly.

"You—always like this." Lin Yun chuckled and shook his head.

Then, his eyes narrowed. "We have guests."

"Wasn't this your intention, Brother Lin? Although there's no night in the Bloody Forbidden Land, and the sky is perpetually overcast, the smoke from this bonfire is visible to those people," Han Li added.

"Haha—you understand me well. Rather than letting them set up ambushes, it's better to lure them all out and deal with them first."

Lin Yun smiled. His true goal was actually to capture a Great Sword Sect disciple and use them to locate the barefooted man from the same sect.

Soon, a group of sixteen cultivators from the six sects surrounded Lin Yun and Han Li. Among their captives was a Yellow Maple Valley disciple.

"Hmph—daring to light a bonfire openly in the Bloody Forbidden Land? You must have a death wish!" A burly man with a greatsword on his back grinned cruelly.

"Talisman Master Lin, no matter how strong you are, after a day, your talismans must be nearly exhausted. With our numbers, once your talismans run out, it'll be your end!"

"Ah, yes, yes, yes." Lin Yun smiled faintly, reaching into his storage pouch and pulling out a handful of talismans.

"Not good—retreat!" The surrounding cultivators were terrified at the sight of so many talismans and fled in panic.

"Trying to leave now is too late."

"Boom—"

"Boom, boom—"

"Boom, boom, boom—"

After a series of explosions, only the burly Great Sword Sect disciple remained alive.

Along the way, Han Li bid farewell to Lin Yun.

"Brother Lin, you're too strong. Staying by your side, Han Li won't grow."

Lin Yun didn't respond but instead set off with the Great Sword Sect disciple.

Somewhere in the Bloody Forbidden Land, Hua Dao Wu's Han Tianya and Ling Shou Mountain's Zhong Wu teamed up with the Chen Family's Chen Qiaotian, intending to teach him a lesson. However, they found themselves outmatched and had to flee in disgrace.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun had decent luck. After spending nearly a day eliminating several Great Sword Sect teams, he found his target in front of a small stone hall.

"Senior Brother Yan, I'm sorry. I didn't want to, but I don't want to die," the man apologized tearfully to the barefooted, square-faced man in black.

"Junior Brother Fang, I don't blame you. This person isn't someone any of us can handle alone," the barefooted man said without anger toward the traitor.

"You're quite interesting. I might spare your life later," Lin Yun remarked with a smile.

"Yan thanks you for your mercy," the barefooted man openly admitted his inability to defeat Lin Yun.

"In that case, hand over your storage pouch," Lin Yun demanded, extending his hand.

"No—" The barefooted man shook his head, staring intently at Lin Yun. "I want to see just how wide the gap between us is."

With a flick of his finger, the silver greatsword on his back soared into the sky. He pointed at it, and the sword erupted with dazzling light, unleashing a radiant sword aura before descending toward Lin Yun like a collapsing mountain.

This silver greatsword, refined with ample amounts of silver essence, had reached the pinnacle of artifact quality—its durability even rivaling that of ordinary magic treasures. It was the first time Lin Yun had encountered such a high-grade artifact in the Bloody Forbidden Land, comparable only to the giant tortoise shield crafted from the shell of a fourth-tier turtle demon.

Lin Yun raised his hand, summoning a tortoise-shell-shaped shield to block the incoming silver greatsword.

"He actually blocked Senior Brother Yan's Silver Radiance Sword!"

"Is that tortoise shield also a legendary pinnacle artifact?!" The Great Sword Sect disciple was stunned.

Even the barefooted man was momentarily taken aback. Aside from a few top-tier senior disciples within the Great Sword Sect, he had never seen anyone else wield a pinnacle artifact.

"Not over yet!" The barefooted man clapped his hands, his eyes blazing with fury. "Greatsword Technique!"

Following his roar, the silver greatsword locked in combat with the tortoise shield erupted with blinding silver light. Already massive, the sword suddenly expanded three to four times its original size.

Yet, the tortoise shield artifact still held firm against the attack.

"Still not done! Silver Radiance Sword Aura!"

The man bellowed again, pointing fiercely at the enlarged greatsword. The silver light intensified, no longer scattered like starlight but coalescing into a radiant anchor—a sword aura typically only wielded by Foundation Establishment sword cultivators.

Under the assault of the silver sword aura, the tortoise shield finally began to tremble, its surface showing signs of wear. The attack was finally taking effect.

"Sword aura? A Foundation Establishment technique, yet you can wield a fraction of it at Qi Condensation. Your talent isn't bad," Lin Yun remarked casually, observing the shaking shield.

The barefooted man, having exerted himself to control the pinnacle artifact and cast two high-level techniques, was now pale and trembling. Pinnacle artifacts were truly meant for Foundation Establishment cultivators. Unless one cultivated something like Lin Yun's *Profound Sky Five Spirits Technique*, which quintupled his spiritual power, a Qi Condensation cultivator couldn't sustain their use for long.

Lin Yun flicked his sleeve, sending out a small green shield that sent the silver greatsword flying. The sword spiraled uncontrollably through the air before embedding itself deep into the ground.

"I've lost," the barefooted man muttered blankly. He had known there was a gap between them, but he hadn't realized it was this vast.

To those unfamiliar with combat, it might seem like Lin Yun had simply overwhelmed him with superior artifacts. But the barefooted man knew the truth—the disparity was comprehensive.

Pinnacle artifacts were a burden for most Qi Condensation cultivators, usable only by top-tier experts like himself. They drained spiritual power rapidly and strained the user's divine sense. Yet Lin Yun effortlessly controlled two pinnacle artifacts simultaneously, appearing completely at ease.

This alone proved Lin Yun surpassed him in spiritual power, divine sense, artifacts, and more. Though he still had other techniques up his sleeve, there was no point—the outcome was clear. He had played all his cards, while Lin Yun had barely lifted a finger.

"The strongest junior disciple of the Great Sword Sect... lost just like that?"

"I thought he was a talisman master?"

"Why is his combat ability so terrifying?"

"He didn't even need to bombard us with talismans to defeat Senior Brother Yan effortlessly! Unbelievable!" The Great Sword Sect disciple was dumbfounded.

Lin Yun reached out, and the barefooted man handed over his storage pouch. After retrieving the spirit herbs and a silver page, Lin Yun tossed the pouch back.

"Aren't you taking the rest?" the barefooted man asked, puzzled.

"No need. I already have plenty of junk like that," Lin Yun said dismissively. He had yet to sort through the piles of items looted from Yellow Maple Valley disciples.

"Uh..." The barefooted man didn't know whether to feel relieved or insulted.

"My Silver Radiance Sword is a pinnacle artifact fused with silver essence—its quality rivals magic treasures! It's not junk!" the man protested, his masculine pride stung.

"Since you've refined that artifact with a special method, it's useless to me anyway. Consider it a gesture of friendship," Lin Yun said indifferently.

"Yan Yu pays his respects to Brother Lin!" The barefooted man bowed sincerely.

**[Ding! Yan Yu has become your friend.]**

**[Ding! Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Talent - Sword Fanatic.]**

**[Talent Description: A special cultivation trait. Comprehension speed for sword scriptures and techniques +100%. Power of sword arrays and flying sword artifacts +100%.]**

"Only double?" Lin Yun was slightly disappointed. But glancing at the barefooted man, he realized that if the boost were ten or a hundred times, he might not have won so easily.

"Junior Sister from Ling Shou Mountain, how much longer do you plan to watch?" Lin Yun said coolly, gazing in a certain direction.

The two Great Sword Sect disciples tensed immediately, scanning their surroundings warily.
