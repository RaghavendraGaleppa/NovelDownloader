# Chapter 353: Li Mo Successfully Turns the Tables! The Demonic Summoning Sect Arrives

Under the illumination of the clam pearls, the guest room was brightly lit.

The sweet scent of the cake spread, seemingly dyeing the lamplight with a layer of creaminess.

Li Mo held the Chixiao Sword and cut the cake. Shang Qinqing was already curious about its taste, as when it came out of the oven, its fragrance had drifted for half a mile.

Moreover, although the cake looked ordinary, its ingredients were actually extremely exquisite.

The eggs were Golden Pheasant eggs, the sugar was Royal Jelly, and the fruits in the layers were all heavenly treasures...

Fairy Han sat quietly there, her fingers lightly twisting the hem of her skirt, her peripheral vision watching the cake Li Mo was cutting.

It was just like when snacks were distributed in class, and before it reached you, you could only pretend to be studying seriously, waiting to put on a look of surprise once you finally got it...

"Is it delicious?"

Actually, Chef Li himself hadn't tasted it yet.

"Here."

Ying Bing offered the first bite, but Li Mo smiled and shook his head, letting her taste it first. Today was her birthday. She took a small bite silently, her lips staining with a moist glow.

Just like the light in her eyes.

"How did you make it?"

"!"

Li Mo leaned back slightly, the hair on his back standing on end.

Making a cake was much more complicated than making scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

"That's right, Li Mo is only two months younger than you."

The value of a veteran shipper like Shang Qinqing needed no explanation. With a squint of her beautiful eyes, she saw through the Ice Cube's thoughts.

Hmm...

Making a cake for her boyfriend by hand?

She had thought the same thing, so when Li Mo was making this cake, she had watched the entire process seriously and even jotted it down in a small notebook.

As expected of the Azure Luan Goddess of the Azure Luan Clan; great minds think alike.

"No, I'm just... curious."

Ying Bing brushed the hair at her嘴角 aside and said softly.

But Li Mo clearly saw the eager look in her eyes!

"You're asking me? You've asked the right bird."

Shang Qinqing put on a profound expression, adopting the airs she learned from Little Li Tianzun.

The Ice Cube's talent in music and cultivation had deeply wounded her.

This was the first time the little Ice Cube had come to her for advice!

"Since you are asking sincerely, I shall be your guiding light for once."

"!!!"

"Alright."

The Ice Cube looked serious, as if she had truly seen a guiding light.

Chef Li was sweating profusely, as if he had truly seen a guiding light to the underworld.

"Senior Shang, my Master hasn't seen you for a long time and must miss you terribly. I'll bring her along to visit you next time."

"???!?"

Shang Qinqing instantly straightened her back and leaned back slightly.

In her eyes, the originally warm and sunny Gentleman Li seemed to have grown two devil horns on his head.

Whispering in her ear:

'Senior Shang, you wouldn't want your Master to be sent to your clan's territory, would you...'

If Shang Wu came, the next cake might really be made with Azure Luan eggs.

"Hm?"

Ying Bing frowned slightly, wondering why Shang Qinqing had suddenly fallen silent. Wasn't this one usually a chatterbox?

She glanced at Li Mo out of the corner of her eye, seemingly wanting to continue asking.

"I want cake too."

Li Mo suddenly said.

"Go ahead and eat."

"Sister, ahhh~"

Little Li Classmate opened his mouth, using all his skills to resolve this crisis!

Ying Bing shrank her neck slightly, her slender fingers trembled, and she almost crushed the white porcelain spoon.

She scooped a spoonful for Li Mo to eat. When she ate some herself, she felt that the originally sweet cake made her heart beat inexplicably faster.

Surely there wasn't anything uncanny put in the cake...

Seeing this, Shang Qinqing's downturned mouth curled up again.

---

Hmph.

Considering Little Li's youth and ignorance, and the fact that he contributed another great meal for her, she wouldn't追究 his earlier threat.

This is called a great bird has great capacity.

Thus, a life-and-death crisis was successfully resolved by the clever Little Li!

He even turned the tables!

"Which places in the Southern Frontier did you go to?" Ying Bing asked, holding the cake.

Her mind was a bit messy, and she didn't have the energy to think about the cake for the time being.

"Yes, I went to many villages and towns, some in the mountains, some by the water... Oh, do you still remember that village where we killed the fat-headed fish calamity beast?"

Li Mo talked about the sights and experiences along the way.

Ying Bing listened beside him while taking small bites of the cake.

Shang Qinqing sometimes remembered interesting things and would add to the story with a laugh:

"Hahaha, there were a few Demonic Summoning Sect disciples who actually believed the Tianzun Immortal's nonsense and wanted to join the Vast Phenomena Immortal Sect to learn the Tianzun's mimicry martial arts."

"I had a hard time holding back my laughter at the time."

"So many villages and towns..." Ying Bing lowered her eyes and calculated silently for a moment. "Then we should return early."

Li Mo's display of divinity in front of the public had almost reduced the Demonic Summoning Sect's power of faith in the Southern Frontier by a third.

In the past, this would have been impossible. Before Li Mo collected such a massive amount of power of faith, the Demonic Summoning Sect would have reacted immediately and would never have failed to take measures until now.

It was just that the battle in Qingmu City had left the Demonic Summoning Sect's Southern Frontier branch unable to catch their breath, and they probably hadn't expected the best actor of the Qingyuan Sect, who could display divinity, to be so powerful, with efficiency ten times greater than theirs.

In any case.

The counterattack of the Demonic Summoning Sect's Hundred Beasts Hall was only a matter of time.

"Hm... The Demonic Summoning Sect is 'heartfelt' to its own people..."

Li Mo frowned.

The Demonic Summoning Sect would definitely find a way to take back the villages that believed in him.

By then, would his future power of faith not be able to be sustained?

Then it would be unknown when he could collect enough power of faith to project the Great Dao Divine Form.

"Alright, anyway, you've made a huge profit this time, Great Tianzun."

"Are you expecting the Demonic Summoning Sect to obediently hand over a large amount of power of faith?"

"They might already be on their way to settle scores with you."

Shang Qinqing翻了个白眼 impatiently.

With so many villages and towns, Li Mo couldn't possibly send a priest to watch over each one like the Demonic Summoning Sect, could he?

"The situation in the Southern Frontier cannot be changed overnight," Ying Bing looked at Li Mo and suddenly said softly.

"I know that," Li Mo nodded, but his eyes were still lost in thought.

Making the Demonic Summoning Sect hand over the power of faith?

That sounded unrealistic and was absolutely impossible.

But as everyone knew, he was a genius!

Geniuses must bravely do the impossible...

Is there any way?

..........

At the same time, outside Qingmu City.

None of them had expected that although Shang Qinqing wasn't a crow, she had truly been a jinx this time.

On a road fifty miles from the city, a group of Demonic Summoning Sect disciples disguised as merchants were traveling.

In the carriage at the very center of the caravan.

The Hall Master of the Hundred Beasts Hall looked at a High Priest under his command and frowned.

"Confirm once more the direction where the power of faith is converging."

"Yes."

The High Priest was a gaunt middle-aged man, but he was at the Fifth Realm, the Outer Scenery realm.

He took out various jars and bottles containing blood powders ground from the solidified blood of various beasts. With a light rub of his hands, they turned into faint red smoke.

The red smoke rose and floated up, like a school of fish entering the ocean, converging towards Qingmu City from all directions.

It was as if the school of fish had met an ocean current.

"So the Great Tianzun Immortal is indeed in Qingmu City..." Luo Yexian, the Hall Master of the Hundred Beasts Hall, narrowed his eyes and said.
