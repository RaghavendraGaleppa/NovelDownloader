# Chapter 82: Winding Stream Banquet

Under the night sky, as the underground fire springs continuously revived, ice and snow melted, and water trickled, gathering into streams in the mountains. The section of forest Qin Ming had chosen had relatively open terrain, convenient for action. At this moment, he was already surrounded by Dai Shifeng and his ten confidants.

"They're all here!" Dai Shifeng couldn't help but whisper a reminder. The Hall Master was approaching on his beast, but why hadn't anyone from the City Lord's Manor appeared yet?

Qin Ming remained silent. At this stage, if he wanted to gain others' full support, he couldn't keep things hidden; he had to fully unleash his unique value!

A black raptor circled in the sky. Ge Qianxun looked down but didn't descend immediately. He was observing the nearby forest, acting with extreme caution.

Early spring had arrived, and the weather was no longer so cold. The young man standing on the back of a silver exotic beast, clad in white robes, fluttered gracefully in the wind, appearing quite handsome and refined.

He looked down and spoke calmly, "How does it feel to be in this position now?"

"Feet on the ground, quite good," Qin Ming said, looking at this old acquaintance.

The white-robed young man nodded and said, "In the past, you sat among the clouds; now you've fallen into the dust. Your mindset is quite good."

Qin Ming's expression was calm. "You don't need to put on this act for me. We both know how each other truly is."

"But you are indeed not the person you once were. I'm simply speaking to you with a normal heart. Is there something wrong with that?" the sixteen or seventeen-year-old white-robed youth said indifferently.

Qin Ming looked at him and said, "For the sake of our past acquaintance, and for the sake of a certain person, I advise you: everything is in the past. Don't stir up trouble now, or it won't be good for anyone."

"Acquaintance? No need for further words. Between you and me, there's no longer any need to mention 'face'," the white-robed youth said, hands clasped behind his back, looking at the tall figure in the forest.

"Mutual disgust," Qin Ming said, a coldness appearing on his face.

"Yes, I feel the same. You're becoming more and more an eyesore. Some old acquaintances have said you've returned to your proper place."

Qin Ming stopped being polite. "Since there's no more acquaintance, there'll be no more connection. Why are you here now, putting on an act? Do you want to flaunt your noble status and gentlemanly demeanor to me? It's not like I haven't seen you before. Get lost."

The white-robed youth was unfazed. "In the past, when you traveled, you were surrounded by stars, and even your mount was an exotic beast that had mutated four times. Now you're wielding a great hammer, heh!"

Qin Ming didn't get angry; instead, he smiled faintly. "It seems I made you quite uncomfortable back then. Does Wang Caiwei know you're here? If she heard, would she personally break your legs?"

"Shut up!" the white-robed youth said, standing on the silver exotic beast, his voice cold and ethereal. "It's not enough that you've returned to this position. Only by completely disappearing, never to appear again, will it be truly safe and better for all of us."

"After hearing you talk so much, I'm already disgusted," Qin Ming shook his head and threw the great hammer to the ground.

"Do you know what 'the difference between clouds and mud' means? That's the gap between our two worlds right now." The youth's white robes were like snow, his hands clasped behind his back, standing atop the exotic beast high in the sky, truly appearing ethereal and transcendent. However, his words were quite unpleasant, and his cold expression made people uncomfortable. He looked down and said, "Do you understand?"

"'The difference between clouds and mud,' I understand it very well. Perhaps you yourself don't understand it thoroughly enough. Let me help you," Qin Ming said, taking down the long package from his back.

Then, he quickly tore it open and pulled out a heavy great bow. There was nothing more to say. Now, he drew the carved bow like a full moon, looking northwest. As the bowstring vibrated, an iron arrow whistled, piercing straight into the sky!

When the white-robed youth saw him retrieve the bow, he immediately urged the silver raptor to ascend rapidly. At the same time, he wasn't overly concerned. He already knew that Qin Ming had been thrown to a remote place for two years and had surprisingly not yet stepped onto the path of rebirth, only recently showing signs of improvement. He had been delayed for too long; how strong could his archery be?

Thwack!

The silver exotic beast was hit by an arrow, and the white-robed youth's expression suddenly changed. Although only one wing was injured, it affected its balance, and it began to sway. With a *whoosh*, Qin Ming's second iron arrow shot out. The silver exotic beast's feathers shattered, its abdomen bled, and it no longer had the strength to ascend. It circled weakly downwards, barely maintaining a state where it didn't directly plummet.

On the other side, Ge Qianxun, the Hall Master of the Xinyi Hall, made a completely opposite choice, urging his black raptor to dive towards the ground.

"You're quite experienced!" Qin Ming drew his bow. The iron arrow was like a rainbow piercing the sun, instantly exploding the black exotic beast's head with a single shot, killing it on the spot.

In the sky, the white-robed youth's expression completely changed. He realized that Qin Ming had the ability to kill his flying mount with a single arrow, but was deliberately controlling the pace. He looked down to see a stretch of muddy stream bed formed by melted ice and snow, exactly where the silver exotic beast was about to land.

On the other side, Ge Qianxun was surprisingly well-prepared. He controlled the black raptor's wings, preventing them from folding, maintaining his grip as it glided towards the forest. Most importantly, he was very close to the ground. Even so, when Qin Ming's second iron arrow shot out, he became flustered. In his attempt to dodge the arrow, he mishandled the black raptor's wings, causing him and his dead flying mount to plunge headfirst into the dense forest. Ge Qianxun's subsequent actions surprised Qin Ming again. He was actually wearing bat-wing-like black clothes, abandoning the raptor's corpse, and gliding at low altitude, plunging headfirst into the dense forest.

Fortunately, he was indeed very close to the ground, and with his Heavenly Light protecting him, he wasn't harmed. Breaking many branches, he managed to land safely.

On the other side, the white-robed youth controlled the silver exotic beast, trying to change direction and fly towards a nearby mountain peak. However, Qin Ming now controlled all the rhythm. He shot an arrow, piercing the root of the exotic beast's right wing, helping it re-correct its direction.

"You..." The white-robed youth panicked. This was in the sky, and his flying mount was shaking uncontrollably, even about to flip over. He could no longer remain calm. He dared not stand with hands clasped behind his back, projecting an air of superiority. He directly sprawled onto the silver exotic beast's back, wrapping his arms around its neck, and urged, "Steady, land quickly."

Qin Ming fired two more arrows, perfectly controlling the pace, helping the silver raptor choose its landing spot. When it was not too high from the ground, he shot his last arrow, which *whooshed* through its head.

"Ah..." The white-robed youth shrieked, then, along with his dead flying mount, plunged with a *plop* into the muddy swamp by the river. Even though he had done his best to protect himself with Heavenly Light, he was still thrown head over heels, his internal organs aching. Now he was covered in mud, his white robes stained and unkempt, his handsome face smeared.

"Ah..." He screamed miserably. It wasn't that he had broken any bones, but primarily from anger. What a state he was in now?

"'The difference between clouds and mud,' do you understand now?" Qin Ming asked him from a distance.

"Cui Chonghe, no, Qin Ming!" Although he hadn't vomited blood from the fall, the white-robed youth was now seeing stars, utterly dishevelled, and raging uncontrollably. In the past, he and his like-minded friends enjoyed elegance, inviting each other to the mountains to compose poetry, drinking and lying by the pine forest and fire springs, displaying ultimate unruliness. Now, he had fallen into the forest, becoming a mud man, experiencing a different kind of "Winding Stream Banquet." With a *bang*, Qin Ming's arrow shattered the hairpin on the mud-stained youth's head, instantly making him disheveled, his supposed noble young master's demeanor completely gone.

In the forest, after Ge Qianxun landed safely, he let out a long breath. It had been truly perilous moments ago. Dai Shifeng, leading his ten confidants, arrived at the scene immediately.

"Old Dai, why didn't you go..."

"Hall Master, you are surrounded by us!" Dai Shifeng said with a serious expression.

Ge Qianxun felt like digging out his own ears. He was certain he hadn't misheard. What was going on? These subordinates were surrounding him?

"Dai Shifeng, are you insane?" he roared.

Dai Shifeng said in a deep voice, "Former Hall Master, *you* are insane!"

Ge Qianxun was indeed going mad. This subordinate not only led people to surround him but also called him "former Hall Master." This was an blatant rebellion and power grab!

"Former Hall Master, you betrayed Xinyi Hall. Do you even know the meaning of the words 'Xin Yi' (Trust and Righteousness) anymore?" Dai Shifeng reprimanded.

Ge Qianxun was about to explode with anger. He hadn't even lectured the other party, yet he was already being unfairly branded with a major accusation. Was there any law and order left?

"You dare to rebel against your superior!" Ge Qianxun slowly stretched his muscles, preparing to first clean house and kill Dai Shifeng before making any other decisions.

Dai Shifeng's voice was even louder than his. "Ge Qianxun, you embezzled Xinyi Hall's private assets and tried to abscond with the Zhoutian Gold. You are the traitor stirring up trouble! Moreover, you are actually a notorious 'Golden Thief' who infiltrated our Xinyi Hall with ulterior motives, stealing power for many years and undermining the foundation of our hall. Your crimes are unforgivable!"

"Old Dai, as my deputy, you are indeed wasting your talent. However, you won't have any more opportunities. I'll eliminate you first!" Ge Qianxun said fiercely. He no longer wanted to throw accusations; physically eliminating the other party was more effective than anything else right now.

Qin Ming walked over and said, "Every wrong has its perpetrator, every debt its owner. Ge Qianxun, I have a score to settle with you first!"

"There's no personal grievance between you and me, only the bill promised by my employer," Ge Qianxun stared at him and said.

"The Sun family's secret manual was taken by you, wasn't it? And you killed Old Man Sun, and now you're making things difficult for that old woman and her grandson. I've learned the Sun family's hammer techniques; I can barely be considered one of the manual's successors. Today, I've specifically come to collect a blood debt from you on behalf of the Sun family." Qin Ming advanced, wielding his great hammer.

Ge Qianxun was naturally cautious. Seeing the opponent's aggressive stance, he disregarded their true strength and, with a *swoosh*, plunged into the forest, attempting to flee. However, the next moment his expression changed. The young man's speed was incredibly fast; he appeared like a phantom, blocking his path and swinging the great hammer to smash down.
