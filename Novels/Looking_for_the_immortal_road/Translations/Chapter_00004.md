# Chapter 4: Qi Gathering Powder

After Zhao Di completed the first layer of Qi Condensation and entered the second layer, he immediately went to the Rookie Pavilion to find the white-bearded old man, Jian Shi.

Once the old man confirmed Zhao Di had indeed reached the second layer of cultivation, he handed Zhao Di a small black glazed bottle. A look of both disdain and pity appeared on his face. "After all, it's a very helpful elixir for junior cultivators; it's truly a waste for this five-spirit-root trash!" Jian Shi thought to himself. However, he didn't say it so harshly to Zhao Di's face, merely giving a simple explanation of the Qi Gathering Powder's effects and usage before dismissing him, not even allowing Zhao Di an opportunity to inquire about cultivation insights.

Zhao Di dared not pester him further. He took the small bottle and returned to his quiet cultivation chamber.

He opened the wooden stopper, inverted the bottle into his palm, and a round, translucent pill, about half an inch in diameter with yellowish-green hues, fell into his hand. Immediately, a faint, refreshing herbal scent wafted to his nose. Just inhaling it made Zhao Di feel completely invigorated.

"Is this the legendary spirit medicine – Qi Gathering Powder? Hmm, it's truly extraordinary. It feels so comfortable just to smell it. I wonder what effect it will have after consumption." Zhao Di immediately sat in meditation, first taking three deep breaths. After calming his mind, he directly swallowed the Qi Gathering Powder. A moment later, Zhao Di felt a strong surge of spiritual energy in his abdomen, knowing it was the pill taking effect. He quickly circulated his energy, following Jian Shi's instructions to guide this powerful spiritual energy through one heavenly cycle after another in his body. Only after eighty-one cycles did this spiritual energy finally return completely to his Dantian.

"Cultivating for half a day after taking a spirit pill like this, and my cultivation actually increased so much!" Zhao Di happily discovered that his cultivation had significantly advanced.

"If I could take one Qi Gathering Powder every few days, why would I need a year to reach the second layer of Qi Condensation? A month would probably be enough!" Zhao Di thought further. "If I had enough of this spirit medicine, advancing to the third layer within half a year would be effortless!"

Unfortunately, Zhao Di had also heard that spirit pills and medicines were extremely precious resources in the cultivation world; how could there be an unlimited supply? Even this Qi Gathering Powder, which only boosts the cultivation of junior cultivators, was only distributed once every six months per person by the Nan Hua Jian family. If one reached the third layer of Qi Condensation, they would receive one every two months. If they reached the fourth layer, they could claim one Qi Gathering Powder every month. As for cultivators at the fifth layer of Qi Condensation and above, Qi Gathering Powder no longer had much effect. At this point, cultivators would seek more precious and effective mid-grade and high-grade spirit pills and medicines.

To increase cultivation speed, besides relying on excellent spirit root attributes, there were only two other crucial external methods for cultivators.

The first was to find a good spirit vein. A spirit vein refers to a place with an exceptionally high density of spiritual energy.

Spiritual energy in the world is not evenly distributed; some places are dense, others sparse. Generally speaking, places with many people tend to have sparse spiritual energy, such as mortal towns. That's why very few cultivators are willing to enter the mortal world; it's almost impossible to make progress in cultivation there. Often, places with treacherous terrain have denser spiritual energy, forming spirit veins of varying sizes. Based on the density of spiritual energy contained within, spirit veins can be categorized into low-grade, mid-grade, and high-grade. It's easy to guess that exceptionally dense, high-grade spirit veins are naturally occupied by large cultivation sects and forces. Even low-grade spirit veins are divided among smaller and medium-sized cultivation forces.

The Nan Hua Mountain Valley region, occupied by the Nan Hua Jian family, is a low-grade spirit vein. Its spiritual energy is much denser than in other mundane places.

Cultivating in a spirit vein area means the purity and quantity of absorbed spiritual energy are far higher than in ordinary places. This is why cultivators always stay in secluded spots and are reluctant to move around easily.

The second effective way to increase cultivation speed is to consume spirit pills and medicines that strengthen the foundation and nurture vitality, such as Qi Gathering Powder.

These spirit pills and medicines are extracted and refined through complex methods from precious, aged herbs and spirit trees. Not only are the raw materials exceedingly valuable, but the success rate of refining them is also extremely low. Take Qi Gathering Powder, for example: it requires three types of spirit herbs aged over ten years to be repeatedly purified and refined for a day and a night. A novice who hasn't practiced a few times would have a success rate of absolutely no more than ten percent. Even a seasoned veteran who has refined it hundreds of times wouldn't have a success rate exceeding fifty percent. This is for Qi Gathering Powder, which is the easiest to refine and the lowest-grade introductory pill for the Qi Condensation stage. For higher-grade pills, not only are the required raw materials exponentially more valuable, but the success rate of refining them is also terrifyingly low.

Therefore, the cost of alchemy is simply unbearable for ordinary cultivators. Cultivators who can skillfully refine certain pills gain a corresponding noble status – Alchemists. It's almost impossible to become an Alchemist on one's own; every Alchemist has the strong support of a sect or family, which provides a continuous supply of raw materials to accumulate experience. The Jian family has one such Alchemist, but they can only skillfully refine Qi Gathering Powder and a few other introductory and mid-grade pills for the Qi Condensation stage. Even so, their status within the Jian family is quite significant.

It is said that there are four highly sought-after professions in the cultivation world, and Alchemists undoubtedly rank first.

After Zhao Di experienced the immense benefits of taking elixirs, in addition to diligently cultivating every day, he eagerly awaited the arrival of the six-month mark, looking forward to his next dose of Qi Gathering Powder. Without the aid of elixirs, his own cultivation speed could only be described as abysmal!

Even with the help of Qi Gathering Powder, it took Zhao Di another three years to break through the second layer of his cultivation technique and enter the third layer of Qi Condensation. By this time, many of the youths who began cultivating with him had already reached the fifth layer of Qi Condensation, considered mid-stage cultivators. One outstanding two-spirit-root holder, Jian Kun, had even reached the eighth layer of Qi Condensation, just one step away from entering the ranks of high-stage cultivators, leaving Zhao Di, who was still struggling in the early stages of Qi Condensation, far behind.

The most discussed topics among the Jian family members were which young talent had recently made great strides in cultivation or which disciple had mastered a new spell, making rapid progress, and so on. Apart from those exceptional disciples, Zhao Di was occasionally mentioned, but usually accompanied by mocking terms like "five-root" and "trash."

As for that "Little Five-Root" (referring to another person with five spirit roots), they had decided a year prior to abandon the path of cultivation and return to the mortal world.

Zhao Di, however, was unaffected by the mockery of others. He continued to cultivate diligently, showing no sign of discouragement. With his twenty-something year old mindset, he certainly wouldn't waste any time dealing with the taunts and sarcasm of the children around him.

After some more time passed, the Jian family welcomed batch after batch of infants with spirit root attributes. In one batch, an extremely rare mutated spirit root appeared – a Wind Spirit Root holder named Jian Yun. His appearance immediately garnered immense attention within the Jian family. The high-ranking members of the Jian family took meticulous care of him, even arranging for an elder at the late Foundation Establishment stage to specifically teach Jian Yun cultivation. It could be said that everyone in the Jian family regarded Jian Yun as the hope and cornerstone for the Jian family's future prosperity and expansion. From specially finding top-tier wind-attribute cultivation techniques for him to providing various spirit pills and medicines, anything Jian Yun could use was continuously supplied. For a time, Jian Yun's cultivation speed was unprecedented, making him a hot topic of discussion among the Jian family.

None of this affected Zhao Di's unwavering seventeen to eighteen hours of meticulous cultivation daily. However, he did receive some bad news: the Jian family's Grand Elder announced that cultivators who had not reached the fifth layer of Qi Condensation by the age of fifteen would not be allowed to continue cultivating within the Nan Hua Valley. They had to go out for trials and could not return until they reached the tenth layer of Qi Condensation or higher.

Anyone with discernment could see that the so-called "trials" were simply a pleasant-sounding facade. How could cultivators who couldn't even reach the fifth layer – either due to incredibly dull aptitude or, like Zhao Di, extremely poor spirit root attributes – possibly have a chance to cultivate to the tenth layer of Qi Condensation? Simply put, it was a polite way of expelling them from the family. After all, cultivators with very low cultivation contributed too little to the family. For a family to prosper, it always depended on its high-level core disciples.
