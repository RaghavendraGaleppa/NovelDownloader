# Chapter 75: Netherworld Marshal! Profound Nether Ghost King!

At the bottom of Mount Fengdu, deep within the abyss.

Endless sinister energy, accompanied by the waters of the Yellow Springs, erupted skyward like a volcanic explosion!

If Li Zhengjing had been alone, even with the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique, he would have been utterly incapable of descending safely amid such boundless sinister energy.

But by his side, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official unfurled his golden wings, unleashing vast magical power!

Meanwhile, the Extremely Void True Immortal pushed his own magic to its limits!

Even a supreme human immortal would find it impossible to suppress the erupting tide of sinister energy head-on!

Thus, the Extremely Void True Immortal and the Ghost Valley Spirit Official used their magic to forcibly part the surging sinister energy, splitting it left and right.

Precisely because the eruption of sinister energy was too overwhelming, and their magic was stretched to its limits, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official had to rely on his wings to maintain balance.

"In such a situation, without wings, even a human immortal would be powerless," Li Zhengjing thought to himself.

Then, the roaring sound of surging water reached his ears.

Amid the endless sinister energy, he couldn't see his surroundings clearly, but he could vaguely sense that the source of the Yellow Springs lay within this boundless abyss!

From below came countless wails of ghosts and spirits, each cry stirring agitation in his heart, nearly turning his vision blood-red.

A flood of suppressed emotions—boundless sorrow, rage, regret, resentment, and helplessness—erupted within him.

"Steady yourself!" Yuan Zhengfeng's voice sounded strained. "Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique!"

Hearing this, Li Zhengjing calmed his mind and circulated the technique, instantly dispelling all the eerie sensations.

At that moment, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official's voice rang out: "Below us is the boundary of the seal. Inside are countless vengeful spirits and malevolent ghosts, while outside lurk numerous evil entities and corpse kings. Once we clear them, you must immediately use the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique to step onto the sealing formation!"

**Boom!!!**

Two human immortals joined forces, unleashing their divine arts!

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official spat out a breath, manifesting the Divine Fire ability—flames that burned away a clear path.

The sinister energy dissipated under the divine fire, and the ghostly entities within turned to nothingness!

The Extremely Void True Immortal, whose cultivation far surpassed the Ghost Valley Spirit Official's at this moment, unleashed devastating divine arts with both hands, bombarding the surroundings relentlessly.

"I will ascend to immortality! I will enter the divine realm! Who dares stop me?" The Extremely Void True Immortal's face twisted with madness as he roared, "Those who obstruct my path—die!"

Yet the number of sinister ghosts surging against the Yellow Springs' current was immense, gathering nearly seventy percent of Mount Fengdu's evil entities!

Even ghostly soldiers formed battle formations and charged forth!

"Hurry into the formation! There are too many evil entities, including corpse ghosts and demon kings at the human immortal level!" The Ghost Valley Spirit Official's tone was grave. "And the sinister energy beneath us is still erupting—impossible to suppress! Young friend… it's all up to you now!"

Li Zhengjing suddenly felt solid ground beneath his feet. Looking down, he saw only darkness.

He stood upon an invisible formation, beneath which lay boundless sinister energy.

Without hesitation, he gathered the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique, channeling the internal energy of his organs, wielding the power to suppress the Nether Prison!

His left hand pressed downward, borrowing the Divine Fire ability to release his internal energy through his arm, touching the unseen formation!

**Boom!**

Beneath his feet, the ground vanished!

The entire group plummeted downward!

The Yellow Springs' waters cascaded down, and the evil entities surging upward sensed their first opportunity in over a decade, frantically rushing toward them.

But the moment Li Zhengjing's group fell through, the formation instantly restored itself, sealing off all evil entities once more.

Yet the Yellow Springs' waters and the sinister energy continued to churn endlessly.

"To the left!" The Extremely Void True Immortal suddenly shouted as they fell. "The Divine Lord came from the left seventeen years ago!"

Then he turned to the "Divine Lord" and whispered, "Right?"

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official knew that the half-dead fellow in the jade fragment wasn't the true deity, so he had no answer. Thus, he could only follow the mad Extremely Void True Immortal's lead and fly left.

**Boom!**

An immense pressure crushed down upon them.

Whether it was the winged Ghost Valley Spirit Official or the unfathomably powerful Extremely Void True Immortal, they all crashed to the ground alongside Li Zhengjing.

"Where is this?"

Among them, Li Zhengjing's cultivation was only at the peak of internal energy, but with the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique, he recovered the fastest.

He leapt to his feet, gripping the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, and saw that they had landed on a stone bridge.

On either side of the bridge stretched endless icy waters, like vast rivers, beneath which ghostly figures howled, trapped in eternal torment.

Ahead, the bridge extended endlessly, shrouded in rolling yin energy that obscured vision.

Looking back, Li Zhengjing saw that the bridge behind them had broken off.

Beyond the broken bridge, torrents of sinister energy surged upward, carrying the Yellow Springs' waters in a spectacle resembling a "water spout," ascending toward the heavens.

"That skyward surge is where we fell from," Yuan Zhengfeng's voice murmured. "The bridge is broken, unable to suppress what lies below, so the Yellow Springs' waters and sinister energy erupt violently, flooding Mount Fengdu."

"When this place calms, the sinister energy and waters will recede," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said, struggling to his feet. "That's why Mount Fengdu's sinister energy and Netherworld waters sometimes rise and sometimes fall."

"Look!" The Hanging-Wall Bird poked its head out of the Parasol Wood Box. As a divine avian of auspicious fortune, it was deeply uncomfortable in such a place.

But its eyes pierced through illusions, scanning the surroundings. "There's more than one bridge—many bridges! And… there are people on them! No, not just people—all kinds of beings!"

"Not living beings," Yuan Zhengfeng corrected. "They're all souls of the dead."

Li Zhengjing activated the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique and took a deep breath. "There are many bridges, but it seems only this one connected to Mount Fengdu is broken?"

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official pondered. "This broken bridge leads to Mount Fengdu? Then where do the other bridges lead? And where do the souls on them come from?"

He touched the bridge's material. "Was this built by Netherworld deities… or by cultivators?"

Just then, the Extremely Void True Immortal burst into mad laughter, his eyes wild. Snatching the jade fragment where Yuan Zhengfeng resided, he sprinted down the bridge.

"Divine Lord! I'll take you back—no, you'll take me to immortality! Hahaha! I'm going to ascend! I'm going to become an immortal!"

"Becoming a god works too—eternal life either way! To think I'd receive divine grace in my final years!"

"Divine Lord, let's go!"

The mad old man vanished into the yin energy.

"After him!" Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page and immediately gave chase.

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official tried to spread his wings but couldn't fly. Instead, he sprinted forward on his eagle legs.

After half an hour, they reached another broken section—this one a seven-zhang gap.

Beyond the gap, the bridge continued—but the Extremely Void True Immortal was nowhere in sight.

"What now?" the Hanging-Wall Bird asked. "It's so heavy here—even with wings, I can't fly across seven zhang."

"Using magic doesn't help either," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said, frustrated.

Li Zhengjing frowned. "Then how did the mad old man get across?"

"Help! Help!" Suddenly, Yuan Zhengfeng's voice cried out from below the broken bridge.

Li Zhengjing rushed to the edge and looked down. A jade fragment floated on the water.

"This thing can float? Fake jade?" the Hanging-Wall Bird exclaimed.

"Look beneath it!" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official pointed.

Li Zhengjing peered closer and saw countless vengeful spirits and starving ghosts swarming below, frenziedly attacking something.

At the center of the chaos was the nearly naked Extremely Void True Immortal, sinking deeper, unable to rise.

Yet the mad old man fought ferociously, annihilating swathes of ghosts with his divine arts.

"He's still sinking!" The Ghost Valley Spirit Official pulled out a rope-like artifact and tossed it down.

But the Yellow Springs' waters corroded even magic artifacts, and the rope began dissolving.

The Extremely Void True Immortal, protected by his human immortal body, remained unharmed by the waters, slaughtering wildly.

"He's lost in the slaughter!" Li Zhengjing shouted. "Elder Yuan, call him back! He only listens to you!"

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice emerged from the jade fragment. "Extremely Void True Immortal! By my command, climb the rope and return!"

"Got it!" The mad old man instantly regained his senses and grabbed the rope.

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official hauled him up.

As the Extremely Void True Immortal surfaced, he scooped up the jade fragment and flung it onto the bridge.

Li Zhengjing and the Hanging-Wall Bird scrambled back to avoid the splashing Yellow Springs' waters.

"You fool! Who told you to go alone?" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official scolded. "Did you jump across earlier?"

The Extremely Void True Immortal stayed silent, tearing off a sleeve to cover himself before muttering, "I thought even if I couldn't fly, my human immortal body could leap seven or eight zhang. Who knew those bastards underwater would drag me down?"

"Idiot!" The Ghost Valley Spirit Official angrily produced the World-Crossing Boat. "This was given by the Divine Lord! Only by staying with us, under his protection, can we proceed safely! Understand? From now on, listen to us—listen to the Divine Lord!"

"The Divine Lord gave you this treasure? Why didn't you say so earlier?" The Extremely Void True Immortal cheered. "I knew the Divine Lord had everything planned!"

They boarded the boat and crossed the gap.

After proceeding further, a figure appeared ahead.

"Careful!" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official warned.

Li Zhengjing gripped the jade fragment and his saber.

But the Extremely Void True Immortal charged forward, then turned back. "It's a corpse. Looks familiar… can't remember who. Might turn into a zombie—I'll crush his bones and scatter them in the water—"

"No!" Yuan Zhengfeng suddenly shouted, his voice trembling with emotion.

Li Zhengjing understood. "The previous sect master of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect?"

"Yes, it's him." Yuan Zhengfeng's voice was heavy.

They approached the seated figure—a man in robes, his head bowed, hair disheveled.

The previous sect master had died seventeen years ago, yet his body remained perfectly preserved in this place of yin energy.

But all vitality and magic had long since faded from his form.

This was once the world's mightiest cultivator.

"He has 365 Yang-Sealing Demon Nails on him," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official observed. "He must have sealed his own acupoints before death to prevent his corpse from turning into a demon in this yin-rich environment."

"As a disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, we must return his remains to the mountain," Yuan Zhengfeng said.

Li Zhengjing moved to collect the body into the Parasol Wood Box.

"Wait!" The Ghost Valley Spirit Official stopped him. "Three of the nails were pulled out and reinserted."

Li Zhengjing examined the nails and noticed one near the brow had a darker mark—evidence of tampering.

"Pull them out?" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official suggested.

"We can't desecrate him!" Yuan Zhengfeng protested. "If there's anything unusual, we'll examine it after returning him to the sect!"

But before he finished, the Extremely Void True Immortal had already plucked out a nail. Hearing the "Divine Lord's" refusal, he froze, panicking.

"There's writing!" the Hanging-Wall Bird exclaimed. "On the nails!"

Li Zhengjing pulled out the brow nail and found inscriptions.

Comparing them, he realized the characters on different nails formed a coherent text when arranged by the acupoint sequence of the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique.

"It's a cultivation method!" Yuan Zhengfeng gasped. "The previous sect master created this—the 'Dragon-Tiger Storm Refinement Supreme Method!' He once said that if perfected, it could rival the legendary Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign's techniques!"

"But he died before completing it. The version in the sect is still incomplete."

"Perhaps he finished it before death and left it here."

Yuan Zhengfeng added, "This method combines the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique and the Feather Transformation Soaring Dragon Celestial Immortal Art—the foundation for true qi cultivation."

"So only those who've mastered both can practice it?" Li Zhengjing mused. "No wonder it was lost."

He wondered if the disappearance of the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique was linked to this—to prevent the Dragon-Tiger method from resurfacing.

"Who pulled out the nails before?" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official asked.

A chilling thought struck Li Zhengjing. "The Grand Chancellor of the Great Zhou Dynasty."

"But without the Tiger-Leopard technique, how did he cross the formation? And how did he get past the broken bridge?"

"How powerful is this dying old chancellor?"

Li Zhengjing suddenly understood—the Grand Chancellor must have intended to properly bury the sect master but, upon seeing the inscriptions, reinserted the nails out of respect.

They stored the sect master's body and pressed onward, memorizing the inscriptions.

As they advanced, the Hanging-Wall Bird cried out, "The legends are true!"

Ahead, countless bridges converged at a central point.

Their broken bridge was meant to join it but ended prematurely.

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official deployed the World-Crossing Boat to cross the thousand-zhang gap.

But as they neared the other side, a colossal figure loomed on the bridge.

A hundred zhang tall, with three heads and six arms, exuding overwhelming pressure.

The left head resembled an ox, the right a horse, and the center bore fish gills, a bird's beak, and fangs.

Six arms wielded weapons, and a leopard's tail swished behind.

One of the Netherworld's marshals—the Profound Nether Ghost King!

"The legends are real! The Netherworld exists! The gods are real!" The Extremely Void True Immortal trembled with ecstasy. "If the underworld has deities, then the heavens must have immortals!"

He waved his arms wildly. "If I can't ascend in the mortal realm, I'll enter the divine Netherworld and rise to immortality from there! I, the Eternal Great Immortal, have arrived!"

"Realm of the dead! Living, halt!" The Profound Nether Ghost King's voice boomed, his six eyes locking onto the jade fragment in Li Zhengjing's hand.

"Lord of the Nether, you've hidden for seventeen years. Have you finally returned?"
