# Chapter 466: It's All the Work of the Same Shadowy Hand!

Xu Yunfan stood silently, his spiritual sense spreading out like water in all directions, cautiously scanning the heavens and earth.

His spiritual sense brushed past the Tiangong Cave and paused for a fleeting moment when he saw Zhan Yan still holding his hammer before quickly spreading out further.

Since Master Zhan Yan had no intention of leaving, Xu Yunfan did not wish to disturb him. He was currently embroiled in a great deal of trouble, and dragging his master into it would be a grave offense.

This world was round sky and square earth. Although the land was vast, for a Foundation Establishment True Person, reaching the corners of the world was but a moment's work.

However, the place where he had arrived after passing through the realm gate made him frown involuntarily.

Surrounding him was the ancient, unchanging landscape of the Divine Martial World, as if forged from divine metal. It was desolate and empty, with only the sound of wind whistling through jagged rocks, producing a mournful howl.

Suspended Sky Prefecture.

The most unique topography in the Divine Martial World. Here, the Gengjin Qi was abundant throughout the heavens and earth, as if the mountains and land were forged from ancient divine metal.

Looking out, all that could be seen were jagged mountains cast from metal, layer upon layer, exuding a cold metallic luster.

The entire land was barren, with only the howling wind passing through the metallic canyons, producing a sharp, mournful cry.

As far as the eye could see, it was nothing but a desolate metallic desert, and even the air was steeped in the sharp Gengjin Qi.

Moreover, over the years, as the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth recovered, the Gengjin Qi had become increasingly concentrated.

"I've been传送ed here."

"This topography... it was definitely arranged by a True Person!"

This thought, like an ice pick, stabbed deep into his Sea of Consciousness, instantly chilling him to the bone.

His back immediately felt a chill.

Long-sealed fragments of memory surged up, exceptionally clear.

Back when he was practicing the 'Lin' Mantra, thanks to the Attribute Panel, he had turned the impossible into the possible and forcefully mastered the 'Lin' Mantra.

At that moment, his soul was forcibly elevated. After entering the 'Lin' state, he had briefly touched the 'Taishang' (Supreme) realm of his own spiritual state...

He had 'felt' with absolute clarity that in the immeasurably high and distant unknown, deep within the interweaving of time and destiny, there was a pair of cold, indifferent eyes, as if encompassing the entire starry universe, that were calmly observing this tiny, dust-like Divine Martial World.

That perception was fleeting, briefer than a single moment.

It was no delusion, nor was it an illusory phantom born from breaking through a limit.

It was because he was in the 'Lin' state at the time, his mind had reached the 'Taishang' state of no sorrow or joy, where knowledge and action were one. Furthermore, with a powerful enemy before him, he had no time to ponder it deeply.

Now, connecting all the clues, the truth was suffocatingly cruel.

He feared that ever since he obtained the 'True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture,' those eyes had shifted from the Divine Martial World to him.

What fortuitous encounters? What being the chosen one by destiny?

It was all a lie!

This Divine Martial World was merely a 'nursery' set up by a True Person from the Primordial Origin Sect!

The 'Innate Golden Nature' that had driven the various forces into a frenzy and made powerful cultivators risk their lives was nothing but bait carefully cast by them to harvest the 'crops.'

He recalled how the Divine Martial True Person, in order to cultivate the Innate Golden Nature within the Divine Martial World, had even lowered his own status, canceled his registration in the Taihua Spirit Ruin World, and reincarnated in the Divine Martial World to scheme for a thousand years.

Yet, he had been watched by a certain True Person the entire time.

As Xu Yunfan thought this, he felt a chill run through his entire body, yet his face showed no emotional fluctuation.

To outsiders, he appeared to be simply standing there, lost in thought.

Damn it, is there even a chance to play? This Divine Martial World is clearly someone else's backyard garden. My unauthorized appearance means I can't escape.

Xu Yunfan cursed inwardly.

Over the years in the Primordial Origin Sect and guarding the Cold Crow Pass, he was naturally well-versed in the behavior of the sect's cultivators.

Having studied it deeply, he understood that he was, for now, safe. As long as the 'fruit' had not yet ripened, everything was still manageable.

After all, the Divine Martial True Person had been active for so long, yet Xu Yunfan had cut him down halfway.

The other party still hadn't made a move.

This meant that the True Person, or most likely the Qingyuan True Person, only cared about the result. The process of who carried it out was unimportant.

Every sixty years when the Divine Martial World opened, there were always people who gained opportunities—divine weapons, fragmented cultivation techniques, or even, like him, those who obtained a fundamental inheritance. Such cases were not unheard of.

But looking through the Primordial Origin Sect and counting the powerful senior figures who eventually reached Foundation Establishment, not a single one had ever truly touched the core secrets beyond the Divine Martial Dao Foundation!

Everyone seemed to be walking a pre-set dead end with no way forward.

Even the Divine Martial True Person, who was closest to the end, fell to Xu Yunfan, the 'Luck Child' spontaneously born from the Divine Martial World.

Such a long accumulation of momentum.

Now, Xu Yunfan had become the 'lucky' successor. His Divine Martial Dao Foundation had merged with his own soul. So, what was his value to the one who set up this scheme? What was his purpose?

An answer was on the tip of his tongue.

Qingyuan True Person!

This Supreme Elder of the Primordial Origin Sect, famous for his demonic arts reaching the heavens and his ruthless, unfeeling nature—how could his actions possibly contain a shred of good intention?

To do good deeds with a kind heart? The irony is staggering!

All of his schemes must be to satisfy his own unfathomable, unimaginable great desire.

So, what is the target?

Xu Yunfan's thoughts raced.

The 'True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture'!

Undoubtedly!

What kind of existence is a True Person?

To be able to set up a grand scheme covering such a vast秘境 (secret realm) and manipulating the turn of epochs, the object of his quest must be extraordinary.

Ordinary magic treasures, cultivation techniques, or heavenly treasures would be as worthless as dirt to such an existence.

The only thing that could truly move him must be the deepest secret hidden within the 'True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture'!

It could be fragments of the supreme Dao left behind by the ancient True Martial Great Emperor, the ultimate secret concerning the birth and destruction of the universe, or the key 'trigger' to breaking through a legendary cultivation realm.

It was a 'fruit' that even a heaven-defying figure like the Qingyuan True Person had to scheme for ten thousand years and rack his brains to obtain!

And he, Xu Yunfan, this 'seed' carrying the 'Divine Martial Dao Foundation,' was the key nutrient or vessel for cultivating this 'fruit.'

A terrifying fact was laid bare before him.

He seemed to be the chosen one who had inherited a supreme tradition, but in reality, he was nothing more than a slightly more robust 'main medicinal herb' in the True Person's herb garden, being carefully guarded until it was time for harvest!

*Suspended Sky Prefecture, what a fitting name for 'suspended'...*

Xu Yunfan savored these four words in his heart, and a chill shot from the soles of his feet straight to the top of his head.

This likely referred not only to what the Divine Martial Dao Foundation itself lacked, but also to a deeper metaphor.

The 'position' he occupied, the identity of 'Divine Martial Dao Foundation successor,' its very existence was a massive trap, a 'suspended' seat for a sacrificial offering prepared long ago for a higher being!

...But he couldn't see the full picture yet.

The gap was too great.

A Foundation Establishment True Person, even one like him who forged his foundation with the Divine Martial Dao Foundation and was unrivaled in the same realm, was probably less than an ant in the eyes of a True Person.

An ant can still burrow into the dirt to struggle for survival, but his everything—his cultivation techniques, his fortune, even the trajectory of his thoughts—was likely being invisibly calculated by that kind of existence.
