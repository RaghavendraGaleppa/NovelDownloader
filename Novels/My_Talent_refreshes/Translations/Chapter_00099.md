## Chapter 99: Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape

Chu Ning's gaze was burning.

As expected, cultivating Imperishable Bones to perfection truly refreshed his innate divine ability.

What he gained was precisely the divine ability secret art that came with it—Thunderclap Steps!

Almost simultaneously, information about Thunderclap Steps flooded Chu Ning's mind.

The greatest advantage of this movement technique was its speed!

Fast as thunder, that was precisely how Thunderclap Steps earned its name.

It included various footwork styles, and there were two ways to utilize it.

One relied entirely on the strength of one's physical body to unleash astonishing speed. This speed was unrelated to the strength of one's magic power, only to the robustness of the physical body.

The other method involved coordinating the movement of magic power from the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art to fully unleash the speed of this footwork, yielding even more astounding results.

According to the information within this Thunderclap Steps secret art, if one could combine it with the Heavenly Gang Fist, it could increase the Heavenly Gang Fist's attack power by fifty percent!

After Chu Ning fully understood Thunderclap Steps, he couldn't help but burst out laughing.

Previously, the biggest problem he faced when using the Heavenly Gang Fist was how to get close to his opponents.

When he killed Qi Chongmao and Cao Dongxin, he used escape talismans. There was a certain limitation: these talismans required activation time and weren't very convenient. If an opponent didn't know he cultivated body-refining techniques and also used escape arts or talismans, it would be quite easy for them to evade his attacks.

A few days ago, when dealing with Old Liu, Chu Ning waited for the opponent to approach. Then, after blocking with his Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield, he counter-attacked with the Heavenly Gang Fist. Both of these methods lacked initiative.

But now, with Thunderclap Steps, he had far more initiative.

Just thinking about it made Chu Ning eager to try it out.

"First, let's try the pure physical speed without using magic power."

As he mused, Chu Ning stomped his foot hard, and he shot out like an arrow. At the same time, his right fist swung out, aiming directly at a large boulder inside the cave.

*Bang!*

With a loud crash, the boulder, which was as tall as a man, instantly shattered into pieces.

Chu Ning stood calmly before the碎石头, recalling his recent strike.

"Without using magic power, the speed of Thunderclap Steps is significantly faster than a low-grade low-tier Wood Escape Talisman. However, it's still slightly inferior to a low-grade mid-tier Earth Escape Talisman. But the power of this Heavenly Gang Fist, it's not just increased by fifty percent; I feel like it's doubled."

Chu Ning quickly realized that this wasn't solely due to Thunderclap Steps; it also stemmed from his body's enhancement. The fifty percent attack increase mentioned in the secret art must be referring to the same physical strength.

With this thought, Chu Ning immediately looked at another large boulder.

Magic power circulated, and Chu Ning *whoosh*-ed out, dashing forward!

Thunderclap Steps!

This was the more powerful version of Thunderclap Steps, combined with the magic power circulation route of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art.

In just the blink of an eye, Chu Ning appeared before another boulder several yards away.

*Bang!*

The Heavenly Gang Fist blasted out, producing only a dull thud, not as loud as before. However, this boulder, larger than the previous one, mostly disintegrated into dust, with some small shattered rocks scattered on the ground.

Chu Ning's eyes were filled with pleasant surprise.

"The speed of Thunderclap Steps has almost doubled, far surpassing the speed of a low-grade mid-tier Earth Escape Talisman. Perhaps it's already approaching the speed of a low-grade high-tier escape talisman."

Chu Ning then looked at the pile of shattered rocks again.

"And the fifty percent attack increase when used with Heavenly Gang Fist, it refers to an increase compared to not circulating magic power. Calculating it this way, the Heavenly Gang Fist's power is more than twice what it was before."

Chu Ning looked at his fist, extremely satisfied.

He had absolute confidence that if he were to encounter Old Liu and his group now, it wouldn't be troublesome at all. He could directly combine Thunderclap Steps with Heavenly Gang Fist, finishing them off with one punch each.

"The Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art truly lives up to its reputation as the number one body-refining cultivation method."

Chu Ning mused. The reason why few people cultivated it nowadays, besides the high difficulty of breaking through bottlenecks, was probably due to the loss of its inherent divine ability secret arts. After all, from his own cultivation experience, the excellent body-refining effects were one aspect. However, truly combining it with these divine ability secret arts was what allowed the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art to fully unleash its power.

"It's a pity that these Seven-Star Spirit Fruits might be useless for my future bottleneck breakthroughs. For the next stage of breakthrough, I'll probably have to find other heavenly and earthly spirit herbs."

Chu Ning shook his head with a hint of regret.

The cultivation of Unbreaking Sinews would likely be much harder for him.

Thinking of this, Chu Ning began to cultivate the Unbreaking Sinews method of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art once.

When he then checked his proficiency, he found that the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art's display had indeed changed.

[Azure Wood Everlasting Spring Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Third Layer (32/2100)]
[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art, First Volume, Unbreaking Sinews 0/1500]
[Spirit Refining Art, First Layer 376/1000]

The progress bar for Unbreaking Sinews had refreshed, but Chu Ning's recent cultivation session hadn't yielded any progress. Recalling how his cultivation speed had been incredibly fast for a while after breaking through from Undying Skin to Imperishable Bones, Chu Ning quickly understood. This was because the medicinal effects of the three Seven-Star Spirit Fruits had been completely refined during his previous breakthrough, leaving no residue.

Since he had roughly understood his current cultivation state, there was no need for Chu Ning to linger here. His gaze swept around the entire cave. Then, his eyes fell upon the not-yet-fully-ripe Blood Radiance Grass and the Earth Spirit Spring Water in the middle of the pool.

The Blood Radiance Grass would take a long time to mature, and it could only grow in places with Earth Spirit Spring Water. It would be useless for him to dig it out now, so he decided to leave it here for the time being. As for the Earth Spirit Spring Water, after his absorption during this period, its spiritual energy had significantly decreased; it would take at least several years to recover.

After some thought, Chu Ning dug some dirt from the cave and moved some of the shattered rocks he had just created to the cave entrance. He used the rocks to block the entrance and filled the gaps with dirt. Then, Chu Ning took out some Iron Vine seeds from his storage bag, scattered them, and activated a催发术 (catalytic spell) to make them grow immediately.

After completing all this, Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction. The Iron Vine was extremely resilient; with his catalytic spell, it would naturally grow. He believed it wouldn't be long before it covered a large area of the mountain rocks. At the same time, Iron Vine was a very common plant. Even if someone came here, they wouldn't suspect anything.

Returning to the crevice entrance by the waterfall, Chu Ning took out his Wind Chasing Shuttle and was about to call Ling Xiaobai to fly back.

*Ying!*

At this moment, Ling Xiaobai barked at Chu Ning. It refused to jump onto the Wind Chasing Shuttle. Chu Ning looked at it in confusion, only to see Ling Xiaobai bark towards the deeper parts of the western mountain range.

"Go that way."

Then, Chu Ning heard Ling Xiaobai's spiritual sense transmission.

Chu Ning was slightly stunned. Where was this little fellow taking him now? Although he was puzzled, after a brief moment of thought, Chu Ning nodded towards it.

"Come on up, let's go."

Heading in that direction was still within the range of this branch mountain range. As long as they were within this mountain range, under normal circumstances, there shouldn't be too many high-grade demonic beasts, so the risk shouldn't be too great.

"Could it be that there's another treasure land over there?"

He was also curious as to why Ling Xiaobai suddenly wanted to go there.

Seeing Chu Ning agree, Ling Xiaobai happily leaped onto the Wind Chasing Shuttle.

*Ying!*

It barked again, pointing the direction to Chu Ning. The next moment, the Wind Chasing Shuttle shot into the sky.

Following the direction Ling Xiaobai indicated, they flew for about a quarter of an hour. They were now relatively close to the deeper parts of the branch range. This made Chu Ning hesitate. He didn't know why Ling Xiaobai had brought him here, but he no longer had much desire to venture deeper. Although he had made consecutive breakthroughs, going too deep alone still felt unsafe.

"Xiaobai, where are you taking me? How much further?"

*Ying!* Ling Xiaobai barked, seemingly unable to express itself, and immediately grew anxious, yapping incessantly.

Chu Ning vaguely understood now; the distance shouldn't be too far. Indeed, they flew forward another two or three *li*.

*Ying!* Ling Xiaobai barked at the ground, signaling Chu Ning to descend.

Chu Ning immediately steered the Wind Chasing Shuttle down, and then one person and one beast landed before a cave entrance. "Another cave?"

Looking at the cave entrance several yards away, Chu Ning was slightly taken aback, but then his expression subtly changed. On the ground at the cave entrance, he clearly saw several huge footprints.

"A demonic beast's lair?"

Chu Ning reacted almost instantly, just as he was wondering why Ling Xiaobai had brought him here. He saw Ling Xiaobai let out a loud *ying* towards the cave. Immediately, a white beam of light also shot into the cave.

"Xiaobai, you..."

*Roar!*

The next moment, a furious roar echoed out. At the sound of the roar, Ling Xiaobai quickly leaped back, positioning itself behind Chu Ning.

"They bullied me, revenge!"

Ling Xiaobai's voice entered Chu Ning's ears, making him chuckle wryly. But soon, he couldn't laugh anymore; his expression turned somewhat grim. Because at the same time, two massive figures appeared at the cave entrance, one after the other.

This was a ape-like demonic beast, but its body was over a *zhang* (approx. 10 feet) tall. Its fur was pitch black, interspersed with sparse red hairs that looked like bloodstains on its body. On its head, there was a single pointed horn.

Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape, Chu Ning recognized this demonic beast at a glance. He had previously researched the demonic beasts in the nearby mountain range, and this beast was an extremely rare first-order high-grade demonic beast. A first-order high-grade demonic beast could contend with a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator.

What truly made Chu Ning's expression grim was that these demonic beasts often lived in pairs, a male and a female. Indeed, the next moment, another Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape, slightly smaller in size, appeared at the cave entrance.

*Whoosh!*

Chu Ning was still contemplating whether to simply leave on his Wind Chasing Shuttle, after all, these were two demonic beasts equivalent to Qi Refining Level 7.

At this moment, Ling Xiaobai had already shot out a beam of white light, directly attacking one of the demonic beasts. Almost simultaneously, two yellow beams shot out from the horns of the two demonic beasts. One met the white light from Ling Xiaobai, while the other directly attacked Chu Ning.

It wasn't that the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Apes didn't attack Ling Xiaobai; it was mainly because the little creature, after emitting a white light, scurried directly behind Chu Ning to hide, as if it believed Chu Ning would definitely protect it and could block the attack.

*Pop!*

Chu Ning indeed did not disappoint Ling Xiaobai. Just as the yellow light was about to strike, a silvery-white shield appeared directly in front of Chu Ning. With a flash of silvery-white light, the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield directly blocked the yellow beam. However, the light within the shield also instantly dimmed by a fraction.

Seeing this, Chu Ning's expression subtly changed. Clearly, the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape's attack power was not low; although his mid-grade defensive magic tool could block it, it wouldn't last too long.

Chu Ning dared not let the two demonic beasts continue their assault. With a flick of his hand, several beams of light shot out, attacking the two demonic beasts separately. These were True Talisman Spells stored within Chu Ning's talisman ring! As the True Talisman Spells activated, Chu Ning simultaneously sent out two green sword beams from his hands, which were part of the Verdant Wood Sword Art.

At the same time, yellow light once again shot out from the tops of the two Blood-Spotted Unicorne Apes' heads. Two beams of spell light clashed with the yellow light in the air, while the remaining red beam, along with Chu Ning's two green sword beams, swiftly shot towards the bodies of the two demonic beasts.

The two Blood-Spotted Unicorne Apes clearly hadn't anticipated Chu Ning having so many attacks. Unable to dodge in time, both beasts were struck simultaneously. However, both beasts had thick hides and tough flesh; the few attacks only slightly broke their skin and flesh, causing no significant damage.

*Roar! Roar!*

The two Blood-Spotted Unicorne Apes roared furiously after being attacked.

At this moment, the horn of the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape that had appeared second once again emitted a yellow light towards Chu Ning. The slightly larger Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape, which had appeared first, charged directly at Chu Ning.

Earth-element spells were only one of the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Apes' attack methods. What truly made this type of demonic beast troublesome was its formidable physical body. Whether it was its defense or its purely physical charge, both were extremely difficult for ordinary cultivators to handle.

Looking at the charging Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape, even though Chu Ning knew his physical body was formidable after cultivating Imperishable Bones to perfection, he had no intention of directly clashing with it. With a flash of his figure, he dodged the demonic beast's charge.

Immediately, several more green sword beams shot out. Two sword beams met the earth-element spell attack from the female Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape. The remaining few struck the charging Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape's body.

The green sword beams still failed to directly inflict damage on the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape's body; instead, they further agitated the beast's ferocity. The demonic beast spun around and charged at Chu Ning once again.

As for Ling Xiaobai, it had long since nimbly dodged to the side. However, the little fellow didn't flee; instead, it continued to spray ice-element spells from the side, attacking the female demonic beast.

Seeing that neither his True Talisman Spells nor his Verdant Wood Sword Art could inflict fatal damage on the two demonic beasts, Chu Ning's eyes glinted. With a grab, he pulled out a stack of talismans and activated several in a row. Immediately, spells infused with golden, crimson, and white light erupted from the talismans, attacking the male Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape.

Even with its tough physical body, the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape couldn't help but pause momentarily.

At this moment, Chu Ning could have easily fled on his Wind Chasing Shuttle. However, having just completed his breakthrough, Chu Ning also had the idea of testing out his innate divine ability secret art.

"What if it doesn't work? At worst, I'll just use a Cloud Soaring Talisman to dodge and escape..."

While thinking this, Chu Ning's figure flickered, and he rapidly shot towards the other female Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape. His speed was so fast that it faintly created a ripping sound in the air.

Thunderclap Steps! Heavenly Gang Fist!

Before the female Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape could react, Chu Ning's fist, carrying a sharp momentum, heavily struck its body.

*Roar!*

With a painful, mournful roar, the female Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape was directly sent flying, smashing into the rocks at the cave entrance. Its life force was extinguished!

Under Chu Ning's Thunderclap Steps combined with the Heavenly Gang Fist, the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape, which True Talisman Spells couldn't even directly harm, was actually killed with a single punch!

*Ow!*

The other male Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape, having just endured a wave of spell attacks, let out a mournful cry upon seeing this. A yellow light emanated from its horn, but it didn't strike Chu Ning. This yellow light actually traveled through its horn and into its body; instantly, its black and red fur glowed with a yellow sheen.

The next moment, this Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape charged at Chu Ning with even greater ferocity. Its speed was actually several times faster than before.

It was fast, but Chu Ning was faster!

Unleashing Thunderclap Steps, Chu Ning flashed and moved to meet the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape. However, his rapid and agile footwork allowed him to directly bypass the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape's front and arrive at its side.

Heavenly Gang Fist!

Chu Ning unleashed another punch, striking the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape's neck. The yellow glow on the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape's body flickered and then instantly vanished. The next moment, this Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape also flew backward, smashing heavily onto the ground.

Only when both Blood-Spotted Unicorne Apes lay on the ground did Chu Ning finally let out a slight sigh of relief.

*Ying!*

Ling Xiaobai rushed over at this moment, barking at Chu Ning.

"So powerful!"

Receiving Ling Xiaobai's spiritual sense transmission, Chu Ning jokingly scolded it.

"Now you know to come forward? Just now you hid faster than anyone. When will you also become a first-order high-grade demonic beast? You're only one grade lower than others, but you're far behind."

Hearing Chu Ning's words, Ling Xiaobai bared its teeth, looking very unconvinced.

Chu Ning merely chuckled. Those words were, of course, meant to tease Ling Xiaobai. In fact, there were differences even among demonic beasts of the same grade. For example, this first-order high-grade Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape was only at the level of Qi Refining Level 7. And the white ice-element spell Ling Xiaobai sprayed actually had the subtle power of Qi Refining Level 6. From this perspective, Ling Xiaobai's attack wasn't weak. If it could truly advance to a first-order high-grade demonic beast, its strength would definitely exceed Qi Refining Level 7. Perhaps it could even reach Qi Refining Level 8 or even Level 9.

As Chu Ning walked towards the Blood-Spotted Unicorne Ape's corpse, he said to Ling Xiaobai, "Now, can you tell me why you brought me here?"

*Ying!* Ling Xiaobai barked while transmitting a message to Chu Ning through spiritual sense.
