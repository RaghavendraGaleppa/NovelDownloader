# Chapter 133: Very Realistic

In the living room, Meng Xinghai gently struck a set of hanging bronze chimes, producing clear and melodious notes.

He spoke, "The Cui family values their reputation greatly, which makes things much easier."

"What's going on?" Qin Ming asked.

Meng Xinghai explained, "You've won over a dozen consecutive matches. Ordinarily, the main section of the Nightly Gazette would report on it, but the Cui family intervened and had it suppressed."

The Cui family wanted him to keep a low profile, not wishing for him to re-enter the public eye. Otherwise, it would easily remind people of past events.

Meng Xinghai continued, "The Cui family values decorum. They gave up on you before; if you now advance triumphantly, wouldn't that embarrass them?"

Qin Ming felt a bit helpless. He couldn't just remain dormant for the sake of the Cui family's face, unable to rise for his entire life. Why should he?

Meng Xinghai smiled, "I spoke with an acquaintance at the Nightly Gazette. So, when you won your fifteenth match, I had them mention it briefly, just to gauge Cui He and the others' reactions. Based on the feedback, it was quite effective."

Qin Ming immediately understood. Old Meng was an orchestrator, no wonder he liked striking bronze chimes and bells.

He also sighed, realizing how truly "commercialized" the Nightly Gazette was. If Meng Xinghai hadn't intervened, no matter how many consecutive victories he achieved, they wouldn't have been reported. This time, the Nightly Gazette only mentioned cities like Chixia and Jinxi, and his name was replaced by "some people."

However, he thought this wasn't bad. Being overly high-profile wasn't necessarily a good thing, and he even had to thank the Cui family for helping to suppress it.

Meng Xinghai said, "Recently, I've done some research. Some major sects and higher academies, long ago, set a rule: 'firsts' from different cities could compete. If someone achieves twenty consecutive victories, they could report to these institutions and, after passing certain tests, become a core disciple."

This was an ancient rule, long forgotten by many, because the tests were exceedingly difficult, rendering the qualification itself of little practical significance.

Meng Xinghai felt that these challenges were no problem for Qin Ming. Twenty consecutive victories in the near future would suffice.

With this, Cui He and others, after his "guidance," would likely scramble to arrange experts to stop Qin Ming's winning streak. At that point, if the opponents wanted to spar, it would be fine, but they would need to put up rare scriptures as prizes.

"If we could get our hands on the *World-Anchoring Scripture*, that would be even better. It can extend one's lifespan by 'half a lifetime' at most, truly a priceless secret text," Meng Xinghai mused, though he knew the chances were slim, he still wanted to try. The Cui family's old ancestor lived for so long precisely because he had cultivated the *Evergreen Wood World-Anchoring Scripture*.

Subsequently, Qin Ming swiftly won four more matches, bringing his consecutive victories to nineteen. After this, he was free, awaiting Old Meng's arrangements.

"The *Fate-Altering Scripture* is truly extraordinary, possessing unique insights," Qin Ming thought, calming his mind to study the ancient scripture from the depths of the Night Fog World.

On the very day Li Qingyue brought him the secret text, Qin Ming had already diligently delved into it, but there were many concepts within that required continuous contemplation.

The *Fate-Altering Scripture* was a peculiar book, containing numerous dangerous experiments. To extend lifespan and deepen one's foundation, it proposed various seemingly feasible but often fatal hypotheses. He believed that even the scripture's creator hadn't tested all those outrageous methods, yet he read it with great relish, pondering deeply.

The book mentioned seeking out "Fiendish Caverns." Entering one would inevitably shorten one's lifespan by fifty years. However, if one could endure it, their body would undergo a certain baptism, transforming them, and potentially extending their lifespan by sixty years. Qin Ming didn't know how to comment on this section. How was sixty years calculated, and could it be verified? Setting aside the outcome of complete failure, even if it truly succeeded, what if it only extended life by thirty years in the end? Qin Ming dared not fully trust certain specific methods in this book, fearing he'd be entrapped and killed.

There were other similarly absurd methods. The book mentioned enduring the impact of lightning and fire imbued with purple mist; as long as one didn't die, their physique would surely improve. After reading this, he was utterly speechless.

Then, he studied the next section, which stated that if one saw a "dragon sucking water" – a slender tornado extending from the clouds down to a lake or sea, also known as a waterspout – one could extract "dragon blood" to strengthen themselves internally. The phenomenon didn't contain true dragon blood, but a priceless rare substance from the lake or sea.

"You'd be swept into the sky and die a horrible death. Moreover, the text also mentions that 'dragon blood' doesn't appear with every waterspout." Although Qin Ming suspected that the author hadn't verified all these methods, he was intrigued, as he saw some promising ideas.

He had already undergone six rebirths, with three more chances to enhance his physique. The Rebirth Stage was the period of fastest progress on this path. Once one entered the Outer Saint Realm, breaking through subsequent bottlenecks became exceedingly difficult. Many who embarked on this path, as time progressed, would reach a critical point where it might take several years, or even a decade, to advance a small step, ultimately leading to despair.

Qin Ming meticulously read the *Fate-Altering Scripture*, observing the various dangerous attempts described within. He felt that perhaps they could be used to break through realms! Perhaps, by leveraging these stimulating methods, the later grand realms, such as Outer Saint and Spiritual Field, wouldn't be so arduous to traverse. However, the premise, as the author of the strange book stated, was: "As long as you don't die..." Such bizarre statements made many shy away; if they died, the author wouldn't jump out of their coffin to help them extend their life.

Of course, the book also contained many valuable chapters. Although obscure and difficult to practice, Qin Ming had broken through barriers and comprehended most of them, especially since he had even understood the general principles of the first three pages. Qin Ming believed that the cultivation methods of the ancients differed from those of modern people, so modern practitioners were largely unsuited to the cultivation routes depicted in the book. However, his unified Sky-Light Energy could traverse those routes, and with the addition of his Divine Wisdom and Consciousness Aura, these three forces twisted together, allowing him to navigate them with ease.

"The ancients greatly emphasized the transformation of Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang can be reversed. This scripture starts from this point. Those specific methods, seemingly absurd ways to court death, all contain this true meaning: seeking life in a dead end, extending depleted lifespans." Qin Ming gained an insight. He inhaled spiritual essence, integrating his consciousness and Divine Wisdom into his Sky-Light Energy, treating them as seeds to plant in the soil of his body. They mutually acted as Yin and Yang, fitting perfectly with the fundamental principles of Heaven and Earth.

"Alas, only three more opportunities left to improve my physical body in the Rebirth Stage," Qin Ming sighed with a touch of melancholy. He hoped that once he reached the Outer Saint domain, the path wouldn't be too arduous, and he'd find other methods to maintain his rapid breakthrough pace.

Subsequently, Qin Ming repeatedly tested the ability he had gained after his sixth rebirth and was quite satisfied.

Three days later, Meng Xinghai called out to him, saying, "Let's take a trip to a great city."

"That's not like Uncle Meng," Qin Ming chuckled.

Meng Xinghai had never taken him to a great city to compete against others. Firstly, people there felt that young geniuses from remote areas weren't qualified. Secondly, Old Meng had intentionally avoided it, not wanting Qin Ming to become too high-profile. Furthermore, with the Cui family "cooperating" by pressuring the Nightly Gazette to withhold reports, Qin Ming hadn't yet entered the broader public eye.

Meng Xinghai smiled, "Isn't this to provoke Cui He? We need to urge him to make arrangements quickly, but according to our rhythm."

The place he intended to take Qin Ming was Jinrui City, where a young prodigy named Cao Wuji had emerged.

"Uncle Meng, you're not going to make me duel this prodigy, are you?" Qin Ming asked.

"No need," Meng Xinghai shook his head. He continued, "The ancestral grounds of great sects, or within higher academies, certainly have prodigies. If this Cao Wuji reveals himself too early, he'll be a target for many in the future."

At this stage, Cao Wuji would undoubtedly attract the attention of many orthodox lineages, extending olive branches to him. Once he made his choice, everything would change.

Jinrui City exuded a sense of historical grandeur. It was one of the earliest great cities ever built. It was said that during the Great Pioneering Era, auspicious phenomena appeared here, with splendid colors dyeing the mountains and rivers.

"Cao Wuji, he actually possessed a thousand *jin* of strength during his first rebirth. That truly is extraordinary, no wonder so many sects want to recruit him," Meng Xinghai exclaimed upon hearing the news, somewhat surprised. The strength of close to a thousand *jin* in both arms already qualified one as a prodigy. Only such individuals could undergo nine rebirths; others stopped at seven or eight.

Soon, Qin Ming and Meng Xinghai learned that besides the Five Elements Palace, Divine Illumination Academy, and Heart-Questioning Academy, other major lineages had arrived to recruit Cao Wuji, such as the Pure Yang Palace and Origin Academy—all renowned places, famous throughout the entire Night Fog World. However, orthodox lineages like the Six Regencies, Jade Purity, and Sky-Propping remained relatively reserved, with no representatives having appeared yet.

Meng Xinghai said, "Tomorrow, there's a gathering for you young people at the Purple Bamboo Forest by the Jinrui River. You can go and take a look." The Jinrui River flowed through the city, with many scenic spots along its banks. "Legend has it that during the Great Pioneering Era, a divine artifact was unearthed in this Purple Bamboo Forest, becoming the treasured artifact of a certain secret sect."

The next day, Qin Ming arrived there and immediately heard someone explaining the history of the bamboo forest, which indeed had a significant background. He wasn't the only outsider. Many geniuses from various cities had rushed here upon hearing that Pure Yang Palace, Origin Academy, and Five Elements Palace were selecting disciples in the area.

A spring breeze rustled through the purple bamboo forest, which shimmered with a gentle violet glow. A fiery spring flowed through the woods, making the scenery picturesque. Qin Ming observed the exceptional talents from different great cities; they truly possessed extraordinary bearing.

Soon after, he saw Cao Wuji. The young man's eyes were bright, his sword-like brows extending to his temples. He was quite handsome and possessed an outstanding demeanor. Cao Wuji stood amidst the purple bamboo forest, conversing amiably with people from Pure Yang Palace and Divine Illumination Academy.

Undoubtedly, he was currently a prominent figure. Many great sects wished to recruit him, so he was surrounded wherever he went. However, the orthodox lineages he most wished to join, like Sky-Propping and Six Regencies, had not sent anyone.

Some youths stepped forward to greet him. Regardless of what anyone said, a prodigy like him, as long as he didn't die young, was bound to become famous in the future.

"Brother, may I know your name and where you're from?" someone asked with a smile, greeting Qin Ming, ready to expand their network. After all, most who dared to come here were geniuses from great cities, hoping to enter Pure Yang Palace or Origin Academy early.

"Chixia City, Qin..." Qin Ming replied.

"A pleasure to meet you!" The young man across from him cupped his fist. It was a rather perfunctory gesture, as upon hearing "Chixia," he immediately concluded that it wasn't a great city, and thus, without waiting for Qin Ming to finish his name, politely excused himself.

"Senior Brother, where are you from, and what's your name?" A sweet-smiling girl in purple robes approached to greet him. She too was clearly looking to network, as there were no mediocre talents present.

"Chixia City, Qin Ming."

This time, the girl in purple didn't interrupt him and was quite enthusiastic, chatting with him. Qin Ming was somewhat surprised. Wasn't she here to meet potential geniuses who would soar like great roc in the future?

A beautiful girl in white approached, who knew the girl in purple. She asked with a puzzled expression, "This Senior Brother is..."

"He's from Chixia Great City, the number one person there..." The girl in purple enthusiastically introduced him.

"Uh, you're mistaken. Qixia City is the great city; Chixia City is in a very remote area," the girl in white whispered to her.

"Ah, I'm sorry!"

After expressing their apologies, the two girls also found an excuse and left.

Qin Ming sighed, lamenting, "At such a pure age, in the most beautiful period of life, why is it so realistic?"

Cao Wuji, the young prodigy, had the largest crowd around him; people couldn't even squeeze closer. He was surrounded like the moon by stars, at the very center.

Suddenly, someone shouted, "Someone from the Jade Purity lineage has arrived too!"

The crowd buzzed. This ancient orthodox lineage had actually sent someone, likely also for Cao Wuji. In the past, they had always remained secluded, not extensively recruiting disciples, but they had never ceased selecting top-tier prodigies. Therefore, anyone from the Jade Purity lineage appearing here must possess an extraordinary status.

The person leading the Jade Purity contingent was a young woman. She was radiant, walking gracefully as if she had stepped out of a painting.

"Senior Sister, I've admired the Jade Purity lineage for a long time!" Many around them yearned to learn the legendary Jade Purity Energy, their eyes burning with fervent desire.

"You may. Sign up, I'll register you, and you'll just need to pass the assessment then," the leading woman said with a smile.

"Senior Sister, could you be that renowned young prodigy from two years ago? The one who consecutively defeated experts from various cities, routed disciples from other realms, and suppressed the latent prodigies of secret sects? I saw a portrait, and—oh, it really is you!" someone exclaimed.

The leading woman gave a faint smile but did not respond. She walked towards Cao Wuji. As she passed not far from Qin Ming, she glanced at him, then couldn't help but look multiple times, showing an unusual expression. This immediately drew everyone's attention.
