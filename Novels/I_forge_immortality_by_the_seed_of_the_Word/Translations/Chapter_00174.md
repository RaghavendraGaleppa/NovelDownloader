# Chapter 171: The Uninvited Guest

Under the weight of numerous gazes, Zhang Jing's expression remained unperturbed, utterly unaffected by the imposing auras directed his way. To him, they barely registered—not even as gentle as a spring breeze.

Beside him, Qu Junhou gradually revealed an inscrutable smile as he met each stare with one of his own. Soon, muffled grunts echoed sporadically through the grand hall.

"Brother Qu, why bother engaging with them?" Zhang Jing asked lightly.

"Brother Zhang, you misunderstand," Qu Junhou replied with a chuckle. "They look at me, I look back—perfectly fair. Who knew they couldn't even withstand a mere glance?"

"Senior Brothers, please take your seats!" Shen Chu suddenly appeared beside them, bowing respectfully. His gaze lingered on Qu Junhou with undisguised awe. *Such terrifying strength! No wonder he spoke of Senior Brother Ge Qingshen from the Celestial Faction with such disregard.* 

Shen Chu then stole another glance at Zhang Jing. *Dragons don't associate with snakes. Could someone befriending Senior Brother Qu possibly be weak?* 

"Senior Brother Zhang Jing has been far too low-key in the secret realm," Shen Chu mused silently.

Before long, atop the elevated platform, two disciples from the Nine Domains Faction rose to greet Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou. "Greetings, fellow Daoists."

"Ah, so that's why there were extra seats—two more esteemed guests," one remarked, their tense expressions easing slightly.

After exchanging pleasantries, Zhang Jing took his seat, his gaze drifting to an empty spot to his right. 

"That seat belongs to... Ge Qingshen. We may need to wait a while longer," a fellow disciple explained solemnly.

Zhang Jing nodded in understanding. *Ge Qingshen—his strength may be lacking, but his arrogance certainly isn't.* A faint frown creased his brow. The man had left an exceedingly poor impression on him.

Below the platform, the arrival of Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou bolstered the morale of the Nine Domains disciples, who had been cowed by their opponents earlier.

"Senior Brother Shen, who are these two senior brothers?" others whispered through spiritual transmission.

"The one in light-colored robes is Senior Brother Zhang Jing from the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven. The other is Senior Brother Qu Junhou from the Shangyuan Qingjing Grotto-Heaven," Shen Chu announced proudly. "I went to great lengths to invite them to preside over this Dao Tea Gathering. Mind your manners."

The disciples' eyes widened in astonishment. *Both are disciples of the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens!* 

"Senior Brother Shen is truly remarkable to know such esteemed figures," they praised. "Even if the legendary Ge Qingshen, the top Foundation Establishment cultivator, attends, we won't be completely humiliated now."

Shen Chu merely smiled enigmatically. *"Merely avoiding humiliation? If that's what you expect, these two senior brothers might disappoint you."* His eyes flickered toward the hall's entrance, anticipation stirring within him—a novel sensation.

Then, his expression froze.

Five figures, their auras as vast and unfathomable as the abyss, had materialized at the doorway.

"Fellow juniors, you've all arrived. Excellent," Ge Qingshen said with a faint smile, clad in jade-green robes. His gaze swept the hall before pausing briefly on Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou, a flicker of recognition in his eyes.

Without waiting for a response, he continued, "Allow me to introduce our distinguished guests: Brother Ji from the Human Emperor Dao Court, Brother Wang from the Primordial Demon Sect, and Brother Shi from the Zhou Tian Star Palace—all renowned geniuses. They've graciously accepted my invitation to join today's gathering. Show them due respect. Oh, and prepare three additional seats up here."

The Nine Domains disciples' heads drooped, their spirits visibly dampened. Shen Chu glanced between Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou on the platform and the four imposing figures striding forward, his confident smile vanishing. His fists clenched involuntarily, frustration flashing in his eyes.

*"Ji... a descendant of the Human Emperor's lineage?"* Zhang Jing mused, studying the young man in dragon-embroidered robes. The others barely warranted his attention.

The Human Emperor Dao Court ruled over the Taiyu Jihuang Heaven, one of the seven great celestial realms. Unlike Zhang Jing's Qingxiao Xuanming Heaven, Taiyu Jihuang Heaven was governed solely by the Dao Court—a monolithic entity enforcing strict laws where mortals could only attain immortality by serving as officials or generals.

As Zhang Jing pondered, the four newcomers ascended the platform.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, Junior Brother Qu Junhou," Ge Qingshen said, standing before them with palpable condescension. "Shall I introduce these esteemed brothers? Coming from the lower realms, your knowledge of celestial geniuses must be limited."

The Ji clansman remained impassive, while Wang from the Demon Sect watched the exchange with amusement. Shi, who had encountered Zhang Jing before, paled slightly. *Ge Qingshen is being reckless—these two aren't to be trifled with!* He opened his mouth to intervene but caught Zhang Jing's gaze and promptly stepped back, offering a strained smile.

Zhang Jing rose slowly, his eyes glinting coldly. Beside him, Qu Junhou's grin faded as he stood as well.

Before Zhang Jing could speak, a figure clad in golden light swaggered into the hall, his crimson eyes blazing with arrogance. A savage, oppressive aura filled the chamber, sending chills down every spine.

"Tch. Heard this gathering boasts the finest human talents," the intruder sneered. "This Peng Lord has come to test your mettle. Who's the strongest among you? Step forth and fight me!"

*"A member of the Myriad Races? Today just gets worse,"* Zhang Jing thought irritably. Then, inspiration struck. Raising his voice, he declared, "Senior Brother Ge, aren't you hailed as the strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator in the Taiyi Dao Sect? Surely, he means you."

From his perception, this Myriad Race cultivator surpassed Ge Qingshen in strength—a confrontation would undoubtedly humble the latter.

As Zhang Jing's words hung in the air, the Celestial Faction disciples below erupted.

"Who dares challenge Senior Brother Ge Qingshen?"
"Know your place, fool!"

The golden-armored figure grinned ferally, locking onto Ge Qingshen. "Ge Qingshen, eh? A bold name. Dare you face me on the Dueling Immortal Platform?"

Ge Qingshen's face darkened. He sensed the opponent's formidable power and knew victory wasn't assured. Yet, with his reputation at stake, retreat wasn't an option. 

*This is all Zhang Jing's fault!* He shot a venomous glare at the man. *After I went out of my way to introduce him to these elites, this is how he repays me? Typical of these uncouth lower-realm savages!*
