# Chapter 374: Take One Move From Me

From the information obtained from You Quan, since the Divine Martial True Person achieved Foundation Establishment and laid down the Martial Way in the Divine Martial World, the cultivation lineage of that world was severed. The Ninth Realm became the ultimate limit, and a Land Immortal was merely an occasional occurrence.

Three thousand years ago, the final struggle of the Divine Martial World's Heavenly Dao was to spur a large batch of Land Immortals into existence. Unfortunately, this was still insufficient against the Primordial Demon Sect.

The white-browed elder's severed arm spurted icy blue essence blood, while the Sky Pivot Sword Elder directly shattered the sword bone in his chest.

The two streams of blood energy merged, and a phantom of a nearly hundred-zhang longsword materialized within the formation. Before the blade even fell, the mountain ranges within a ten-mile radius began to collapse!

Xu Yunfan finally showed some interest. "Now that's more like it. There's a bit of a Land Immortal's aura."

He clasped his palms together. In an instant, the Ten Extremities True Qi within his palms boiled violently, evolving into various phenomena through the characteristic of "All Techniques Returning to the Flow."

Dragon and Tiger Pill Strength formed scales and claws, Pure Yang One Qi transformed into golden radiance, and the Nine Luminaries forged the shadow of a mountain's spirit. The true meanings of his various martial arts actually merged into one within a single breath.

*Boom!*

The sea of clouds atop Heavenly Pillar Peak suddenly exploded. A golden, three-headed, six-armed phantom of a deity rose from the ground behind Xu Yunfan.

The Dharma Form stood over three zhang tall, its six arms holding the phantoms of weapons such as a hammer, a mace, a sword, and a seal.

"The Martial Dharma Form of the Xuantian Baolu?!"

The white-browed sword elder's eyes widened. He had naturally seen the Xuantian Baolu before. The Xuanzhen Sect had even spent hundreds of years studying it and managed to cultivate a Martial Dharma Form that shone brilliantly several hundred years ago.

He exchanged a glance with the Sky Pivot Sword Elder, and both saw the tidal waves of shock in each other's eyes.

As Supreme Elders of the Sword Pavilion, how could they not recognize this item?

The *Xuantian Baolu* was the supreme treasure of the Celestial Pivot Sect, a remnant left by an Outer Realm Heavenly Demon, and was regarded by the top sects as containing the true solution to the future path of the Martial Way.

Countless masters had observed the treasure, but none had ever truly condensed a Dharma Form. Only the Dragon and Tiger True Qi of the Xuanzhen Sect could manifest true qi into form early, condensing a Dragon and Tiger to form a Martial Dharma Form.

However, the imposing manner of the Dharma Form behind Xu Yunfan was far more shocking than that of the Xuanzhen Sect.

"Impossible..."

The Sky Pivot Sword Elder gripped his Coiling Dragon Staff until it creaked. He felt no fear in his heart. Having devoted his life to the sword, he suspected that Xu Yunfan had perhaps opened up a new path for the Martial Way.

A dead silence fell over the mountain gate.

The young disciples were petrified, and a few with shallow cultivation had their mouths and noses bleeding from the pressure of the Dharma Form.

"Two Elements Sword Formation! Immediately!" the white-browed sword elder suddenly roared, his voice like a blade scraping against bone.

His withered body erupted with unprecedented coldness, even the wound of his severed arm freezing over. This was an anomaly caused by pushing his true qi to its absolute limit.

Before the white-browed sword elder's words had even faded, the Sword Pavilion's earth veins trembled violently. The stone steps of the mountain gate shattered inch by inch, and the formation beneath the ground added its power, erupting into a blinding blood light that shot into the sky.

He stood back-to-back with the Sword Elder, the two streams of essence blood intertwining like dragons and snakes.

*Zheng!*

A sword cry shook the heavens. The hundred-zhang longsword shadow suspended in the air began to rapidly solidify.

The body of the sword was forged like black ice, yet its surface was entwined with scarlet blood flames. Before the sword's edge even arrived, the air atop the entire Heavenly Pillar Peak had already been torn apart, producing sharp whistling sounds.

The moment the giant sword fell, the ancient pines on the summit were uprooted and turned into dust by the sword qi before they could even hit the ground. The swords of the observing disciples trembled in unison. After their scabbards exploded, the thousand or so sharp swords flew uncontrollably towards the giant sword shadow, merging into the sword light like subjects paying homage to a king.

Xu Yunfan looked up, his golden pupils reflecting the sword shadow that was tearing through the firmament.

His black robe crackled in the storm of sword qi. The green stone platform beneath his feet had already collapsed into a giant pit, yet his eyes were filled with interest.

"Using one's lifespan as fuel to burn this dying flame... it is indeed brilliant."

Just as the giant sword was about to strike his head, he lightly raised his right palm, and the three-headed, six-armed golden deity behind him simultaneously formed a seal.

The weapons held by the six phantom arms—hammer, mace, sword, seal, and others—suddenly solidified, transforming into six mountain-sized true forms of the Martial Way, which正面撞去 (collided head-on) with the Sword of Immortal Slaying shadow.

*BOOM!!!*

The world turned white.

Immediately after, a ring-shaped shockwave erupted, and the signboard of the Sword Pavilion's mountain gate was blown into dust.

After a stalemate of three breaths, the sword shadow shattered inch by inch, while Xu Yunfan's golden body grew even more solid, even devouring the scattered fragments of sword intent.

The two elders collapsed to the ground, their faces withering visibly to the naked eye.

The Sword Elder struggled to form a sword finger, wanting to detonate the sword seed within his body to prevent the other from getting it, but Xu Yunfan grabbed him from afar. The elder flew up like a ragdoll.

"I said I would borrow something from you all. Why are you being so unreasonable?"

Xu Yunfan's five fingers tightened, and the Ten Extremities Suction activated.

The Sword Elder's skin rapidly turned gray, and threads of green-gold sword qi溢出 (spilled) from his seven orifices. This was the "Void-Moving Sword Essence" he had painstakingly cultivated for a hundred years.

The white-browed sword elder fared even worse. Even the Cold Soul Sword Marrow from his very bones was extracted, turning into threads of ice crystals that merged into Xu Yunfan's fingertips.

By the time the two had turned into two skeletons wrapped in human skin, Xu Yunfan closed his eyes to feel the surging foreign true qi within his body.

The Sword Pavilion's true qi was sharp and matchless, clashing with the Buddhist true qi and the true qi of the old eunuch of the Great Zhou, which he had yet to refine. Under the mediation of the Ten Extremities True Qi, they gradually fused.

With every great cycle the Ten Extremities True Qi completed in his body, a portion of these foreign true qi was refined and integrated into his own.

In just a few breaths, Xu Yunfan's slightly swollen body returned to calm. He lightly exhaled a mouthful of turbid qi,顺势 (taking the opportunity) to expel the mixed true qi from his body.

It seemed that the quality of Ninth Realm Qi Condensation experts was different. The three Supreme Elders of the Sword Pavilion were equivalent to the six Ninth Realm Qi Condensation experts he had absorbed within the Jade Capital.

He looked in the direction of the Xuanzhen Sect. The Jiangnan Dao was closest to the Lingnan Dao, and from there, he would turn back towards the Northern Desert, and then to the Jiannan Dao.

Making such a loop, with his current speed plus the time to clean up and absorb true qi, he could complete it in less than two days.

Xu Yunfan's gaze fell, sweeping over the disciples of the Sword Pavilion. The corner of his mouth hooked up, revealing a似笑非笑 (似笑非笑) arc, but the golden pupils in his eyes grew even colder, like a ten-thousand-year-old cold pool, freezing to the soul.

This pair of eyes made the hearts of all the Sword Pavilion disciples present turn cold.

"Your Sword Pavilion took advantage of the situation to hunt the disciples of my Dao Sect. In the Jade Capital, less than one tenth of my Dao Sect's disciples survived. The Dao Sect's domain was hunted..."

His tone was flat, yet every word was like a knife, causing the minds of the Sword Pavilion members to tremble violently. "Today, I will naturally take it back."

Before his words had faded, his right palm gripped empty air, and the Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammer at his waist leaped into his hand with a *zheng* sound.

The body of the hammer was entirely black. The moment it entered his hand, the entire Heavenly Pillar Peak trembled violently, as if it could not bear the weight of this hammer.

"Enough talk. Take one move from me."

Xu Yunfan slowly raised the hammer, the Ten Extremities True Qi surging out like a raging sea, condensing into a brilliant black light at the hammer's edge. "In one move, whether you live or die is no longer my concern."

"Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall · Heaven's Collapse!"

The hammer fell!

In an instant, the sky and earth lost their color.

Wherever the hammer's edge passed, mountains shattered inch by inch like glass, revealing pitch-black abyssal rifts.

Then, the Ten Extremities True Qi transformed into nine scarlet-gold pythons, entwining the hammer's body as they roared and slammed into the Sword Pavilion's mountain gate.
