# Chapter 140: Returning Home, the Elated Old Li, and the End of the Battle

In the blink of an eye, the Money Tree had already brought them to Qinghe County.

They landed in their own courtyard.

From a great distance, Li Mo could still feel the commotion coming from Red Maple Mountain—it was earth-shaking.

Dozens of Inner Scenery and even Outer Scenery experts were clashing; it was truly no different from a natural disaster.

"I must hurry back to assist in the battle."

After setting everyone down, Qian Bufan clasped his hands behind his back, his short, stout figure radiating an imposing aura.

"You all should... have nothing else to attend to, right?"

Everyone shook their heads one after another.

"Elder Qian."

Li Mo stepped forward and said earnestly, "Han Zhen is the Grand Advisor of the former Great Shang Dynasty. His methods are strange and complex. After joining forces with the Demon Summoning Sect, who knows what sinister tricks he might use. Please be extra careful, Elders."

He had already looked with his Eye of Fate.

Elder Qian might suffer a minor injury this time, but it wouldn't be serious.

He was just casually reminding him.

"The Grand Advisor of Great Shang..."

Qian Bufan squinted his small bean-like eyes and nodded. "Rest assured. Thanks to you this time, we were prepared for the enemy. With Senior Brother Shangguan and Lord Fen Yulin here, no great chaos will occur."

"You have rendered a great merit; the Sect will surely reward you."

"It is only what a disciple should do."

Li Mo cupped his fists.

To think that he had just happened to look and ended up catching such a big fish.

The elders of the Qingyuan Sect were reliable indeed; even Sect Master Shangguan had come in person.

By then, quite a few investments would likely be credited to him.

Qian Bufan shot up into the sky.

"Haa... I still can't rest."

Li Mo's entire body relaxed. Having just gone through a great battle where space itself was shattered, he felt as if his body had been hollowed out; he didn't even want to move a finger.

"Son." x2

The familiar calls had just reached his ears when he could no longer keep his heavy eyelids open and fell asleep.

"Snore..."

Li Mo had fallen asleep.

The middle-aged couple looked at their son, who had leaned against Ying Bing and fallen asleep, and fell silent.

Shang Wu had been sleeping just a moment ago too.

The moment their son got home, he instantly fell asleep.

Just what exactly had he learned from Shang Wu?

"Someone, bring the Young Master back to his room."

After checking him over, the couple saw that although Li Mo's upper garments were torn to shreds, he wasn't injured in the slightest. They let out a sigh of relief.

They then had the servants carry Li Mo to his room.

"If he's really just sleeping every day along with Elder Shang Wu, that's one thing, but I hope he isn't learning other messy things..."

Li Dalong's face was filled with worry.

His son's personality was originally a bit mischievous, so he had thought that sending the child to the Qingyuan Sect to hone himself would help him learn some skills while also toning down his temper.

He never would have imagined that Mo'er would actually become a disciple under Shang Wu!

He used to be mischievous; would he become so annoying that even dogs and people would dislike him in the future?

"Master."

Gu Xueqin tugged on her husband's sleeve.

Li Dalong then came back to his senses and cupped his fists toward the crowd in the courtyard. "Young heroes, my son has been under your care. I apologize for any trouble he may have caused you."

"The manor has prepared wine and dishes; please..."

Old Li held an official position and had seen the world.

He could tell from their clothes that these young martial artists were all extraordinary geniuses from major sects, the elite among men.

There were disciples from the Fen Yulin Forest, the Gangdou Sect, and even true disciples of the Qingyuan Sect.

Any one of them would be treated with courtesy and carefully attended to, even by the county magistrate.

Let alone the disciple of the Hengyun Sword City with the sword on his back—that was a truly domain-suppressing great sect.

Moreover, he had seen this person's portrait.

Bai Jinghong!

A prodigy on the Hidden Dragon List; even the sons of dukes and marquises would likely be less prestigious than him.

Whoosh—

However, Old Li didn't even get to finish his words.

"Uncle, you are too humble!"

The burly Tie Qi bowed at a ninety-degree angle, his head nearly hitting the floor tiles.

"Hello, Uncle!"

Ouyang flicked his sleeve.

Bai Jinghong and Luo Yu had originally planned to just cup their fists and be done with it.

But a certain cold gaze seemed to look over, intentionally or unintentionally.

The stare of the Ice Cube.

"Hello, Uncle and Auntie!"

The two moved in perfect unison.

The others naturally didn't need to be mentioned.

If you replaced "Uncle and Auntie" with "Big Brother and Sister-in-law, Happy New Year," the scene would be no different from a certain social organization holding its annual meeting...

---

To be honest.

The atmosphere was indeed a bit like that.

Fifty miles away, they were fighting like crazy, like firecrackers going off during New Year's.

Li Dalong was stunned for a moment and almost blurted out, "All my ministers, rise."

Fortunately, Gu Xueqin knew her husband's nature and及时 pinched his waist.

Old Li then gave an awkward smile. "No need for such formality, no need for formality... Go eat."

"Bing'er, you take the young heroes in."

"En."

...

The couple watched as the group of young talents followed Ying Bing obediently into the guest hall.

Li Dalong woke up from a dream, feeling a numbing sensation all over his body.

It felt so good.

Why did the sun seem so round today, and the flowers so vibrant?

Old Li felt a little elated.

"Do talented martial artists these days all have such good manners?" Gu Xueqin was a bit puzzled.

"Did you notice," Li Dalong retracted his gaze and thought for a moment before saying.

"Notice what?"

"That these disciples from major sects all carry a sense of awe toward Bing'er. It's as if they take her as their leader." Li Dalong said seriously.

He had of course known for a long time that Bing'er was now the true disciple of the Qingyuan Sect's Sect Master.

But relying on status alone definitely wouldn't be enough to make other peerless geniuses treat her this way.

"It can only mean that Bing'er's talent and brilliance make them willingly bow their heads."

"I always said Bing'er is extraordinary, composed, and intelligent."

Gu Xueqin was extremely happy.

Li Dalong smacked his lips.

He wondered if his own brat had learned any skills.

He could only wait for him to wake up and ask then.

...

On the other side.

The battle between the two sides had entered its white-hot stage.

The members of the Demon Summoning Sect were all guarding Han Zhen. Unconsciously, they seemed to have formed a formation.

The formation was neither for attack nor defense.

It was to summon a certain existence.

Rumble—

The sky seemed to be covered by an indelible shadow, forming a scene of dark clouds pressing down on the city. An extremely fierce aura was brewing in the void.

Something was about to descend.

Everyone present felt an indescribable sense of suffocation.

Suddenly.

A figure appeared in the center of the battlefield.

Shangguan Wencang.

He did not release his Domain, but any Domain was like nothing to him. His aura was incredibly powerful.

With a casual wave of his hand, the clouds in the sky gathered, forming a giant hand.

This palm truly had the momentum to pluck stars.

This was the ultimate Momentum, pure Law, and condensed Charm.

"Shangguan Wencang is only one step away from the Law Body," the white-browed elder from the Hengyun Sword City sighed softly and withdrew the dangerous sword qi that had been diffusing around him.

Outer Scenery condensed into substance, and numerous mysteries returned to oneself.

Every move and gesture was like a divine ability.

This was the Law Body!

Rumble—

The formation controlled by Han Zhen was instantly shattered.

Amidst the violent qi, his figure suddenly transformed into ten thousand blood shadows, scattering in the air.

This wasn't him being blown to pieces, but him escaping.

The others were not so lucky.

They were all pressed into the ground by the giant cloud hand, unable to move.

The Xuan Mystery Bone, which had already lost most of its profundity, fell into Shangguan Wencang's hands.

His face showed no joy, but rather deep thought.

"The one who escaped that Li Mo spoke of was the former Grand Advisor of Great Shang," Qian Bufan arrived beside him and said softly.

Shangguan Wencang's face was heavy. After a long while, he sighed. "A season of many troubles."

"The details inside the秘境 will probably need to be asked of Li Mo."

Qian Bufan looked at Yin Huaxuan, who had been dragged over by Shang Wu and was half-dead, and couldn't help but sigh. "If not for him, this time in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, our Sect's elite would have lost at least thirty percent. We would have faced a generational gap in talent."

"Sect matters will be discussed later."

Shangguan Wencang turned around, his voice echoing through the layers of clouds: "Everyone, please come and discuss matters."
