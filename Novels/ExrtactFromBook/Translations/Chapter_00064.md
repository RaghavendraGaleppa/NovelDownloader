# Chapter 64: Forging Complete  

Three hundred years of erosion and isolation from primordial qi had reduced all the magical artifacts and spiritual treasures Li Changle once accumulated to dust.  

Only this single [Clear Ridge] Rope remained.  

Yet with just this [Clear Ridge] Rope, Li Changle was confident he could contend with any opponent of his rank.  

The [Clear Ridge] affectionately coiled around Li Changle's arm a few times before shrinking back into his sea of consciousness, where it would be nurtured.  

Li Changle then returned to the golden eagle's back. He glanced at Han Yue, who was deep in slumber, ensuring there were no issues.  

After pointing a direction to the golden eagle, the majestic bird immediately obeyed, soaring into the sky.  

Thus, the two men and the eagle sped northeastward without delay.  

The journey proceeded smoothly as the golden eagle ascended, climbing above the clouds.  

Under the boundless clear sky and the radiant sun, the third-tier great demon unleashed its full speed, unimpeded.  

With each flap of its wings, it traversed dozens of kilometers, covering a hundred thousand miles in a single day.  

The journey to the Divine Thunder Palace spanned several hundred thousand miles, but the golden eagle flew tirelessly, reaching their destination in just a few days.  

In the blink of an eye, half the distance had been crossed, with countless mountains and rivers left behind.  

Above the clouds, there were no landmarks except the sun, and only the biting gales howled around them.  

Had it not been for Li Changle guiding their destination, the golden eagle would have long lost its way in this vast expanse.  

The Divine Thunder Palace was now within sight.  

Meanwhile, Han Yue, still deep in slumber, had reached a critical moment.  

At this moment, Han Yue remained sealed off from his five senses.  

His master, Li Changle, had forged the combined third-tier treasures into two embryonic artifacts.  

When these artifacts entered Han Yue's body, they carried vast amounts of thunder-imbued mana.  

Under the tempering of this mana, the two embryonic artifacts were rapidly taking shape.  

Han Yue’s entire being—body and soul—was now intertwined with the artifacts gestating within his dantian.  

This was a connection that transcended the boundaries of spirit and flesh!  

In his fluctuating state of consciousness—sometimes lucid, sometimes lost—Han Yue could only sense two additional heartbeats within his dantian.  

These two heartbeats pulsed at different rhythms, sometimes in harmony, sometimes in opposition.  

Their cadence effortlessly permeated every inch of Han Yue’s body and soul,  

Slowly influencing him, enlightening him, transforming him.  

As time passed, Han Yue gradually realized that these pulsations seemed to convey some form of message.  

He attempted to comprehend and interpret this message,  

But it was as if he were a blind man trying to learn pictographic script—utterly lost, with no way in.  

Han Yue had no choice but to patiently persist.  

Yet, as he continued his efforts, his mind grew increasingly exhausted, and the heartbeat rhythms became ever more complex.  

He felt as though he had sunk into a deep nightmare, his thoughts clouded, his consciousness no longer clear.  

A thick fog seemed to shroud his mind,  

Obscuring the two beating hearts within and preventing him from deciphering the messages they carried.  

All Han Yue desired was a single ray of light to pierce through this fog!  

In an instant, golden radiance erupted within his sea of consciousness.  

A surge of supremely potent mana exploded forth,  

Shattering the mist and illuminating his mind.  

At last, Han Yue could clearly perceive the meanings conveyed by the two heartbeats.  

These pulsations were the divine language of the Great Dao, the profound speech of mana, the edicts of the path of cultivation!  

In that moment, Han Yue understood.  

Two immensely intricate Daoist seals were imprinted upon his soul, never to be forgotten.  

As he grasped these seals, the artifacts within his dantian resonated with his consciousness, fully manifesting at last!  

The first artifact, corresponding to the [Supreme Cave True Thunder Annihilation Seal], took form—a [Supreme Cave True Thunder Annihilation Demon-Slaying Sword]!  

This was a secret flying sword of the Divine Thunder Palace, capable of piercing the depths of the underworld and cleaving the heavens when fully refined!  

The second artifact, aligned with the [Nine Heavens Dao-Tempering Guardian Seal], emerged next—a [Nine Heavens Dao-Tempering Guardian Heavenly Seal]!  

This was the foremost artifact of the Divine Thunder Palace’s Dao-tempering lineage, capable of refining mana, accumulating virtue, stabilizing destiny, and commanding divine abilities when perfected!  

From this moment on, Han Yue bore the two signature artifacts of the Divine Thunder Palace. Though their refinement was still shallow, his divine abilities had greatly expanded, and his path forward had broadened!  

With the birth of his artifacts, Han Yue fully awakened.  

He regained control of his senses and mana.  

Yet instead of opening his eyes, Han Yue immediately entered deep meditation.  

The emergence of the two artifacts had exerted tremendous pressure on his body, and he needed to carefully stabilize himself.  

He sank his consciousness into his dantian.  

There, a sword and a seal voraciously absorbed his pure mana.  

Han Yue’s essence intertwined seamlessly with the artifacts.  

With each absorption of mana, an exchange of energies occurred between them.  

Han Yue could sense vast reserves of mana within the two third-tier artifacts—far surpassing his current cultivation.  

In his perception, each artifact contained a lineage seal at its core, the source of its power.  

Han Yue carefully examined the effects of the two artifacts.  

He found that both were deeply connected to his mana and divine abilities.  

Under their influence, all his abilities had been enhanced to varying degrees!  

The flow of his mana had also accelerated!  

Upon closer inspection, he realized that while the cost of his divine abilities remained unchanged, their power had increased by about ten percent.  

Meanwhile, his mana circulation speed had improved by a full twenty percent!  

This was an astonishing boost that far exceeded his expectations.  

Despite being newly forged, the artifacts had already significantly enhanced his combat prowess and cultivation efficiency.  

As Han Yue’s foundational artifacts, they still had immense room for growth!  

In the future, he would have ample time and opportunities to refine them further.  

The methods for refining the artifacts were etched into his mind as if by instinct.  

Han Yue attempted to channel his mana according to these methods.  

Before long, he had condensed an additional lineage seal for each artifact.  

Now, each artifact bore two seal characters!  

Yet, merely forming these two small seals had consumed nearly eighty percent of his mana.  

The effects, however, were immediate.  

With just one additional seal, Han Yue could already feel the artifacts’ power increasing, further amplifying his abilities!  

According to the *Supreme Cave Nine Heavens Spirit-Tempering Secret Record*,  

These lineage artifacts could be refined in stages.  

Every nine seals formed one *refinement*. Upon completion, the artifact’s power would leap forward.  

Every nine refinements formed one *revolution*. Upon completion, the artifact’s power would undergo a qualitative transformation!  

Before reaching the second tier, a cultivator could refine an artifact up to three revolutions.  

Before the third tier, the limit was six revolutions.  

Only after transcending the Heavenly Gate of Longevity could an artifact be refined to the ultimate stage—nine revolutions, formed from eighty-one refinements!  

Only the most diligent and formidable cultivators could forge a nine-revolution artifact, capable of ascending to become a true treasure!
