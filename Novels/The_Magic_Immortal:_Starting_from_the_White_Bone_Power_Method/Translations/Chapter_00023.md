# Chapter 23: Robber Cultivators  

At the beginning of the You hour, the setting sun hung like blood in the sky.  

Wang Chan emerged from the Black River Market, moving swiftly. If he maintained this pace without delay, he would likely reach Lotus Mountain by the middle of the You hour.  

Truthfully, traveling at this hour carried some danger.  

Demonic creatures and beasts, upon seeing the sunset, reacted much like human cultivators did to dawn—early risers among them had already begun hunting. Perhaps they too understood the saying, "The early bird catches the worm."  

Running along the riverbank, the waters roared while mist rose between the mountain forests. The cold hues of dusk cast a lonely shadow on the ground, making Wang Chan feel like a lone wolf from the north.  

"Ah!"  

Suddenly, a woman's scream pierced the air.  

Wang Chan immediately halted. About twenty feet ahead stood a large, umbrella-like tree. Beneath it, a female cultivator was tied in a humiliating posture, completely exposed.  

She was slender, her figure underdeveloped.  

Beside her, a bald male cultivator at the mid Qi Refining stage and a lecherous-looking early-stage Qi Refining cultivator surrounded her, clearly intending to commit an unspeakable act.  

From the looks of it, the bald man was to go first. He held a delicate white storage bag between his teeth while groping her. His companion, meanwhile, rubbed his hands together with a vile grin, though his eyes darted around—likely keeping watch.  

Upon spotting Wang Chan, the lecherous man opened his mouth to shout a warning, but the bald man sensed something and abruptly turned. One hand rested on his storage pouch while the other removed the bag from his mouth. His lewd expression instantly twisted into brutality, his bulging eyes glaring coldly at Wang Chan.  

Wang Chan met his gaze without flinching, his face expressionless. He neither retreated nor made any unnecessary movements, his arms hanging naturally at his sides. Within his sleeves, two silver needles darkened to black.  

The two stood in tense silence as the evening wind blew in from the river, carrying a chill.  

After a long moment, the bald man grinned. He rummaged through the white storage bag, pulled out ten spirit coins, and tossed them onto the ground about three feet in front of Wang Chan.  

"Since you're here, take a share," he said gruffly. "A small token—don't complain it's too little."  

Wang Chan didn't even glance at the coins, his gaze still locked onto the man, his expression unchanged.  

The bald man grew increasingly agitated under Wang Chan's unblinking stare. After a moment of hesitation, he yanked the rope binding the woman free, slung her limp form over his shoulder, and muttered something to his companion.  

The two then cautiously retreated about thirty feet into the forest to the left. Seeing that Wang Chan made no move to stop them, they turned and fled.  

---  

Wang Chan remained motionless for over ten breaths before finally exhaling softly and continuing his sprint forward. He didn't spare a single glance at the coins on the ground.  

This was his first encounter with robber cultivators in this world. Claiming he wasn't nervous would be a lie, but at least he had kept his composure.  

As for playing the hero and saving the woman? That was out of the question.  

*When weak, focus on self-preservation.*  

Dealing with robber cultivators was the job of patrol guards. A lone wilderness rogue like him wouldn't risk meddling in such affairs.  

The ten spirit coins on the ground could buy about ten bottles of [Spirit Nourishing Elixir]—no small sum. But if he took them, how would he be any different from those two scum?  

More importantly, the shadow of Madam Cheng still lingered in his mind. Who knew if those coins were laced with something foul? A little filth was one thing, but poison?  

Records stated that robber cultivators employed all sorts of underhanded methods—ones that were impossible to fully guard against.  

---  

The time it took to drink a cup of tea later, the bald man and his lecherous companion returned. Seeing the scattered coins still on the ground, they exchanged glances.  

The bald man formed a hand seal, and thin gray-white threads suddenly emerged from the coins before bursting into wisps of toxic smoke. He collected the smoke into a jade vial before retrieving the coins.  

"Big Bro, why didn't we attack earlier?" the lecherous cultivator grumbled. "That guy was only at the early Qi Refining stage—probably hadn’t even cultivated thirty strands of qi. We could’ve taken him easily."  

"That man had no openings—no weaknesses to exploit," the bald man replied solemnly, weighing the coins in his palm. "He was too composed."  

"In our line of work, we must keep our eyes sharp. Never strike unless victory is certain, or you’ll end up kicking an iron plate… After a few more jobs, we’ll find a cave to settle in and turn over a new leaf."  

---  

Proceeding with caution, Wang Chan soon found himself less than three miles from Lotus Mountain. Though he relaxed slightly, he didn’t let his guard down.  

The mid-grade Diamond Talisman on his chest, the low-grade Protective Talisman, the silver needles hidden in his sleeves, the low-grade Earth-Treading Talisman beneath his feet—all remained ready.  

"More and more cultivators are migrating south from Blackwater City up north," Wang Chan mused as he ran, his expression darkening. "The wilderness is bound to grow even more chaotic."  

The path he took, though remote, was considered a rural route in the cultivation world. After all, most cultivators heading toward Lotus Mountain used this road to reach the Black River Market.  

Under normal circumstances, local robber cultivators wouldn’t operate in such a place.  

*I hope Fellow Daoist Qu can truly secure that opportunity to settle in White Mountain City a month from now.*  

Wang Chan couldn’t help but mutter to himself.  

Back at Green Bamboo Mountain, neither he nor Ning Jingming had outright refused Qu Lian’s proposal. They had agreed that if Qu Lian could obtain residency permits for the city, they would discuss the matter further.  

Qu Lian hadn’t pressed them, instead suggesting they reconvene in a month—giving everyone time to prepare.  

Lost in thought, Wang Chan suddenly spotted a group of figures at a mountain pass ahead. His heart leaped into his throat, but upon closer inspection, they were patrol guards clad in white, standardized armor. He exhaled in relief.  

*Probably just a routine check.*  

The leader, a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator, looked familiar. After a moment, Wang Chan recognized him—the refined Daoist companion of the beauty-marked woman. Dressed in patrol gear, he was nearly unrecognizable.  

As Wang Chan approached, the five guards turned their attention toward him. A mid-stage Qi Refining guard with triangular eyes stepped forward, but before he could speak, a hand rested on his shoulder.  

"Captain Bai…"  

"I’ll handle this."  

The triangular-eyed man immediately halted.  

"Are you Physician Wang?" Bai called out from a distance, cupping his hands in greeting. His memory was impressive.  

"Indeed, it is I," Wang Chan replied politely, returning the gesture. "Is Fellow Daoist Bai here on official business?"  

"Just a routine inspection," Bai said with a friendly smile. "I’m afraid it’ll delay you for about ten breaths."  

"Of course, I’ll cooperate fully." Wang Chan promptly deactivated his protective barrier.  

Bai produced a mid-grade bronze mirror and waved it over Wang Chan. His casual demeanor suggested this was merely procedural.  

Wang Chan recognized this mirror—the square-faced man had used one before. It was called the [Minor Evil-Detecting Mirror], likely standard issue for patrol guards.  

Within moments, Bai put the mirror away and stepped aside. "The wilderness has grown restless lately, especially at night," he advised kindly. "Best return home early and avoid going out after dark."  

"Thank you for the warning." Wang Chan smiled, then bowed slightly to the other guards before hastening through the mountain pass.  

Only after he had vanished around the bend did one of the female guards speak up. "But Captain Tian ordered us to seal the—"  

She abruptly cut herself off, as if realizing her mistake, and covered her mouth.  

"How to report this matter to Mei’er… I trust you all understand?" Bai clasped his hands behind his back, his expression suddenly icy.  

"What matter? Captain Bai, did someone pass by just now?" The triangular-eyed guard blinked in feigned confusion.
