# Chapter 78: Body Like a Flood Dragon

Returning to his cave dwelling, Zhang Jing hastily entered the cultivation chamber after instructing Deer Thirty-Eight not to disturb him. He couldn't wait to comprehend the mysteries of the superior cultivation technique, unwilling to waste even half a moment.

Sitting cross-legged on the meditation cushion, a flicker of flame ignited the calming incense, sending wisps of white smoke curling upward. As he regulated his breathing and calmed his mind, the dormant Heart Eye Dao Seed activated, enveloping his entire body in crimson spiritual light.

With a thought, the contents of the [Flood Dragon Submerging Seas and Devouring Void True Method] emerged in his consciousness once more. The mysterious scroll depicting a dark flood dragon submerging oceans and swallowing the void slowly unfolded before him—an endless expanse of icy underworld sea where a ten-thousand-foot black-scaled flood dragon coiled and roared with soul-shaking cries, stirring terrifying waves that blotted out the sky.

As Zhang Jing's mind gradually immersed in this vision, something unexpected occurred in an unnoticed corner. The moment the scroll unfurled, the incomplete trace of Dark Flood Dragon Devouring Void Dao Rhyme within his body stirred violently before finally merging into the scroll like a swallow returning to its nest.

In that instant, it was as if a deity had possessed him. Zhang Jing's understanding of the [Flood Dragon Submerging Seas and Devouring Void True Method] deepened significantly. A jade talisman manifested:

[Flood Dragon Submerging Seas and Devouring Void True Method·Level 1 (1/300)]
Skill Trait: Body Like a Flood Dragon (Advanced)

A more complete Dao Rhyme suddenly emanated from Zhang Jing's heart, instantly suffusing his entire being. Inspired by divine insight, he instinctively opened his mouth and inhaled deeply.

A massive spiritual energy vortex slowly formed above Zhang Jing's head as vast amounts of spiritual energy poured into his body—this time completely merging with his flesh and blood! His body began transforming immediately, defying all logic as flood dragon-like power surged through his limbs, bones, muscles, organs, and even hair.

Within mere breaths, he felt that even without using any magic power, his physical body alone could crush the early Qi Refinement demonic beasts he'd encountered before. Yet the transformation continued unabated.

Simultaneously, within his dantian, spiritual energy spontaneously condensed, becoming deeper and more oppressive, faintly carrying a dangerous aura.

In the spirit beast chamber, Deer Thirty-Eight seemed to sense something extraordinary. It raised its head, staring blankly in Zhang Jing's direction before shrinking its neck with evident fear in its eyes.

The next day, Zhang Jing awoke leisurely.

Scanning his body with spiritual sense while recalling last night's cultivation experience, a wry smile soon appeared on his face. Not only had his cultivation not progressed—it had actually regressed slightly. Fortunately, he remained at the fifth level of Qi Refinement; any further regression might have driven him to despair.

However, upon reflection, he realized this regression wasn't due to failure but because after cultivating the Flood Dragon Submerging Seas and Devouring Void True Method, his spiritual energy had become several times more potent than before. Every strand felt refined to perfection—absolutely terrifying!

Take the Five Treasures Spiritual River technique for example. Compared to before, manipulating it now felt effortless, no longer like a small horse pulling a heavy cart. Moreover—Zhang Jing extended a single finger, manifesting the Ice Edge technique which shimmered with terrifying sharpness.

Under his control, accompanied by an ear-piercing shriek, the Ice Edge slashed viciously at his own arm.

Clang! A violent metallic clangor resounded as the Ice Edge shattered instantly, leaving only a faint white mark on his arm.

That afternoon, in a building at the center of Luodu Island, two powerful men occasionally glanced toward a sealed chamber with curiosity. Having completed their business and preparing to leave, they'd stayed because of one person's arrival.

"Wonder if this junior brother will succeed."
"If he dared take the overseer assessment, he must have some confidence. Though talisman crafting depends on one's state—we'll see."
"If he fails this time, he can always try next month."
"Tsk tsk, so young indeed!" Their voices carried clear envy.

Inside the chamber, Overseer Yan carefully stored the record crystal in a jade box before turning to congratulate Zhang Jing with a smile. "Junior Brother Zhang, congratulations! If I recall correctly, you're now the youngest overseer in our Luodu squad's history."

Overseer Yan's gaze held a trace of bewilderment. When they first met, Zhang Jing had been merely a third-level Qi Refinement cultivator, not even a senior member. Yet in the blink of an eye, he'd become a squad overseer like himself. At this rate, who knew what heights Zhang Jing might reach when they next met—perhaps even deputy captain? Though that was just playful speculation, witnessing such meteoric rise inevitably evoked sighs.

"Thanks to senior brother's guidance," Zhang Jing replied courteously, his heart surging with excitement. Finally becoming an overseer meant a 40% discount on cultivation resources! Previously, to afford the Flood Dragon technique, he'd reluctantly sold his precious demon cores. Now he could replenish his reserves.

As the chamber door opened revealing the smiling pair, the waiting men exchanged glances—clearly a new overseer had been born. Without hesitation, they approached with warm congratulations and small jade boxes. "Junior brother, these are small tokens of our regard—please don't refuse."

Though puzzled by the unexpected gifts from unfamiliar senior brothers, Zhang Jing quickly understood their intent. While reluctant to accept, he graciously took the offerings to avoid awkwardness. The two men relaxed visibly—this junior brother seemed approachable. Their gesture was simply to establish rapport, for they knew well what it meant to become overseer through specialized skills like talisman crafting. Such individuals were veritable gods of wealth—worth cultivating early connections with.

In the resource repository, Zhang Jing fixed an intense gaze on the female attendant, his voice unconsciously deepening. "Truly no water-attribute demon cores for sale?" Perhaps due to imperfect control after cultivating the Flood Dragon technique, his eyes carried faint traces of the Dark Flood Dragon's devouring Dao Rhyme—terrifying to behold.

The attendant nearly wept. Though appearing human, in her perception Zhang Jing had transformed into a terrifying flood dragon stirring oceans. "Senior brother, truly none! Any demon cores are snatched instantly by alchemists upon arrival," she stammered.

"Is that so?" Zhang Jing lowered his gaze, then noticing her distress, quickly restrained the leaking Dao Rhyme, returning to normal. The attendant exhaled in relief as if reborn.

"Any water-attribute spirit herbs then?"
"Yes, yes! Please wait, senior brother."

Ultimately, Zhang Jing purchased three mediocre water-attribute herbs at half price—barely better than Mistroot Ginseng. Not that he begrudged the merit points, but the repository simply had nothing better. This reminded him that spirit herbs were ultimately scarce—for rapid cultivation progress, water-attribute demon cores remained superior. His experience in Langya Commandery suggested they were relatively abundant.

Leaving the repository, Zhang Jing hurried toward the Merit Tower—where personal missions were posted.
