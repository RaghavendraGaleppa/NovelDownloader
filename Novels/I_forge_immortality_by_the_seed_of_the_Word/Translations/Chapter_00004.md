# Chapter 4: The Dark Python Devours the Void Dao Rhyme  

Time flowed steadily onward.  

Their approach to the Dragon Lake Dao Academy grew ever nearer.  

Inside the room, the hushed whispers had long since faded, replaced by an oppressive atmosphere that slowly permeated the space.  

On the faces of the young and old alike, uncertainty was written plain—though what dominated most was fear of the impending examination.  

For the vast majority, this was their one and only chance in life.  

How could they not be nervous?  

Of course, there were exceptions—  

At the center of the room, Ji Bochang and three others sat facing each other.  

Unlike those around them, their expressions were relaxed, as if the Dragon Lake Dao Academy's examination was of little concern.  

Yet upon closer inspection, one would notice a trace of solemnity in Ji Bochang's gaze.  

"So, you want me to join you?" Ji Bochang narrowed his eyes slightly.  

As he spoke, the faintly frivolous air about him gradually dissipated, replaced by a sharp, piercing intensity that made it difficult to meet his gaze.  

"Exactly." The green-robed woman, Chu Lingyun, nodded earnestly. "Brother Ji, you know as well as we do that the true test comes after entering the academy—how to establish ourselves amid the competition with geniuses from other provinces, as well as senior disciples, securing enough resources to even enter the inner court!"  

"That's right."  

Beside her, Deng An added,  

"Besides, Brother Ji, your goal must surely be one of the academy's seventy-two legacies. The Dao merits required to exchange for such a legacy are immense. How long would it take to accumulate them alone?"  

"Brother Wu, do you agree with this as well?"  

Ji Bochang pondered briefly before turning to Wu Mingyuan on his other side.  

Hearing this, Wu Mingyuan nodded in agreement.  

"Brother Ji, Lady Chu and Brother Deng speak wisely. Since we all hail from the same province, we should unite in purpose and effort. Lady Chu's elder cousin entered the outer court nine years ago and has already reached mid-stage Qi Refinement. With his guidance, our path in the outer court will be much smoother."  

An elder cousin? Mid-stage Qi Refinement?  

That was comparable to the elders in his own family.  

Ji Bochang was inwardly startled, realizing that this might actually be a good opportunity for him.  

Before his departure, his family's elders had repeatedly warned him of the fierce competition within the academy's outer court and the unimaginable difficulty of obtaining resources.  

Having reached this conclusion, Ji Bochang relaxed, returning to his usual demeanor as he flicked open his painted fan with a smile.  

"This arrangement benefits me, and with the three of you extending such a warm invitation, how could I refuse? I'll be counting on Lady Chu's assistance then."  

---  

"Haha, I knew Brother Ji wouldn't decline!"  

"Exactly, exactly!"  

Deng An and Wu Mingyuan responded with bright smiles.  

"Brother Ji, you jest—just call me Lingyun. There's no need for such formalities. The path of immortality is arduous; we should support each other."  

Chu Lingyun's delicate face flushed slightly as she replied softly.  

Watching this, Wu Mingyuan's expression darkened.  

"By the way, Lingyun," Ji Bochang suddenly recalled something, "I have a friend at Yong'an Academy with rather unique aptitude. I think he could join us—he'd be an asset in the future."  

As he spoke, Ji Bochang glanced in Zhang Jing's direction.  

He knew Zhang Jing's background well and was fully aware that his talent wasn't lacking—only resources.  

"Brother Ji, are you referring to the one you were speaking with earlier?" Deng An asked curiously.  

"Indeed."  

"Brother Ji, may I ask which family from Linshan County he belongs to, to have caught your eye?" Wu Mingyuan followed Ji Bochang's gaze—  

Only to see Zhang Jing hugging his bundle tightly, fast asleep against the wall.  

"Brother Zhang's father is merely an ordinary physician."  

Ji Bochang answered with a bitter smile.  

He understood Wu Mingyuan's implication but had no choice but to be honest.  

"Brother Ji, how about we discuss this after your 'Brother Zhang' passes the academy's examination? My elder cousin has rather high standards."  

"If he achieves a second-class evaluation during the examination, I'll personally extend the invitation."  

Chu Lingyun's gaze remained fixed on Ji Bochang as she spoke calmly.  

"I see. Very well, then."  

Seeing that the matter couldn't be pursued for now, Ji Bochang didn't press further. Instead, he thought to himself, *'Brother Zhang, I've gotten you this opportunity—you must seize it!'*  

*'In exchange, guiding me through ten—no, a hundred—painted fans wouldn't be too much, would it?'*  

Just then—  

"Brother Ji, since you have such faith in this 'Brother Zhang,' how about a wager? We've nothing better to do at the moment."  

Wu Mingyuan studied Zhang Jing again, his interest piqued.  

"What would you like to wager, Brother Wu?"  

Ji Bochang's smile faded.  

"Haha, naturally, whether Brother Zhang can pass the academy's examination."  

"And the stakes?"  

"How about ten spirit stones?" After a moment's thought, Wu Mingyuan proposed.  

He turned to Deng An and Chu Lingyun. "Would Lady Lingyun and Brother Deng care to join?"  

"No," Deng An declined.  

"Since both brothers are interested, I'd be happy to serve as witness." Chu Lingyun smiled brightly, clearly amused.  

"Twenty spirit stones. I accept the wager."  

Ji Bochang's voice was firm.  

"Twenty spirit stones! Brother Ji's boldness puts me to shame. Twenty it is!"  

"Brother Wu is truly generous."  

"Brother Ji is no less so."  

"Let the wager be just that—no hard feelings between brothers." Seeing the tension rising, Chu Lingyun quickly intervened.  

---  

*Yawn—*  

Zhang Jing stretched his neck, feeling refreshed. The mental exhaustion from activating the Dao Seed earlier had almost entirely dissipated.  

"How long was I asleep?"  

He lifted his head, noticing that most of the others were huddled together in deep slumber. Only a few remained wide-eyed, staring blankly at nothing.  

In the open space at the center, Ji Bochang and his three companions sat cross-legged with closed eyes, their postures mirroring the immortal master outside.  

"Are they cultivating?"  

Zhang Jing was baffled.  

If he remembered correctly, Instructor Liu had once said that the Dragon Lake Dao Academy prohibited candidates from possessing cultivation before the examination.  

Was this the advantage these scions of great families relied on?  

A pang of envy struck Zhang Jing's heart.  

The next moment, he shook his head. *'I have the jade talisman and the Mind's Eye Dao Seed—what is there to envy?'*  

Finding the room stifling, Zhang Jing carefully rose, stepping over the sleeping figures until he reached the door. He pulled it open and slipped outside.  

The moment he stepped out, his eyes widened.  

Before him sat a cross-legged figure—  

Yet this figure gave Zhang Jing the overwhelming illusion that it might transform into a python at any moment, swallowing clouds and exhaling mist.  

*Have I stumbled upon an immortal master's true cultivation?!*  

*Thump—thump!*  

His heart pounded uncontrollably.  

He thought of his Mind's Eye Dao Seed.  

*Better to act than to hesitate.*  

Zhang Jing slowly retreated into the cabin, closing the door until only a crack remained.  

Then, blending into the crowd, he sat down.  

*"Mind's Eye!"*  

Focusing his spirit, Zhang Jing effortlessly activated the Mind's Eye Dao Seed.  

Instantly, a phantom eye materialized in his mind, its gaze piercing through the door's crack to observe the immortal master outside.  

There—  

A black python over ten zhang in length loomed, its horns jagged, its coiled body covered in dark scales etched with mystical patterns.  

Its massive head extended slightly, continuously drawing wisps of cloud vapor into its maw.  

One breath.  

Two breaths.  

The python's imprint grew ever clearer in Zhang Jing's mind, the aura of cloud-devouring and mist-exhaling intensifying.  

On the jade talisman, golden characters slowly emerged:
