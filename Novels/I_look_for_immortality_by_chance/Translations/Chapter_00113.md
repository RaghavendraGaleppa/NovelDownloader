# Chapter 113: Robber Cultivator Tactics or Pinnacle Prowess?

Six streaks of light arrived in unison, surrounding Gu Yuan and his companions in an instant. A murderous aura instantly filled the air.

"Senior brothers and sisters, what is the meaning of this?" Bian Chuyao's expression changed slightly as she questioned the sudden appearance of the group.

Zhou Jun, Zhuang Kangsheng of Wuxiang Peak, Mo Nanlian of Yingyue Peak, Xiao Yi of Qingyan Peak, the young woman Si Rujing of Ruyi Peak, and Su Huazheng—everyone except Ji Mobai of Tiangang Peak was present.

"Meaning?" Su Huazheng sneered, his voice icy. "A mere commoner dares to compete with us for the secret realm's resources? Junior Sister Bian, has your Bian family run out of clansmen?"

Su Huazheng was the first to speak, his tone laced with disdain. His gaze at Gu Yuan burned with resentment, and even his look toward Bian Chuyao was filled with hostility.

"Su Huazheng, is this your doing?" Bian Chuyao's eyes flashed with understanding, but she still spoke up in Gu Yuan's defense. "The rules of the Liuyan Banquet have been set by the sect since ancient times—losers have no right to complain. How can this be considered proper conduct among fellow disciples?"

Her words only deepened the frowns on the others' faces, while Su Huazheng's sneer widened.

"Junior Sister Bian, Junior Brother Feng, both of you come from prominent families. You should stand with us. If you abandon this fool now, we can still share the spiritual energy of the secret realm according to each family's rightful share."

"Otherwise, don't blame us for being ruthless!" Zhou Jun sighed before his voice turned cold, issuing a stern warning.

"Senior Brother Zhou, why waste words with them?" Su Huazheng interjected, his eyes gleaming with malice. "This Bian girl is already bewitched. In my opinion, we should capture all three, break Gu Yuan's limbs, cripple his cultivation, and confine the other two here. Let them leave empty-handed as punishment!"

The suggestion immediately stirred agreement among the others. With Gu Yuan out of the picture, the competition for spiritual energy would ease significantly.

"Let's not speak of crippling cultivation," Zhuang Kangsheng of Wuxiang Peak cut in, his gaze fixed on Gu Yuan. "This is a sect-sanctioned trial, not lawless wilderness. However, if a commoner is simply outmatched and suffers severe injuries, no one can object."

"Exactly! If he lacks the skill, he has no one to blame but himself!" The others nodded in agreement.

"Junior Sister Bian, Junior Brother Feng, we're giving you one last chance. Don't make the wrong choice!" Mo Nanlian of Yingyue Peak added coldly.

Were it not for Bian and Feng's noble backgrounds, they would have already attacked. But given their status, the group restrained themselves—though the pressure they exerted was unmistakable.

As they spoke, the six unleashed their spiritual pressure, surrounding Gu Yuan and his companions like towering mountains. Bian Chuyao and Feng Anping's expressions darkened.

Feng Anping, in particular, wavered. He hadn't expected Gu Yuan to provoke such a united front. Following Bian Chuyao's lead had been impulsive. Yet, being forced into submission rankled him.

Still... six against three? These were the top talents of the sect's Qi Refining realm. If he didn't want to be expelled from the secret realm immediately, compromise seemed the only option.

His gaze flickered uncertainly toward Bian Chuyao.

Bian Chuyao, meanwhile, studied Gu Yuan. Despite the overwhelming odds, he remained eerily calm, as if the confrontation didn't concern him.

"Hey, do you have a plan? Spit it out!" she whispered urgently through a sound transmission.

Gu Yuan shook his head slightly. Instead of replying privately, he spoke aloud. "There are only two paths."

The sudden declaration startled Bian Chuyao, but she couldn't help asking, "What two paths?"

"If you leave, I'll show you all what true robber cultivator tactics look like..."

"If you stay, I'll witness firsthand what gives these so-called 'noble geniuses' the right to boast."

"Don't you think ten people is far too crowded for such a small secret realm?" Gu Yuan turned to the encircling six, baring his teeth in a grin that carried an undercurrent of menace—like the silver dragon in his sea of consciousness, brimming with malice.

Bian Chuyao blinked at his words, then at the vast expanse of the secret realm, momentarily dazed.

The six, however, erupted in fury.

"Audacious!"

"A mere commoner, lucky to have scraped a spot here, dares to act so arrogantly?" Su Huazheng spat.

The others, though acknowledging Gu Yuan's skill, were incensed by his defiance against six opponents.

"Let's teach him a lesson—he thinks too highly of himself!" Zhou Jun's expression turned icy. Done waiting for Bian Chuyao and Feng Anping's answer, his spiritual sense shot forth like a golden sword, aimed straight at Gu Yuan.

Su Huazheng, delighted, followed suit, his spiritual sense coiling like vines to join the assault.

"Strike!" Zhuang Kangsheng, Mo Nanlian, Xiao Yi, and Si Rujing attacked simultaneously. Six dazzling strands of spiritual sense tore through the air, intent on shredding Gu Yuan to pieces.

Gu Yuan merely glanced at Bian Chuyao.

Her expression shifted before she gritted her teeth. A golden fire phoenix erupted from her, soaring toward Si Rujing.

Seeing this, Feng Anping hesitated—then, with a sudden burst of recklessness, lunged at Xiao Yi.

"Hahaha! Magnificent!" Gu Yuan laughed heartily, his eyes glinting coldly as he faced the remaining four. 

"ROAR!"

A silver-scaled dragon, armored and ferocious, surged forth from his sea of consciousness, fearlessly meeting the four spiritual senses head-on.

Having devoured the silver beast-skin book, Gu Yuan's spiritual sense had grown immensely. The dragon's scales gleamed, its whiskers radiant, alive with domineering vigor.

Yet against four top-tier spiritual senses, it still seemed outmatched.

But within Gu Yuan's dantian, spiritual energy—three times that of an ordinary cultivator—roiled violently, pouring into the Minor Titan Seal.

The seal trembled, its Dao patterns glowing so brightly they seemed ready to leap free.

The strong could wield this seal to unparalleled effect—the pinnacle could achieve the impossible.

Today, Gu Yuan would crush all opposition with absolute supremacy.

"ROAR!"

The dragon's roar shook the heavens, resonating through the land, striking fear into all who heard it.

Golden swords slashed, massive vines lashed, a white tiger roared, a jade phoenix spread its wings—yet the silver dragon, now nearly corporeal, dwarfed them all in sheer size.

"ROAR!"

With another earth-shaking bellow, the dragon shattered the four spiritual senses in an instant, then turned its fury upon their owners.

The four cultivators paled.
