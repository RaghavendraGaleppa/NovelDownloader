# Chapter 297: The Great Perfection of the Five Viscera, a Comprehensive Transformation! The Duel Begins, the Grand Gathering of Water and Earth

Nangong’s family was erudite, with a long lineage and profound ancestral martial arts that formed the foundation of their standing. Li Xian desperately wanted to learn them but hesitated to ask. Firstly, he did not want to make things difficult for Nangong Liuli. Secondly, he needed time and energy for his own cultivation: the Residual Demon Spear, the Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian, and the Minor Five Elements Strange Escape.

Hearing Nangong Liuli offer to teach him martial arts voluntarily, he was deeply moved. He imagined that this sister of his must have struggled internally before violating clan rules to teach him. Li Xian wrapped his arm around her slender waist, her fragrant hair drifting, and said, "Sister Liuli, there is no need."

The more Nangong Liuli acted this way, the less he wanted to inquire. *‘Martial arts of the world, though rare, can be mastered with perseverance and determination. Since Sister Liuli treats me with sincerity, I cannot covet her martial arts,’* he thought firmly.

Nangong Liuli asked, "You don't cherish it?"

Li Xian said sincerely, "How could I not cherish the Nangong family's reputation and their profound ancestral martial arts? I just don't want to make things difficult for you."

Nangong Liuli felt her body go soft. Hearing Li Xian's heartfelt words, she couldn't help but feel tender affection, as if drinking honey and eating sugar. She said softly, "Good brother, I am very happy that you consider my feelings. But with a great disaster looming, we cannot be impulsive. With you saying this... even if I violate clan rules, I am... willing to do so."

Li Xian said, "Sister Liuli, you were originally worried about me. I have full confidence and truly do not fear poisons. Sister, please rest ass—"

He was cut off halfway. Nangong Liuli raised a finger and pressed it to his lips. "Sister insists on teaching you. Are you afraid you won't learn and will embarrass me?"

Li Xian said helplessly, "You are goading me again."

Nangong Liuli leaned her head against his chest and said softly, "Let us cooperate. Sister wants to help you."

The two walked into the inner courtyard. Nangong Liuli held the "Fire Flag," waving it east and west, arranging the surrounding Five Elements. Flowers in the courtyard shifted, water mist swirled... the scenery of the courtyard quietly changed completely.

This ensured that sound did not leak out, and energy did not flow away. Originally, Zhao Lei had intended to use the "Ten-Day Butterfly Powder" to harm Nangong Liuli beforehand. In reality... even if Li Xian hadn't stopped her, the poison powder would have found it difficult to enter the courtyard. The Five Elements circulated within the courtyard, and the airflow cycled. If external toxins invaded the house, they would be absorbed by the flowers, grass, and water.

Moreover, Nangong Liuli came from a family with deep learning; she was not just a name. Having endured several tribulations, her mindset, ability, and keenness were now completely different.

The surroundings were quiet and still. Nangong Liuli's pretty face flushed slightly. In the past, when she made such arrangements, a storm would usually follow.

Nangong Liuli taught the ancestral martial art, "Avoiding Jade True Art." The Nangong family had many branches. This "Avoiding Jade True Art" was the unique martial art of Nangong Liuli's lineage. It was even more rare.

It possessed many wonderful effects: avoiding cold, avoiding heat, avoiding toxins, avoiding the timing of heaven, avoiding the advantages of the ground, avoiding disasters, and avoiding life and death. It belonged to the "Health Cultivation Art," with its primary effect being to prolong life and nurture one's temperament. However, when practiced to the later stages, various wonderful effects would manifest, indirectly and directly enhancing martial strength.

It had a total of seven layers.

Nangong Liuli had only cultivated to the third layer, "Avoiding Toxins." This martial art was extremely time-consuming to nurture and practice, and it was difficult to achieve results in a short time. Furthermore, it required matching medicinal baths, the prescriptions for which were held by the elders of the clan... Nangong Liuli naturally did not know them. She knew that even if she passed this method to Li Xian, he would find it difficult to achieve much.

She first taught the essentials, making Li Xian memorize them strictly, explaining the major and minor points.

Li Xian memorized them one by one. Although he had not yet started practicing Avoiding Jade True Art, it was already engraved in his mind, and he had a preliminary understanding of its martial principles. Nangong Liuli then proceeded to teach the "Xun Wind Breath."

This was a derivative martial art of "Avoiding Jade True Art." The martial art Nangong Liuli truly wanted to teach was this "Xun Wind Breath." However, practicing this martial art alone made it difficult to grasp its meaning, as it involved many essential principles of "Avoiding Jade True Art."

Nangong Liuli's "Avoiding Jade True Art" and "Xun Wind Breath" had not yet fully grasped the essentials, and she dared not make decisions on her own, dismantling and patching things together. She feared it would backfire and harm Li Xian.

Thus, she took a detour, first teaching "Avoiding Jade True Art," and then teaching "Xun Wind Breath." Li Xian was secretly moved, knowing that Nangong Liuli was holding nothing back.

This twist of fate could be considered a deep connection.

Li Xian did not want to make things difficult for Nangong Liuli and secretly decided that even if he practiced "Avoiding Jade True Art," he would never reveal it easily. Nangong Liuli, however, had no such worries. Avoiding Jade True Art was very difficult, and its effects were not apparent in the early stages.

Although the later layers were powerful, few could cultivate to them.

Li Xian spent several days integrating and understanding the many principles of "Avoiding Jade True Art." Then he set about attempting to practice "Xun Wind Breath."

Xun Wind Breath was a "Breathing Martial Art," aimed at controlling the breathing through the mouth and nose to cultivate a breathing rhythm. It could use mouth and nose breathing to expel impure qi from the body and extend physical stamina. More importantly, it allowed one to breathe pure, non-toxic air even in areas shrouded in toxic mist. One could freely move through ordinary toxic mists; it could be called a rare martial art.

Furthermore, practicing "Xun Wind Breath" for a long time could prolong life and ward off evil toxins, making it difficult for external diseases to invade.

Its ability to ward off toxins was superior.

[Xun Wind Breath]
[Proficiency: 12/500 Entry Level]

Although it was a basic martial art, because it involved "Avoiding Jade True Art," it appeared quite extraordinary. Li Xian had just entered the entry level; he could only maintain "Xun Wind Breath" for a few dozen breaths. If his movements were slightly too large or his breathing slightly urgent, the Xun Wind Breath would become disordered.

Nangong Liuli also knew that if she were truly fighting an enemy, with "Xun Wind Breath" not yet deeply cultivated, it would be difficult to be effective. But she still hoped that Li Xian could gain a little more ability to resist toxins.

[You practiced Xun Wind Breath, Proficiency +1]
[You were disturbed but barely maintained Xun Wind Breath, Proficiency +2]

Speaking of the other side.

Zhao Lei returned defeated, filled with pent-up anger. She was skilled in using poison techniques, often able to torture her enemies to the point of wishing for death; she rarely suffered losses. This failure made her expression terrifyingly gloomy.

Her residence was near Hao Qingshe's. It was very simple and crude, hiding many toxins inside. She spread her palm, and a three-winged centipede crawled out from under her clothes, circling and dancing in her hand.

Its back was already growing a fourth wing. By then, her strength would advance another step; she truly did not know how she could lose.

She walked into the inner courtyard. Inside grew a "Blood Neck Tree," its trunk twisted and bright red, bare of leaves or fruit. Hanging beneath the tree were several human vessels, their tongues cut out, throats removed, and centipede venomous beasts crawling in their eye sockets.

The Centipede True Sutra was extremely evil, aiming to breed "Centipede Venomous Beasts." The human vessels she hung, four were female martial sisters from the Jianghu, captured by her and brought here. Their situation was miserable and unspeakable; their charming looks were ruined by the torture, turning into terrifying human vessels.

Two were disciples of the Flower Cage Sect.

The Blood Neck Tree was also a strange tree; its roots could connect with human meridians. It released toxins that kept the human vessels awake at all times.

Martial arts seek to make the body conform to the heavens and earth.

The "Centipede True Sutra" was to parasitize centipedes within the "Human Body Heaven and Earth." To be the master of this heaven and earth, nourished by it, and gradually undergo mutation. The six human vessels trembled slightly. Although their orifices and flesh... were all occupied by poisonous insects, their ears could not hear, their eyes could not see, their mouths could not speak... they felt the excitement of the poisonous insects throughout their bodies and knew Zhao Lei had returned.

Zhao Lei revealed a smile. She gently stroked a human vessel; inside it were nurtured thirty-nine poisonous centipedes. These centipedes passed through skin and flesh, their legs sharp, pricking the skin until blood spots appeared.

This human vessel was the most miserable and had been kept the longest. Zhao Lei was originally the daughter of a pig-killing household in an ordinary village. She was captured by bandits who entered the village and taken to the stronghold. Later, she was saved by a passing female martial sister.

She begged in every way to follow the female martial sister and learn martial arts. The female martial sister finally did not agree, but took pity on her and allowed her to follow. She planned to安置 her later if she found a good place.

Who knew that halfway, they were harassed by the Flower Cage Sect. The female martial sister was injured but beat off the bandits. Zhao Lei repaid kindness with ingratitude; she took this opportunity to secretly施毒, poisoning the female martial sister unconscious and taking her to join the Flower Cage Sect.

The Flower Cage Sect never restricted its disciples. Although they saw she was a woman, her appearance was ordinary, and she came from a poor background, they didn't bother to refuse. It was fine to accept her as a disciple. Later, after meeting with the elders, she came to the Water Altar Island. She met Hao Qingshe again and was accepted as a disciple to practice poison arts.

The beautiful female martial sister who had saved her with good intentions was thus poisoned by her, eventually hanging in the Blood Neck Tree, tortured by poisonous insects, living a life worse than death.

The other female vessels were all captured by poison. The male vessels were抓取 from the Water Altar. She liked to capture ugly men, turn them into vessels, and breed poisonous insects.

Then she would arrange marriages for the vessels.

She helped the vessels pair up and get married, setting up wedding banquets. Zhao Lei gently stroked that human vessel and laughed, "Sister Huang, in a little while, you will also be getting married. Your groom is very handsome."

Her voice contained "Chest Drum Thunder Sound." This caused resonance in the Huang surname woman. Although she could not hear, she knew the meaning of the words. Her whole body shook violently, letting out a despairing哀鸣.

Zhao Lei laughed loudly and said, "Sister Huang is really厉害, helping me breed two-winged poisonous centipedes again."

She flicked her finger into the eye socket,夹出 a two-winged centipede. Then she commanded the "Three-Winged Centipede" to swallow the two-winged centipede completely. The three-winged centipede's wings trembled slightly, its scales became even tougher, black light lingered, and the signs of a fourth wing became even more obvious.

She raised her eyebrows slightly, discovering a意外 delight. There was still a two-winged centipede hidden in the eye socket. She抓来 to feed it; the signs of four wings were now imminent. Zhao Lei felt she was only half a step away, so she simply抓来 several one-winged centipedes to feed it.

The three-winged centipede ate until its body was fat and round, unable to eat any more. It lay in her palm sleeping soundly, gradually undergoing a mutation.

Zhao Lei laughed, "Excellent! In a few days, this four-winged centipede will be complete!"

"With this poisonous centipede, among the Second Realm martial artists, who could be my match? Hahaha."

The Huang surname woman felt utter despair. She endured torture, but more than that, she felt that Zhao Lei, originally a country girl, had grown increasingly powerful and was now far superior to her. But thinking that revenge was hopeless, she wished with all her heart to commit suicide on the spot to end this life.

[Xun Wind Breath Proficiency +1]
[Residual Demon Spear Proficiency +1]

Seven days passed in a flash.

Li Xian's [Xun Wind Breath] reached [Proficient], able to maintain it for several dozen breaths. Moreover, he discovered that "Xun Wind Breath" and "Three Flowers Gathering at the Top, Spitting Pure Qi" resonated with each other.

Through a unique breathing rhythm, inhaling immediately after exhaling "Pure Qi" allowed the pure qi to flow within the body, filling the flesh and muscles with "Pure Qi." Then, by solidifying the blood and closing the pores, the pure qi was locked inside the body.

In this way... even if he was poisoned deeply, penetrating the flesh, the pure qi could dissolve it.

If he used "Xun Wind Breath" to exhale pure qi violently, it would be even more like a gust of wind sweeping through, surging and turbulent.

[Residual Demon Spear]
[Proficiency: 10636/15000 Great Perfection]

[Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian · Five Viscera Chapter]
[Proficiency: 7669/8000 Minor Achievement]

All paths were advancing steadily. The Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian was about to enter Great Perfection. The five viscera were flawless, and the effects were even more distinct.

[Shaping Bone Refined Embryo]
[Proficiency: 5/100]

While vigorously practicing martial arts, the essence of heaven and earth was digested within the body. The bone quality underwent further transformation, and the progress was gratifying.

Li Xian practiced martial arts with a calm heart. The duel was imminent. Hao Qingshe wanted to build a grand momentum to damage Shi Yufei and Yan Hao's face. The matter of the duel, having been stirred up, was known to everyone on the island.

Recently, the elders of the "Earth Altar" arrived at the Water Altar by flower boat. They had other matters to discuss but happened to encounter this event. Shi Yufei intended to make it grand, so he invited them to watch this battle together. The elders agreed happily, all curious.

The taverns and restaurants in the town were all discussing this matter.

Li Xian turned a deaf ear, his heart as calm as water. He practiced spear techniques, practiced breathing, trained the viscera internally, and practiced the Strange Five Elements Escape externally. He had absolute confidence in himself, but he did not become arrogant because of it.

In such a state of mind.

On the morning of the ninth day, Li Xian's "Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian" naturally stepped into the "Great Perfection" realm. He saw the initial scenery of martial arts and was deeply immersed in it. The Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian... was infinitely profound, mixing the feeling of nature and man, natural visualization, the myriad forms of万物, the cycle of the Five Elements, and the changes of pure and turbid.

[Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian · Five Viscera Chapter]
[Proficiency: 3/24000 Great Perfection]

[Description: You moved the turbidity of the viscera, sensed the heavens and earth, and cultivated the Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian · Five Viscera Chapter to Great Perfection. The five viscera and six bowels all gained benefits. The liver connects to the eyes, the heart connects to the tongue... you comprehended the characteristic "Five Senses Clarity." The five viscera circulated, connecting heaven and earth, and you enjoyed "Whole Body Baptism." The five viscera were strong, the mechanism was extraordinary, and you comprehended the characteristic "Transforming Miasma into Origin."]

Li Xian benefited greatly. He felt his five senses instantly sharpen. Even the slightest movement of his hair felt exceptionally clear. He possessed "Twin Pupils," and his eyesight was already terrifying. Gaining this transformation was merely adding flowers to a brocade; it was gratifying, but perhaps not worth getting excited over.

But the "ears," "tongue," "nose"... senses all gaining enhancement was an excellent improvement. He sat cross-legged in place, the five viscera flashing with five glows, undergoing the baptism of the whole body.

Strong viscera lead to a strong physique. During the whole body baptism, the hair, skin, membrane, bones... every part of the body gained opportunities for transformation. Li Xian's skin was fair, his black hair thick, and his heroic appearance became even harder to describe.

He possessed a "Perfect Physique." When he first broke free from the mud shell and revealed his true form, it was somewhat similar to now. Li Xian suddenly sensed something and raised his hand to抓取 among his hair.

Dozens of almost invisible silk threads drifted in his palm. Li Xian broke out in goosebumps, feeling both shock and fear. Relying on his current extraordinary senses, he removed all the silk threads from his hair.

He remembered the escape in the past. When Wen Caishang hugged him, she had laid down the silk threads. These silk threads were as fine as mist, with a very special texture. They were unnoticeable to the touch and wouldn't wash off. Once entangled, they were unsolvable.

Li Xian sighed softly: "If I hadn't accidentally entered the Water Altar, how could I have escaped the Madam's grasp. I underestimated the Madam too much. Fortune and misfortune are truly hard to say." Thinking of Wen Caishang's peerless charm, he couldn't help but sigh softly.

But he also felt fortunate. Since the silk threads had been discovered, with the world being so vast, Wen Caishang would find it difficult to find him.

Then, on a whim, he藏 all the silk threads into the "Heaven and Earth Box." It might be useful later.

After the whole body baptism, Li Xian suddenly paused and laughed: "How could there be such an ability?" He closed his eyes to sense, and the noisy sounds outside the vermilion door and around him came through.

It turned out...

Li Xian's fourth characteristic of the Second Realm of martial arts, "Rooted Falling Hair," was very different from others. His fallen hair had a mysterious connection with him and would inherit his five senses. And the "Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian," after being cultivated to Great Perfection, connected the five viscera to the five orifices, strengthening the five senses.

This characteristic and this martial art complemented each other. After the whole body baptism, the quality of his hair was also enhanced. Rooted Falling Hair... the roots deeply penetrated the ground.

In this way, many mysteries combined... Li Xian's five senses from the Rooted Falling Hair were significantly enhanced.

He could vaguely hear conversations, vaguely see figures, and even extend his perception into the ground, knowing the fertility of the soil and the basic conditions underground.

This transformation benefited him greatly. He also gained the "Transforming Miasma into Origin" characteristic. He could吸 the natural miasma into his body, and after being transformed by the five viscera, it反而 benefited his physique.

However, if it was a potent toxin, he could not吸 it recklessly.

[Shaping Bone Refined Embryo]
[Proficiency: 6/100]

The essence of heaven and earth was digested, and the bone quality underwent a slight transformation. Li Xian exhaled and inhaled continuously. He picked up the spear again and practiced spear techniques. Until noon, the fallen hair at the side door sensed something. Han Zisha and Tang Feng came specifically to find him.

Li Xian asked, "Elder Han, Elder Tang, what matter brings you to find me?"

Han Zisha said, "Don't play dumb."

Tang Feng laughed, "Your duel is tomorrow. The elders of the Water Altar and Earth Altar will be watching. Commander Shi ordered us to come see you, take you to familiarize yourself with the venue, and not to be nervous or flustered."

Tang Feng alone would have been enough for this matter, but Shi Yufei remembered that Li Xian had a deep relationship with Han Zisha, so he had Han Zisha come along as well. Li Xian laughed, "In that case, I thank the two elders for your care."

Han Zisha asked, "I ask you, what is your relationship with Commander Shi? He is quite concerned about this bet."

Li Xian thought: "If I make it too clear and let her know I am bluffing, she will definitely find a way to seize my bee farm and fruit orchard." He smiled faintly, "Nothing much."

Han Zisha rolled her eyes, "No one would believe that." She asked curiously, "Brother Hua, be honest with me. This elder can help you with a strategy, guaranteeing a win in this martial duel."

Tang Feng laughed, "Elder Han, stop probing. Let us take Brother Hua to see the arena and prepare for tomorrow's duel."

Han Zisha glared at him angrily, "You are being meddlesome." She was extremely curious but didn't dare to ask further.

The three walked together, heading straight to the "Training Arena" on the inner island. The surroundings were set up with banquet tables and round tables for a flowing feast, as if a banquet was about to take place.

Tang Feng laughed, "Hao Qingshe repeatedly requested that the scene be grand. Commander Shi has agreed. But your bet, if the win or loss is fast, it will be in an instant; if slow, it will only be a few hours. If it were just for this little thing to gather everyone to watch, it wouldn't make sense."

正好 the elders of the Earth Altar arrived at the Water Altar a few days ago. Commander Shi left the banquet for tomorrow. He turned the Training Arena into a Red Sleeve Stage, where there will be singing and dancing, making it very lively. At the end, he will have you and Zeng Xiaoke go up to the stage to fight.

Li Xian understood, "So that's how it is!"

Han Zisha said, "Tomorrow you will sit here." She pointed to a banquet table.

The Training Arena was draped in red silk and decorated with lanterns. Banquet tables were arranged around the arena, one table per person, with a few cushions behind the tables. Further out were round tables for a flowing feast, for the ordinary disciples holding tokens to sit.

Tang Feng said, "Tomorrow, even without the duel, it will be a grand gathering of the two altars. You can rest assured. Enjoy the food and drink in front. If you win the duel, that's best; if you lose, try to protect yourself."

"Right... you already have a beautiful wife. For such a grand occasion, you can bring her. Of course, if she is not obedient, you don't need to bring her. Otherwise, it would be embarrassing if people laugh."

Li Xian walked around the arena, got a general understanding of the environment, and returned to the Green Ox Residence to continue honing his spear techniques. At dinner in the evening, he told Nangong Liuli about the banquet tomorrow.

Nangong Liuli didn't like the Flower Cage Sect, but she was worried about Li Xian's duel and wanted to see the reality, so she was willing to attend the banquet. Li Xian laughed, "Sister Liuli, if you attend the banquet, you can't be casual. You need to serve me seriously."

Nangong Liuli scolded playfully, "Good brother, I guarantee I will boost your prestige tomorrow."

Li Xian said, "We need to rehearse tonight."

Nangong Liuli said in a charming voice, "My Lord, your concubine will massage your shoulders."

The next day.

Early morning.

The banquet between the Water Altar and Earth Altar was about to begin.

Although it was still early, disciples were already rushing to the inner island to take their seats. Li Xian and Nangong Liuli attended the banquet hand in hand, taking a carriage there. The two were a perfect match; as soon as they appeared, they caused exclamations of surprise, and others were envious. Nangong Liuli didn't dress up finely, but her black hair was like a waterfall, with hairpins and silver ornaments, her skirt swaying, her charming face radiating grace, which was hard to hide. Moreover, she came from a wealthy family, and her etiquette and posture were top-notch.

After taking their seats, charming maidservants brought grapes and delicacies on silver trays. Nangong Liuli picked up grapes with her slender fingers, carefully peeled them, and fed them to Li Xian's mouth. She knew that in the Flower Cage Sect, the more obedient the beautiful wife, the higher the master's status.

She served him attentively. Seeing the envious gazes of others, she felt a bit of joy. Li Xian drank and ate fruit with her, being very intimate and enjoying themselves. Compared to the other 'beautiful wives,' they were more intimate and natural.

After a quarter of an hour, Han Zisha, Tang Feng, Meng Han, and other elders all arrived. Meng Han cast a gloating glance.

Han Zisha was alone, while Tang Feng and Meng Han each brought two beautiful wives. Those beautiful wives were confined to their residences and rarely went out. Attending this grand gathering, although their status was low, they were willing, looking around curiously, glancing intentionally or unintentionally at Li Xian and Nangong Liuli.

The two had outstanding temperament and good looks, truly not something that could be found in the Flower Cage Sect. They ate fruit and drank wine together, like a divine couple. The other beautiful wives thought: "If only I could be like them, even if I lived in the Flower Cage Sect for hundreds of years, it would be a happy paradise, not a prison cage." They sighed quietly.

Before the banquet even began, they had already attracted much attention.

The elders took their seats one after another. Ye Cheng arrived with three beautiful wives, flirting and making a scene along the way, his face full of spring, very dissolute. His seat was near Li Xian.

Li Xian said, "Elder Ye."

Ye Cheng laughed, "Wu Cuo, how have you been lately?"

Li Xian said, "Very good, with beauties accompanying me, gold and silver are not comparable." Ye Cheng laughed heartily, "That's good, that's good. You really have some ability. This girl has a fierce temper, but you really subdued her?"

Nangong Liuli laughed, "I thank Elder Ye. If it weren't for Elder Ye, how could I have the chance to serve my Lord."

Ye Cheng saw that Nangong Liuli was sincerely submissive, serving without a trace of grievance, and said, "Good, Wu Cuo, if there's a chance someday, let's exchange experiences. Your ability is really不小."

"As soon as I saw you, I knew you were a talent. With this looks and this skill, I don't know how many women will fall for you in the future."

Nangong Liuli felt a hint of jealousy and secretly pinched Li Xian. But thinking it over, it might not be entirely wrong. Li Xian said, "Where, where. If it weren't for Elder Ye's recommendation, Wu Cuo wouldn't know where he would be rolling in the mud. Elder Ye, Wu Cuo toasts to you."

A moment later, the elders of the Earth Altar all arrived at the venue. Ye Cheng told Li Xian that a total of 'six' elders from the Earth Altar had come this time, and he introduced them to Li Xian one by one.

Li Xian memorized them silently. When Commander Shi, Yan Hao... all arrived, the banquet tables on the ground were almost full. Commander Shi glanced at Li Xian and then talked with the elder beside him.

At this time, fine wines and dishes began to be served, and graceful women played the zither and danced. Nangong Liuli suddenly tensed up, her gaze shooting towards the distance.

Li Xian had also noticed. Hao Qingshe and Zhao Lei were walking over from afar. Commander Shi said calmly, "Qingshe, sit beside me." He pointed to the banquet table on the left, which had been specially reserved.

He was worried that Hao Qingshe would act recklessly, so he arranged her beside him so he could stop her immediately if anything happened. Hao Qingshe said, "It's rare that Commander Shi still has me in his eyes." She tapped her toes lightly and floated onto the banquet table.

She didn't sit on the cushion but lay sideways on the table. Yan Hao said, "Hao Qingshe! The elders of the Earth Altar are all here. Don't be rude. Sit properly."

Commander Shi didn't want to argue, raised his hand and said, "Let her be."

Zhao Lei stood behind Hao Qingshe, her gaze sweeping around, finding Li Xian's figure, fixing on him, staring dead set. Nangong Liuli's willow brows furrowed tightly, looking at Zhao Lei.

The two women locked eyes. Zhao Lei showed even more contempt, sneered, and then looked away, continuing to stare at Li Xian.

Li Xian laughed, "No need to pay attention to her." He patted Nangong Liuli's shoulder. Nangong Liuli picked up a dish with her jade hand and fed it to Li Xian's mouth.

Zhao Lei saw the two being so intimate, a perfect match, and many people looking at them with envy. She felt an inexplicable jealousy and hatred. Her nature was already distorted. Thinking of the purpose of this trip, she felt even more unable to hold back, wishing to humiliate them in public. She urged constantly, "Commander Shi, when will the duel start? These messy dances are有什么好看的."

Shi Yufei was extremely displeased and didn't bother to理会, chatting with the Earth Altar elder beside him. Zhao Lei didn't know when to stop, relying on Hao Qingshe's support, and asked again.

Shi Yufei reprimanded, "When the time comes, it will naturally start. Why the hurry? If we martial artists only know how to use poison and fight, we will ultimately fall to the lower level, no different from poisonous insects. You should calm down and watch the dance. It is beneficial and harmless to you."

Hao Qingshe mocked, "Commander Shi watching dances and paintings is naturally top-notch. But appreciating people is mediocre. That boy is valued by Commander Shi, surely he has some similarity to Commander Shi."

"My dear disciple, when you duel later, you must not take his life. If you make Commander Shi unhappy, I won't be able to protect you."

Zhao Lei laughed, "Yes, Master, please rest assured. For Commander Shi's sake, I will naturally spare his life."

Yan Hao was extremely displeased. He was both a teacher and a friend to Li Xian. He swept his sleeve and cursed, "Mad witch." He had cursed both master and disciple.

Hao Qingshe's eyes flashed with a fierce light. The elders of the Earth Altar saw the tension in the atmosphere and didn't dare to speak up. Meng Han was secretly afraid, knowing that Hao Qingshe was unpredictable. He didn't expect her to be so persistent and actually provoke Commander Shi.

Poison arts harm others and oneself. The cultivation of poisons requires mutual devouring and killing. Those who practice poison arts are inevitably extreme and irritable, with chaotic thoughts. Hao Qingshe acted not based on preference, but on her mood at the moment. And her disciple Zhao Lei's distorted nature was even worse than hers.

Below the banquet, singing and dancing were peaceful; in the middle of the banquet, swords were drawn and daggers were ready. This continued for a long time. Many wines and meat dishes were gradually served and eaten, reaching the end.
