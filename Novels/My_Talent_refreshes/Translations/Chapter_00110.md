# Chapter 110: Killing Duan Yuewu

From Duan Yuewu's abnormal expression, Chu Ning had vaguely sensed that something was amiss. Thus, he was well-prepared for Duan Yuewu's sudden attack.

Almost simultaneously with Duan Yuewu unleashing his spell attack, several rays of light swiftly illuminated around Chu Ning. Two mid-grade defensive spells were activated at the same time. A yellow and a white protective shield directly enveloped Chu Ning's body. The opponent was at Qi Condensation Layer 9, an Artifact Forging Hall disciple, and possibly possessed secret arts of the Yin Demon Sect, so Chu Ning dared not be careless in the slightest.

Duan Yuewu, on the other hand, clearly hadn't expected Chu Ning to activate so many spell shields at once. His mouth twitched involuntarily. However, his actions were far from slow. A fork-shaped item appeared in his hand; infused with spiritual power, it glowed brightly and shot towards Chu Ning. Judging by its might, it was also a high-grade magical artifact.

At this moment, after continuously activating several layers of defense, Chu Ning finally had the opportunity to launch an attack. He didn't use the talisman ring in his hand, as the True Talisman spells within it only possessed peak low-grade power. They would be too weak against a Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivator. With a flick of his hand, Chu Ning directly unleashed two mid-grade talismans. The mid-grade talismans he had acquired from Liao Yunming earlier today were proving useful at this very moment. Simultaneously, he infused spiritual power into his right hand, sending ten fire blades shooting towards Duan Yuewu.

"You are indeed no ordinary person." Duan Yuewu was both shocked and enraged to see his spell attack blocked by Chu Ning's outer layers of shields, unable to harm him in the slightest, while Chu Ning could still launch powerful attacks. He activated the high-grade defensive magical artifact on his body, which also blocked the spell attacks coming from Chu Ning. However, in doing so, all the defensive shields around Duan Yuewu were annihilated.

At this point, Duan Yuewu raised his head, a sneer on his face. "A low-tier mid-grade defensive talisman, a low-tier mid-grade offensive talisman, a high-grade offensive magical artifact… I'd like to see what else you have…"

Duan Yuewu had only just begun speaking when his expression suddenly changed. He saw that Chu Ning had casually taken out several more mid-grade talismans.

"Damn it!" Duan Yuewu cursed, his face shifting. His body abruptly glowed with a bloody light, similar to his previous escape technique. He vanished in a flash, disappearing from his original spot. This speed was even faster than when he had pursued Chu Ning earlier. Upon seeing this, Chu Ning's heart clenched.

Without activating the mid-grade talismans in his hand, Chu Ning vanished with a flash of Thunderclap Steps, leaving his original position. At the same moment, a blood-red figure appeared where he had just stood, then immediately followed, arriving right beside him.

"You brat, today I'll kill you even if it means depleting my cultivation!" As the voice fell, Duan Yuewu's blood-red figure solidified. He had used some secret art, for one of his arms was now entirely black, glowing with a crimson light. His fingernails were about an inch long, transformed into sharp claws. He thrust directly towards Chu Ning's heart.

The low-tier mid-grade talisman's defensive shield shattered instantly under the claw of that arm. Even though Chu Ning had cultivated his tendons to be unbreakable, he dared not meet the blow directly with his body. He infused spiritual power into his Earth Spirit Bracelet with his left hand; a yellow light flashed, and a protective light shield radiating rich earth spiritual energy appeared, astonishing Duan Yuewu.

"Pop!"

The black and red demonic claw struck the yellow light shield. The yellow light shield merely trembled slightly, showing no change whatsoever.

"This…" Seeing his full-power strike, unleashed with a secret art, blocked by Chu Ning, Duan Yuewu's expression immediately changed.

"Not good!" he cried out in his heart. The black light on his right hand swiftly receded, forming a black demonic protective light around his body. At the same instant, a fiery fist struck like lightning. It was Chu Ning's Heavenly Gang Fist, infused with the power of his recent Thunderclap Steps, aimed at Duan Yuewu. Before this, there was also an attack from a high-grade magical artifact: the Blazing Flame Bracelet!

The blazing flames struck Duan Yuewu's black light, and the demonic protective light instantly vanished. The next moment, Chu Ning's fist, carrying spiritual power and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, slammed into him!

"Bang!" A dull thud echoed. The next moment, Duan Yuewu was sent flying backward, then fell limply to the ground. Even a Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivator was utterly unable to resist Chu Ning's multi-stage assault.

Chu Ning immediately formed a hand seal, and several Fireball spells followed close behind, completely incinerating Duan Yuewu's corpse. Only after completing all this did Chu Ning put away the dark dagger he had taken out from his storage bag, ready to activate at any moment. It wasn't needed.

Then, he slowly walked over. Duan Yuewu had already turned to ashes. On the ground lay only a storage bag and two magical artifacts. Fireball spells of this level evidently couldn't burn storage bags or magical artifacts.

Chu Ning picked up the storage bag and the magical artifacts. His figure flickered several times, and he disappeared from the spot.

About half an hour later, after circling twice, Chu Ning appeared near the area where he had entered the restriction earlier. He carefully found a spot that could block sight and sat down.

"Having many good items on hand truly is an advantage. Killing a Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivator with considerable means wasn't too difficult." He had indeed handled Duan Yuewu with relative ease today. Duan Yuewu, a Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivator, possessed two high-grade magical artifacts and clear demonic secret arts. Yet, Chu Ning was completely unharmed, not even getting his clothes dirty. This had to be attributed to the magical artifacts and talismans he had obtained from Elder Tong and Liao Yunming during the day.

Thinking this, Chu Ning took out Duan Yuewu's storage bag and the two magical artifacts. Of these two magical artifacts, the fork-shaped one had decent offensive power; a single strike earlier had directly broken through one of Chu Ning's low-tier mid-grade talisman defenses. The other, a black round shield-like artifact, had also directly withstood Chu Ning's low-tier mid-grade offensive talisman attacks. Chu Ning had used two low-tier mid-grade offensive talismans consecutively to break through it. Chu Ning picked them up and examined them, finding that both artifacts were clearly from the Azure Stream Sect. However, considering the opponent's identity as an Artifact Forging Hall disciple, Chu Ning wasn't surprised.

Opening the storage bag, he found it contained quite a few items. There were many materials from demonic beasts, though he didn't know if Duan Yuewu had accumulated them beforehand or acquired them after entering this restricted area. Several jade boxes contained spirit herbs, six in total. Chu Ning merely glanced at them and recognized several ingredients for peak low-grade pills. Among them, one Fiery Sun Grass could even be used to refine low-tier mid-grade pills.

Besides these, there were several hundred spirit stones and several bottles of pills. Among these pills, to his surprise, were nearly 30 Spirit Essence Pills, the kind Chu Ning had been taking recently. There were also Rejuvenation Pills and similar elixirs. What surprised Chu Ning was that there was even a bottle of the pills with rich blood fiend aura that he had acquired a few days ago.

In addition, there were some artifact forging materials. Some Chu Ning recognized, while others were unfamiliar. However, a thumb-sized black metal material and a white bead at the very end caught Chu Ning's attention. Though only thumb-sized, for such a small piece of material to be kept in a storage bag, it was clearly not ordinary. He wasn't very knowledgeable about materials, but he could vaguely tell that its quality was quite good.

Chu Ning, however, always felt that if he looked at this black material for a bit too long, it gave him a soul-stirring sensation. Thinking this, Chu Ning released his spiritual sense. To his surprise, this black metal material was not within the range of his spiritual sense.

"My spiritual sense can't detect it?" Chu Ning encountered this for the first time, a little bewildered. He picked up the small black material in his hand. Then, Chu Ning closed his eyes again and tried to sense it with his spiritual sense. The strange thing happened again. Chu Ning was clearly holding the item in his hand, yet under his spiritual sense, there was nothing in his hand. He then cautiously extended his spiritual sense towards the black material. To Chu Ning's utmost astonishment, his spiritual sense was directly swallowed after entering it. Chu Ning immediately stopped probing with his spiritual sense.

"This thing must be something special." Thinking this, Chu Ning placed the black stone into a separate storage bag.

Chu Ning then picked up the white bead, discovering it was actually a magical artifact. Chu Ning tried to infuse spiritual power into it; the white bead suddenly emitted a white light, illuminating the entire area. However, there was no other reaction.

"Could it be just an illuminating artifact?" Chu Ning muttered to himself. He then put the bead away. He separately stored the remaining demonic beast materials and artifact forging materials.

"Although I lost a few low-tier mid-grade talismans, probably worth a few hundred spirit stones, the total value of these items is more than enough to compensate." After putting all these items into his storage bag, Chu Ning stayed put, not going anywhere else. He didn't even release Ling Xiaobai, fearing the little fellow might wander off and cause trouble.

Although Chu Ning was indeed curious about the spirit seed and the Five Elements Heaven and Earth Array, his inherent caution made him suppress this curiosity. After all, he hadn't entered normally; if he were discovered again, the consequences would definitely be severe.

Hiding in a secluded spot, Chu Ning took out his Earth Spirit Crystal and jade knife, starting to cut again. Then he re-attached Earth Spirit Crystals to his Earth Spirit Bracelet. After all, inside this place, Chu Ning was unsure if there would be any other dangers. In addition, Chu Ning also cut ten more pieces as spares. Fortunately, no dangers appeared in the time that followed.

After staying for almost an entire day, from daylight until dark again, Chu Ning finally released Ling Xiaobai from his spirit beast pouch.

"Xiaobai, your divine ability is almost recovered, right?" Chu Ning looked at the little creature with anticipation.

"Almost!" Ling Xiaobai let out a soft *ying*, and Chu Ning nodded.

After waiting for another hour, Ling Xiaobai let out another *ying* towards Chu Ning. Chu Ning knew this meant Ling Xiaobai was telling him that its divine ability had recovered. He immediately stood up and walked with Ling Xiaobai to the spot where they had broken through the restriction yesterday. After thinking for a moment, Chu Ning said to Ling Xiaobai: "Don't take me out yet. Go out quietly and see if anyone is outside. If there is, come back in quickly."

Ling Xiaobai understood Chu Ning's words, darted out, and directly slipped out of the restriction. Chu Ning watched this scene, feeling a little anxious. He hoped there was no one outside this time. Otherwise, even if Ling Xiaobai came back in, he himself wouldn't be able to get out, which would be troublesome.

Soon, the little fellow's figure reappeared before Chu Ning.

"No one!" Hearing Ling Xiaobai's sound transmission, Chu Ning finally breathed a slight sigh of relief.

"Let's go out!" Chu Ning called, and Ling Xiaobai immediately jumped onto his shoulder. At the same time, a white light shone down from Ling Xiaobai's head, enveloping Chu Ning. The next moment, Ling Xiaobai shot forward, bringing Chu Ning, wrapped in white light, out of the restriction.

Upon landing, Chu Ning looked up. It was indeed the area near the edge of the mountain gate from last night. Only then did the heavy weight in Chu Ning's heart truly lift. He didn't dare let Ling Xiaobai stay outside for too long, immediately putting it back into the spirit beast pouch before quickly heading towards his courtyard.

At this moment, with his mind finally settling, countless questions arose in Chu Ning's mind. For instance, this was clearly the sect-protecting formation of the mountain gate, so why did passing through it lead to that forbidden ground? Was it the same restriction, or was there some other explanation? What was the "spirit seed" that the Yin Demon Sect cultivators mentioned in the forbidden ground? Why could only Qi Condensation stage disciples enter that forbidden ground, and why, after a period, were new people sent in? Couldn't the original disciples just stay inside and maintain the formation? Unfortunately, no one could answer any of these questions for him; he couldn't even find anyone to ask.

Of course, Chu Ning's mind wasn't entirely filled with questions. At least two things brought him some peace of mind. Firstly, the Azure Stream Sect people already knew that Yin Demon Sect disciples were lurking within the sect. They also knew their intentions, which were to enter the forbidden ground, and thus had been clearing them out before and after entering the forbidden ground. This greatly relieved Chu Ning, who had known about this but was unsure how to inform the sect.

Another thing that brought him some peace was that the sect's secret mission was better than he had imagined. Although there were some dangers, according to what the Yin Demon Sect people said earlier, the dangers within the forbidden ground mainly came from demonic beasts from different areas. And the highest grade of these demonic beasts was only high-tier first-grade. This meant they were still within the Qi Condensation stage; even if some demonic beasts were indeed quite powerful, as long as they weren't excessively strong, preparing more means should be enough. Thinking this, Chu Ning's previous worry about being chosen for the mission someday lessened slightly. Nevertheless, for Chu Ning, it was still best to avoid participating if possible.

These thoughts intertwined as Chu Ning finally returned to his courtyard. At this point, Chu Ning released Ling Xiaobai again.

"Xiaobai, from now on, you can't run in there without my permission, understand?"

"Ying!" Ling Xiaobai gave a soft squeak.

At this moment, Chu Ning recalled Ling Xiaobai's divine ability to break through restrictions. He pressed on: "Xiaobai, was that divine ability that allowed you to take me into the restriction awakened after you advanced to a high-tier first-grade demonic beast? Do you have any other divine abilities?"

"No," Ling Xiaobai whimpered defensively. Hearing Ling Xiaobai's reply, Chu Ning dropped the matter. Worried the little thing might run off again, he put it back into his spirit beast pouch. Ling Xiaobai was naturally unwilling, but at Chu Ning's insistence, it still crawled into the spirit beast pouch. Chu Ning watched Ling Xiaobai's figure disappear and shook his head.

He remembered Zhuang Yunde mentioning that the outer pavilion of the Scripture Depository mainly housed miscellaneous books, and outer disciples could access them at any time. He had originally planned to visit the Scripture Depository during the day to look for information on spirit beasts and about Ling Xiaobai, but that would have to wait for another opportunity.

After cultivating the Spirit Refining Art for a bit, Chu Ning, who hadn't closed his eyes for two days, collapsed and fell asleep.

The next morning, Chu Ning got up and arrived punctually at the outer sect entrance. Soon after, Gu Xiaoqing, Shen Zhengquan, and Lu Miaoying also arrived one after another. What slightly surprised Chu Ning was that Lu Miaoying, originally at Qi Condensation Layer 5, had now broken through to Qi Condensation Layer 6. Chu Ning wasn't the only one to notice this; Gu Xiaoqing also asked in pleasant surprise, "Junior Sister Lu, you've broken through?"

"Yes, I was stuck at Qi Condensation Layer 5 for a while. After returning to the sect two days ago, my mind and body relaxed, and I don't know why, but I just broke through," Lu Miaoying said, a hint of a smile on her face. Her smile seemed quite natural now, clearly different from the forced smiles she had worn in the market before. It was evident that breaking through made Lu Miaoying quite happy.

"That's great. Cultivation is like that; sometimes, things happen naturally, and you just break through," Gu Xiaoqing said with a smile. The two women began chatting. Shen Zhengquan also offered a few words of congratulations, then engaged in desultory conversation. Chu Ning merely said "Congratulations" and then remained silent.

Soon after, Chu Ning saw several people who had waited on the first floor of the Pavilion of One Hundred Treasures that day also appear. Then, a person who looked like a deacon piloted a spirit boat, carrying them directly into the sky. Perhaps seeing Chu Ning watching them, Gu Xiaoqing spoke up beside him: "Those few were performing a mission elsewhere. I heard they also encountered people from the Yin Demon Sect on the same day as us. One of them carried a treasure, which allowed them all to survive. They've returned to receive their rewards this time." After Gu Xiaoqing finished, Chu Ning understood why those few had also appeared at the Pavilion of One Hundred Treasures that day.

Shen Zhengquan then added: "I heard from an elder in my hall the day before yesterday that a total of five groups were attacked by the Yin Demon Sect that day. Besides our two groups, the other three groups all seemed to have perished."

"Junior Brother Shen's information is correct; I also heard it from people in my hall," Gu Xiaoqing nodded slightly, confirming the news. She then sighed slightly and said, "From now on, let's be more careful. Try to stay out of the market as much as possible, and if we must go somewhere, we should go together."

Upon hearing this, everyone fell silent for a moment. The previously relaxed atmosphere suddenly became much heavier. Although a few days had passed, they clearly hadn't forgotten the scene of their previous attack. Chu Ning listened to Gu Xiaoqing's words and secretly shook his head. He agreed with Gu Xiaoqing's other points—it was certainly better not to stray too far from the market. But as for the so-called "going together," he felt it was unnecessary. In Chu Ning's opinion, the attack that day was very likely because being together made them too obvious a target. If he went out alone and used a shapeshifting spell, the Yin Demon Sect people would have a very small chance of discovering him.

Of course, although he thought so, Chu Ning didn't voice it. As for how to specifically handle things back in Yanji Market, he would observe for a while before deciding.

After chatting for a bit, Lin Changqing appeared. He released his flying boat, carrying them into the sky. An hour later, they appeared in Yanji Market. At this moment, the market already had some people flowing through it. Lin Changqing paid no mind to the people already on the streets, piloting his flying boat directly to land in front of several shops in the market. Seeing Chu Ning and the others appear, it immediately drew envious glances from some cultivation families and rogue cultivators.

"It's great to be in a major sect!"

"Of course. Not just anyone can become an outer disciple of the Azure Stream Sect."

"I heard the Azure Stream Sect has been recruiting heavily these past two years. I wonder if anyone in my family has such a fortunate opportunity…" Amidst such discussions, Chu Ning and the others disembarked from the flying boat. He was just about to return to his own shop when Lin Changqing's voice rang in everyone's ears.

"You don't need to worry too much; the area around the market is still safe. I will also be staying in the market these days. Moreover, our sect is currently uniting with the other six sects to carry out a large-scale purge of the Yin Demon Sect disciples. We estimate that the Yin Demon Sect disciples will be mostly cleared out in about a month."

After saying these words, Lin Changqing piloted the spirit boat into the sky once more. Chu Ning and the others then each opened their shops. As Chu Ning had just stepped into his shop, a figure immediately followed.

"Shopkeeper, you're finally open! I've been waiting here since early morning. Do you have any peak low-grade talismans? I want to buy a few!" Hearing this, Chu Ning couldn't help but turn around in surprise. Someone actually came to his door asking to buy peak low-grade talismans, and even asked for several at once; this was a rare occurrence.

Turning around, Chu Ning saw an unremarkable middle-aged man. He had some impression of him; the man had probably bought talismans from him before. However, he didn't recall him ever buying peak low-grade talismans, so he wondered why he came directly to buy that grade today.
