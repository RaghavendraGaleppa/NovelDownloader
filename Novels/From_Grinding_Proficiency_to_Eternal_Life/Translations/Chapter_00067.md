# Chapter 67: The Monster

A crisp sound, like the tearing of silk, echoed through the desolate ruins of the Buddhist hall.

A sweet, cloying scent of blood suddenly rose from the残垣 (crumbling walls). The skin of the虬烛 (Dragon Candle) Monk began to peel off his body in flakes, like a snake shedding its skin.

Liu Xiong’s expression shifted. He looked up and saw a fissure had split open the monk's back. A pale, jade-like arm emerged from within the monk's body.

The jade-carved arm had a greyish-green hue under the moonlight. Its fingers were unnaturally long and slender, and webbing grew between the joints.

As the sound of the skin tearing grew more frequent, a new head broke through the skull and emerged. It was not the skull of a human, but more like a Buddhist statue crushed by a heavy object. On the left, the depressed forehead exposed wriggling, pinkish-white brain matter, while the right half of the face retained the compassionate expression of a Bodhisattva.

The new body, still clinging to bloody sinews, finally broke free from its cocoon. Under the moonlight, one could clearly see its spine twisted into a bizarre spiral.

The left shoulder blade was deformed and swollen, forming a fleshy tumor resembling a withered branch, while the right arm was half a foot shorter than a normal person's, its fingertips barely reaching its waist.

Most horrifying were the dense, protruding lumps on its chest and abdomen. Beneath the twisted and tangled muscles, a closer look revealed the outlines of countless tiny hands squirming under the skin.

Its feet resembled forcibly pieced-together lotus blossoms, with ten toes fused into three thick, short columns of flesh. The soles of its feet were split into five crimson fissures, exuding a mixture of golden and red pus with every step it took.

Two rows of symmetrical holes on the back of its neck spewed a mist of blood carrying the scent of sandalwood with each breath, staining the tattered monk's robe a mottled purple-red.

Liu Xiong, his face a mask of shock, noticed that the new body's eyes remained closed, its eyelids like a membrane covering two eyeballs that darted about beneath the surface.

When the grotesque body stood fully upright, the ruins were left with only the sizzling sound of scriptures burning flesh and a strange, crisp sound like wet wood snapping.

"It's wrong, it's wrong!"

The grotesque body suddenly let out a shrill cry, a mix of male and female voices.

The bloodshot eyeballs bulged violently beneath the skin. It stumbled, its three-toed flesh columns crushing the blue bricks, causing pus and blood to splatter in the cracks. The withered-wood-like tumor on its left shoulder trembled violently, and the muscles below its abdomen writhed incessantly, twisting like coiled snakes.

"My body-exchange resurrection technique... how did it turn out like this? How?!"

It whipped its head around, its slender, sharp fingers slicing through the membrane over its eyes. The two bloodshot eyeballs were instantly revealed. It looked toward the ruins of the Buddhist hall, at the力觉 (Power Awareness) Bodhisattva statue whose head had been shattered, and let out a furious roar.

"Power Awareness! You tricked me! You tricked me!!"

Liu Xiong's heart pounded. He finally understood. This old monk had been raising a wild, evil deity, intending to use its power to shed his aging body and be reborn.

As the monster wildly waved its gilded mace, a blast of energy erupted. The Power Awareness Bodhisattva statue turned into a cloud of fine powder, mixing with the blood mist to create an eerie, rainbow-like shimmer under the moonlight. The entire statue was pulverized, reduced to nothing but a pile of debris.

"There's still a way, there's still a way..."

The monster muttered to itself as it paced the courtyard, its three-toed feet turning the blue bricks into a spiderweb of cracks.

Suddenly, the monster-monk looked at the swordsman who had fallen not far away. It walked over and checked, only to find that the man was already lifeless.

"No good!"

It rushed into the ruins, digging through the debris to drag out the black-clad man who had wielded the chain-blade. The man's body was broken, his bones fractured, taking more breaths than he gave.

*‘This one is no good either.’*

Its movements as it rummaged through the corpse were as practiced as a butcher picking out meat. Finally, the monster-monk stopped before Liu Xiong.

A long, slender finger, dripping with brain matter, suddenly clamped down on Liu Xiong's throat.

Terrified and enraged, Liu Xiong tried to struggle, but the monster-monk's slender arm pinned him down with a single push.

"Don't move."

A strange force entered his body, making him unable to summon any strength.

The monster-monk continued to grope him while muttering to itself.

"Broken sternum, displaced and damaged internal organs, and the life force isn't very vigorous. Terrible aptitude. No good, no good... wait."

Liu Xiong's face was pale. He wanted to fight with all his might, but the monster-monk's slender, sharp arm pressed him down gently, and his body completely lost its ability to move. The muscles he could once control at will were now unresponsive, leaving him to be handled like a piece of merchandise being selected.

"Wait."

The monster-monk suddenly straightened up, a hint of surprise on its face.

"That young man, not yet twenty-one and almost at the third level of body refinement. If I were to use his body for the resurrection, I might just get a perfect vessel."

Suddenly, it turned its head. The three flesh columns on its lower body retracted sharply, then instantly shot straight.

*Thwump!*

The monster-monk shot forward like a bolt from a crossbow, arcing through the air and quickly vanishing from Liu Xiong's sight.

Xu Yunfan's toes lightly touched the ground, his figure like an arrow released from a bow, leaping and dodging among the flying eaves and arches of the Thousand Buddha Temple. With each leap, his muscle fibers would tense and relax like bowstrings, covering the twenty-meter gaps between rooftops in a single step. His breathing was long and steady, his heart beating like a war drum, pumping scorching blood to his limbs, providing him with a continuous stream of strength.

The sounds of fighting inside the temple were fading. Amidst the whistling sounds of the strong monks swinging their熟铜棍 (cast-iron clubs), the situation was being quickly brought under control. The golden light at the back of the Thousand Buddha Temple had been seen by most people, and many were already surging toward it in a frenzy. He glanced at it but paid it no further mind. His thoughts were filled with the bizarre appearance of the old monk just now, which had completely shattered his understanding of the world.

Although he knew that this world not only had martial arts but also true-blood practitioners capable of transforming into gods, the appearance of this wild, evil deity and its grotesque form was enough to make one's scalp crawl. It was best to stay as far away as possible from these things when one didn't understand them.

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan's eyes narrowed slightly. He turned his head to look at a corner not far away, where a black-clad woman and a man named Su Shiyu were fleeing in a panic, pursued by several strong monks wielding cast-iron clubs. His gaze quickly swept past them, and his speed increased a little.

This was not a place to stay for long. He would head to Changyi, the capital of Qingzhou, and then find the most famous sect in the nearest area.

His 'Lin' character mantra had been mastered, and his goal had been achieved.

As for the divine weapon, the Gilded Mace, it had beaten four or five flesh-refining realm experts into submission without them being able to fight back. To be honest, it was not something he could lay his hands on for now.

Xu Yunfan raced all the way, crossing mountains and ridges. When he reached the main road, he finally slowed his pace a little. He had been sprinting for two full hours without slowing down, and he was now at least sixty li away from the Thousand Buddha Temple, most likely having already left the boundaries of the积云 (Accumulated Clouds) Mountains.

Although the moon was high and the stars were sparse, there were still a few scattered travelers walking silently on the main road. Xu Yunfan glanced at them a few times but paid them no further attention. He readjusted the瓮金锤 (jar-shaped golden hammer) on his back, took off his waterskin to take a drink and wash his hands, then pulled out some dried rations he had prepared and began to chew slowly.

He had not walked much further when Xu Yunfan suddenly stopped. He stuffed the last piece of dried rations into his mouth and swallowed it whole.

Up ahead, a woman in a white, gauzy dress was standing on a large boulder by the side of the main road, her back to him. Her aura was distant and aloof, a coldness that seemed to emanate from her very bones. She was out of tune with the mortal world, standing there like a fallen immortal.
