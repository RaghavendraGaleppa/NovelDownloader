# Chapter 8: The Workhorse Cultivation Saga

"Then so be it, I'll work for them!"

Lu Yang quickly adjusted his mood.

"Strictly speaking, I could commit suicide and restart right now. However, the Hundred Lifetimes Book has limited pages, so restarting directly like this would be too wasteful."

Although he was now an official disciple, Lu Yang still knew little about the Primordial Saint Sect, and his knowledge of the entire cultivation world was limited to what he'd read in books. Though the thought of restarting had crossed his mind, to accumulate an advantage for his next life, he should live a bit longer in this one.

Within Bu Tian Peak, there were countless cave dwellings, yet only two places truly stood out: one was naturally the Peak Lord's cave dwelling, and the other was a tall building.

The building had nine floors, named "Merit."

Official disciples primarily conducted transactions, posted bounties, and accepted sect missions within the Merit Tower, all under the protection of the Saint Sect.

Lu Yang entered the Merit Tower and approached a counter.

"Senior Brother, may I ask if sect missions are collected here?"

"Nonsense, you... Hmm?"

As he spoke, the young Daoist at the counter first glanced casually at Lu Yang, then his eyes lit up upon seeing Lu Yang's handsome face.

The next second, a friendly smile appeared on the young Daoist's face.

"Why call me Senior Brother? My name is Zhao Xuhe, a Deacon Disciple of the Merit Hall. Junior Brother, you must be a newly admitted disciple, right? I haven't seen you before."

"This junior is Lu Yang, greetings Senior Brother."

Lu Yang quickly bowed, simultaneously activating his disciple token to verify his identity.

Zhao Xuhe looked at the token, his expression softening further and his smile growing brighter: "Excellent, excellent. Junior Brother Lu is truly a talented individual, very good indeed."

Zhao Xuhe then gazed at him with a look that made Lu Yang quite uncomfortable, before suddenly saying, "Junior Brother Lu, since you're looking for a sect mission, I happen to have a task here, or rather, a stroke of fortune I can bestow upon you. If it succeeds, it will guarantee a vast cultivation path for you in the future..."

"Really?"

Lu Yang feigned interest on the surface, but inwardly, his guard went up.

"Absolutely true! Couldn't be truer!"

Zhao Xuhe grinned, pointing towards the peak of Bu Tian Peak, saying, "The current Peak Lord intends to recruit a son-in-law for his beloved daughter. I see you're quite handsome..."

Lu Yang: "???"

I came here for a sect mission, wanting to earn money with my own two hands, through diligence and hard work. And now you're telling me to be a kept man?

"What, you're unwilling?"

Seeing Lu Yang's stiff expression, Zhao Xuhe persuaded him even more enthusiastically: "This is a boundless fortune! If you can enter the Peak Lord's cave dwelling, you'll immediately become a Foundation Establishment disciple, with contribution points, cultivation techniques, and resources in abundance. Taking this step correctly can save you sixty years of detours..."

Even though Zhao Xuhe spoke flowery words, Lu Yang remained unmoved.

In truth, if it genuinely meant being a kept man, Lu Yang wouldn't mind.

But where was this? The Primordial Saint Sect! The orthodox demonic path! With Liu Xin's past example, how could he possibly believe Zhao Xuhe's so-called offer of marriage recruitment?

There must be something wrong!

Thinking this, Lu Yang simply sighed and said, "Senior Brother Zhao, it's not that I don't want to be a live-in son-in-law, but I truly have a hidden ailment that's difficult to speak of."

Zhao Xuhe was startled upon hearing this: "A hidden ailment?"

"To be frank," Lu Yang said, looking embarrassed to speak, "this junior is afflicted with the flower-willow disease..."

As soon as these words were spoken, the eagerness on Zhao Xuhe's face instantly cooled.

Flower-willow disease itself was nothing; he had ways to cure it. The problem was, why would one contract it? The underlying reason was the key.

"Ah, what a pity."

Zhao Xuhe shook his head. No matter how handsome Lu Yang was, the Peak Lord would never allow his daughter to become a Dao companion with a man who could contract such a disease.

Lu Yang respectfully said, "This junior has troubled Senior Brother."

One doesn't strike a smiling person. Since Lu Yang was so respectful, Zhao Xuhe's expression softened somewhat. He said, "In that case, I'll pick a good mission for you."

"What kind of mission are you looking for?"

Lu Yang replied, "High contribution points, relatively safe."

Zhao Xuhe's smile remained unchanged; he had clearly anticipated this, as every new disciple desired such a mission: "I do have one here."

Having said that, he handed Lu Yang a jade slip.

"The Yin-Yang Immortal Flower requires cultivators at the Qi Condensation realm to nourish it with their vital blood and true qi to survive. Bu Tian Peak purchases it at the highest price, 150 contribution points per flower."

Zhao Xuhe said kindly, "This is a mission issued by the Peak Lord himself. There's no limit to the quantity; we'll take as many as you cultivate. Furthermore, Junior Brother, you don't need any special spiritual planting skills. The Yin-Yang Immortal Flower is extremely adaptable; as long as you plant it in your cave dwelling, it won't easily wither."

Lu Yang was somewhat tempted at first upon hearing this, but quickly shook his head again.

Seeing this, Zhao Xuhe frowned and said, "What's wrong?"

"Thank you for the guidance, Senior Brother, but..." Lu Yang looked bitter, "I still need to pay next month's cave dwelling rent, so I truly can't afford to purchase the immortal flower seeds."

"I see."

Zhao Xuhe also sighed, "I, too, came from that stage, so I understand your difficulties... Very well, I'll help you."

Then, Zhao Xuhe extended his hand: "Give me your disciple token."

Lu Yang obediently handed it over. A moment later, he was surprised to find that his token had mysteriously gained 500 contribution points!

Zhao Xuhe smiled slightly: "These are your reserve contribution points from the Three Rivers Association. You can use them whenever you need them in the future. Go buy the immortal flower seeds."

Lu Yang frowned deeply: "Senior Brother, isn't this like a cultivation technique loan? I'm afraid..."

"The Three Rivers Association is a major power within the Saint Sect's inner sect. New disciples borrowing from us can also enjoy thirty days of interest-free loans, which is much cheaper than the Saint Sect's cultivation technique loan."

"And don't you want to buy immortal flower seeds?" Zhao Xuhe said kindly and intimately, "Our Three Rivers Association has a Senior Brother who specializes in selling these. Since you've taken a loan from our Three Rivers Association, I'll put in a few good words for you, and he can sell you the immortal flower seeds at cost price..."

"There's such a good thing?" Lu Yang looked pleasantly surprised.

"Isn't it because we have a good connection, Junior Brother?" Zhao Xuhe also laughed heartily. "Otherwise, I wouldn't tell such opportunities to just anyone!"

After speaking, Zhao Xuhe took out another jade slip and handed it to Lu Yang, saying, "This is that Senior Brother's communication jade slip. I wish Junior Brother a quick fortune!"

"Many thanks, Senior Brother!"

Lu Yang departed, expressing his heartfelt gratitude.

Watching his retreating figure, Zhao Xuhe's lips curled into a cold sneer, and he immediately began searching for his next prey within the Merit Tower.

Lu Yang didn't rush to find the "reliable Senior Brother" introduced by Zhao Xuhe to buy the Yin-Yang Immortal Flowers. Instead, he first returned to his cave dwelling and then ran some calculations.

"A loan of 500 contribution points, enough to buy ten immortal flower seeds. The annual interest rate is 36%, same as the cultivation technique loan."

"Working from dawn till dusk every day, irrigating with vital blood and nourishing with spiritual qi, it's estimated it would still take a year for all of them to fully mature, earning 1500 contribution points."

"After paying rent, only 1140 contribution points would remain."

"Cultivation technique loan principal plus interest, another 460 paid, leaving 680 contribution points. Then the 500 principal plus 180 interest for the immortal flowers becomes due..."

"Gone!?"

"Where's my money?"

Puzzled, Lu Yang calculated it again. Then, he stared blankly at his hands, only regaining his senses after a long while, and burst into exasperated laughter.

Good heavens, they've got it all calculated, not even leaving me enough for food!

As expected of the Primordial Saint Sect!

As a Saint Sect disciple, one starts by incurring debt, then is constantly stretched to the limit financially by the Sect. The contribution points earned from missions are only enough for expenses.

To earn more and save money, one has to work more overtime and take on more missions.

Otherwise, with the slightest carelessness, if the financial chain breaks, the several massive loans on his back would instantly become the last straw that breaks the camel's back.

As long as you're willing to suffer, you'll have endless suffering to endure.

To put it plainly, they dangle basic necessities in front of the low-level disciples, forcing them to work themselves to death, thereby adding bricks and tiles to the glory of the Primordial Saint Sect.

"Beasts!"

Thinking of this, Lu Yang couldn't help but curse, then comforted himself:

"I work for the Saint Sect, the Saint Sect issues contribution points, loans and cave dwellings collect contribution points, so it's essentially the Saint Sect's self-production and self-sale. I'm just enjoying the benefits in the middle!"

Immediately after, Lu Yang thought of the previously kind and diligent Zhao Xuhe, and looked at the 500 contribution points loan added to his disciple token, a cold sneer forming in his heart.

"And since you're heartless, don't blame me for being unjust."

"Usurious loan? I'll be a deadbeat!"

Despite his words, the workhorse-like predicament of the Saint Sect disciples still made Lu Yang feel stifled. The more he thought about it, the more unpleasant it became, and an unnamed rage surged within him.

"...Demon?"

Just then, the curtain was pulled open. It was Yun Miaoqing, who had heard Lu Yang's cursing and thus got out of bed to check on the situation.
