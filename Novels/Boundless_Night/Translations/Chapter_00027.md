## Chapter 27: High-Level Confrontation

Xu Yueping spoke, "Xiao Qin, want to go take a look?"

"Have Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and Mu Qing gone?" Qin Ming asked. Although curious about the top-tier abnormals in the mountains, for safety's sake, he naturally prioritized security if a comparison was to be made.

Xu Yueping replied, "They've already passed our village entrance and hurried over. They received permission from the higher-ups, who said it's fine as long as they don't get too close."

"What are we waiting for then? Let's go!" Old Man Liu's spirits lifted immediately, and he was the first to declare.

Qin Ming didn't object either. Since Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and the others had gone, there was no need to be overly worried.

A moment later, the group set off and soon reached the outskirts of the great mountain. This area was already teeming with Newborns, their silhouettes swaying, all eagerly looking forward to the appearance of Crimson Cloud City's high-level figures.

Qin Ming silently stared at the donkey. It was quite similar to the one he had hunted in the mountains a few days ago. Could it be some descendant of it?

A pure white weasel sat cross-legged on the donkey's back, like an enlightened monk, silent and incredibly calm. Its eyes, capable of seeing through worldly affairs, were profound.

Qin Ming contemplated stillness and emptiness, concealing his life force, and used "blending into the light and dust" to naturally integrate himself into the crowd.

"They're here!" someone whispered. Under the night sky, a figure appeared at the edge of the snow-covered land, getting closer and clearer.

"This must be our Crimson Cloud City's high-level arrival, right?" Even the nobles couldn't remain calm, whispering and gazing into the distance.

Soon, silence fell over the area again, because it was still an abnormal.

It approached unhurriedly with elegant cat-like steps, arriving in front of the mountain forest.

It was actually a tabby cat, about three feet long and weighing several dozen jin. It wasn't walking on all fours but upright.

Qin Ming was somewhat speechless. High-level abnormals didn't seem that rare; one could see such creatures daily.

Especially, tabby cats and weasels were naturally at odds. Would these two fight in the mountains?

Many had this thought, but no one dared to speak, maintaining a nervous silence.

"I thought top-tier abnormals were similar to creatures like the Moonworm..." Old Man Liu mumbled indistinctly.

He had guarded the great mountain for decades, hearing too many legends: terrifying mountain masters, renowned birds standing for two hundred years without falling—each more mystical than the last, yet none had appeared.

"They wouldn't... turn on each other, would they?" Someone noticed something amiss.

Because the large tabby cat gracefully taking cat steps and the old weasel on the donkey's back were at daggers drawn, highly displeased, looking as if they were about to fight.

On the snow, the large tabby cat stood still, carrying a crimson longsword on its back, similar in length to its upright height. The sword had already automatically unsheathed half a foot, and for a moment, crimson glow radiated in all directions, like the legendary sunset glow, dyeing the nearby snow crimson.

The pure white weasel also lost its calm. It jumped off the donkey's back, patted the old donkey, and sent it to wait in the distance.

The pure white old weasel itself stood there, its pair of upper limbs indistinguishable from human arms. One "hand" was clasped behind its back, while the other "hand" in front held a string of prayer beads.

Dressed in pure white, it looked up at the sky, serene and ethereal, slowly twirling the beads, a faint white mist flowing out to counter the crimson glow from the other side.

Everyone was a bit stunned. Were these two beings truly not allied? They were confronting each other!

"One of them should be human, but their chosen path is different, gradually losing their human form," someone whispered.

Upon hearing this, those present felt quite unsettled. Such paths were very far from them.

Yet now, they couldn't even distinguish which was human and which was a high-level being from the great mountain.

There were many people present, including a large number of Mountain Patrolmen who had rushed there upon hearing the news. Although they guarded the endless mountain ranges, they only stayed on the periphery, never having the chance to see top-tier abnormals. Today was also an eye-opener for them.

Crimson Cloud City also saw many Newborns arrive, both old and young, some from noble families, others from powerful organizations. Looking out, they formed a dense, dark crowd.

Newborns from nearby villages and towns, the bolder ones, also rushed to observe.

In the dense forest opposite, a large number of creatures also appeared, even more numerous than on this side. All were strange races, looking particularly daunting in the dim woodland, some fiery red, some shrouded in purple mist, and emitting noisy sounds much louder than the murmurs outside.

"Be cautious, they might cause trouble over there!" Cao Long spoke, his three-meter-tall body clad in shining armor, while his hand gripped a sharp great spear.

"Aren't they supposed to have the final negotiation? Are both sides still going to fight?" Someone looked puzzled.

Mu Qing, whose body was covered by a black cloak, said, "We won't provoke trouble, but if those abnormals dare to cross the line, just fight. The higher-ups will guarantee the outcome."

At the same time, other organizations, great clans, and masters among the Mountain Patrolmen in Crimson Cloud City were also transmitting messages, telling them to fight if the situation went awry.

"It's been a long time since I've seen such a grand display. Is it about to begin? I remember the last large-scale mountain clearing operation was thirty years ago," Old Man Liu said, slightly excited, his right hand gripping his thick-backed saber.

He and Qin Ming's group arrived relatively late, standing in a rear position, which should be comparatively safer.

However, Qin Ming didn't dare to be careless. Since his side had reached a consensus and spoken those words, he was also prepared, holding his long-handled dark gold hammer.

As a tall and majestic figure appeared, all unrest was suppressed. Both the abnormals in the forest and the Newborns in the snow fell silent.

No one saw how he appeared; he just abruptly stood at the tense scene.

He was ten meters tall, his physique truly too colossal. He wore ancient, mottled armor and held a black long spear in one hand, radiating an invisible, powerful aura that intimidated the abnormals in the mountains and valleys, and even sent goosebumps across the skin of the Newborns in the snow.

Fortunately, his invisible aura quickly dissipated, or else it would have suffocated everyone.

The man's features were well-defined, sharp and distinct. He looked to be in his forties. His towering physique naturally made people think of the Juling God path.

"This must be one of Crimson Cloud City's big figures, but why haven't I seen him before?" Someone wondered.

Even direct descendants of noble families like Cao Long and Wei Zhirou were talking and asking, as they had never seen him either.

In any case, this was a very pure human, not an abnormal.

The man holding the black battle spear had his dark hair swept up, his face showing absolute resolve. He stood beside the pure white old weasel, together facing the tabby cat carrying the crimson longsword in the snow.

With his arrival, the crimson longsword, which had unsheathed itself and dyed the surroundings like a sunset glow, emitted soft hums, seemingly warning of the newcomer's power and danger.

An old Mountain Patrolman spoke, "This clarifies the situation. The ten-meter-tall colossal man is an expert invited by our Crimson Cloud City, so the weasel... er, Senior Huang, must also be on our side. They chose a different path, transforming into an alternative true form."

People nodded involuntarily. Clearly, the tabby cat carrying the crimson longsword came from the depths of the great mountain.

The ten-meter-tall giant and the foot-tall pure white weasel, twirling prayer beads, stood together in the field. This contrast was simply too great; many wanted to discuss it but dared not speak, only closing their mouths.

"Wei Mo, Brother Wei, we haven't seen each other for twenty years. You've been traveling through deep mountains and vast swamps, cultivating near forbidden lands. Are you well?" A peaceful voice rang out, extremely suddenly. No one saw clearly, but another figure appeared in the snow.

This was still a human man, appearing to be in his early forties, dressed in white, very refined and handsome. Just standing casually, he seemed to blend with the snowy landscape.

He stood beside the tabby cat carrying the crimson sword, looking at the ten-meter-tall human man opposite him.

This time, many people in the snow were completely bewildered, dumbfounded. They truly couldn't tell which side was Crimson Cloud City's high-level figures and allies.

The giant, called Wei Mo, nodded. His dull crimson-gold armor immediately clanged. He spoke, "Indeed, twenty years have passed. Ling Xu, you also show signs of aging."

People were puzzled. Why did Wei Mo say the man in white showed signs of aging? Wasn't he in his prime? It seemed people at this level had different standards for judgment.

At the same time, some people from Crimson Cloud City exclaimed.

"Ling Xu... He's the City Lord!"

Qin Ming, Old Man Liu, and the others had also been stunned multiple times, but now they finally understood which side consisted of high-level beings from the mountains and which was Crimson Cloud City's higher-ups.

In such a short time, many people's understanding had twisted several times.

The refined middle-aged man in white, Ling Xu, nodded and said, "Who can escape aging? No one can resist the passage of time, not even the most mysterious handful of top-tier beings."

Then, he looked at Wei Mo and said, "You chose to delve deep into the night fog, lingering outside boundless forbidden lands, and you're not coming back, are you?"

"Yes!" Wei Mo replied with a single word.

"I understand," Ling Xu nodded.

Many people's expressions turned grim. A few elders had heard of Wei Mo's name and knew how powerful he was back then; his body used to be much taller than it was now. Had he activated a higher level of transformation?

"Why is he standing with the abnormals from the depths of the mountain range?" a young man from Crimson Cloud City couldn't help but ask his elder in a low voice.

The elder whispered, "When one can't find their path, when hope is lost, they step into the vast, boundless night. So, among the deep mountains, vast swamps, and boundless darkness, some high-level beings, some mysterious abnormals, aren't necessarily monsters; they were once human in earlier years!"

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming also fell into a daze.

"Let's sit down and talk," Crimson Cloud City's City Lord Ling Xu said, making a gesture to invite them.

The four beings, in four very different forms, all sat in the snow, beginning their final negotiation.

However, people found that they couldn't hear their voices.

It was a high-level secret discussion; naturally, they wouldn't be allowed to listen. Letting them quietly observe from a distance was already an an opportunity for them to broaden their horizons.

It could be seen that the scene was not peaceful. Crimson glow steamed, white mist swirled, and the clothes, armor, and fur of the four beings trembled violently. There were terrifying force fields between them.

One could even see the large tabby cat directly drawing its sword, crimson light illuminating all around, too dazzling, as if a red sun was about to rise from the ground.

And the pure white old weasel seemed to be quite angered, unable to maintain its previous calm. With one hand twirling prayer beads, it slapped the snow with the other to express its displeasure.

Instantly, everyone was horrified, because they felt an earthquake; a large amount of snow on the ground was shaken into the air.

Many clearly saw that it merely gave a light pat, not truly intending to attack.

However, this indeed intensified the tense situation in the field.

Furthermore, as various abnormals in the dense forest began to roar, several other terrifying high-level beings also emerged from the great mountain.

Some stood on the great mountain, watching indifferently, while others flapped their wings to a high altitude to overlook.

Among them, one insect was most unique, because it was too brilliant, illuminating several nearby mountain peaks, and it had arrived at the edge of the great mountain.

"Moonworm!" many exclaimed.

However, outside the great mountain, opposite to it, a powerful being also appeared in the night sky. A large green bird, flowing with dazzling radiance, carried a figure in flowing feather robes. This person, high in the sky, stared at the Moonworm, possessing an exceptionally ethereal and otherworldly aura, instantly resisting the terrifying aura expanding from the Moonworm.

Qin Ming looked at the figure on the green bird and felt a pain in his head. It wasn't because of the person themselves, but because of the broad feather robes, which were like a bolt of lightning striking his heart, splitting open his dusty subconscious, allowing him to instantly see some scenes and understand the bloody events of his fourteen-year-old self.
