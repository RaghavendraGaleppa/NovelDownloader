# Chapter 68: Return to the Daytime World

The desolate desert was "offended" once more, and the entire world changed color. Sand and stones flew, night mist surged, like crashing waves striking the towering mountains along the rugged path.

Qin Ming was dumbfounded. What was this mountain lord doing? With such high capabilities, why couldn't it just take the normal route? That urine smell was far too pungent, too stimulating!

At this moment, Meng Xinghai transmitted a message to him via a secret technique: "In a few days, you can come to Scarlet Cloud City to find me for information. A thousand-year-old aristocratic family still cares about its reputation. If the Cui family changes their mind and doesn't decide to crush you in this remote place, then the problem isn't too serious."

Qin Ming looked back through the sandstorm, expressing his gratitude to the new City Lord.

Meng Xinghai, Li Qingyue, and Cui Hong quickly rushed out of the desert; the environment in this area was simply too harsh.

On the rugged path in the distance, Xu Sheng's face was grim. Why was there trouble again today? It was even worse than yesterday! He desperately wanted to quit. As an itinerant merchant, he felt it was too dangerous. This industry had no future. Forget about the team he led; even he himself was so alarmed he wanted to shout.

"Don't panic, everyone, this has nothing to do with us. We have always revered the desert..." Before Xu Sheng could finish, he felt a woman cling to his back, whimpering, her sharp nails constantly scraping his neck.

On the pitch-black path, nothing could be seen. The woman's crying was extremely chilling: "Woo... I see many shadows, I'm so scared."

Xu Sheng couldn't remain calm. He thought, *Aren't you a fiend? What are you scared of?* He was truly afraid now. The long nails on those fuzzy "delicate hands" were like iron hooks; he couldn't pry them off at all.

He made up his mind: if he could reach Scarlet Cloud City safely this time, he would immediately change professions and stop being an itinerant merchant.

...

"Aren't you afraid of being held grudges against by offending the desert so vigorously?" Qin Ming spoke, his mouth full of sand. Battling the strong winds and raging sand, he quickly pulled out a grey robe to cover his head and face.

"It's fine, I'm a member of the Esoteric Sect. I have ritual artifacts used for certain ceremonies in the desert, which allow me to pass through smoothly," the mountain boar said, wagging its small tail, stepping lightly on the yellow sand.

Qin Ming was startled. This was an Esoteric Sect member?

"Do we really need to be so drastic?" he still couldn't help but ask.

The old mountain boar said, "It's to guard against that white wolf tracking us in secret. When traveling through the desert, anyone who has performed blood sacrifice rituals before will be afraid. If it dares to come, it'll be scared to death."

Qin Ming understood the situation. The white wolf was the new Mountain Lord. It had performed some mysterious ritual in the great mountains, worshipping the tomb of a beast god, which greatly increased its cultivation.

"A beast god... died?" He looked surprised.

The miniature mountain boar said, "Just a powerful creature, who knows if it's dead or not. It might also be its fur mound, found by that white-furred old wolf. Otherwise, with that ungrateful white-eyed wolf's previous cultivation, it could only eat my farts. Now, it's my turn to flee for my life. Alas, truly the wheel of fortune turns; my luck hasn't been good these past two years."

"There's something... around us!" Qin Ming said, holding his mutton-fat jade iron saber horizontally in front of him.

All around, yellow sand surged, thick fog boiled, and shadowy figures flickered. More than a dozen teams held dark green torches, illuminating the nearby area with a sickly green, dismal light, approaching them.

The mountain boar remained calm: "It's fine. Don't be surprised; what's strange will defeat itself. I have ritual artifacts for worshipping the desert, so they won't be able to harm us."

The green torches danced, and towering beasts dozens of meters high lumbered past them, carrying a putrid stench, and even the foul smell of burning corpses.

Qin Ming remained vigilant, but eventually, he slowly adapted. Although these abnormal phenomena flickered nearby, they did not attack them. All he had to do was not look.

"You're from the Esoteric Sect. Aren't its members supposed to revere the desert, believing it to be a place connected to deities?"

The old mountain boar said, "There's more than one Esoteric Sect. Some organizations revere deities, worshiping them and visualizing them in their minds, hoping to borrow their power for their own use. Other Esoteric Sects are more ambitious, seeking to subdue those 'phenomena' or 'realms' and make them their own, becoming gods themselves."

Qin Ming was surprised, gaining new insights into the Esoteric Sect and the desert.

The old mountain boar must have joined one of the more ambitious Esoteric Sects, or it wouldn't have this attitude.

"I'm not walking anymore. My mouth is full of sand. Set up your tent; I'll take a nap here. By the way, have you really met that one-armed saber dao grandmaster?"

Qin Ming replied, "Yes, I have. He transmitted saber techniques to me through the fog, like a spiritual resonance, or a dream."

The old mountain boar's expression turned serious, and it said, "Could this be the path of an 'outsider' that has changed?"

"You've also met my master?" Qin Ming asked.

"My father met him. He personally witnessed him cleave the Mountain Lord of that time with a single saber strike. The saber light tore through the night sky, cutting off the torrential rain. It was incredibly terrifying!"

Not long after, Qin Ming asked, "You said repaying kindness and resolving a karmic debt in the mountains, but how do I not know when I saved you?"

The old mountain boar gritted its teeth and said, "That white wolf was truly insidious and ruthless. After severely wounding me, it didn't kill me immediately. Instead, it dispersed my spirituality, turning me, a dignified Mountain Lord, back into an ordinary mountain beast dominated by bestial nature. It wanted me to become blood meal for other fierce beasts in the mountains and die miserably. At that time, I was lost. My moments of lucidity each day were very brief; most of the time, I was in the state of an ordinary mountain beast. It was truly a pig falling to flat ground being bullied by dogs. I remember you, kid, even tried to shoot me with a bow and arrow back then."

Qin Ming confirmed it. It really was that mountain boar, weighing one thousand five or six hundred catties, that had relentlessly chased him.

"Fortunately, I, Old Boar, had a contingency plan. As they say, a cunning pig has three burrows. I had previously reserved a very rare spiritual substance and hid it in that second burrow—uh, that is, below the blood snake nest. After you cleared out that blood snake nest, I, in my original wild beast state, was nearby and slightly lucid. I rushed in, recovered most of my vital energy through it, and escaped the great mountains. Although you didn't intentionally save me, I did turn my luck around because of it. Since we've met by chance, let's resolve this karmic debt."

Qin Ming never expected that the blood snake nest contained no thrice-mutated blood snakes, as Old Liu suspected, but rather a pig's den even further down.

Soon, thunderous snores came from the tent buried under the yellow sand. Though it looked like a miniature boar, the commotion it made was truly immense. Large patches of dark shadows nearby seemed unable to bear it and retreated into the distance.

Of course, it was also very likely due to the terrifying, overly masculine blood qi circulating through the old mountain boar's body while it slept, which caused those abnormal phenomena to blur away.

Its nap lasted until the next day.

Now, the desert was calm and peaceful. The abnormal phenomena and thick fog had all dissipated, leaving only absolute darkness.

"Let's go!" It led the way.

Qin Ming, on the other hand, was reluctant to leave immediately, worried that Cui Hong might be waiting for him outside.

"Let's travel along the edge of the desert. I don't want to go out either," the old mountain boar said, worried that the white wolf hadn't given up and might try to ambush it outside.

Occasionally, it would come to the rugged mountain path and imitate peculiar bird calls. Then, Qin Ming saw several sparrows fly from the adjacent mountains to report the situation to it.

Qin Ming watched with envy and discussed with the old mountain boar, asking if it could help by sending a sparrow to Scarlet Cloud City, specifically to the City Lord's Mansion.

Cui Hong had searched the entire road but couldn't find Qin Ming. Afterward, he rushed off to find Cui Chongyi, truly exhausted.

"Ghost fire!" At the edge of the desert, Qin Ming whispered, noticing a hazy area in the vast desert.

"Oh, what a good place! That's a fire spring, usually concealed, but now unexpectedly exposed. It's mainly because we're close; if we were a little further, the desert's darkness would engulf everything, and we wouldn't see anything."

The old mountain boar was pleasantly surprised. This desert oasis was an ideal hiding place for it; for now, it didn't want to leave the desert.

"Meng Xinghai is from a thousand-year-old aristocratic family; he's definitely more formidable than Ling Xu. Since Golden Rooster Ridge was destroyed, this stronghold is probably not safe either. We shouldn't stay here; let's retreat soon."

As Qin Ming approached, he heard a group of people talking. This was another occasional hideout for the Golden Bandits, usually occupied by only a few ordinary bandits.

"We're going to Maple Leaf City. That Meng fellow is too troublesome; even the great Golden Bandit lords up above don't want to cross him."

"Get ready to move out. This place has been having continuous cold winds and swarms of ghosts for the past two days. Even though we're used to it, it still feels creepy."

"Count the numbers: one, two, three... ten?!"

The bandit leader immediately panicked. This place was truly just a temporary hideout, unlike Golden Rooster Ridge, which gathered a large force. Only nine people were left here. How was there one more now?

"One, two... ten!" He wasn't convinced and counted again, his hair standing on end.

The other bandits also panicked, looking at each other, all feeling that something was wrong. They had already covered the fire spring with stone slabs, leaving almost no light.

"Run!" They burst into chaos on the spot.

...

Five days later, a sparrow flew back from Scarlet Cloud City, bringing a letter. Meng Xinghai, the new City Lord of Scarlet Cloud City, informed Qin Ming that the Cui family's attitude had softened.

"Within the next few years, I cannot go to Qinghe City where the Cui family resides, nor to Thousand Stars City. I also cannot use the name Cui Chonghe and temporarily cannot claim to be a Cui family disciple. I may be able to return to the Cui family in a few years."

Qin Ming looked at the letter. The words on it were not the Cui family's original words but Meng Xinghai's interpreted and tactful reminder to him.

"What kind of place is Thousand Stars City?" he pondered. Soon, a hazy figure of a smiling girl appeared in his mind, seemingly related to Thousand Stars City.

He rubbed his aching temples, no longer dwelling on it. He needed to undergo his fourth rebirth as soon as possible, fully recover his memories, and then everything would be clear.

Qin Ming had originally planned to abandon Scarlet Cloud City and go somewhere further, but after discovering Meng Xinghai's goodwill, he believed it might be safer there.

Qin Ming knew that Meng Xinghai's help was likely not out of valuing talent, as they had only met once. There was no need for him to intervene in the Cui family's internal affairs.

"Thank you, Li Qingyue." Qin Ming stood by the fire spring in the desert, gazing at the pitch-black night in the distance.

At the same time, in the City Lord's Mansion of Scarlet Cloud City, Li Qingyue was talking with Meng Xinghai about Qin Ming.

"Given his current situation, it's not advisable for those of us familiar with him to get too close. Otherwise, his situation might worsen. However, after he leaves the Cui family, those familiar with him, some so-called 'friends,' will likely avoid him like the plague and sever all ties, becoming strangers."

...

Qin Ming stayed in this desert oasis for eleven days before preparing to set off for Scarlet Cloud City.

Cui Hong did indeed wander outside the desert with Cui Chongyi for several days, hoping to see Qin Ming again, but ultimately failed to.

"Take care, and I wish you will someday regain your position as the Mountain Lord of Black and White Mountain," Qin Ming said, bidding farewell to the old mountain boar.

"Forget it," the old mountain boar said, shaking its head with an enlightened expression. "I've seen through it. That Black and White Mountain place simply cannot be held without earth-shattering power. After all, it once suffocated all sides, and even though it collapsed, it's not a place ordinary beings can inhabit. Almost every successive Mountain Lord has met a bad end."

"This place isn't bad either," it continued. "I'll just pretend to be an ordinary pig, lurking in the pitch-black desert. No one can harm me. For a gentleman, revenge is never too late, even after a hundred years."

Qin Ming set off, and two days later, he neared Scarlet Cloud City. Looking out, it was resplendent, suggesting that the fire springs within the city were of a high grade, ensuring it remained bright as day during the shallow night.

As he approached the city, Qin Ming's emotions surged. Although it was his first time in this place, he felt no sense of unfamiliarity.

Many blurry scenes emerged in his mind; those were his past experiences in the colossal Qinghe City.

After lurking in the dark, remote regions for two years, he had returned to a city with "daylight."

Qin Ming's thoughts were stirred. In recent days, fragmented memories in his mind had been constantly reassembling, and some people and events were slowly being recalled.

"When I was Cui Chonghe, I had many old acquaintances in Qinghe City, knew important members of many great clans, and even befriended some 'outsiders.' I interacted with direct descendants of several thousand-year-old aristocratic families. A large number of friends once gathered around me; friends were everywhere."

With a sigh, he reflected: now, returning to the world with "daylight" as Qin Ming, if he were to meet old acquaintances, how many would remain his old friends? How many would still be willing to greet him? Perhaps even if they met, they would no longer recognize each other.
