# Chapter 35: Infiltration

Facing the inquiries from the outer disciples, Gu Mo answered fluently. Upon receiving his confirmation, several immediately expressed their willingness to join the Spirit Plant Hall.

The treatment equivalent to that of an outer disciple was enough to change many people's choices. Although obtaining this treatment required passing a test, it remained highly attractive. Gaining outer disciple status and owning a spiritual field of one's own represented a genuine opportunity to change one's destiny.

Of course, some of the more confident outer disciples still chose to specialize in alchemy, artifact forging, formations, or talismans, as they believed the ceiling for spirit farmers was too low.

Gu Mo wasn't concerned about this. Not only spirit farmers but even spirit plant cultivators were considered among the lowest ranks in the hundred arts of cultivation, far inferior to the four major professions of alchemy, artifact forging, formations, and talismans.

However, this was only true at lower levels. Any profession, once reaching higher tiers, would become highly sought after.

Take spirit plant cultivators, for example. The widely cultivated Jade Spirit Rice in the cultivation world today was developed by a master spirit plant cultivator. All cultivators who now enjoy spiritual rice should be grateful to this master.

After gathering the outer disciples willing to join the Spirit Plant Hall, Gu Mo handed them over to Mai Yunfa, who was in charge of recruitment. Gu Mo was only there to help with promotion.

"Excellent, excellent!"

Mai Yunfa was thrilled that people wanted to join the Spirit Plant Hall so soon after their arrival. He began imagining the rewards Elder Zhao would give him upon the successful completion of this recruitment mission.

Gu Mo then set out again, actively inviting outer disciples from the outer disciple district, including those who hadn't yet reached the Qi Refining stage.

The initiative shown by a senior from the Spirit Plant Hall, coupled with the promise of outer disciple treatment, was an irresistible temptation for many outer disciples. Except for those with firm goals, many expressed their willingness to join.

"Mai Yunfa, isn't your Spirit Plant Hall going a bit too far?" Disciples from other peaks responsible for recruitment complained upon noticing the situation.

Thanks to Gu Mo's efforts, nearly 40% of the outer disciples had expressed interest in joining the Spirit Plant Hall. While the alchemy, artifact forging, formations, and talisman peaks weren't worried—they never lacked applicants—other peaks were struggling.

"You're free to recruit as well. I'm not stopping you," Mai Yunfa retorted smugly, exhilarated by the prospect of securing 40% of the new recruits for his hall.

"Hmph!" 

The disciples from other peaks, rebuffed, could only snort in frustration and fall silent.

They would have liked to emulate the Spirit Plant Hall's recruitment tactics, but without the resources to offer outer disciple treatment to new recruits, they couldn't compete. The Spirit Plant Hall had unused spiritual fields to offer, but other peaks lacked such incentives. 

For instance, the Beast Taming Peak's outer disciple treatment included receiving a spiritual beast or a pseudo-spiritual beast with potential. However, they couldn't offer this to outer disciples—there were more outer disciples than spiritual beasts. New recruits would have to perform menial tasks for years before possibly receiving an ordinary pseudo-spiritual beast. 

Under these circumstances, the Beast Taming Peak couldn't compete with the Spirit Plant Hall and could only watch helplessly as they poached recruits.

In an ordinary courtyard within the outer disciple district, a high-level isolation array concealed the presence of two figures shrouded in black mist.

"Senior Brother, here are the names from the past few years," said the figure on the right, presenting over a dozen jade slips, each inscribed with a name—including Gu Mo's.

"Good," the figure on the left nodded approvingly after glancing at the slips.

"Senior Brother, why are we infiltrating these outer disciples? Wouldn't targeting inner disciples be more effective?" The right figure voiced his confusion, seeing his senior's satisfaction.

Their sect had migrated from a distant land, desperate for a spiritual vein to settle. However, all viable spiritual veins were either occupied by major sects or powerful demonic beasts, leaving none unclaimed.

To ensure their sect's survival, they had to seize another sect's spiritual vein. After careful consideration, the Qinglu Sect became their target.

Among the top sects in this cultivation world, Qinglu Sect possessed a fourth-tier spiritual vein but lacked a Nascent Soul cultivator to defend it. Decades ago, their Nascent Soul ancestor had perished in an ancient ruin—an event witnessed by other Nascent Soul cultivators, confirming its truth.

Thus, Qinglu Sect was the weakest among the major sects. However, seizing a Nascent Soul-level sect's spiritual vein wasn't easy. Even without a Nascent Soul cultivator, Qinglu Sect's grand formation could withstand such an assault.

Moreover, as outsiders, a direct attack might provoke intervention from other local sects. After careful deliberation, infiltrating and dismantling Qinglu Sect from within became the optimal strategy.

The right figure believed targeting higher-ranking inner disciples would be more effective, but for now, they were only infiltrating the overlooked outer disciples.

"A thousand-mile dike collapses due to ant holes. Outer disciples may seem insignificant, but they are the easiest to infiltrate and form the foundation of Qinglu Sect's various industries. To truly weaken a major sect, we must erode it from the base," the left figure explained patiently, in good spirits.

What he didn't mention was that if they could infiltrate inner disciples, they wouldn't bother with outer disciples. But Qinglu Sect, as a millennium-old Nascent Soul sect, had measures to protect its core disciples.

The two of them had only infiltrated Qinglu's middle and lower ranks after great effort. Reaching the upper echelons would take time, but they had patience. Taking over a Nascent Soul sect couldn't be rushed.

From his observations, Qinglu Sect wouldn't produce a new Nascent Soul cultivator within a century—they had ample time.

Besides, he hadn't said he wasn't attempting to infiltrate inner disciples. Such sensitive operations were beyond his junior's clearance. The junior's task was simply to infiltrate outer disciples.

"I understand now, Senior Brother!" The right figure bowed respectfully.

"By the way, are there any promising candidates among these outer disciples worth nurturing?" The left figure toyed with the jade slips. Though outer disciples were insignificant, discovering and cultivating a few talented individuals might yield unexpected benefits in the future.
