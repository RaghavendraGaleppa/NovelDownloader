# Chapter 352: The Wish is to Be Called "Big Sister"

"Are you waiting for someone?"

Shang Qinqing sat down with a smile, casually picking up a skewer of grilled meat.

"No."

Seeing that Shang Qinqing was alone, Ying Bing seemed to be acting as if nothing was wrong as she pursed her lips slightly.

"He didn't come back with you?"

"No, he still has some matters to handle."

Shang Qinqing shook her head.

*Tsk*, what did that brat Mo say before? He said he would never deceive her, with a look as firm as a rock.

Yet, in the next moment, he told me that for the sake of... *surprise*, it was a white lie.

"Um..."

A slender hand quietly pulled the grill plate in front of her away.

"?"

Shang Qinqing was left speechless as she watched this.

So, because I didn't bring back your husband-supporting battle spirit, I don't even deserve to eat skewers anymore?

"Admit it, you miss him."

"So that's it, it's because Young Master Li has been gone for too long."

As an experienced woman, the shop owner figured out the reason instantly.

"..."

Ying Bing's cheeks moved slightly, her face remaining an expressionless block of ice. "These skewers are quite fragrant."

"Little Bing'er, look at your big-headed doll, its head is almost bald from you rubbing it. It's shiny and polished."

Shang Qinqing refused to give up.

Ying Bing tilted her head.

*The ice block doesn't quite understand what you're talking about.jpg*.

"By the way, Young Master Li has been gone for so long without a single message. Could something have happened to him?" the shop owner pondered.

"!"

Ying Bing's eyelashes trembled, and she almost dropped the skewer in her hand.

Grinding her teeth, Shang Qinqing suddenly had a flash of inspiration. She put on a hesitant expression, with a tone that said, "I don't want to say this, but I have to tell you."

"After all, he went to snatch something right from the jaws of the Demonic Sect..."

Ying Bing froze, and her jade-like face finally changed.

That's right. Li Mo had gone to gather the Power of All Living Beings, and the Power of All Living Beings in the Southern Frontier had always been secretly controlled by the Summoning Demonic Sect.

The Summoning Demonic Sect was ancient and involved in many complicated affairs. This was evident from the fact that a single Hundred Beasts Hall could stir up so much trouble in the Southern Frontier.

Even among the Nine Heavens, who were known as the supreme powerhouses of their previous lifetime, some had vague connections to the sect.

If they saw Li Mo as a thorn in their side...

Ying Bing shot to her feet.

"How is he now? Where is he?"

"Hmph, see, I told you so."

Shang Qinqing sighed.

"Go pack your things and come back with me to the Azure Labyrinth Clan's territory to see for yourself. I worked so hard, and you won't even let me eat a skewer. Really..."

But she didn't even finish her sentence.

Ying Bing had already lifted her skirt and rushed to the second floor, pushing open the door to the room.

Instantly.

Her gaze, which had been filled with a chilling aura but was unfocused, suddenly focused. She was stunned as she looked at everything inside the room.

The coolness in her eyes was illuminated by a few faint candle lights. The candles were stuck in a cake, and standing next to the cake was a person.

"You... weren't you..."

"Happy birthday. Surprise, right?"

Li Mo laughed heartily.

After her initial shock, Ying Bing's gaze grew deep as she looked at him.

"When did you get back?"

"Just now. I asked Clan Leader Shang to call you up."

Li Mo waved her over to blow out the candles, but he noticed the ice block's expression was a bit off, her chest heaving slightly.

The culprit, Shang Qinqing, had quietly followed her up. She had wanted to watch a sweet scene, but a glance showed her things were a bit different from what she had imagined.

Oh no...

She had only acted on a whim earlier.

She wouldn't have made things worse by trying to be clever, would she?

"Ahem, Li Mo, you're also in the wrong here. If you want to give a surprise, just give a surprise. If it's for a birthday, just say it's for a birthday. Why did you have me help you trick Little Bing'er? That's a bit too much, don't you think?"

Shang Qinqing became serious.

---

Li Mo: "???"

"This candle... should I blow it out?" Ying Bing looked at the cake on the table.

"Yes, and you can make a wish before you blow it out."

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and gently blew.

*Huff—*

It didn't go out.

This damn candle had surprisingly good quality. It had gone out, but the wind from the window blew in, and it struggled back to life.

Don't reignite at a time like this!

"Ice block, don't tell me you made some outrageous wish?"

Little Li asked, completely bewildered.

"I wished for you to never lie to me again."

Ying Bing looked at him with a profound gaze.

"..."

Li Mo felt somewhat wronged, not knowing what Shang Qinqing had just said to the ice block.

"Maybe my yang energy is too strong lately, even the candles I light are burning so stubbornly. Try again..."

This time, the candle finally went out.

"What did you wish for this time..."

"Call me Big Sister."

"Call you Big Sister and then I'll tell you? Uh... Actually, wishes don't come true if you say them out loud. It's fine if you don't tell me."

Li Mo smacked his lips, his mouth being the hardest part of his body.

Actually, I don't really want to know. Besides, you're only two months older than me. Are you really...

"The wish is for you to call me Big Sister," Ying Bing said calmly.

This brat Li Mo, whose mouth was harder than a hammer, trembled.

He couldn't hold it in. His mouth immediately had a mind of its own and surrendered without a fight.

"...Big... Sister."

"Be good from now on."

Ying Bing raised her face and tied back her scattered black hair.

"Try it. I refined this in a pill furnace. It should taste pretty good."

Li Mo held the Red Dawn Sword as if he were about to cut it in half.

The picture on the cake was of a girl reading under a tree, with a boy watching her.

But just at that moment.

A slender finger抢先沾了下蛋糕边缘, dabbed some cream, and smeared it onto his face.

"?????"

Little Li, whose philtrum was now itchy, turned his head. Only then did he see clearly.

The ice block's eyes, which had not been playful just a moment ago, clearly hid a sense of pleasure.

She was genuinely anxious at first, but that changed the moment she saw him. At least, it had changed by the time she was blowing out the candles.

She was actually very happy to see him.

But she also wanted to hear him call her Big Sister, so...

*Gasp!!*

"Ice block, you did that on purpose?"

Li Mo felt that this guess was ninety percent likely to be true.

"Did what on purpose?"

Ying Bing furrowed her beautiful brows, seriously maintaining her cold and stern demeanor.

"Alright, it's your birthday, so you're the boss today."

Best Actor Li suspected this was the acting of a Best Actress, but he had no proof.

Wait.

He had proof!

Li Mo discovered that at some point, a soft, fragrant little hand had appeared in his palm!

When did she hold my hand?!

"..."

Ying Bing, who was cutting the cake, was also confused.

She didn't know when she had given him her hand.

She didn't even know if she had offered it, or if at some point, he had just taken it.

"Hehe, the taste is just right. By the way, what flavor is this cake? It smells great. Let me have a taste and see if it's as sweet as you two."

Shang Qinqing shuddered. If she didn't eat some cake to suppress it, she was afraid she wouldn't be able to help rolling around on the ground.
