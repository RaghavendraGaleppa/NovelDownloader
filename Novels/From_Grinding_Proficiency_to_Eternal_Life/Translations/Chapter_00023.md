# Chapter 23: Practitioners of Hardened Body Training

Fang Mushan gripped his long spear and thrust forward violently. The tip of the spear, like a nimble dragon's head, carried a sharp gust of wind as it plunged straight into the heart of the enemy formation.

The spear moved with his body, and his body turned with the spear. Every swing brought forth a flurry of light and shadows. The spear tassel spun, resembling flashing dragon scales with a chilling glint.

With the death of Xu Yunfan, who had reached the pinnacle of the First Stage of Body Tempering, Fang Mushan, with his innate talent, was like entering an unmanned territory among these soldiers whose formation had been thrown into chaos.

Wherever he went, enemies fell one after another, either flipped into the air by the spear tip or swept off their feet by the shaft, causing a chorus of screams in an instant.

However, a veteran quickly shouted, "Form the formation!" Despite the chaos and the continuous deaths of several men, the soldiers forcefully formed a semi-circle, with long spears at the front and mixed sword-and-shield warriors behind.

Seeing this, Fang Mushan couldn't help but feel somewhat restricted. He flicked his long spear, charging left and striking right, but achieved little effect.

The battlefield was different from a solo duel in the Jianghu; attacks came from all directions. If one wasn't careful, even a Grandmaster of the Three External Unifications could perish.

Fang Mushan gritted his teeth.

*If I were fully armored, these people before me would be nothing but chickens and dogs...*

Although he called them chickens and dogs, the thirty elite soldiers dispatched by Zhang Shuyang were at least at the entry level of martial arts.

Strictly speaking, the fact that Fang Mushan could fight alone for so long was enough to show his physical constitution was astonishing.

On Xu Yunfan's side, he propped himself up with one hand and leaped out of the hole. He casually grabbed the long sword at Xu Yun's waist and swung it at Yang Gan above.

He naturally didn't know how to use a sword, but the special effect of having extraordinary arm strength allowed him to wield the sword with the force of a heavy weapon.

Yang Gan narrowed his eyes slightly, his hands hanging down as he stood motionless, merely tilting his head slightly to let the long sword fall onto his shoulder and neck.

*Clang!*

A sharp sound of metal clashing rang out. Xu Yunfan was surprised to find that the long sword in his hand couldn't penetrate even a fraction.

Only then did Li Haomiao's voice drift up leisurely from the underground cave.

"This person practices the Black Body Iron Armor. When cultivated to perfection, his entire skin is like wearing a suit of armor, and his tendons are dense like a green python coiled around his body. Ordinary blades cannot harm him. If you had a heavy hammer in your hand, you could beat him easily."

Hearing Li Haomiao belittle him to nothingness, the corner of Yang Gan's eye twitched slightly. Just as he was about to speak, Xu Yunfan suddenly raised his leg, aiming straight for his groin. The attack was fierce, causing the air to let out a "whoosh" sound.

"What fierce power!"

Yang Gan's pupils contracted violently. This kick came too fast and too urgently, leaving him no room for carelessness.

Years of combat experience made him instinctively clamp his thighs inward, barely blocking this fatal blow.

"Why are you clamping your legs together like a woman?"

Xu Yunfan sneered with mockery at the corner of his mouth, but his hand movements didn't slow down in the slightest.

Before the words had fully faded, he decisively let go of the long sword, instantly forming a fist. He stepped forward, and his fist, carrying a whistling wind, swung straight toward Yang Gan's temple.

For hardened body training, if one hasn't reached the extreme of skin tempering and hasn't displayed the golden skin state, there will always be a weak point, no matter what.

These weak points, nine times out of ten, are located in vital parts of the human body, such as the eyes, groin, back of the head, navel, and temples.

Hearing Xu Yunfan's sharp taunt, a flash of shame and anger passed through Yang Gan's eyes.

The action he had just used to block Xu Yunfan's kick was indeed somewhat like that of a shy daughter. For a big man of nearly two meters tall, this was hitting his sore spot and severely damaging his self-esteem.

"You're seeking death!"

Yang Gan roared. Facing Xu Yunfan's heavy punch, instead of retreating, he advanced.

He raised his large hand and拨开 (deflected) it precisely, blocking Xu Yunfan's attack. At the same time, his other arm bent into an elbow, like a sharp battle axe, viciously hooking upward toward Xu Yunfan's chin.

If this connected solidly, even if Xu Yunfan wasn't injured, he would be left dizzy and dazed.

Xu Yunfan's mind suddenly cleared, secretly reproaching himself for still lacking too much combat experience.

If both sides are practitioners of hardened body training, as long as you can daze the opponent and slow their movements, you can easily attack their vital points and kill them with a single blow.

The two instantly fell into a fierce melee. Fists and feet flew back and forth. Aside from their vital areas, they abandoned all defense on other parts, both using all their skills and attacking the other with all their might.

Yang Gan grew more alarmed as he fought.

His hardened body training was already perfected. Ordinary blades couldn't harm him in the slightest, and punches and kicks were like tickling to him.

But Xu Yunfan's fists came over like thousand-pound hammers. Each one shook his internal organs, making him extremely uncomfortable.

This forced him to start defending. Otherwise, with the repeated hammering of his internal organs, he might really be shaken to death by Xu Yunfan.

Although his hardened body was perfected and his skin was as hard as iron armor, he was only at the peak of the First Stage of Body Tempering. Although he had touched upon muscles and bones, he was far from the Three External Unifications, let alone the marrow and internal organs. His internal organs were still fragile and tender. Being continuously shaken by hammer techniques, he naturally couldn't take it.

Xu Yunfan keenly sensed the change in Yang Gan's attacks. Seeing that he kept blocking Xu Yunfan's attacks toward his chest, Xu Yunfan understood immediately that Yang Gan was afraid of the hammer technique from his hands.

Without any more hesitation, his fists rained down on Yang Gan like a storm.

Relying on the special effect of extraordinary arm strength, every punch of his weighed a thousand pounds, like a mountain pressing down.

Yang Gan was beaten back step by step. In the end, his blocking arms had gone numb, his blood and energy were flowing sluggishly, and his movements had slowed down significantly.

"Wait, I have something to say!"

Yang Gan finally couldn't hold on and had to speak.

If this continued, he might really be beaten to death by Xu Yunfan on the spot, and the thought of retreating had already萌生 (sprouted) in his heart.

But Xu Yunfan turned a deaf ear, and his fist锋 (edge) became even more fierce. Every time he swung his fist, it seemed to tear the air, bringing up a chilling whoosh.

Yang Gan was both shocked and angry, wanting to break away from the fight.

How could Xu Yunfan let him escape easily? Seizing the moment the opponent stepped back, his figure flashed, and he quickly closed in, grabbing Yang Gan in a tight bear hug.

Immediately after, he exerted force with his waist and abdomen, bursting with astonishing strength, and actually lifted this nearly three-hundred-pound big man into the air, then threw him down heavily.

*Thud!*

A dull sound. Yang Gan crashed to the ground, letting out a muffled groan, blood overflowing from the corners of his mouth.

However, his movements were not affected in the slightest. He quickly twisted his body and kicked his legs, breaking free from Xu Yunfan's embrace, then rolled on the ground several times before standing up.

"He's still not dead after that?!"

Xu Yunfan was full of surprise. At this moment, he finally understood why Li Haomiao said martial artists who practice hardened body training are a group of troublesome sticky plasters.

At the same realm, if one doesn't have a divine weapon or sharp blade in hand, as long as the opponent strictly guards their weak points and doesn't suffer a serious injury, one can only exhaust them by force.
