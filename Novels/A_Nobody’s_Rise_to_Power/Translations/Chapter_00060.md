Chapter 60: Moving In

Since returning to the mountain, Yang Can naturally had to meet with his subordinates.

"Wangcai!" As soon as he entered the courtyard, Yang Can called out.

Wangcai was sitting on the corridor with Laixi, chatting about something that had them both laughing loudly. Hearing Yang Can's voice, he looked up sharply. Seeing that his master had returned, Wangcai jumped to his feet.

Yang Can watched as Wangcai ran up to him like a loyal dog and said with a smile, "Go and have the kitchen prepare a banquet. Tonight, I will be hosting all the stewards of the outer estate."

He then glanced at Laixi. "Xi, you go and inform all the stewards for me."

Ever since Qiaoshe had been assigned to serve him, Laixi no longer had to stay in the courtyard every day. Laixi didn't feel like he had fallen out of favor; on the contrary, he enjoyed it. Whenever he had free time, he would run next door to find Wangcai to play. In any case, as long as the Young Mistress called out, he could hear her even over the wall.

The two youths immediately scampered off. The master was hosting a banquet—this was great news. There would surely be plenty of leftovers and grease to be had.

Yang Can had set out from Feng'an Village early in the morning and arrived at Phoenix Mountain Villa in the afternoon. He had met with the Clan Head and Suo Chanzhi, and his meeting with Suo Chanzhi had been particularly long. Thus, it was already late afternoon, with the setting sun casting its slanting rays and the sky filled with rosy clouds.

Upon learning that the Second Steward had extended an invitation, the stewards gladly accepted. It was only at the banquet that they learned Yang Can had also concurrently taken on the role of Feng'an Village's chief. For a moment, the looks everyone gave Yang Can were rather complex.

On one hand, it was quite enviable that Yang Can, as the Second Steward of the main branch, was now also concurrently the chief of Feng'an Village. Holding a high position upstairs while also grasping real power downstairs—who wouldn't be envious?

On the other hand, anyone could see that Feng'an Village was currently plagued with many troubles. If one weren't careful, they could easily get stuck there.

However, these were all shrewd individuals; they naturally wouldn't speak too deeply to someone they didn't know well.

"Steward Yang possesses great talent! He actually improved the plow and became famous throughout the world!" Steward Niu raised his cup and proposed a toast regarding Yang Can's invention.

As for Yang Can concurrently serving as chief of Feng'an Village, offering congratulations felt inappropriate, and offering warnings was even more unsuitable, so they could only gloss over it.

"Indeed, indeed! Steward Yang's deed is of immeasurable merit! We should drink to that!" The stewards all raised their cups to toast Yang Can.

After three rounds of drinks, the atmosphere in the席 was at its height when suddenly the jingle of pendants was heard. A steward facing the door squinted through his drunken haze and couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh! Madam Pan?"

Everyone turned their heads to see Madam Pan standing gracefully in the interplay of light and shadow just outside the doorway. She wore a crabapple-red dress, her cloud-like hair slightly loose with a golden hairpin slanted in it. Under the lamplight, her watery eyes seemed to flow with charm, exuding an enchanting allure.

Upon seeing her, the stewards scrambled to their feet with a clatter.

Pan Xiaowan smiled sweetly. "I heard that the Second Steward has returned to the mountain and is hosting a banquet for all the stewards tonight. Coincidentally, a relative sent some fresh seasonal produce up the mountain, so I prepared a few small dishes."

She raised her hand to tidy the hair at her temples, her charming eyes fixed on Yang Can. "I've brought them now to help liven up the drinking for Steward Yang and all the stewards, as a small token of my appreciation."

Pan Xiaowan spoke softly and sweetly, gesturing to Qiaoshe and Laixi behind her. Qiaoshe and Laixi hurriedly stepped forward with food boxes to serve the dishes.

Pan Xiaowan took out a small bowl from among them and smiled gently. "The family's milk cream is running low; this bowl of ghee is all that could be made. Since the Second Steward is rarely back, please accept it personally... and taste it."

Yang Can quickly left his seat and stepped forward to receive the ghee with both hands. "Madam has gone to great trouble; I am immensely grateful."

Their eyes met for a fleeting moment and then separated. To outsiders, it appeared very proper. Only in that instant of eye contact could they feel the undercurrent of entanglement flowing between them.

Pan Xiaowan handed over the porcelain bowl, her fingertips brushing lightly against Yang Can's hand. In a voice only the two could hear, she murmured coquettishly, "You heartless little rascal!"

Yang Can lowered his head to take the bowl, his voice equally soft. "Sister-in-law, stop it."

Pan Xiaowan gave a soft snort and shot him a playful glare. As soon as she placed the ghee in Yang Can's hands, she immediately took a step back, acting extremely proper and graceful.

"Well then, everyone, please enjoy yourselves. I won't disturb you any longer."

She cast another lingering glance at Yang Can, then left with Qiaoshe and Laixi.

The banquet grew lively again. Especially with the addition of several steaming hot dishes, the guests' enthusiasm for drinking increased. The stewards all praised Madam Pan for being thoughtful and considerate, beautiful and kind-hearted, and for maintaining her virtue and managing the household well while her husband was away on inspection.

Yang Can held his spoon, savoring the "ghee," merely listening with a faint smile.

When the moon was halfway across the sky and its clear light covered the ground, the banquet finally dispersed. It was too late to clean up the mess on the table, and Yang Can didn't wake the dozing Wangcai. After seeing the guests off, he simply bolted the courtyard gate.

He glanced back at the wall, where a large lotus-patterned urn made it easy to climb. On top of the wall, an apricot tree was in full bloom, its blossoms nearly fading. Standing on tiptoe to look over the wall, he saw that the lamp in Pan Xiaowan's bedroom was still lit, like a pair of drowsy, affectionate eyes.

Yang Can shook his head gently. He naturally understood Madam Xiaowan's feelings, but back when things could have progressed naturally, he had held back. He certainly wouldn't now climb the wall to pluck that apricot blossom.

Yang Can's figure quietly disappeared through the doorway. The apricot blossoms on the branch, stirred by the wind, fell like rain.

Yang Can only stayed one night at Phoenix Mountain Villa. His focus was now on Feng'an Village. His foundation had to be laid there, developing steadily and quietly.

Upon rushing back to Feng'an Village, Yang Can immediately sent someone to invite Zhang Yunyi.

Zhang Yunyi was still nominally the chief of Feng'an Village, though he was already under the control of Leopard Head and Kang Zhengyang.

"This time back at the mountain, I met with the Clan Head and explained the situation here. The Clan Head's intention is..." Yang Can deliberately paused, but seeing Zhang Yunyi's overly calm reaction, he continued. "Since you, Chief, were able to uphold justice and eliminate the scoundrels, though you were negligent in your duties, you will not be severely punished. You will be demoted to Deputy Chief. Let bygones be bygones."

Zhang Yunyi silently took a step back, lifted the hem of his robe, and knelt. "Thank you, Steward Yang, for your mercy."

Yang Can shook his head. "I want Feng'an Village to be safe and sound. The autumn harvest this year must be no lower than previous years. Can you do this, Chief Zhang?"

Zhang Yunyi said, "I cannot say for sure what the weather will be this year, but with the effect of the new plow you created, I have confidence."

"Good!" Yang Can nodded. This was the result he wanted.

A group of people who had been entrenched in Feng'an Village for many years—killing them wouldn't allow the village to transition smoothly without any turmoil. But once there was turmoil, it would give the Second Master a handle to use against him.

Therefore, Yang Can had rounded up all the stewards of Feng'an Village, but kept Zhang Yunyi's signboard standing there. His purpose was to ensure that Feng'an Village's agricultural production wouldn't be greatly affected by earth-shattering changes during the spring plowing and sowing seasons.

Yang Can then looked at Kang Zhengyang. "Kang Zhengyang, you are loyal and brave in your duties, and the Clan Head greatly appreciates this. The troops of Feng'an Village will still be under your command. You must train them diligently and protect the safety of the manor."

Kang Zhengyang expressed his thanks with great joy. All the stewards of Feng'an Village except him had been arrested—was he really so clean? Regardless, until this moment, his heart was finally at ease.

Qingmei stood to one side, her dark eyes darting. *And me? Why is there no arrangement for me? He will be stationed in Feng'an Village and won't be returning to Phoenix Mountain Villa for the time being. So, what will I do? Should I go back to serve my young lady, or... ahem... stay and serve my young master?*

Yang Can pondered for a moment. "As for the other stewards in the village..." His expression darkened slightly. "Anyone with blood on their hands must not be spared. For those who can be retained, Chief Zhang, you must strictly discipline them."

Zhang Yunyi agreed calmly. For many years, his only obsession was to expand and strengthen the Zhang family. Now, he didn't even care about the Zhang family anymore. All his past beliefs and shackles had become a joke. To him, everything he once cherished and held fast to was worthless. He could now sing about "not caring" at all.

Zhang Yunyi said respectfully, "Feng'an Fortress is the last line of defense for our village against bandits and refugees. It was built with the manpower and resources of the entire village; it is not my personal property. I will move out of Feng'an Fortress within three days to make room for you, Chief."

Yang Can nodded and didn't stand on ceremony with him. He had indeed taken a liking to this manor. He couldn't very well let Zhang Yunyi continue living there while he built another house outside. Who would be the real boss of Feng'an Village then? From now on, he would be the sky and the king of Feng'an! No, not just that. The five other villages and three pastures would also be in his pocket.

Steward Wantai was standing guard outside. Seeing Zhang Yunyi come out, he immediately stepped forward. "Master, how did it go?"

Zhang Yunyi smiled faintly. "The Clan Head still has use for me. I've been made Deputy Chief, so it's a case of being raised high but put down gently."

Wantai breathed a sigh of relief. Zhang Yunyi said, "Pack up our private wealth and movable assets. We will withdraw from Feng'an Fortress within three days."

Wantai was taken aback. "Master, then... where will we settle?"

Zhang Yunyi narrowed his eyes. "Uncle Xiaomi's house, though it can't compare to Feng'an Fortress, is still enough to settle our family. Let's move there. From now on, Uncle Xiaomi's house will be my residence."

"But... what about Uncle Xiaomi's family..."

Zhang Yunyi said coldly, "Uncle Xiaomi originally didn't have a roof over his head. Now, he can just go back to how he was."

Wantai acknowledged the order, then suddenly remembered something and hurriedly took two steps forward. "Master, a batch of mountain goods is about to pass through our territory. With such a big incident happening in the village, should we notify them..."

"No, there's no need!" A chilling, venomous smile appeared on Chief Zhang's face. "Since Heaven has bestowed wealth and honor upon Yang Can, I must see if he has the fate to enjoy it!"
