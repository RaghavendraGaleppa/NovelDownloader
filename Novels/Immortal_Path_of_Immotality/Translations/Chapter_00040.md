# Chapter 40: The Depths of Dongting Lake  

The large boat rowed downstream along the river, and within half a day, it had ventured hundreds of miles deep into Dongting Lake.  

Along the way, the lake surface was littered with wreckage of various boats, while the islands they passed were strewn with corpses and broken blades, with faint plumes of smoke rising into the sky.  

Clearly, after a month of fierce battles, countless lives had been lost—all for the sake of securing the innate Vermilion Fruit for those in power.  

The Twelve Linked Water Forts lived up to their reputation as water bandits who had repeatedly repelled government sieges. Their strength and resilience were formidable, as they managed to hold their ground despite the relentless assaults from numerous factions.  

By dusk, the boat arrived at a nameless islet in the center of Dongting Lake. Lush and verdant, with towering vegetation, the island spanned about ten square miles.  

The surrounding waters were densely packed with boats of all sizes, but aside from the crew, no martial artists were aboard—evidently, they had all gone ashore for the final battle.  

"Good, we're not too late."  

Jiang the Protector spotted two groups locked in fierce combat on a distant shoal, while thick smoke billowed from somewhere deeper on the island.  

Lin Shan directed the crew to moor alongside the other boats. Without needing to dock, the group simply walked across the connected vessels to reach the shore.  

Ren Wukuang of the Bladed Fist Sect glanced around and, seeing that Lin Shan and his companion had no intention of letting them leave, reluctantly led his men to follow them onto the island.  

Entering the dense forest, they found corpses, bloodstains, and weapons scattered everywhere—hidden in the grass, hanging from trees. The dead wore various uniforms, indicating that many sects had fallen into ambushes here, suffering heavy losses.  

Lin Shan and the others proceeded cautiously, wary of hidden arrows that might strike at any moment. His spiritual sense only covered a ten-step radius, leaving him blind to threats beyond that.  

After a few hundred steps, the sounds of battle grew louder ahead. Jiang the Protector signaled, and Lin Shan and the Bladed Fist Sect members understood, creeping forward quietly.  

They hid about thirty feet away, observing the fierce skirmish in the forest ahead.  

The ambushed group wore yellow robes with short sleeves. While dodging arrows from afar and the trees, they fought back against an unending stream of attackers. The ambushers, burly men in gray vests, wielded ghost-headed blades with ruthless precision, their eyes fierce and their strikes deadly.  

"The yellow robes are from the Divine Fist Sect, a major faction from Wuling. The gray vests are the water bandits of the Twelve Linked Water Forts," Ren Wukuang whispered, identifying the two sides.  

The battle raged on. Under the command of their protectors and elders, the Divine Fist Sect members fought desperately to break free. But the water bandits, seemingly unafraid of death, held their ground, determined to pin them down.

At the center of another battlefield in the distance, two figures moved like dragons and phoenixes, darting between trees and branches as they clashed. Their palms and fists were shrouded in mist, sending leaves swirling around them.  

Two innate masters were locked in a life-or-death duel!  

"That's Wu Yingxiong, the Grand Elder of the Divine Fist Sect, fighting the Sixth Commander of the Twelve Linked Water Forts. Both are renowned innate masters," Ren Wukuang explained, proving his broad knowledge despite his youth.  

Lin Shan and Jiang the Protector watched for a while, realizing that with hundreds of combatants on each side, the forest battle would drag on.  

According to intelligence from Three-Headed Fort, the innate Vermilion Fruit was set to ripen tonight. The Twelve Linked Water Forts were stalling at all costs, and the Divine Fist Sect's Grand Elder couldn't quickly defeat the Sixth Commander.  

"We can't wait any longer!"  

The crimson sunset filtered through the trees, casting dappled red light on the forest floor.  

Lin Shan exchanged a glance with Jiang the Protector, and with a nod, they charged into the fray.  

If they waited for the battle to conclude, the opportunity would be lost. The Grand Elder might be sacrificing himself to tie down the Sixth Commander while his sect leader ventured deeper into the island. Staying put would be sheer stupidity.  

At this point, everyone was here for the same prize, and survival was secondary.  

Lin Shan had no room for mercy—when it was time to carve a path, he would cut down gods and buddhas alike.  

---  

The two battling groups suddenly found themselves in chaos as green blades of light shot from the island's edge, cutting down friend and foe alike.  

A shadowy figure in black darted through the battlefield, claiming lives with each lightning-fast slash.  

The Bladed Fist Sect members had no choice but to join the fight, compelled by Lin Shan's icy glare. Ren Wukuang could only comply.  

By the time half the combatants had fallen, the Grand Elder and the Sixth Commander finally ceased their duel, reaching a temporary truce.  

They couldn't afford to let this new force slaughter their remaining men—without subordinates, they'd be at a disadvantage.  

"Bladed Fist Sect! The Divine Fist Sect has no quarrel with you. Why this slaughter?" the Grand Elder shouted.  

Ren Wukuang opened his mouth to explain, but Lin Shan raised his hand and unleashed three gleaming wind blades straight at the elder.  

"Enough talk! Clear the path with your men. These two innate masters are ours."  

With that, Lin Shan leaped onto a treetop and attacked.  

---  

The Bladed Fist Sect dared not disobey, fearing decapitation by wind blades if they hesitated. They gritted their teeth and charged forward, turning the battlefield into a three-way melee.  

"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"  

Lin Shan darted between trees, his wind blades precise and relentless, forcing the Grand Elder and the Sixth Commander into an ever-shrinking space.  

The two innate masters were in dire straits—not only could they barely see their attacker, but the green blades were terrifyingly powerful.  

Their first attempt to block with their weapons ended in shattered blades, sending them fleeing in panic.  

But the wind blades sliced through trees like butter, leaving no cover. The two fled as Lin Shan mindlessly leveled the forest behind them.  

After a dozen wind blades, the area was cleared—only stumps remained under the golden-red twilight.  

The two innate masters stood drenched in sweat, their faces flushed with fear.  

"You run fast," Lin Shan remarked calmly as he stepped into the clearing. His white robes seemed stained with blood in the fading light.  

He raised a finger, and a three-foot-wide wind blade materialized.  

Without trees for cover, they were fish on a chopping board.  

The Grand Elder's face twisted in despair. "You're an immor—"  

His words were cut short as the wind blade tore through him, painting the sky red.  

The Sixth Commander, seeing his doom, turned and fled deeper into the island.  

But before he took five steps, a flash of steel reflected the red sunlight, blinding him. His head tumbled from his shoulders before he could react.  

"Impressive work, assassin," Lin Shan praised Jiang the Protector. "How's the front?"  

Jiang wiped his blade clean on a corpse, eyes fixed on his prized weapon. "The Bladed Fist Sect is still fighting the others below."  

Lin Shan sat cross-legged on a stump, replenishing his spiritual energy. "Go help them. End it quickly."  

Without a word, Jiang vanished back into the forest.  

Lin Shan had expended nearly twenty wind blades in the battle—only a sixth of his reserves, but this was just the beginning.  

Greater battles might lie ahead, and he needed every drop of spiritual energy he could muster.  

---  

Had it not been for the forest's cover, he could have slain the two with far less effort. Unlike Jiang the Protector, who had his treasured blade, they stood no chance against the razor-sharp wind blades.
