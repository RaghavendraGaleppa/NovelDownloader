# Chapter 351: Absorbing True Qi

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over the disciples of the Five Major Sects like a blade, a cold, indifferent smile playing on his lips.

The fragments of the Zhenlong Seal beneath his feet emitted a faint cracking sound, reminding everyone that the battle just now had not been a contest, but a one-sided crushing!

The Purple Robed Elder of the Nine曜 Sect subconsciously tightened his grip on the "Great Sun Meteor Core" hidden in his sleeve, his knuckles turning white, yet he dared not activate it for a long time.

The Daoist of the Xuanzhen Sect beside him had cold sweat beading on his forehead. The talisman in his hand had long been soaked with sweat, causing the cinnabar runes to blur slightly.

The Sword Cultivators of the Jiangnan Sword Pavilion were even paler. Their swords trembled slightly in their scabbards, seemingly terrified of the figure on the stage!

The envoy of the Penglai Pavilion felt his throat tighten. This chain,号称 capable of locking dragons, could not be thrown out!

He opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but found his voice stuck in his throat, unable to utter a single word.

The remaining high monks of the Mituo Temple pressed their palms together, their eyes flickering beneath half-lowered eyelids. They had intended to suppress Xu Yunfan with the "Three Talismans Locking Demon Formation," but now the formation's core was broken, and Ci Ku, Ci Nan, and Ci E had barely grown cold. Who would dare step forward to die?

For a time, around the vast Xuanwu Arena, not a single person dared to respond!

Xu Yunfan sneered at the sight and lightly tapped his hammers together.

A dull *clang* rang out, like thunder exploding in everyone's hearts, forcing the disciples of the Five Major Sects to take a step back in unison!

"Since no one else wishes to discuss the 'Three-in-One'... then I shall graciously accept the title of Champion of the Imperial Martial Arts Tournament."

Before his words had fully faded, a majestic Xuanhuang Qi surged up from the earth's veins, coiling around him like a giant dragon.

The elders of the Five Major Sects changed expressions drastically. They clearly felt that the dragon vein qi of the Jade Capital was converging toward Xu Yunfan at a visible speed!

This Dao Sect direct disciple, who had risen abruptly, not only suppressed the heroes with martial force but also began to plunder the Great Zhou's national fortune before everyone's eyes!

The Xuanhuang Qi churned like an angry dragon, erupting from the depths of the earth's veins and transforming into nine streams of solid golden light that completely engulfed Xu Yunfan.

Shadows of mountain ranges and river lines faintly appeared within the qi pillars. Every strand of Xuanhuang Qi carried the essence of the Great Zhou's national fortune accumulated over centuries. The moment it touched his skin, it surged in wildly like rivers returning to the sea!

Xu Yunfan's Dragon Scale Armor rang with a sharp hum under the scouring of the Xuanhuang Qi, and blinding golden light burst forth from the gaps between the scales.

His muscles and bones became visible within the qi waves; his tendons were like twisted golden silk, his bones emitted a jade-like luster, and his internal organs, washed by the Xuanhuang Qi,透出 a halo like colored glaze.

The Ten Extremities True Qi surged through his flesh and blood like a great river, refining the influx of Xuanhuang Qi entirely into purer and more abundant true qi.

The pupils of the Five Major Sects' elders contracted violently.

They saw Xu Yunfan's every pore breathing in and out the Xuanhuang Qi, and tiny whirlpools condensing among his hair strands.

Even more terrifying was that the floor tiles beneath his feet were decaying and cracking at a visible speed.

"The origin of the earth's vein is being forcibly extracted..."

The Xuanzhen Sect Daoist looked extremely unsightly. He vaguely felt that escorting the Great Zhou Imperial Court this time was a mistake.

The Xu Yunfan before them was no ordinary person. Just where did Bi Yuan find such a monster? Could it be...

The Xuanzhen Sect Daoist's eyes trembled slightly, as if想到了 something, his face instantly turning deathly pale.

The clouds above the Jade Capital had strangely rotated into a funnel shape, with the center of the cloud vortex directly above Xu Yunfan's Heavenly Spirit, as if the heavens and earth were bestowing a transmission of power upon him.

"Bone Marrow Washing and Bone Changing, the Physical Body Attains Divinity," a woman from the Penglai Pavilion said in a hoarse voice.

Ordinary martial artists absorbing Xuanhuang Qi would be fortunate to get a strand or two, yet Xu Yunfan swallowed it like a bottomless abyss.

His spine bones glowed with golden light segment by segment, a phenomenon of the Golden Body realm, the grand perfection of the Mituo Temple's secret Muscle and Bone Marrow Washing Technique.

This scene made the high monks of the Mituo Temple look extremely grim. The Mituo Temple had not seen a Luohan who had cultivated the Muscle and Bone Marrow Washing Technique to perfection and achieved the Golden Body realm for hundreds of years, yet now they saw the signs in this great demon, Xu Yunfan.

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan's eyes snapped open.

Golden light flashed in his eyes like lightning, actually splitting the Spirit Suppressing Jade Pillar three zhang away.

He opened his mouth and let out a long howl. The true qi he exhaled coiled around him, circled for a moment, and then钻回 his seven orifices.

In the next instant, the Spirit Suppressing Jade stones around the arena shattered simultaneously.

The masters of the Five Major Sects changed expressions drastically, feeling the true qi flowing through their flesh and blood being torn by an invisible force. The true qi they had cultivated for decades surged uncontrollably toward Xu Yunfan like floodwaters breaching a dam!

This man was not just plundering the earth's vein; he had begun to forcibly assimilate the very essence of their martial arts!

" How dare you!" The Nine曜 Sect Purple Robed Elder's hair and beard bristled, his eyes filled with shock and fury.

He pushed his palms toward his lower abdomen as if pushing a mountain.

His vital energy and blood instantly congealed like mercury, building a wall of bronze and iron within his body to forcibly seal and suppress the leakage of true qi.

The other sect masters followed suit, each employing their methods to stabilize the true qi within their bodies.

"What dare I not?" Xu Yunfan said with a smile on his face, secretly glancing at the attribute panel in his vision where a new effect had appeared under the Ten Extremities Martial Way after accepting the infusion of Xuanhuang Qi.

*Absorbing True Qi!*

It could absorb the true qi of others and turn it into its own use.

The Ten Extremities Martial Way encompassed the characteristics of the six major sects and could easily assimilate them.

Xu Yunfan's pores opened all over his body, and the Ten Extremities True Qi formed countless tiny devouring whirlpools within him.

This was not simple plundering of true qi, but rather using the Mixed Origin True Seed as a hub to completely decompose and reorganize the foreign true qi. The Vajra strength of the Buddhist sect, the Pure Yang breath of the Xuanzhen Sect, the sharp sword qi of the Sword Pavilion—once they entered his body, they were brutally crushed in origin by the Ten Extremities Martial Way, then refined through the circulation of his flesh and blood, becoming a part of his own true qi!

The masters of the Five Major Sects turned deathly pale. The true qi they had cultivated for decades was being sucked out by Xu Yunfan's terrifying devouring whirlpools formed with every breath.

The true qi that had been forcibly locked down began to seep out from everyone's pores in wisps and strands, condensing into pale golden mist bands in the air, converging into his flesh and blood like rivers returning to the sea!

Even more terrifying was that these extracted true qi still carried the characteristic imprints of their respective martial arts.

The Great Sun True Flame of the Nine曜 Sect, the Dragon and Tiger Dao Rhyme of the Xuanzhen Sect, the Vajra Zen Meaning of the Mituo Temple—all were brutally dismantled in the furnace of the Ten Extremities True Qi, ultimately becoming nutrients to nourish Xu Yunfan!

"The martial way this boy cultivates..." The Purple Robed Elder's gums bled, his voice trembling, "is clearly a devouring demon art that steals the creations of heaven and earth!"

Ordinary martial artists forcibly absorbing different true qi would suffer from chaotic vital energy and blood at best, or explode and die at worst.

But Xu Yunfan's Ten Extremities Martial Way was like a bottomless abyss, accepting everything that came.

The Buddhist sect's ferocity? Neutralized by soft strength! The Xuanzhen Sect's hardness and softness? Broken by force! The Sword Pavilion's sharpness? Bound by entangling strength! The martial characteristics of the six major sects had all become stepping stones for the Ten Extremities Martial Way to reach the pinnacle!

As the devouring intensified, faint golden whirlpool patterns appeared on Xu Yunfan's surface, and the blue bricks beneath his feet silently turned to dust.
