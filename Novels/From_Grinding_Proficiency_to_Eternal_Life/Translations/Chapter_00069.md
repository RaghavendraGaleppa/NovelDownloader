# Chapter 69: Three Breaths

Wan Miaoqing let out a soft laugh. The specks of blood on her chin only served to accentuate her peculiar beauty.

She immediately closed her eyes and ceased speaking, silently regulating her breathing to seize the time and recover her qi.

Meanwhile, the old monk let out a hoarse roar, his expression manic as he desperately wriggled toward Wan Miaoqing. As long as he could cover her with his own flesh and blood, everything would be worth it!

At that moment, a hand reached out from the bushes and firmly grasped the gilded mace.

*Hum!*

The gilded mace emitted a ringing sound of metal, drawing the attention of both Wan Miaoqing and the old monk.

The old monk let out a strange, cackling laugh, his movements not stopping as he said, "Youngster, a divine weapon has a spirit. To wield it, you must first make it acknowledge you. With your method, nine out of ten will die from the weapon's self-resonance and backlash. Even I wouldn't dare to say I could hold it. I knew it, human greed is truly endless. I knew you were lurking nearby all for this gilded mace."

Wan Miaoqing's eyes, however, revealed a trace of unusual interest. She remained silent, watching intently.

Ignoring the old monk's mockery, Xu Yunfan's five fingers had just touched the icy cold grip of the gilded mace when the muscles on his forearm suddenly writhed and bulged. Bronze-colored blood vessels thumped wildly beneath his skin.

The shaft of the mace abruptly erupted with a humming sound of vibrating metal, cracking the skin on his tiger's mouth. Before the blood droplets could hit the ground, they were vaporized into red mist by the high temperature. The gilded mace actually began to resonate and tremble on its own, refusing to stop.

Xu Yunfan's five fingers suddenly tightened, the blood in his palm visibly darkening and turning purple. The arch in his waist and back reached the limit a human spine could bear, with continuous crisp sounds of bone joints grinding. Within the dome formed by his twelve pairs of ribs, a sound like galloping horses treading on clouds—the roar of blood—could be heard.

The surrounding grass and trees were pulverized by this vibration. The gilded mace in his hand let out a deep growl like an ancient behemoth grinding its teeth.

*Hum!*

As the weapon's fierce energy struggled against his body's ultimate strength, even a slight shake of the gilded mace sent visible ripples through the air, transforming into layers of gusting wind that caused the surrounding grass, trees, and earth to tremble incessantly.

The deltoid on Xu Yunfan's left shoulder suddenly bulged with vine-like blue blood vessels. The density of his muscle fibers surpassed the constraints of his fascia, forcibly reversing the angle of his wrist by fifteen degrees as he grabbed his own right wrist holding the mace.

Blood trickled from the corners of his mouth, and two thin lines of blood seeped from his ear canals—a manifestation of his capillaries exceeding their physiological limits.

Xu Yunfan's hand trembled slightly. He pushed the blood and qi within his body to its limit, his skin taking on a bronze hue at this moment. The twisting sound of his muscle fibers was like hundreds of tempered steel wires being pulled taut.

He couldn't suppress it!

The gilded mace was slowly awakening its own power. In that instant of awakening, he felt as if he had grabbed a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the midst of giving birth. The skin on his tiger's mouth cracked inch by inch, and the scorching blood was swallowed by the mace's handle the moment it seeped out.

A divine weapon has a spirit; it did not acknowledge him!

Suddenly, the arm holding the gilded mace shook violently. To an outsider, it looked as if Xu Yunfan had suddenly raised the gilded mace and then, with his arm muscles bulging, heavily struck his own chest.

*Thump!*

A formidable force struck his body, sending him tumbling through the air several times before he crashed to the ground.

*Huh?*

The expected, intense pain never came. Xu Yunfan, who quickly flipped over and got up, subconsciously touched the part of his chest that had been struck by the gilded mace.

It seemed that the Extreme Daoist's remains from the underground mine in Ninggu Tower had completely negated the mace's power. This fatal blow, which should have shattered his internal organs, was entirely absorbed by the Extreme Daoist's remains he had bound to his chest.

His spirit lifted slightly, and his five fingers gripped even tighter, refusing to let the gilded mace escape.

His thoughts raced. He released his left hand and formed the Seal of Lin with one hand.

"Lin!"

A voice like a Taoist chant rang out. The deity he had visualized upon entering the practice manifested its true form within his mind, instantly quelling his boiling emotions.

The agitation in the depths of Xu Yunfan's pupils vanished, replaced by a feeling of effortless control, of coming and going as he pleased.

At the same time, the deity visualized in his sea of consciousness appeared, mirroring his body's movement as it made a虚 grasp towards the gilded mace's handle.

In an instant, the gilded mace, which had been trembling and struggling incessantly, gave a mighty shudder. A gust of wind spread in all directions, and then it fell completely silent.

The violent aura on the gilded mace was quickly dissipated by this ethereal emotion, and the originally scorching handle rapidly became as warm and smooth as jade.

"What?!"

The old monk's two eyeballs nearly shot out of his fleshy sludge and onto Xu Yunfan, wanting to see what kind of monster this young man was to be able to subdue a divine weapon in such a short time. Since ancient times, only divine weapons have chosen their masters. Those who could subdue a divine weapon were all supreme Grandmasters of the Nine Realms of Martial Dao, who washed it with their true qi day and night.

Wan Miaoqing was also stunned for a moment. The scene before her had exceeded her knowledge. Her black hair was lifted by the spreading wind, revealing the fine beads of sweat on her pristine forehead.

How could human power reach such a state?

A scorching blood qi overflowed from Xu Yunfan's throat. The gilded mace trembled in his palm like a living creature. A spiderweb of blood patterns writhed beneath his skin, and every inch of his muscles let out a哀鸣 of imminent collapse. He could clearly feel his internal organs being kneaded repeatedly by some primordial force, trying to squeeze out the last bit of hidden power.

He, in the state of Lin, quickly realized that the gilded mace was squeezing his body's potential, intending to raise his strength to a level that matched it. If this continued, his lifespan would be shortened!

He could only maintain the Lin state for three breaths. If he exceeded that and continued to use it forcibly, his body would gradually begin to collapse. He hadn't even reached the Three-Forged Martial Master realm. To be able to subdue a divine weapon would be utterly unbelievable if word got out.

*First Breath.*

He turned sideways, and in a single stride, he shot forward like an arrow leaving its bow, instantly closing in on the two of them. At this moment, the blood qi rising rapidly within his body had swollen his muscles into lumps of flesh hanging on his body.

In mid-air, Xu Yunfan twisted his body and raised his shoulder. The gilded mace in his hand, like a meteor falling from the heavens, scraped the air into a blaze as it descended heavily upon the old monk.

The sight terrified the old monk, his soul fleeing in panic.

"Wait, wait! I have the secret method to ascend to immortality! I know of the great..."

Before he could finish, the gilded mace, trailing a wave of molten-like air, crashed down. The last thing the old monk's turbid eyes saw was the fierce, primitive fire rising from the mace's thundercloud patterns.

"—The Secret of Longevity!"

His final three words were mixed with shattered bone and minced flesh as they burst forth.

The ground cracked inch by inch, and smoke and dust, carrying sparks, shot up into the sky.

It was as if a subterranean dragon had turned over. The old monk's flesh and blood were instantly consumed by the blazing fire dragged out by the gilded mace. The next moment, a clearly visible burst of qi erupted, shattering his sludge-like flesh into a rain of blood that scattered away.

With this strike, the bulging muscles on Xu Yunfan's body finally receded by a large amount.

It was still not enough.

*Second Breath.*

As Xu Yunfan turned, the bones in his neck let out cracking sounds under the unbearable strain. His暴涨 muscles tore the night suit into a spiderweb of cracks.
