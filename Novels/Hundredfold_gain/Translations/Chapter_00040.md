# Chapter 40: Medicinal Bath Tempering, Twentyfold Critical Strike

In the quiet chamber of his cave abode, Qi Chuan sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, carefully studying the manual of the Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body technique. After finishing his first thorough reading, he slowly closed the booklet, his eyes revealing a trace of awe.

[You diligently read through the Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body technique, attempting to comprehend it. Triggering an eightfold critical strike, you gained eightfold rewards. Your understanding of the technique has slightly improved.]

Simultaneously, words appeared before his eyes, and new insights about the technique flooded his mind. Compared to his hasty reading in the valley earlier, this deeper comprehension from focused study gave Qi Chuan a more complete understanding of the Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body.

"This Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body is truly an exceptional body tempering technique," Qi Chuan murmured in admiration.

According to the manual, apart from lacking follow-up techniques and being limited to six levels, this technique was second to none during the first and second stages of body cultivation. It contained unique cultivation methods and various means to strengthen the body. When mastered completely, one's skin, bones, flesh, and even internal organs would become crystalline and jade-like, possessing power comparable to spiritual artifacts.

Among the various body-strengthening methods recorded, the most suitable for a beginner like Qi Chuan who had never practiced body cultivation was a medicinal bath technique. By adding various spiritual herbs and materials to the bath and employing the Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body cultivation method, one could absorb the medicinal properties to continuously strengthen the body, undergoing a complete transformation to reach the first stage of body cultivation—equivalent to a Qi Refining cultivator in power.

The manual also included several medicinal bath recipes where certain ingredients complemented each other, producing synergistic effects greater than the sum of their parts.

"If I can cultivate the Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body to the third level, reaching the peak of first-stage body cultivation, wouldn't my physical body alone be comparable to a top-grade magical artifact?" Qi Chuan mused, his eyes brightening. "With such a robust physique and vigorous qi and blood, it would greatly aid in breaking through to Foundation Establishment!"

After carefully rereading the manual several times to fully understand the technique, Qi Chuan realized that unlike other cultivation methods, comprehending this body tempering technique wasn't particularly difficult—the real challenge lay in the subsequent cultivation process.

"First, I'll go to the Alchemy Pavilion to purchase the required spiritual herbs and materials," Qi Chuan decided, focusing on one of the milder yet effective medicinal bath recipes in the manual.

Thus, Qi Chuan eagerly left his cave abode and headed northwest within the inner sect. The Alchemy Peak was located in the northwest region of the inner sect, and its Alchemy Pavilion not only exchanged various pills but also spiritual herbs and materials. Qi Chuan had visited before, primarily to exchange for Gathering Yuan Pills.

The Alchemy Pavilion bustled with inner sect disciples coming and going. After the Mission Hall, it was one of the most frequented places, as many disciples came to exchange their hard-earned contribution points for pills.

Arriving at the pavilion, Qi Chuan glanced at the plaque above the entrance before stepping inside. He went directly to the fourth floor, as the first three floors were for pill exchanges, while the fourth floor specialized in spiritual herbs and materials—a less crowded area since fewer disciples needed them.

At a counter on the fourth floor, Qi Chuan handed a list to an attendant. "Please prepare these herbs and materials for me," he requested. The list contained information about various herbs, though the types and quantities had been slightly altered to prevent anyone from deducing the complete medicinal bath recipe.

"Are you learning alchemy?" the attendant asked, scanning the list with surprise.

"No," Qi Chuan replied with a faint smile.

"Alchemy requires significant investment and consumes considerable energy. As a young inner sect disciple, you shouldn't delve too deeply into it. Focus on your cultivation first," the attendant advised, clearly misunderstanding Qi Chuan's intentions. Without waiting for further explanation, he went to gather the requested items.

Soon, the attendant returned with a large package of herbs. "Five contribution points," he said cheerfully.

"That much?" Qi Chuan winced as he accepted the package. Five inner sect contribution points equated to fifty low-grade spirit stones. Body cultivation was clearly a resource-intensive path, unsuitable for those without substantial means. He wondered how long this single package would last.

Despite the sting, Qi Chuan paid the contribution points without hesitation and left the pavilion with his precious package.

Some time later, in Qi Chuan's upper-tier first-grade cave abode...

Gurgle...

In a stone chamber, a large stone vat stood filled with boiling, dark-red medicinal liquid. Various herbs floated in the viscous solution, filling the room with a rich, herbal aroma.

Qi Chuan had found the stone vat in a corner of his abode. After cleaning it several times with conjured water, he added the herbs and filled it again with water, using his magic power to boil it continuously for hours until it thickened into this potent medicinal bath.

Gazing at the steaming liquid, Qi Chuan hesitated briefly before steeling himself and stepping into the vat. He sat cross-legged, submerging everything but his head.

"Hiss..."

The moment his skin touched the scalding liquid, intense heat surged through his body, making him grit his teeth in pain. The sensation worsened as he settled into position. For a moment, he considered activating his Golden Skin Technique to resist the heat but stopped himself—doing so would block the medicinal properties from being absorbed.

Despite the agony, Qi Chuan's skin and body remained unharmed, not even showing signs of being cooked. Gradually, the pain dulled into numbness. This resilience came from his years as a fourth-level Qi Refining cultivator; his body had already been strengthened by continuous tempering with spiritual energy, making him resistant to such temperatures.

"Time to begin cultivation," Qi Chuan thought, calming his mind. He then activated the unique cultivation method of the Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body. As a body tempering technique, it required spiritual roots to practice—a condition Qi Chuan met, possessing both spiritual roots and magic power.

Trickle...

As the technique circulated, Qi Chuan felt strands of medicinal energy seeping through his pores from the viscous liquid, continuously strengthening his body.

[You activate the Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body in the medicinal bath, absorbing medicinal energy to temper your physique. Triggering a twentyfold critical strike, you gain twentyfold rewards. Your body has been slightly strengthened.]

Moments later, familiar words appeared in Qi Chuan's vision.
