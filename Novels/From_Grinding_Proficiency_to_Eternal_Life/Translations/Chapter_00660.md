# Chapter 660: The Sword Dao True Lord, Han Shi

The phantom of the Great Sun Vairochana Dao Fruit trembled violently, on the verge of shattering, yet it was forcibly held together by the wishing power flowing down from the Bodhi Sacred Tree.

At the epicenter of the explosion, space completely collapsed into a black hole.

Dark golden blood-red lightning writhed frantically within it like a dying giant serpent. Fragments of the Vajra Pestle, carrying the True Martial Subduing Evil Aura, tore the void for a hundred miles into chaos.

The phantom of the Ground Buddhist Kingdom emerging from the Eastern Wasteland, like an ancient painting splashed with boiling water, twisted and dissolved in the turbulent energy currents.

The heavens suddenly poured down thick, viscous blood rain, and the strong winds swept across the Eastern Wasteland with the wails of ghosts and deities.

The Thousand-Handed Phantasm of Bodhisattva Huiri disintegrated inch by inch. Cracks like spiderwebs burst open on the surface of his Vairochana Golden Body, and淡 golden Buddha blood gushed wildly from his seven orifices.

He stumbled back three steps. The lotus platform beneath his feet shattered, and the phantom of the Great Sun Vairochana Dao Fruit behind him trembled violently but ultimately did not dissipate.

"Cough, cough..."

Huiri wiped the golden blood from the corner of his mouth. Where his kasaya was scorched, the luster of his Vairochana treasure physique was revealed.

A Golden Core True Lord had brazenly self-detonated. The terrifying power shook the entire world, leaving everyone in the heavens and earth stunned.

Or rather, no one had reacted yet. He had just achieved the Golden Core realm and immediately resorted to self-detonation.

Even in novels, such a plot would be considered too exaggerated!

Especially the Hidden Source True Lord lurking in the shadows. His face twitched uncontrollably. He could already imagine that if he had shown himself prematurely, he would have likely died on the spot.

"Xu Yunfan, you are truly ruthless. You didn't hesitate to abandon even a Golden Core level clone."

He had heard of the Cloud Sutra Clone Technique and naturally knew its effect was to exchange souls. Although this supreme scripture had never been successfully cultivated by anyone until now, Xu Yunfan had already demonstrated its不可思议 power at this moment.

He had even abandoned a Golden Core.

If it were him, how could he resist such a temptation?

For a moment, the True Lord Hidden Source's wariness of Xu Yunfan deepened.

As long as this man remained alive, he would not be able to eat or sleep in peace.

Although Bodhisattva Huiri looked miserable and his Small World was severely damaged, he was still alive.

He looked at Xu Yunfan in the canyon, his face ferocious, no longer bearing any trace of Buddhist nature.

"Beast! I cultivated the Great Sun Vairochana Treasure Body Dao Fruit, invulnerable to all laws! What is a Golden Core self-detonation to that?!"

Xu Yunfan was holding his Small World and ramming it toward the Divine Firmament Dao Fruit. His pupils constricted upon seeing this.

He saw the cracks on Huiri's Golden Body being rapidly repaired by the wishing power flowing down from the Bodhi Sacred Tree. Although his aura had plummeted, his foundation remained intact.

"I underestimated this bald donkey's turtle shell."

Xu Yunfan's mind raced. His gaze swept toward the Ten Thousand Swords Sect. There, the pitch-black pillar of light from the Cangming Dao Fruit had completely converged.

At the Ten Thousand Swords Sect, the pitch-black pillar of light from the Cangming Nine Abyss Dao Fruit suddenly retracted, all of it plunging into Han Shi's body.

A phantom formed by endless surging tides and a vortex of the Abyss flashed behind him. Instantly, a terrifying sword intent, as deep as an abyss and capable of devouring all things, shot up from Han Shi's body.

His aura instantly broke through the Foundation Establishment shackles, rising infinitely, pointing directly toward the Golden Core Great Dao.

The Cangming Abyss Dao Fruit was formed!

"It is done! Han Shi has proven the Cangming Fruit!"

An uproar erupted within the Ten Thousand Swords Sect, and many wore unsightly expressions.

A commoner had proven the Golden Core. Would another True Lord of Pure Yang emerge?

Han Shi slowly stood up, holding his sword. The pressure of a Golden Core swept across the Twelve Sword Peaks.

A new Sword Dao True Lord, not yet two hundred years old, advancing with great momentum, proving the Dao today—a rarity since ancient times.

Having proven the Sword Dao Golden Core, Han Shi's spirit showed a trace of struggle and despair, but it turned into a calm sea in an instant.

He bowed deeply toward the True Lord of Pure Yang from afar, then transformed into a sword light and flew swiftly toward the Eastern Wasteland.

Above the Eastern Wasteland, under Huiri's gaze, the thunder pillar of the Divine Firmament Jade Clear Nine Chambers Mystic Vault Myriad Transformation Immortal Dao Fruit also suddenly contracted.

Where Xu Yunfan's main body sat cross-legged, the lightning converged completely. A vast aura that could shatter all laws, bear all heavens, and be eternally immortal erupted like a dormant volcano.

The skin over his entire body flowed with purple-gold divine brilliance. In his Dantian, a phantom of a resplendent Golden Core, coiled by ninety-nine purple-gold divine dragons and containing the embryonic form of a world of endless thunder, slowly condensed and manifested.

The Divine Firmament Dao Fruit had been successfully manifested.

Next, as long as he raised his Small World and rammed it in, it would be done. This would take but a breath.

"Never!!!"

Bodhisattva Huiri's eyes were about to split from fury. The power of the Vairochana King Buddha Fruit surged wildly. Ignoring the backlash from the ritual, he condensed another, even more solid golden Buddha palm, which, carrying the might of a collapsing sky, slammed fiercely toward Xu Yunfan's location.

He absolutely could not allow the Primordial Origin Sect to add another True Lord.

"Bodhisattva," Xu Yunfan suddenly spoke. The thunderlight descending from the Divine Firmament Dao Fruit was already absorbing his Small World Dao Foundation.

"It seems you have suffered consecutive failures. The Buddhist Kingdom has become a mere illusion, the King Buddha has turned into a battle-fighting figure, and now you can't even kill me."

Huiri suddenly turned his head and happened to see a sword light transform into a rainbow crossing the sky, heading straight for him.

"Ten Thousand Swords Sect?!"

Huiri's expression shook. A Sword Cultivator—their command of killing arts was not to be underestimated.

Huiri turned his head sharply. His pupils reflected a pitch-black sword rainbow tearing through the sky.

Before the sword light arrived, the abyss-devouring sword intent had already caused the golden leaves of the Bodhi Sacred Tree to fall in a frenzy.

"The new Sword Dao True Lord from the Ten Thousand Swords Sect. Is he also one of them?!"

Huiri's heart trembled violently.

Sword Cultivators' killing prowess was supreme among the Three Sects. If he were at his peak, a mid-stage Golden Core, it would be a different story, but a mere Sword Dao True Lord who had just entered the Golden Core realm was still manageable.

However, his body was now severely injured by Kongwu's self-detonation, and he did not dare to be arrogant.

The Buddha palm turned halfway, and a琉璃 Buddha Wall was erected in front of him,硬接 this life-forcing strike from the Cangming True Lord.

"Clang!"

The moment the sword rainbow struck the Buddha Wall, a vortex of the Abyss bloomed at the sword's tip.

Cracks spread across the琉璃 Buddha Wall. Huiri stumbled back, and three petals of the golden lotus beneath his feet shattered.

He looked up and saw the figure revealed within the sword light. Han Shi's face was cold and indifferent. The phantom of the Heavenly Chariot Sword Throne floated behind him, and the sword tip pointed directly at Huiri's眉心.

"A commoner dares to call himself a True Lord?!"

Huiri roared in anger, forcibly forming the Thousand-Handed Phantasm.

The Great Sun Vairochana Dao Fruit frantically drew upon the essence of the Bodhi Sacred Tree, and the cracks on his Golden Body healed at a visible speed.

"Today, I shall let you know the difference between cloud and mud!"

The clone Han Shi remained silent, controlled by Xu Yunfan, too lazy to waste words.

The Cangming Sword Domain erupted with a bang, turning a hundred miles of the world into a raging abyss.

The Heavenly Chariot Sword Throne suppressed the void. Nine abyss-devouring sword dragons emerged from the vortex, sealing all of Huiri's escape routes.

This strike contained the Divine Firmament Dao Charm of Xu Yunfan's main body, which shatters all laws, and also carried the surging resentment and anger Han Shi had accumulated for a hundred years.

The furious killing intent had already climbed to an unprecedentedly terrifying level.

After all, being manipulated by Xu Yunfan to act as a cannon fodder, Han Shi's resentment was as high as the heavens.

"Ten Thousand Chariots Extinction · Abyss Calamity!"

The sword fell like an abyss倾倒.

Huiri roared and formed the final Buddhist seal. The phantom of the Bodhi Sacred Tree and the remaining wishing power of the Buddhist Kingdom were all burned.

The琉璃 Buddha light transformed into a solid golden wall. On the wall surface, the phantoms of a million Bhikkhus chanting sutras appeared.

This was the Bodhisattva's final desperate technique.

The Prajna Sumeru Barrier.

The moment the sword dragon struck the golden wall, the Taihua Spirit Ruin World seemed to freeze for an instant.

The pitch-black vortex of the Abyss and the琉璃 Buddha light frantically annihilated each other.

The Heavenly Chariot Sword Throne emitted a cracking sound as if it could no longer bear the strain. Sword light shot from Han Shi's seven orifices, and the Golden Core Dao patterns flickered, on the verge of extinguishing.
