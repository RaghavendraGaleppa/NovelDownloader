# Chapter 122: The Curtain Falls

Li Qingyue wasn't worried about Qin Ming's safety, as she had already severely wounded her fellow disciple and former close friend, who was now her competitor.

Wang Caiwei was severely injured. Her black-gold armor was shattered, and her face was as pale as paper. She, who usually loved to smile, was in an extremely poor state, with sorrow clouding her eyes and brows. The golden body-protecting garment, specifically made by the Outer Realm to protect its disciples, which she wore underneath, had completely dimmed. It had been pierced through before and was already stained red with blood. In the past, her figure was graceful and lithe when she walked. Today, she arrived in a hurry, clad in her damaged black-gold armor. Though her feet glowed and she moved swiftly, something was clearly wrong, especially as she stumbled slightly upon approaching.

Qin Ming remained exceptionally calm. He held the Bagua Furnace, steaming with immortal mist, using it as a weapon, while his other hand was densely imbued with Heavenly Light Energy capable of incinerating spiritual consciousness. Although he wasn't very familiar with Wang Caiwei, he held no ill will towards her. Thinking back, when they traveled together, she had been delicate-minded and loved to smile, making their time together quite pleasant. However, that one private outing had happened over two years ago, and the memories and details had long since faded. Deep down, Qin Ming hoped they could simply mind their own business; that would be for the best. But if she came to seize the Near-Immortal Object, he would have no choice but to act.

Wang Caiwei, unsteady on her feet, suddenly halted nearby. She didn't attack. After losing too much blood, her beautiful but pale face was devoid of its usual smile, giving her a sense of tragic beauty. She gazed at Qin Ming, then secretly transmitted a message: "Is that you? From Scarlet Cloud City."

Qin Ming's expression remained calm, but his heart jolted in surprise. She had investigated him, knew part of his current situation, and now recognized him—how was that possible?! He was currently wearing armor and a golden mask, and his facial features had been altered by Meng Xinghai using esoteric sect methods.

"What are you talking about?" Qin Ming's right hand slightly lifted. The three great wondrous arts, combined with eighteen types of Heavenly Light Energy, resonated and fused into one, becoming incredibly terrifying. To many Outer Realm disciples, it felt like a blazing sun incinerating everything.

"I know it's you who returned. Please help me this one time. As long as my strength improves fast enough, the Wang family won't be willing to marry me off. I need the Near-Immortal Object; I don't want to become a sacrifice in a political marriage." Wang Caiwei's face was snow-white, looking desolate and helpless. She looked at the tall, slender figure in front, completely covered by golden armor, and said, "I know it's you. I have an eidetic memory. Some of your habitual movements and details, the Wang family had shown me your information even before I knew you, so I'm already well-acquainted with them."

Qin Ming shook his head. "I don't know what you're talking about. The Near-Immortal Object already has a master." He was already prepared for a major battle. His left hand tightly clutched the Bagua Furnace, which flowed with an auspicious glow, while the Heavenly Light Energy condensed in his right hand seemed to transform into a brilliant small sun.

"As old friends, you're wholeheartedly helping Li Qingyue, yet your guard against me is so heavy. And I truly have no ill will towards you... How much do you really know about Li Qingyue?" Wang Caiwei transmitted, sighing.

Qin Ming frowned and said, "If you want the Near-Immortal Object, exchange it for Sky-Pillar Force, Tathagata Force, Jade-Purity Force, or bring three stacks of wondrous arts."

"Li Qingyue wants to become Near-Immortal. Once she obtains the Bagua Furnace, she will no longer step into the mortal world. After parting today, it will be difficult for you to meet again. In the future, she will either lead the Outer Realm to ultimate glory, transforming all Blessed Lands into Grotto-Heavens and traversing the void, or she will lead the people of the Outer Realm to their deaths deep within the night-mist world of the Great Genesis Era, their path blocked and cut off. What she thinks is different from us. You don't understand her. Once she obtains the Near-Immortal Object, she will certainly sever all worldly ties, destined to become an exceptionally pure practitioner on the path to immortality."

Qin Ming frowned, pulling a distance away from her, still on his guard.

"I am actually more similar to you; we are both struggling to change our own destinies. Help me this one time. If I put on a truly astonishing performance, I can make my family change their minds, and afterward, I can give the Near-Immortal Object to Li Qingyue. I swear upon an Outer Realm forbidden art!" Wang Caiwei's eyes were red-rimmed, looking utterly helpless and desolate.

Qin Ming had already experienced quite a bit. Many words, he simply listened to, but the most crucial thing was to observe the other party's true actions. Sometimes, if he couldn't make a judgment, he would only acknowledge one principle: judge by actions, not intentions. He did not approach the other party to attempt any spiritual resonance, always maintaining his distance. The core disciples' cultivation was higher than his, so there was no need to take risks.

"You've said so much, but I don't understand." Qin Ming quickly pondered whether, if the other party recognized him, it would lead to severe consequences and terrible dangers once they left the Luofu Immortal Mountain Ruins.

Wang Caiwei sighed softly, "You think I love to smile and therefore believe I'm hypocritical? Alas, in truth, most people who love to smile are just covering up their not-so-bright moods. I actually really want to cry; my own destiny is not in my hands." She walked two steps forward, wanting to approach. The Bagua Furnace in Qin Ming's hand buzzed and hummed under the impact of his Heavenly Light Energy, ready to strike at any moment.

Wang Caiwei sighed lightly. With a whoosh, she surprisingly retreated rapidly, choosing to leave the Luofu Immortal Mountain Ruins without attacking him.

Qin Ming looked at her retreating back and said, "Whether you're acting, or genuinely feeling helpless about your destiny, I wish you well." He was no longer Cui Chonghe. Those he hadn't interacted deeply with in the past had gradually become mere symbols of his bygone days.

Qin Ming noticed that the clear-out battle in the distance was already nearing its end. Jiang Shengyu, Su Jingshu, Hu Tingwen, and the others knew this was Li Qingyue's battle to establish her authority. In front of so many elite disciples, she likely wouldn't kill them, so they unleashed their strongest few techniques. Alas, no matter how much they exerted themselves, they couldn't harm Li Qingyue in the slightest. Several individuals were all severely wounded, sent flying, covered in bloodstains, and had already fallen to the ground, unable to get up.

Without a doubt, this clear-out battle deeply shook all the Outer Realm disciples who witnessed it. The gap between them and the core disciples was quite significant. The golden armor on Li Qingyue's body clanged, piece by piece flying off as she disrobed, taking off her helmet, fully revealing her true appearance. At this moment, she wore her earliest damaged armor, stained with her own blood, proving that she had earlier undergone an incredibly brutal and perilous battle, having been surrounded and attacked, yet surviving.

Li Qingyue's black hair fluttered, her figure tall and slender. Her skin was like congealed fat, her face exquisite and flawless. Her entire being was enveloped in a faint glow, surrounded by a light white mist. Her damaged, blood-stained armor added a touch of heroic spirit to her ethereal and transcendent immortal demeanor. She pressed towards Tang Xumi and Li Qingxu; only the two of them still had the strength to fight.

"I'm convinced, I surrender!" Tang Xumi shouted readily, no longer wanting to attempt his strongest attack. Then, with a thud, he fell flat on his back, breathing heavily, covered in blood. He let out a few laughs, a mixture of bitterness and liberation.

Li Qingxu hesitated: should he surrender now, or pay a greater price and fight one more battle? Li Qingyue was already close, giving him no chance to choose, nor allowing him to say anything more, and directly attacked him. In an instant, the ground cracked open, creating an immense commotion. Sacred light rained down brilliantly, and massive boulders continuously broke off from the edge of the deep pit.

Li Qingxu erupted regardless of the cost, but still lost. Covered in blood, he collapsed into a pile of rubble, completely exhausted. Moreover, the treasure his master had forged for him, that purple bamboo staff that had borne Heavenly Light and remained undamaged, had already fallen into Li Qingyue's hands.

Li Qingyue held the purple bamboo staff, looking at Li Qingxu, and said, "Before entering the immortal mountain ruins, I once said that the person you acted against back then was an old acquaintance of mine. More than two years have passed, and I want to do something for him."

With a bang, Li Qingyue swung the purple bamboo staff, striking one of Li Qingxu's arms. With a crunch, a crisp sound of bone cracking echoed. Everyone's hearts trembled. Li Qingyue was truly daring; even after the duel ended, she hadn't stopped, striking heavily against that old senior's favored disciple! A purple bamboo shadow streaked across the void and fell again, smashing Li Qingxu's left leg. The crunching sound was clearly audible.

At this moment, even the other core disciples were alarmed. Then they understood: no matter how fierce the struggle between juniors, that old senior wouldn't feel comfortable stepping in. Moreover, in the Outer Realm Pure Land, there were still some great figures who could keep that domineering and protective old senior in check, and they would absolutely not allow him to act recklessly. Today, Li Qingyue swept aside all core disciples, winning cleanly and beautifully. This was destined to attract the attention of those great figures; the person holding the Bagua Furnace would be specially cultivated and protected. Moreover, the great figures of various sects also held a dislike for Li Qingxu's master. Li Qingyue daring to strike his disciple probably aligned perfectly with the intentions of the various orthodoxies.

"What is establishing authority? There's no better choice than beating Li Qingxu. The prestige established is certainly enough!" Tang Xumi secretly sighed. Immediately, he quickly retreated backward, afraid that he too would get beaten.

"Whether it's rationality or selfish motives, I wanted to do this; I've wanted to beat you for a long time!" Li Qingyue said, having struck Li Qingxu a total of six times with the staff. Three of those strikes broke both his arms and one leg. The other three strikes weren't heavy; Li Qingyue merely let the staff fall lightly, slightly cracking his skull.

"My old acquaintance once suffered amnesia for over two years. Your current injuries are much lighter than his." Li Qingyue withdrew her hand and threw the bamboo staff out. It pinned into the ground in front of Li Qingxu like a long spear, flowing with a hazy purple glow.

Li Qingxu felt immense hatred, experiencing endless humiliation. Under the watchful eyes of all, he was actually brutally beaten with his own divine bamboo, losing all face. He had earlier wanted to employ a mysterious escape art to flee immediately, but it failed, forcibly interrupted by the other party, leaving him to experience his darkest moment!

"If no one else challenges me, then the contest for the Near-Immortal Object shall now come to an end." Li Qingyue spoke. Her black hair flowed like a waterfall, and her figure was as slender and graceful as an immortal willow. She surveyed her surroundings with cold beauty. When she nodded to her fellow disciples, she revealed a smile, like clouds and mist breaking apart, her entire being clear and transcendent, as if she were about to ascend to immortality.

Qin Ming sighed, thinking that perhaps after this parting, he wouldn't see her for a very long time. He was about to return to the relatively remote Scarlet Cloud City. Thousand-year-old aristocratic families, Blessed Lands, and the splendid Outer Realm Pure Land were all very far from him. He needed to advance step by step.
