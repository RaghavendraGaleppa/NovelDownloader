# Chapter 10: As the saying goes, Heaven Rewards Diligence

When the Seven Mysteries Sect disciples clashed with the fierce, bloodthirsty, and tenacious bandits of the Savage Wolf Gang, they were repeatedly at a disadvantage. The hundreds of disciples on this training expedition had spent over two years almost entirely within the Seven Mysteries Sect, and their usual sparring matches were always light. They were all youths who had never seen blood, and their martial arts skills would be greatly diminished in real combat.

"They don't take this training seriously at all. If they really encounter Savage Wolf Gang disciples, they'll suffer heavy losses," Han Zhen thought. "The inner sect disciples in the other two carriages are probably the same." He sighed inwardly. It was truly difficult for him to lead this group against the Savage Wolf Gang. Although Han Zhen sensed that there were masters secretly following and protecting them, he wasn't sure if they were just monitoring or if they would intervene in time. While Han Zhen didn't have much affection for most people in the Seven Mysteries Sect, he couldn't bear to see these children die in front of him. He made up his mind that when they encountered Savage Wolf Gang disciples, he would try his best to dissuade them from recklessly seeking glory. If he couldn't dissuade them, he could only let nature take its course.

Two days later, the journey was uneventful, and the carriages safely entered Guwei Town. It was a town much larger than Qingniu Town, with two intersecting main roads running through its center. The Seven Mysteries Sect had many properties in the town, most of which were managed by outer sect disciples like Uncle Han San. The Seven Mysteries Sect and the town's constables jointly maintained order. Recently, the Savage Wolf Gang members emerging from the mountains had caused a headache for the outer sect disciples stationed there.

The carriages stopped at Yingke Inn in Guwei Town, which was significantly larger than Chunxiang Restaurant, where Han Zhen had stayed for six years. Han Zhen and his group arrived in the evening. The inn was already packed, but fortunately, the innkeeper had been notified in advance. The largest private room had been reserved in advance, spacious enough for the important figures from the Seven Mysteries Sect to dine and rest. Undoubtedly, Han Zhen and his group were the ones being awaited. Although they were just thirteen or fourteen-year-old youths, no one in the town dared to slight or look down on them. In a few more years, several of these children would at least become Protectors or even Hall Masters, and the outer sect disciples managing the properties wouldn't have enough time to curry favor with them.

In the most luxurious private room on the top floor of Yingke Inn, after finishing their meal, only Han Zhen and the other Disciples of the Seven Absolutes Hall remained. Disciples of the Hundred Forging Hall, like Li Feiyu, were not qualified to see the operational orders for this mission; they only needed to gather on time tomorrow and follow the lead. Han Zhen spread out the map and the plan. To his surprise, various markings had already been made on the map. Both the retreat routes and the possible ambush locations of the Savage Wolf Gang were clearly marked.

Originally, Han Zhen had planned to gather ideas and formulate a battle plan. The sect had actually considered the weaknesses of Han Zhen and his group, even marking the villages the Savage Wolf Gang might attack and the estimated dates in the plan, saving them the time of haphazard analysis. After exchanging glances, Han Zhen simply said, "Free movement," and returned to his room. To Han Zhen's relief, Zhang Xiuer never came to bother him again.

The town wasn't particularly large, nor was it a magnificent ancient city, so Han Zhen naturally had no interest in sightseeing. The other disciples were different; they had been cooped up in the mountains for two years, practicing martial arts daily, almost to the point of bursting. Now they had spare money and status in the town, so taking advantage of the absence of sect elders overseeing them tonight, they enjoyed themselves immensely. However, despite their fun, these individuals still had a sense of propriety, remembering Senior Brother Han's strict prohibition against drinking.

Wu Yan, on the other hand, quietly led two familiar inner sect disciples away from the sight of others, then knocked on a back door and, accompanied by a few giggles, slipped inside. In the room with red lanterns and pink curtains, Wu Yan's mind was filled with Zhang Xiuer's face, making whatever fun he tried unsatisfying.

Little did they know that in the very inn where they were staying, Hall Master Yue and two Protectors had observed everyone's performance throughout the journey. Han Zhen had not slackened at all throughout the journey, treating this training expedition with caution and seriousness. He could maintain his original intent even when facing the temptations of the outside world, and seeing Wu Yan debasing himself in such a way, the three couldn't help but sigh. Not only did losing his vital essence cripple his martial arts future, but expending his energy in such a place right before a major battle was practically gambling with his life. Unfortunately, this child was favored by Deputy Sect Master Ma. Even if he knew Wu Yan had broken his purity, he would probably only scold him a few words and use precious medicine to replenish him.

"No wonder Sect Master Wu values Han Zhen, his personal disciple, so much!" one of the accompanying Protectors joked. "As the saying goes, Heaven rewards diligence. If I had his drive back then, I might be a Hall Master now."

"With your talent, you never even beat me once in the Seven Absolutes Hall back then! What are you dreaming of?" Hall Master Yue retorted without hesitation. Among those in the Seven Mysteries Sect who lived to their age, most had a bond forged through life-and-death situations.

"The past is the past, the present is the present. Old Yue, why don't you compare yourself to me when I was born?"

"Heh heh, when we go back, we'll have a spar. If I lose, I'll give you my Hall Master position!"

The next morning, under the cover of thick fog, Han Zhen led everyone in a forced march towards the predetermined location. Soon, everyone knew the ambush location for the Savage Wolf Gang.

"The Small River Gully is the only path out of Guwei Mountain; it's practically a choke point. If just a few people guard the rear, they can safely retreat back to Baimang Mountain," Han Zhen explained as he assigned tasks. "Therefore, we must restrict the Savage Wolf Gang's mobility. The ambush must be set in the woods that are a necessary passage from the Small River Gully to Liujia Village. Even if they have cavalry there, they won't be able to charge effectively."

In groups of two, they would take turns every two hours to go five li ahead as scouts, while the others rested and conserved their energy at the ambush point. From morning until evening, disciples who had rotated several times rushed back with news. They had found traces of Savage Wolf Gang disciples, numbering over thirty in total, led by a blue-clad enforcer with several cavalrymen, while the rest were green-clad disciples on foot. It seemed it wasn't easy for horses to cross several mountains, otherwise, a small cavalry unit's mobile harassment would be truly difficult to deal with.

A quarter of an hour later, at Han Zhen's signal, everyone was ready, lying in ambush behind tree canopies and roadside rocks. Beside Han Zhen, another female disciple was responsible for raising the flag to relay commands. At this moment, the Savage Wolf Gang members were less than two hundred paces from the ambush point. Han Zhen had previously handled powerful crossbows. Although this was already an effective killing range, Han Zhen did not issue the firing command. It wasn't until the sound of hooves was fifty paces away that five successive "thwack" sounds rang out, and blood mist instantly erupted from the leading blue-clad disciple. Several horses, struck by crossbow bolts, thrashed in pain, instantly throwing the Savage Wolf Gang's formation into disarray. The anticipated fierce battle did not occur. After the death of the leading blue-clad disciple, the green-clad gang members scattered and fled, completely lacking the so-called ferocity of the Savage Wolf Gang. Li Feiyu was overjoyed at this sight. Now was the time to kill a few more and earn merit, what were they waiting for?
