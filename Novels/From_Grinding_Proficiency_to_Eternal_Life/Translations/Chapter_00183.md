# Chapter 183: A Surge in Proficiency

The尖牙 (sharp teeth) scraped against the bronze cage bars, sparking against the metal.

Xu Yunfan’s pupils contracted as he saw clearly that those dense rows of teeth were not bone, but棱晶 (prismatic crystals) hardened from countless tiny ginseng roots.

Three ginseng-leaf-shaped birthmarks on the娃娃’s (doll’s) forehead suddenly glowed with a faint green light. The wounds pierced by the copper锥 (pegs) began to exude a milky white sap at a speed visible to the naked eye.

An indescribable exotic fragrance grew increasingly intense. With the doll’s action, the scent suddenly became three times stronger.

The knuckles of Xu Yunfan’s hands suddenly cracked like popping beans.

The exotic fragrance that钻入 (drilled into) his nasal cavity turned into scorching magma at his throat, rapidly dispersing into his flesh and blood through his lungs.

The Pure Yang internal energy that had been lying dormant within his flesh and blood, like firewood doused in gasoline,轰然爆开 (exploded with a bang), surging wildly through his skin, flesh, and membranes.

“Hiss!!”

Xu Yunfan didn’t have time to look at the several information prompts floating in his vision.

He stumbled and leaned against the岩壁 (rock wall), leaving five-finger indentations branded into the calcite he touched.

He could clearly feel that after inhaling that mouthful of exotic fragrance, a liquid like molten gold was flowing beneath his skin. Only then did he realize that the milky white sap seeping from the ginseng doll’s wounds was actually condensing into a mist-like spiritual marrow in the air!

What a waste! Such a waste!

Just smelling the aura of the other party had caused such a huge reaction in him. No wonder the demon tiger was desperate to take it back.

The bronze cage suddenly shook violently.

The doll was spread out, limbs splayed, against the bottom of the cage. Those sharp teeth chattered as they bit down, looking at Xu Yunfan’s expression of enjoyment with a hateful look. Puffing out its cheeks, it was clearly holding its breath, seemingly unwilling to let Xu Yunfan smell a single trace of its aura anymore.

Blood suddenly exploded from beneath Xu Yunfan’s skin.

He wiped the blood away with the back of his hand, only to find that the flesh and blood through which the subcutaneous liquid flowed seemed to be turning transparent, and the bones beneath the skin were glowing with a jade-like luster.

In just a few breaths, the flesh and blood that had almost turned transparent gradually returned to normal.

“What a tyrannical ‘Famao Suixi’ (cleansing of marrow and washing of tendons)!”

He tore open the leather armor on his left arm and saw that the blue-purple meridians were重组 (reorganizing) beneath the skin. Impurities within his body were constantly being expelled from the depths of his pores, covering his entire body in a layer of black oil!

Only then did he have the time to see the series of prompt messages that had popped up on his attribute panel, almost刷屏 (刷屏 - flooding the screen).

‘You inhaled a mouthful of pure spiritual marrow. Your physique has been enhanced.’

‘You inhaled a mouthful of pure spiritual marrow. The dormant Chaoyang Yiqi Gong within your flesh and blood moved spontaneously, constantly absorbing it. The proficiency of Chaoyang Yiqi Gong has increased significantly.’

Just this one prompt increased the proficiency of Chaoyang Yiqi Gong by twenty points. If he continued at this pace, it wouldn’t be two months before he achieved great success in Pure Yang Yiqi Gong and stepped into the Refining Flesh Realm.

This ginseng doll, even in an era where Yuan Spirit was flourishing and extreme powerhouses emerged, would absolutely be a divine medicine fought over until heads were broken and blood flowed.

A ginseng doll transformed from a ten-thousand-year ginseng is truly rare in the world!

Xu Yunfan’s heart surged with emotion. His eyes were fixed intently on the ginseng doll that was puffing out its cheeks and holding its breath. That burning gaze seemed as if he wanted to swallow the doll whole.

The ginseng doll shivered all over, subconsciously pressing its body against the bronze cage, trying desperately to get away from Xu Yunfan.

It had seen this kind of gaze on the demon tiger before.

What a pity!

Xu Yunfan slowly sat down on the ground, feeling a bit of regret.

If he were to swallow it whole, not to mention whether he could actually eat it, the spiritual marrow contained in the ginseng doll alone would instantly blow him up.

Just that mouthful of breath from the doll earlier had stretched his skin and flesh to the point of cracking, almost unbearable. If it happened again, his body might just崩解 (disintegrate).

Xu Yunfan currently didn’t dare to go to Tiangong City. If the demon tiger caught the scent and followed him there, it would likely cause unnecessary trouble. Also, there was that group of people from Beimang Mountain. If they weren’t dealt with cleanly and news leaked out, he would also fall into an abyss of no return.

Moreover, he had to forge a treasure chest cage to hold the doll, binding it to his chest to feel at ease. Carrying it around in a birdcage was no different than a child holding a sword and running amok in the marketplace. If he encountered a master whose strength far exceeded his own, he would be done for.

Xu Yunfan quickly calmed down.

He tilted his head and looked at the underground暗河 (underground river). With his ability to find dragons and distinguish veins, he naturally knew that this underground river had tributaries leading to the outside world.

He carefully dipped the ginseng doll in the water. Aside from making the doll angry and cry out loud, there was no sign of it trying to escape.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. He carried the Thunderfire麒麟 Hammer on his back, stabilized the玄钢机匣 (mystery steel mechanism box), and, ensuring there were no flaws, walked slowly to the riverbank.

The ginseng doll beside him, seeing Xu Yunfan’s movements, was first愣 (stunned), then began to cry out loud, its two small hands covered in ginseng roots grabbing the bronze cage and shaking it continuously.

Xu Yunfan ignored it. If they stayed here for a long time, that demon tiger would eventually find him. It was better to go out first and find a place to forge a mechanism box that could contain breath and hide mechanisms to put the ginseng doll in,这样才能 (only then could) avoid being tracked by the demon tiger.

He took the ginseng doll, which was squeaking and flailing its limbs, and plunged into the underground river.

A small半个时辰 (half an hour) later, the reeds by the pool rustled.

Xu Yunfan’s soaked back had just touched the green stones by the pool when his pupils reflected a bronze lamp three zhang away. The wick was unlit, but the lamp wall was covered in incantations that writhed like living things.

The Lamp Holder, dressed in gray cloth clothes, had his lapels damp with dew,显然 (evidently) having waited here for a long time.

“Xu Shaoye (Young Hero Xu) has excellent swimming skills.”

The Lamp Holder flicked a grass leaf off the lamp cover with a snap of his fingers. The copper lamp emitted the细响 (fine sound) of gears meshing as it turned, his finger constantly turning the oil nozzle on the bronze nail.

“From Ghost-Scaring Waterfall to Bibo Pool, there are seven forks in the underground river, yet you chose the most dangerous Serpent Coiling Path.”

Although the Lamp Holder’s words were light and airy, they couldn’t hide the dust and grass covering his body, evidently having encountered quite a bit of trouble on the mountain cliffs just now.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes twitched slightly upon hearing this, and he subconsciously looked at the ginseng doll in the bronze cage in his hand, which was spitting out water.

It was this little brat that, when the underground current surged up, suddenly shook and pulled him into the winding and rugged Serpent Coiling Path. If it hadn’t been for his good skills, his muscles, bones, and skin all being complete and perfect, and his internal organs having undergone a certain degree of tempering, he might have really died in that forked path.

Xu Yunfan’s five fingers tightened on the bronze cage, and pool water dripped down along the iron chain.

He squinted and looked at the Lamp Holder for a long time before slowly speaking.

“The Thousand-Mile Shared Dust Incense of Beimang Mountain?”

There were records in the Tiangong Cave. Those grave-robbing fellows from Beimang Mountain had many难以察觉 (hard to detect) methods on them.

The Thousand-Mile Shared Dust Incense was colorless and odorless, with extremely strong adhesion. It could only be smelled by those who had practiced the special secret martial arts of Beimang Mountain.

A flicker of surprise passed through the Lamp Holder’s gray eyes, and his gaze kept circling the ginseng doll in the bronze cage in Xu Yunfan’s hand.

“I underestimated you. I thought you were a young master who came out from Tiangong Cave to gather material, but I didn’t expect you to be someone who has walked the Jianghu.”

Xu Yunfan let out a light laugh, his gaze rapidly turning cold and sharp.
