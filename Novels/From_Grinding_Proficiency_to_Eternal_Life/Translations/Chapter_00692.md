# Chapter 692: Sometimes, Things Just Turn Out This Way

Zhang Ziyang’s aura had indeed surged to the peak of the Foundation Establishment perfection realm, even carrying a faint, elusive divine pressure. Clearly, with the aid of local incense and faith over the past decade, his progress had been astonishingly swift.

Xu Yunfan hesitated no longer. He took a single step and left the Divine Sovereign Mountain.

The space folded beneath his feet, allowing him to instantly pierce through the boundary wall of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World. In the blink of an eye, he appeared at the edge of the界海 (Boundary Sea) of the Aitira Great World.

The Thunder Manifestation phantom that had been lingering there all along instantly transformed from illusory to corporeal. A ten-thousand-zhang tall body of purple and gold towered between heaven and earth, its three heads and six arms radiating a majestic and awe-inspiring aura. The crown of thunder dragons coiling around its body became even more solid.

On his attribute panel, the value of 2000 in Dao Mastery transformed into a torrent of spiritual energy, released without reservation. It stirred the chaos of the Boundary Sea, causing the profound light of life and death to churn incessantly.

Almost in the same instant that Xu Yunfan’s Manifestation solidified, the center of the region of玄光晶石 (Profound Light Crystal) that had been permanently solidified not far away suddenly blazed with a brilliant platinum and琉璃 (lapis lazuli) light.

It seemed to have sensed Xu Yunfan’s movement.

The Manifestation of the Eternal True Lord of Myriad Eons’ Celestial Light also transitioned from illusory to corporeal. Its entire form was cast from pure lapis lazuli, and the Celestial Light Dao Seal on its forehead slowly rotated, emanating a timeless aura that could freeze space and time.

The condensed sword intent was held back, yet it had already firmly locked onto Xu Yunfan, filled with vigilance.

Xu Yunfan had revealed his true form at this moment, his aura surpassing that of ten years ago, forcing him to be on guard.

At the same time, he was secretly shocked. For a True Lord, ten years were but a snap of the fingers, a moment passed silently during a slight seclusion. He never expected that in just ten years without seeing him, Xu Yunfan’s Dao Mastery had advanced to such a terrifying extent.

He could not help but feel wary.

This man must be killed!

Xu Yunfan paid no heed to the vigilance of the Celestial Light True Lord. The Ice漠 (Desolate) Phase on his right arm pointed a finger into the void. The Star Spirit Banner rolled out from the void, swelling against the storm, and instantly transformed into a vast, sky-shrouding, profound star chart.

The 365 main stars on the banner suddenly lit up, corresponding to the origin projections of the celestial bodies throughout the heavens of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

“The celestial stars, heed my command! Bind this world!”

The main avatar in the center of Xu Yunfan’s Manifestation issued a command, its voice like a thunderclap from the nine heavens.

The Star Spirit Banner fluttered wildly. Led by the three Golden Core Banner Spirits, the 365 main stars on the banner flared with intense light. Each star projected a chain of starlight, refined to its very essence.

These chains were not physical entities but were formed from pure stellar laws fused with Xu Yunfan’s Divine Sovereign Destruction Dao Rhyme. Ignoring spatial distance, they instantly crossed the Boundary Sea and precisely钉入 (nailed into) the weak points of the Aitira World’s barrier.

*Sss!*

*Sss!*

*Sss!*

Countless chains of starlight, like living things, deeply pierced the scorched world barrier, emitting a grating tearing sound.

The entire Aitira Great World trembled violently, as if caught in a giant net woven from starlight. The lingering laws within the world, the shattered mountains and rivers, and the弥漫 (diffused) aura of dead silence and resentment all let out agonized groans under the束缚 (restraint) of the star chains, as if unable to bear the strain.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan hesitated no longer. His ten-thousand-zhang Manifestation spread all six arms, its muscles bulging and coiling, as if drawing an impossibly heavy giant bow. With supreme power, it sought to drag the entire Aitira Great World toward the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

“Xu Yunfan!”

The Celestial Light True Lord’s icy voice rang out, tinged with fury. The platinum and lapis lazuli Manifestation blazed even brighter, attempting to use the Celestial Light Dao Seal to solidify the chains of starlight.

“You are far too greedy! Myriad Chariot Sword Sect also has a share in the origin of this world. How dare you try to monopolize the merit? With such a gluttonous appetite, aren’t you afraid of choking to death?!”

He instantly understood Xu Yunfan’s intention. This was no simple struggle for resources; it was a clear attempt to dominate the entire sacrificial process of the Aitira World and seize the lion’s share of the heavenly merit for himself.

It was nothing short of a snake trying to swallow an elephant.

The怒相 (Furious Phase) on Xu Yunfan’s left arm let out a earth-shattering roar. The sound wave, carrying Thunder and True Solar Fire, blasted away the Celestial Light power that was trying to solidify the star chains.

“Celestial Light Daoist, stop your hypocrisy. The coordinates of this world were first obtained by this Sovereign and洞明 (Dongming). You lot are nothing but hyenas drawn by the scent of blood. You want a share of the merit? Fine!”

The Ice漠 (Desolate) Phase on his right arm swept its gaze over the Celestial Light True Lord, its voice returning to a calm tone. He knew in his heart that with the Celestial Light True Lord by his side, it would be impossible for him to pull the Aitira World alone.

In that case, he could just change his thinking. The Boundary Sea is endless, and worlds are born and die at every moment.

There are plenty of opportunities.

“This Sovereign alone pulling this world would suffer a great loss. If you wish to have a share, then lend a hand and pull it together. How about we divide the merit according to the effort we contribute?”

He paused, and the Star Spirit Banner gave a mighty shake, driving even more star chains into the world barrier, dragging the Aitira World another fraction closer to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

“With the mere scraps your subordinates have抢 (snatched) inside the world, is that even enough to fill the gaps between your teeth? Do you really want to sit by and watch this Sovereign get the great merit alone? Will the face of your Myriad Chariot Sword Sect still exist then?”

The Celestial Light True Lord’s Manifestation fell silent, the platinum and lapis lazuli light flickering不定 (unsteadily).

Xu Yunfan’s words had hit the nail on the head.

He couldn’t let Xu Yunfan monopolize it, but he wasn’t confident he could stop Xu Yunfan, whose momentum was currently like a raging torrent.

To stop him would come at a huge cost, and it might even allow the Bodhisattva Pure Land to reap the benefits.

To sit by and watch would mean witnessing Xu Yunfan obtain a massive amount of merit, cleanse the blacklisted label, and advance his cultivation another step further, all while the Myriad Chariot Sword Sect’s reputation would be dragged through the mud.

Weighing the pros and cons, cooperation seemed to be the only choice.

With such a great merit before them, it seemed all past grievances could be temporarily set aside.

Just as the Celestial Light True Lord was swayed, the light of his platinum and lapis lazuli Manifestation shifted, and a smile began to form on his face as he was about to respond…

“阿弥陀佛 (Amitabha)!”

A compassionate and grand Buddhist chant, as if rising from the depths of all living beings’ hearts, instantly pierced through the violent Boundary Sea.

Space rippled like water, and a巨大的 (giant) Eight-Treasure Lotus Throne appeared out of thin air.

Seated upon the throne was a Bodhisattva draped in a golden kasaya, with a compassionate and dignified expression, holding an Eight-Treasure Lapis Lazuli Pagoda in his hand.

It was none other than the Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva of the Bodhisattva Pure Land.

Boundless Buddhist light shone from his body, attempting to gently and柔 (softly) pacify the violent turbulence caused by the Star Spirit Banner’s chains piercing the Aitira World.

“True Lord of Divine Sovereign, please cease your actions!”

The Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva’s gaze was compassionate, his voice carrying a power that pierced the soul, directing his words straight to Xu Yunfan.

“Though the Aitira World is already shattered, there are still billions of living beings within it gasping their last breath. The immeasurable number of living beings in the minor chiliocosms that depend on this world for existence is beyond count. For the sake of personal merit, you engage in this act of uprooting and devouring a world, which is no different from severing the last glimmer of hope for these countless lives. How can such a monstrous act of killing be offset by merit? Quickly cease your actions and give the living beings of this world a path to life. My Buddha is compassionate, and we can still perform rites for their reincarnation and find them a peaceful Pure Land!”

The appearance of the Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva instantly made the situation even more subtle and complex.

The Bodhisattva Pure Land had finally ceased its onlooker stance, using the banner of saving all living beings as an excuse to intervene and claim a share, and might even be attempting to prevent the devouring to独占 (monopolize) the remaining faith and desire power of this world.

The central true form of Xu Yunfan’s Manifestation opened and closed its eyes. Purple and golden lightning pierced through the Buddhist light, landing on the Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva. The corner of Xu Yunfan’s mouth curled into an undisguised sneer.

“What a grand帽子 (hat) of ‘monstrous act of killing.’ This Sovereign would like to ask, when the celestial realm of this Aitira World collapsed, and the trillions of mortal lives along with the immeasurable minor chiliocosms attached to it turned to dust, where was your Buddhist compassion then?”
