# Chapter 2: Li Hu's Provocation, Solved with One Punch!

Su Yu, with his bank card, arrived at a street in Hengcheng.

Soon, Su Yu spotted a shop.

"Xingcheng Great Pharmacy!"

This pharmacy was quite famous throughout Hengcheng. It stocked elixirs for both cultivating vital energy (Qi and blood) and enhancing physical strength. There were even legendary Level 3 elixirs.

Su Yu took a deep breath and stepped into the Xingcheng Great Pharmacy. Immediately, a staff member came forward to greet him.

"Sir, what can I help you with? We just received a new batch of Level 1 Qi-Blood Elixirs, would you be interested?" The staff member said, a standard smile on her face.

Su Yu's heart stirred. "Let me see!"

The staff member rejoiced inwardly. A big customer! After all, most people who could afford Qi-Blood Elixirs were wealthy. Even if he only bought one, the commission alone would be equivalent to a day's wages for her. Naturally, the staff member welcomed such a customer.

"Please, sir, this way!" Saying this, she led Su Yu to a counter where over ten red Qi-Blood Elixirs lay quietly.

"These are freshly arrived Qi-Blood Elixirs. If you purchase ten or more at once, I can offer you a 10% discount!" Ten Qi-Blood Elixirs cost ten thousand yuan; with a 10% discount, it would be nine thousand.

Just then, Su Yu noticed a familiar face. However, he and I had never gotten along well. This guy, relying on his family's wealth, always bossed people around in class and generally wasn't well-liked. Su Yu never expected to run into this guy in such a place.

Su Yu's expression turned cold. "What does my being here have to do with you?"

Seeing Su Yu refuse to give him any face, Li Hu's expression immediately darkened. "Someone like you will never be able to set foot in a place like this in your entire life."

Li Hu turned to the staff member nearby and said sharply, "Package up all those Qi-Blood Elixirs for me! I'll take them all!"

The staff member's eyes lit up. All of them! Her commission would go up another level. Immediately, the staff member turned to Su Yu with an apologetic expression.

"I apologize, sir, but Mr. Li is a VIP of our pharmacy. Our medicines are prioritized for Mr. Li."

Su Yu's face instantly fell. "I was clearly here first! Why won't you sell to me?"

Li Hu looked at Su Yu mockingly. "I'll say this: if you can defeat me, all these items are yours!"

Su Yu said nothing. His legs bent slightly, and the next moment, he shot forward like a cannonball. His speed was so immense that Li Hu barely had time to react.

"How is this possible? How can this guy be so fast?" Li Hu immediately became wary, but alas, it was too late.

Just as Li Hu prepared to defend, Su Yu's body was already close, and he instantly unleashed a punch.

*Thud!*

The punch landed squarely on Li Hu's chest, sending him flying backward like a kite with a snapped string, crashing to the ground. One must know, after the enhancement from the Blood Refining Elixir, Su Yu's vital energy had already reached a considerable level, and his strength had reached four hundred kilograms. Such a punch, even a vital energy cultivator like Li Hu, could not easily withstand.

The next moment, the entire pharmacy fell silent.
