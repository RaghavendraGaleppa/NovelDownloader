# Chapter 55: Spectating

Li Shiming used his consciousness to enter the computer room space and took out a small amount of spiritual soil from his storage bag.  

He was familiar with the theoretical knowledge of spiritual soil, but he wanted to study the real thing carefully.  

A small amount of spiritual soil floated in the computer room space, suspended by his consciousness. However, he soon isolated the soil from the space using his consciousness.  

When he had previously sensed it with his spiritual energy outside, he hadn’t detected the presence of insect eggs in the soil.  

But now, under microscopic observation at the micron level, he discovered eggs that were nearly indistinguishable from the spiritual soil.  

He didn’t know if other cultivators could detect these eggs, but he had only found them within the computer room space.  

No wonder spiritual insects inexplicably appeared when planting spiritual plants with such soil.  

No matter what kind of formations or isolation methods were used, it was impossible to completely prevent spiritual insects from harming the plants—the soil itself was a significant source of the problem.  

Li Shiming carefully picked out all the eggs from the soil, ending up with a cluster the size of a fingernail.  

Though small, these eggs were incredibly tiny, and the cluster contained over ten thousand of them.  

He stored the eggs in a porcelain vial and returned the purified soil to his storage bag.  

From the IBM z15’s database, he found information on soilless cultivation of bamboo and prepared the corresponding nutrient solution.  

After cleaning and sterilizing the Rune Spirit Bamboo, he placed it in the nutrient solution and cast the *Spring Rain Technique*.  

Reviving the Rune Spirit Bamboo wasn’t difficult—bamboo was naturally resilient, and spiritual bamboo simply required a spiritual energy-rich environment.  

Currently, the computer room space had a steadily increasing concentration of spiritual energy, thanks to the Spirit Gathering Disk, which remained there most of the time except when he left to cultivate.  

For now, the space could support the growth of both the spiritual tea tree and the Rune Spirit Bamboo. However, he knew that once the bamboo recovered, it would start growing rapidly, and the space wouldn’t be able to meet its needs.  

In the afternoon, a message talisman in the form of a small bird arrived at Li Shiming’s window and landed on his desk.  

"Little friend Li, come at once!"  

The only person who would use a message talisman to contact him was Gu Jia.  

Gu Jia had left an address in the talisman. Without hesitation, Li Shiming set off immediately.  

This time, he traveled light, leaving his household behind and going alone.  

The address led him to an estate near the imperial palace, an area mostly inhabited by members of the royal family.  

"Little friend Li, you’re here. Take a seat—there are other cultivators arriving soon," Gu Jia said, gesturing to a nearby chair when he saw Li Shiming.  

"Has something happened?" Li Shiming asked as he sat down without ceremony.  

"The Hao family was wiped out last night. The other four families have sent people to inspect the scene and contacted me to discuss the matter. I called you here to broaden your experience," Gu Jia replied gravely.  

He was frustrated—his assignment as a guardian was supposed to be a retirement post, free of major troubles.  

But now, one incident after another kept occurring. The Hao family had been one of the most powerful cultivation families near the capital.  

Though such families were considered weak in the broader cultivation world, this region was far from the true heart of it, and the rogue cultivators here were mere fringe figures.  

The destruction of a cultivation family would have significant repercussions.  

Gu Jia had high hopes for Li Shiming and had invited him as a gesture of mentorship. Only by witnessing the ruthlessness of the cultivation world could one survive in it for long.  

Li Shiming subconsciously touched his head. He knew exactly how the Hao family had been destroyed.  

But what puzzled him was why the remaining four families hadn’t immediately moved to divide the spoils—especially the spiritual vein. He couldn’t believe they weren’t eager to claim it for themselves.  

Instead, they had come to Gu Jia. He couldn’t fathom their intentions.  

As he pondered this, four figures appeared at the entrance. Their legs shimmered with a faint green glow—evidence of the *Light Body Technique* they had used for swift travel.  

To enter the city quickly during the day, they had also employed the *Vanishing Step Technique*.  

"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Gu!" The four cultivators—the heads of the remaining families—bowed in unison.  

"You’ve arrived quickly," Gu Jia returned the greeting.  

The family heads wore solemn expressions and didn’t acknowledge Li Shiming in this formal setting.  

"Fellow Daoist Gu, all the Hao family’s cultivators were killed—including Elder Hao, who was at the sixth level of Qi Refining. This has left all of us rogue cultivators in fear. As representatives, we seek your permission to remain in the city for an extended period," the Liu family head said gravely.  

"Tell me about the scene at the Hao family. What has frightened you so much?" Gu Jia didn’t immediately agree. After a moment’s thought, he asked for details.  

Though rogue cultivators were allowed in the city, convention dictated they couldn’t stay long.  

The capital was a mortal world, and Gu Jia’s mission as a sect-appointed guardian was to ensure the safety of the mortals under the sect’s jurisdiction.  

Allowing rogue cultivators to linger would inevitably lead to trouble, and trouble would disrupt his peaceful life.  

"The attacker who targeted the Hao family was incredibly strong," the Liu family head said, his eyes flickering with fear. After steadying himself, he continued, "The Hao family’s defensive formation was active when it was forcibly breached. Judging from the bodies, their cultivators were killed instantly without even a chance to fight back."  

"Are you certain their formation was active when it was destroyed?" Gu Jia’s expression darkened as he pressed for confirmation.  

Though the Hao family wasn’t particularly wealthy, Gu Jia knew they had purchased their defensive formation from him at great cost.  

That formation, though limited in range, was strong enough to withstand attacks from a peak Qi Refining cultivator. Only a Foundation Establishment expert could have shattered it instantly.  

If a Foundation Establishment cultivator was involved, Gu Jia wouldn’t dare intervene lightly.  

The Heavenly Sea Sect was powerful, but in the capital, he was the only representative—a mere seventh-level Qi Refining cultivator. He had no authority to summon a Foundation Establishment expert from the sect.  

The only way the sect would send one was if he himself were killed here.  

"Based on the scene, that’s exactly what happened. We found the shattered formation disk—it wouldn’t have broken unless the formation was forcibly destroyed," the Liu family head affirmed.  

"And yet you still dared to guard the Hao family’s estate? Is that minor spiritual vein so valuable that you’d risk annihilation to contend with a Foundation Establishment cultivator for it?" Gu Jia demanded sharply.
