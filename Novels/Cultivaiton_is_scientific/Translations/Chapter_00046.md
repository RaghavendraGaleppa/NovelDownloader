# Chapter 46: The Gathering  

Tianshui Pavilion was the largest and most luxurious restaurant in Zhongdu, always filled with distinguished guests, especially during festivals when it became a gathering place for the nobility.  

The pavilion boasted exquisite decorations, with calligraphy and paintings by renowned artists adorning the walls, and rare curios displayed everywhere, dazzling the eyes.  

However, today was different. The head manager of Tianshui Pavilion stood outside the entrance, repeatedly bowing to arriving guests and offering apologies.  

Disappointed patrons, though frustrated—no one enjoyed being turned away on New Year's Day—knew better than to cause trouble. They were well aware of the powerful forces backing Tianshui Pavilion.  

What puzzled them most was who could possibly have the influence to reserve the entire pavilion. Even visiting princes usually only booked private rooms at most.  

"Mo Yan, you may return first," Li Shiming said as he stepped down from the carriage, instructing the servant who had lifted the curtain for him.  

He hadn’t noticed the commotion at the entrance. On a day like today, the entire city of Zhongdu was bustling, especially along this busy commercial street.  

"Young master, Tianshui Pavilion is closed to outside guests today," the head manager said with a bow as Li Shiming approached.  

Li Shiming paused. He had been told the gathering was on the third floor—why had the entire pavilion been reserved? Even without knowing much about Tianshui Pavilion, its grandeur was unmistakable.  

"I have an appointment on the third floor," he replied with a smile.  

"Young master, please come in," the manager said, his expression shifting to genuine warmth as he gestured inside. He then turned to a nearby attendant. "Escort the young master upstairs."  

The manager was worldly enough not to question Li Shiming’s claim. Though he didn’t know the identities of those gathering on the third floor, he was aware that the reservation had been made by the emperor’s chief eunuch himself.  

Under the curious, scrutinizing, and puzzled gazes of the crowd outside, Li Shiming entered Tianshui Pavilion and was led to the third floor.  

"Sir, this is as far as I can accompany you," the attendant said with a deferential smile.  

Li Shiming nodded. He understood—this was a gathering of cultivators, and mortals were not permitted to intrude.  

The third floor was simple in layout: a central hall flanked by three private rooms on each side. The hall appeared empty, so he assumed the gathering must be in one of the rooms.  

"Young Friend Li, you’ve arrived!" a voice called out just as he was about to search the rooms. A glowing portal appeared before him, revealing a hall filled with people.  

At the head of the gathering sat Gu Jia, who waved him over.  

It turned out the third floor had been concealed by an array formation. Even if a mortal had entered, they wouldn’t have seen the cultivators’ gathering.  

"Greetings, Daoist Gu. Greetings to all fellow Daoists," Li Shiming said, stepping through the portal and bowing to Gu Jia before offering a general salute to the others.  

His gaze swept over the assembled cultivators, recognizing a few familiar faces: the elderly Hao family elder who sold talismans, the Deng family’s artifact merchant, the Liu family’s herbalist, the Zhang family’s spellbook vendor, and a few others whose names he didn’t know.  

Of the twenty-six cultivators present, however, he had only met a handful.  

"Fellow Daoists, this is Young Friend Li, whom I’ve taken under my wing. I hope you’ll extend him your kindness," Gu Jia introduced warmly.  

"If Daoist Gu vouches for him, we naturally will," one cultivator immediately responded, with the others echoing the sentiment.  

Only the Hao family elder eyed Li Shiming with suspicion. There was something familiar about him, but the elder couldn’t place where they might have met.  

The Hao family had recently suffered a great humiliation—two of their cultivators had perished, significantly weakening their influence. The deaths of a third-layer and a fourth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator had even caused panic among the market’s regulars, deterring many from visiting.  

This gathering was a local tradition: meeting with Gu Jia on New Year’s Day to present the spirit stones owed for the coming year and to strengthen ties with him.  

The families managing the market didn’t want any single faction getting too close to Gu Jia, as it would disrupt the delicate balance of power.  

Submitting the spirit stones in advance was a necessary compromise. If the market underperformed, the excess payment would serve as a tribute to Gu Jia. If profits exceeded expectations, the difference would be settled at the next gathering.  

No one dared to manipulate the accounts—this wasn’t about individual family interests. They kept each other in check through mutual oversight.  

"Now, explain why you want to move the market into the city," Gu Jia said after introducing Li Shiming, returning to the earlier discussion.  

"Daoist Gu, this was a collective decision," Deng the artifact merchant replied, spreading his hands. "After the deaths of the two Hao family cultivators, visitors to the market dwindled. Even regular sellers are spreading rumors about safety concerns and refusing to come."  

Gu Jia pushed a cup of spirit tea toward Li Shiming with a smile. "Young friend, try this—it’s brought from my sect." Then he turned back to Deng, his expression turning stern. "Tell me the truth. What really happened?"  

Clearly, he understood the motives of these rogue cultivators. The deaths of the Hao family members had spooked them, and they now sought to leverage his influence to revive the market.  

But there was a difference between lending his name and actively providing protection. The latter carried risks.  

While few rogue cultivators could challenge Gu Jia, and most who came to Zhongdu were focused on joining sects rather than provoking an envoy of the Tianhai Sect, the world of cultivation was unpredictable. Asking him to take risks required a solid justification.  

Li Shiming took a sip of the spirit tea. The moment it touched his lips, a surge of spiritual energy exploded within him, and his Qi vortex eagerly absorbed it.  

Sensing the rapid growth in his cultivation, he didn’t hesitate—he drained the cup, even chewing the tea leaves.  

His Qi vortex devoured the influx of energy, expanding his reserves by over half. He could feel himself on the verge of breaking through to the third layer of Qi Condensation.  

His eyes gleamed with excitement. What kind of tea was this? A single cup had boosted his spiritual power so dramatically. Another, and he might advance right here!
