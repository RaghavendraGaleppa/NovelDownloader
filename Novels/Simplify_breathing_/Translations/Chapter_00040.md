# Chapter 40: Cleaned Out

[Cultivation Method: Clear Heart Art (Grand Completion)]

"I didn't expect the Clear Heart Art, upon reaching Grand Completion, could activate a special state."

Chen Fei recalled what just happened. The control he felt over his body and his surroundings was intoxicating. However, this state clearly had limitations; it was short-lived, and the aftereffects seemed considerable.

After resting for a moment, Chen Fei's dizziness improved slightly.

The special state of the Clear Heart Art significantly boosted his combat power. Aside from other benefits, the Three Immortals Sword that Chen Fei just executed could become a new killing move.

The Three Immortals Sword was a move recorded in the Immortal Cloud Sword manual, but Chen Fei had acquired a damaged version of the secret manual, where many of the move's explanations were almost nonsensical. Therefore, this Three Immortals Sword could only be considered a sword move Chen Fei created himself. Compared to the Immortal's Guidance, the Three Immortals Sword, with its three strikes combined into one, significantly increased its power.

Perhaps it could pose a slight threat to Marrow Tempering Realm martial artists. But only a slight threat, as Chen Fei's internal energy realm was too low; it was too difficult to fight across two major realms.

"Consider it an unexpected pleasant surprise."

A smile unconsciously appeared on Chen Fei's face. Just as he finished wiping the water from his face with a towel, a frantic knocking suddenly came from outside the courtyard.

"Steward Chen, is Steward Chen in?" Liu Jun's anxious voice called out.

The Zhang family's various resources were being carved up, and their collateral relatives were all driven out of the mansion, becoming displaced people. It wasn't just the Zhang family; two other aristocratic families also met with disaster, swallowed up by the rebel army and other aristocratic families under various pretexts.

"They really are cleaning them out, aren't they?" Chen Fei murmured to himself. After the various families handed over their resources, the rebel army immediately brandished their butcher's knives. Fearing too much backlash, they likely allied with the other families within Pingyin County to minimize their own losses.

There had always been friction and grudges among the various aristocratic families in the county, but they were usually restrained. Now, with the more powerful rebel army joining in, and having suffered so many losses previously, they naturally wouldn't miss such an opportunity to replenish themselves by slaughtering other families.

"Steward Chen, will something happen to us?" Liu Jun asked, his face pale. This was his greatest concern. With the Zhang family gone, would the Zhao family kill them all too?

"We just work at the medical hall, we're not direct descendants of the Zhang family. We should be fine," Chen Fei said. He thought for a moment, not entirely sure. Logically, the Zhao family shouldn't do anything to them. But in this era, how much logic truly applied?

"Bang, bang, bang!"

A sound like someone pounding on the door echoed. Chen Fei frowned slightly and stepped forward to open it. Three people stood outside, one of whom was holding a portrait and constantly comparing it to Chen Fei.

"Are you Chen Fei?"

"Thank you, Elder Zeng!"

Chen Fei looked up at Zeng Defang, noticing his weary expression. He figured the sudden demise of the Zhang family must have been a blow to him. After all, Zeng Defang had cooperated with the Zhang family for many years, and the Zhang family had treated him well; there was still some affection between them.

Now that he was with the Zhao family, they likely wouldn't treat Zeng Defang poorly. After all, Zeng Defang could refine the Light Spirit Pills, which were almost the highest-grade cultivation pills in Pingyin County. No aristocratic family would ignore such a cash cow.

The Zhao family patriarch soon entered the main hall and spoke some soothing words, which somewhat reassured the former employees of the medical hall and rice shop.

Chen Fei pretended to listen attentively, but his attention was focused on another person: Ling Hanjun, the bandit leader who had previously rampaged through the city. Chen Fei was greatly surprised to meet him here, especially since he was now an honored guest of the Zhao family.

Chen Fei had no intention of hiding; the face he had shown back then was fake. Now, he was just a harmless Skin Tempering Realm alchemist.

"I've heard Brother Ling has been looking for someone. Do you have any recent leads? If there's anything the Zhao family can help with, Brother Ling, please don't hesitate!"
