# Chapter 59: Sword Five

Chen Fei brandished his Fiery Pattern Sword. Although this sword art was remarkable, and Chen Fei had cultivated it to Grand Perfection, ultimately, Chen Fei was still a realm lower than He Yuanqiu. Such a gap in realms could not be bridged by a mere Fiery Pattern Sword, unless it were the complete Immortal Cloud Sword, not just the single move 'Immortal Points the Way.' Relying on the Clear Mind Art's control over his body, Chen Fei and He Yuanqiu were currently locked in an evenly matched struggle. However, both in terms of power and stamina, if they continued to exhaust themselves like this, Chen Fei would undoubtedly be the one to lose in the end.

"Clang!"

Another sword clash, and Chen Fei drifted backward with the force, arriving near Xu Zaichuan. Xu Zaichuan's eyes widened instantly. From then until now, he hadn't moved a muscle. It wasn't that he didn't want to move, but that he was completely unable to. If he dared to move, the wound on his neck would instantly split open, killing him immediately, with no other outcome.

"You dare!" He Yuanqiu's heart jolted in surprise, and he roared, charging towards Chen Fei.

In Chen Fei's eyes, He Yuanqiu's movements were reflected. Due to his concern for Xu Zaichuan, He Yuanqiu was clearly overexerting himself at this moment. His Eagle Claw Skill, which should have been flexible and controlled, now appeared more powerful, but in Chen Fei's eyes, this was not the case. Sometimes, more force wasn't necessarily better. Controlling the degree of force was the most crucial aspect.

"No need."

Chi Defeng knew Chen Fei's meaning: he was asking if Chi Defeng wanted to take revenge himself. But Chi Defeng had already seen that Xu Zaichuan was currently wishing he were dead. Although he seemingly had a chance to live, his entire neck was now in a delicate balance, and he was beyond saving. Moreover, this state was incredibly painful, just like how Xu Zaichuan had tormented others in the past; now, it seemed karma had returned to him.

Chen Fei nodded, but didn't leave immediately. He picked up the longbow from the ground, and with a flicker of his body, instantly drew the bow six times, sending arrows flying to various positions throughout the hall.

"Ah!" Screams instantly erupted. Not a single person escaped. Besides Xu Zaichuan, who remained standing, everyone else was struck by arrows and fell. Before leaving, Chen Fei also searched He Yuanqiu's clothes. There were no cultivation techniques or secret manuals, but there were some silver notes and broken silver, which disappointed Chen Fei slightly. As for Xu Zaichuan, being in his own mansion, he was only wearing a simple tunic, so it was clear at a glance that he had nothing on him. If there had been enough time, Chen Fei wouldn't have minded plundering the mansion. But doing so would be too dangerous. The commotion here just now wasn't small; people would likely arrive soon, and Chen Fei didn't need to take such a risk.

"Leaving the city isn't a problem, but joining that caravan might be difficult," Chi Defeng said. "They might even secretly inform Anfen City, and then either we'll have pursuers, or the caravan itself will detain us."

Chen Fei's expression subtly changed. He immediately understood the crux of the matter. Since Xu Wangliang held immense power in Anfen City, he would naturally spare no effort to hunt down Chen Fei and Chi Defeng. For the two of them to simply join a caravan and leave safely was not just a pipe dream, but an extremely risky endeavor. Drifting around outside the city next would be the most conspicuous thing, immediately signaling trouble.

The two fell silent, beginning to ponder various possible solutions.

"Wait, it seems we don't necessarily have to leave Anfen City!" Chen Fei suddenly looked up at Chi Defeng and said, "You and I are both in disguise. While these disguises are not bad, they are quite obvious to some people. So what if we simply use our true appearances within Anfen City?"

Chi Defeng was slightly startled, but then immediately reacted with understanding.
