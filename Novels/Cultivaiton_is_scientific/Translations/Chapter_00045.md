# Chapter 45: Talisman Crafting  

Red lanterns hung along the eaves outside the study. Today marked Li Shiming's first New Year in this world—three months had passed since his arrival.  

Had it not been for Manager Zhang and his team decorating with red lanterns, he wouldn’t have realized the New Year had arrived. The occasion made him think of his former world—his family, his friends—all now beyond reach. In this world, the only lingering emotion from his original body’s memories that affected him was his attachment to his father, Li Wenyuan.  

But his father wasn’t here with him now. The overwhelming loneliness drove him to seek distraction. He retrieved a talisman brush from his spatial storage—the *Snow Spirit Brush*, a far superior tool compared to the one he had purchased.  

This brush had belonged to a cultivator from the Hao family, naturally of higher quality than those sold to outsiders.  

On the desk lay a sheet of greenish-yellow talisman paper and a small dish of talisman ink. The ink had been painstakingly prepared in his spatial storage, its quality unquestionably refined to the utmost perfection using his consciousness.  

This particular ink was specialized for the *Primary Lightness Talisman*. He had bought some in the market, but he had also discovered a large stock of ink materials in the Hao cultivator’s storage pouch—enough to last him a long time.  

The principle behind talisman crafting lay in using the paper to solidify a pre-formed spell rune. However, the process was fraught with uncertainties—microscopic imperfections in the paper, uneven mixing of the ink, subtle fluctuations in the cultivator’s spiritual energy, the flow rate of energy through the brush, the fusion of energy with the ink, and more.  

In short, talisman crafting was an endeavor riddled with variables. According to the notes left by the Hao cultivator, succeeding in ten out of a hundred attempts was enough to earn the title of a *Primary Talisman Master*.  

This illustrated just how difficult talisman crafting truly was. Without extensive practice and substantial resource investment, it was impossible to cultivate a competent talisman master.  

Additionally, training a talisman master required time. Every attempt, whether successful or not, counted as a spellcasting—each consuming the cultivator’s spiritual energy.  

For Li Shiming, his current energy reserves only allowed him to cast *Lightness Technique* ten times. Even with a hypothetical 100% success rate, he could only produce ten *Primary Lightness Talismans* before needing to recover.  

Beyond energy, talisman crafting also drained mental focus—a resource even harder to replenish. In truth, no cultivator dared to exhaust too much of their energy or focus at once, as it would leave them defenseless.  

Through relentless practice and optimization using IBMz15, he had managed to stabilize his *Lightness Technique* casting time to one second—his current limit.  

With IBMz15’s analytical capabilities, this was the fastest he could cast the spell. Any further improvement would require stronger and more precise control over his spiritual energy.  

Li Shiming activated his five-sense connection with IBMz15, steadied his mind, and slowly channeled his energy into the *Snow Spirit Brush*. The brush emitted a soft glow as his energy passed through its inscribed rune formations, merging with the ink at its tip.  

Simultaneously, he began tracing the lightness rune on the paper with the intent of a convertible sports car. Yet, after just the first stroke, the talisman flickered erratically before exploding in his hands. The resulting energy surge scattered the items on his desk.  

Fortunately, crafting a *Primary Lightness Talisman*—a harmless spell—meant failure carried no destructive consequences. Had he been attempting a *Primary Fireball Talisman*, he would have had to be wary of explosions mid-process, which could easily injure him.  

He paused, connecting his consciousness to IBMz15 to replay the recording of the attempt. Through his five senses, he relived the moment, analyzing every detail.  

The cause of the failure became clear—a slight excess of ink in the stroke. The solution was simple: he needed to divert a thread of energy to precisely control the ink flow.  

Second attempt—failure. Third attempt—failure. By the fifth failure, he decided to cap his daily practice at five attempts.  

His energy reserves still needed to sustain daily castings of *Spring Rain Technique*, a task he couldn’t neglect. The remaining energy was reserved for emergencies—activating talismans still required energy, after all.  

Though Li Shiming had only practiced five times, his gains were substantial. Having studied *Introduction to Runes* and the Hao cultivator’s notes, he was already familiar with many potential pitfalls. But theory required practice to validate. Each failure provided invaluable experience.  

His greatest advantage over other cultivators was IBMz15’s recordings. While others might only recognize a failure occurred without understanding why, Li Shiming could replay and analyze every misstep, ensuring the same mistake wouldn’t be repeated.  

He checked a self-made pocket watch—already 1 PM.  

Entering his spatial storage, he prepared a bowl of spirit rice. Eating it plain in his study might have seemed austere to an outsider, especially on New Year’s Day.  

But that single bowl of spirit rice could be exchanged for its weight in gold—assuming a cultivator was willing to make the trade.  

Siqin, his maid, didn’t come to call him for meals. After recent explanations and several visits from Imperial Attendant Gu Jia, she had come to accept that her young master had begun cultivating immortality.  

This understanding granted him undisturbed solitude, ensuring his training and talisman crafting wouldn’t be interrupted at critical moments.  

A small bird fluttered through the window, alighting on his desk. Its intelligent eyes studied him briefly before the creature dissolved into a sheet of talisman paper.  

Li Shiming recognized it—a *Hundred-Mile Message Talisman*, a means of communication among cultivators. There were also *Thousand-Mile* and *Ten-Thousand-Mile* variants, each more expensive with increasing range.  

The *Hundred-Mile* version required precise knowledge of the recipient’s location and aura. If the recipient was absent, the talisman would linger until its energy depleted and self-destructed—typically lasting two days, sufficient for most messages.  

*"Young Friend Li, there’s a cultivator gathering on the third floor of Tianshui Pavilion. I’ll introduce you to fellow practitioners!"*  

The message was signed by Gu Jia—an invitation he had mentioned before. Li Shiming hadn’t expected the gathering to fall on New Year’s Day.
