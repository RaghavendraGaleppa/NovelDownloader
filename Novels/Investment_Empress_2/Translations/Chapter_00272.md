# Chapter 272: The Buddha's Realm in the Palm, Are They Planning a Date?

"What did the Divine Monk see?"

Tianjiao Xiao Li felt a chill run down his spine.

Hmm...

Actually, the question mark at the end could be removed.

If Divine Monk Huai Kong couldn't spot even a slight clue, he wouldn't deserve the title of Saint.

But.

Weren't all those competing for the Divine Jade from the Netherworld's outer realm supposed to be the demon clans of the Southern Border?

Had he ever stipulated that humans couldn't compete for the Divine Jade? He couldn't remember...

If he couldn't remember, then he hadn't.

Divine Monk Huai Kong had one flaw—he was forgetful.

"Making you all wait so long. The Divine Jade from the outer realm is right..."

Divine Monk Huai Kong stopped mid-sentence, turning his gaze to the side.

Beside him, Heng Yuan, who cultivated the Silent Meditation, let out a soft sigh and made a gesture.

"Oh... it's in this old monk's Buddha's Realm in the Palm."

Divine Monk Huai Kong nodded, then stared blankly for a moment, as if just remembering how to use the Buddha's Realm in the Palm.

He took out an alms bowl and gently tossed it.

The bowl suddenly grew from small to large, and the dark interior emitted a brilliant light. Within it, thousands of wondrous scenes appeared, as if it could contain the sun, moon, and the universe itself.

"The Way of Mustard Seed and Sumeru?"

Li Mo remembered hearing about this from the Ice Cube before.

The reason the Seventh Realm is called Profound Mastery is because, unlike the Sixth Realm, it carries a 'Dao' within it.

No wonder every main and side hall of the Suspended Sky Temple has its own unique world, like a Sumeru Treasure, yet even more powerful, capable of allowing living creatures to exist within them.

It seemed these were all created by this Divine Monk Huai Kong.

However, when Li Mo looked up, he felt the image of the Profound Mastery Saint in his heart slightly crumble.

"Put it here?"

"Master Uncle Abbot, this is the Night叉 Sea, the transformed remains of a Fourth Rank Demon King you once collected."

"Oh, then..."

"This is the Fire Prison, used to punish the disaster beasts that cause trouble in the temple!"

Divine Monk Huai Kong's Buddha's Realm contained all things.

The problem was his poor memory.

Li Mo even suspected that the old monk might forget he had eaten immediately after a meal and then go eat another one.

The Demons: "..."

"Right, I should have put it in the Five Elements Realm."

After searching for a long time, Divine Monk Huai Kong finally found the place where the Divine Jade from the outer realm was stored.

One could vaguely see the scene on the other side of the alms bowl.

It was a wondrous landscape composed of metal and stone mineral veins, vast forests, turbulent waters, volcanic magma, and desert gobi. The boundaries were distinct yet did not interfere with each other.

And at the center of the five regions, there was an extremely high and solitary peak, shimmering with magnificent divine light.

The Divine Jade from the outer realm!

The demons present had various expressions—some greedy, some yearning, some lost in thought.

Because for any demon, even just glancing at this divine light from afar, they could feel an indescribable tremor deep in their soul.

Even Li Mo was no exception, despite only having transformed into a Mingjiao.

"Yuhuang God..."

Ying Bing let out a soft breath.

This was one of the Nine Souls of the Primordial Phoenix that she had not obtained in her previous life.

Yuhuang God could make many demons revert to their ancestral forms, but that was merely its most superficial divine wonder. It represented the divine will of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix, representing its profoundness and the wisdom to nurture all things.

The answer to the question she most wanted to know might also be found within it.

Can the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands simultaneously allow two people to ascend to immortality?

If so, how should it be done?

"The Ice Cube is determined to get the Yuhuang God..."

Li Mo saw the gradually brightening light in the beautiful eyes of the young girl.

He also braced himself.

The many demons present were also eager to try, determined to take the Divine Jade into their hands.

"Please make your preparations, and enter the alms bowl."

A monk of the same profound cultivation level, a Law Body Realm monk, spoke up.

Every time the Divine Jade was contested, the young geniuses of the demon clans would make some preparations and use some methods before entering the Buddha's Realm.

The Suspended Sky Temple wouldn't interfere with that.

"Children, it's time to bring out the monkey wine we've been aging for thirty years!"

Not far away, a white-haired old macaque, seemingly in great pain, took out a tree stump and carefully split it open. A clear and refreshing wine aroma immediately wafted out.

Just smelling it made one feel a surge of heat flow through their body, clearly indicating its extraordinary potency.

A few younger white-faced macaques shared the wine and then entered the alms bowl.

"Hehe... hehehe..."

Shang Qinqing had been glancing back and forth between her own Green Luan Goddess and the peerless Tianjiao of the Mingjiao clan, occasionally letting out a "motherly smile." It wasn't until the clansman beside her reminded her that she coughed lightly.

She coughed seriously twice and said:

---

"I shall play a piece for you all, using the sound of the zither to help you achieve victory."

With that, she took out an ancient zither and began to play with her slender fingers.

The melody was ancient, continuous, distant, and ethereal.

"Listening to divine music, this must be what it feels like..."

Li Mo listened to the zither and discovered something miraculous.

His true energy was flowing faster, and even the operation of his seven Profound Dan was more seamless and natural.

Wonderful.

"The Way of Music from the Green Luan clan greatly enhances one's strength."

"Ah, really?" Wu Dameng looked puzzled.

"You didn't hear it?"

Li Mo was stunned. He looked up and saw the Green Luan Clan Leader, who was playing, wink at him, her eyes clearly filled with laughter.

Little Li understood immediately.

Her control over music had reached a point where she could choose who could hear it.

Among all the demons present, only he could hear it. It was a special treat just for him...

She's actually a pretty good person.

Actually, Li Mo had just had a brainstorm and came up with a genius idea.

The Way of Music can provide benefits to the target who listens to the zither.

And the person who has been benefited, after being benefited, can play a song that is even more powerful and effective.

So, can we have A play for B, then B play for C, and C play for A?

Wouldn't that allow the effect to increase endlessly, spiraling up to the heavens?

I'll tell her about it when I have time...

"Aunt Wu, did we prepare any methods?"

Li Mo asked as he turned around.

"Of course, but it's a bit stimulating. You'll have to endure it."

Wu Qing smiled, waving her hand to summon a patch of water that enveloped the five water clan members about to enter the alms bowl.

Stimulating?

How so?

Tianjiao Xiao Li, soaked in water, was confused.

"Man, I'm counting on you."

"Mm~~"

A woman with skin that seemed to be secreting oil, but with a very slender figure, wearing a seaweed skirt, stepped forward.

Li Mo recognized her.

Well, he could tell from the way she spoke.

"I~~~ a-m~~~ g-o-n-n-n~~~ a~~~ s-t-a-r-t~~~ (electronic voice)."

Her true form was a Purple Electric Cheek Eel, also a Fifth Rank Great Demon.

She snapped her fingers.

*Zap!*

A purple bolt of lightning struck down, instantly illuminating the water upon contact and spreading in the blink of an eye.

The five water clan members were electrocuted until their entire bodies went numb and their pores opened. Wu Dameng even rolled his eyes.

"It's an electrocution technique~~~!"

"We're done for~~~!"

"This~~~~ mm~~~?"

Tianjiao Xiao Li's body trembled violently. After the current ended, he spat out a puff of white smoke.

It was indeed stimulating, but for his physique, it wasn't painful to endure.

After his body was stimulated by the electric current, his reaction speed seemed to have increased.

But...

Why does my voice sound like an electronic voice now?!

Give me back my sexy, deep, bubbly voice!

*Pfft!*

The Green Luan clansmen not far away all laughed, but only Shang Qinqing's laughter was audible.

The corner of Ice Cube's mouth also couldn't hide a hint of a smile.

Just before stepping into the alms bowl, she turned her head and said softly:

"I'll be waiting for you at the peak of the Divine Jade."

"Okay, I will definitely come!"

Hearing the two make an agreement, the hearts of the demons couldn't help but itch.

They were planning a date.

The True Phoenix bloodline and the True Dragon bloodline, this pair of mortal enemies of the bird and water clans, were openly planning a duel!

Are they preparing to determine the victor before the Divine Jade from the outer realm?

Good, very good.

Even if it's just to watch their world-shaking battle and see who wins and who loses, they must strive to reach the peak of the Divine Jade!
