# Chapter 97: A Nine Tribulation Immortal's Doubt, True Disciple Hao Yun

With Bai Bier's words, Yang Ji's confidence swelled once more, and he ultimately secured the Mountain Sea Pearl for three million.

After the Mountain Sea Pearl, the auction drew to a close. Following the sale of a few more rare treasures, the auction concluded.

In the VIP room, a maid delivered two brocade boxes. One box contained a thumb-sized shard of the Primordial Divine Tree, resembling a fossilized amber, like a crystal with a woody luster. It felt surprisingly heavy in his hand. A subtle, almost imperceptible gleam of heat flickered in Yang Ji's eyes, but he quickly put it away without further examination.

The Mountain Sea Pearl was fist-sized, like a semi-transparent crystal orb. From its surface, one could discern naturally formed mountains, rivers, grasslands, and hills within. Only the creative power of nature could birth such a self-contained world treasure. Holding a world in his hand, Yang Ji experienced an extraordinary sensation, as if he were a high and mighty god, detached from everything. The Mountain Sea Pearl still needed to be refined before becoming his official magic treasure. Of course, this was not the place for refinement, so after a brief appraisal, he put it away as well.

"Fellow Daoist, I am truly grateful for your help this time," Yang Ji genuinely clasped his hands towards Bai Bier.

"Fellow Daoist, you are too kind. In the future, when I need your assistance, I hope you will lend your full strength," Bai Bier said with a smile.

"Within my capabilities, I will certainly go all out." As Yang Ji spoke, his gaze flickered, and he brought up the matter of purchasing wood-attribute spiritual items to Bai Bier. He explained that he was cultivating a grand divine ability of the wood attribute, which required absorbing the essence of ten thousand woods for cultivation. Such divine abilities were quite common. Just like at the auction earlier, a Grand Ascension cultivator mentioned needing Titanium White Fine Gold to cultivate the "Profound Vajra Slash." Cultivating that ability required absorbing the essence of gold to reach grand completion, after which a single golden slash could cleave mountains, sever peaks, cut off seas, and open skies.

Bai Bier didn't think much of it and turned to retrieve a large quantity of wood-attribute spiritual items, such as Ten-Thousand-Year Vajra Wood, Dragon Serpent Vine, Blood Amber Resin, and so on. Yang Ji's heart surged with excitement as he accepted them all. These treasures were also borrowed, added to his previous tab. After thanking her, Yang Ji departed from the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance.

The Buddha Child cried out via telepathy, "Revered Lord, that little woman Bai Bier's identity must not be simple! She handed over so many treasures without batting an eye. Could she be the daughter of some bigshot in the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance?"

"That woman is quite good-looking too, and rather enthusiastic towards you. Why not take advantage of the opportunity to take her down and seize her completely? Perhaps the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance branch in Wuji City will be yours in the future!"

"You think too simply," Yang Ji retorted, glancing back at the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance. His gaze flickered. "Bai Bier's identity is likely indeed not low. How could you casually manipulate such a person?"

During his conversations with Bai Bier, the words [Curiosity] and [Appraisal] had continuously floated above her head. Yang Ji didn't know what she was curious about or what she was appraising. It seemed that besides his Golden Finger, only his humanoid weapon was mysterious, but even that had been exposed and was no longer a secret. It seemed he had no more secrets, yet the woman's gaze remained full of probing intent, which greatly puzzled Yang Ji. This woman was very unusual. With her thoughts unmoving and her intentions unreadable, Yang Ji found it difficult to glean more information. However, he hadn't sensed any conspiracy or treachery, which was why he dared to trade with her in this manner.

Just as Yang Ji left the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance, the space behind Bai Bier suddenly rippled. A profound-eyed old man wearing an immortal crown slowly stepped out, traversing endless space.

"Grandpa," Bai Bier called softly upon seeing him. A hint of doubt was in her heart as she asked, "Grandpa, although he has some qi-luck, he is merely a Devil Emperor's inheritor. Why did you ask me to personally interact with him?"

"This person is somewhat strange!" The old man's eyes flickered slightly. "I have observed countless people and never made a mistake. Logically, a quasi-True Disciple of his caliber should have a flower of qi-luck above his head, yet he only has a few wisps of qi-luck. It's truly peculiar."

"My Qi-Luck Viewing Immortal Art is perfected; I can discern even a Nine Tribulation Immortal's qi-luck. Although I can see his, it just feels wrong somehow."

"If he had no qi-luck, how did he obtain the Devil Emperor's inheritance? How did he receive attention from the higher echelons of the Wuji Dao Sect? The qi-luck abundant Wang Tianli even exchanged techniques with him. These are all signs of excellent fortune."

"But if he does have qi-luck, then why are the strands above his head so few, like a bald old man? It's truly strange."

The old man was greatly puzzled, frowning. "This person's qi-luck is one of the few that makes me feel strange. Everyone else who puzzles me is either a Nine Tribulation Immortal or a Mortal Immortal."

"Yet this child is neither a Nine Tribulation Immortal nor a Mortal Immortal, and he actually makes me feel strange. How interesting."

"To better observe his qi-luck, I asked you to contact him and agree to all his requests."

"But even after satisfying all his requests, his qi-luck has not increased or decreased by a single fraction."

The old man paced back and forth, his brows slightly furrowed.

"There's such a thing?" Bai Bier was surprised. "I granted his conditions; his qi-luck should have increased. Why didn't it change?"

"That is also what I find strange," the old man's gaze flickered as he fell into deep thought.

"Could it be that he, like Grandpa, has also cultivated a qi-luck-related immortal art and perfected it, thus evading Grandpa's detection?" Bai Bier murmured, guessing.

"Impossible! How long has he cultivated? Even the most talented geniuses across the myriad worlds couldn't cultivate an immortal art to perfection in just a mere hundred years," the old man shook his head, refuting this conjecture.

"Then..." Bai Bier's delicate brows furrowed slightly.

"No need to rack your brain. If something is strange, consider it a prodigy. Just befriend this person; do not make an enemy of him," the old man suddenly stated.

"Understood, Grandpa." Bai Bier smiled faintly, the image of that figure resurfacing in her mind, and her curiosity deepened.

Yang Ji left the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance but didn't rush back to the sect. Instead, he wandered around Wuji City, entering various shops to search for spiritual items that could enhance his root bone, but found none. Just as he soared skyward, preparing to fly out of the city, two figures suddenly appeared in the white clouds ahead.

The leading youth was handsome as jade, serene and elegant, his eyes smiling and full of spirit and wisdom, truly extraordinary. The middle-aged man beside him had a dignified and imposing demeanor. Yang Ji, taking one look, was utterly speechless and exclaimed inwardly how unfair it was: the crown on the youth's head, the ring on his hand, and the robe on his body were all Dao artifacts. He was simply too extravagant.

As his gaze shifted and settled on the youth's face, Yang Ji was startled for a moment before instantly recognizing him. He had seen this face in the Myriad Treasure Mirror; it was the True Disciple, "Hao Yun." The rumored True Disciple Hao Yun, who could pick up treasures wherever he went. Yang Ji exclaimed in his heart, "No wonder," realizing it was a figure of such caliber.

A thought flashed through Yang Ji's mind. Although he didn't know why Hao Yun blocked his path, he maintained due respect, cupped his hands, and bowed, "Greetings, Senior Brother Hao."

"Junior Brother, don't be nervous. I stopped you to ask one thing: What was that wood-colored amber you bought?" Hao Yun took a step forward, smiling faintly.

Upon hearing his voice, Yang Ji knew that the youth who had competed with him at the auction was this very True Disciple Hao Yun. But how could he reveal the matter of the Primordial Divine Tree?

He immediately replied, "Senior Brother, I don't know what it is. Perhaps it's a fragment of a high-grade Dao artifact. I bought it to refine and use for forging my vital magic treasure."

"Oh? Forge a vital magic treasure? Such a small piece might only be enough for a needle-type magic treasure," Hao Yun's eyes flickered.

"I am a sword cultivator; I plan to refine it into a tiny flying sword," Yang Ji replied.

"Oh, so that's it," Hao Yun nodded blandly.

"Junior Brother, do you truly not know what that wood-colored amber is?" Hao Yun stared intently again.

"Junior Brother's horizons are too narrow; I truly don't know. I only know it's quite hard, comparable to top-tier materials, which is why I was interested. Why do you ask, Senior Brother?" Yang Ji suddenly counter-questioned.

"Oh, it's nothing." Hao Yun smiled. "Junior Brother, excuse the interruption." He looked at the middle-aged man beside him. "Let's go."

Two streams of light quickly vanished into the horizon.

"Revered Lord, if you believe that item is extraordinary, you could simply exchange a top-tier material with that disciple," the middle-aged man said.

"At the auction, when I first saw that treasure, my qi-luck intuitively told me it was extraordinary. However, after this Junior Brother placed his bid, I suddenly felt that the item wasn't as precious as I thought," Hao Yun frowned. "Could it be that he interfered with my qi-luck?"

"Revered Lord, you are the reincarnation of the Luck Venerable from the Immortal Realm. How could a mere disciple be worthy enough to interfere with your qi-luck?" The middle-aged man shook his head in disbelief.

"Indeed! Only an Immortal King could interfere with my qi-luck." Hao Yun chuckled then, no longer dwelling on the matter.
