# Chapter 23: Ice Toad Secretions

Jiang Li rested his chin on his hand, wearing an expression of deep contemplation as he recounted his personal experiences and the information displayed on his status panel.

"Mmm, go on, is there anything else?" The red-haired elder was clearly impatient—a temperament one wouldn't expect from someone who refined pills.

"Also, Elder, look—my throat is slightly swollen. The others' conditions are probably worse than mine, which should be the reason they're having trouble breathing." Jiang Li opened his mouth wide, even letting out an "ah" sound to show the elder his slightly swollen respiratory mucosa.

"Xiao Si! Check them now!" At the elder's prompt, the girl named Xiao Si immediately put on a pair of leather gloves and pried open the mouths of the other five disciples one by one, examining their throats.

Sure enough, each of them showed varying degrees of allergic reactions, with their airways significantly swollen.

"Airway swelling! So that's it, that's it!" The red-haired elder rushed to the medicine cabinet and pulled out two spirit herbs resembling aloe vera. After roughly mashing them into juice, he distributed it among the six. Soon, everyone's labored breathing subsided, and the status [Mild Acute Respiratory Allergy] on Jiang Li's panel also disappeared.

"Good, good, you're truly the best test subject I've ever seen. For this, I'll reward you with an extra spirit stone." The elder was overjoyed. Now that he knew about this side effect, he could adjust the formula accordingly, bringing him one step closer to perfecting this new pill.

"Thank you, Elder. Should I continue?" 

This elder's scatterbrained approach was baffling. Jumping from one thing to another without finishing his line of questioning—no wonder he kept running into obstacles.

"You have more observations? Excellent, speak quickly!" 

Jiang Li didn’t yet understand why the elder was so excited. Had he known the true value of a brand-new pill formula, he might have been even more thrilled himself.

"It's the skin. At first, my entire body itched briefly, and then I noticed my skin became slightly tougher—not by much, but definitely more resilient." Jiang Li pinched the skin on his arm. A 5% increase in toughness was subtle; without the panel's notification, he wouldn’t have even noticed.

"Hahaha! I knew it! I knew I’d succeed! It wasn’t my pill that was the problem—it was those useless test subjects! How could mere mortals possibly evaluate the quality of a spirit pill?!"

"This pill was developed based on the Stone Skin Technique—a Hardened Skin Pill! And you fools only felt an itch? What a waste of my efforts! You five, take your payment and get out!" The red-haired elder roared at the five outer sect disciples, berating them for their poor performance as test subjects. 

Fortunately, he didn’t withhold their compensation, or those disciples would have been left weeping in frustration.

"Jiang Li, was it? You’ve done exceptionally well. You deserve a reward. Do you know that our Alchemy Hall in the Hidden Scripture Valley has always been overshadowed by those bastards from the Hundred Refinements Mountain? Their new pills and formulas siphon countless spirit stones from our sect every year! As a member of Hidden Scripture Valley, Jiang Li, don’t you want to change that? Don’t you want to contribute to the sect?" 

The elder suddenly grew fervent, skillfully appealing to Jiang Li’s sense of "collective honor." 

*So this shameless rhetoric about "collective honor" is something every authority figure instinctively masters, huh?* Jiang Li cursed inwardly. *What does any of this have to do with me, a mere outer sect disciple?* 

Outwardly, however, he feigned deep emotion. "Elder, what should I do?"

"Jiang Li, I’ll give you five—no, seven extra spirit stones! Take another pill, how about it?" The elder looked at him eagerly, even sweetening the deal himself.

Jiang Li knew that this time, he’d be taking the finalized version of the pill, not the diluted experimental variant. The risks would undoubtedly be higher. 

But who was he to back down? 

"Very well, Elder. For the sect, for the new formula—I accept!" Jiang Li declared with righteous determination.

The elder was ecstatic. He immediately dashed to the medicine cabinet, swiftly grabbing handfuls of spirit herbs and arranging them on the table. Xiao Si hurried over to assist, expertly chopping and grinding the ingredients in preparation.

Among the materials, Jiang Li spotted the same herb used earlier to alleviate their respiratory allergies. The elder was planning to modify the formula on the spot and refine a new pill for Jiang Li to test. 

*Isn’t this way too rushed?* Jiang Li suppressed a scoff. He hadn’t agreed so readily because of the elder’s persuasion. In fact, had the elder not suggested it, Jiang Li might have proposed it himself. 

After all, he had his own reasons for volunteering as a test subject.

A mere [Weak Tough Skin] effect was far from enough to satisfy him. 

More—much more—was what he wanted.

Soon, the preliminary preparations were complete. The elder summoned a flame and blew it beneath the massive cauldron, over ten feet tall. The spirit fire of a brown bear roared to life, its scorching heat forcing Jiang Li to step back repeatedly.

"So hot!" Working in such conditions daily—alchemy was truly a grueling profession. 

Yet Xiao Si, her hair tied in a ponytail, moved effortlessly within the range of the cauldron, handing ingredients to the elder. Given her inner sect attire and the identity token at her waist, she should have only been at the Qi Refining stage. How was she unaffected by the heat?

"Junior Brother Jiang Li, what’s your spiritual root attribute?" Xiao Si suddenly asked.

"Ah? I have Yin and Wood dual spiritual roots." There was no need to hide it—it wasn’t something he could conceal anyway.

"Wood attribute? Perfect!" Xiao Si exclaimed excitedly before rummaging through a corner and producing a fan, which she handed to him along with a bottle full of Qi Restoration Pills.

"Help fan the flames. It’s simple. And I’ll make sure you get a little extra in your payment," she added in a conspiratorial whisper.

"Oh, and there’s a jar by the wall. Smear what’s inside on your skin, and you won’t feel the heat." She pointed in a direction before darting off to assist the elder again.

Following her gesture, Jiang Li spotted a jar against the wall.
