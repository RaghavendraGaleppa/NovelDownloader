**Chapter 76: Upgrade**

Although Tian Ling didn't arrive that afternoon, Zhou Tian didn't have to wait long. People from the Haotian Sect arrived the very next day.

Zhou Tian wasn't sure when Tian Ling would arrive, so he didn't go to pick her up. He saw her in the mansion where they were staying. Zi Xu and an unfamiliar young man were waiting outside; they were presumably also from the Haotian Sect.

The unfamiliar young man gave Zhou Tian a strange feeling. Though the young man looked ordinary and was simply dressed, there was an inexplicable aura about him.

Entering the mansion, Tian Ling was currently chatting with Zhou Ying in the main hall. Her skin was lustrous, her eyes bright, and her dark hair flowed gracefully. It seemed she and Zhou Ying were getting along very well.

"Zhou Tian, your fiancée has incredibly high talent. She's already in the Heaven Repository Realm," Zhou Zui remarked from beside him.

Hearing Zhou Zui's words, Zhou Tian chuckled, "Of course. Whose wife do you think she is?"

Zhou Zui was speechless, having never seen such a shameless person.

Seeing Zhou Tian enter from outside, Zhou Ying smiled, "See? He's here now."

Tian Ling also rose from her seat, a smile blossoming on her face as she stood quietly.

"Our Ling'er has become even more beautiful," Zhou Tian said, walking over and taking Tian Ling's hand.

Tian Ling's pretty face flushed slightly, her smile becoming even sweeter.

"Second Brother, why haven't I seen you these past two days?" Zhou Tian turned to Zhou Ying.

"Haha, Tian Ling, ever since you arrived, my third brother has become much more energetic. Normally, he wouldn't even say an extra word to me," Zhou Ying laughed. The Black Jade Kylin leaped from the table onto his shoulder, seemingly ready to depart. "Alright, I won't disturb you two. I need to leave soon; I have to discuss some plans with the people from the other major powers."

With that, he left.

After Zhou Ying departed, only Tian Ling and Zhou Tian remained.

"Ling'er, did you miss me these past few days?" Zhou Tian sat on a chair, Tian Ling standing before him.

"No," Tian Ling replied with a radiant smile, her large eyes twinkling with mischief.

"Didn't miss me? Then I'll have to punish you!" Zhou Tian straightened his face and pulled Tian Ling into his embrace. A series of indistinct smacking sounds followed.

In the afternoon, Zhou Tian took Tian Ling to explore the giant city. In the evening, the two parted ways.

Upon returning to his mansion and opening his room door, Zhou Tian was startled. A purplish figure stood in his room.

"Young Master, it's me," the purple figure spoke, and it was Zhou Shu's voice.

"You're Uncle Zhou's spiritual body, right?" Zhou Tian remembered that when Tian Ling left, Uncle Zhou's spiritual body had been sent to protect her.

"This is indeed my spiritual body, but at this moment, my true self is in control," the purple figure said.

"Oh, have there been any special circumstances recently?" Zhou Tian sat on the bed. He still didn't quite understand the distinction between a spiritual body and the true self.

"There have been no special circumstances since Miss Tian Ling returned to the Haotian Sect," the purple figure reported.

"Good. Oh, by the way, what's with that young man who came with the Haotian Sect this time?" Zhou Tian suddenly recalled the young man he had seen outside the mansion earlier that day, feeling there was something strange about him.

"He rose abruptly. Tian Qin's intelligence network in the Haotian Sect also feels there's something off about him. I personally attempted to probe his memories; there was nothing extraordinary, and his few fortunate encounters were explainable. However, it doesn't rule out someone of a higher cultivation realm working behind the scenes," the purple figure explained. It was merely a phantom, without facial features, but its words were clear.

"Understood." Zhou Tian nodded. Since this person could safely arrive here, it meant Tian Qin's intelligence network had ruled out any threat from him.

The purple figure then shared some news that Zhou Tian might find interesting, such as Zi Xu having broken through to the Dharma Aspect Realm with the help of the Saint King's remnant soul within him, becoming a leading figure of the current generation in the Haotian Sect, and so on.

As night fell, the purple figure dissipated. The distance from here to Tian Qin was great, and Uncle Zhou couldn't maintain the spiritual body's existence for long. Had it not been for the need to report to Zhou Tian, he would have already withdrawn his spiritual body.

With the spiritual body gone, Zhou Tian prepared for his daily routine. After his last death today, he would finally upgrade. Zhou Tian rubbed his hands together, full of anticipation, and vanished from his room.

Several hours later, Zhou Tian reappeared in his room, muttering curses under his breath, "Damn it, those guys' intelligence is really sharp."

Today, when he went looking for a place to court death, he found that those people seemed prepared. Their attacks were incredibly precise; they no longer used destructive divine abilities but rather restrictive ones. They even used various chains to bind him, as if playing some kind of bondage game. Fortunately, he had the divine skill [Teleportation], which allowed him to preserve his 'purity' for Ling'er.

He went to several places, and it was always the same. It was as if they had all received a message, as if a grand network was controlling them from behind the scenes.

But with just this last death, he could upgrade. How could Zhou Tian give up? After much thought, he decided to provoke the patrol guards.

Those soldiers truly lived up to their veteran status. The moment they saw Zhou Tian appear before them, they didn't even give him a chance to speak, immediately launching a spear charge.

A massive spear shadow pierced through Zhou Tian's body. Startled, Zhou Tian instantly teleported away after reviving. Fortunately, after dying seven times, his teleportation distance had increased to seven hundred meters. With a flashy, S-shaped maneuver, he finally escaped the patrol guards' pursuit and returned to his room.

He let out a sigh of relief and eagerly opened his Undying System. He had endured much suffering for this very moment.

Opening the skill page, three skills were shining brightly. Zhou Tian examined them closely.

**[Myriad Transformations: Design a virtual persona that no one can see through (Persona Slots: 7, related to death count)]**

A character customization skill? Well, this skill wasn't bad. Since no one could see through it, it was quite powerful for hiding one's identity. Later on, he could have many alternate identities and pull off many things. But first, he should look at the other skills.

**[Portable Space: Create a portable space that can be opened at any time without additional energy (Space Size: 7 cubic meters, related to death count)]**

This seemed a bit redundant, yet also somewhat useful. Zhou Tian had always yearned for a portable space; he'd always envied others who could reach into thin air and pull things out. But on second thought, it did seem a bit like a "chicken rib"—what would he even put in there if he had it? Clothes? Zhou Tian shook his head and looked at the last skill.

**[Blazing Burst: Summon a fireball to attack a designated target, dealing 5% of the target's current health as damage. Can be dodged (Daily Uses: 7, related to death count)]**
