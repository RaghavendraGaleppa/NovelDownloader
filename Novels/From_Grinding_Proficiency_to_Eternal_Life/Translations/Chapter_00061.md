# Chapter 61: Thousand Buddha Monastery

He turned to look at the group of blacksmiths staring at him with expectant eyes and said impatiently, "What are you looking at? Get to work quickly. If we miss the order, I'll flay the skin off all of you."

Though he was grumbling and cursing, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but浮现 a hint of a smile.

Old Man Lu had a sharp tongue but a kind heart. He held great prestige within the forge. He had even personally arranged the marriages for several of the blacksmiths.

"I'm off."

"Go on."

Watching Xu Yunfan's retreating figure, Lu Yi smiled and shook his head. Xu Yunfan possessed extraordinary talent, having achieved great mastery of muscle and skin at just twenty-one years old. This could be considered forging a good connection for the Divine Weapon Ridge.

He lowered his head again and swung his hammer.

For a time, the sound of 'clanging and clattering' filled the forge, mixing with Lu Yi's hoarse voice, melting into a farewell blacksmith's song in the spring breeze.

'Casting iron to build a bridge across the vast sea, refining weapons to create a boat to brave the martial world...'

The sound waves were so powerful they shook the newly sprouted green branches outside the forge. Xu Yunfan's steps were steady, each footfall leaving a firm imprint as he headed towards the Cloud Accumulation Mountain outside the city.

Xu Yunfan had just left the city when, a figure wearing a bamboo hat with thin gauze hanging down like a curtain, entered the city with the flow of people. It was Wan Miaoyin.

The plain gauze hanging from the dark green hat was stirred into ripples by the steaming heat rising from the market street. Wan Miaoyin's fingertips pressed down on the trembling gauze curtain, the silver-threaded sleeve embroidered with a pattern of thornless flowers barely covering the tip of her nose.

The shouts of vendors, mixed with the burnt aroma of scallion oil pancakes, struck her eardrums. White steam billowed from opened steamers, carrying the scent of fish and sweat, mingled with the fragrance of jasmine hair oil wafting from a cosmetics shop. It made her temples throb.

Inside her sleeve, her slender hand formed a Mind-Clearing Seal. A wisp of innate essence cultivated within her body slowly flowed through her flesh and blood, suppressing her keen five senses, finally pushing the surging nausea back down her throat.

Thirty years of secluded cultivation on the Celestial Pivot Mountain had left her unaccustomed to the foul, mundane energy of the mortal world.

She watched the live chickens fluttering in the vendor's bamboo basket, their tail feathers sweeping over muddy water stained with vegetable leaves. Her bare feet unconsciously stepped away onto the bluestone slabs by the roadside, only for her to stop immediately.

If she moved any further to the side, she might step in chicken droppings.

A rare frown appeared on Wan Miaoyin's cold, clear face.

This feeling of having nowhere to place her feet was a first for her.

Suddenly, a light breeze brushed past her face, sweeping over her temple.

Wan Miaoyin abruptly stopped. Beneath the thin gauze, her eyelashes trembled slightly, and her delicate nose couldn't help but sniff.

It was the scent left behind by the person Li Miaoyun had encountered back then. Aside from Li Haomiao, the Prince of Yan who had left for the Daoist sect, this was the most concentrated place.

But...

Wan Miaoyin raised her hand. Strange energy shimmered from her fingertips, rising and weaving into a vast net that spread over the entire Northern Ye City.

"It's everywhere..."

The scent Xu Yunfan left behind was scattered all over the city. In this case, she would need to explore bit by bit to find him.

This would inevitably be extremely time-consuming.

Wan Miaoyin felt a headache coming on. If she had known it would be like this, she would have rather not taken Li Miaoyun's innate essence. It was just too troublesome.

It would be better to return and report to her sect first, letting her master decide, and have her master discuss it with the Emperor.

The Thousand-Mile Tracking Art of the Celestial Pivot Gate was of little use in this era, let alone the fact that she didn't know the other party's vital energy characteristics or physical appearance.

Searching for him would be like looking for a needle in a haystack.

But if she did nothing and returned empty-handed, the elders in the sect would surely have many opinions.

"Still, I should send a message to my master first, then slowly search for myself."

Wan Miaoyin made her decision. She began to walk slowly and cautiously through the city, her energy covering her feet, not daring to be the slightest bit careless.

Stepping out of the city, Xu Yunfan's feet shattered the yellow earth of the suburbs. The muscles and sinews throughout his body relaxed like a tightly coiled bowstring suddenly released.

The great dragon of his spine connected through each segment. With power surging from the soles of his feet, the large tendons in his legs twitched as if being pulled. His entire body shot towards the Cloud Accumulation Mountain and the Thousand Buddha Monastery like an iron arrow released from a bow.

Back in the eight hundred miles of barren, icy plains, he had to leap and climb between ice crevices. The path was rugged, with cliffs and precipices everywhere.

Now, on the flat official road, the power unleashed from each of his shin bones transformed into a straight, forward-propelling force.

The scenery on both sides twisted into colorful bands. The wind in his ears was sharp as a knife, yet he could clearly hear his own heart pounding like a war drum. His vital energy and blood boiled like water. Under the heart's pumping, the blood in his body flowed rapidly, and various hormones surged.

With every heartbeat and every step he took, it was like a giant elephant charging into battle. Fifteen meters were covered in an instant.

This time, with his full power, his speed was far, far greater than it had been in the eight hundred miles of barren, icy plains.

Not to mention that his Great Mastery of Flying Leg had made his speed even more astonishing.

Reinforced by the vital energy system of Flying Leg, his legs were incredibly strong. With a slight exertion, his muscles pulled like steel wires, his tendons twitched, and a force seemed to rise from the earth beneath his feet, 'pushing' him forward.

After eight hundred heartbeats, the bronze-colored mountain gate of the Thousand Buddha Monastery at the foot of the Cloud Accumulation Mountain came into view.

Before leaving, he naturally wanted to visit the Thousand Buddha Monastery to check the situation. A wooden statue like the Bodhisattva of Power Awareness meant the monastery was definitely not simple.

There might be an opportunity for him to truly step into the threshold of the Word Seal of Lin.

When the morning bell of the monastery shattered the thin mist in the mountains, Xu Yunfan was standing before the Nine-Curved Lotus Steps.

The extremely luxurious white marble steps were carved with the full text of the Diamond Sutra. The cloth shoes of pilgrims coming and going had worn the text smooth and lustrous.

Ascending the steps, eight hundred Arhat statues were arranged in a staggered manner according to the mountain's terrain. Some held mudras of teaching with smiling, downcast eyes, while others held vajra pestles with furious, wide-open eyes. The lapis lazuli inlaid for their pupils reflected a treasure-like glow with the changing sunlight, as if they were truly gazing down upon all living beings.

Below the monastery, pilgrims were as numerous as weaving threads; the flow of people was no less than that in Northern Ye City.

What surprised him most was that many of them carried martial arts skills, and many had a fierce aura, with an extremely strong scent of blood.

He felt something was amiss.

"It's long been said that the Thousand Buddha Monastery has incense as flourishing as a pot. The abbot, Master Huichan, is a high monk of Buddhist law, and his reputation is well-known even throughout the Great Zhou. Seeing it today, the reputation is well-deserved..."

A scholar-dressed traveler next to him suddenly lowered his voice. "I heard that before the Empress ascended the throne, this master was often invited into the palace by the late Emperor to preach the Dharma. But after the Empress took power, she despised Buddhism and revered Daoism, so naturally, there was no more attention."

No wonder. No wonder the Thousand Buddha Monastery, though located in Qingzhou in the northern border, a small city, was still so prosperous. The sandalwood incense mist spread from the bluestone steps all the way up to the monastery, which was enough to show how much incense was burned daily.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered slightly as he slowly ascended the steps.

When he reached the front of the Grand Hall, the guest monks welcomed and sent off guests, each with lips as red as cinnabar and teeth as white as jade, with handsome and pleasing appearances.

Looking up, twelve gilded sutra banners hung from the eaves of the Grand Hall. When the wind passed, the embroidered Heart Sutra on the banners was faintly visible.

Entering the Grand Hall, three ten-zhang-tall gilded Buddha statues sat in the lotus position, each holding a lotus platform in their palm.

After touring the entire Thousand Buddha Monastery, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh at its extreme luxury and magnificence. Although the gilded Buddha statues weren't made of pure gold, the gold plating alone was truly unimaginable.

The place with the most flourishing incense was undoubtedly the Thousand-Hand Guanyin Pavilion.

In the dense sandalwood mist, each of the eleven-faced Guanyin's palms held an eternal butter lamp.

Unfortunately, Xu Yunfan didn't sense any ominous aura, nor did any information prompt pop up on his attribute panel.

He didn't even see a single one of the Bodhisattva of Power Awareness statues that Qin Bo had mentioned.
