# Chapter 458: The Cycle of Three Lifetimes Is Just This

The Arhat Fulong's fury erupted, the veins on his neck swelling like coiled serpents as the Buddhist light around him trembled violently. Just as his wrathful visage was about to fully manifest, he suddenly closed his eyes and recited a Buddhist chant. The boiling aura receded like a tidal wave.

Such effortless control over his power made Xu Yunfan's pupils contract. The tyrannical aura that had seemed capable of shattering the city gate had vanished as if it never existed.

Xu Yunfan's fingers moved slightly, a faint blue light of array patterns shimmering between them as he prepared to connect to the core of the mountain-protecting great array deep within the寒鸦关 (Cold Crow Pass)'s earth veins.

Suddenly, his expression changed. The Arhat Fulong's seemingly casual stance had his right foot precisely on a node for activating the array, and his left palm, larger than a fan, was hovering over a key energy linkage point.

This bald donkey had actually figured out the layout of the mountain-protecting great array set up by the Primordial Origin Sect in Cold Crow Pass so thoroughly, completely cutting off the flow of the array's power.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes. Cold Crow Pass must have been thoroughly infiltrated by the Bodhi Pure Land; even the crucial mountain-protecting great array had been completely deciphered.

"Amitabha."

The Arhat Fulong pressed his palms together, and suddenly seven layers of Buddhist light appeared behind his head, within which the shadows of Black Tortoises rose and fell. "Why struggle in vain, Benefactor Xu? The 'Xuanming Seven Fiends Array' is based on the yin fiends of Cold Crow Pass that have accumulated for a thousand years, secretly aligning with the opportunities for killing with yin fiends. When this old monk was comprehending the true principles of the Black Tortoise a hundred years ago, I once saw this array mentioned in the 'Essentials of Earthly Fiends' left behind by a true person of the Primordial Demon Sect."

He had met a true person of the Primordial Demon Sect...

A cold glint flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. It was likely that someone had set a trap, luring him out to be surrounded and killed.

Before the words had fully faded, Xu Yunfan suddenly merged his fingers into a sword and slashed them across his chest.

The attainment of the Initial Explanation of Array Dao was fully displayed at this moment. The spiritual power brought by his fingertips traced an arcane trajectory in the air, forcibly reconnecting the array patterns that had been severed.

A thunderous rumble came from deep within the earth veins, and the city walls of Cold Crow Pass suddenly lit up with dense, dark golden talismans.

What kind of trick is this?!

Hadn't Xu Yunfan only taken over Cold Crow Pass a few days ago? How could he have figured out the脉络 (veins/structure) of this mountain-protecting great array so quickly, and even be able to make further adjustments and improvements?

The opponent was also well-versed in array dao!

The Arhat Fulong's expression changed drastically.

The blue bricks beneath his feet suddenly turned into quicksand, and seventy-two chains shot up from underground, their links inscribed with the "Yin Fiend Talisman Script" unique to the Primordial Origin Sect. What was even more terrifying was that the entire sky suddenly twisted and cracked like a mirror surface; the originally clear night sky with a bright moon and sparse stars was rapidly shrouded by layers of black clouds, dyeing the heavens ink-black in an instant.

The Nether River around Cold Crow Pass churned violently. Amidst the frantic stirring of thousands of pale arms, seven streams of sword qi, carrying overwhelming yin fiends, shot up from the river bottom, like seven evil dragons breaking free from the abyss.

"Great Wheel Guardian King Escape!"

With the Arhat's furious shout, his muscles swelled as if inflated. The ochre monk's robe instantly shattered, revealing a bronze-colored body covered in dragon scale patterns. The tattoo on his right arm materialized into a real Azure Dragon coiling around his arm; the dragon's head bit down on the Demon-Subduing Pestle and slammed it heavily into the ground. With a thunderous boom, the golden ripples emanating from the pestle's tip actually shattered the space into a spiderweb of cracks.

Xu Yunfan's expression showed a hint of surprise.

He saw the Arhat Fulong's pores all over his body oozing blood, but at the instant the blood droplets splashed, they transformed into countless crimson Sanskrit characters. Those Sanskrit characters burrowed into the void like living creatures, and along with the Arhat's main body, they turned into a blood-colored rainbow, escaping outside the pass just before the yin fiend sword qi could encircle him.

"Want to run?"

Xu Yunfan sneered from atop the city wall, drawing a pitch-black longsword from the void with a reverse hand. The moment the sword blade appeared, the True武 (Martial) Sword Qi that can shake the demons surged forth like an ink-black dragon leaving the abyss.

The entire Nether River immediately boiled as if cooking; the viscous river surface churned violently, raising black waves more than ten zhang high. Even more terrifying were the countless twisted faces that appeared within the waves; the ghosts imprisoned in the Nether River for ten thousand years were actually scrambling to throw themselves at the sword qi. They tore at each other's rotten bodies, forming layer upon layer of pale human walls on the river's surface. The shrieks emitted when they were shredded by the sword qi shook the mountain rocks on both banks into crumbling dust.

The ghosts, one after another, squeezed the Nether River into an even greater frenzy. The sound of the muddy waves crashing against the shore was like the rolling of thousands of thunderclaps, causing even the walls of Cold Crow Pass to tremble slightly amidst this insane self-destruction. These souls that had fallen into the Nether River could never reincarnate, so naturally, they wanted to use this opportunity to seek liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

Xu Yunfan swept a cold gaze over the surging ghosts in the Nether River, and his fingers suddenly formed a hand seal. The dark golden talismans on the Cold Crow Pass walls shone brightly in response, and seven yin fiend chains shot out from the array's core, twisting into the boiling Nether River like giant pythons. The struggling pale arms immediately let out piercing wails, forcefully pressed back to the river bottom by the talisman scripts flowing on the chains. When the muddy waves calmed, the river surface actually condensed a layer of ice-crystal-like black fiendish energy, sealing the thousands of ghosts back into eternal oblivion.

At this time, the Arhat Fulong revealed his figure three hundred zhang away, the Azure Dragon tattoo on his right arm already dim and lacking light. When he saw the longsword in Xu Yunfan's hand, his turbid pupils contracted violently, and the dragon patterns on his neck twisted uncontrollably.

Thirty years ago, when he was at the Foundation Establishment stage, he had sensed the appearance of the True武 Sword somewhere in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World. After searching for three years to no avail, he had to use the Demon-Subduing Pestle as a substitute. Seeing it with his own eyes now, he discovered that the Dao patterns on the sword body perfectly契合 (aligned with) his own cultivation method, as if it should have belonged to him all along.

"The True武 Sword?!"

The Arhat Fulong's expression was incredibly complex. Back then, to find this treasure that accompanied the True武 Demon-Subduing True Sutra, he could be said to have searched high and low.

"Who would have thought it actually fell into the hands of the Primordial Demon Sect..."

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel a touch of sorrow in his heart.

"The timing, the destiny... could it be that I truly cannot achieve the Dao with this?"

This thought had just arisen when the Arhat Fulong suddenly felt his spiritual platform clear up. The obsession from the cycle of three lifetimes melted away like ice and snow, and the restless dragon patterns on his neck gradually calmed down. He looked down at the golden-red Buddhist blood seeping from his palms and suddenly let out a great laugh: "Excellent! This child is not a calamity, but this old monk's opportunity!"

The tattered robe fragments moved without wind, and the Buddhist light around him shifted from gold to dark. The True武 Xuan Gong that he had been stuck at a hair's breadth from for thirty years was now, under the pressure of life and death, circulating on its own to perfection. The incomplete Black Tortoise and Snake phantom in his Dantian suddenly solidified, resonating wonderfully with the True武 Sword in Xu Yunfan's hand.

Sensing the movement in the True武 Sword in his hand, Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. With the infusion of True武 spiritual power, the True武 Sword immediately calmed down.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan thought to himself.

It seems that after returning, I will have to nourish it with my mind and spirit before I can wield it as easily as my own arm.

"So that's how it is..."

The Arhat's expression was serene. Bronze-colored body markings, identical to the Big Dipper star patterns on Xu Yunfan, appeared on his skin. "The essence of the 'True武 Demon-Subduing True Sutra' lies in the two words 'Demon-Subduing'. This old monk cultivated bitterly for three lifetimes, and only today do I know that the demon I sought to subdue was the obsession in my own heart."

He suddenly tore open his tattered monk's robe, revealing the slowly forming Black Tortoise and Snake tattoo on his chest. The '卍' (wan) character Buddhist seal of the Bodhi Pure Land was crumbling inch by inch amidst the entanglement of the Black Tortoise and Snake.

Destruction precedes creation!

Xu Yunfan was surprised in his heart. The Bodhi Pure Land truly had unique methods in the art of cleansing the heart, capable of producing such a change.
