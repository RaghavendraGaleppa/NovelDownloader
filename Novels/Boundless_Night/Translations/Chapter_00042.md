## Chapter 42: Dispelling Doubts

Shen Jiayun’s body stiffened slightly, her ears clearly perceiving the air currents stirred by the trembling spear tip, as if she had been lightly brushed. It was also the first time an outsider had helped her fasten that hair ornament. She pulled out the shimmering blue bead flower from her waterfall-like black hair and held it in her hand.

Qin Ming retracted his spear, then turned to return it.

The owner of the purple-gold spear felt a bit awkward. Earlier, when he lent out the spear, he had boasted that it was an indirect battle with Nie Rui, clearly a compliment. Now that he had his weapon back, how could he praise Nie Rui? Was he supposed to boast that his spear had defeated Crimson Cloud City’s two strongest twin stars in twenty years? He decided it would be best to put the spear away once he got home. Using it again would be too conspicuous, constantly reminding everyone of today’s great battle, and of how Nie Rui and Shen Jiayun had both been defeated by the same person.

Mu Qing spoke without reservation, saying, “You should keep this spear well; it has great commemorative significance.”

The young noble holding the spear suddenly felt extremely awkward, his embarrassment doubling.

It was only then that many people finally came to their senses. It was hard to imagine Nie Rui and Shen Jiayun being defeated by a teenager whose physical constitution was inferior to theirs.

“That young man’s spear technique has a profound simplicity to it, subtly drawing the line between life and death in an understated manner, truly embodying the essence of combat arts!” Several nobles nearing thirty years old, all having undergone three rebirths, remarked with keen insight.

“His killing aura was restrained; initially, he moved as if strolling through a garden, listening to spring rain. Then, suddenly, he connected with heavenly lightning, his spear shadows erupting like electricity. Truly extraordinary.”

The twin stars, who had astounded Crimson Cloud City, experienced defeat in a remote region, and by a peer no less. This naturally had a significant impact. If news spread, few would believe it. But the real battle results were plain for all to see, witnessed by a group of young nobles.

“So valiant and dashing! The grace of that spear move truly dazzled my eyes,” a noble girl whispered.

“Oh, look, Shen Jiayun is holding the bead flower, momentarily lost in thought.”

...

Shen Jiayun gracefully landed on the black tiger’s back and departed with the group of nobles. The crowd dispersed. Before their farewell, Crimson Cloud City’s twin stars had specifically spoken a few more words to Qin Ming, saying that the Night Mist World was vast and full of mysteries, and they looked forward to meeting again in the future, each having reached a higher peak.

As the young nobles left, they all took a deep look at Qin Ming. Some also approached him to chat briefly, telling him to look them up if he ever went to Crimson Cloud City.

This battle was purely accidental and unexpected, but it did allow Qin Ming’s name to enter many ears even before he set foot in Crimson Cloud City. In the eyes of many, although his physical constitution was not among the strongest, his combat method, which transformed the ordinary into the extraordinary, and his superb on-the-spot execution left a profound impression. His combat talent was rarely paralleled, making him quite formidable and remarkable—a rapidly rising brilliant new star.

“He’s actually that formidable? He even beat Nie Rui into submission! After this battle, Nie Rui will no longer hesitate and will take a different path.”

In Black-White Mountain, other young nobles were surprised to hear this. Some even came specifically to see what Qin Ming looked like. Cao Long, Mu Qing, and Wei Zhirou stepped forward, finally helping Qin Ming fend off much of the trouble, and things gradually settled down.

“Qin Ming, by early spring next year, no later than midsummer, you should go to Crimson Cloud City to register. It’s a bit of a pity, though, that your current strength is still a bit low,” Mu Qing said.

“Huh?” Qin Ming was puzzled.

Wei Zhirou explained, “At that time, you might have the chance to access higher-level knowledge. Even advanced qi-cultivation techniques, which are usually kept secret, you might be able to learn parts of.”

Cao Long added, “Large cities will come to select people then. As long as you perform brightly enough, you’re very likely to get a life-changing opportunity.” If Qin Ming hadn’t unexpectedly fought and defeated Nie Rui and Shen Jiayun today, Cao Long and Mu Qing wouldn't have told him these things, as there would have been little point.

“If all else fails, you can study in Crimson Cloud City for a year and wait for the opportunity next year. If you can undergo three rebirths, your chances will be greater, and you might then be able to enter a more renowned large city.” They knew that those with a golden foundation would soon be able to undergo a second rebirth, but that wasn't enough. Unless one possessed 'divine wisdom,' special abilities, or rare innate endowments, it would be difficult to be highly regarded early on.

Xu Yueping and Yang Yongqing knew that when spring arrived, Qin Ming would most likely leave this place.

Qin Ming inquired about the situation in detail. Since it was casual conversation, he freely asked many other questions, but all of them subtly. For instance, when discussing what spiritual substances could help people undergo rebirth, Cao Long casually mentioned "mineral essence," and Qin Ming seized the opportunity to ask for more details.

“Mineral essence is an active substance extracted from mineral veins. Drinking it can enhance physical constitution, but whether one undergoes rebirth depends entirely on luck. Even so, it is still extremely expensive.”

“Why?” Qin Ming asked.

Cao Long replied, “Because as long as it’s your first time consuming mineral essence, no matter how many times you’ve undergone rebirth, it can improve your physique, and there’s a fifty percent chance it can help you undergo rebirth again.”

Wei Zhirou said, “That’s its most precious aspect. It’s highly sought after by some old people whose strength is hard to improve, because other conventional methods can no longer help them undergo rebirth, but mineral essence offers that possibility.”

Qin Ming asked, “Does it have no effect the second time you take it?”

Mu Qing responded, “It’s not entirely without effect; it might have about one-tenth of the first time’s effect. Besides, unless you can obtain a higher-grade mineral essence, like a vibrant red one, radiant as an evening glow, known as the Blood of the Earth. Even in Crimson Cloud City, you might only see one or two bottles a year.”

From her words, it was clear that even higher-grade mineral essences existed, which could only be found in large cities. Qin Ming knew that they would likely be leaving in two or three days, so he chatted more, naturally asking various questions.

When the topic of mysterious products within nodes came up, Qin Ming inevitably wanted to understand the special qualities of Suet Jade Iron. The three were also very interested in this topic and talked animatedly.

“Every time the heavenly light descends, it nourishes many extraordinary treasures. Some incredibly rare materials, when refined into mysterious weapons, can be passed down through generations, protecting and prospering a family. There are even unparalleled mysterious products that can serve as national treasures.” Cao Long’s eyes burned with fervor. This was why he actively searched in the mountains; any grade of product could potentially exist within a node.

“Though Suet Jade Iron is not among the rarest, it is extremely valuable, far surpassing ordinary iron, and its uses are extensive.” Finally, the three mentioned the information Qin Ming wanted to know. Suet Jade Iron does not require extensive forging; even refining it ten thousand times would add nothing to it. Its material is excellent. When forged into a weapon, it can cut open the scales of giant beasts and poses a significant threat to those protected by heavenly light.

This wasn't the most important aspect, as some weapons made from other materials were also sufficiently tough and incomparably sharp.

“If a weapon or armor forged from Suet Jade Iron is damaged, as long as it’s not too severe, it can slowly recover its integrity through nourishment from heavenly light.”

Qin Ming was astonished. Such weapons and armor truly were quite miraculous.

“The most wondrous quality of Suet Jade Iron is that holding it allows you to slay certain special entities.”

This statement startled Qin Ming; he realized how little he understood about this world.

Mu Qing explained, “In this vast and boundless pitch-black world, how many areas have fire springs? Though the large cities are dazzling, under the boundless night, they are merely faint firefly spots. The more expansive regions are ink-black, deep as an abyss, and there are always inexplicable, indescribable entities. Sometimes, only relatively rare weapons like Suet Jade Iron can deal with them.”

Qin Ming asked her to elaborate, as he was completely bewildered.

Mu Qing said, “For example, some things you can’t see with your eyes. Stabbing them with an ordinary spear would be useless, the spear tip seemingly piercing only air. But if you switch to a weapon forged from Suet Jade Iron, one thrust might pierce out a string of bizarre blood-flowers, slaying whatever it is.”

Qin Ming sighed, “I’m in a remote area and know nothing of these things. The boundless, pitch-black world is truly too mysterious.”

Wei Zhirou interjected, “Why do some secret cults worship deities? It’s precisely because of all the unknowns and mysteries. Some things are unspeakable, unexplainable.”

Old Liu patted his chest, saying, “Fortunately, we don’t have any of that here.”

Mu Qing chuckled, “How do you know, old man? Even if they exist, ordinary people just can’t see them.”

“Don’t scare me! The older I get, the more cowardly I become. I still want to live for a few more decades.”

Cao Long said, “Don’t worry. Even we have never seen them.”

Qin Ming thought for a moment and asked, “Are transcendent beings all very powerful?”

Wei Zhirou nodded, “Some transcendent beings’ paths are incomparably glorious, beyond comparison.”

“How strong are they?” Qin Ming asked. He really wanted to know, because the youth who had severely wounded him wore feathered robes and was likely a transcendent being.

Mu Qing said, “Don’t think too much about it. For now, you just need to focus on improving yourself. Once you enter a large city and your strength rises again, if you are found to have special innate endowments, you can change your path then.” Although they didn't say much, it was enough to convey the terrifying nature of transcendent beings. Moreover, judging from their words, they themselves seemed to have changed their paths.

Qin Ming pondered for a moment and knew that they were not ordinary Reborn. One had already taken the Juling God path, and another had a tail. Wei Zhirou, who was with them, must also have something special about her.

After enduring another sleepless night, Qin Ming finally fell into a deep slumber, which completely relieved him; being unable to sleep was truly agonizing.

During this time, the giant beasts from Crimson Cloud City, pulling grain carts, finally transported the food across the snow-blocked mountain roads. The entire region immediately erupted in excitement. Although the grain prices were slightly higher, considering the transportation costs, this was already a very sincere price, fundamentally aimed at easing the difficulties.

“No need to panic buy. Rest assured, the grain prices will not increase, and more will be continuously delivered.”

...

Cao Long, Mu Qing, Wei Zhirou, and others were already packing their belongings, preparing to return. However, news came from the mountains that several special nodes had been discovered in a great rift valley region, and more nodes were continuously being found.

Immediately, three groups of people rushed into the mountains, asking Qin Ming, Old Liu, and others to lead the way. This time, some old figures also joined the team, such as Cao Long’s Seventh Uncle, who had eaten the Longevity Tree fruit. Yang Yongqing's black goat, seeing him, immediately urinated in deference. Old Liu's large yellow dog also had a stress reaction and promptly defecated. Seeing this, Cao Laosan's Seventh Uncle nearly twisted his nose in anger, yelling that he would eat black goat meat and yellow dog meat later. The others wanted to laugh but had to hold it in.

“After you’ve led us to the location, you won’t need to participate. That place is too dangerous!” Cao Long stated. Without a doubt, this would be their last action before leaving, and a major battle was likely to erupt. With nodes appearing densely, all factions would fight with bloodshot eyes.

Indeed, after Old Liu led the group to the great rift valley, he immediately pulled Qin Ming, Xu Yueping, and Yang Yongqing and ran back to the village. Old Liu said, “We’ve been safe through ninety-nine trials, and we’re just one last push away from the end. We absolutely must stay away from there and maintain our safety baseline; as long as nothing goes wrong, we’ll be fine!”

Although Qin Ming had a certain reliance—he wouldn't be corroded by the heavenly light inside the nodes and could remain unharmed—he ultimately held back. At this point, not only would the people from Crimson Cloud City fight with bloodshot eyes, but even the unusual beings in the mountains would likely be drawn there.

However, some local organizations were ruthless, ordering various villages to send people to join them in the mountain operation. The messenger was a Reborn from Golden Rooster Ridge, who arrived riding a swift-running ground fowl. He was merely a subordinate this time, acting under orders; true great marauders from Golden Rooster Ridge had arrived. In this final stage, their eyes had also turned red, wanting to seize the mysterious products of Black-White Mountain.

“This isn’t just our family’s decision. We’ve allied with the Three-Eyed Cult. You weigh the consequences yourselves. If you truly don’t send people, there will be repercussions later!” This was clearly a threat; if they didn't comply, they would face retaliation afterward.

“Each village must send people based on its population, but they must be Reborn.”

Qin Ming immediately understood: these people feared the heavenly light within the nodes and wanted to find substitutes to go in and search for them. They truly didn’t treat the Reborn from the villages as human beings and didn’t care about their lives.

“I’ll go!” Qin Ming insisted on pushing Old Liu, Xu Yueping, Yang Yongqing, and the others back. For a small village like theirs, one person was enough. He calmly followed the Reborn from Golden Rooster Ridge into the mountains, but a killing intent steadily surged within his heart.
