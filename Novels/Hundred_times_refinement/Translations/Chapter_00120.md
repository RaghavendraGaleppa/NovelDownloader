# Chapter 70: Supreme-Grade Elixir

In the world of cultivation, elixirs are classified into four grades: low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, and supreme-grade.

Take the Marrow-Cleansing Pill as an example. Low-grade ones are the most common, while mid-grade ones are extremely difficult to refine. However, renowned orthodox sects and powerful demonic factions, relying on their abundant resources and experienced alchemists, can still produce a few batches.

As for high-grade pills, they are exceedingly rare. Though the major sects have managed to preserve a handful through generations, these are said to be produced only by sheer luck—accidental successes during refinement.

Then there are the supreme-grade elixirs.

To be honest, hardly anyone has ever seen one. They exist only in ancient legends. It's said that supreme-grade elixirs might have existed in the distant past, when ancient cultivators possessed unfathomable abilities. But in the present era... some sects, unwilling to accept this, have poured vast resources and manpower into attempting to refine them, only to end up with nothing.

In other words, supreme-grade elixirs exist only in written records.

Yet now, such an elixir had become Lin Xuan's only hope. Perhaps only this legendary, heaven-defying pill could allow an ordinary person like him—devoid of spiritual roots—to successfully reach the Foundation Establishment stage.

Once the idea took hold, Lin Xuan immediately began purifying pills to obtain a supreme-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pill.

However, this was different from his previous experiences. After reaching the Great Perfection realm, he could successfully purify high-grade pills, albeit with a low success rate—only one out of every ten attempts.

But the supreme-grade elixir...

If it had merely taken dozens of failures, Lin Xuan could have endured it. After all, a legendary pill wouldn't be easy to refine. Yet after spending over ten days and testing nearly a thousand pills, he hadn't produced a single supreme-grade elixir...

"Ah..." Lin Xuan sighed, staring at yet another ruined pill in his hand, his brow furrowed. Even with his extraordinary perseverance, his patience was nearing its limit.

Purifying a thousand pills without a single success led Lin Xuan to suspect that this wasn't merely a matter of low probability—it was likely that supreme-grade elixirs couldn't be obtained through purification at all.

But without a supreme-grade pill, he would never achieve Foundation Establishment.

Had all his efforts been in vain? Was he doomed to remain stuck at the Qi Refining stage forever? Even with his purification ability, without spiritual roots, could he never advance far on the path of immortality?

Lin Xuan felt a wave of frustration, but he quickly shook it off. There was no obstacle he couldn't overcome. He had endured countless hardships before—this was nothing.

Perhaps supreme-grade elixirs were fundamentally different from the other three grades. The thought struck him like lightning.

Thus, he began researching again. However, for modern cultivators, the supreme-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pill was too elusive. Moreover, such a heaven-defying pill wasn't even necessary in reality.

As long as one had passable spiritual roots and sufficient effort, a high-grade pill was enough to achieve Foundation Establishment. Elite disciples, relying on their innate talent, could even succeed with mid-grade or low-grade pills.

The only ones who might need a supreme-grade pill were likely ordinary people like Lin Xuan, who lacked spiritual roots.

Additionally, such pills hadn't appeared in over a thousand years. Apart from a few ancient jade slips, no other texts even mentioned them.

Lin Xuan scoured countless records but found nothing.

He even considered seeking guidance from the sect elders. However, he could only enter the Elite Hall by disguising himself as Ye Tian—and if he were truly Ye Tian, with such exceptional spiritual roots, he wouldn’t need a supreme-grade pill in the first place.

Asking questions would only draw unwanted attention and suspicion.

Left with no options, Lin Xuan was so frustrated he nearly coughed up blood.

Helpless, he could only continue taking high-grade pills for cultivation, hoping that one day, inspiration would strike and he would break through the bottleneck.

At the same time, he occasionally used the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art to pose as Ye Tian, wandering the sect and mingling with the elders, trying to subtly gather information about supreme-grade pills without arousing suspicion.

Lin Xuan was skilled at extracting information. Eventually, he managed to coax a few elders into revealing some truths—but the results only deepened his frustration. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators knew nothing about supreme-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills.

According to them, records of such things existed only in the truly prestigious sects of the cultivation world. This immediately dashed Lin Xuan's hopes. Though his current strength placed him among the top low-level disciples, those major sects were beyond his reach. After all, Yan Province was a remote borderland with a relatively backward level of cultivation. In the grand scheme of things, the Floating Cloud Valley was merely a third-rate sect.

With even the elders ignorant, Lin Xuan was close to giving up. He considered secluding himself for twenty or thirty years, relentlessly taking high-grade pills and cultivating. Hardship didn’t deter him, but he had no confidence that such efforts would guarantee Foundation Establishment.

Unlike high-level cultivators, those at the Qi Refining stage had lifespans similar to ordinary mortals. Lin Xuan simply didn’t have decades to gamble away. Moreover, as he aged, his chances of Foundation Establishment would only dwindle further.

What should he do?

Lin Xuan refused to abandon hope, but he was truly at a loss.

Despite failing to break through to Foundation Establishment, his daily cultivation had solidified his foundation. Combined with the aid of ginseng essence, the spiritual energy within him had grown even more refined.

One day, while disguised as Ye Tian on his way to listen to an elder’s lecture, Lin Xuan encountered Ma Tianxiong again. After several meetings, Lin Xuan had formed a favorable impression of this senior brother—a genuinely warm-hearted man. The two chatted casually.

Lin Xuan hadn’t intended to pry, but somehow the conversation turned to supreme-grade elixirs.

"Supreme-grade elixirs? Of course they’re completely different from other grades—even their composition varies slightly."

"You know about them?" Lin Xuan froze, then surged with joy. After searching tirelessly for days with no results, even the sect elders had been clueless. Yet here was this seemingly carefree senior brother, casually revealing the secrets of supreme-grade pills. Truly, fortune favors the persistent.
