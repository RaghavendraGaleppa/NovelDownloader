# Chapter 85: Guarantor

Upon hearing that she needed someone of significant standing to vouch for her, Chu Feifei immediately thought of the sect master's personal disciple behind Yao Shifeng. That person would undoubtedly carry enough weight.

But Yao Shifeng had already made it clear to everyone that it would be impossible to enlist the help of the sect master's personal disciple through him.

If the sect master's disciple was out of the question, Chu Feifei's mind turned to Gu Mo. However, Gu Mo was merely an outer sect disciple and clearly didn't meet the criteria of being "of significant standing."

After much deliberation, Chu Feifei realized the only person she could turn to was Ye Yuqi, who had previously extended an invitation to her.

The realization sent a chill down her spine. She sensed a deep-seated conspiracy at play, one that even involved Lan Zhishi, who stood before her.

At that moment, Chu Feifei felt her heart sink. Being targeted by a hall steward from her own peak was even more troublesome than being pursued by an inner sect disciple. With just a simple, blatant frame-up, Lan Zhishi had already backed her into a corner.

**Spiritual Field Cottage**

Gu Mo, who had been deep in cultivation, suddenly received a message talisman from Chu Feifei. Seeing it, an ominous feeling washed over him.

As expected, the contents of the message confirmed his fears. He had anticipated that someone like Ye Yuqi, given his vindictive nature, would seek revenge—though the extent had been unknown. Now, it seemed the man was intent on driving Chu Feifei to ruin.

Sabotaging the sect's protective barrier was a grave crime, punishable by expulsion at best and execution on the spot at worst.

However, after reading further into Chu Feifei's message, Gu Mo quickly revised his assessment. This wasn't an attempt to destroy her—it was coercion, meant to force her into becoming Ye Yuqi's subordinate.

What could have driven an inner sect disciple to collude with a steward from the Array Peak and frame Chu Feifei for such a serious crime? The only explanation Gu Mo could think of was that Ye Yuqi had discovered Chu Feifei's unique constitution and possessed a means to exploit it.

The scheme was nearly flawless. By leaving a loophole where Chu Feifei needed someone of standing to vouch for her, they had ensured she had no way out—what influential figure would a mere laborer disciple know?

Thankfully, Chu Feifei had heeded his advice and informed him. While Gu Mo lacked the clout to intervene, Yuan Niya, his inner sect senior sister, certainly did.

"Senior Sister Yuan!" Gu Mo took out his communication jade slip and reached out to her. Asking her to vouch for someone accused of sabotaging the sect's barrier would undoubtedly cost him the favor she owed him.

**Array Peak**

Lan Shuying gazed down at the kneeling Chu Feifei and asked coolly, "Have you found someone to vouch for you?" Her eyes flickered toward the back room, where Ye Yuqi was waiting.

All Chu Feifei had to do was speak up, and Ye Yuqi would emerge.

Chu Feifei knew this all too well—Ye Yuqi had already approached her, bluntly stating that only by submitting to him could she be saved. Otherwise, expulsion awaited her, and without the sect's protection, her fate would be far worse.

Yet Chu Feifei remained silent. Gu Mo had assured her he would handle the situation and warned her not to agree to their terms.

"My patience is wearing thin. If you persist in your stubbornness, I'll have no choice but to hand you over to the Enforcement Hall. No one will be able to save you then." Lan Shuying's irritation grew at Chu Feifei's continued silence. She couldn't fathom why this laborer disciple was still resisting.

"Senior Sister Lan, who are you planning to hand over to the Enforcement Hall?" A young woman with striking black-and-red hair strode into the room just as Lan Shuying finished speaking.

"Junior Sister Yuan! What brings you here?" Lan Shuying was startled. This was a disciple of the Enforcement Hall's elder—someone who, in many ways, represented the hall itself.

But she hadn't reported this matter to the Enforcement Hall. Why had Yuan Niya come?

"I heard this laborer disciple caused trouble. I'm here to take her in." Yuan Niya studied Chu Feifei. So this was the person Gu Mo was willing to spend one of his favors to protect.

Hmm, not as pretty as me, Yuan Niya thought, somewhat pleased as she examined Chu Feifei's face. But her gaze dropped, and her mood soured when she noticed Chu Feifei's ample bosom.

"What?" Lan Shuying was stunned. If the Enforcement Hall intervened and took Chu Feifei away, their entire plan would collapse.

Worse, if the laborer disciple blabbed under questioning, it could spell disaster. Though Lan Shuying had covered her tracks—tampering only with a non-critical section of the barrier and restoring it immediately—there was always a chance something could go wrong.

"Ahem, Junior Sister Yuan, there must be some misunderstanding. This laborer disciple only committed a minor infraction. I've already disciplined her—no need for the Enforcement Hall to step in." Lan Shuying forced a smile.

"Are you certain, Senior Sister?" Yuan Niya asked seriously.

"Absolutely!" Lan Shuying nodded.

"Then since she's already been punished and is now innocent, she can come with me." Yuan Niya turned to leave.

"Wait!" Lan Shuying hurriedly blocked her path. "Junior Sister Yuan, if she's innocent, why take her to the Enforcement Hall?"

"Who said anything about the Enforcement Hall?" Yuan Niya blinked in confusion.

"......?" Lan Shuying was utterly baffled, unable to decipher Yuan Niya's intentions.

"Junior Sister Yuan, this matter concerns me. I'd appreciate it if you'd step aside." Ye Yuqi finally emerged from the back room, realizing Yuan Niya intended to protect Chu Feifei.

Though he couldn't fathom how a mere laborer disciple had convinced an inner sect disciple like Yuan Niya to intervene, he knew his only option was to step in personally if he wanted to salvage the situation.

"What does this laborer disciple have to do with you, Senior Brother?" Yuan Niya tilted her head curiously before turning to Chu Feifei. "Do you know him?"

Chu Feifei shook her head. It was now clear that Yuan Niya was here to rescue her—and since she didn't know the woman, the only explanation was Gu Mo's involvement.

She hadn't expected Gu Mo to have connections with an inner sect disciple, let alone one who seemed influential enough to make even Ye Yuqi tread carefully.

"Senior Brother Ye, she says she doesn't know you!" Yuan Niya feigned surprise.

Her words left Ye Yuqi speechless. Some things couldn't be spoken of openly. Without Yuan Niya's interference, he could have slowly broken Chu Feifei's resistance and secured her submission.

But Yuan Niya's sudden appearance had ruined everything. 

Had it been any other inner sect disciple, Ye Yuqi might have subtly threatened them. But Yuan Niya was a disciple of the Enforcement Hall elder—someone even his own master wouldn't dare cross.

According to his master, the Enforcement Hall's "madwoman" was infamous for her temper. She had once even dared to confront the sect master. In the past, only the sect's founder could rein her in—but now that the founder had fallen, no one could restrain her.
