# Chapter 146: The Origin of the Jade Peaks and Our Flourishing Sect

The fragrance of the Earth Vein Spirit Milk rose with the steam from the Fog Flower Immortal Spring.

Any spiritual liquid or pill added to this hot spring would have its absorption efficiency greatly increased.

And it was also very comfortable.

"Hm?"

Shang Wu, who was immersed in the bath, slightly opened her almond eyes. After thinking for a moment, she said, "There used to be some."

"Used to be?"

"Used to be, on the Jade Peaks, there were dozens of jade sculptures, all of them were God Observation Diagrams."

Shang Wu lazily tugged at her bathrobe, feeling it was a bit too tight.

Li Mo suddenly understood.

No wonder the place was called the Jade Peaks; it was quite fitting.

He had been wondering why, among all the peaks of the Clear Abyss Sect, each had its own function and characteristics, yet the Jade Peaks were completely barren, with nothing there.

Wait.

It still seems barren now.

"Where did those jade sculptures go?"

Little Li speculated that it was possible the beautiful Master had no money for alcohol and sold them for drinks.

It sounded quite absurd, but coming from his Master, it seemed somewhat reasonable...

"Oh, I got really drunk one day," Shang Wu leaned her head back and recalled. "Then when I returned to the peak, I ran into those jade sculptures..."

Listening to his Master's detailed account, Little Li finally understood what had happened.

That day, Shang Wu was completely wasted, and everything probably looked blurry to her.

Then she collided with those jade sculptures.

As everyone knows, God Observation Diagrams or God Observation statues emphasize capturing both the spirit and form, being lifelike, allowing one to immerse oneself in their essence. The more realistic, the better.

And Shang Wu took it seriously.

Even Wu Song dared to fight a tiger after drinking; who was Shang Wu?

Thinking that the sect was facing a powerful enemy, she uprooted a tree and charged into battle, drunkenly beating up the "group of villains."

Only after she woke up did she realize that the God Observation statues, which had been passed down on the Jade Peaks for generations, had all been smashed to pieces.

Li Mo: "..."

Oh, I see.

So that's why the Jade Peaks are in such a dilapidated state; it turns out you demolished your own home.

He couldn't help but recall that the other peaks all had a rather strange sign erected below them.

【Drunken individuals are prohibited from entering the peak.】

He had wondered at the time what a strange rule that was.

It turned out to be tailor-made.

"Treasured disciple," Shang Wu suddenly called out to him.

Li Mo instinctively looked over, only to see his beautiful Master's almond eyes curving into crescents, her brows lightly furrowing twice.

A clear hint.

She still remembered her disciple saying that drinking while soaking in a hot spring was a wonderful thing.

"Cough, Master, from a medical perspective, drinking in a hot spring is actually bad for your health."

"My body is very well. If you don't believe me, you can fight me."

"...I forgot to bring the wine."

"A real man doesn't go back on his word."

*Splash—*

Shang Wu's pretty face scrunched up. She crossed her arms over her chest and turned her back to him.

Her disciple went back on his word and didn't listen to his Master.

Angry.

Li Mo: "..."

Generally speaking, he was a man of his word.

It was mainly because he had just heard the story about the jade sculptures.

They were bathing together right now. What if Shang Wu got drunk and confused, mistook him for a lecher peeping on her bath, and gave him a few punches?

Who could withstand that?

Seeing that her move didn't work, Shang Wu propped up her forehead and frowned.

"Tsk, I was originally going to tell my disciple how to break through the Profound Core and enter the God Observation stage."

"How did I suddenly forget what I was going to say?"

"My head hurts, I must be sick~"

The Master's three板斧 (three-pronged attack): Hinting, playing dumb, and threatening with force.

Watching his Master, who could casually uproot a weeping willow, act frail, Little Li's mouth twitched.

Sighing, Li Mo set out a floating tray with a pot of wine on it.

"Master, just this much..."

Before he could finish his words,

The tray vanished, drawn by an unseen force to Shang Wu's side.

She happily rested her elbows on the edge of the pool, propped her chin on one hand, and poured a cup.

"What wine is this? It smells quite good."

"Red Ganoderma Wine."

Li Mo watched helplessly as his Master raised the cup and downed it in one go. Her almond eyes narrowed, radiating happiness and satisfaction.

"Master, can you talk about martial arts matters now?"

"Hmph, actually, God Observation is about transforming and perfecting one's own intent soul."

Shang Wu smelled the wine in her cup, a smile playing on her lips.

"It's like aptitude. Some have a tiger's back and a bear's waist, some are born with divine strength; their physical bodies are stronger than ordinary people's."

"Observing forms and intents is a way to temper the spirit of one's intent soul."

"Similar to changing one's aptitude through post-natal training?" Li Mo恍然 (suddenly understood).

Aptitude can also be transformed through rare treasures or years of tempering.

"Yes, the two are somewhat similar," Shang Wu nodded.

She roughly explained the methods and fundamentals of tempering the spirit.

---

Li Mo now had a clear understanding.

For example, practicing the Through-the-Back Fist for years would subtly make one's posture lean towards the 'ape arm' form.

If the martial art practiced is of a higher level, the aptitude tempered will also be better.

Of course, if one's physical foundation is poor, they might injure themselves during the tempering.

God Observation is the same.

"Having a good God Observation Diagram also requires the talent to carry it."

"What suits oneself is the best."

"For example, Old Man Shangguan, he observed the form of a sparrow, which is a lower form, yet he extended it on his own into an upper form, approaching the extreme form."

Shang Wu spoke until her mouth was dry and took another sip of Red Ganoderma Wine.

"How does one find a form suitable for oneself to observe?"

Li Mo estimated that his Master was about to fall asleep and quickly asked.

"Can go... Ruyi Peak... *snore snore*..."

Shang Wu floated on the surface of the water.

"..."

She could fall asleep mid-sentence. Master, you're truly something.

By the way, a Inner Scenery Realm warrior shouldn't get waterlogged from soaking, right?

Withdrawing his gaze, Li Mo got out of the hot spring.

"Ruyi Peak... Looks like I should take a trip there tomorrow."

On the pavilion balcony.

Ying Bing watched him walk out from the rockery.

Seeing that he was in a good mood, she couldn't help but feel a bit curious.

Is soaking in a hot spring really that comfortable?

On second thought.

If the punishment for the loser is practically non-existent, then why should she deliberately avoid it?

"I'll think about it when I have time," Ying Bing shook her head slightly.

She had to enter the main peak's ancestral hall tomorrow. What she needed to do now was adjust her condition to its peak.

Based on her experience from her previous life and the subtle hints leaked by Shangguan Wencang, she already knew.

There is a high probability that the main peak's ancestral hall contains the Divine Form of the Great Dao.

"The Divine Form of the Great Yin plus the Divine Form of the Phoenix."

"My God Observation Realm will be much stronger than in my previous life."

Ying Bing knelt under the moonlight, bathed in its pure brilliance, like the most exquisite jade sculpture in the world. The Profound Core within her slowly rotated, seemingly establishing a connection with the moon in the sky.

...

The next day.

The sky was overcast, looking as dark as if it were about to turn night in the early morning. The three suns were nowhere to be seen.

The dark clouds were thick, as if brewing a torrential rain.

On the bluestone paths of the sect, a young man in a white robe moved lightly, his face handsome and gentle. If someone said he was a gentleman from Ruyi Peak studying the classics of the sages, probably no one would object.

Well... Ouyang might object.

After asking for directions, Li Mo didn't take long to find a house nestled among the bamboo groves.

To his surprise, Ouyang's courtyard was bustling with activity.

Disciples from various peaks were there, forming a long queue.

He even spotted a familiar figure.

"Brother Li, are you also here to buy Brother Ouyang's work?"

Murong Xiao saw the newcomer and smiled broadly. The smile was a bit silly, giving off an air of someone wise in their simplicity.

"Something like that," Li Mo nodded.

Painting is one of Ruyi Peak's proudest skills, holding a position similar to forging on the Divine Weapon Peak and alchemy on the Cauldron Peak.

True masters of painting can replicate God Observation Diagrams with incredible fidelity.

Everyone hopes for high-quality pills and weapons, and the same goes for God Observation Diagrams.

A good God Observation Diagram is worth a fortune.

However, he wasn't here to buy paintings, after all, he didn't even know what form was suitable for him to observe.

"So many people," Murong Xiao looked into the distance.

"Yeah, it seems we won't be seeing Brother Ouyang for a while," Li Mo couldn't help but sigh.

Our Clear Abyss Sect is truly flourishing.

So many fellow disciples are so diligent and eager to learn, striving to advance towards the God Observation Realm.

"Are you two true disciples here to buy paintings too?"

At this moment, an inner sect disciple suddenly approached them.

He said mysteriously, "This junior is not very talented, but I lined up early and have obtained Brother Ouyang's latest work. I wonder if you two Senior Brothers are interested? The price, of course, is a little... higher."

"Since this junior has lined up for so long, I'd like to earn a little辛苦费 (hardship fee)."

"Hm?"

Li Mo was puzzled.

The way he spoke sounded like a scalper.

But God Observation Diagrams aren't通用 (universal), so what's the point of being a scalper?

"Senior Brothers, it's absolutely lifelike! You know Brother Ouyang's skill level."

The inner sect disciple enticed them.

"Uh, give it to me," Li Mo didn't care about the small amount of money and paid up readily. The inner sect disciple beamed with joy and handed over a picture album.

Seeing the cover, Little Li felt a sense of foreboding.

He flipped it open, and sure enough.

His mouth twitched.

Oh, so *that's* what you mean by lifelike?

"So everyone lines up early in the morning to buy *this* kind of 'classic'?"

*Slam—*

Little Li angrily threw the picture album to the ground.
