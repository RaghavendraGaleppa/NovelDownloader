# Chapter 220: I Still Prefer This One More

Seeing everyone’s lack of interest, Li Mo cleared his throat toward the big-headed doll and spoke loudly:

“Ahem, since this is an awards ceremony, there naturally must be prizes. For instance, profound crystals?”

As soon as these words were spoken, Qian Bufan stopped in his tracks. One could only say that he truly was an Inner Scenery expert; he executed a sudden stop and a 180-degree turn to sit back down without any sense of违和感.

“Of course, that includes but is not limited to excellent sets of the Four Treasures of the Study...”

Ouyang reversed his car into the garage: “It’s our first awards ceremony; I must do my part to support it.”

“Rare ingredients for alchemy, heavenly treasures and earthly gems...”

Xue Jing slapped his thigh—very quickly—and casually picked up the tea leaves placed beside him.

“Oh, there’s quite a bit of aged wine from twenty or thirty years ago too.”

Shang Wu sat up straight, instantly no longer sleepy: “Dear disciple, do you need an award presenter? How about I give it a shot?”

Her movements were so fast that even Xue Jing couldn't help but look puzzled: “Weren't you asleep?”

“You’re one to talk; weren't you going to refine pills?” Shang Wu turned her head and snorted.

Xue Jing fell silent for a moment before saying, “...I suddenly remembered that refining that pill requires the right timing, location, and conditions. The auspicious time hasn't arrived yet.”

Shang Wu looked at Qian Bufan.

Qian Bufan was adept at social maneuvering; he raised the teapot in his hand: “I saw that the tea was gone just now and was thinking of adding some more.”

Shen Yunfei: “I saw the table was dirty, so I’m wiping it.”

Ouyang: “The floor is dirty; I’m sweeping it with a broom.”

Everyone found something to do.

“Huh?”

Xu Yi, who had just returned from the restroom, was dumbfounded.

Xu Xiao’er felt he was facing a massive unemployment crisis.

Thus.

Under the earnest persuasion of Little Li Mo, the Qingyuan Sect’s First Golden Statue Awards for Best Actor officially began!

As the host of the awards ceremony, Little Li Mo wore a meticulously polite smile:

“First, Best Actor!”

He started with a bubbly voice right off the bat.

Starting with something so heavy right away?

It made everyone feel it was quite grand and exciting; they all sat up straight.

“He, within the Black Building, relying on a wonderful performance, made a stunning entrance that successfully intimidated everyone.”

“Ladies and gentlemen, his acting skills are there for all to see; on the scene, he fully displayed composure in the face of danger and an air of absolute confidence, playing a decisive role in the entire scene!”

“Moreover, not only is his aura strong, but he is also very handsome.”

Li Mo paused here.

Theoretically, there should be an advertisement inserted here.

But he didn't know what advertisement to play.

So he could only look at everyone with a mysterious smile.

“Ah, is there any controversy here?” Qian Bufan shook his head.

Xue Jing nodded and smiled: “Indeed, there’s nothing to guess; the Best Actor is naturally...”

The two exchanged a glance and said in unison:

“Me.” x2

The word was the same, but the people were not.

“Hehe, Old Xue, you’re so ordinary; why are you so confident?”

“Old Qian, not to say anything, but your width and length are the same, like a ball; how do you have the face to say that?”

“Do you understand what ‘chubby but top-tier’ means? Got a problem? Let’s duel!”

“Scared of you?!”

Xue Jing and Elder Qian released their aura, faintly showing signs of a confrontation.

Just as they were about to fight.

Little Host Li’s announcement finally drifted down from above:

“After strict voting and selection.”

“The Best Actor is... me.”

The two elders who were about to grab each other’s necks, along with everyone else, looked over simultaneously to see Little Li Mo pointing at himself.

Huh?

Wait.

Xue Jing: “Little Mo, aren't you the host? How can you give an award to yourself?”

Qian Bufan: “This is rigged! How was the voting done?!”

---

But Li Mo had a reason that left everyone speechless and forced to agree.

“I am the sole sponsor of this ceremony.”

“......”

The two elders sat down.

Why didn't you say so earlier?

Thus, Shang Wu personally presented the pure gold statuette, which was made by Li Mo using Eight Treasure Devouring Gold Pills to absorb the energy of gold and stone, making it shine brilliantly.

The image of the statuette was not just similar to the big-headed doll used as a microphone; it was exactly the same.

“It’s the shiny... shiny Little Li Big Brother...”

Princess Jiang blinked, nervously clutching the hem of her skirt.

But then she remembered that she hadn't gone to the Drizzle Building.

The award shouldn't be for her...

She turned her head and found Sister Bing also looking at that little figure.

Ying Bing was feeling a bit strange now.

She found that she was gradually becoming interested in this awards ceremony.

The image of him calling out her name and her going up to receive the award even popped into her mind...

It was even more anticipated than seeing her name appear on the Hidden Dragon List.

Even though it was such a boring thing...

Soon, Best Supporting Actor Elder Qian, Best Cinematography Ouyang, and all sorts of miscellaneous awards were handed out.

“Now, for tonight’s grand finale award, ah, familiar viewers should know.”

“That’s right, it’s Best Actress!”

As soon as Host Li finished speaking.

Xu Yi and Senior Brother Xiao Bao, who had somehow made it to the second floor, raised the night pearls in their hands. Using polished lenses to amplify the light, they created a spotlight effect.

Best Actress...

Only two women had gone that day.

One was our beautiful Master, and the other was the Ice Cube.

So the spotlight shuttled back and forth between the two. The hearts of everyone present were pulled taut, and they all grew tense.

At this moment, Li Mo walked down and handed the statuette to Shang Wu.

“The Best Actress is, Shang Wu...”

“Yay!”

Shang Wu had already started cheering.

Ying Bing’s delicate brows slightly furrowed.

“...alongside Ying Bing.”

Shang Wu’s smile froze at the corner of her mouth.

“Old Lady isn’t convinced! My performance that day was witnessed by everyone. If I hadn’t led the way, how could so many assassins have taken the job?”

Shang Wu slapped the table and protested to the organizers.

Li Mo cleared his throat softly: “Master, that wasn't acting.”

“What was it then?”

“Releasing your true nature.”

Everyone nodded in agreement; Shang Wu truly had no element of acting in it.

The beautiful Master was speechless; she pouted and glared at her precious disciple with her apricot eyes, very angry.

The latter stated that there was also a Best Participation Award, the prize being fine wine, so Shang Wu finally let it go.

Li Mo grinned: “Surprised? Unexpected?”

“Give it to me.”

Ying Bing’s eyes flashed with a hint of satisfaction as she reached out her slender hand.

“Here.”

The statuette was placed in her hand. Ying Bing lowered her eyes and looked at it for a few seconds.

It was heavy and cool.

There were many awards; basically, everyone present had one.

She paused, then reached out her hand again.

“Hmm?”

Little Li Mo, who had just sat down, looked puzzled.

“The Best Actress only gets one trophy.”

“It’s not the trophy.”

Ying Bing gently picked up the big-headed doll beside him.

It seemed to carry a lingering warmth that hadn't yet dissipated.

“I still prefer this one more.”
