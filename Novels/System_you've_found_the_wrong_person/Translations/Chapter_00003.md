# Chapter 3: Misfortune Strikes  

An arrow tore through the sky—swift, precise, and ruthless.  

Beneath his bamboo hat, Dou Changsheng's eyes were filled with intense focus, not daring to relax for even a moment. His heart pounded in his throat.  

Since transmigrating to this world, he had faced many dangers, stumbling and crawling his way through, no longer the pampered young man he once was. But none had been as perilous as today.  

His next move was to cut the arrow mid-flight with his sword. If he missed, and if the Ironclad Lion King Wang Xiong turned back to strike, Dou Changsheng knew he would be dead for sure.  

His future self—twenty years old, a prodigy on the Human Ranking—possessed profound innate qi, surging like a mighty river. In contrast, he only had one month's worth of cultivation. If he had mastered swordsmanship, footwork, and combat experience, he might have stood a chance.  

After all, Wang Xiong, despite being formidable—skilled in archery and horsemanship, with a body as tough as steel—was still just a Houtian realm martial artist.  

His future self, a prodigy of the Human Ranking, even with just one month's cultivation, was equivalent to ten times that of an ordinary person—several years' worth of cultivation. Moreover, the purity and quality of innate qi far surpassed that of Houtian qi, making him exceptionally powerful.  

But the problem was, Dou Changsheng was all bark and no bite.  

His meager combat skills could barely be called street fighting techniques—no match for Wang Xiong.  

Focusing intently on the incoming arrow, Dou Changsheng slowly raised his rusted sword and channeled his innate qi, intending to slice the arrow in half. But to his surprise, the moment his qi made contact with the arrow, the projectile disintegrated into nothingness, vanishing into the air.  

The sheer power of innate qi was undeniable.  

Relief washed over Dou Changsheng as his heart settled back into place.  

With a light chuckle, he said, "Tell me—is this innate qi real or fake?"  

Wang Xiong, who had lunged forward and was mere inches from grabbing his bow, suddenly retracted his arm. With a powerful kick, he sent dust flying into the air as he darted toward a distant alley like a leopard.  

Even though retrieving his bow would have taken only a moment, Wang Xiong didn't dare risk it.  

The arrow, though wooden, had a specially crafted tip made of refined iron mixed with gold, designed to pierce armor. To ensure success, Wang Xiong had spent his entire fortune on this special bow and armor-piercing arrows.  

Yet, they had been effortlessly shattered by innate qi.  

This was undoubtedly the power of a Xiantian realm expert.  

Wang Xiong, ever cautious, dashed into the alley and immediately lifted a stone slab, revealing a dark, narrow tunnel. Without hesitation, he plunged inside.  

---  

Dou Changsheng watched as the dust settled, leaving no trace of Wang Xiong. His gaze swept the empty streets—not a living soul remained.  

Such martial conflicts were neither rare nor common in the jianghu.  

It was simply the way of the world. No one dared to gather and watch openly, lest they become collateral damage when tempers flared.  

But while they wouldn't watch openly, they would peek through cracks in windows or hide in alleys. Dou Changsheng knew this well—before today, he had done the same whenever martial artists clashed.  

Without hesitation, he turned and headed toward the county office, slowly sheathing his three-foot-long sword.  

Innate qi was even more formidable than he had imagined.  

This confirmed that it wasn't ordinary innate qi—his future self must have cultivated a high-tier technique.  

What he lacked now was proper cultivation methods—no, more accurately, a reliable mentor to guide him into true martial practice.  

A trace of resentment rose in his heart. His first benefactor, the Black Eagle Venerable, had failed him at the critical moment, allowing Wang Xiong to expose him. Otherwise, this would have been the perfect opportunity to emulate his future self.  

With a sigh, Dou Changsheng could only blame his rotten luck—being framed by Wang Xiong had set off a chain reaction, altering events.  

But deep down, he suspected this wasn't just bad luck.  

Perhaps his "script" was simply harder than others'.  

Just look at Wang Xiong—cunning, ruthless, and highly skilled. He was no mere cannon fodder who would die in a simple robbery.  

Yet, in his future self's timeline, Wang Xiong had been nothing more than a minor character who died instantly.  

Dou Changsheng took a deep breath, exhaling slowly to steady his turbulent emotions.  

Before he could reach the county office, a group of constables surrounded him, accompanied by Golden Plume Guards wielding swords. They formed multiple layers, blocking the streets completely.  

Clearly, the local authorities had received word and mobilized immediately.  

Dou Changsheng untied the bundle on his back and raised it high. "This is the military payroll for the border troops," he declared. "It was stolen by the Ironclad Lion King Wang Xiong, but I've reclaimed it. I was on my way to the county office to return it to the court."  

"I haven't opened the bundle—everything inside remains untouched. Now that I've met you all, I can return it intact."  

---  

Slowly lowering his arm, Dou Changsheng extended the bundle forward. A constable and a Golden Plume Guard stepped up simultaneously. After exchanging glances, the constable retreated, allowing the guard to take the bundle.  

Instead of inspecting it immediately, the guard stepped back and handed it to a man in silver armor.  

The silver-armored man snatched the bundle and tore it open, revealing a cascade of gemstones the size of fingernails.  

The gems were blood-red, exuding an eerie, sinister glow.  

With a flick of his wrist, the silver-armored man summoned swirling mist-like qi, lifting the gems into the air. Under the mist's embrace, the gems resembled crimson stars—beautiful, dazzling, and imperious.  

"Pure Yang Blood Gems," the man muttered. "So the General's Office is truly desperate—even a Pure Yang Grandmaster has sacrificed himself to provide for the border troops."  

"That treacherous chancellor has doomed the nation!"  

"Disgraceful!"  

His furious roar echoed through the silent streets. No one dared to refute him; instead, anger simmered in every face.  

Turning to Dou Changsheng, the silver-armored man clasped his fists. "Hero, thank you for returning the military payroll. However, I must depart immediately for Sword Gate Pass to deliver it personally. I cannot entertain you properly—please forgive my rudeness."  

Dou Changsheng quickly replied, "The border troops' affairs affect the entire nation. My personal matters are trivial. Just provide me with a fast horse, and I'll be on my way."  

Wang Xiong was dangerous, but if Dou Changsheng rode fast enough, he could leave this mess behind.  

The silver-armored man waved his hand. "As you wish. Fetch the hero a swift horse!"  

Before the order could be carried out, a distant voice called out, "Wait!"  

Dou Changsheng turned to see an elderly man striding through the air toward them. Dressed in black robes that fluttered in the wind, the man had piercing eagle-like eyes, a high nose bridge, and a long white beard.  

His sharp gaze locked onto the silver-armored man. "Ling Qianxu!" he growled. "I don't trust you."  

"Though you hail from the north, you once served in the capital's Golden Plume Guards. Wang Xiong knew exactly when and where to strike—someone leaked the information. At the critical moment, someone interfered, causing the General's Office's escort to fall."  

"If the payroll doesn't reach Sword Gate Pass in time to calm the troops, the garrison commander will open the gates to the barbarians."  

"And if those savages enter, the land will drown in blood."  

"But that treacherous chancellor, for his own gain, has framed the Grand General!"  

Ling Qianxu roared in fury, "Black Eagle Venerable, you dare suspect me?"  

"I was born in the north—my family, my friends, all are here! If the barbarians invade, my kin will perish!"  

"Do you think I'm so deranged that I'd sacrifice my own people for power?"  

"Since the Grand General was entrusted by the late emperor to guard the north, peace has reigned for over a decade. Every northerner reveres him!"  

Ignoring Ling Qianxu, the Black Eagle Venerable turned to Dou Changsheng. "Young hero, I must trouble you once more. Escort the payroll to Sword Gate Pass."  

"With the Grand General imprisoned, the General's Office is in chaos. We lack trustworthy hands."  

"I can't rely on these people—only a noble disciple like you."  

"Most may betray us for the chancellor, but the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou never would."  

"The Wang Clan is renowned across the land for loyalty, courage, and love. To put it bluntly, even if you had ill intentions, your family's honor would compel you to keep your word."  

Dou Changsheng shook his head. "My name is Dou Changsheng. I have no ties to the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou. You've mistaken me for someone else."  

This "Wang Clan of Xiangzhou" was likely the same prestigious family from his friend's "easy mode" timeline.  

His friend had merely shown courage fighting ghosts and earned the Wang Clan's favor, even marrying their eldest daughter. It sounded absurd—shouldn't such a daughter have been betrothed long ago?  

The Black Eagle Venerable was taken aback. He prided himself on his sharp eyes—hence his moniker.  

But that innate qi—he had seen it many times in Xiangzhou. It was unmistakably the Three Origins Returning Qi Art, the Wang Clan's signature technique.  

A youth who could reach the Xiantian realm at this age had to be from a great clan. A rogue cultivator? Impossible.  

Some truths couldn't be denied, even if one refused to admit them.  

The Black Eagle Venerable quickly pieced it together—this was a Wang Clan core disciple, sent to aid the Grand General incognito.  

The Grand General's wrongful imprisonment had shocked not just the Great Jin but also neighboring nations.  

The Wang Clan couldn't openly send elders to defy the court, so they dispatched a core disciple under a false name.  

Touched, the Black Eagle Venerable's eyes moistened. Since the Grand General's fall, few had stood by him.  

For the Wang Clan to send their future pillar—a prodigy who might reach the Human Ranking—showed their unwavering support.  

Suppressing his emotions, the Black Eagle Venerable softened his tone. "Ah, my mistake. But young hero, will you consider my request?"  

Dou Changsheng shook his head firmly. "I'm unskilled in swordsmanship and martial arts. My innate qi is passable, but I'd only slow you down. Please find someone more capable."  

Was this a joke?  

He was a half-baked amateur trying to escape this storm, not dive into it.  

This was a clash between the barbarians and the Great Jin, a power struggle involving the Grand General's 200,000 elite northern troops.  

The new emperor hadn't slept soundly since ascending the throne.  

Rumors swirled that the General's Office might rebel, ally with the barbarians, and march south with 500,000 troops.  

At that point, figures ten—no, a hundred—times more dangerous than Wang Xiong would emerge.  

Dou Changsheng's refusal only made the Black Eagle Venerable smile wider.  

This was exactly what he expected.  

The Grand General's arrest had happened too quickly. This Wang Clan disciple—no, Dou Changsheng—had only mastered the Three Origins Returning Qi Art. Its distinct traits were impossible to hide.  

But swordsmanship and martial arts? Those could be concealed.  

Otherwise, if he used Wang Clan techniques alongside their signature qi art, who would believe he wasn't one of them?  

The Black Eagle Venerable said warmly, "I may be untalented, but in my decades with the General's Office, I've studied many techniques."
