# Chapter 47: Arrival Like Thunder

"I originally thought that the Three Immortal Swords could handle the Marrow Refining Realm, but it seems I was a bit optimistic," Chen Fei muttered to himself. Without actual combat experience, judging purely by observation often led to significant discrepancies. Jian Liang and Zhang Xianping were both in the Bone Forging Realm, yet their combat prowess differed greatly. Never underestimate your enemy, or you might not even see people again in the future, because you'd already be dead.

He looked at the messy courtyard and the corpses on the ground. His plans were somewhat disrupted. When the Zhao family arrived tomorrow, Chen Fei didn't know how he would explain it. Three people dying together? That would be hard to believe, as the neck wounds of the two guards were too clean. It was clear they had no chance to resist and were killed instantly.

"It seems my current identity is no longer usable." Chen Fei sighed softly, briefly dealt with the three bodies, and threw them into a desolate, uninhabited courtyard. Zhang Xianping had some silver on him, but no secret manual as Chen Fei had hoped. Zhang Xianping's legacy was clearly extraordinary, but unfortunately, it didn't offer Chen Fei any cultivation techniques.

Chen Fei returned indoors, packed all his essential belongings into a wooden cabinet, then placed the cabinet into his spatial grid. He then changed his appearance and came to the dark market.

"I was just looking for you. Three days from now, at Chen Shi (7-9 AM), gather at Wind-Stirring Stone. We won't wait, so don't be late."

He didn't charge the silver to his system panel because he would need the physical currency three days later, and once charged, it couldn't be withdrawn. Chen Fei didn't linger in the dark market. He turned and left. As soon as he stepped out of the shop, a feeling of being tracked and monitored arose in his heart.

Chen Fei frowned slightly. This wasn't like a casual tail; the hostility was strong, even carrying killing intent. Chen Fei glanced, seeing someone subtly watching him. He recalled the seemingly casual words the vendor had spoken inside the shop earlier, and his heart stirred.

Without a word, Chen Fei casually wandered through the dark market. After taking a few detours, when he reappeared, he had already changed his face and attire. The monitoring gazes immediately vanished. Chen Fei circled the dark market two more times before finally leaving.

Several hundred meters away.

"Boss, we lost him!"

"Idiots! Didn't I tell you to be careful?!" Ling Han Army kicked a subordinate to the ground. In the dark market, Ling Han Army had been detaining anyone he deemed suspicious for the past few days. Although the probability was low for this person today, given the significant difference in movement techniques, his disguise skill was so high that Ling Han Army would rather kill the wrong person than let him go.

"Ah..." Screams echoed incessantly. Ling Han Army's forehead veins bulged with anger. Before they had even covered half the distance, more than half of his subordinates were already dead. These were all his original followers, who had joined the rebel army with him. This meant that if these people all died, it wouldn't be so easy for Ling Han Army to act so imperiously anymore.

"Stop!" Ling Han Army roared, and then himself continued to pounce towards Chen Fei.

Chen Fei mechanically drew his bow and fired arrows. When the quiver on his back emptied, a new batch of arrows would instantly appear, and Chen Fei's hands never ceased their action. The rebel soldiers stopped in their tracks, guarding each other. Chen Fei's arrows became less threatening. At most, they could inflict some damage, but he couldn't achieve instant kills as before. Chen Fei's gaze shifted, watching Ling Han Army getting closer and closer, and then he threw his bow and arrow at Ling Han Army.
