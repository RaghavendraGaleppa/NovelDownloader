# Chapter 44: Black Jade Spirit Snake and Black Jade Restoration Pill

At the entrance of his cave abode, Qi Chuan examined the handwriting on the paper crane message in his hand, a trace of surprise flashing in his eyes.

"I never expected Murong Fan to have stumbled upon a treasure map and invited me to explore it with him..."

So-called treasure maps were simply records of one or several hidden treasure locations. These sites usually contained valuables or resources left behind by individuals or factions. Finding such a place could yield substantial rewards if one was fortunate.

In the world of cultivation, anything that could pique the interest of Murong Fan—a proud scion of a cultivation family—would naturally be extraordinary. At the very least, the treasure site would contain valuable cultivation resources.

However, being a treasure map, it would inevitably be filled with riddles and mysteries to obscure the true location. Only by deciphering these clues could one find the correct path to the treasure.

"The letter says Murong Fan has already verified the map's authenticity," Qi Chuan mused. "That means he's solved its riddles, located the treasure site, and possibly even visited it himself—only to find he couldn't enter."

Since Qi Chuan had agreed to establish a tentative connection with Murong Fan over a year ago, the latter had frequently shared insider information with him, fostering a mutual exchange. Occasionally, Murong Fan would also invite him to undertake inner sect missions together. Qi Chuan had declined most of these offers but accepted a select few.

His reasons for agreeing were multifaceted. Firstly, Qi Chuan needed resources to cultivate his Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body and to exchange for Spirit Gathering Pills to aid his cultivation. Over the past year, he had occasionally taken on inner sect missions from the Moonlit Breeze Sect to earn these resources. Some were rare and rewarding sect tasks, while others were relatively safe external assignments. Murong Fan's invitations simply provided an additional channel for such opportunities.

Secondly, Qi Chuan's willingness to collaborate stemmed from his confidence in his own strength. Both he and Murong Fan were at the fourth level of Qi Refinement, but Qi Chuan had mastered all five basic elemental spells—particularly his Fireball Technique, which had reached the Great Accomplishment stage and even progressed further within it. A single Great Accomplishment-level Fireball Technique was formidable even among late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, let alone all five.

If Murong Fan harbored any ill intentions, Qi Chuan was confident he could overpower and kill him. And if push came to shove, there was always the talisman treasure inscribed with a black giant ruler—a weapon whose terrifying power Qi Chuan had tested in seclusion. The results had left him awestruck. 

Most talisman treasures could only replicate up to 30% of their original magical artifact's power, with weaker ones barely reaching 10%. Yet Qi Chuan's talisman treasure seemed to possess the full 30%—and its original artifact was no ordinary treasure, given its overwhelming might. Even among Foundation Establishment cultivators, this talisman would be considered a divine protective artifact.

With such a weapon at his disposal, Qi Chuan was certain that any treachery from Murong Fan would be met with instant annihilation—unless the latter somehow enlisted the help of the Murong family's sole Foundation Establishment elder, Old Ancestor Murong. But the likelihood of that was negligible.

Thus, Qi Chuan had cautiously accepted a couple of missions with Murong Fan, both of which proceeded smoothly and yielded decent rewards, earning a sliver of his trust. The resources gained from these collaborations, combined with his own efforts, had allowed Qi Chuan to advance his Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body to the peak of its first layer and break through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement.

"As for this treasure map, I'll hear the details first," Qi Chuan thought. "If the risks are manageable, I might consider it. Otherwise, I'll pass."

The decision was his to make. With that in mind, he left his cave abode and headed northeast to Murong Fan's mid-grade first-tier cave.

Soon, Qi Chuan arrived at the mountainside where Murong Fan's cave was located. Outside the entrance stood a plainly dressed young man with an unremarkable face, waiting patiently with clasped hands—Murong Fan himself.

"Brother Qi!" Murong Fan greeted him warmly as he approached.

"Brother Murong," Qi Chuan returned the gesture. "First, tell me about the treasure map. Then I'll decide whether to join you."

Murong Fan nodded, understanding Qi Chuan's caution. "This isn't the place to discuss it. Please, come inside."

They entered the cave and sat at a stone table. Murong Fan brewed some spiritual tea and poured two cups, taking a sip from his own. Qi Chuan toyed with his cup but didn't drink.

Unfazed, Murong Fan set his cup down and began explaining: "I've verified the treasure map's authenticity. The site is located in Black Snake City, dozens of miles from the sect. Outside the city lies the Black Snake Abyss—a labyrinthine network of winding tunnels and caves, shrouded in darkness and infested with first-tier demonic beasts known as Black Jade Spirit Snakes, ranging from low to mid-tier in strength."

"The treasure lies beyond two mid-tier Black Jade Spirit Snakes. I can handle one alone, which is why I sought your aid."

Murong Fan disclosed most details, withholding only the exact location—after all, revealing that would render the map unnecessary for Qi Chuan.

Qi Chuan nodded at his transparency; without it, he wouldn't have collaborated before. "Black Snake Abyss, just dozens of miles away?" he echoed, surprised.

Such proximity was unusual. The Moonlit Breeze Sect's territory was vast, and within a hundred miles, their dominance was absolute—rarely did any disturbances occur. Even outer sect disciples seldom encountered danger in this radius.

Moreover, Qi Chuan recalled hearing about Black Jade Spirit Snakes back in Red Maple Valley. His second uncle had once mentioned that their gallbladders were highly valuable, capable of refining Black Jade Restoration Pills—a medicine that could repair damaged meridians in cultivators.

His second uncle, forever stuck at the third level of Qi Refinement, had suffered minor meridian damage in his youth, compounding his poor ninth-grade spiritual root's limitations. Two years prior, he'd lamented that a single mid-tier Black Jade Spirit Snake's gallbladder could have cured him—if only he'd had the strength to obtain one or the means to refine it into a pill. Purchasing the pill outright was beyond his reach, both financially and socially.
