# Chapter 38: Talisman Crafting Manual and Seven-Star Spirit Fruit

Chu Ning sat down with Qiu Shunyi and others in the vacant seats, while cultivators continued to arrive in the hall. Later, Chu Ning noticed more advanced cultivators arriving one after another, all being ushered upstairs.

Looking up, Chu Ning saw a row of small rooms encircling the second floor. These rooms faced the front of the hall with only a thin, transparent veil, yet he couldn't see anything inside. Clearly, these rooms were protected by some kind of restriction. The real participants of this auction were those seated above.

After a while, a beautiful and graceful woman in a brocade robe stepped onto the circular platform at the front of the hall.

"Fellow Daoists, welcome to the Yunhai Pavilion auction. I am Sikong Lan, the host of today's event. The auction is about to begin, and I hope for your generous support."

Though her voice wasn't loud, Chu Ning felt as if she were speaking right beside him, her words crisp and clear—a testament to her profound cultivation. Others seemed to realize this as well, and the previously noisy hall quickly fell silent.

Sikong Lan smiled charmingly at the audience and waved her hand, revealing a long brocade box on the table.

"The first item of today's auction is a set of Golden Feather Swords—a high-grade metal-attribute magical artifact. Besides being a high-grade artifact, this set includes both a mother and child sword, which can significantly enhance its power when used skillfully. The starting bid is 400 low-grade spirit stones, with increments of at least 30 stones."

Chu Ning and other first-time attendees couldn't help but gasp inwardly. The first artifact already had a starting price of 400 spirit stones—far beyond the means of low-level disciples like them.

"450 spirit stones!"

As soon as Sikong Lan finished speaking, a voice rang out from one of the small rooms on the second floor. Though the words were clear, the voice itself sounded ethereal, leaving Chu Ning puzzled.

"480 spirit stones!"

Another voice followed, equally indistinct. Realizing that the restrictions in the rooms also altered the voices, Chu Ning thought to himself, "The Yunhai Pavilion takes privacy seriously." He decided that if he ever had enough spirit stones to buy treasures, he would consider attending their auctions.

After several rounds of bidding, the metal-attribute artifact set was sold for 700 spirit stones.

"700 spirit stones..."

Chu Ning calculated in his mind and sighed. Among the new disciples—even in the entire Ding District—he was one of the top earners due to his Yin Wood Spirit Body's enhancement of wood-attribute spells and his Fu Source Spirit Body's effectiveness in talisman paper production. Yet, he currently only had 52 spirit stones and 5,250 sheets of talisman paper. Of these, 1,000 sheets were meant for Mu Ling, leaving him with 4,250 to sell. Even if he sold them all to Mu Ling for 85 spirit stones, his total would only be 135—his entire quarterly income.

Planting spirit rice in medium-grade spirit fields yielded two harvests a year, with an additional season for Purple Vine Grass, but the income was limited. Ink Bamboo could only be harvested twice a year. At this rate, his annual income from farming would barely reach 300 spirit stones. And now, a single artifact set cost more than two years of his earnings. For disciples like Qiu Shunyi, accumulating such wealth would take even longer.

"It's incredibly difficult for low-level disciples to rise above their station," Chu Ning mused. But then he reminded himself that high-grade artifacts were typically meant for Foundation Establishment cultivators.

The auction continued. The second item was a rare spirit herb with a starting price of 300 spirit stones. Though valuable, it wasn't as sought-after as the artifact. Rare herbs like this were usually more effective when refined into pills, so bidding wasn't as fierce. Eventually, it was sold for 500 spirit stones.

Sikong Lan then presented several more items—pills, artifacts, herbs, and spell manuals—covering a wide range. However, none exceeded 1,000 spirit stones, giving Chu Ning a rough idea of the auction's scale. Clearly, items worth over 1,000 spirit stones were likely reserved for more exclusive auctions.

"The next item is slightly more precious—a manual on talisman crafting. This manual primarily covers three types of low-grade primary talismans but also includes one offensive and one defensive mid-grade primary talisman. The starting bid is 600 spirit stones, with increments of at least 50."

Chu Ning's heart raced at the mention of a talisman crafting manual. After learning talisman paper production, this was his next goal. While the sect didn't offer it to miscellaneous disciples, here it was in the market. But his excitement quickly faded when he heard the price.

600 spirit stones—he couldn't afford that even if he sold everything he had. And this was just the starting bid; the final price would be higher. As expected, cultivators on the second floor began bidding, and the manual's price soared to 1,000 spirit stones—the first item to reach that milestone.

It made sense. Among the four arts of alchemy, talismans, artifacts, and formations, talisman crafting was relatively easier to master. Once learned, it could be a steady source of income. The inclusion of two mid-grade primary talisman methods further increased its value. Only a few bidders participated, likely those who had some experience in talisman crafting and knew if it suited them. If it were universally applicable, the price would have been even higher.

Shaking his head, Chu Ning lamented his missed opportunity and turned his attention back to the stage. Sikong Lan was now holding a small transparent cover with a jade box inside. As she opened it with a spell, the contents were revealed.

Chu Ning's expression froze in shock.

"The next auction item is the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit..." Sikong Lan announced.
