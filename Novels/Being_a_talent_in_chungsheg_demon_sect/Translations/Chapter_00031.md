**Chapter 31: A Single Sword Strike Cleaves the Sky**

Not long ago, at Butian Peak, inside a peak-top cave dwelling.

In stark contrast to the hustle and bustle, the myriad human affairs on Butian Peak, the peak's summit was a place of only rising and falling clouds, transcendent and detached, as if it had escaped this tumultuous mortal world.

Before a cliff, two figures gazed down at the sea of clouds below.

One had a youthful face and crane-white hair, clad in a black and white Daoist robe, a horsetail whisk held in his hand. He resembled the benevolent old immortals often depicted in mortal folk tales.

The other was a middle-aged man, who spoke with a playful smirk, "Butian, I hear you've been choosing a son-in-law for your daughter recently?"

"Oh? Are you interested?" The Butian Peak Master turned to the middle-aged man. "If it's one of your disciples, that would indeed be a good match for Qian'er."

"I'd rather not."

The middle-aged man shook his head. "I know my disciples; they're all silver-plated lead spearheads, they couldn't handle your daughter. It's best to seek out a more capable person."

"Then so be it," the Butian Peak Master shook his head. "In any case, I've already set my sights on someone. This individual has cultivated diligently for three lifetimes, with an excellent foundation in both merit and background. In the future, there's a thirty percent chance he'll forge a Dao Foundation. What's more, after learning True Immortal Panlong's 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art,' he also possesses the might of a true dragon..."

"True Immortal Panlong? That doesn't sound right."

Hearing this, the middle-aged man calculated with his fingers for a moment, then shook his head. "Panlong Island vanished without a trace, and the fortuitous encounter has already been obtained by someone else, not your disciple."

"It will be soon."

The Butian Peak Master said faintly, "I've already divined who forcibly seized the opportunity. I've sent Yuanchun to handle it, and it won't be long before it returns to the right track."

"Tsk, tsk, tsk, you really don't give anyone a chance to live." The middle-aged man shook his head upon hearing this. "The immortal path is hard to attain, why be so harsh on some juniors?"

"Sometimes, you still need to give them a little hope. After all, the Sacred Sect also needs fresh blood."

"You don't need to teach me."

The Butian Peak Master sneered. "If it were merely that, I might not have acted. But I've divined that the person who took True Immortal Panlong's fortuitous encounter is quite extraordinary."

Speaking to this point, the Butian Peak Master's tone held a hint of surprise. "This person joined the sect only a few years ago. Not only did he make a fortune during the Spirit Puppet Substitute incident a few years back, but he also cultivated the Blood Transformation Divine Light, forged a sword core, mastered the sword arts of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, and is at Qi Condensation Layer Six..."

"Oh? So formidable?"

The middle-aged man listened, his face full of surprise. He then silently performed his own divination for a moment, before sighing in admiration. "I didn't expect such a talent to emerge from our Sacred Sect."

Having said that, the middle-aged man was clearly intrigued.

"Come, come, point me in their direction. Let's see what kind of bone roots they possess. If the quality is good, perhaps an excellent treasure pill could be refined."

"That's simple, it's right there—hmm?"

The Butian Peak Master's face had originally held a smile, but as he pointed out the direction and gazed into the distance, his smile gradually faded.

*Boom!*

As the Butian Peak Master's gaze fell, the colossal Butian Peak seemed to be undergoing an "earth dragon turning over," with even rocks tumbling into the sea of clouds from its edges.

Inside a certain cave dwelling on Butian Peak, Liu Xin lay prostrate on the ground, so terrified he didn't even dare to breathe, fearing he would attract the Butian Peak Master's attention.

"He's not looking for me, he's not looking for me..."

Liu Xin desperately muttered to himself, suppressing his guilt and fear.

After all, that was a Foundation Establishment True Immortal. Even a single gaze was enough to suppress and kill someone in the Qi Condensation Realm, and his Myriad Spirit Banner contained the True Immortal's son.

If discovered, it would surely be eternal damnation!

"Don't be afraid, I have a divine talisman protecting me. He can't divine my presence..."

Liu Xin trembled, gripping tightly a talisman he carried with him.

"Yuanchun greets Master."

Lu Yuanchun coughed up blood, kowtowing to the face in the sky to beg for forgiveness. Yet, he felt no joy of surviving a catastrophe, but rather a chilling despair in his heart.

The jade pendant that shattered Lü Yang's Grand Array at the last moment contained a wisp of the Butian Peak Master's divine sense. It was the greatest reliance for Foundation Establishment disciples like him. Because it was difficult to create, once used, it was almost impossible to replenish, essentially equivalent to one's life.

Now, it was gone.

Furthermore, not only had he failed to help Junior Brother Zhao retrieve the fortuitous encounter, he had even failed to protect him, leading to his accidental death. It was a complete and utter defeat.

With multiple offenses compounded, his immortal path was now utterly hopeless in this life.

"This disciple is incompetent."

Lu Yuanchun dared not speak, dared not even explain. He could only choose to prostrate himself, waiting for his Master to kill Lü Yang before deciding his own fate.

*Zheng—!*

Just then, Lu Yuanchun suddenly heard a sword cry. It wasn't loud, but it was exceptionally clear and refreshing, impossible to ignore.

Initially, the sound was like the tinkling of a clear spring, but as time passed, the stream became increasingly turbulent and fierce, the sound growing deafening. Finally, it became a roaring deluge, echoing thunderously throughout heaven and earth.

Lu Yuanchun subconsciously raised his head.

Then, he saw a figure in mid-air, standing tall with head held high under the True Immortal's gaze, his back straight, confronting him without a shred of fear.

Beneath his feet was a surging river of sword qi.

The river was crimson, carrying a monstrous malevolent aura as it churned. Yet, it didn't dissipate, but continuously shrunk, flowed back, and finally condensed into an exquisite sword core.

"What does he intend to do?"

Lu Yuanchun swallowed hard. He had already guessed, but he dared not believe it. How could there be such a brazen person in the world, one who defied fate?

At the same time, the face in the sky seemed to realize something, its brow furrowing.

"You wish to strike at me?"

Lu Yang's expression was indifferent. With the sword core having absorbed the blood river, its sharp edge pointed directly at the sky.

"Please enlighten me, Senior."

The face remained silent, seemingly disdaining to reply.

The next second, Lu Yang saw a black dot suddenly appear in the sky, then rapidly expand, descending slowly towards him with an overwhelming momentum.

Only when the black dot drew closer could Lu Yang barely make out its full form: it was a finger, dropped from an unknown height, its skin texture clearly visible.

Enlightenment immediately struck Lu Yang; this was the other party's reply:

*An ant, how could it know the height of the heavens?*

In an instant, an intense sense of crisis swept through his entire body, almost freezing Lu Yang's thoughts, as if an ant crawling out of its hole had suddenly encountered the vast, clear sky.

"He wants to crush me with a single finger???"

Lu Yang exhaled deeply, then the true qi throughout his body suddenly began to burn fiercely. The Life-Slaying Incantation he had obtained in his second life was now fully unleashed.

At this moment, life and death were cast aside.

Only a surge of fury remained in Lu Yang's heart.

In this life, I sought no conflict, focusing solely on cultivation, yet you divined my karma, sent someone to seize my fortuitous encounter, and when that failed, you personally tried to kill me.

What talk of cultivation law and karma, what talk of predetermined opportunities?

Am I destined to be nothing but a beast of burden, while you are destined to be high and mighty?

"Kill!"

Lu Yang opened his mouth, the true qi in his chest transforming into a long roar. His blazing anger coalesced into a streak of sword light, striking true and cleaving directly into the vast sky.

A silent collision, like the flickering of a candle flame. After a brief brilliance, darkness swallowed Lu Yang's vision, and it swallowed his consciousness.
