# Chapter 229: The Essence of Demonic Flesh and Blood

A muffled sound like tectonic plates colliding echoed from Xu Yunfan’s shoulder blades. Utilizing the unique power-dispelling technique of the Xuan Gang Hundred Refinements Body, his body shifted seven feet to the side. The granite where he had just stood was instantly gouged by a tiger’s claw, leaving five smoking trenches.

Only now did he get a clear look at the demon’s full appearance. This white-browed,吊睛 (tiger) demon was three zhang long. Its entire body was covered in black fur resembling inverted thorns of black steel, and the patterns on its forehead coalesced into a third blood-red pupil. When it opened its mouth to roar, visible shockwaves accompanied the sound.

The stench spewing from its mouth made Xu Yunfan hold his breath involuntarily. It was unbearably foul—a mixture of various rotting scents that made him squint his eyes.

"Saved me the trouble of looking for you."

Xu Yunfan’s wrist flipped, and force erupted. The red patterns on the Seven-Chi Thunderfire Qilin Hammer suddenly flared brightly. Driven by the blood Qi of the Blood Transformation Realm, the thunder and fire entwining the hammer head grew even more intense. The mist in the mountain stream evaporated into white steam upon touching the hammer’s wind.

He hadn't expected such a spectacle. Looking at the treasure-grade heavy hammer in his hand, Xu Yunfan’s eyes shone. He realized he was finally bringing out the weapon's true power.

The tiger demon arched its back like a full moon, its tail whipping the air with sonic booms. Its four claws dug into the ground as it launched itself into the air. Thousand-year-old trees on both sides of the ravine were uprooted, transformed into a rain of wooden spears by the demonic wind.

Xu Yunfan’s heels ground the rock layer to dust. The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength twisted along his spine into a spiral that rose upward, pouring into his arms. As his blood flowed, it circulated throughout his body. The opening stance of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method, "Starfalling天河 (Galaxy)," was swung forth with resolute force.

Wherever the hammer影 (shadow) passed, layers of airwaves exploded in mid-air. The wooden spears, shrouded in visible black煞气 (evil energy), shattered into powder before they could even get close.

A rumbling tiger roar sounded from the demon’s bloody maw. A pair of icy pupils stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan, refusing to let him go. The roar accompanied a black mist that shot toward him.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained unchanged; he was merely sizing up the demon's size. The moment the black煞气 (evil energy) spewed by the roaring tiger crashed into the space before him, the dragon scale armor leaves on Xu Yunfan’s body fluttered rapidly. The incoming torrent of evil energy was decomposed into thousands of细流 (tiny streams), flowing along the vertical grooves of the dragon scales and into the mountain rock beneath his feet.

The dark jade-colored rock layer beneath his feet, as if struck by a meteorite, erupted with countless碎石 (shattered stones) from spiderweb-like cracks, and the ground collapsed with a轰然 (deafening) sound.

Leveraging the momentum, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swung out a half-arc of golden rain. The heavy hammer, carrying the unique, extreme blood Qi of the Blood Transformation Realm, slammed down with a mighty轰然 (roar).

Seeing this, the tiger demon showed no sign of retreating. Or rather, looking at the tiny figure before it, it had no reason to retreat.

Before the hammer head could strike, the compressed blood Qi unleashed astonishing power and speed. The explosive airwaves from the hammer’s劲气 (intent energy) preceded the blow.

*Clang!*

The collision between hammer and claw produced a sound like metal striking metal. The soundwaves spread out, even severing the waterfall less than three zhang away for three breaths’ time.

The instant the Qilin Hammer and the tiger claw made contact, large amounts of Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength surged up the hammer handle and exploded at the head.

Xu Yunfan clearly saw the demonic patterns on the tiger’s palm writhing like living things, attempting to devour the thunderfire on the hammer, only to be burned into焦黑 (charred)纹路 (patterns) by the golden-tinged blood Qi.

The demonic patterns on the tiger’s front paw shattered inch by inch. Xu Yunfan, however, used the recoil to翻腾 (somersault) backward in mid-air. His shoulder blades shifted seven times like an earthworm turning over,卸力 (dispersing the force) of the giant tiger’s explosive劲力 (force) through the dragon scale armor.

It had to be said that the dragon scale armor truly lived up to its title as an Eighth-Rank Divine Weapon. Whether in defense or the enhancement of his own physique, it far exceeded Xu Yunfan’s imagination.

Before his toes even touched the ground, the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength had already窜 (shot) from his足弓 (arch of the foot) to his天灵 (crown of the head). The second hammer, carrying the momentum of a falling meteor, struck down again.

The tiger demon’s blood-red pupil suddenly oozed black blood. The周身 (surrounding) evil energy writhed, and the demonic patterns on its body actually began to transform into chains that wrapped around the heavy hammer.

Although Xu Yunfan was惊异 (surprised) in his heart, he showed no hesitation in his movements. The killing move of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method, "Dragon Raising Its Head," suddenly changed form.

The hammer head, which should have been劈下 (slashing down),划出 (drew) a bizarre arc. The破甲锥 (armor-piercing cone) at the end of the hammer handle射 (shot) precisely into the tiger demon’s forehead.

A earth-shattering scream echoed from the depths of the cave. Demon blood splattered on the cave walls,腐蚀 (corroding)丈许 (a zhang or so) deep pits.

The soundwave caused by the tiger demon’s painful roar collapsed half of the cliff. However, the falling boulders were绞成 (ground into)粉末 (powder) by the气甲 (air armor) formed by the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength and Pure Yang Internal Breath within three尺 (chi) of Xu Yunfan.

The moment the demonic纹锁链 (pattern chains) shattered, the bones throughout Xu Yunfan’s body炸响 (cracked) like frying beans. The speed of a Blood Transformation Realm martial artist was displayed to the fullest.

The afterimage left by the dragging hammer head had not yet dissipated when his true body appeared beneath the tiger demon’s belly. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swept upward from below, and the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength followed the hammer’s momentum to挑飞 (toss) the ten-thousand-jin tiger demon entirely into the air!

The岩壁 (cliff wall) of the ravine轰然 (deafeningly) exploded.

The tiger demon smashed through seven layers of石笋 (stalagmites) and struggled to rise, only to see Xu Yunfan stepping out with a诡步 (strange step) resembling undulating dragon脉 (veins). The Xuan Gang Hundred Refinements Body carried him like a battering ram, crashing through three stone walls.

When the final series of hammer strikes was launched, the thunderfire on the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer intertwined, and his blood Qi nearly formed a交织 (interwoven)赤雾 (red mist). Before the hammer head even arrived, the demonic patterns on the tiger demon’s body began to消融 (melt away) like snow under the scorching sun.

*Thud!*

The moment the hammer head truly landed, the entire Inverted葫芦谷 (Gourd Valley) shook轰然 (tremendously).

Taking the collision point as the center, the rock within ten zhang churned like a soil wave and倒卷 (surged) outward. The ancient柏树 (cypress trees) within ten zhang were截断 (snapped) at the waist by the环状气浪 (ring-shaped airwaves). The waterfall three zhang away briefly formed a奇观 (wonder) of upper and lower分流 (diversions).

The lower half of the water continued to fall, while the upper half was震成 (shaken into)氤氲水雾 (dense water mist) that hung suspended in mid-air.

The cave collapsed by more than half in the roaring din.

Xu Yunfan stood amidst the ruins, holding the hammer aloft with one hand. Seeing that the tiger demon’s body was still intact, his expression relaxed slightly. If this demon had been smashed to pieces by that hammer, he wouldn't have had any rations for what came next.

The boiling, magma-like blood Qi slowly沉寂 (settled). The劲力 (force) still flowed with his blood. What pleased him somewhat was that despite the high-intensity battle, the consumption of his劲力 (force) was less than twenty percent.

Moreover, the Pure Yang Internal Breath and blood Qi he had cultivated were continuously converting into劲力 (force) as a supplement.

However, since Xu Yunfan had set foot in the Blood Transformation Realm, most of the time he did not let his blood Qi do the converting, letting the Pure Yang Internal Breath serve as the supplement instead.

The higher the realm of a武道修行者 (martial cultivator), the more astonishing their physique becomes. Their daily energy consumption far exceeds that of ordinary people. Although their digestion is remarkable, allowing them to absorb most of the energy from food, the operation of converting blood Qi into劲力 (force) consumes a great deal.

In the outside world, it would require eating at least a strange beast or blood deer to make up for it.

When the waterfall began to fall again, he瞥见 (caught a glimpse of) the spiritual energy condensing in the depths of the cave, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a smile.

Dragging the corpse of the black-spotted giant tiger, Xu Yunfan slowly walked toward the depths of the cave.

For the next month, aside from chopping firewood to roast the tiger meat and swallowing the giant tiger’s flesh to digest the demonic essence within, he practiced martial arts diligently.

The Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method was now Great Success. To step into the Marrow Cleansing Realm, he needed to practice it to Perfection.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the Shaking Mountain Hammer Method on his attribute panel, which required five thousand proficiency points. Although he practiced it daily, the proficiency of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method only increased by four or five points, thanks to the support of spiritual energy and the essence of demonic flesh and blood.
