Chapter 401: This Is a Demon, True武 Swallows the Demon

She let out a sharp, piercing shriek, wanting to pull away but finding herself unable to move.

Beneath Xu Yunfan’s skin, dark golden patterns appeared. His large hands firmly pressed down on Hua Xiangrong’s shoulders as she tried to rise, his fingers locking around her like chains.

"Senior Sister, what's wrong? Didn't you like this? Why are you trying to leave so soon?"

"Didn't you say no one would know? Since we're all just 'materials,' what does it matter who dies?"

Xu Yunfan’s voice suddenly turned cold and heavy. A blood-colored vertical split open at the center of his brows, revealing a blazing golden Heaven's Eye.

Hua Xiangrong discovered with utter horror that the Yin energy she had painstakingly cultivated for decades was being frantically sucked away, absorbed by that pillar supporting the heavens.

Then, Xu Yunfan flipped over and pressed Hua Xiangrong down once more, resuming his rhythmic movements.

Two whole days passed.

"No! Stop!"

Her sharp fingernails scraped sparks off Xu Yunfan’s chest, but they couldn't even leave a white mark on his skin. No matter how she struggled, she couldn't stop the loss of her cultivation.

Her voluptuous body visibly withered away, her jet-black hair turning gray strand by strand. "If you kill me, it's infighting among fellow disciples. If you stop now, I can let bygones be bygones! You—"

Xu Yunfan grabbed her by the throat, cutting off her words.

If they had been outside with a third party present, Xu Yunfan wouldn't have been so reckless. But here, in his own territory, he had even set up a concealing array formation in a similar fashion, so he had no hesitation whatsoever.

If he let Hua Xiangrong go halfway through, things truly wouldn't end well. She had come to him with ill intentions from the start, so he naturally wouldn't let her go.

"Coincidentally, I love infighting among fellow disciples."

The speed of the devouring suddenly accelerated. Hua Xiangrong’s skin cracked and peeled like dried tree bark, her eyes bulging out. In the end, she turned into a hideous dried corpse.

*Bang!*

The dried corpse was shattered into dust by Xu Yunfan’s violent movements. He circulated the True武 Devouring Demon technique, swallowing the last wisp of vital energy that had dissipated.

Xu Yunfan’s five fingers slightly spread, and a wisp of dark golden true energy flowed out from his fingertips, coiling through the room like a swimming dragon.

Wherever the true energy passed, the true energy and vital essence contained in the bone dust left by Hua Xiangrong were not left behind in the slightest. They were all swept into it, condensing in the void to form a grayish-white vortex.

"Refine!"

He let out a low shout, and the赤金 Heaven's Eye at his brows suddenly opened. The True武 Millstone within his body began to operate with a rumble.

The mixed true energy that had been devoured was crushed into the millstone, emitting a harsh "creaking" sound, as if thousands of vicious ghosts were wailing.

Impurities seeped out from the gaps of the millstone like black blood, but before they could touch the ground, they were burned into green smoke by the pure Yang true fire.

"The way of True武 is to slay demons as fuel."

Hua Xiangrong was a demon. Using the True武 Devouring Demon Sutra to slay the demon and devour the energy was only natural.

Xu Yunfan felt the increasingly pure true energy flowing through his meridians, golden light flaring in his eyes. "Using your nearly sixty years of cultivation to consolidate my realm and elevate my Dao Foundation is your fortune."

When the last wisp of demonic energy was crushed by the millstone, the entire meditation room suddenly became clear.

The night wind blowing in from the window swept up the remaining ashes. The ashes spun in the air and were swept out of the room, vanishing in an instant.

*You have successfully subdued the demon with True武. The proficiency of the True武 Devouring Demon Sutra has increased.*

On the attribute panel, when the True武 Devouring Demon Sutra was first learned, the cultivation memories it contained spanned nearly a century before the true qi was condensed to its limit. The next step was a leap, transforming the first wisp of true energy within the body.

Subsequently, the True武 Millstone condensed in the Dantian Qi Sea. In the cultivation memories provided by the attribute panel, it was almost formed when one's lifespan was about to end.

Thus, the shackles of heaven and earth were removed from then on.

He slowly walked to the window and looked out.

As dusk fell, thousands of palace lanterns on Hundred Desires Peak lit up one after another.

Glazed lanterns spiraled up the winding mountain path, casting amber halos on the vermilion pillars.

Gilded wind chimes hanging from the cornices and brackets tinkled softly in the wind, making the carved and painted Rain Listening Pavilion and Flowing Cup Pavilion appear like celestial palaces.

The Hall of Hundred Flowers, the Dao field of the Hundred Flowers True Personage at the highest point, was brightly lit throughout. The railings made of a single block of Kunlun jade flowed with misty colors in the light.

The hot springs halfway up the mountain were shrouded in mist. The white jade pool edges were inlaid with night pearls, complementing the gauze curtains hanging on the banks.

Further away, thirty-six fine houses were scattered and hidden deep within the peach forest. Whenever the night wind blew, pink petals mixed with the sweet, cloying scent of incense drifted away.

Beneath this scenery, which resembled a palace in the heavens, lay unknown filth.

The floor of the Rain Listening Pavilion, not far from the cliff edge, was made of sound-absorbing Chen Yin wood, intended to cover up the screams of the cauldrons being drained to death.

The water channel below the Flowing Cup Pavilion was always tinged with light red, traces left by washing away blood and filth.

Even the bottom of the seemingly ethereal hot spring pool was sunk with seven female cultivator skeletons who had been drained of their Yin energy.

They still maintained the posture of struggling with their hands raised before death, their finger bones deeply gouged into the cracks of the warm jade bricks at the bottom of the pool. Then, they were turned into stone by a Foundation Establishment True Personage. It is unknown what great sins they committed in the life of that True Personage.

What is most chilling is that the soil deep in the peach forest is exceptionally fertile. The peach blossoms that bloom every spring are so vibrant they are unsettling.

Newly entered disciples only think it is due to the irrigation of spiritual springs, but they do not know that three or four corpses are buried under every peach tree.

Those are the "discarded" cauldrons of Hundred Desires Peak over the past century.

When the night wind blows, the rustling sound is not only from the branches but also from those forever silent, white bones.

Time flies like a white pony passing through a crevice. In the blink of an eye, several months have passed.

The disappearance of Hua Xiangrong was like a stone cast into a deep pool. At first, it caused a few ripples, but soon it returned to calm.

Occasionally, familiar disciples mentioned her, but found no one knew her whereabouts. Everyone would just exchange a meaningful look, tacitly understanding, and change the subject.

On this Hundred Desires Peak, the disappearance of fellow disciples is already a common occurrence.

Everyone is below the Qi Condensation realm. Treating people as cauldrons and being treated as cauldrons are common occurrences. As long as it is not done in public and the methods are clean and neat, with no one knowing, what can be done about it?

What?

A Foundation Establishment True Personage can use their Dao Foundation to sense karma and find clues.

But you are not a direct disciple of a True Personage, just an ordinary disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect on Hundred Desires Peak. A mere piece of material, why would a True Personage bother with the effort?

Xu Yunfan secretly observed for several days, confirming that no one was pursuing the matter, and only then did his suspended heart completely settle.

He devoted all his mind to cultivation. During the day, he operated the *True武 Subduing Demon Sutra* to temper his true energy, and at night, he used the *Hundred Skeletons Communicating with the Nether术* to open up divergent channels within his body's meridians. Although the main meridians had been repaired, only by reaching the extremities and permeating every inch of flesh can it be perfected.

The peach trees outside the tiled house bloomed and withered, withered and bloomed again, yet he never left his seclusion, immersing himself in cultivation like a stubborn stone.

Winter passed and summer came, and in the blink of an eye, winter had gone and spring had arrived.
