# Chapter 26: Mid Qi Refining Stage

After half a day's labor and exhausting his acting skills to the point of facial stiffness, Jiang Li had gained two beneficial status effects:

[**Tough Hide**: Skin toughness increased by 230%, spiritual energy damage resistance increased by 30 points, duration ∞] (－)  
[**Cool Skin**: Fire resistance increased by 50 points, duration ∞] (－)  

As for the [**Accelerated Qi Recovery**] effect, since Qi-replenishing pills were already common and he possessed some himself, it wasn't counted among his gains.

Jiang Li pinched his skin—it felt tough and rigid, almost impossible to pinch properly. He drew his longsword, a spoil from his travels, and pressed its sharp edge against his wrist. With a forceful drag, the blade scraped against his skin with a grating sound, as if struggling against stone. Applying more pressure might have even chipped the blade.

Inspecting his wrist afterward, he found only a faint white mark that would disappear with a simple rub. His enhanced constitution, already surpassing five points, had elevated his physical attributes far beyond those of ordinary mortals. Now, with [**Tough Hide**] tripling his defensive capabilities, self-harm had become a challenging feat.

Next, he lit a lamp and held his palm directly over the flickering flame. A mild warmth gradually intensified, but only after five minutes of direct exposure did he finally feel pain.  

*Fifty points of fire resistance is already this formidable?* Though ordinary flames paled in comparison to spiritual fire, Jiang Li couldn't help but grin. *If I keep stacking effects, one day... heh heh heh...*  

Then he remembered the two bottles of pills. Picking them up, he scoffed at their meager contents—neither was full.  

**[Name: Bright-Eye Pill]**  
**[Type: Pill]**  
**[Grade: Yellow Tier Mid-Grade]**  
**[Note: Vision failing? Take a Bright-Eye Pill.]**  

**[Name: Blood-Nourishing Pill]**  
**[Type: Pill]**  
**[Grade: Yellow Tier Mid-Grade]**  
**[Note: Vomiting blood? No problem.]**  

Each bottle contained only five pills. *Well, five should be enough.* He dumped both bottles into his mouth at once.  

**[Overdosed on Bright-Eye Pills...]**  
**[Overdosed on Blood-Nourishing Pills...]**  

With two new status effects in place, Jiang Li resumed his cultivation of the *Ghost Wood Art* and practiced the three Qi Refining-stage spells.

### **Three Months Later**  

For three days, Jiang Li remained secluded in his room, with meals delivered by Yan Hong. To the outside world, he feigned severe weakness—after all, many knew of his pill-testing mission, and emerging unscathed would raise suspicions.  

Only on the fourth day did he emerge, his face deliberately pale, and headed to the outer sect’s mass graves to continue his training. Though his fixed status effects made graveyard visits unnecessary for cultivation speed, maintaining appearances was crucial. Additionally, the *Seed Puppet Corpse Technique* required a corpse for practice.  

Time passed in a steady rhythm. Within a month, Yan Hong and the other top-tier spiritual root disciples had all successfully drawn Qi into their bodies, reaching the early Qi Refining stage. As top-ten disciples, they were rewarded with Qi Refining-stage techniques and soon joined Jiang Li and Yu Banxia in attending the outer sect’s lecture hall for advanced studies.  

Jiang Li also maintained his arrangement with the red-haired elder of the Alchemy Hall—neither was willing to let go of this lucrative "test subject."  

Three months later, Jiang Li sat cross-legged on the foul, blackened soil of the mass graves. Poisonous insects like centipedes occasionally burrowed out of the ground, only to writhe in distress before curling up lifelessly.  

Under the cold, full moon’s glow, a thin layer of dead insects littered the ground around him.  

Fifteen thick locust wood logs encircled him in two rings—an inner ring of five with roots buried downward and an outer ring of ten with roots upward. This arrangement was a rudimentary Daoist feng shui formation, a simplified version of a proper cultivation array, representing the Yin Wood element in the Five Phases theory.  

Over the past three months, Jiang Li had "suffered grievous injuries" during each pill-testing session with the red-haired elder but had also profited handsomely. He entrusted Yan Hong with some spirit stones to procure necessary materials—among them, these aged locust logs.  

Under the influence of the Yin Wood formation, Yin energy surged from the graves like a tide, driving out even the hardiest grave-dwelling insects to die on the surface. Yet Jiang Li, seated at the formation’s center, remained unaffected, absorbing the Yin energy without restraint.  

*Crack!*  

A sound like shattering glass echoed in his mind.  

In his consciousness, the visualized seed finally sprouted. A tender shoot stretched toward the moonlight while robust roots dug deep into the soil.  

When Jiang Li opened his eyes much later, joy shimmered in his gaze.  

**"Finally, Mid Qi Refining Stage!"**  

Even with a **500% cultivation speed boost**, reaching this stage had taken three months. Without it, he estimated it would have taken over a year.  

He checked his status panel:  

**[Main Class: Qi Refining Cultivator, Level: Mid-Stage]** (Cultivation speed +600%)  
**[Ghost Wood Art (Qi Refining Chapter) Lv.4]**  
**[Yin Wood Infusion: Cultivation speed of *Ghost Wood Art* increased by 400%, duration ∞]** (－)  

The *Ghost Wood Art* had advanced to Lv.4, and his cultivation stage had officially reached mid Qi Refining. His attributes had also improved significantly, making him a fully qualified mid-stage disciple.  

Thanks to the fifteen-log formation, **[Yin Wood Infusion]** had grown even stronger. Combined with **[Accelerated Qi Recovery]**, his cultivation speed now reached **600%**.  

However, breaking through to the late Qi Refining stage would be far more difficult. Even with his current speed—equivalent to a supreme spiritual root talent—it might take half a year, or even longer.  

Forming hand seals, Jiang Li focused and uttered a single syllable:  

**"Descend."**  

The fifteen logs trembled before sinking into the earth.  

No spell was used—this was pure Qi manipulation. At the mid Qi Refining stage, such feats were now effortless.
