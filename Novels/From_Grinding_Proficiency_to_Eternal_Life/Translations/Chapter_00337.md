# Chapter 337: Crushing to Death

A flick of the finger sent true qi exploding into a sky full of fire.

These sparks were actually strands of true qi that suddenly expanded in the air, transforming into thousands of eerie blue ghost flames.

Xu Yunfan, standing three zhang away, felt a chill run through his body. He immediately tapped the tip of his foot against the擂台 (martial stage), as the Ten Extremes true qi surged through his flesh and blood like a dragon, transforming into pure yang true qi. With a flip of his hand, he struck out.

Instantly, the supreme yang true qi, like a golden crow plummeting to the earth, collided with the phosphorescent flames, erupting in a blinding white light.

"Kekeke, Junior Brother Xu's pure yang skill is still a bit lacking!"

Lu Hou's python robe swelled, and nine icicles suddenly shot out from his sleeves. They were actually able to penetrate the barrier of pure yang true qi, aiming directly for Xu Yunfan's vital acupoints.

Seeing the nine icicles penetrate the pure yang barrier, the chilling intent pressing down on his organs, Xu Yunfan had no intention of blocking them. Instead, he circulated his true qi and poured it into the Dragon Scale Armor.

The scales of the Dragon Scale Armor instantly shimmered with golden light. As the armor plates shifted, a dragon's roar could be heard.

The icicles struck the armor plates but could advance no further. Cracks spread across their surfaces, and they were ultimately shattered into fine powder.

Lu Hou's gaunt face twitched at the sight, his voice shrill as a nightjar: "A fine disciple of the Dao Sect! To actually bestow a Grade 8 divine armor upon you for protection!"

Hearing the old eunuch's words, the crowd below erupted in an uproar, their gazes interweaving.

*— [Polished scene of martial artists discussing] —*

The moment Lu Hou's shrill, nightjar-like voice fell, the martial artists watching from below exploded into a frenzy.

"Grade 8 divine armor?!"

A burly, bearded man with twin swords strapped to his back widened his eyes, his voice cracking. "The Dao Sect is actually willing to give a treasure like that to a disciple? How the hell is anyone supposed to fight him now?!"

"A disciple? Have you not seen his cultivation level? A supreme Grandmaster of the Nine Realms of Qi Condensation—if it weren't for the Great Zhou imperial examination, would we even get to see him?"

A green-robed swordsman beside him sneered. "No wonder he dared to take Lu Hou's Yin Sha palm force head-on... With a Grade 8 divine armor protecting him, even a killing move from a Nine Realm Grandmaster can be taken head-on and he'll still be able to take seven or eight out of ten parts of it!"

On a distant pavilion, several sect elders exchanged glances. One of them, a white-bearded elder, stroked his beard and sighed. "Grade 8 divine armor... The Dao Sect is dead set on pushing Xu Yunfan to the top."

Another whispered, "It seems the rumors are true. The Dao Sect's plans this time are massive; they've even brought out their sect-guarding treasure... But after all these years, how have I never heard that the Dao Sect possessed such a divine armor?"

Down below, the discussion was rampant—some were jealous, some indignant, and others were secretly calculating their own moves.

But no matter what, everyone understood one thing.

With a Grade 8 divine armor on his body, Xu Yunfan was already in an invincible position!

At this moment, Xu Yunfan had already drawn the Flaming Swallowing Dragon Cudgel from his waist.

The cudgel's body was entirely crimson like molten lava. Under the infusion of true qi, the nine sections of dragon scale patterns lit up one by one. The dragon's mouth at the cudgel's head spewed a three-chi-long flame, the heat waves distorting the air and scorching even the blue stones of the martial stage.

Lu Hou's pupils constricted, only now seeing the origin of the Swallowing Dragon Cudgel clearly. He blurted out, "The previous dynasty's Flaming Swallowing Dragon Cudgel?! How could this object be in the hands of a junior like you!"

Not daring to be careless, a silver-threaded soft sword slid out from his sleeve. The blade was as thin as a cicada's wing, and when swung, it was like a venomous snake's tongue flicking out. The edge shimmered with a faint blue, poisoned glint.

It was also a Grade 7 divine weapon.

Xu Yunfan stepped forward and charged, the Flaming Cudgel striking down with the "Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall Cudgel Method." Before the cudgel even arrived, the scorching罡风 (vigor wind) already made Lu Hou's python robe snap loudly in the wind.

But Lu Hou let out a strange smile, the soft sword suddenly stiffening, its tip aiming for the weak point seven inches down the cudgel's body.

This was his technique of "using softness to overcome hardness."

When the two weapons met, the soft sword actually coiled around the cudgel's body like a living creature, and the poisoned blade shot straight for Xu Yunfan's wrist!

Xu Yunfan showed no panic at all. With a light shout, the Ten Extremes true qi poured into the cudgel, and the dragon scale patterns erupted with a piercing red light.

The cudgel shook, the high temperature turning the soft sword a glowing red. Lu Hou was forced to withdraw his sword, the sleeve of his robe still being singed away by half.

Xu Yunfan seized the opportunity to spin, the Flaming Cudgel sweeping horizontally toward Lu Hou's waist and abdomen. However, Lu Hou, like a phantom, soared into the air, lightly tapping the back of the cudgel with his foot to flip backward, while simultaneously flinging three Bone-Piercing Needles, aiming for Xu Yunfan's eyes and throat!

Xu Yunfan neither dodged nor avoided, his gaze as bright as a torch. Having cultivated the Lin Mantra for a long time, his spirit was already powerful, and the trajectory of the needles thrown by the old eunuch was crystal clear to him.

His left hand formed a sword with his fingers, the pure yang true qi condensed into a golden light, and he flicked three times, shattering the needles in mid-air.

However, his right wrist suddenly changed its move, the Flaming Cudgel changing from a sweep to an upward hook. The dragon's mouth at the head of the cudgel roared, and a pillar of flame shot up into the sky!

Lu Hou, in his haste, swung his sword to draw a circle, the cold air condensing into an ice mirror to block it, but it was instantly vaporized by the raging flames, water vapor filling the entire arena.

In the mist, Lu Hou's figure vanished in a flash, reappearing behind Xu Yunfan, the poisoned glint of his soft sword aiming straight for the back of his neck!

Since Xu Yunfan was wearing the divine armor, Lu Hou had to attack his weak points.

Xu Yunfan seemed not to have noticed. Lu Hou was secretly delighted, but he felt something was wrong the moment his sword tip touched his body.

The tip of the sword struck something like iron or stone. At this moment, Xu Yunfan's muscles bulged, as if made of black steel, his skin taking on a bronze luster.

Even a divine weapon couldn't pierce it?!

Lu Hou was shocked and wanted to retreat, but Xu Yunfan swung his cudgel backhandedly. The dragon scales at the end of the cudgel迸发 (erupted) with sparks, smashing Lu Hou's right shoulder and shattering the bone!

Lu Hou staggered back, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, a fierce light flashing in his eyes. Just as he was about to make a move...

Xu Yunfan suddenly stopped and said calmly, "That's about enough."

Lu Hou was stunned, and before he could react, he saw Xu Yunfan gripping the cudgel with both hands. The dragon patterns on the cudgel's body all lit up, the nine sections of the cudgel connecting as one, transforming into the phantom of a fire dragon coiling around his body.

The martial stage beneath his feet collapsed with a rumble. The Ten Extremes true qi all converged into the cudgel. The dragon's mouth at the head of the cudgel opened, revealing its ultimate power for the first time, and let out a earth-shaking dragon's roar!

"Ten Extremes, Return to One."

One cudgel fell, as if the heavens were collapsing.

The phantom of the fire dragon expanded to ten zhang, carrying a momentum that could burn mountains and boil seas, pressing down on Lu Hou.

Lu Hou shrieked as he swung his sword to block, but this Grade 7 divine soft sword snapped like a dry branch. The moment the wind from the cudgel touched the top of his head, fire spewed from Lu Hou's seven orifices, the bones throughout his body cracked and exploded, and his python robe turned to flying ash.

"No!"

In a piercing scream, Lu Hou's body was crushed into a paste of flesh by the vast true qi. The shockwave even blasted a three-zhang-deep pit into the martial stage, stones flying like rain.

When the dust settled, Xu Yunfan stood alone, holding his cudgel. The red glow on the cudgel's body was gradually fading. Only Lu Hou's charred残肢 (broken limbs) were embedded in the bottom of the pit, proving that what had just happened was not an illusion.

Xu Yunfan swept his gaze indifferently over the surroundings, his eyes like a knife's edge passing over the crowd below. Wherever his gaze fell, those originally clamorous martial artists actually fell silent one by one, lowering their heads, not daring to meet his eyes.

His five fingers gently stroked the dragon scale patterns on the Flaming Swallowing Dragon Cudgel. The cudgel's body still had residual warmth, the scorching heat flowing in his palm.

In this battle, he had not used his full strength, yet he had already forced the Nine Realm old eunuch to a dead end.

"He was just testing his moves?!"

On the viewing platform, Chen Wei's pupils constricted violently. The long spear in his hand hummed, the knuckles on his hand bulging with blue veins from the force of his grip.

He stared fixedly at the martial stage, his heart a mix of shock and anger.

Lu Hou cultivated the Yin Sha path; his movement technique was as fast as a strong wind. Even an ordinary Nine Realm expert would find it difficult to even touch the hem of his robe!

But just now, on the martial stage, Xu Yunfan had toyed with Lu Hou like a child, cudgel after cudgel, forcing him into a sorry state!

If he were to go up, could he win?
