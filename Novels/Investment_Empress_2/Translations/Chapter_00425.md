# Chapter 425: Li Mo: "Did the Ice Cube Dream About Me?"

**Room of Autumn Water Pavilion, Li Mo's Room.**

"Huh? Why is it itching again..."

Little Li lay on the bed.

Although his consciousness had already sunk into the Small World, his body was instinctively scratching his neck.

......

**Meanwhile, in the Dream.**

*Do you want to hear what you are saying?*

*Oh, it seems you don't need to listen.*

How could Empress Phoenix, the Palace Master Ying, be the type to just talk without acting?

"!"

Qin Yuzhi had already been petrified, but the scene unfolding before her caused her to be roasted crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, almost shattering into pieces on the spot.

She remembered a kind of creature that was half-human, half-demon, called a Night Ghost. They would hug their prey, rendering them unable to move, then perch on their shoulders and sink their sharp teeth into the prey's veins...

High-level Night Ghosts could even look very similar to humans in appearance. Aside from disliking sunlight, they were almost indistinguishable...

It must be a Night Ghost, and a high-level one at that!

Otherwise, even in a dream, Qin Yuzhi found it hard to believe that the Little Tyrant of the Divine Hammer would be so utterly defenseless.

*The Night Ghost is pretending to be the Palace Master and eating people! Is there no one to manage this?!*

(Slam!)

*Smack—*

The lunch box was smashed onto the ground by Qin Yuzhi.

Ying Bing: "?"

She looked up dazedly at Qin Yuzhi, finding her somewhat unfamiliar. There was clearly no such disciple in the桂宫 (Guigong / Laurel Palace).

She glanced at Li Mo again, that臭弟弟 (stinky little brother) who was dating her, the overbearing Palace Master.

*That's right.*

*How could there be male disciples in the Laurel Palace?*

*Slap—*

The dream began to merge with reality. A ray of sunlight shone in from beyond the heavens, and wherever it passed, illusions and bubbles vanished without a trace.

The Laurel Palace, which was covered in wind and frost all year round, seemed to finally begin melting away at this moment.

The light of Tianshan Mountain covered everything.

"Ha... Ha..."

Early morning, Ying Bing woke up slowly. She looked out the window with hazy eyes, finding the daylight so bright it was blinding.

She placed the back of her hand on her forehead to block the pervasive warm light, momentarily lost in thought.

What had she dreamed about last night?

Right, she had used the "Yellow Millet" technique, guiding herself back to the Laurel Palace using her memories, returning to the time when she was still the Empress Phoenix.

But right before entering the dream, the System appeared at the worst possible time...

And played some scenes from Little Li's mind.

Those scenes were unforgettable!

And so, it naturally shattered the dream she had constructed for herself...

"So..."

Ying Bing stared blankly, recalling the scenes in the dream. Her fair, delicate toes curled up.

The scene she dreamed of yesterday was a plot from *'The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me'*?!

People don't dream of things they haven't seen.

But who told her to happen to see Li Mo guiding Ouyang on the serialization of a picture album, and the location where the plot took place in the album happened to be very similar to her memory of the Laurel Palace!

And... and it was seen by Qin Yuzhi.

**At the same time.**

**Next Door.**

"Today's progress is about the same as yesterday."

"I still need fifty-five 'Upper Forms' or five 'Extreme Forms' for the 'Battle Intent of the Heavens' to reach a new level."

Little Li got up, yawning, and rubbed his temples, but still felt exhausted.

His head was still a bit dizzy, feeling as if his spirit had been drained.

This was normal.

Pulling all-nighters to fight bosses and level up every day. Sometimes, a single boss had to be killed many times. After finishing one, you move on to the next. Anyone would feel dizzy, feeling like a monkey who just finished working overtime.

"Calculating it this way, even when I reach the Nine Apertures of the Divine View, the Power of All Living Beings won't be enough to challenge the Divine Form of the Great Dao."

Li Mo took out the Void Colorful Tower and calculated the progress of gathering the Power of All Living Beings.

Currently, it was a little over level 14. It was a long way to go before reaching level 36.

The main reason was that the speed at which the Power of All Living Beings was gathering had recently shown a trend of slowing down.

Li Mo thought for a moment and felt the reason was simple.

Faith needs to be maintained.

For example, in the Western Regions where Buddhism flourishes, the Buddha exists only in legends, but his golden statues and temples are everywhere, and there are always high monks and virtuous men to spread the teachings.

But as for our Heavenly尊, Immortal Lord, he only manifested his spirit once, and has been in a state of lurking and invisibility ever since.

Over time, his image naturally fades in the minds of the people of the Southern Frontier. The things he once had the people do, like opening up mountains and dredging rivers, would also gradually lose importance.

---

After all, he didn't terrorize the people, and he didn't require offerings like traditional deities, so the people didn't even have a standard way to be devout.

"But the Southern Frontier is so vast, how can I manage it alone?"

Li Mo felt a headache coming on.

He could use a clone to replace his main body, but the problem was his current realm wasn't high enough to support it, and the clone had great limitations.

Let's not talk about anything else.

How many hairs would he have to pull out in a day?

"My bald look..."

Little Li cut off the terrifying thought in his mind, then went to the kitchen to simply make breakfast. Today, he was having hand-pulled noodles and Fudi Red Berries.

Hmm, the Fudi Red Berries looked very similar to strawberries. They were sour and sweet, and had the effect of relieving fatigue and refreshing the mind.

Having a few in the morning was quite "Delicious"!

He had just come out when he saw the Ice Cube sitting there, looking at the对面 (opposite) with a gloomy expression.

Qin Yuzhi was looking up at the sky at a 45-degree angle, appearing as if her soul had drifted away.

"Eat some fruit in the morning."

Li Mo didn't think too much about it and put the "Delicious Berries" on the table.

Then he scratched his neck. Why is it itching even more today?

It's strange. With my physique, can I have sensitive skin?

"Pfft..."

Qin Yuzhi picked up a Fudi Red Berry and just happened to see Li Mo scratching his neck. The water she had just drunk spurted out.

"This is..."

"Strawberries. They taste great. Sour and sweet, that's me."

Li Mo found the name introduced by the System too difficult to pronounce.

"I... I don't like fruit."

"?"

A confusing breakfast began.

Sharp-eyed Li Mo noticed that the Ice Cube had her hair loose. The black hair was being brushed by the wind, repeatedly grazing the corners of her mouth, almost slipping in.

So he said casually:

"Ice Cube, your hair is loose. Let me help you..."

"!"

Ying Bing's clear, deep eyes trembled slightly.

"I... I can do it myself..."

"Your hands are curled up like that. Are you cold?"

Li Mo naturally took her jade hairpin, rolled it at the end of her black hair, and then naturally coiled it up.

After doing it, he was stunned himself.

*Strange, why am I so skilled?*

*Is this also a natural talent?*

"Cough cough cough... Cough!"

Qin Yuzhi, upon seeing this, a mighty Seventh Realm expert, was almost choked to death by a noodle soup.

"What's wrong with you?" Li Mo asked curiously.

"I was... taking a stroll last night."

"Where did you stroll?"

Qin Yuzhi said guiltily, "In a dream. Then I accidentally,嗯, definitely not on purpose, wandered into Little Bing'er's dream."

Ying Bing's heart tightened.

Sure enough, that Qin Yuzhi wasn't originally in the dream!

Li Mo became interested and asked with a smile, "What kind of dream did she have? It wouldn't be a nightmare again, would it?"

"No, on the contrary... she dreamed of you."

Qin Yuzhi looked at her, then at him, and shook her head solemnly.

"It's nothing. It was a very ordinary dream." Ying Bing's face was expressionless, but the fingers holding the chopsticks couldn't help but curl tighter.

"What was it like?" Li Mo was genuinely curious.

"She tied you up..."

*Snap—*

The chopsticks broke with a crisp sound. Although Qin Yuzhi was at the Profound Mystery Realm, she felt a chill down her neck.

"...Ahem, she tied you up, then lectured you. You were completely defenseless."

"??"

A small question mark popped up over Li Mo's head.

This was vastly different from what he had imagined.

Why would the Ice Cube, who is usually so well-behaved, lecture him?

And I, the Little Tyrant of the Divine Hammer... uh, the Fourth on the潜龙 (Hidden Dragon) List, ranked even higher than the Ice Cube.

How could I be completely defenseless?

Is this reasonable?
