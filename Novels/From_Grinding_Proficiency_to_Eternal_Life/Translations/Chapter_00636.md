# Chapter 636: The Divine Core Takes Residence

Left hands moved with幻影-like speed, fingers dancing through the air to instantly lay down a simple Minor Five-Element Binding Spirit Array that covered the battlefield. Though far inferior to the Grand Array of Mount Shenxiao, it was enough to temporarily disrupt the replenishment of Tatus's divine power.

This was one of his recent research achievements targeting incense and faith power.

Now deployed, its effect was excellent.

Right hands formed the Shenxiao Thunder Summoning Seal. The thick thunderclouds above, stirred by Tatus's divine kingdom, were forcibly torn open.

"The Nine Heavens Respond, Shenxiao Heeds the Command!"

The Dharma Form's voice boomed like thunder.

A purple-gold divine thunder, far more condensed and pure than Tatus's, carrying a majestic heavenly might and the true meaning of destruction, descended fiercely from the rift in the clouds. Its target was not Tatus's true body, but the head of the giant thunder spirit phantom behind him.

This was the manifestation of a divine core, naturally taking the brunt of the attack.

Tatus's eyes nearly split from rage. Was this even fair?

He was the God of Thunder!

Although not a true deity presiding over thunder, he could still summon lightning.

Now, the quality of the thunder descending upon him was vastly superior.

How could he fight?

Tatus already harbored intentions of retreat.

He roared furiously, urging the giant spirit's arms to cross and block.

The purple-gold divine thunder exploded violently. The berserk power of destruction instantly tore through the crossed thunder arms and slammed into the giant spirit's chest.

The phantom let out a silent哀鸣. A terrifying hole was blasted open in its chest, the lightning rapidly dissipated, and its entire form became illusory and unstable.

Seizing this golden opportunity, the main head of Xu Yunfan's Dharma Form flashed with ferocious light.

The two golden-armored arms facing the giant fists head-on suddenly exerted force, fingers like dragon claws digging into the opponent's thunder arms.

The Word of Strife and the Northern Purple Weasel Suppressing Evil Primordial Qi operated at full power, multiplying his strength instantly.

"Break."

Along with Xu Yunfan's soft command.

Riiip!

A grating tearing sound echoed.

The thunder giant凝聚 by Tatus was actually torn apart by the three-zhang golden body, a thunder arm as large as a small mountain ripped away.

The dissipated lightning poured down like a waterfall, reflecting Tatus's instantly pale stone-carved face.

Xu Yunfan's Dharma Form did not hesitate. Wielding the still-struggling, roaring thunder arm as a weapon, he swung it round and smashed it down toward Tatus's main body.

Simultaneously, he opened his mouth and spat out a barely visible purple-gold thunder ray containing piercing power. Hidden behind the berserk momentum of the thunder arm, it shot silently toward the lightning divine mark between Tatus's brows.

In just a few breaths, Xu Yunfan had already skillfully locked onto the location of the opponent's divine core.

Tatus roared in shock and anger, his body surging with thunder energy to resist硬抗.

However, the backlash from the shattered giant spirit had already caused a barely perceptible stagnation in the circulation of his divine power.

More fatally, Zhang Ziyang, lurking at the edge of the battlefield like a candle flame in the dark night, saw the silver star used to probe the divine core flare to its peak.

An invisible fluctuation, piercing through the subtle and pointing directly at the flaw, accurately穿透 Tatus's护体 thunder energy and enveloped his divine core.

A moment's hesitation was the divide between life and death.

"To be围殴 by a Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivator, you should consider it a blessing in three lifetimes."

Hearing Xu Yunfan's words, Tatus was furious inside.

Being beaten and still being called blessed?

Boom!!!

The thunder arm smashed squarely onto Tatus's crossed blocking arms. The berserk force smashed his mountain-like body down to one knee.

The ice sheet exploded, spiderweb cracks spreading a hundred yards.

And at the peak of this power explosion, the hidden purple-gold thunder ray, like a snake spitting its tongue, pierced precisely into the exact center of his divine mark.

"Argah!"

A scream so凄厉 it distorted tore through the northern plains' cold wind.

The lightning divine mark on Tatus's brows, like glass struck by a heavy blow, was instantly covered in cracks.

At its core, the divine core bearing his authority and power source trembled violently. Berserk thunder divine power surged out from the cracks uncontrollably, burning his stone-carved face black.

Xu Yunfan's Dharma Form's eyes were as cold as ice.

The three-zhang golden body took a step forward, the earth roaring.

Six arms, covered in entwined lightning, raised high simultaneously. Fingers spread wide like a sky-encompassing net, carrying the terrifying momentum of sealing space and suppressing all laws, they clamped down fiercely upon the heavily injured, power-uncontrolled God of Thunder, Tatus.

The dark shadow of the Star Spirit Banner had already silently unfolded in his sleeve.

Xu Yunfan's Dharma Form's six arms, like collapsing celestial pillars, closed with the might of annihilating thunder.

Fingers spread wide, the thunder patterns in the palms intertwined with the Northern Purple Weasel Suppressing Evil Primordial Qi to form a purple-gold electric net covering a radius of ten yards, locking down Tatus's crumbling body.

The space groaned under the unbearable strain, and shattered ice crystals were crushed into dust by the invisible force field.

"Capture!"

The main head of the Dharma Form commanded like thunder.

The dark light of the Star Spirit Banner in the sleeve flared, the banner surface unfurling instantly to transform into a deep vortex that swallowed light.

Tatus couldn't even let out a scream. The shattered divine core between his brows was forcibly剥离. Strands of blue-white lightning arcs, like dying struggling snakes, hissed and jumped on the banner's dark light.

His massive stone body rapidly崩解 into flying debris, then were swept away by the Star Spirit Banner's dark light, along with a wisp of remaining furious will, and swallowed into the banner's void.

Xu Yunfan's three-zhang golden body Dharma Form slowly dissipated. His true body stood at the edge of the ice plain rift, raising a hand to recall the Star Spirit Banner.

His divine sense probed into the banner. He saw the残魂 of the God of Thunder疯狂 impacting against the golden chains formed by the enlightening power. Countless符文 fragments containing the laws of thunder within the opponent's remaining divine power were forcibly剥离, then反复碾磨 by the周天星斗大阵 within the banner.

Tatus's arrogant roars gradually turned into mental-level哀嚎. Finally, under the continuous will冲刷, he归于沉寂, transforming into a banner spirit wrapped in thunder patterns with a blurred face, standing静立 at a certain star position.

'成功炼化中位神灵 Tatus 残魂为幡灵, Star Spirit Banner origin提升, 周天星斗大阵 (45/365)'

A prompt滑过 the vision silently.

Xu Yunfan felt a sense of emotion. He had fought生生死死 for so long, yet the Star Lord positions of the 周天星斗大阵 hadn't even reached half, and among them, there were some he considered utterly incompetent.

It was truly difficult.

This was the foundation Xu Yunfan had accumulated by plundering two worlds.

He was always a little unsatisfied.

If he were in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, and he狂杀 forty-plus Foundation Establishment true cultivators alone, the next moment a Golden Core True Lord would appear before him fully geared up and give him a critical hit on a basic attack.

"It's finally done."

Zhang Ziyang's figure emerged from the void, the silver star of exploration between his brows dim, carrying a hint of exhaustion.

He looked at the rhombic divine core in Xu Yunfan's hand, still jumping with blue-white electric arcs.

"The divine core is shattered nearly half, the core imprint has been磨灭, but the 'Subordinate Contract' imprint of the Winter God System contained within it remains. This area belongs to the God of Winter,洛克曼. He will definitely sense it."

Xu Yunfan's fingertips rubbed the Thunder Divine Core. Beneath the cold touch was the berserk thunder origin.

To call it a thunder origin was a bit of a stretch.

After all, it was merely a God of Thunder, barely touching the edge of true thunder.
