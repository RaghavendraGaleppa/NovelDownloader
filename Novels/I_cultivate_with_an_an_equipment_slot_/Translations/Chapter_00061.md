# Chapter 61: What Can I Do?

"Golden Grass-Cutting Sword!"

Upon spotting the aphids in the spirit field, Zhang Yan gave a light flick of his finger. A golden flash streaked through the air before the aphids could react, slicing them down instantly.

The Golden Grass-Cutting Sword was a standard pest-elimination spell—fast yet mild in power, making it perfect for insect control. But these weren't ordinary aphids. They had been specially selected by the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace, each sporting an exceptionally tough exoskeleton that rendered them nearly impervious to common spells. Their only weakness was a susceptibility to insecticide, which was why they had been chosen as part of the examination.

Yet, Zhang Yan had just effortlessly obliterated them with a single strike of the Golden Grass-Cutting Sword? And so cleanly at that?

This… this wasn’t right, was it?

What was even more baffling was that Zhang Yan proceeded to collect the slain aphids, removed their shells, and then—fried them.

"These should be edible, right?" Zhang Yan mused, examining the crispy insects in his hand. While eating bugs wasn’t exactly a common practice, he could sense faint traces of spiritual energy within them. It’d be a waste not to consume them. He had initially planned to try them himself, but upon closer inspection, they looked rather unappetizing.

"Ah well, lucky you," Zhang Yan sighed, tossing the fried aphids to his dim-witted bird companion. The bird, of course, had no qualms about eating them—it gobbled up the spirit-infused insects with delight, even gazing at Zhang Yan afterward with a look that clearly said, "More, please!"

Zhang Yan could only shrug helplessly. There weren’t that many aphids to begin with, and they were all gone now. He couldn’t very well go around exterminating pests in other participants' spirit fields, could he?

The supervising judge overseeing Zhang Yan’s performance was utterly dumbfounded. Over the course of the competition, he had already been astonished by Zhang Yan’s abilities—first, he had displayed two perfected-level spells, and now, he had unleashed an incredibly powerful pest-elimination technique. The judge racked his brain, unable to comprehend how such a swift, instantaneous spell could pack such devastating force.

And to make matters worse, those supposedly indestructible aphids had just been turned into bird feed. Did Zhang Yan have any idea how much effort others had to put into exterminating these pests?

"Is this really the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace’s test? It’s way too easy!" Zhang Yan scoffed, curling his lip in disdain. He had expected the Spirit Plant Grand Competition to present some truly formidable challenges, but this? This was nothing. And he had only enhanced his spell with a mere Level 1 Sharpness attribute!

"Maybe the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace has something else up their sleeve?" Zhang Yan mused. He never underestimated his opponents, especially disciples from a sect as prestigious as the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace. After all, they were backed by a Nascent Soul powerhouse—surely they had some extraordinary techniques up their sleeves. Still, he was confident that with enough effort, even the disciples of a Nascent Soul sect wouldn’t be able to best him.

At the very least, not in the art of spirit plant cultivation.

Unbeknownst to Zhang Yan, this single wave of pest infestation had already forced a third of the participants to forfeit the competition. There was simply no way around it—those damned aphids from the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace were ridiculously fast and nearly impervious to attacks. How were mere Qi Refinement cultivators supposed to deal with them?

"Wait… is he actually going to win?" Zhuge Wan, who had been closely monitoring Zhang Yan’s progress, couldn’t help but wonder. Her initial goal had merely been to surpass the Verdant Spirit Sect, but now, it seemed this kid might actually clinch first place.

"Could it be… that the Wood Spirit Peak of the Green Scale Sect is about to flourish under my leadership?" Zhuge Wan’s mind raced with possibilities.

But while she was elated, others were far from pleased—especially the members of the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace. For centuries, their sect had dominated the Spirit Plant Grand Competition, never once allowing an outsider to claim the top spot. Were they really about to lose their streak now?

Yet, there was little they could do about it. They couldn’t exactly cheat—not with so many Golden Core cultivators watching.

"Well, there’s still the disease outbreak round," one of the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace elders remarked. "Let’s pick a particularly vicious one. If he can handle that too, then so be it—let him have first place. We’ve held the top position for so long that it’s become stagnant. A little competition might do us good. Our sect has grown complacent, looking down on outsiders for too long. If we don’t adapt, we’ll fall behind eventually."

And so, it was decided: another wave of disease would be unleashed upon the participants—this time, an especially severe one.

Thanks to Zhang Yan, everyone else was about to suffer an unforeseen calamity. The other contestants couldn’t fathom why this year’s competition had to be so brutal. First, an infestation of near-indestructible pests, and now, a devastating plant disease? At this rate, being a spirit plant cultivator seemed more like a death sentence than a profession.

"If every planting session involves dealing with this kind of nonsense, we might as well all quit and go raise chickens instead!" one participant grumbled.

Zhuge Wan’s expression darkened as she observed these developments. It was clear to her now—the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace was deliberately targeting her disciple.

"If it weren’t for that Nascent Soul ancestor of theirs…" she muttered under her breath. "Hmph. But once my martial uncle emerges from seclusion, we’ll see if they can still act so high and mighty. The balance of power in Zhao Kingdom is due for a shift."

Though she recognized the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace’s underhanded tactics, Zhuge Wan chose to bide her time. After all, when outmatched, sometimes the wisest course was to endure. That said, there were limits—if the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace pushed things too far, the Green Scale Sect wouldn’t take it lying down. A Nascent Soul expert might be formidable, but the Green Scale Sect had its own defensive formations. And it wasn’t as if the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace’s patriarch could keep watch over their disciples every second of the day. Given the opportunity, Golden Core cultivators like her could always retaliate with targeted strikes.

Besides… this was just a spirit plant competition. Surely the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace wouldn’t stoop so low as to openly bully a single participant. At the very least, they had maintained some semblance of fairness by increasing the difficulty for their own disciples as well.

……

"Hmm? This is…" Zhang Yan’s eyes gleamed with interest as he examined a withering spirit plant before him. The disease affecting it was fascinating—it seemed to target all types of spirit plants indiscriminately, likely to ensure uniformity in the competition.

"While it spreads quickly and is highly lethal, the transmission vector seems limited… only through root contact?" Thanks to his extensive experience, Zhang Yan quickly deduced the disease’s mechanism. He immediately uprooted the most severely infected plants, ensuring not a single trace of their roots remained in the soil. Only then did he begin treating the remaining plants.

Thanks to the knowledge he had gained from Zhuge Wan’s spirit plant cultivation set, dealing with plant diseases was relatively straightforward for him. This was especially true now that he had acquired several spirit plant-related artifacts at the auction, each imbued with specialized enchantments. Selecting a spell attribute tailored to disease eradication, he set to work.

As Zhang Yan tended to the plants, Zhuge Wan received a flying sword messenger. She unrolled the attached jade slip, her expression growing solemn as she read its contents.
