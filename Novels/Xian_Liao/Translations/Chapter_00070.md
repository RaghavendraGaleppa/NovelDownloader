# Chapter 70: Eternal Spring and Agelessness

This fusion was peculiar—it didn't require mastering both the Rejuvenation Talisman Codex and the Taiyue True Form Talisman Codex before merging them. Zhou Qing hesitated briefly before choosing to proceed.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Zhou Qing felt his Vitality Mastery absorbing his qi and blood like a whale gulping water, while the intermediate-level characters of his Literary Core rapidly dimmed. After what seemed like an eternity, his body trembled slightly, his complexion pale as if recovering from a serious illness.

He first checked his Vitality Mastery status:

**Lifespan: 120 years.**

His lifespan remained unaffected, and the depleted qi and blood would eventually recover. Zhou Qing exhaled in relief. It had been a long time since he last felt this weak—the previous instance being during his soul projection experiment.

He had refrained from attempting soul projection again, believing that the stronger his qi and blood became, the lower the risk would be. After mastering the Five Organs Thunder Resonance, his qi and blood had grown astonishingly potent. He had considered attempting soul projection again but postponed it due to recent events in Jiangzhou City and his commitment to safeguarding Fushong and Zhang Jingxiu.

Now, with the fusion of the Rejuvenation Talisman Codex and Taiyue True Form Talisman Codex, the soul projection experiment would have to wait again.

Originally listed under "Extraordinary Techniques" in his Vitality Mastery, the two manuals had now merged to form a new technique—**Eternal Spring and Ageless Art (Fragmentary Version)**. The characters appeared translucent, indicating it couldn't be practiced yet.

A new category appeared in his Vitality Mastery:

**Immortal Arts: Eternal Spring and Ageless Art (Fragmentary Version).**

The contents of Vitality Mastery were named based on his understanding and memory—essentially using his cognition to interpret his cultivation progress. Names like Eternal Spring and Ageless Art, Tiger-Crane Twin Forms Fist, and Shadowless Kick were all derived from his memories, with corresponding similarities in function.

"Immortal Arts? Eternal Spring and Ageless Art? Fragmentary Version?" Zhou Qing felt a surge of excitement at the words "Immortal Arts" before calming himself. 

Immortal cultivation—this day was bound to come eventually. He had always known. Yet, he still unconsciously shattered a section of his bed frame.

After composing himself, Zhou Qing quietly pondered the meaning behind this technique's name while absorbing its contents. After a long while, he exhaled deeply.

"So this is a method for cultivating true qi after reaching the Innate Realm. Its essence requires the birth of true qi to practice. That's why the Rejuvenation Talisman Codex and Taiyue True Form Talisman Codex were classified as 'techniques' rather than 'principles'—they used qi, blood, Crane Force, and Taiyue Force to simulate the effects of true qi without actually being true qi."

Zhou Qing analyzed the Eternal Spring and Ageless Art in detail, piecing together its intricacies.

---

He grasped a crucial point: "Both the Rejuvenation Talisman Codex and Taiyue True Form Talisman Codex focused on qi, blood, and the physical body, with minimal emphasis on tempering the spirit. The Rejuvenation Talisman Codex only contained the Crane Form Technique, which had a negligible effect on spiritual refinement through visualization. Although Senior Brother Fushong clearly practiced spiritual cultivation, it was merely common Daoist tempering methods—nothing exceptional."

Zhou Qing then recalled Zhang Jingxiu's mention of "Sun-Moon Spirit Refinement." Through their recent interactions, Zhou Qing noticed Zhang Jingxiu's spiritual cultivation far surpassed Fushong's. The Taihe Sect's techniques evidently balanced qi, blood, and spirit refinement. Before even reaching the Innate Realm, Zhang Jingxiu could withstand several exchanges with Fushan, who had been in the Innate Realm for years.

From these details, Zhou Qing deduced the root of Fushan and Fushong's issues—insufficient spirit refinement. He decided to consult Zhang Jingxiu further.

---

"Indeed, after reaching the Innate Realm, one forms divine sense. I felt it resembled a seed sprouting roots and growing. Based on my current experience, as long as one's spiritual power is sufficiently strong, forming divine sense upon reaching the Innate Realm happens naturally," Zhang Jingxiu shared.

He now practiced observing the sun during the day and the moon at night, absorbing their essence to strengthen his divine sense. This was a slow, gradual process with minimal daily gains but steady progress—a unique aspect of the Taihe Sect's "Sun-Moon Spirit Refinement," mastered only by its founder and Zhang Jingxiu since the sect's establishment.

Zhou Qing inquired further about Zhang Jingxiu's spirit refinement methods. Suddenly, he realized his own method of nurturing the spirit through reading shared similarities with "Sun-Moon Spirit Refinement." His approach was simpler, with smaller gains, but progress was consistent.

From Zhang Jingxiu's perspective, Zhou Qing's spiritual power was already remarkably strong, enabling him to master the Five Organs Thunder Resonance.

Zhou Qing didn't hold back, sharing the secrets of Five Organs Thunder Resonance with Zhang Jingxiu to see if it could be practiced after reaching the Innate Realm. Zhang Jingxiu attempted but shook his head.

"Strange. I can now comprehend the profundity of the Six-Word Health Mantra, but understanding doesn't translate to achieving your results. It's inferior to my original Organ Thunder Resonance." Zhang Jingxiu could produce the sounds but couldn't replicate Zhou Qing's effects.

After extensive discussion, they concluded: One must master the entire Five Animal Frolics before the body fully matures to lay the foundation for Five Organs Thunder Resonance.

---

The Five Animal Frolics remained the cornerstone of the Five Organs Techniques. Five Organs Thunder Resonance was one of its hallmarks—like quicksilver flowing through the body, enhancing explosive power and endurance over time. This synergy between internal and external thunder resonances significantly accelerated Zhou Qing's marrow cleansing and bone reforging.

However, this also increased his demand for elixirs, prompting him to refine Foundation Consolidation Pills. Without high-quality elixirs, his progress would stagnate. Previously, he relied on other medicinal supplements, but their efficacy diminished over time.

"In the future, the spiritual herbs required for the Innate Realm will only become rarer. I must venture deeper into the mountains to gather them and acquire pill recipes involving inner alchemy," Zhou Qing mused before refocusing on alchemy.

---

Observing the translucent, blood-streaked Foundation Consolidation Pills before him, Zhou Qing smiled in satisfaction. His beginner-level alchemy had officially begun. However, further progress seemed daunting—if the beginner stage was this challenging, how much more difficult would advanced alchemy be?

Dismissing distractions, Zhou Qing meditated to replenish his energy before consuming the pills. His tendons, bones, and flesh seemed to come alive, greedily absorbing the medicinal energy.

The Innate Realm was drawing nearer!

This would also allow him to nourish the Great Mulberry Tree with his yang energy—killing multiple birds with one stone.

Zhang Jingxiu remained at Qingfu Temple, needing two to three years to complete his Innate transformation—a process that couldn't be rushed. Staying there allowed him to watch over the two elderly Daoists while having Zhou Qing as backup should cultivation mishaps occur.

In the path of cultivation, "Dao companions" weren't limited to women—male companions were equally valid, referring to fellow cultivators. At his current stage, Zhang Jingxiu's most suitable discussion partners were naturally the three brothers of Qingfu Temple.

Between his own training sessions, Zhou Qing instructed Miss Lin and Butcher Hu to gather rare herbs for another pill—Foundation Consolidation Pills—derived from the "Foundation Consolidation Decoction" in the Rejuvenation Talisman Codex. After careful deliberation, he simplified and adapted it into pill form.

Naturally, he couldn't start with the millennium ganoderma. Common ganoderma trials in his courtyard sufficed for preliminary experiments.

Zhou Qing increased his spirit-nurturing reading sessions, learning from past lessons. Simultaneously, he allocated time to test the Foundation Consolidation Pills. Soon, the small courtyard accumulated failed pills and medicinal residues, which the rooster and Great Mulberry Tree happily devoured.

One day, Zhou Qing noticed the Great Mulberry Tree had grown taller and sturdier, its canopy expanding to nearly envelop the entire courtyard. From afar, Butcher Hu marveled at the sight, spreading rumors about the tree's auspicious feng shui and Zhou Qing's destined greatness.

"How great?" curious villagers asked.

Butcher Hu whispered mysteriously, "With the empire in chaos, the Imperial Scholar might carve out his own kingdom."

As leader of the Black Tiger Gang, Butcher Hu's current mission was to weave divine narratives around Zhou Qing. Unaware of Zhou Qing's ultimate plans, he understood that any force needed a core figurehead and belief system to thrive in turbulent times.

In the north, the Peaceful Path sect revered their leader—the "Nine Heavens True Man," said to be impervious to weapons and flames, a benevolent immortal descended to save mortals. Similarly, the Riverclear Prince employed formidable experts to thwart assassinations.

Meanwhile, the capital stood isolated as regional governors operated independently. During this period, Zhou Qing's requested herbs trickled in slowly.

"Progress is too slow," Zhou Qing remarked upon receiving the last batch.

Butcher Hu explained nervously, "Transport routes are blocked, with shipments often hijacked—especially since we can't use waterways."

"Because of the Sea Sand Gang?" Zhou Qing frowned.

"Exactly."

"I'll deal with them eventually." Zhou Qing knew Butcher Hu wasn't slacking and didn't press further.

Unlike the Golden Light Temple, the Sea Sand Gang dominated waterways with swift mobility. Killing their leader Qin Bao had been futile—a new leader emerged swiftly. The gang's true master was the third son of Grand Secretary Shang, whose influence remained formidable despite the chaos. Many factions still deferred to the venerable elder for mediation, such as stabilizing Jiangxi Province by tacitly accepting the Riverclear Prince's separatist rule—a temporary peace preceding greater storms.

Regardless, the Shang family flourished, enabling the Sea Sand Gang to monopolize waterway trade—except shipments bound for Jiangzhou City, which they intercepted without fail.

"I'll settle accounts after reaching the Innate Realm." Zhou Qing couldn't leave Jiangzhou now—in these chaotic times, one's stronghold was the only safe haven. Who knew what dangers lurked beyond? Even Innate experts were merely flesh and blood, susceptible to exhaustion.

"First, succeed in refining the Foundation Consolidation Pills."

Zhou Qing began trials with common herbs before progressing to rarer, older specimens—including century-old ganoderma—before finally attempting the millennium ganoderma.

After disposing of corpses and consuming copious failed pills, the courtyard's faint spiritual energy grew even more elusive—barely detectable except to Zhou Qing's heightened senses. Yet, the yin energy he drew from the Great Mulberry Tree grew purer.

His depleted qi and blood from the fusion had replenished quickly, though the intermediate Literary Core characters remained dim. Moreover, his qi and blood grew increasingly condensed, acquiring a mercury-like quality—flowing through his body with terrifying explosive force and endurance.

Over time, these effects intensified, amplifying the thunderous resonance between his sinews and bones, synergizing with the Five Organs Thunder Resonance to accelerate his marrow cleansing and bone reforging. Consequently, his elixir demands surged—hence the Foundation Consolidation Pills. Without them, his progress would plateau. Previous substitutes had diminishing returns.

"The spiritual herbs needed for the Innate Realm will only become scarcer. I must venture deeper into the mountains and acquire inner alchemy pill recipes," Zhou Qing thought before refocusing on alchemy.

---

Gazing at the crystalline, blood-veined Foundation Consolidation Pills, Zhou Qing smiled. His beginner alchemy had officially begun—though advancing further seemed daunting. If the beginner stage was this challenging, how much more difficult would higher tiers be?

After clearing his mind and replenishing his energy, Zhou Qing consumed the pills. His tendons, bones, and flesh seemed sentient, voraciously absorbing the medicinal energy.

The Innate Realm was within reach!

Simultaneously, he could nourish the Great Mulberry Tree with his yang energy—a multifaceted benefit.

Zhang Jingxiu remained at Qingfu Temple for his two-to-three-year Innate transformation. Staying there allowed him to oversee the elderly Daoists while having Zhou Qing as backup for cultivation emergencies. On the path of cultivation, "Dao companions" included both genders—fellow seekers of the Dao. Currently, the Qingfu Temple trio were Zhang Jingxiu's ideal discussion partners.

Between training, Zhou Qing tasked Miss Lin and Butcher Hu with gathering rare herbs for Foundation Consolidation Pills—adapted from the Rejuvenation Talisman Codex's "Foundation Consolidation Decoction." After refinement, he created the pill version, starting with common ganoderma trials before attempting the millennium specimen.

His courtyard soon accumulated failed pills and residues, devoured by the rooster and Great Mulberry Tree—the latter growing so large its canopy nearly covered the entire yard. Butcher Hu spread tales of its auspicious feng shui and Zhou Qing's impending greatness, hinting at kingship in these chaotic times.

As the Black Tiger Gang leader, Butcher Hu wove divine narratives around Zhou Qing—a necessary core for any rising power. Meanwhile, northern factions like the Peaceful Path sect and Riverclear Prince's forces thrived, while the capital stood isolated amid regional fragmentation.

Herb shipments arrived slowly due to Sea Sand Gang's waterway blockade—a problem Zhou Qing would address post-Innate. For now, he focused on perfecting Foundation Consolidation Pills, progressing from common to rare herbs, then century-old ganoderma, before the final millennium trial.

After processing corpses and consuming residues, the courtyard's spiritual energy dwindled further, though the Great Mulberry Tree's yin energy grew purer. Zhou Qing's qi and blood replenished quickly post-fusion, though his Literary Core remained dim. His condensed qi and blood now flowed like mercury, enhancing his explosive power and endurance—synergizing with his thunder resonances to accelerate marrow cleansing and bone reforging, albeit with escalating elixir demands. Thus, the Foundation Consolidation Pills were essential—past substitutes had plateaued.

"The Innate Realm's spiritual herbs will only grow rarer. I must gather them from deep mountains and acquire inner alchemy recipes," Zhou Qing resolved before immersing himself in alchemy once more.
