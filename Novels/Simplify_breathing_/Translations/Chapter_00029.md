# Chapter 29: Immortal's Guidance

The entire day, Pingyin County remained calm and quiet. Chen Fei felt a little puzzled. Did the people in the county yamen not believe his message? That was a possibility; after all, such a clandestine method made it hard to gain trust. But at the very least, the yamen should have sent someone to investigate. If they genuinely put in the effort, they would surely find some clues.

During the day, Chen Fei practiced the Lieshan Sword, occasionally studying the Qingling Pill recipe to give his mind a break. The Qingling Pill recipe he got from Chi Defeng wasn't entirely useless, but it was exaggerated to say it had much value, as very little could be discerned from it. Fortunately, Chen Fei had a System Panel. After simplifying the recipe, he obtained a complete alchemy technique for the Qingling Pill. When refining any pill, there are many details that require attention, and alchemy techniques are used to adjust the changes within the pill furnace. Thus, this Qingling Pill alchemy technique was helpful to Chen Fei. However, the specific medicinal ingredients required for the Qingling Pill would have to be deduced by Chen Fei himself. Chen Fei had been thinking about whether he could buy a few more similar pill recipes and try to simplify them to see if he could gain more insights.

"Those mountain bandits actually broke through the encirclement!"

Chen Fei's brows furrowed slightly. The sounds of fighting in the distance began to spread, clearly indicating that the county yamen's ambush had failed. The sounds of battle approached from afar, with bandits surging in this direction, pursued by yamen constables. Gradually, the sounds faded, and it was unclear whether the bandits had been killed or the constables counter-killed. Occasional noises persisted but were slowly returning to calm. Chen Fei sheathed his longsword and was about to return to his room when suddenly, three figures leaped over the courtyard wall. The three individuals were also momentarily stunned when they saw Chen Fei in the courtyard.

"It's him."

Jian Liang recognized Chen Fei immediately as the physician from before. He hadn't expected to encounter him here; it was truly a strange twist of fate.

"Who are you?!"

Chen Fei nervously retreated a step, seemingly overly frightened, stumbling and falling to the ground.

"Kill him!" Jian Liang ordered, then turned cautiously to look outside the courtyard wall. If there was any movement outside, they might have to continue running soon. Those yamen constables were still hot on their heels. As for Chen Fei's past kindness in treating them, Jian Liang didn't take it to heart at all. Letting them go last time was already a show of mercy. Now that they met again, Jian Liang had no intention of revealing his true identity; it would be simpler just to kill the man.

The clash of weapons rang out. Chen Fei was forced back a step. Just as Jian Liang was about to pursue, Chen Fei's longsword thrust towards his face.

"Hmph!"

A burst of sword energy shot forth, leaving a bloody cut on Jian Liang's cheek, and a few strands of hair floated into the air. Jian Liang's eyes showed a trace of shock. A moment ago, he had almost been run through the head by that sword energy. If he hadn't realized something was wrong at the last moment and quickly dodged, he would be dead by now. After the fear, came extreme fury. An ant he could have easily crushed before, he had spared out of mercy. Now, he was almost killed in retaliation. How could Jian Liang endure this?

"Die!" Jian Liang roared, veins bulging on his forehead. The blade in his hand seemed to transform into the vast waves of an azure sea, roaring towards Chen Fei.

"Clang!"

With a dull thud, the sword hilt, which was blocking in front of him, struck Chen Fei's chest. Chen Fei was thrown against the courtyard wall, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.

"I will peel your flesh off, slice by slice!"
