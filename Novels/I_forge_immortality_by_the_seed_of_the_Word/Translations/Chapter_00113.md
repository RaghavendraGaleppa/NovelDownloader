# Chapter 111: Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud  

With a flash, Zhang Jing's figure vanished from the Myriad Treasures Repository and reappeared in the cave.  

Lowering his gaze, he slowly unclenched his left hand, revealing twenty-five grains of Time River Gold Sand. Though he had mentally prepared himself for this moment when making the decision earlier, a trace of nervousness still crept into his heart now that it had truly arrived.  

Every ounce of spiritual essence he had gathered over the past month had been exchanged for these grains of Time River Gold Sand, all to serve as experience for upgrading the Pure Essence Absorption Visualization Technique.  

For Zhang Jing, this was nothing short of a high-stakes gamble!  

With only four months left before the closure of the Myriad Gods Miniature Void Heaven, if the newly transformed Dao Seed from the Pure Essence Absorption Visualization Technique failed to meet his expectations, he could almost foresee himself missing out on that coveted inheritance.  

And that wasn't all.  

Without the Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light, his comprehension speed of the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent would plummet. Achieving a perfected Dao Intent and a Golden Dao Foundation might become nothing more than distant dreams.  

Though the odds were slim—what if it happened?  

As time passed, Zhang Jing's hesitation gradually faded.  

"If I succeed, I'll lay the foundation for immortality. If not, a Cyan-Gold Dao Foundation isn't bad either," he muttered with a forced smile.  

Indeed, given his current level of Dao Intent comprehension, Zhang Jing was already capable of establishing a Cyan-Gold Dao Foundation like Senior Brother You—a realization that had dawned upon him when his Dao Intent first broke through the 10% threshold.  

Moreover, he was still young.  

Who knew? He might even catch the next opening of the Myriad Gods Miniature Void Heaven.  

With this thought, Zhang Jing steeled himself.  

Taking a deep breath, he deftly picked up a grain of Time River Gold Sand and pressed it firmly against his brow.  

---  

The next day.  

The second-to-last grain of Time River Gold Sand was pressed against Zhang Jing's forehead, emitting a faint, hazy glow.  

The jade talisman slowly materialized.  

The experience value behind the Pure Essence Absorption Visualization Technique began to steadily and resolutely increase.  

Finally—  

**[Pure Essence Absorption Visualization Technique · Level 9 (/)]**  
**Skill Traits:** Gathering Essence Spiritual Light (Low-Grade), Crimson Spirit Light (Mid-Grade), Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light (High-Grade)  

In an instant, the information about the Pure Essence Absorption Visualization Technique on the jade talisman, including its three skill traits, blurred into obscurity, as if dissolving into a swirling chaos.  

An indeterminate amount of time later.  

Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes and immediately looked at the jade talisman.  

The information about the Pure Essence Absorption Visualization Technique had vanished entirely, replaced by a brand-new name:  

**[Supreme-Grade Dao Seed: Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud (Cannot Be Upgraded)]**  

"Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud?"  

Zhang Jing silently repeated the name in his mind.  

In the next moment, a radiant five-colored light shot out from the jade talisman and plunged straight into his sea of consciousness.  

Inside his mind, at the very center of his sea of consciousness, a Dao Seed resembling a cloud now hovered—woven entirely from intricate five-colored Dao patterns and profound laws.  

The five hues shimmered and intertwined, sometimes merging into a chaotic blend, other times separating into distinct strands.  

Merely gazing upon it filled Zhang Jing with inexplicable insights that blossomed and faded in fleeting succession.  

Before he could react, a torrent of vast information surged forth like a tidal wave, submerging his consciousness entirely.  

Roughly half an hour later.  

His awareness gradually cleared.  

As his vision sharpened, the momentary confusion in Zhang Jing's eyes gave way to uncontainable excitement.  

His earlier predictions had been correct—the Pure Essence Absorption Visualization Technique had undergone a qualitative transformation upon evolving into a Dao Seed.  

The five lights—Gathering Essence, Crimson Spirit, Dao-Guiding, Primal Origin, and Chaos Fusion—intertwined to form the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud, bestowing it with numerous miraculous abilities. Naturally, the Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light's enlightenment-enhancing properties were retained, now even more potent than before.  

With a thought, Zhang Jing activated the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Dao Seed.  

Instantly, the five-colored radiance blazed brilliantly in his sea of consciousness.  

Above his head, the five-colored light materialized abruptly, weaving into a resplendent Auspicious Cloud that exuded an aura of profound mystery.  

In that very instant, Zhang Jing felt as though the veil separating him from the heavens and earth had been gently lifted.  

The world unfolded before his senses with unparalleled clarity.  

The flow of every wisp of wind, the trajectory of every drifting cloud, even the trees, rocks, and specks of dust—all seemed to resonate with intricate laws and principles.  

Yet, the moment he sought to delve deeper, everything became indistinct once more.  

The sensation was ineffable.  

Zhang Jing lifted his gaze.  

At that moment, he perceived with absolute clarity the location of the inheritance—separated from his current position by two barriers.  

The Auspicious Cloud above his head slowly dissipated.  

"The Tenth Void Heaven..."  

Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed with quiet determination.  

All traces of anxiety had vanished from his heart.  

Connecting with the Dao pattern in his palm, he checked his reserves:  

**[Spiritual Essence: 437,900]**  

"With 430,000 units of spiritual essence, I can test how effective the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud is in comprehending the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent," Zhang Jing mused with a faint smile before vanishing from the spot.  

---  

Inside the Myriad Treasures Repository.  

The grand doors swung open.  

"Zhang Jing, you're back! Here to comprehend the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent again?" The Infant Sovereign fiddled with its "Transformation Blocks," not even bothering to look up as it spoke.  

"Yes, the same as before," Zhang Jing replied with a nod.  

The Infant Sovereign acknowledged with a wave of its tiny hand, and Zhang Jing's figure vanished instantly.  

Three to five breaths later.  

The clattering of the Transformation Blocks abruptly ceased.  

As if recalling something, the Infant Sovereign halted its movements and glanced at the spot where Zhang Jing had stood, its face betraying a rare hint of regret.  

"It's been so long since the discovery of the Aurora Magnetic Sea, yet Zhang Jing still hasn't grasped its fundamentals. Is it a lack of affinity?" it murmured in its childlike voice.  

"What a pity."  

---  

On the meditation mat.  

Zhang Jing activated the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Dao Seed, and his spiritual consciousness began depleting at a terrifying rate.  

Above his head, the five-colored Auspicious Cloud shimmered with radiant light.  

A nostalgic smile touched his lips.  

This was a familiar sensation.  

This time, to test the Auspicious Cloud's efficacy, Zhang Jing refrained from using any supplementary aids like Enlightenment Tea.  

"Begin comprehension," he commanded inwardly.  

With 430,000 units of spiritual essence, he could only purchase less than half an hour of Dao Intent comprehension time.  

In the past, Zhang Jing would have felt the time slip away too quickly, leaving him with little to show for it.  

But this time was different.  

The moment the complete Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent manifested, Zhang Jing instantly grasped its myriad principles and concepts.  

Though most remained hazy, as if obscured by thick gauze, some aspects stood out with crystalline clarity.  

A flood of new insights swirled within his mind.  

As the last wisp of spiritual essence was exhausted, the room returned to silence.  

The illusory jade talisman materialized once more:  

**[Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent (163/1000)]**  

"My Dao Intent progress increased by 20 points, and I only spent 410,000 units of spiritual essence this time. That means roughly 20,000 units per point of Dao Intent."  

At this realization, excitement flickered in Zhang Jing's eyes.  

This implied that even if he remained in the Eighth Void Heaven, he could fully master the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent in just two months!  

And if he advanced to the Ninth Void Heaven, the time required would shrink even further.  

More importantly, without the recovery period imposed by the Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light, Zhang Jing could now engage in comprehension anytime, anywhere!  

"With four months left, I'll aim to reach the Tenth Void Heaven within two months!"
