# Chapter 24: My Name is Can, Style Name Volcano

The old steward, Deng Xun, smiled and replied, "This old servant believes that this young man is very ambitious and calculating."

"Oh?"

"He has only been by the young master's side for half a year. The young master only took him in to repay a life-saving favor. At the time, it was also a critical moment for the negotiations regarding the marriage alliance between the Yu and Suo families. The young master couldn't possibly have entrusted him with all the details."

"You mean, regarding the relationship between our Yu and Suo families, he deduced it himself from some subtle clues?"

"Yes!"

"Go on."

"The responsibility for the young master's demise certainly cannot be pinned on a mere guest advisor. However, strictly speaking, a guest advisor is not considered a member of our Yu family, but rather a personal friend recruited by the young master. With the young master's death, this person's connection to our Yu family is severed. But here in Longshang, if he leaves the Yu family, what other出路 does he have? This person took a risky path, using the method of framing the Suo family to enter your lordship's good graces. One could say he is both daring and resourceful."

Yu Xinglong smiled faintly. "While this move was risky, if he guessed correctly, there is great potential for success."

"Exactly. That is why this old servant believes this young man has both ambition and means. For one so young to possess such cunning and strategy is truly rare."

"Indeed..."

Yu Xinglong lightly tapped the table with his fingers, his gaze falling on a pile of ledgers at the corner of the desk. They were the accounts for the property and personnel transferred back by Yu Huanhu.

Six large manors, totaling more than fifty thousand mu of good farmland.

Three horse breeding farms, with a total of over fifteen thousand warhorses raised.

In addition, there were tens of thousands of people attached to these manors and pastures, including herders, tenant farmers, and free citizens.

These were everything his son had exchanged his life for. Oh, and he must also add the position of "heir" that was unanimously passed.

Yu Xinglong smiled self-deprecatingly. No sooner had these assets been returned than they were already being eyed by others. The side branches, the various stewards, and especially that fool Yu Xiaobao, who has high ambitions but little ability...

Who should he entrust the management of these properties to?

The great stewards of the family, while trustworthy, are also untrustworthy.

They are trustworthy because their power originates from the Yu clan. Therefore, their interests are aligned with the Yu family's; they rise and fall together.

They are untrustworthy because they have never explicitly taken a side in the conflict between the main and second lines. Now that the eldest son has passed away early and the second son is still young, it will be even more difficult to win them over. Entrusting these properties to them in this situation would only serve to increase their bargaining chips.

As for Yu Xiaobao and the other side branches of the Yu family, Yu Xinglong did not even consider them. Having already suffered a loss at the hands of Yu Huanhu, how could he not learn from the lesson?

For Yu Xinglong, loyalty comes first, though ability is also indispensable. He is not lacking in people under his command who possess either loyalty or ability. However, finding someone who possesses both is not easy...

After pondering for a long time, Yu Xinglong suddenly said, "Xiao Deng, what do you think about letting Yang Can become a steward in the main line?"

Deng Xun's expression changed slightly. "My lord, you want to use him?"

"Precisely."

Steward Deng's graying eyebrows furrowed slightly, a hint of confusion appearing in his eyes. For a moment, he could not fathom the deeper meaning behind his lord's plan.

Deng Xun said hesitantly, "My lord, this Yang Can has already deeply offended the Suo family. It is not impossible for you to use him, but sending him to the main line... wouldn't that..."

"Make the Suo family displeased, and make my daughter-in-law displeased, is that it?"

Yu Xinglong rose from his seat and walked to the window, standing with his hands behind his back. The spring light filtered through the carved window lattice, casting dappled shadows on his face.

"The manors and pastures returned by Huanhu, I will also place entirely under the management of the main line! In this way, would the Suo family and my daughter-in-law still be displeased?"

Steward Deng vaguely grasped Yu Xinglong's intention and said hesitantly, "My lord, you want to use the manors and pastures to reassure the Suo clan. And use Yang Can as a nail wedged into the main line, for future use?"

Yu Xinglong nodded slightly. "Xiao Deng, you truly understand me! Since this Yang Can sought to advance through opportunism, this lord will give him the chance. The assets Huanhu handed over, I will allocate entirely to the main line. In this way, the Suo family will have no reason to cause trouble over a mere Yang Can."

A gust of wind blew past outside the window, causing the "iron horse" wind chimes under the eaves to clatter. Steward Deng had already understood, a hint of a smile appearing on his face. "We do not yet know if the young mistress is pregnant. Even if she is, whether she can give birth to a male infant will only be known after nine months."

Yu Xinglong returned to his desk and sat down, picking up a thin porcelain teacup and gently stirring the amber-colored tea. "If she gives birth to a son, the Suo family will have grounds to interfere further, even plotting for the position of heir..."

Steward Deng said, "At that time, we can 'find some new evidence' and have Yang Can step forward to frame the Suo family again, thereby cutting off the claws the Suo family has extended."

Yu Xinglong said, "If the Suo woman is not pregnant, or gives birth to a daughter, the Suo family will have no reason to meddle. This lord can then take these properties back from the main line at any time."

Steward Deng clapped his hands and laughed. "The second master, in order to extricate himself, had to sever his own arm and is certainly not very willing. If he wants to use these manors to cause trouble, this year's autumn harvest will surely be disastrous. At that time, someone will have to step forward to take the responsibility."

Yu Xinglong smiled faintly. "The accounting will be at the end of the year, and my daughter-in-law, if she is pregnant, will be giving birth around that time..."

Steward Deng said meaningfully, "To cut the Suo family's claws, we need Yang Can. To give an account to the various lines and branches, we also need a Yang Can."

Yu Xinglong nodded slightly, took a sip of his tea, and then said calmly, "Go and make the arrangements."

"Yes!" Steward Deng respectfully agreed, then asked in a low voice, "My lord, should we send someone to the Central Plains to investigate the background of this Ding Hao and the Luo family?"

"No need," Yu Xinglong said淡淡ly. "When the poplar leaves turn a golden yellow, it will be time for the fruit to ripen and fall. By then, the fruit that is Yang Can, no matter who it is to be served to, must be picked. Could we possibly let it rot on the tree?"

The next day, Yu Xinglong received Yang Can again.

"Yang Can, you were a person valued by my son Chengye, and you also saved his life. This lord will not treat you poorly," Yu Xinglong said to Yang Can with a kind expression. "You were originally a member of the main line, and you can no longer serve as a guest advisor. After much deliberation, I wish to hire you as the second steward of the main line. Are you willing?"

The "main line" Yu Xinglong spoke of, more accurately, should be the main line branch, or the main line of the main branch. However, everyone had become accustomed to using "main line" to refer to the main line of the main branch.

Yang Can was secretly delighted. This move in the game had indeed worked. He did not hide the joy in his heart. A young man should show his emotions. The less deep his scheming, the more the higher-ups would feel at ease using him.

Yang Can cupped his fists gratefully. "With the clan lord's trust, this subordinate... I dare not but devote my utmost and exert my life's effort for you."

From today on, he also had the资格 to call himself a vassal of the Yu family. Although his position as steward was only for the external affairs of Chengye's branch, it was still very different from someone like Yi She, who represented the Yu family and held sway in a region. But regardless, this step was of critical importance. It was like the barrier between a clerk and an official; only by crossing it could one face a vast and boundless world.

Yu Xinglong seemed very satisfied with Yang Can's declaration. He stroked his beard and smiled. "I looked at your records; you are twenty-three this year, past the age of capping. You should have a style name to establish yourself in the world. I wonder if you have ever asked an elder to give you one?"

Yang Can said, "When I fled from the Central Plains to Longshang, I had not yet reached the age of capping, so I never asked an elder for a style name."

Yu Xinglong pondered for a moment, then nodded. "Since that is the case, this lord will recommend himself. Your name is Can (灿), and the character for Can means like starlight or a spark. However, a spark must eventually start a prairie fire to achieve its momentum. I have it..."

Yu Xinglong raised his eyebrows. "For your style name, why not take 'Volcano' (火山)? What do you say?"

Yang Can bowed. "A gift from an elder, I dare not refuse. I am willing to take Volcano as my style name,效仿ing the momentum of molten rock breaking through the earth, and存ing the ambition to erupt and soar to the heavens!"

Yu Xinglong smiled. "Very good! Xiao Deng..."

Yu Xinglong turned his head to look at Steward Deng standing by his side. "Escort Volcano to the main line and help him settle in."

Inside the inner quarters of the main line, Little Qingmei was in high spirits. She sat on a round-backed chair in front of the screen wall in the passageway, legs crossed, holding a cup of tea in her hand. The little hand捏着the tea lid, idly skimming the tea leaves, her eyes sweeping over the rows of maids and matrons standing before her. This style was something she had secretly learned from Matron Tu. When she was with the Suo family, she had seen the scene of Matron Tu summoning maids and matrons to lecture them.

The maids and matrons standing before her were about half from the Suo family's dowry, and the other half were originally from the main line. Little Qingmei's lecture today was mainly aimed at those who were originally from the Yu family's main line.

"You are all people who have been in high-walled compounds for a long time. Whether you came with the young mistress from her maiden family or were originally serving in the main line, you should all understand the rules and know when to advance and retreat," the little girl's tongue was quite glib. When she spoke these words, they were clear and resonant, like a famous actor singing an aria, audible throughout the entire courtyard.

"Our young mistress is a broad-minded and lenient master and will not treat anyone harshly. But as servants, we must also have a sense of propriety in our hearts."

At this point, Little Qingmei took a sip of tea, putting on an air of maturity. "Rules are rules. The master's leniency is the master's grace. We cannot, just because we are older, more familiar with faces, or have been here longer, become lax and lazy, or even obey in public but defy in private..."

*Pop~* Little Qingmei's agile tongue flicked, spitting out a tea leaf neatly, her sharp eyes shooting sideways. "From now on, if anyone dares to do such a thing, once this girl catches you, it will be you throwing yourself onto a bed of nails. Don't blame anyone else."

Little Qingmei stood up, placed the teacup on a small table beside her, put her hands behind her back, and walked down the stone steps with her chest puffed out. "From now on, the rules in this residence must be made clear. Things that should be done, not one may be omitted; words that should not be spoken, not one may be spread. If anyone doesn't take this girl's instructions seriously, the young mistress may be easy to talk to, but that doesn't mean this girl is easy to talk to. Since the young mistress has appointed this girl as the second steward of the main line, then some people had better weigh whether their bones are harder or the family law is harder..."

"Qing... Qingmei-jiejie..."

A pretty maidservant in a cyan dress, who looked even younger than Qingmei, hurried over from under the flower-lined corridor and called out to her.

"On formal occasions, remember to call me Second Steward!" Little Qingmei's pretty face hardened. This Qiaoshe was originally a person from the main line, and Qingmei had a先天 hostility towards her. Little Qingmei put on a stern face and said in a affected tone, "What is it?"

Qiaoshe's eyes held a hint of playful laughter as she said loudly, "Second Steward, the Second Steward has arrived."
