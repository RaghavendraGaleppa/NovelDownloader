# Chapter 94: Planting the Curse

The [Fortune's Blessing] Dao Seed floated within Han's sea of consciousness like a translucent egg. Suspended motionless at its center, it remained undisturbed by any external influence. When Han focused his mind upon it, he found the seed utterly unresponsive to his will—unable to activate any mystical properties, appearing as little more than an ornament.

From Wubing's accounts, Han had learned much about this [Fortune's Blessing] Dao Seed. Since awakening this divine ability, Wubing had rarely witnessed its effects. Most often, it provided only subtle guidance, influencing his choices in imperceptible ways. Unable to manipulate the seed himself, Han could only let it be.

For the next three days, Han remained in the beast quarters, consolidating his cultivation. He didn't even rush to consume the [Metal-Devouring Honey] Wubing had retrieved. When he finally felt prepared to [Summon Thunder] again, he mounted Wubing and departed.

They arrived at a low hill where Han instructed Wubing to wait while he flashed ten miles away. This second attempt at [Summoning Thunder] felt far more familiar. Compared to his previous attempt, Han now possessed two additional divine abilities and a second-tier spirit beast companion—his power had grown substantially.

Holding the [Fallen Immortal] flying sword, Han soon summoned a thundercloud. Channeling his magic power, he swung his blade to meet a descending lightning bolt. A deafening thunderclap shook the heavens! This time, Han faced the lightning with remarkable composure—clear evidence of his progress.

As successive bolts rained down, Han continued deflecting them with his sword, both he and [Fallen Immortal] voraciously absorbing the lightning's energy to strengthen their foundations. Once again, he reached his limit—though this time enduring one more bolt than before. Suppressing his instinct to flee, Han steeled himself for another round of endurance.

Bolt after bolt hammered down. Perhaps having grown accustomed to the [Summon Thunder] technique's intensity, though thoroughly electrocuted and battered, Han actually found the experience less agonizing than before. This time, he withstood a full seven lightning strikes before the thundercloud dissipated—his first complete endurance of the [Summon Thunder] secret art.

In that moment, Han felt his Dao heart expand tremendously, his confidence surging. Gathering himself, he dragged his half-dead body back to Wubing's back with a flash step, immediately activating his [Heavenly Dew] ability to begin healing.

Wubing stared at the charred, barely human-shaped lump on his back and shuddered violently. "Master," the bear said, "you're the truly ruthless one here! Is this how all Divine Thunder Palace disciples cultivate? Who would dare provoke you people?" The unspoken thought lingered in his mind: You're all complete madmen.

With Wubing guarding him, Han could focus entirely on recovery. These injuries proved no less severe than last time—likely requiring another ten-plus days to fully heal. Assessing his gains, Han found he'd successfully condensed over fifty more Thunder Nurturing Runes, while [Fallen Immortal] had advanced two more refinements, reaching First Rotation, Fifth Refinement. The more lightning he endured, the faster his cultivation progressed—his [Body-Nourishing Soul Thunder Method] now neared its third Great Perfection.

As Han remained silent in recovery, Wubing carried him across Golden Saber Gorge, sniffing the air until catching a scent that sent him racing across the desolate metal-hued plains. For hours they traveled through the lifeless landscape until Wubing halted, having tracked down another colony of [Metal-Devouring Bees].

Concealed in shadow, the giant panda observed the bees entering and exiting their massive hive. After careful study, Wubing stealthily stalked an isolated bee, ambushing it as it collected minerals away from the hive. Pinning the struggling insect, Wubing implanted a strand of his [Pure Yang Dao Heart Curse] into its consciousness. After violent convulsions, the bee suddenly calmed, then affectionately approached Wubing when released—now completely under the curse's control.

Through this first successful implantation, Wubing transitioned from being a cursed vessel to becoming a curse master. He commanded the bee to return to its hive, gaining a sensory extension within the colony. Internally, he felt his [Pure Yang Dao Heart Curse] strengthen slightly, his spiritual sense growing correspondingly. Thrilled by discovering this proper application of his ability, Wubing grew even more satisfied with the technique.

Meanwhile, Han—as master of the [Heart Demon Great Curse] compendium and practitioner of the [Vajra King Curse]—could clearly perceive Wubing's implanted curse. He realized that if he chose, he could easily override Wubing's commands to its subject. He too received a slight enhancement to his [Heart Demon Great Curse], reinforcing his belief in this supreme demonic method's terrifying, unreasonable potency.

The technique's convenience and immediate effects were undeniable—yet Han clearly understood that without sufficient Dao heart, a curse master could easily become addicted to accumulating subjects for rapid power gains. As compendium holder, he knew this path to immortality remained fraught with difficulty. The Divine Thunder Palace's orthodox methods remained the true great path.

This didn't preclude Han from utilizing the [Heart Demon Great Curse] alongside his foundational cultivation—after all, it remained an exceptionally powerful divine ability.
