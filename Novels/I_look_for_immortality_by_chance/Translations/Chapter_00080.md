# Chapter 80: Seizing the Spiritual Peak, the Golden Sword Formation! (Please Subscribe!)

At Qingyue Peak, barely an hour had passed since Gu Yuan set up the formation disk when dawn broke.

In the distance, atop the eight supreme spiritual peaks, the glow of spells continued unabated, accompanied by thunderous roars.

After a long while, a cultivator at the eighth level of Qi Refinement, having failed to seize a peak, retreated dejectedly and began searching for other unclaimed spiritual mountains.

"A mere seventh-level Qi Refinement cultivator dares to covet a high-grade spiritual peak?" 

A fair-faced young man, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, arrived before Qingyue Peak. Seeing Gu Yuan seated cross-legged, he sneered contemptuously and immediately launched an attack.

Gu Yuan merely smiled faintly.

"Boom!"

The battle was swift. Before long, the young man staggered away, clutching his abdomen, his body covered in bloody wounds.

Onlookers hidden in the shadows paled, hesitating to act.

Several hours later, as dusk fell, the hidden observers could no longer restrain themselves and launched a coordinated assault on the mountaintop.

"Boom!"

"Clang!"

Spiritual energy churned violently, mist swirled, rain poured, and the roar of sword energy echoed across the entire peak.

Eventually, silence returned.

Several cultivators, their faces filled with panic and lingering fear, fled Qingyue Peak in disarray.

Night fell once more.

Time continued to pass.

Finally, the first light of dawn broke, its golden rays lazily illuminating Feilang Mountain as they had for millennia.

"Clang!"

The formation disk before Gu Yuan emitted a crisp sound, golden ripples spreading across the entire peak like water.

An invisible barrier rose from beneath Gu Yuan's feet, encasing the entire peak like a golden eggshell.

"Chirp chirp!"

The emerald water ape, accompanied by the remaining demon beasts, knelt before Gu Yuan, kowtowing repeatedly, their faces filled with sorrow.

With the formation disk in place, Qingyue Peak now belonged entirely to Gu Yuan and the Daoist Academy. Every demon beast on the mountain was like a caged bird, their lives at his mercy.

He had truly become the master of the spiritual peak.

"At last, it's done!"

Gazing at the golden sun in the sky and the roaring waterfall before him, Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh.

Though he had gained much from this journey, plundering numerous treasures, none compared to the stability offered by the spiritual peak beneath his feet.

A blessed land of spiritual mountains was the true foundation.

While the life of a rogue cultivator was thrilling, it was not the path of kings.

It was akin to the difference between venturing into business and holding a secure government position—fundamentally distinct.

"Still, it feels a bit empty."

Frowning at the sparse gathering of demon apes and spirit deer, Gu Yuan suddenly felt the peak was too quiet. Without enough demon beasts, there was a lack of labor force.

"Ah!"

With a self-deprecating sigh, he mounted his flying shuttle and headed toward another peak where the formation disk had yet to be placed.

...

"Who dares challenge me for this peak... and its spirit beasts?"

"Where did this thief come from? Huh? You again?!"

"Senior Brother, be careful! Guard the formation disk—that thief is back!"

Shouts echoed across the peaks, turning the once-quiet Feilang Mountain into a scene of chaos.

After a long while, back at Qingyue Peak, the water ape stared at the row of bound creatures—dream spirit fire foxes, blazing cloud ice birds, fire toads, water spirit deer—with an utterly bewildered expression.

"From this day forth, the water ape shall serve as the peak's chief steward, bestowed with the name Yunshan, overseeing all affairs of the mountain."

"Each year, I shall return to collect spiritual herbs, exotic fruits, and demon materials, the total value of which must not fall below 350 spirit stones."

"If the quota is unmet, I shall take the difference from your own flesh!"

Seated atop the peak, Gu Yuan coldly addressed the now-bustling crowd of demon beasts.

The creatures wore expressions of indignation, and the water ape gesticulated wildly, as if trying to negotiate.

But Gu Yuan said no more, merely waving his sleeve to dismiss them.

His expedition to Feilang Mountain had been bountiful, yielding ample resources to advance to the eighth level of Qi Refinement—perhaps even the ninth.

Given his brief tenure as peak master, he intended to extract all he could from the demon beasts.

...

"Clang!"

"Clang!"

"Clang!"

As Gu Yuan concluded his arrangements, the three-day period officially ended.

Golden light radiated from the peaks of Feilang Mountain, interconnecting to form a grander formation.

Yet nine peaks remained dark and silent, preventing the formation from completing.

Even among the highest-grade peaks, one stood devoid of light.

"Alas!"

A sigh echoed through the void as a frail figure slowly materialized.

Dressed in white Daoist robes, his stern countenance bore a golden vertical mark between his brows—Zhou Qisheng, the headmaster of the Hidden Dragon Academy.

Surveying the nine peaks, Zhou Qisheng sighed softly. As his vast spiritual power surged, the golden mark on his forehead glowed like a third eye snapping open.

In an instant, nine beams of golden light, bright as the sun, shot toward the dormant peaks.

"Roar!"

"Screech!"

Panicked howls and strange cries erupted from the nine mountains.

"Was it not agreed that the Green Peak Daoist Academy's Foundation Establishment cultivators would not intervene?"

"With such treachery, how can the Azurefire Water Apes subdue the demons of the Great River? Henceforth, when the Green Peak Academy's treasure ships arrive, we might as well surrender!"

The voices were filled with fury and confusion.

"Alas!"

Seemingly hearing these protests, a brilliant golden light erupted from the Great River beside Feilang Mountain, violently intercepting the nine beams.

"Hmph!"

With a flick of his sleeve, Zhou Qisheng vanished from the peaks, plunging straight into the Chiyue Great River below.

"Boom!"

The sound of thunder rumbled beneath the waters. After a long while, the river turned crimson, reeking of blood.

Eventually, Zhou Qisheng reappeared among the mountains.

"Clang!"

With a snap of his fingers, a crimson seal split into nine golden threads, streaking toward the mountain range behind Feilang Mountain.

Nine agonized shrieks echoed before silence reclaimed the land.

"The Azurefire Water Apes, obstinate and defiant, sought to hinder our academy's reclamation of Feilang Mountain and murdered our disciples. They have been eradicated."

"By the decree of the Daoist Academy, the Golden Sword Formation is hereby deployed, returning Feilang Mountain to the academy's jurisdiction!"

As his voice faded, golden light finally ignited across the last nine peaks. The 108 formations resonated with sword chants, their phantom blades converging into a colossal golden sword that pointed ominously toward the Chiyue Great River.
