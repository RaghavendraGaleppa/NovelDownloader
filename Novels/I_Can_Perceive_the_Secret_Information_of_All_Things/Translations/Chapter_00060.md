# Chapter 60: The Last Bloodline of the Skywing Tiger Clan  

This was supposed to be an ordinary hunting trip, but in Qian Duoyu's heart, it became a journey that could change his life.  

Because he met a peculiar Daoist and gained something extraordinary.  

The Daoist made him realize that fascinating things could happen between people in this world.  

He also gained his first true friend on the path of cultivation.  

Before this, he had always believed friendship needed spirit stones to maintain—and that was exactly how he had operated in the past.  

Xiao Ji was frustrated because Qian Duoyu had changed when it came to making friends.  

How he wished this plump cultivator, who had little interest in spirit stones, would go back to using them to forge friendships.  

Two days later, they found the dwelling of the Skywing Tiger Demons in the Nine Nether Valley—a mountain beside a small lake.  

The Skywing Tiger Demons were different from what they had imagined. They weren’t born with wings, nor could every tiger fly.  

Only the lineage of the Tiger King possessed the innate talent for wings, and whether they could grow them and take flight depended on their aptitude—much like the spiritual roots of humans.  

The Skywing Tiger Clan wasn’t some formidable demon race; otherwise, they wouldn’t have been living in the Nine Nether Valley.  

After centuries of human hunting, this type of demon beast had become increasingly rare.  

After scouting the area, Xiao Ji told Qian Duoyu, "The Skywing Tiger Demon's den is near the mountain peak."  

The two of them ascended the mountain.  

When they found the tiger’s den, Xiao Ji inspected the interior and discovered the Tiger King wasn’t present. There were also signs of a struggle. Based on his analysis, the fight had occurred three days prior—meaning someone had arrived before them and already clashed with the tiger demons.  

Qian Duoyu wasn’t highly skilled in cultivation, nor did he seem particularly clever, but he wasn’t stupid either. He also noticed the traces of battle and asked Xiao Ji, "Brother Xiao, did we arrive too late?"  

"Indeed, we’re late," Xiao Ji replied. "Now, we can either leave, wait, or go inside and take a look."  

Qian Duoyu didn’t want to leave just like that. Even if he couldn’t taste the flesh of a Skywing Tiger Demon, he at least wanted to see what a living one looked like.  

He had seen Skywing Tiger Demons before—but only their pelts.  

Many cultivators, especially those with status—sect leaders, elders, even some stewards—would drape themselves in exotic demon beast hides to appear unique and refined. They turned them into rugs, cloaks, or backrests for decoration.  

"Let’s go inside and take a look. I’m quite curious about the living conditions of Skywing Tiger Demons," Qian Duoyu suggested.  

Xiao Ji realized this wealthy cultivator lived too comfortably, which made him overly curious—he wanted to taste everything and see every place.  

Of course, it was also because he had been confined to his home, forced to consume pills and cultivate all day.  

Looking closely at Qian Duoyu’s past life, how was it any different from imprisonment? He couldn’t even step outside without being accompanied by experts, let alone do anything private.  

After discussing, the two entered the tiger’s den.  

The cave was deep—narrow at first but gradually widening.  

"The stream here ensures the Skywing Tiger Clan has water. A fine cave, with a water source," Qian Duoyu remarked as he observed the surroundings, spotting many bones and a natural brook flowing outward.  

"Good caves are like this," Xiao Ji replied casually.  

The deepest part of the cave opened into a vast, empty space—cleaner than the rest, though the heavy scent of beasts lingered.  

"This must be where they sleep," Qian Duoyu said, satisfied with the sight before him. His curiosity had been satisfied.  

Xiao Ji said nothing, only frowning as he approached a pile of bones.  

[The last bloodline of the Skywing Tiger Clan is hidden within the bone pile. Its mother, to protect its life, knocked it unconscious with her claws before leading the remaining tigresses out to fight human cultivators.]  

"Doesn’t sound like a happy story," Xiao Ji murmured with a sigh.  

All creatures compete. Humans and demons had fought for countless years—humans slaying demons, demons devouring humans—an endless cycle.  

Yet in this process, tragic tales inevitably emerged.  

Take the scene before him: the last descendant of a demon species was hidden right in front of him. If he took one step forward, the Skywing Tiger Clan would be extinct.  

"Brother Xiao, why are you staring at a pile of bones? Thinking of bone soup?" Qian Duoyu joked, thinking himself witty.  

His attempt at humor didn’t amuse Xiao Ji—it only made him feel cold.  

"Weren’t you here to hunt a Skywing Tiger Demon?" Xiao Ji glanced at Qian Duoyu. "It’s hiding in there, though you might be disappointed… because there isn’t much meat on it."  

Xiao Ji hadn’t forgotten that Qian Duoyu had formed a team at Gossip Plaza to hunt Skywing Tiger Demons solely to taste their flesh.  

Hearing this, Qian Duoyu’s curiosity flared. Carefully, he cleared away the bones.  

Halfway through, he indeed found a tiny, kitten-like tiger cub, with two scar-like marks on its back.  

Those were the marks of the Skywing Tiger Clan’s pure bloodline. Once it reached a certain age and its Skywing blood awakened, wings would begin to grow.  

Qian Duoyu froze, unable to tear his eyes away from the cub. "How… how could I possibly eat this?"  

The cub was small, still asleep.  

Such a little thing wouldn’t even make a flavorful soup.  

He crouched down, lifting the tiny creature into his arms, clumsily stroking its fur.  

"Seems like this is the only tiger demon left here. I suppose the mission is complete," Xiao Ji said, watching Qian Duoyu. After all, the latter was the team leader and had promised a thousand Earth-grade spirit stones upon success.  

Xiao Ji hadn’t forgotten why he was here—he needed the funds to purchase a synthesized Foundation Establishment Pill.  

As long as he fulfilled the team leader’s goal, the spirit stones would be his.  

*"Mew~"*  

The cub woke up, slowly opening its eyes.  

It looked at Qian Duoyu without fear, letting out two more playful cries.  

"What’s it saying?" Qian Duoyu asked, flustered.  

"Probably that it’s hungry," Xiao Ji translated.  

"But I don’t have milk—what do I do?" Qian Duoyu panicked.  

"Oh, but you do," Xiao Ji said, pointing at the embroidered pouch hanging from Qian Duoyu’s waist. "That ‘Five Grains’ pouch of yours should be filled with all kinds of delicacies. If I’m right, there’s definitely a variety of beast milk inside."  

*How did you guess?* Qian Duoyu assumed Xiao Ji had simply deduced it, given that his storage artifact was embroidered with symbols of a bountiful harvest. "Ah, yes, I do."  

He retrieved a jar of beast milk and began feeding the cub spoon by spoon.  

After drinking its fill, the Skywing cub fell back asleep in Qian Duoyu’s arms, completely unguarded—as if those arms were the safest place in the world.  

"It thinks you’re its mother now," Xiao Ji observed. "Still want to eat it?"  

"I never wanted to eat it!" Qian Duoyu quickly defended, hugging the cub tighter as if afraid it might understand his words.
