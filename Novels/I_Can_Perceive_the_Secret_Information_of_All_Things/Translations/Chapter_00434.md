# Chapter 434: The Great Demon King's Little Magic Trick  

The truth proved that the Great Demon King had indeed performed a magic trick—only this one was far too cruel, for it was all too real.  

Take, for example, the classic "vanishing person" act. Had Xiao Ji obediently stepped into the box as instructed, what would have emerged would have been nothing but a spirit—his physical body would have vanished without a trace.  

In the end, it was indeed a magic trick, but a thoroughly dull and horrifying one.
