# Chapter Thirty-Five: Cycle

"How did Sun Shu turn into a ghoul? He appeared in the city multiple times before and was even cornered by the Zhang family once. Didn't they say the county yamen had a treasure that could suppress ghouls?" Chen Fei's mind raced, but unfortunately, there was no one who could give him answers.

"Is Sun Shu still there?"
"Yes, and he's indeed injured, but we need to act fast, or others might get the news and arrive soon."
"It's just Sun Shu. I owe you one for this favor!"
"I'll go back and wait for your good news!"

Faint voices suddenly drifted from ahead. Chen Fei's heart, which had just felt a surge of joy, suddenly realized something was wrong. Why did this conversation sound so familiar? When Chen Fei finally reached the front and saw the people in the distance, his scalp suddenly prickled with dread.

"What the hell!" Chen Fei almost cursed aloud. Before his eyes, Zhang Qiang, Zhang Yuezhen, and others were currently conversing. A line of guards followed behind Zhang Yuezhen, and at the very end of the group, Chen Fei even saw *himself*.

"Sun Shu, he's here! Kill him!" Zhang Yuezhen suddenly looked at Chen Fei and shouted loudly, her expression extremely excited. It wasn't just Zhang Yuezhen; those guards, and even Zhang Qiang, all looked at Chen Fei with bloodshot eyes.

Having narrowly escaped that terrifying scene, Chen Fei took a breath, contemplating the recent turn of events. "I have to go to the Zhang family. This matter is quite serious," he thought. The Zhang family was going to have a major headache because of this. If others in the medical hall hadn't seen Chen Fei leave with them, he would have actually wanted to avoid the whole thing. But too many people had witnessed it at the time; if Chen Fei tried to deny it, he would only appear more suspicious.

Chen Fei found an empty alley, slapped his own chest, and spat out a mouthful of blood. Then he forcefully slammed himself onto the ground, bruising his face badly. "That should be enough," Chen Fei stood up, grimacing. Returning without a single injury would be difficult to explain.

A quarter of an hour later, Chen Fei arrived at the Zhang family residence and met Zhang Sinan.

"What did you say? Everyone died!" Zhang Sinan shot to her feet upon hearing Chen Fei's words.

"That Sun Shu might have already turned into a ghoul." Chen Fei recounted most of what had happened, omitting only his conflict with Zhang Yuezhen. Zhang Sinan paced back and forth, her brows deeply furrowed. The deaths of the guards, though regrettable, weren't a significant loss to the Zhang family. But Zhang Yuezhen, a Bone Forging realm cultivator, dying was much harder to accept. Especially if Sun Shu had truly become a ghoul, the difficulty of resolving this matter had just escalated significantly. "Follow me!"

"If my movement technique hadn't been exceptional during this encounter with the ghoul, I might have died too. Therefore, no matter how much my movement technique is strengthened, it wouldn't be excessive."

"Alright!" Zhang Sinan glanced at Chen Fei, assuming he was shaken by the incident, and nodded in agreement.

"Could I choose again, like last time?"

"Fine!" Zhang Sinan frowned slightly, showing some impatience, but didn't refuse. She summoned her personal maid, Dan Xiang, and instructed her to take her personal token to retrieve the secret manuals. Meanwhile, Zhang Sinan herself went to seek out the various elders of the Zhang family, one by one.

After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, in Zhang Sinan's courtyard.

"Three movement technique secret manuals. Miss said you have a quarter of an hour to make your choice!" Dan Xiang looked at Chen Fei with a hint of disdain. Zhang Yuezhen had died, yet Chen Fei had managed to return alive; it simply made no sense.

"A quarter of an hour?"
