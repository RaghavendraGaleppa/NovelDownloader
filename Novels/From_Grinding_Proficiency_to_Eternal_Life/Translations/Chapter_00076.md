# Chapter 76: Cultivation

“Wuzhou isn't too far from Qingzhou. From the state capital of Changyi in Qingzhou, it's just over thirty-five hundred li to the Tian Chan Sect at Mount Thunder Accumulation. Once you get there, as long as you show this token, they'll naturally accept you as a disciple. The Tian Chan Qi is the most balanced and peaceful. No matter how muddled and chaotic your internal blood energy is, like a vat of mixed dyes, it can be refined into a single golden elixir.

The day you shed your golden cicada shell, the Three Unifications may not be far off…”

Xu Yunfan took the item and looked it over. The copper token was worn smooth and shiny from being handled so much.

Liu Tianyun then added with some helplessness, “The Incense Fire Sect is causing chaos in Wuzhou now, so the journey will be arduous and the road long. Those madmen from the Incense Fire Sect are blocking the main roads in Wuzhou. If they see anyone carrying a sword, they'll gouge out their eyes and剖 their hearts to offer to their so-called Ming Lord. If you're truly determined to go, be careful along the way. I'll be setting off back to North Ye City soon.”

Xu Yunfan smiled. “It's a path I must take nonetheless. Thank you, Brother Liu!”

There was only half a pot of wine left, and Xu Yunfan didn't bother to be stingy. The two of them drank it all.

When they parted ways, Liu Tianyun watched Xu Yunfan's swaying figure as he rode off on his horse, his expression somewhat complicated. There wasn't a trace of drunkenness in Xu Yunfan's demeanor.

“Master, your disciple is unfilial. I have found a promising talent now. Though his personality is cold, he is trustworthy and honors his promises… I hope this can lessen your prejudice against me, and that he may bring glory to our sect's name.”

Xu Yunfan rode his horse around the corner, and his slightly swaying body immediately straightened. He was deep in thought, carefully recalling Liu Tianyun's words.

At the wine table just now, he had deliberately gotten Liu Tianyun drunk to fish for some useful information.

Unfortunately, Liu Tianyun had been very tight-lipped. He only spoke of the Tian Chan Sect's origins and didn't say much else, simply telling Xu Yunfan he would understand once he arrived.

Wuzhou…

He would wait until he had perfected the Iron Bridge Suppression Bone Refining Chapter before setting out.

Later, when he obtained bone-refining techniques that could be practiced to perfection, he would stack and cultivate them. He had also picked up the Shocking Wave Palm again and practiced it from time to time, and his progress was extremely fast.

Returning to the rented courtyard, Xu Yunfan pulled two copper tokens from his chest: one for 'Divine Weapon' and one for 'Tian Chan'.

He hadn't spent these past few months running around for nothing. The Divine Weapon Ridge borders the area between Wuzhou and Qingzhou. Thirty years ago, a top-tier expert used a divine weapon to smash half the mountain range of the Divine Weapon Ridge, causing it to decline ever since. Even the martial arts that led directly to the Marrow Cleansing Master level were snatched away.

The Great Zhou Imperial Court must have secretly put in a lot of effort back then; otherwise, how would the Divine Weapon Ridge's Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer technique have ended up in the Great Zhou Imperial Treasury for Li Haomiao to know about?

Nowadays, the Divine Weapon Ridge doesn't even have a forging master who can craft divine weapons. It has become like the Hundred Refinements Manor, capable only of forging sharp blades and precious artifacts, which is considered quite good.

Still, since he's decided to go, he'll take a look and then make a plan.

Although he's been rushing about outside these days, he hasn't slacked off for a moment. Whenever he has free time, he practices martial arts.

Not to mention the Flying Leg and Cloak Hammer techniques, just the Iron Bridge Suppression Bone Refining Chapter alone is close to being perfected by him.

In less than a month, the Iron Bridge Suppression Bone Refining Chapter will surely enter the Great Completion realm.

The next morning, before the morning mist had fully dissipated, Xu Yunfan was already standing in the center of the courtyard.

He was shirtless, his muscle lines as sharp as if carved by a knife, his skin glowing with a bronze luster in the morning light.

He held the Drum-Pounding瓮-Golden Hammer in his hands, the hammer heads carved with ferocious beast patterns, the handles wrapped in sweat-soaked hemp rope.

He took a deep breath, and the blood energy within him surged like a river, flowing through his entire body along his flesh and blood.

The muscles on his arms suddenly tensed, blue veins bulging like coiled dragons.

He swung the twin hammers violently. The wind from the hammers howled, kicking up fallen leaves and dust on the ground, forming a small whirlwind.

The hammer shadows were like crimson lightning, drawing sharp arcs in the air. Each strike carried thousands of pounds of force, making the air vibrate with a humming sound.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

The hammer heads smashed onto the bluestone slabs in the courtyard, which cracked and shattered instantly, fragments flying everywhere. Xu Yunfan's movements grew faster and faster, the hammer shadows almost merging into one, like a crimson cloak dancing around him.

*You repeatedly practice the Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer, understanding every move and form deeply. Your mind resonates with the rhythm of the hammer techniques. Proficiency in Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer has increased.*

*You continuously swing the Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer. Every hammer strike aligns with your own heartbeat rhythm. Your body and the hammer technique merge into one. Power surges from the soles of your feet to your arms. Through the exhilarating hammer strikes, your mastery of the Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer becomes more adept, and your proficiency increases significantly.*

*...*

After finishing the routine, Xu Yunfan's blood energy was as scalding as boiling water. The sweat flowing from his body was vaporized by the high temperature emanating from within him, creating steam that enveloped him.

After a morning of practice, the Cloak Hammer's proficiency had only increased by six or seven points.

The text appearing in his mind made him frown slightly. At this pace, it would still take at least half a year to perfect the Cloak Hammer.

The well water in the bathing tub was quickly boiled by his extremely high body temperature caused by his highly active blood energy. Xu Yunfan simply scooped up a ladle of cold water and poured it over his head.

“Master Xu, your breakfast has arrived.”

A servant's voice came from outside the courtyard, followed by the light sound of a food box opening.

Xu Yunfan put on a single garment and pushed the door open. A rich aroma greeted him.

In the rosewood food box, plates of delicacies were arranged neatly. The most eye-catching was the plate of exotic beast meat in the center, taken from the Qingzhou-specific 'Red-Scaled Beast'. The meat was as red as blood, with faint golden threads between the textures. This single plate cost fifty taels of silver.

Just that one plate of exotic beast meat was worth fifty taels.

It takes a poor scholar to cultivate literature, but a rich man to practice martial arts.

He remembered that in North Ye City, a single meal could easily cost a hundred taels or more. Now he's being more frugal, but this table still costs a staggering sixty taels.

Ordinary people toil for a whole year to save up a dozen or so taels of silver, while his single meal equals their savings for several years.

Of course, most martial artists wouldn't spend money as recklessly as Xu Yunfan does. With sixty taels of silver, one could buy medicinal herbs to brew Qi-replenishing soup and body-strengthening pills, which, if used sparingly, would be enough for one or two months of supply.

They wouldn't be like Xu Yunfan, treating money like dirt.

He needs to save some!

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly while picking up his chopsticks, his expression invigorated. The fatigue from his morning martial practice seemed to lessen a bit.

Let's eat!

Life is all about eating and drinking.

After resting at noon, Xu Yunfan stood in a mountain hollow outside the city.

His legs bent slightly, his soles pressed tightly against the ground, sensing the pulse from below. Blood energy surged into his legs, his muscles compressed like springs, accumulating astonishing power.

Xu Yunfan suddenly exerted force, his figure shooting out like an arrow released from a bow. Deep footprints were left on the ground where his soles had stepped.

His speed was so fast that his figure was almost invisible, only the sound of wind whistling in his ears.

His legs alternately kicked off the ground, each step carrying explosive power, leaving shallow pits in the ground and sending dust flying.

Blood energy surged within his legs, his muscles continuously strengthened during the rapid movement, and the blood vessels under his skin pulsed faintly, as if countless tiny flames were burning.
