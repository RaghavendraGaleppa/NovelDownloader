# Chapter 45: Elder Hanhè Let Out a Sharp Roar

Li Mo put forth all his strength. The good news was, he did manage to budge the Calamity Meteorite Hammer. The bad news was, he could only move it a tiny bit. This was still the Calamity Meteorite Hammer ‘condescending’ to cooperate with him to the utmost. That tiny movement was likely the divine weapon leveraging his force to move itself.

“This hammer isn’t very big, but it’s terrifyingly heavy,” Li Mo sighed, releasing his grip. “I can effortlessly lift a Spined Turtle now; my strength probably exceeds ten thousand catties.”

Fortunately, he hadn’t planned on picking it up by himself anyway. If he could move it, this divine weapon wouldn’t have been left at the bottom of Divine Edge Cave, where sunlight never reached.

No matter. He still had a cheat. “World Seed. I can now imbue myself with a small portion of its power. The duration is very short; I need to be fast…”

Li Mo hadn’t come alone. Behind him was an entire world. Though this world had only just been born, fragile and chaotic as it was. Still, it was a world, after all.

*Crack! Pop!*

The instant he was imbued with the World Seed’s power, his bones crackled like popping beans, his vital energy surged and roared within him, and his thirteen main meridians swelled like furious dragons soaring through the sky. An endless, surging power seemed to flow through him.

Li Mo even had the illusion that if Divine Edge Mountain had a handle he could grasp, he could lift the entire mountain. “Rise!”

*Boom!*

A hammer’s roar, a hundred times louder than before, exploded. The Calamity Meteorite Hammer. After thousands of years, it was once again grasped in someone’s palm.

It was only for a fleeting moment. Li Mo quickly collected it into his small world. Then, as if all strength had drained from him, he collapsed onto the ground, not even wanting to move a finger, letting his sweat pool around him.

“Fortunately… fortunately, a divine weapon isn’t considered a life form,” he panted. “Otherwise, I really wouldn’t have been able to pull it into my small world. I actually just picked up a divine weapon!”

Young Li’s chest heaved like a bellows, and his eyes saw stars. All sorts of chaotic thoughts incessantly burst forth. Using power that wasn’t his own had an immense backlash; if it had lasted even one more breath, his physical body might have begun to collapse. But in the end, he had succeeded…

Li Mo’s consciousness faded, and he felt waves of drowsiness wash over him. Just as he was about to fall asleep, he heard an aged, sharp roar. Somewhat familiar… Was it Elder Hanhè?

***

Night fell. On Divine Edge Peak, within the Elder’s residence. One could see various iron materials and semi-finished weapons scattered all around; it looked less like an Elder’s home and more like an armory.

“Where’s the hammer?!” “Where is the Founding Ancestor’s weapon of my Divine Edge Peak?!”

Looking at the unconscious Young Li, who was lying there snoring, Elder Hanhè paced back and forth, questioning his life. The always composed elder was now utterly distraught.

“Stop grumbling,” Shang Wu said, crossing her legs, a hint of her leg visible beneath her palace robes, one hand propping up her chin. “You’re going to annoy me to death. Tsk, that brat of a disciple is sleeping so soundly. We were supposed to have roast lamb today…”

“What time is it, and you’re still thinking about food?!” Elder Hanhè’s “three corpse gods” leaped, and he trembled with rage. “That’s a divine weapon! Divine Edge Peak gets its name from it! If it’s gone, even if I die, I’ll have no face to meet the Ancestor!”

If Shang Wu hadn’t been there, he would have long since rushed over and shaken Li Mo awake. “No one can use it anyway; it was just gathering dust there,” Shang Wu muttered, narrowing her eyes in displeasure. “Also, speak properly. Why so loud? Do you think I’m deaf?”

Hanhè: “…” What heinous deeds had this old man committed in his previous life, to encounter this master-disciple pair in this one?

“Mmm… mmm?” Just then, on the bed, the “certain Li” who had slept for most of the day let out a yawn and seemed to wake up. He groggily opened his eyes.
