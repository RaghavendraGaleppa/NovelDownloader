## Chapter 107: Entering the Banner

Although he had tricked the leyline from Patriarch Tingyou, Lu Yang had no intention of stopping. After all, the other party still held a batch of his witch-ghosts. Coincidentally, the Ten Thousand Spirit Banner was recently short-staffed.

"The industrial production line for the Ten Thousand Spirit Banner's talismans has been restarted recently, and some banner spirits have exhausted their spirituality and self-destructed. It's about time to recruit the next batch." Anyway, essentially, they were all the same batch of witch-ghosts. Instead of wasting time resting witch-ghosts that were too spiritually exhausted to work, it was better to directly replace them with new ones. Moreover, the replaced witch-ghosts could be fed directly to the new witch-ghosts, achieving waste utilization and resource recycling, allowing the new witch-ghosts to enter work in better condition, improving talisman production efficiency, completing industrial scale upgrades, and achieving sustainable exploitation.

The subsequent developments were largely the same as in Lu Yang's previous previous life. Without him, True Man Yinshan indeed chose Zhao Xuhe. After a chaotic battle, the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm was successfully roused by True Man Yinshan and chose to emerge. Then, the Core Formation sword qi dissipated, and the [Heavenly Corpse Malice] was taken by True Man Yinshan. In return, Zhao Xuhe received a Heaven Ascension Token bestowed by True Man Yinshan, becoming even more complacent, as if he could already see the day he would establish his Foundation.

However, Lu Yang paid no attention to any of this. In this life, he had always remained hidden in the shadows, only coming to the depths of Skeleton Mountain after True Man Yinshan had left, then releasing the aura of the [Yama Hall].

Moments later, a black shadow quietly appeared.

"Greetings, Patriarch!" Lu Yang, while showing an excited expression and bowing respectfully, silently sensed Patriarch Tingyou's aura, biding his time, ready to turn hostile at any moment.

"...Rise." Patriarch Tingyou, after possessing a new body, appeared at first glance as a handsome youth with red lips and white teeth. Although his tone was mature, his voice was extremely youthful. He watched Lu Yang with a solemn expression, seemingly deep in thought. After a long pause, he sighed faintly: "Bring out your Guardian Spirit."

Lu Yang was startled to hear this, but he didn't hesitate. He immediately took out the Ten Thousand Spirit Banner, summoned Su Nu, and simultaneously prepared to strike if anything seemed amiss.

"Hmm?" Patriarch Tingyou seemed not to notice Lu Yang's unusual behavior. His gaze immediately fell upon Lu Yang's Ten Thousand Spirit Banner. After examining it for a moment, he couldn't help but exclaim in praise: "What a magnificent treasure! It's not a spirit treasure, yet it surpasses one. It perfectly matches my Witch-Ghost Dao tradition; it's like adding wings to a tiger!"

"You flatter me, Patriarch. This item is called the Ten Thousand Spirit Banner." Lu Yang smiled faintly at his words: "This junior obtained it through a fortuitous encounter. It's also thanks to this wondrous treasure that this junior was able to pass down the sect's legacy."

Patriarch Tingyou nodded upon hearing this: "Good. I was originally concerned about how you would house the myriad witch-ghosts of our sect and was thinking of helping you, but it seems I don't need to worry now."

Then he looked at Su Nu, his brow slightly furrowed: "Your Guardian Spirit is well-crafted, but unfortunately, it only possesses craftsmanship without adaptability. In the past, the [Yama Hall] was custom-made by me for myself. Since you are primarily using this Guardian Spirit, you should learn to adapt to circumstances." With that, he formed a hand seal with his right hand and silently performed some calculations for a moment.

Not long after, Patriarch Tingyou reopened his eyes and cast a spell, which directly landed on Su Nu and her [Yama Hall].

Rumble! The next second, a divine ability light rose from beneath Su Nu's feet. Within the light, seven ancient seal characters, [Yama Heaven, Dark Nether, Soul-Seizing Prefect], successively emerged. However, as Patriarch Tingyou's spell changed, the appearance of these characters gradually transformed:

[By Imperial Decree, Nine Nether Primordial Maiden Empress of Su Yin]!

With the change in characters, the divine ability was complete. Su Nu's aura suddenly surged, recovering to fifty percent of her previous life's level even without the leyline's enhancement! With further leyline enhancement, she could even surpass her previous life!

"Now it's better." Patriarch Tingyou smiled contentedly at the sight: "With such a Foundation Establishment Guardian Spirit, you will have even greater hope of advancing to Foundation Establishment and reopening the sect in the future." With that, he took out a transparent black sphere. Inside, there were precisely the myriad witch-ghosts from the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm. Lu Yang even saw a slowly flowing murky stream within it, and as the former master of Skeleton Mountain in his previous life, he immediately recognized what it was.

"The [Heavenly Corpse Malice]!?" True Man Yinshan didn't take it... no, that's not right. He took *one* of them, but there was more than one Heavenly Corpse Malice within Skeleton Mountain's leyline!

"This malice is a product of yin earth, a terrestrial evil belonging to [Zhi Xu]. It can gather fire and nourish metal. If you are diligent, you can use this terrestrial evil to break through to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment in the future. If a powerful enemy invades, you can also detonate it to destroy the eight hundred li of Skeleton Mountain's leylines and perish together with the enemy."

Lu Yang knew all of this. However, in his previous life, Patriarch Tingyou had only left these words as a thought in his soul, whereas in this life, he had personally explained them in detail.

'Is he... entrusting his legacy to me?' Lu Yang was somewhat puzzled. To be honest, he had originally thought that Patriarch Tingyou's attitude towards this suddenly appearing 'successor' would not be particularly good. After all, he was the sect master of the Witch-Ghost Dao. Now, having lived his fifth life and with great hope of returning to Foundation Establishment, he should have been ambitious and unwilling to see anything out of his control. But now, it seemed not to be the case.

Just then, Patriarch Tingyou suddenly stopped speaking, glanced at Lu Yang, and then smiled: "Whatever you want to say, just say it."

Lu Yang quickly denied: "Patriarch, you've misunderstood—"

Patriarch Tingyou waved his hand: "You've managed to make a name for yourself in the Sacred Sect; do you think I wouldn't guess what you're thinking? It would be truly strange if you *did* trust me!" With that, he shook his head with a bitter expression: "My lifespan in this life is not long. My original intention was to escape the secret realm and then head overseas, find an isolated island, and pass on the lineage of my Witch-Ghost Dao. If there could be another Foundation Establishment cultivator to oversee it, that would be even better. Now that I have you, it has saved me a lot of effort. Since you've managed to cultivate to this level in the Sacred Sect and are still alive, I am confident in your abilities. After all, what I seek in the latter half of my life is nothing more than the sect's legacy."

As his words fell, Patriarch Tingyou's expression gradually returned to calm. He looked at Lu Yang and said indifferently: "Alright, send me into your Ten Thousand Spirit Banner."

Lu Yang was immediately stunned to hear this: "...Patriarch, you want to enter the Banner?"

"I am a sinner of the sect. If I had not acted so recklessly back then, the sect would not have suffered such a great catastrophe. Throughout my remaining life, I have been trying to atone for my past mistakes. Since that is the case, I should naturally contribute my final effort to the sect." With that, Patriarch Tingyou smiled again: "Besides, this way you'll also feel more at ease, right?"

"...Then this junior will respectfully obey." Lu Yang didn't argue. He immediately activated the Ten Thousand Spirit Banner, opening a chaotic void. Patriarch Tingyou nodded at the sight and stepped in without hesitation.

Whoosh, whoosh—! The next second, Lu Yang lifted the banner pole and slammed it heavily onto the ground. A dull roar accompanied the shadows as they rapidly expanded in all directions.

Boom! Wherever the shadow passed, the [Yama Hall] reopened, from which countless armed Underworld soldiers and ghost generals emerged, surrounding Lu Yang like stars orbiting the moon. The witch-ghosts varied in strength, clearly categorized from early Qi Condensation, to middle Qi Condensation, to late Qi Condensation, and even Great Perfection, lined up in orderly formations, resembling a true army. Not to mention there were super-grade banner spirits like the Soul Avatar of the Heaven-Mending Peak Master, Patriarch Tingyou, and the Guardian Spirit Su Nu.

Undoubtedly, this spirit treasure had become even more terrifying! Furthermore, having been 'purified' by the [Book of Hundred Lifetimes], Lu Yang no longer had to worry about any troublesome karmic entanglements on it and could use it with bold confidence!

"...It's time." The next second, Lu Yang no longer concealed himself. His baleful aura shot straight into the sky, instantly startling the entire Skeleton Mountain! Almost simultaneously, True Man Yinshan, who had just collected the [Heavenly Corpse Malice] and was about to leave, turned back in astonishment, looking towards the direction where the baleful aura soared into the sky. However, at this moment, he couldn't see a single person. All he saw was a [Yama Hall] as majestic as a mountain, perched in the sky, absorbing terrestrial evil, with banners fluttering in the midst of myriad witch-ghosts!
