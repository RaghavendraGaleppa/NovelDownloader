# Chapter 316: The Scheme

He suddenly realized he had made a fatal mistake. This second-ranked true disciple, who had emerged victorious from the arena of the Thirty-Six Peaks, possessed eyes that seemed gentle yet could pierce through his three layers of inner garments and see the sweat-soaked spine beneath.

"Brother Chen seems somewhat impatient. Why don't we ask him clearly before deciding what to do with him?"

A smile involuntarily formed on Chen Hong's face.

"Brother Xu... you are right to educate me. This junior brother was indeed too impatient..."

Xu Yunfan lowered his eyelids, ignoring Chen Hong's hesitant expression, and turned his gaze toward Jiang Jingguo.

This sword pavilion true disciple, dressed like a scholar, now had a ferocious expression. His originally handsome features were twisted into a venomous grimace, and the hatred radiating from his eyes made the temperature on the third floor drop by three degrees.

The chilling aura seeping from between his teeth, combined with his trembling fingertips, made him look like a fierce beast ready to devour someone.

"Have we met?"

Xu Yunfan's fingers gently gripped the bluish-black mouth of the撼岳镇海锤 (Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer). The dark patterns on the hammer's body flickered as his Qi surged.

Jiang Jingguo suddenly let out a sharp, owl-like laugh.

"Xu Yunfan, you are too arrogant. Someone will deal with you. Without the Dao Sect, you are nothing. Jade Capital City is not a place you can come and go as you please."

With that, Jiang Jingguo's face turned pale, his head slumped to one side, and he fell completely silent.

Dead?!

Xu Yunfan's brows furrowed sharply. His knuckles tapped the mouth of the Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer, producing a clear, resonant chime. This sword pavilion true disciple had actually used the "Broken Jade Technique" to sever his own heart meridian. Such a fierce act of mutual destruction was unexpected even for Xu Yunfan, who had experienced countless battles.

Chen Hong's expression changed slightly. He quickly stepped forward, checked the breath, felt the pulse, and turned back with a heavy expression.

"Brother Xu... he is dead."

"My son!!!"

A heart-wrenching cry of grief erupted from downstairs. The sound wave, accompanied by sharp Qi, shattered all the railings on the third floor.

A grey shadow stepped up into the air like a ghost. Wherever it passed, the wooden stairs exploded into pieces.

The newcomer had white hair bristling like spears, and the long sword in his hand emitted a piercing green light.

A Dao Sect disciple beside him changed expression. "That's Jiang Tianyang, the Third Elder of the Sword Pavilion. A master at the visceral refinement realm."

When the old man's withered fingers touched Jiang Jingguo's still-warm brow, the entire tavern suddenly fell into an eerie silence.

He tremblingly moved his hand from his son's neck. Seeing the broken sword fragment clutched in Jiang Jingguo's hand, he gently picked it up, and Jiang Tianyang's lips trembled.

The moment the sword fragment turned to dust in his palm, the surrounding lanterns suddenly went out. Only the twelve blood grooves on the blade of the old man's sword lit up one by one with a scarlet glow.

"A fine... true disciple of the Dao Sect!"

Each word from Jiang Tianyang seemed to be crushed out from between his teeth. His face, covered with age spots, was now as ferocious as a demon.

His hunched body suddenly straightened, and seven long sword shadows formed by Qi appeared behind him.

"Seven Kill Sword?!"

One of the Sword Pavilion's secret martial arts, renowned throughout the martial world.

In recent days, he had indeed crammed knowledge of various sects.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained as calm as an ancient well. His gaze only allocated three parts to the maddened Jiang Tianyang, while the remaining seven parts scanned every corner of the surrounding buildings of the Changfeng Tavern like a hawk.

"A fine consecutive scheme. What a grand design."

He pressed his tongue against his palate, sneering silently. The timing of Jiang Jingguo's suicide and Jiang Tianyang's appearance was too perfect.

Three hundred zhang away, a three-story waterside pavilion with upturned eaves stood quietly on the bank of a tributary of the Jade River. Its style of green tiles and red railings was indistinguishable from the thousands of official waterside pavilions in the city.

From this tricky angle that could just peek into the third floor of the Changfeng Tavern, the carved window lattices were half-drawn with bamboo curtains, and the copper bells on the eaves remained motionless in the twilight.

No one would suspect that this viewing platform, seamlessly integrated with the surrounding buildings, currently housed several figures whose presence was retracted to the extreme.

Inside the waterside pavilion, aloeswood incense curled. Several figures were hidden in the mottled light and shadow cast by the bamboo curtains.

One of them, a yin柔 (soft/yin) man, lightly tapped his bluish-green jade tea cup. Inside the cup, faint ripples of Qi from the direction of the Changfeng Tavern were reflected.

"Brother Chen, do you think Xu Yunfan can withstand Jiang Tianyang?"

The yin柔 man's voice was like silk soaked in ice water.

Chen Yu stroked the jade beads in his hand. Amidst the sound of jade beads colliding, a sneer was mixed in.

"From the inside information from the Dao Sect, this person, at the marrow cleansing realm, defeated several visceral refinement realm disciples... even Chu Cangming was defeated by him."

He turned his words: "However, the arena is not a matter of life and death. Jiang Tianyang has been immersed in the visceral refinement realm for a life cycle of sixty years. In a battle of life and death, I wonder if Xu Yunfan can withstand it."

"Bang!"

The black-robed man in the northeast corner nodded. "The arena is ultimately not a place for life and death! Jiang Tianyang touched the threshold of turning visceral Qi into Qi Gang sixty years ago. With the resources of the Jiang family over the years, he has probably cultivated the 'Sword Pavilion Secret Manual' to the 'Turning into Rainbow' realm!"

"Interesting."

A hoarse female voice came from the window. Half a face scarred by burns was visible under a silver mask. "I bet three Dragon Tiger Golden Pills that Xu Yunfan won't last thirty breaths."

She flicked the tobacco pipe in her hand. "Back then, this old dog used the Seven Kill Sword technique to kill three masters who had fully mastered the visceral refinement realm in Xuankong State. The spectacle was grand and attracted the attention of the martial world."

The hunchbacked old man, who had remained silent, suddenly spoke.

"Xu Yunfan is a genius. A genius among geniuses. He reached the marrow realm in two years."

The youth in brocade clothes in the darkest place suddenly chuckled. He was toying with a bronze waist badge unique to the Jiang family's servants. The number "Bing Xu 76" on the badge was precisely Xu Yunfan's identity badge from his time at the Jiang family.

"This time won't do, there's next time. Next time won't do, there's the time after that. There will always be a time when he is caught off guard and dies on the spot."

***

The third floor of the Changfeng Tavern had become ruins.

Jiang Tianyang's withered body suddenly tensed. The seven illusory sword shadows behind him condensed into substance. The twelve blood grooves on the Broken Jade Sword emitted a piercing scarlet glow.

He took a step forward. The floorboards of the third floor of the Changfeng Tavern exploded one by one. Spiderweb-like cracks spread from the column bases to the load-bearing beams, which groaned under the strain.

"Seven Kill, Soul Slaying!"

Before the sword tip arrived, the chilling sword Qi had already transformed into seven blood-colored pythons, tearing through the air to bite.

Xu Yunfan's feet sank three inches into the ground. The Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer blocked in front of him. The dark patterns on the hammer body lit up with the shadow of a mountain.

When the first strand of sword Qi struck the hammer face, the muscles in his forearm twisted tight like steel wire. Pure Yang True Qi condensed into a crimson-gold flow pattern beneath his skin, forcibly shattering the sword Qi.

The shockwave swept out. The carved screen in the next room split in two with a "crack."

The opponent's force was a bit light!

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly.

Jiang Tianyang's sword stance changed abruptly. The second sword, "Breaking the Army," swept up from bottom to top. Where the sword tip passed, the air actually condensed frost crystals.

Xu Yunfan's expression did not change at all. He sank his waist and turned his hips, the two hammers overlapping and smashing down. The moment the hammer and sword collided, his shoulder blades made a sound like a bowstring snapping. It was precisely the "Mountain Breaking Stance" of the "Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method."

The Qi wave exploded. The Eight Immortals table between the two collapsed with a bang. Wood shards, like arrows, embedded themselves into the surrounding beams and pillars.
