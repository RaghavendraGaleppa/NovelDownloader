## Chapter 2 Zhao Di

Over a decade later.

In a large canyon on Mount Nanhua, perpetually shrouded in dense clouds, a sudden gust of wind, appearing from nowhere, whistled through, dispersing the thick mists in some areas. This created a narrow path, about ten feet wide, leading directly from the depths of the fog-covered canyon to its outer exit. From this vantage point, looking into the canyon, one could see two figures emerging one after another.

"Isn't it just a broken cultivation family as small as a sesame seed? Isn't it just one Qi Gathering Powder every month? What's so rare about that! Once I'm gone, I'm never coming back!"

The one walking ahead was a fifteen or sixteen-year-old boy, tall and somewhat thin, with a rather delicate appearance. He wore a wrinkled, slightly yellowed white tunic, and at his waist hung a small leather pouch, seemingly made from the hide of some rare beast. As he walked, the boy quietly cursed the group of people who had driven him out of the canyon. Perhaps he was afraid of being overheard, as the curses were likely only audible to himself.

Trailing behind him was a sweet-faced little girl with a round face and snow-white skin. Her two pigtails, adorned with colorful flowers, and the childlike innocence in her brows clearly revealed her young age. At that moment, she was pouting, her normally dark and bright eyes slightly red and brimming with watery tears, looking as if they could spill over at any moment.

"Brother Wugen, are you really leaving? What if I go and plead with the Grand Elder to let you stay? You're so talented at talisman crafting; the family surely needs you." The little girl slowly followed the boy, finally gathering the courage to speak.

"No need, Xin'er. My cultivation won't make any progress if I stay in the Jian family. It's better to go out and explore; maybe I'll find some peerless spiritual medicine that will greatly advance my cultivation. I'll definitely return once my cultivation is complete, and don't you get lazy, or your cultivation might fall behind mine then." The boy curled his lip, making a teasing expression at the girl.

"Who would lose to you, you annoying fellow!" The girl's pout deepened.

"Go back quickly, we're almost at the exit, I'm leaving!" The boy suddenly sped up, running a few steps and bursting out of the canyon mouth, leaving the girl standing there in a daze.

The girl watched the boy's retreating figure for a long time before lowering her head with a sigh and turning to walk back into the depths of the thick fog.

"Brother Wugen, you must come back soon."

...

This boy was precisely Zhao Di, or "Wugen."

Zhao Di was his previous name. He had originally been a scholar in his early twenties from the Great Tang Kingdom, spending his days diligently studying in a small mountain hut. One day, finding the night particularly beautiful, he stepped out of his study to admire it and was inexplicably struck by a meteor-like ball of light.

That was his last memory. He only remembered a sudden flash of light before losing consciousness.

He didn't know how much time had passed—perhaps decades, perhaps merely a dream during an afternoon nap, or perhaps several cycles of reincarnation. His consciousness finally reawakened, but he found himself transformed into a newborn infant. What was worse, he had no idea where he was, and there was no one around.

Moreover, even before Zhao Di knew who his "birth parents" were, he was taken into the great canyon of Mount Nanhua by Jian Han, a low-level cultivator from the Jian family, and raised by a cultivation family known as the "Nanhua Jian Family." During this process, Zhao Di finally learned the local language and, through constant inquiry, gained some understanding of this new world.

This place was called the Tianyuan Continent. It was not at all on the land he had previously inhabited. All he knew was that the Tianyuan Continent was an incredibly vast existence; how vast exactly, no one in the Jian family knew, nor could anyone clearly describe it. To describe this continent in one phrase: vast land, sparse population. Of course, "sparse population" was relative; because the Tianyuan Continent was so enormous, even with a low population density, its total population was still immense.

On this continent, humans could be divided into two types: ordinary mortals, and cultivators, also known as immortal cultivators, who possessed spiritual roots and could practice cultivation. The latter group constituted an extremely small proportion, less than one in a thousand. Moreover, they mostly lived in seclusion in sacred cultivation lands, generally not entering the mortal world, and certainly not participating in its wars or power transitions. Consequently, the vast majority of mortals were completely unaware of the existence of cultivators.

As for what spiritual roots, which differentiated mortals from cultivators, truly were, no one in the Jian family could give a clear explanation. They only said that spiritual roots were innate, and only those who possessed them could sense the spiritual energy present in the heavens and earth, draw it into their bodies, and cultivate. It was rumored that the highest realm of cultivation allowed one to ascend to immortality, possessing boundless magic power and eternal youth.

Mortals without spiritual roots could not sense the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, let alone cultivate immortality. Furthermore, the chance of a mortal's offspring possessing spiritual roots was less than one in ten thousand. However, if one parent was a cultivator, the chance of their offspring having spiritual roots greatly increased. If both parents were cultivators, the probability of their descendants possessing spiritual roots could even reach between one-fourth and one-half. Thus, cultivators intermarried, forming various cultivation families and sects of all sizes.

The Nanhua Jian Family was a small cultivation family located in the Golden Flame Kingdom, in the southeastern part of the Tianyuan Continent. Their main sphere of influence encompassed the Mount Nanhua mountain range, spanning over three thousand *li*. They were one of the cultivation forces in Gun Prefecture, one of the Golden Flame Kingdom's thirteen prefectures.

According to Jian Han, during a journey back to Mount Nanhua after completing a family mission, he passed through a desolate wilderness where he surprisingly discovered a sleeping infant, who moreover possessed a spiritual root. Out of curiosity, he searched for half a day, but found no other figures within a radius of over ten *li*. He had no choice but to take the infant back to the Jian family.

This infant was Zhao Di. When he was brought into the Jian family, it happened to be when the Jian family was actively searching for infants with spiritual roots to expand their ranks. Thus, he was raised by the Jian family and became a member. No one gave him a formal name; he only had the nickname "Wugen" (Five Roots).

This was because Zhao Di's spiritual root was a mixed five-element spiritual root, possessing all five attributes—Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—making it the worst aptitude among all spiritual root types.

Spiritual roots are typically divided into five attributes: Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, collectively known as the Five Elements. Most cultivators' spiritual roots are composed of one or a mixture of these five attributes. Generally speaking, the fewer types of attributes a spiritual root contains, the purer it is, making it easier to sense the corresponding spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and allowing for faster absorption and cultivation. Mixed spiritual roots with four or five attributes are particularly difficult to cultivate and are also called mixed spiritual roots or pseudo spiritual roots, belonging to the category of very poor aptitude.

In contrast, spiritual roots with a single attribute possess extremely high cultivation talent and incredibly fast cultivation speeds, often allowing one to reach very high realms. These are known as Heavenly Spirit Roots, signifying a favored child of heaven. However, the appearance of such Heavenly Spirit Roots is exceedingly rare. Not to mention a small cultivation family like the Jian family, even in the Golden Flame Kingdom where the Jian family is located, which boasts over a thousand cultivation families and sects of various sizes, a Heavenly Spirit Root only appears once every few centuries. Furthermore, once a Heavenly Spirit Root appears, it immediately becomes an object of contention among cultivation forces. Having a Heavenly Spirit Root cultivator is equivalent to securing a future unparalleled master for one's sect, ensuring the sect's strength remains exceptionally stable for a long time. It is rumored that over thousands of years, the few Heavenly Spirit Root cultivators in the Golden Flame Kingdom, apart from those who died prematurely due to assassination by enemies, all cultivated to realms unimaginable to ordinary cultivators.

Besides these Five-Element spiritual roots, there are also some mutated spiritual roots, such as the Lightning Spirit Root, which is a mutation and sublimation of Gold and Water attributes; the Wind Spirit Root, which is a mutation of Earth and Fire attributes; and also Ice Spirit Roots, Illusion Spirit Roots, and others, all referred to as Variant Spirit Roots. The chances of these spiritual roots appearing are slightly higher than those of Heavenly Spirit Roots. Although cultivators with Variant Spirit Roots may not cultivate as fast as those with Heavenly Spirit Roots, they are still significantly ahead of other cultivators. Especially when cultivating corresponding special techniques, their strength is often much higher than other cultivators of the same level.

Although Zhao Di also possessed a spiritual root, it was the worst kind. Naturally, the Jian family had no high hopes for him from a young age, and they were even too lazy to bother giving him a formal name, simply calling him "Wugen" (Five Roots) in daily life. Among the children from the same batch, there was another who also had a Five-Element spiritual root of extremely poor aptitude, less than a month younger than Zhao Di. His nickname was an even less pleasant "Little Wugen."

After Zhao Di learned about his spiritual root attributes, he was depressed for a long time, but then he became even more determined to embark on the path of cultivation. He believed that diligence could compensate for deficiencies, and he refused to believe that with the mind of a twenty-something-year-old, he couldn't surpass the achievements of the children around him who were only a few years old. Another factor was that he always believed his rebirth as an infant was connected to that meteor-like ball of light. Whether it was a coincidence or not, he wanted to understand what had happened and find a way to return to the Great Tang Kingdom. If one day he could become a legendary cultivator, possessing great divine abilities to alter heaven and earth and cross spatial boundaries, perhaps he would find the answer.
