Chapter 289: Peculiar Signs, New Efficacy, Teaching Liu Qing, The Day of the Wager

Li Xian felt a vague sense of strangeness and immediately walked to the courtyard. He plucked another strand of hair and threw it onto the muddy ground. The hair touched the soil and instantly sprouted roots, burrowing deep into the earth. Li Xian focused his mind and felt a faint connection with the hair, as if his senses could be extended through it.

There were sensations like "hearing" and "touch." Even when he closed his eyes, he could vaguely perceive his surroundings, though they were shrouded in a black mist. If someone were to pass by, he couldn't make out their appearance, nor could he distinguish their height or build. Although it was extremely blurry, the sensation was real.

Li Xian was immensely curious. Such a special ability would be incredibly useful. If verified to be true, it would be another life-preserving skill. Determined to figure it out, he plucked another strand of hair, gently broke it, leaving only an inch long, and sent it into Nan Gong Liuli's room.

The hair took root upon hitting the ground, so fine it was almost unnoticeable. Faint sounds reached his ears: Nan Gong Liuli's footsteps, the rustle of her skirt against the floor.

Nan Gong Liuli was elegant and composed. At that moment, she was sitting in quiet meditation, practicing her inner cultivation. The two of them were partners in sincere cooperation, treating each other with honesty. Li Xian was purely testing the miraculous use of the "hair" and had no sinister intentions of spying.

He confirmed the "hair" possessed a miraculous effect, then pushed the door open and shattered the hair. Nan Gong Liuli frowned and opened her eyes, her face flushing with a hint of embarrassment. After a brief exchange, Li Xian left, leaving Nan Gong Liuli utterly confused. She could only softly curse under her breath before continuing her martial arts practice.

Li Xian pondered... He and Nan Gong Liuli often exchanged insights on the Dao of martial arts. "Three Flowers Converging at the Crown" and "Dust Settling" were both considered useless signs, but Li Xian had unique variations. "Three Flowers Converging at the Crown," boiling Qi and refining purity, allowed him to form a furnace in his belly, cleansing filth and avoiding toxins.

"Dust Settling," where hair falls and takes root, could extend his perception and allow him to eavesdrop. Though these miscellaneous benefits were small, their application could be extraordinary.

Li Xian discovered that the "falling hair taking root" effect could only coexist with three strands. If he exceeded this number, the previous strands would wither, maintaining the limit of three.

\[Bone-Shaping Demon Embryo\]
\[Proficiency: 2/100\]
\[Description: The second realm of martial arts, a transformation from the body to the bones. The body possesses ethereal fairy sounds, Three Flowers Converging at the Crown, a Filth-Robe, Dust Settling, and other such mystical phenomena.\]

\[Wraith-Spear\]
\[Proficiency: 4235/5000 (Minor Accomplishment)\]
\[Description: A flawed imitation of the Specter-Demon-Ghoul-Ghost spear. The ghostly intent is faint, but it is already quite formidable. Through diligent practice and understanding the true meaning from the fragmented diagram, you have reached Minor Accomplishment and grasped the "Ghostly Veil" spear stance.\]

When the Wraith-Spear was danced, it exuded a chilling ghostly aura, blinding the opponent's eyes, a truly demonic and formidable technique. The strange power of this spear art only began to reveal itself after reaching "Minor Accomplishment."

Li Xian's internal Qi had accumulated to a full eighty-zhang Qi Lake, vast yet restrained. When he channeled his Qi, his spear-dancing could startle gods and frighten ghosts.

If he were to reveal his pupils or don the God-Demon Robe... his might would be different once more. Li Xian practiced secretly, feeling immensely satisfied, silently accumulating his capital.

All things progressed in an orderly fashion.

By this day, the peach wood bow was finally complete.

Nan Gong Liuli was skilled at fletching arrows but did not know how to make a longbow. It required Li Xian to personally forge it: carving the bow's shape, boiling and soaking it in beast oil, polishing it with sandpaper, drying it, and stringing it with beast sinew...

Li Xian was very proficient. Nan Gong Liuli was even more curious and asked about Li Xian's origins. Upon learning he was from a hunter's family, she finally understood. She was very much looking forward to the archery competition.

After the final steps were completed, the peach wood bow was finished. It shimmered with a jade-like luster, polished to be sturdy and durable. Holding it in hand, it gave off a handsome and heroic air.

Li Xian's "Peach Wood Bow" was made from a peach tree spirit and golden leopard sinew. The bow's body was larger and thicker, with immense power. Nan Gong Liuli's bow was made from a peach tree spirit and black ox sinew, of slightly lower quality. Her bow required consideration for arm span, and its body was more slender and refined. Li Xian thoughtfully adorned it with peach blossoms, which greatly pleased her.

Both of them drew the empty string, feeling eager to try. They decided to fulfill their agreement and compete in archery.

Nan Gong Liuli laughed, "Good little brother, your big sister won't go easy on you."

They used weeds to make two straw men and placed them by the red wall of the outer courtyard. The two walked to the inner courtyard, a distance of several hundred paces from the straw men, with an arched gate in between.

Li Xian said with a smile, "You think you've already won me? So arrogant." Nan Gong Liuli replied, "You're from a hunter's family, your archery is indeed not bad, but you only shoot wild boars and birds. How could you beat me? Watch closely, don't cry if you lose."

She drew a wooden arrow from her quiver. It was a dark red color. Nan Gong Liuli nocked the arrow and aimed. Her beautiful eyes narrowed slightly, and her aura changed instantly. She looked heroic and valiant, her long skirt swaying without wind.

The arrow flew from the string, hitting the straw man with perfect accuracy. Nan Gong Liuli looked quite proud, glancing at Li Xian and saying, "Good little brother, it's your turn." She used to not call him "good little brother," but since they were alone and had done everything together, the affectionate nickname had stuck.

Li Xian said, "Excellent archery!" It was a sincere compliment. He nocked an arrow, didn't seem to aim, and simply released his fingers. The arrow flew out and hit the straw man's bullseye.

Nan Gong Liuli was slightly surprised but then understood. She had observed Li Xian's posture was not standard, and she figured that while his archery was good, he had no famous master to teach him, following a "wild path."

Li Xian said, "Oh, looks like we're tied." Nan Gong Liuli was also young and proud. Holding her bow, her spirit was high. A tie was not her intention. She said, "This courtyard is too small to decide a winner."

Seeing that Nan Gong Liuli was in high spirits, Li Xian said, "You want to go out and compete?"

Nan Gong Liuli sighed, "Alas, it seems this archery competition will have no result."

Li Xian said, "Not necessarily." He looked around. He knew the Flower Cage Gate was full of spies. If Nan Gong Liuli showed herself, she would attract attention. His own foundation was unstable, his experience shallow, and he had powerful enemies. He should remain low-key and hide his edge, accumulating his foundation.

It was safer for Nan Gong Liuli not to leave the courtyard. He pointed to a distant mountain and said, "How about this... Liuli-jie, from here, we can see that mountain peak. Tomorrow, I will climb to the peak, set up a target, and we can shoot at it. That will decide the winner."

Nan Gong Liuli shot him a glance, thinking: "Bad boy... He doesn't want to lose to me, so he's either setting the target too far or too close, always resulting in a tie. Hmph... The distance is far, but that doesn't mean I can't reach it. You've been acting cocky lately. If I don't show a little skill, won't I be shaming my family's name?"

She found it amusing and pretended to be reluctant but agreed. She planned to amaze Li Xian the next day, but considering their sincere cooperation, crushing his spirit might not be appropriate. She would need to comfort him with words. After defeating him, she would also need to show weakness to soothe his feelings.

The next day.

Li Xian practiced his "Wraith-Spear" in the morning, loosening his muscles and bones, and accumulating proficiency. When he had gained 36 proficiency points, the sun was bright and the weather was perfect.

Li Xian hurried to the distant mountain peak. He set up three targets on the mountainside, and then for every distance he climbed, he set up two more targets. In total, there were twenty targets.

He returned to the Green Ox Residence.

Nan Gong Liuli, holding her peach wood bow, was already brimming with heroic spirit. She gazed at the targets on the mountain, from near to far, all arranged perfectly. She estimated the farthest target was about several miles away, and the nearest was two miles.

Many targets were hidden in the grass or among the tree crowns. With slightly poorer eyesight, one might not even spot them. Li Xian asked, "Does your Nan Gong family hold winter hunts?"

Nan Gong Liuli nodded. "Naturally. The family's assessment of the younger generation is all-encompassing. The martial arts arena can show the strength of one's martial arts, but that is only the simplest test, revealing very little. The winter hunt is an extremely important event during the clan banquet, better at testing the younger generation's martial arts, adaptability, strategy... and so on."

"Each family has its own hunting mountain, rich in beasts. Every year, they purchase beasts to replenish the hunting grounds. There are also specialized clan members who investigate the distribution of beasts and the environment of the mountains."

Li Xian was very curious. The grandeur of a noble family was indeed extraordinary. Young members of the clan galloping across the hunting grounds, showcasing what they had learned—what a youthful scene. As a poor commoner, it was hard for him to witness such a grand event.

Li Xian asked, "That must be incredibly lively."

Nan Gong Liuli said nostalgically, "More than that. Every few years, several families join forces to arrive at the Xiongwen Mountain Range for a hunt. At that time... the Nan Gong, Bian, Fan, Zhao family of Daoxuan Mountain, the Baihe Academy... many young heroes will participate in the hunt. That is truly... a grand event."

"The families intermarry, which can also promote interaction between the younger generations. And heroes take the opportunity to stand out. That kind of spectacle is truly rare!"

Hearing the details of the noble families, Li Xian felt the gap between them but was not self-abased. Instead, he felt more motivated. They chatted for a while, and then the archery competition began.

Nan Gong Liuli raised her bow and aimed first. Her archery posture was extremely standard. Her breathing rhythm showed her extraordinary archery skills. Her arrow flew sharply, its arc perfect, hitting the target dead center.

Nan Gong Liuli glanced at him, a hint of provocation in her eyes. Li Xian smiled, nocked his bow, and shot. His archery was also extraordinary, hitting the target with unerring accuracy. Nan Gong Liuli said, "Good boy, you're quite skilled. I won't go easy on you now."

She nocked another arrow and shot at the farther targets one after another. Each arrow was incredibly precise and flawless, fully displaying her heroic posture. For every arrow she shot, Li Xian shot one in response, the time between their shots only a breath.

Nan Gong Liuli's brow gradually furrowed. She now felt that Li Xian's archery was unexpectedly good. Although these were "dead targets," hitting them so easily at this distance was no ordinary feat.

Nan Gong Liuli's temper flared; she was unwilling to lose. Her arrow momentum became even sharper, showing fierce accuracy. Each of them shot ten of the twenty targets. They had now reached the seventh one.

The distance suddenly increased. There were also scattered rocks blocking the way, making it extremely difficult to hit the target. Nan Gong Liuli frowned and shot at the eighth target, suddenly saying, "糟糕 (Zāogāo - Oh no)." The arrow suddenly veered off, missing the center by half an inch. Although it hit the target, it missed the bullseye.

Li Xian laughed, "Liuli-jie, you're going to lose." He raised his arrow and shot, hitting the bullseye without deviation.

The reason was...

Nan Gong Liuli's archery was excellent, and hitting a target at this distance should not have been difficult. However, the target was set too high, and the wind was strong at that height. Nan Gong Liuli overlooked this detail, causing her arrow to be blown off by a fraction.

This tiny margin was the key to victory. For the last two targets, she was on guard and hit them without incident. But Li Xian's archery exceeded her expectations, also hitting them with ease.

In this way... the tiny margin of error in Nan Gong Liuli's shot naturally became the reason for her defeat. In this archery duel, Li Xian was indeed the winner.

Nan Gong Liuli felt a bit displeased, thinking that since Li Xian had set up the targets, he must have anticipated this. He deliberately didn't remind her, secretly plotting to win this way. She knew Li Xian was clever and cautious, with many strange ideas, so this was not surprising.

But since she had failed, any further words would be an excuse. Nan Gong Liuli sighed, "I lost."

Li Xian could see that Nan Gong Liuli was not entirely convinced, but he didn't care much about this competition himself. He smiled, "Since you lost, what should you do, Liuli-jie?"

Nan Gong Liuli said, "Bad boy, we were just competing in archery to cultivate our minds. I didn't make a bet with you."

Li Xian laughed, "I don't care." He was being unreasonable. Nan Gong Liuli frowned, "You, this rascal, are so unreasonable."

Li Xian continued, "You are my beautiful companion. Do I need to be reasonable with you?"

Nan Gong Liuli stamped her foot, "You... you make me so mad." Her voice was crisp, without a trace of real anger.

She was both helpless and happy. Looking at his face, she was already unable to resist. Thinking that she could enjoy such happiness with him every day, even being trapped in the Flower Cage didn't seem so worrisome anymore.

But on the surface, she had to maintain her dignity. She needed Li Xian to be firm in his attitude and persuade her three times. After three times, she would reluctantly agree to anything.

Time passed.

The scorching heat of August steamed the world.

Li Xian practiced diligently every day. The Wraith-Spear gained hundreds of proficiency points daily. The wager was only for proficiency, which Li Xian had long since achieved. But martial arts were for his own cultivation, and the Flower Cage Gate was an evil sect. The Deputy Chief's temperament was eccentric, so he had to do his best.

He possessed "Heaven's Way Rewards Diligence." His accomplishments were all accumulated bit by bit. He was naturally not afraid of suspicion. Moreover, there were many geniuses in the world who achieve instant enlightenment and perfect their martial arts in an instant. His diligent practice was perfectly normal.

With this slow accumulation...

The weeds and rocks in the Wraith-Spear diagram had all been transformed into spear techniques. After Li Xian's long practice, he was extremely proficient.

"Swift Wind Tough Grass," "West Wind Brings Cold," "Old Tree and昏鸦 (Hūnyā - Dusky Crow)," "Weary Figure," "Parting Grass to Startle Ghost," "Fading Crow and Defeated Moon"...

Each move was evolved to perfection. Li Xian's understanding deepened. The unimportant scenery in the Wraith-Spear diagram gradually became infused with ghostly Qi...

He began to evolve his spear techniques from corpses. The diagram depicted seven残尸 (cánshī - mangled corpses). Three were detailed, hiding a strong spear intent. Four were hidden deep, only visible to a keen observer.

What kind of spear technique these corpses could evolve depended on one's comprehension. In this way, his spear art became profound. When he danced his spear, a ghostly mist was visible, chilling and sinister. Combined with "Writing Reflects the Person" and "Martial Arts Also Reflect the Person."

Li Xian was carefree and unrestrained, his life as fragile as a mayfly. When he施展 (shīzhǎn -施展) his spear technique, he was like a lonely soul or a wild ghost. He had also practiced orthodox martial arts like "Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword," "Gang Thunder Finger," and "Iron Copper Body." They were also elegant and ethereal, with proper form. With such a foundation, practicing the "Wraith-Spear" should have felt subtly incompatible.

But his uninhibited nature, combined with Heaven's Way Rewards Diligence, made it seem quite fitting. His evil Qi was rampant, possessing a wicked charm.

Nan Gong Liuli had once mistaken it for a ghost returning. After Li Xian explained it was a spear technique, her doubts were dispelled. She then learned that the spear art Li Xian practiced was related to "ghosts." Deeply afraid of ghosts, she never asked for details about the spear technique.

During this time...

Li Xian finally found the time to prepare a plan to make money. Shooting beasts to exchange for money. He had small money but not great wealth. The profitable businesses in Peach Blossom Town were almost all controlled by the elders. Ordinary people were engaged in basic livelihood trades related to food, clothing, housing, and transportation.

But it was enough for Li Xian and Nan Gong Liuli to have Peach Blossom Wine and Flower-Infused Drunken Eggs... The money they saved even helped Nan Gong Liuli prepare a new set of clothes. The silk fabric was quite bold. Nan Gong Liuli refused a few times but eventually wore them.

The day of the wager drew closer.

The situation in the Water Altar also changed subtly. Two elders of the Flower Cage Gate, riding flower boats, returned. Their names were An Weicheng and Han Zisha. An Weicheng was nearly seventy but had a youthful appearance and a slightly short stature. Han Zisha had a beautiful face, a charming woman with lingering elegance.

Each brought back dozens of Flower Cage Gate disciples. The island became lively. The two elders brought back a piece of news: Elder Tong Sannian had been不幸 (bùxìng - unfortunately) surrounded and killed by enemies.

Chief Shi heard the bad news and frowned. As the saying goes, one who enjoys the benefits must also bear the drawbacks. In recent years, the imperial court has declined, and local governance has been weak. The Flower Cage Gate took advantage of this, capturing the female members of noble families, making them the target of universal condemnation.

The Flower Cage Gate was very skilled in array techniques, creating arrays like "Blossoming Flowers Array," "Lost in Flowers Seeking Spring Array," and "Separating Flowers and Shifting Shadows Array," which could overcome the strong with the weak. As long as the disciples possessed internal Qi and strictly arranged the formation, they could defeat powerful martial artists and capture female heroes from the jianghu.

Over time... from the elders down to the disciples, they became dependent on arrays. Their martial arts inevitably became lazy, and their adaptability sluggish.

If their formation was broken or they were surrounded by more people, they would be helpless. In recent years, the number of elders who had lost their lives had already exceeded ten.

Chief Shi gathered the elders to discuss important matters. He announced the death of Tong Sannian and also decided on another pressing matter...

Tong Sannian's death—how should his property be handled? Tong Sannian possessed "two apiaries," "a grand mansion," "three beautiful wives," "an orchard," "a flower boat"...

The flower boat was lost during the ambush but must have been preserved intact. These many assets made the elders envious and eager to divide them all.

Han Zisha sobbed, "Zisha and Elder Tong were very close. My heart was already secretly given to him. Now that he has died outside, the mansion, apiaries, orchard... Zisha is willing to help manage them."

Her red lips were enchanting, she wore a light purple dress, her shoulders were bare, and her legs were wrapped in hazy silk stockings. When she spoke, she was pitifully moving.

An Weicheng said, "Han妹子 (mèizi - little sister), you can't say that. Elder Tong and I were close friends. The apiaries, beautiful wives, and flower boat should be managed by me."

Ye Cheng smiled, "I'll take one of the apiaries. As for the beautiful wives... I heard one of Elder Tong's wives is from the Sword Lake Manor. I'd like to have her."

Meng Han said, "I can concede on other things, but the flower boat should be mine this time."

Ye Cheng said, "It's not peaceful outside right now. If you take the flower boat, are you going out to die?"

The reason was... An Weicheng and Han Zisha had rushed back to the Water Altar with the intention of dividing the property. Everyone looked at Chief Shi, waiting for his decision.

Shi Yufei tapped the table with his fingers. The distribution of the assets should indeed be decided as soon as possible. If other elders found out, they would also rush back to the Water Altar, making the situation even more chaotic. But the distribution needed to be considered carefully.

He said, "Elder Tong was loyal to the Flower Cage Gate and died outside the Altar. I am deeply grieved. The distribution of his assets is a major matter. As you are not his relatives, you originally have no right to inherit. But as fellow elders, you are as close as family, which is different."

"From today on... Ye Cheng, you will investigate the cause of Elder Tong's death. Once it is confirmed that he was killed in an ambush, all his assets will be confiscated into the Water Altar. If you are willing, you can also use merit silver to purchase them."

All the elders said, "Yes!" They were all excited.

Ye Cheng immediately went out to investigate the exact cause of Tong Sannian's death. This was not difficult to find out. He returned quickly, confirming that Tong Sannian had been killed in an ambush, and immediately sent a letter to report.

After Shi Yufei learned of this, he incorporated the assets into the Water Altar. Although he said it was for public use, it was actually for distribution. "Incorporating into the Water Altar" was to堵住 (dǔ zhù - block the mouths of) the other elders who were not at the Altar, to avoid disputes over property. First, confiscate for public use, then have the elders purchase it with merit silver, which could avoid many troubles.

From distribution to purchase, it naturally became "first come, first served."

Shi Yufei assigned Tong Sannian's three beautiful wives to An Weicheng, Ye Cheng, and Meng Han. The flower boat was assigned to Meng Han, the mansion to Han Zisha. The apiaries and orchard were the top priorities. How the four elders would divide them was a great difficulty.

If this caused friction, it would be very inappropriate. No matter how Shi Yufei thought about it, he had no solution, so he had to temporarily put this matter aside.

In the blink of an eye, it was mid-August.

\[Bone-Shaping Demon Embryo\]
\[Proficiency: 2/100\]

The heavenly and earthly essences from drinking the Yellow Nine Ginseng had all been digested. Li Xian had no more "earthly essences" to digest. Without another \[Precious Essence\], his cultivation would stagnate.

He was calm and composed, calculating the days. Today was the day to fulfill the wager. He thought to himself: "I am a person of little renown and low status. The wager I set, Deputy Chief Yan might not even care about, or may have already forgotten. But it's fine... I want to acquire a skill from someone else's hands, which is an extremely difficult thing to begin with."

Nan Gong Liuli was practicing her sword nearby.

Li Xian's interest suddenly arose. He took up his peach wood spear and sparred with Nan Gong Liuli in the courtyard. He shouted, "Watch out for my spear!" Nan Gong Liuli replied, "Nice spear!" She turned her sword to parry. Both of them used basic moves. Li Xian swept, thrust, parried, and hacked. Nan Gong Liuli poked, parried, blocked, and dodged, exchanging dozens of moves. Their movements were graceful, as if they were dancing.

Nan Gong Liuli said, "Why did you stop?"

Li Xian retracted his spear and steadied himself. "I have something important to do. I'm going out. I don't know how long I'll be. Be careful on your own." Nan Gong Liuli nodded in agreement, helping Li Xian straighten his clothes, and repeatedly told him to be careful.

\[Wraith-Spear\]
\[Proficiency: 4235/5000 (Minor Accomplishment)\]

Li Xian's Wraith-Spear technique had made great progress. He chatted a bit more with Nan Gong Liuli and then left. Locking the door, he headed straight for the inner island.

He knew there were many disciples on the island recently, and he saw many fellow disciples along the way. When Li Xian passed by them, they all turned to look and discuss. Those who knew of Li Xian's name and deeds praised him highly, while those who didn't were amazed by his handsome appearance.

He rowed a boat across the lake and soon arrived at the Inquiry Martial Pavilion. Li Xian thought: "If I barge in like this, and Deputy Chief Yan dislikes it, he might refuse to see me. Then my wager would be for nothing." He didn't rush to enter, but hesitated outside for a moment.

He pretended to be hesitant, then entered the pavilion. After walking for a while, he met a servant guarding the pavilion. Li Xian asked, "Brother, do you know where Deputy Chief Yan is? I have something to find him for."

The servant said, "I'm sorry, I don't know Deputy Chief Yan's whereabouts either."

Li Xian was helpless and searched around. He already knew that Yan Hao had not taken his wager to heart, and may have even forgotten about it. He was certain that Li Xian's Wraith-Spear had no real skill, so why waste time with him? He decided that searching inside the pavilion would be futile.

He exited the Inquiry Martial Pavilion and waited by the door. "If Deputy Chief Yan goes out on business, I might be able to see him, or there might still be a chance."

He waited for half an hour when he suddenly heard footsteps. Yan Hao did indeed walk out of the pavilion. Li Xian said respectfully, "Deputy Chief Yan!"

Yan Hao was surprised and said, "Hua Wucuo? You..." He glanced at the long spear on Li Xian's back and remembered the wager. He couldn't help but frown: "This kid really knows how to take advantage of the situation. I see no sinister aura on him, so in this past month, he must have failed to grasp the essence of the Wraith-Spear. Why waste time with him?"

He immediately turned to leave.

Li Xian quickly chased after him, saying, "Deputy Chief Yan..."

Yan Hao suddenly thought: "I'm going to see Chief Shi. I heard Liu Qing is also there. I can't waste time with him, but if he follows me, I won't stop him. If he wants to make a fool of himself, let him." He quickened his pace.

Li Xian frowned. Seeing that Yan Hao's speed was fast but not urgent, he thought: "He seems to be leaving room for me to follow? Even if I fulfill the wager, if he doesn't want to teach me, he won't. He doesn't owe me anything, that's only natural. But... why think too much? Just do my best."

He then used the Seven Star Step and quickly followed.

They gradually arrived at a place filled with immortal mist.
