# Chapter 70: The Promise with the Ice Cube, Meeting in the Finals

“Master, you’ve been looking exhausted lately. You’re never home.”

“I wonder what you’re so busy with.”

Shang Wu muttered as she watched the figure bustling about in the kitchen.

The Master was completely in the dark regarding Li Mo’s progress.

“He should be practicing his sword.”

Ying Bing retracted her gaze.

Over the past few days, she had become increasingly certain that Li Mo’s previous questions weren’t just a coincidence. Every day, Li Mo would ask new questions about the Dao of the Sword, many of which were extensions and deep dives into yesterday’s inquiries.

What does this mean?

It means he hasn’t been slacking off. After their discussions, he engages in rigorous practice and research.

That’s why he leaves early and returns late every day.

“He’s working that hard?” Shang Wu blinked, looking a bit dazed.

“He is very hardworking,” Ying Bing said.

A hint of admiration flashed through the beautiful eyes reflected in the tea cup.

If one were to ask her what she relied on to ascend to the Nine Heavens in her previous life, it wasn't her heaven-defying physique or unparalleled talent. No, for those truly qualified to stand at the peak of the Martial Dao, those are merely icing on the cake.

It is persistence.

This is the most precious treasure that is easiest to obtain, yet also easiest to lose, for anyone swimming against the current in the long river of the Martial Dao.

“Eh? So he’s made great progress lately?”

Shang Wu’s face flushed slightly, her almond eyes shining with light. “Then this time, for the Nine Peaks Martial Assembly, my Qunyu Peak is finally going to make people sit up and take notice!”

Actually, saying “make people sit up and take notice” isn’t quite accurate. Qunyu Peak hadn’t even participated in many years...

Shang Wu had been eyeing the rewards of the Nine Peaks Martial Assembly for a long time. Based on the disciples’ rankings in the assembly, the sect would grant generous resource rewards, including but not limited to martial arts, pills, and rare treasures...

“I wonder what kind of reward the champion of this assembly will get.”

Shang Wu’s thoughts were running wild.

The champion of the assembly is the current Chief Disciple of Qingyuan Sect. The reward would be even more exaggerated.

“Rewards...”

Ying Bing poured another cup of tea, her thoughts drifting far away.

She couldn’t remember the other rewards too clearly, but there was one item that was available to the top three of every assembly: the qualification to choose a supreme technique.

Thinking of this, Ying Bing gently stroked Frost Sword.

The first owner of Frost Sword had a sword technique that was classified as a supreme technique, and so did the Crimson Sky Sword. The two supreme sword techniques complemented each other and could resonate and verify each other.

To be precise, this was actually one single sword technique.

《Sun and Moon Interchange Sword Art》, originating from the Tianshan Sword Manor.

This was originally a martial art that allowed two people to exchange their spirits through their swords and progress together.

Many people in Qingyuan Sect over the generations had tried to recreate the power of the two swords joining as one, but they all failed. The root cause was that they were all focusing on the superficial and losing the essence.

“Dinner is almost ready, come give me a hand!”

At this moment, Chef Li’s voice came from the kitchen.

Ying Bing put down Frost Sword and walked into the kitchen.

Tonight they were having hotpot. The broth was already prepared. Li Mo was standing with his back to the door, cutting side dishes.

“Li Mo.”

“Hmm? Oh right, have you been avoiding spicy food lately?”

Li Mo was quite focused and didn’t even turn his head.

“I haven’t. What’s your current cultivation level?” Ying Bing asked.

Li Mo was silent for a moment before tentatively replying:

“Late-stage Blood Qi Realm, Great Perfection?”

Ying Bing: “?”

Why not just say Blood Qi Realm Great Perfection? Where did all those suffixes come from?

Actually, Little Li had his own troubles. A normal Blood Qi Realm Great Perfection has twelve meridians, but he has already opened thirty-five main meridians.

Obviously, this cannot be equated with a normal Blood Qi Realm Great Perfection.

“Then I won’t add any chili. We’ll have a clear broth hotpot tonight.”

Li Mo was also a bit curious and asked, “What about your progress?”

“I will reach Inner Breath Realm tonight.”

“Let’s add a bit of chili then. It’s not hotpot without chili.”

Ying Bing’s tone was light, as if it were a foregone conclusion, with no consideration for the possibility of failing to break through.

***

Little Li wasn’t surprised by this answer. It was just the Ice Cube’s normal performance.

“So you won’t be staying in the Inner Breath Realm for long. How’s the preparation for the Nine Peaks Martial Assembly going? I’m adding more garlic, I love garlic.”

“The Nine Peaks Martial Assembly, I will take the championship.”

“You can make yourself a garlic dipping sauce.”

There was something slightly strange about the scene. Amidst shocking information, there were topics about whether to add chili or garlic to the hotpot. The two people involved didn’t find it strange at all.

“You’ve made great progress lately too,” Ying Bing said softly, wrapping the minced garlic into a small bowl with her light.

“Nothing compared to yours,” Li Mo replied, adhering to the traditional virtue of humility as a descendant of the Yellow Emperor.

“No need for modesty. I can sense your progress,” Ying Bing said. The image of Li Mo’s busy back was reflected in her eyes. “Among your peers, besides me, your sword Dao attainment is unparalleled. You have a chance to compete for a ranking.”

Li Mo’s movements paused for a moment, then he smiled nonchalantly.

“What’s the point of competing for rankings?”

“You wouldn’t be wanting to meet me in the finals, would you?”

Little Li really had no interest in competing for rankings. He didn’t lack the sect’s rewards.

“I hope you can make it into the top three,” Ying Bing said suddenly, her voice like jade falling onto the ground.

*Clang—*

Li Mo was stunned for a moment and turned around.

The girl stood at the doorway holding the hotpot. Moonlight shone from behind her, casting a halo on her icy skin and jade-like bones. The night breeze brushed past, causing the clothes sewn by her mother to ripple...

“Alright, we’ll meet in the finals,” Li Mo nodded.

“Mm,” Ying Bing lowered her eyes and nodded.

Listening to the sound of her footsteps fading away, Little Li finally turned back, looking at the chipped kitchen knife in his hand and muttering:

“Wouldn’t it have ruined the mood if I had asked why just now?”

Well, even though he didn’t know why the Ice Cube had expectations for him, since he had promised, he would do it.

His sword Dao attainment really wasn’t as high as the Ice Cube thought, but if it really came down to it...

He would just pull out the hammer.

***

The pleasant dinner time at Qiushui Pavilion ended, and they each returned to their rooms.

Li Mo then slipped out into the darkness.

He was already quite tired today, but he planned to train some more. After all, he was getting closer to the Inner Breath Realm, and he was a bit excited to know what that realm was like.

The night grew deeper.

*Bubbling bubbling—*

The water in the stone pool suddenly began to boil. The medicinal power of the Ten Thousand Year Earth Vein Spirit Milk, like starlight, flowed into his body with the rhythm of his breath.

In his Dantian.

Nourished by the abundant Earth Vein Essence, the final lotus seed was finally planted. The thirty-six lotus seeds in his body were all perfectly round and emitted a spiritual light, surging with dragon-like blood Qi.

Li Mo did not stop.

Using the residual Earth Vein Essence, he began to attempt to break through to the Inner Breath Realm.

According to the description of the Fire Heart Lotus Method, once the lotus seeds break open, sprout, and swallow blood Qi to transform it into Inner Breath, it is considered a success.

However, Li Mo, who had never encountered a bottleneck before, frowned this time.

“I can’t convert my blood Qi into Inner Breath?”

“The Ten Thousand Year Earth Vein Essence is useless? No... it doesn’t seem to be the case...”

He opened his eyes, and a burning starlight flashed past in his pupils. He pondered while sensing.

The effect of the Earth Vein Essence was still strong, so that wasn’t the problem.

The problem lay with him.

He couldn’t condense his blood Qi into Inner Breath.

The blood Qi in his thirty-six main meridians was too immense.

The creator of the Fire Heart Lotus Method probably never imagined that a monster who could condense thirty-six lotus seeds would appear, so he never considered this situation.

“The superior mental cultivation technique isn’t enough.”

“I still have one Ancient Bronze Heavenly Book Seal,” Li Mo thought for a moment and took out an Ancient Bronze Heavenly Book Seal that he had obtained from Princess Jiang.
