# Chapter 477: Sometimes You Have to Pretend

He hesitated for a moment before respectfully raising several key issues he had encountered during his comprehension of the "Grafting of Cavern Heavens" technique. These specifically involved the "Root Lock" for precisely anchoring the core of a minor thousand-world, the "Buffer Method for reconciling one's own Dao Foundation with the Heaven-Root Qi of the world during grafting," and the most critical issue: "How to stabilize the embryonic form of the Cavern Heaven after a successful graft to avoid backlash."

He posed these questions with a cautious and studious attitude, each one hitting the critical and dangerous points of the grafting technique, yet making it seem like the natural confusion of a novice.

This was enough to show that he had been seriously studying this true cultivation method, appearing as someone who, despite having slightly mediocre aptitude, was extremely diligent.

With the Attribute Panel as his guide, he naturally understood how to begin cultivating the Grafting of Cavern Heavens, and the solutions to some of its difficult and crucial points were clear to him.

However, sometimes, one has to pretend to get by better.

The Hundred Peaks True Lord nodded frequently as he listened, understanding that Xu Yunfan had indeed studied it seriously, but his comprehension seemed a bit lacking.

He pondered this internally and patiently answered each question one by one.

He elaborated on the core essentials of the grafting technique and the methods for avoiding risks, his words filled with the harmony of fellow sect brothers.

If this scene were in another sect, passing cultivators would surely praise it as a Daoist sect full of love and harmony, with a pure and upright family style.

But if it were within the Primordial Origin Sect, it looked bizarre no matter how you viewed it.

If it were a master and disciple, it would be one thing, but for fellow disciples to act like this, there was definitely something worth discussing.

After finishing his explanation, he looked at Xu Yunfan's contemplative expression and stroked his beard with a smile. "Junior Brother, the fact that you could ask these questions proves you have put in the effort. Although your comprehension... compared to those brilliant and outstanding talents, can only be considered average, what is valuable is your diligence and steadfastness, and your resilient temperament, which is especially rare. Given your current progress, with some time spent in arduous cultivation and contemplation, it should not be a problem to initially master this technique. If you have any不解, feel free to send me a message at any time."

This evaluation of being "average in aptitude but diligent" made Xu Yunfan feel secretly relieved. He merely put on a somewhat "speechless" expression and cupped his hands again. "Thank you for your explanation, Senior Brother! Junior Brother... will surely double his efforts and not live up to the True Lord's high expectations!"

The Hundred Peaks True Lord offered a few words of encouragement, asked about the recent situation in the Cold Goose Pass, and then floated away.

The imposing spiritual pressure, as heavy as a mountain, disappeared, and the Cold Goose Pass returned to normal.

Some rogue cultivators in the market relaxed their expressions, assuming it was just a Foundation Establishment True Lord from the Primordial Origin Sect on patrol. After all, during the tribute ceremonies, Foundation Establishment True Lords had come before.

"Great True Lord, Hundred Peaks Peak's Chu Chengnan..."

In the outermost market of the Cold Goose Pass, in an inconspicuous street corner, a middle-aged man in coarse linen clothes was sitting cross-legged on a bluestone slab.

Before him lay a yellowed oilcloth, on which were scattered a few rusted ancient coins, several dull-colored jade stones, and a few old books with curled corners.

These items looked particularly shabby amidst the bustling market, and passersby were too stingy to even cast a glance at them. Occasionally, a gaze would fall upon them, but it would only be tinged with a hint of disdain.

This guy was definitely trying to scam people. This style of setting up a stall had long been played out by those Primordial Origin Sect disciples.

When the Hundred Peaks True Lord's figure vanished into the distant sky, the man slowly raised his lowered eyebrows.

His weather-beaten face showed no trace of abnormality, not even the tiniest muscle twitching, maintaining the unique numbness and weariness of a street vendor.

Only the eyes hidden deep within his wrinkles revealed a hint of unusual clarity in the instant he looked up, like moonlight suddenly passing under a murky pond.

If a cultivator skilled in mind-reading or similar divine sense secret techniques were here, they would surely be startled by the abnormality in these eyes.

Deep within the seemingly murky pupils lay a bottomless well of compassion. This compassion was not a superficial pity, but a serenity akin to the rhythm of the Dao, precipitated after experiencing countless calamities.

What was even more bizarre was that this transcendent and detached aura was perfectly sealed beneath an atmosphere of the mortal world, so much so that even a Foundation Establishment True Lord's divine sense sweep failed to detect it in the slightest.

The man's rough fingers unconsciously stroked a copper coin, his fingertip feeling the indistinct characters for "Taiping Tongbao" on its surface. This was a currency issued by a Dao Court a hundred thousand years ago, which vanished overnight a hundred thousand years ago. Now, these coins had become rare treasures.

He looked in the direction where the Hundred Peaks True Lord had departed, and the corner of his mouth suddenly浮现 a faint smile. This smile contained neither mockery nor calculation; it was more like the understanding and sigh an old farmer would show when watching ants move their homes before a heavy rain.

After seeing off the Hundred Peaks True Lord, Xu Yunfan returned to his meditation room and sat down cross-legged.

The last trace of respectful笑意 on his face completely vanished, leaving only a hint of disdain.

'Average aptitude?'

He silently repeated these four words in his heart, the corner of his mouth curling into a sneer. If it had been before, it would have been fine to say his aptitude was average. But now, with his clone as a guarantee, his clone's talent was brilliant and outstanding, and his comprehension was even more superhuman. What belonged to the clone was his.

From the Hundred Peaks True Lord's words and explanations, he could clearly feel the will of the true master behind him, the Clear Source True Lord. The other party was urging him on!

Urging him to quickly bind himself to the Divine Martial World according to that set of grafting techniques which concealed lethal methods.

He could almost imagine the outcome: the moment the embryonic form of the Cavern Heaven condensed would be the moment his soul and Dao Foundation fell completely into the Clear Source True Lord's grasp, becoming high-quality fertilizer for the other party to cultivate the Divine Martial World into that "Dao Fruit Divine Tree."

'Golden Core True Lord... a single thought can perceive the birth and destruction of all things... Within the Divine Martial World, I still have the Heavenly Dao barrier for cover. But once I start using the grafting technique to anchor the root, I will have actively removed all concealment! Time... is running out!'

This thought, like a thunderclap, dispelled all hesitation. Xu Yunfan took a deep breath, suppressing his turbulent emotions, and his eyes became as flat and calm as an ancient, undisturbed well.

In the days that followed, Xu Yunfan's focus in cultivation shifted. Besides maintaining the operation of the "True武 Subduing Demons Scripture" to consolidate his Dao Foundation, he devoted the vast majority of his energy to comprehending and practicing the "Grafting of Cavern Heavens," and to frantically increasing the proficiency of the "Xuandu Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Scripture."

If it weren't for the Attribute Panel, the Xuandu Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Scripture would absolutely be a colossal pit. At this point, he also understood why Li Baichuan, despite having such a supreme method, had no intention of cultivating it at all.

However, the one who released this method, who calculated everything, absolutely could not have calculated that he would have an Attribute Panel, which could forcefully control the Scripture's化身, filling that enormous pit.

The contents of the "Grafting of Cavern Heavens" flowed through his mind. The core of this grafting divine ability lies in constructing a "Spiritual Ruin Bridge" composed of complex talismans and Dao rules. One end of this bridge needs to be anchored to the cultivator's own Dao Foundation core, while the other end needs to penetrate the origin of a minor thousand-world, forcibly extracting its origin "Root Qi" like a tree root absorbing nutrients.

The cultivation process is extremely perilous. One must combine one's own divine sense with a specific incantation seal to condense a "chain" capable of deceiving the will of the world.
