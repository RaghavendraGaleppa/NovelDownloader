# Chapter 37: The Orphaned Girl  

Under normal circumstances, Qin Chong would have left this place immediately.  

But now, his own condition was severely depleted, forcing him to take the risk of staying to recover.  

By the afternoon of the next day, Qin Chong had only regained about twenty to thirty percent of his mana. Still, he quickly left his hiding spot, deciding it was best to recover elsewhere.  

This time, his impulsive intervention had been reckless—he had nearly lost his life.  

Yet Qin Chong didn’t regret it, though a lingering fear remained. If not for the Devouring Spirit Flying Ants, he would have perished.  

Even he found it hard to believe that, in that moment, he had completely disregarded his own life.  

Sacrificing himself for righteousness? Dying for a noble cause?  

It made him think of his past life.  

People often said, *"Better a dog in times of peace than a man in times of chaos."*  

In this world of cultivation, even if the mortal realm wasn’t embroiled in large-scale wars, countless dangers still lurked for ordinary people—whether from ruthless demonic cultivators or savage demonic beasts. Once encountered, the outcome was predictable.  

That day, the demonic cultivator had called them *"ants."* Though the words stung, they were the truth. In this world, mortals were indeed the lowest of the low.  

Perhaps the people here had long grown accustomed to such realities, but Qin Chong still struggled to accept it. Even after living here for years, some of his fundamental beliefs weren’t so easily changed.  

It was a pity he hadn’t been able to save the villagers, but he had done his best. That, at least, gave him some solace.  

After leaving his hiding place, Qin Chong didn’t depart immediately. Instead, he returned to the massacred village and buried all the remains before preparing to leave.  

But then, the sound of a child’s cry startled him.  

Someone had survived!  

Yet when he expanded his divine sense, it covered the entire village without detecting any signs of life.  

This puzzled him.  

With no other choice, he followed the sound.  

At the edge of the village, he found a partially intact house where the crying came from.  

Inside, in a corner, lay an overturned three-legged bronze cauldron, rusted but still structurally intact.  

When he lifted it, he found a two- or three-year-old girl inside, crying.  

Qin Chong hurriedly picked her up. Surprisingly, the girl wasn’t afraid of him—instead, she giggled happily.  

*Sigh.*  

Qin Chong sighed. He couldn’t just leave a survivor, especially a child, to die.  

Turning his attention to the cauldron, he examined it carefully but found nothing unusual. Yet, since it had shielded the girl from his divine sense and saved her life, it was clearly no ordinary object.  

With a wave of his hand, he stored it in his storage pouch for later study.  

The girl giggled again, amused by the "magic trick" of the disappearing cauldron.  

This journey was already uncertain, and now he had a little burden to carry.  

After some thought, Qin Chong made a decision.  

Carrying the girl made flying by sword inconvenient, so he traveled on foot. Even so, his speed far surpassed that of an ordinary person.  

Days later, he arrived at a small city called Wutong, named for the many phoenix trees surrounding it.  

The city was small, with only about a hundred thousand inhabitants, the southernmost settlement in Pingchuan Prefecture. Just a hundred miles north lay the border of the Han Kingdom.  

After staying in the city for a few days, Qin Chong entrusted the girl to an elderly couple with the surname Liu before leaving.  

He had chosen them carefully—they were well-off but childless, making them ideal caretakers.  

Still, he gave them some gold and silver, hoping they would raise the girl well.  

With the matter settled, Qin Chong felt much lighter. As he left Wutong City, his mood was unusually bright—though the memory of the slaughtered villagers would likely stay with him forever.  

As an outsider to this world, such scenes left a deep impression.  

But Qin Chong understood: this was a world of cultivation, a brutal place where the strong preyed on the weak. He might witness such horrors again, but he hoped he wouldn’t.  

Moreover, the sudden appearance of a demonic cultivator in the Song Kingdom weighed heavily on his mind.  

That evening, Qin Chong finally reached the border between the two prefectures. As night fell, he concealed himself as usual.  

Now, he began inspecting the demonic cultivator’s storage pouch.  

There were over a thousand spirit stones—a considerable sum for a Qi Refinement cultivator.  

What interested him most was the black flying sword. Though tainted by the demonic cultivator’s energy, it could still be refined into a fine high-grade magical artifact.  

The sword was named *Moxuan*, heavier than ordinary flying swords.  

There was also the high-grade defensive artifact, the *Green Scale Shield*, which had easily withstood the full force of his *Four Symbols Rotating Spear*. Its quality was excellent, making it a valuable treasure.  

Several bottles of demonic cultivation pills were also inside. These would be hard to sell in the Song Kingdom, rendering them nearly useless—but he kept them anyway.  

Miscellaneous spirit herbs and materials were carelessly transferred to his own storage pouch without much scrutiny.  

The demonic artifact *Soul-Snatching Banner* had been destroyed in battle, and Qin Chong had deliberately left its remnants behind. If anyone discovered the scene, they would know the massacre was the work of a demonic cultivator.  

As for the dozen or so jade slips, Qin Chong skimmed through them.  

He ignored the cultivation techniques but found several secret arts intriguing:  

- **Soul-Searching Art** – Allowed one to extract memories from an enemy’s soul.  
- **Blood Sacrifice Art** – Not a ritual sacrifice, but a technique to temporarily enhance an artifact’s power by burning one’s own blood essence in battle.  
- **Phantom Shadow Escape** – Likely the technique the demonic cultivator had used to escape the explosion of the *Silver Frost Sword*.  

These arts weren’t difficult to learn, but mastering them required practice and depended on one’s cultivation level.  

The *Phantom Shadow Escape*, in particular, consumed vast amounts of mana and blood essence, making it a last-resort technique for life-or-death situations.
