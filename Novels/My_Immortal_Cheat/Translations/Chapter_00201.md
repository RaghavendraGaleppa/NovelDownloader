# Chapter 201: The Human Skin from Bianyu

Although he couldn't use this item right now, he was happy just having it in his pocket. Moreover, even if he couldn't use it, the Zhou family surely could. He believed that even if he handed it over to the Zhou family, they would definitely not treat it poorly. Now that he could cultivate, many things became usable for him.

"In that case, let's wait for your two friends to arrive, benefactor." Puzhi's gaze was profound as he stared at the human skin book suspended above.

"Alright," Zhou Tian nodded.

They didn't wait long. Both were at the Dao Lord realm. Although they couldn't teleport or fly like Zhou Tian and had to travel on foot, they encountered many obstacles, which significantly slowed them down. However, they were still exceptional individuals, and quickly discovered the conflict between the human skins and skeletons, allowing them to pick up their pace.

Bored, Zhou Tian squatted by the stone monument railings, staring blankly at the mysterious patterns. For some reason, the human skin book was in the central plaza before him, but it didn't launch any attacks against him, as if something was suppressing it.

Suddenly, he felt a distinctive aura approaching. Turning his head, he saw a majestic figure emerge from the residential area, body radiant. It was indeed the Holy Demon. He immediately stood up and called out, "Brother, you're here!"

The Holy Demon nodded, then turned to Puzhi, inclining his head slightly as a greeting. "Daoist friend must be Grandmaster Puzhi," he said.

"I passed away countless years ago; I can no longer bear the title of Grandmaster," Puzhi shook his head, his gaze fixed on the Holy Demon. He seemed a little taken aback, then sighed and said, "Two similar flowers are, in the end, merely similar."

"Daoist friend, you are too attached to appearances. In this world, how can there be reincarnation?" the Holy Demon's eyes shone brightly as he spoke with conviction.

"Perhaps," Puzhi replied ambiguously.

"Enough with this useless talk, brother! This time, it's a big deal..." Zhou Tian interrupted them, relaying the news he had just received to the Holy Demon. Then, under the Holy Demon's strangely bewildered gaze, he awkwardly scratched his head, feeling a little shy.

"You really don't know how to spell 'death,' do you? You dare to take on a task involving three Heavenly Venerates," the Holy Demon truly didn't know what to say. He had just merged two personalities, free of worries, and a bright future awaited him outside. Now, he was going to face three Heavenly Venerates? He felt truly bitter. "Are you really confident you can handle one Heavenly Venerate?" the Holy Demon asked uneasily.

"Barely," Zhou Tian smiled shyly.

"..." The Holy Demon hadn't expected Zhou Tian's divine abilities to be so heaven-defying. He grew even more curious about what kind of fortuitous encounter Zhou Tian had obtained.

"Holy Demon benefactor, I must inform you in advance: we might need to borrow your lotus seed then. As it was nurtured by a projection of my master's fundamental treasure, it contains some of his aura, which I might need for some of my techniques," Puzhi told the Holy Demon, giving him a heads-up to avoid misunderstandings later.

"What do I get in return?" the Holy Demon asked unceremoniously, even though the lotus seed itself was obtained here.

Zhou Tian gave the Holy Demon a speechless glance, wishing he would at least be a little more subtle.

"A portion of my master's legacy." Puzhi, however, showed little reaction, perhaps thinking that these things were just sitting there anyway.

"Alright," the Holy Demon nodded. Although he had now integrated his personalities, Wutian's legacy still held great appeal for him; after all, Wutian was a Heavenly Venerate, and among the very top tier.

The three of them waited for a while longer, until Huang Qi arrived. Although he appeared shocked at the prospect of facing three Heavenly Venerates, he showed no intention of retreating. He had come specifically for the human skin book, and no matter what, he would not back down.

"Since you're from Bianyu, you naturally know the power of this human skin book, right? We will hold off those three remnants for you, but the task of collecting the human skin book falls to you. If you make even the slightest suspicious move, I will directly act against you!" Puzhi was far less polite with Huang Qi. Wutian's death in meditation was originally due to a great battle with Bianyu, and although Puzhi now needed to borrow Huang Qi's strength, he wouldn't show him any good favor.

"Naturally, my Bianyu only seeks the human skin book. As long as we obtain it, nothing will go wrong," Huang Qi said calmly, unmoved by Puzhi's words.

"Very well, since you're here, let's begin," Puzhi said. The most crucial person for collecting the human skin book had arrived, so it was naturally time to start quickly, rather than waiting for the three remnants to arrive.

"Alright," Huang Qi nodded without hesitation. With a flick of his hand, a blood-colored box appeared, covered in mysterious patterns and occasionally emitting a faint crimson glow. He slowly opened the box, and a streak of blood-red light shot out, hovering in the sky. Zhou Tian's eyes widened sharply; he almost made a move, because it was a human skin, smooth and supple, flowing with a mysterious luster.

The moment this human skin appeared, the human skin book in the central plaza suddenly began to tremble, and waves surged on the crimson river. On the black stone monuments in the plaza, patterns lit up, and massive monument shadows emerged, flickering with dark light. Patterns also lit up on the ground; this was a grand formation, connected to the entire ancient city, suppressing the human skin book.

"Huang Qi, are you sending helpers to the enemy?" Zhou Tian couldn't help but ask, because the human skin was clearly flying towards the human skin book, as if being summoned.

Huang Qi glanced at Zhou Tian but said nothing. Instead, he took out another blood-colored gourd, only palm-sized, as smooth and translucent as jade. He easily pulled out the stopper, and a pillar of blood shot up into the sky, containing scattered flecks of gold. It had a fragrant scent, imbued with divine substances, completely different from the crimson river. The blood pillar surging from the gourd entered the human skin, which then swelled up as if inflated, its body becoming full and a young face appearing. Although the gourd was only palm-sized, the blood pouring out seemed endless.

Simultaneously, Huang Qi produced a golden talisman, on which a few strokes depicted incredibly profound patterns, like Daoist script. The golden talisman flew out and affixed itself to the human skin's forehead. With a flash of golden light, the talisman vanished, but the human skin trembled slightly. A pair of eyes slowly emerged within its blood-red pupils, its black hair became radiant, and an ancient aura emanated from it. The once blood-filled human skin had become indistinguishable from a real person.

"Book of Sacrifice... I finally see you again," the human skin spoke, its voice ancient and distant, as if not emanating from the skin itself, but from the depths of time.

"Book of Sacrifice?" Zhou Tian was slightly startled. The consciousness within this human skin was clearly not simple; it knew the true name of the human skin book.
