# Chapter 470: Bittering the Clone

Xu Yunfan furrowed his brow slightly. Given the Origin Sect's nature, such a top-tier artifact refining method must have a deeper meaning behind it.

It was likely another bait set by some old monster.

However, now that it had fallen into his hands, Xu Yunfan wouldn't show any courtesy. Who knows, later on, he might even get to see the two True Lords fighting each other.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but pinch the bridge of his nose.

After coming back to his senses, the series of events made him feel as if he had developed paranoia.

It seemed...

Xu Yunfan's gaze shifted, his eyes inadvertently sweeping over the attribute panel floating in the depths of his consciousness.

He was almost certain that it was the system panel constantly flashing information prompts that allowed him to capture those emerging hints in real time, thereby敏锐ly detecting anomalies and reacting in time.

"Better to have it, better to have it..." Xu Yunfan muttered to himself. In the Taihua Void Realm, there were no good people.

These two True Scriptures were vastly different; their cultivation philosophies and ideas were worlds apart. They absolutely could not have been laid out by the same True Lord.

What put a huge stone in Xu Yunfan's heart slightly at ease was that when his divine sense swept over the avatar, he felt an extremely faint, almost imperceptible sense of control deep within its core true spirit.

Life and death at a single thought.

It was the binding seal cast by the 'Attribute Panel'!

'You have successfully cultivated the Cloud Library Avatar.'

'Your Cloud Library Avatar has been successfully bound.'

Guaranteed by the power of the system, the root of this avatar, differentiated from his own essence blood and true spirit, had been suppressed under the笼罩 of the attribute panel. There was absolutely no risk of betrayal or backlash!

This was a guarantee unique to him that the *Cloud Library* secret art itself did not even mention.

Only now could he feel a little at ease.

Even if his main body failed, he could still be reborn in the clone.

Xu Yunfan solemnly cupped his fists to the clone and said, "I must ask you to suffer, Daoist friend."

The clone's face showed a hint of bitterness. He dared not disobey the main body's command.

"It should be, it should be."

Seeing the clone's worried expression, Xu Yunfan reached out and patted his shoulder.

"We are one and the same. Your suffering is my pain. Broaden your perspective. Once we get through this, the good days are yet to come!"

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan glanced inconspicuously at the attribute panel, confirming that the clone was unaware of the system panel's strong control, and only then did he secretly let out a sigh of relief.

This was his greatest trump card.

The clone gave a bitter smile, naturally understanding what he was about to face.

He and Xu Yunfan were originally one. Thoughts could be transmitted by the main body, so he already knew the main body's decision without needing to be told.

"Come, it's time."

The main body, Xu Yunfan, said in a deep voice, staring intently at the clone. "Only by completely severing the karma with the *True Martial Subduing Demon True Scripture* and cultivating another method can we truly avoid the窥探 of those eyes hanging high in the nine heavens under the faint veil of the Heavenly Dao.

The Divine Martial World is the best hiding place. We are of the same origin in this world. Even if the Heavenly Dao is weak, it will instinctively protect you, a native living being."

Although the Divine Martial World was a small realm, even if the Heavenly Dao was the natural order of the world, all things seek survival, and a realm is no exception.

He was favored by the Divine Martial World, the embodiment of its luck, so it would naturally protect him.

The clone nodded solemnly. He had to nod. If he shook his head to refuse, the main body would definitely grab him, refine him in an instant, and create a new clone.

He sat cross-legged, hovering above the metallic ground, and began to operate the technique for scattering his cultivation.

In an instant, the clone's aura fluctuated violently.

The visible True Martial Evil Qi, the vast spiritual power from the *True Martial Subduing Demon True Scripture*, was forcibly pulled away by an invisible hand, seeping out from his four limbs and hundreds of bones. It made a faint "hissing" sound in the air filled with the Metal Element Qi of Gengjin, and was assimilated and dissolved, turning into the most primordial spiritual energy of heaven and earth and scattering in all directions.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't waste it. With a wave of his hand, he threw out sixteen formation flags, tightly gathering the scattered spiritual energy within a small area.

This spiritual energy transformed from the cultivation base couldn't be wasted.

It would be more than enough to help the clone cultivate all the way to the late stage of Qi Refining.

As long as the clone reached the late stage of Qi Refining, spiritual energy would be generated within his body. As long as he didn't use it recklessly, he could sustain himself.

The process of scattering one's cultivation was accompanied by pain akin to meridians snapping, and the violent impact of a Foundation Establishment realm's foundation shaking, making the clone's body tremble slightly and sweat beads form on his temples.

Each wisp of True Martial spiritual power that dissipated was like tearing away a part of his soul, but he gritted his teeth, his eyes clear, and didn't utter a single groan.

The main body, Xu Yunfan, watched quietly.

To discard one's cultivation and start over, to abandon one's past achievements—what great courage and sacrifice this was.

Of course, this was done by the clone. If he were to do it himself, then in the next moment, a large hand would probably descend from the heavens and refine him instantly...

"Only in this way can this clone truly become a 'hidden piece,' hiding in the Divine Martial World, avoiding the precise scan of that True Lord who views this world as a nursery. You are me, yet you will no longer be me... This is the path to survival in a desperate situation!"

Seeing the distortion in the clone's eyes, Xu Yunfan said calmly.

This was a crucial backup plan.

If the main body were to encounter an accident, Xu Yunfan only needed to move his mind slightly, and through the 'Divine Soul Exchange' secret art recorded in the *Xuandu Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Library*, he could instantly transfer his consciousness into this prepared avatar.

At that time, this clone, which carried the top-notch aptitude refined from countless spiritual materials and was protected by the Heavenly Dao of the Divine Martial World, would become the perfect vessel for his rebirth.

When the last wisp of the aura belonging to the True Martial Subduing Demon completely dissipated, the clone's face was as pale as paper, and his aura had dropped to the point of being nearly mortal. However, the 'brand' of the True Martial on his body had finally vanished, leaving only the pure, newly born spiritual body itself.

At this moment, the howling wind above the Suspended State seemed to quiet down for a moment. The invisible protective force from the Divine Martial World's Heavenly Dao seemed to wrap more noticeably around this avatar, trying its best to dilute and blend its existence into the vast, desolate golden world.

Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed slightly as he looked up at the sky.

As he had guessed, he was right.

Xu Yunfan said calmly, "Let's begin. Once you enter the door, you will have the power to protect yourself in the Divine Martial World."

The clone took a deep breath, adjusted his mind, and began to operate the supreme swordsmanship from the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect according to the thoughts transmitted by the main body.

*Myriad Chariots Sword Art.*

This sword art could be ranked among the top sword paths in the Taihua Void Realm. It was incredibly profound and pointed directly to the ultimate realm of the sword path.

Otherwise, how could the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect have named it the *Myriad Chariots Sword Art*?

Many profound sword arts within the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect were derived from the *Myriad Chariots Sword Art*. It was said to have been left by that Lord of the Dao and was extremely extraordinary.

If Xu Yunfan hadn't dug up Yu Congling's skin in the Ninggu Tower mine of the Divine Martial World that day, and ultimately subdued her and sent her into the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, he would never have been able to obtain such a divine skill.
