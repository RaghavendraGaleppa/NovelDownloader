# Chapter 151: Expanding Frontiers Provokes Urgency

Zhou Tao, who had been sitting cross-legged, suddenly stood up from the raptor's back, two golden beams shooting from his pupils. This time, he was leading the team, yet other elders' Miraculous Medicines were plucked away. This matter was too "crude."

In the dark night sky, the White Peacock radiated divine glow. "Elder Zhou," it said, "I advise you not to get agitated. Everything is according to the rules, as long as the red line isn't crossed."

…

Qin Ming didn't dare to venture deep into the Divine Ruin Plains, fearing he might run into a tough opponent.

However, he yearned for "advancement" and wanted to slay demons.

He knew that once he missed this place, it would be difficult to encounter wondrous creatures giving birth to Odd Blood again.

Qin Ming was very proactive, wanting to continue opening up new frontiers!

Since he couldn't delve deeper vertically, he decided to expand horizontally, going to support his acquaintances.

Qin Ming tallied his spoils, sending donkey hooves, Roc claws, four-colored feathers, elephant tusks, mountain ape finger bones, and other items to Stone Fortress Village overnight. These were proofs of demon subjugation.

"Young man, you alone... killed all those old demons?" The old village chief was shocked. What a glorious achievement!

Others were also terrified upon hearing this. In the past, wave after wave of young demon slayers came, unable to even deal with that old donkey, but now all the demons were annihilated!

Furthermore, some of the old demons weren't even in the records; they were casually killed by the youth before them, truly opening up new frontiers.

Qin Ming set off before the early night arrived. Even on the road, he was studying the *Arrow Scripture*. Every time he shot an arrow, he would quickly pursue it, practicing archery and traveling simultaneously.

Traveling through the vast, boundless forest, he felt no fatigue. The rich Verdant Wood Essence was constantly nourishing his flesh, blood, and spirit.

Hu Family Village, a relatively large settlement with many blue-brick and grey-tiled houses, housed over six hundred people. The Tier-2 fire spring in the village was exceptionally bright.

After arriving in this area, Qin Ming naturally first inquired with the locals, asking if there were any vicious demons nearby.

The village chief stood under an old locust tree, a smile on his face. "Young man, you've come too late," he said. "Recently, a young lady, as beautiful as a fairy stepping out of a painting, helped us eliminate the demons and resolved the troubles."

"Look, here she comes," the village chief pointed.

Zhuo Ya appeared, approaching gracefully. Dressed in black, her fair and delicate face appeared rather cold and enchanting. This was an outlier even stronger than Cao Wuji.

"Why did you come to my side?" Zhuo Ya asked with a smile. She was Yu Zhuohan's cousin. "Do you want me to punch you to get revenge for my cousin?"

When they first met, she was quite aloof, but upon closer acquaintance, one would find that her smile, like a blooming snow lotus, was surprisingly brilliant.

Qin Ming chuckled, "Yu Zhuohan and I became friends through fighting; I don't believe he's that petty. I came purely to help. Are there any old demons here that are difficult to slay?"

Suddenly, he took down the silver bow carved with cloud patterns, aimed at an iron-beaked parrot on a large willow tree not far away, and was about to release an arrow.

"Spare me, I mean no harm! Heavens, how can I encounter you even here?" The iron-beaked parrot shrieked miserably.

"Don't kill it!" Zhuo Ya quickly stopped him.

"What's going on?" Qin Ming was puzzled. In recent days, bird demons had constantly been spying, and after he consecutively shot down several of them, it had finally become much quieter.

"It's a subordinate tamed by the White Peacock, patrolling various territories..." Zhuo Ya informed him. This was considered a form of protection for them; if an "accident" outside the rules occurred, the White Peacock would intervene.

The iron-beaked parrot cried tears of agony, saying, "Recently, it's been circulating in our bird realm: never go to the territories of the Black Roc or the Fire-Scaled Lion. Nine of our bird brothers on patrol there were shot down."

Qin Ming was stunned. Among the bird demons he had shot, there were actually spies from the Six Oracles?

"Who told you not to say anything beforehand?"

"There was no chance at all! Who would have thought your intuition was so sharp and your archery so terrifying? Later, we just decided to observe from afar; no bird dared to approach you." The iron-beaked parrot never imagined that even after changing patrol routes, it would still encounter this bringer of death, almost losing its bird life.

The village chief of Hu Family Village was shocked. This young man had truly swept through and eradicated all the old demons in that region?!

He immediately became energetic, as if injected with stimulants. "Young man," he said, "there is indeed a demon here that no one dares to touch. Although it hasn't crossed the line itself, its descendants occasionally cause bloody incidents."

"What kind of demon?" Qin Ming asked.

"A white flood dragon from the Flood Dragon Palace," the village chief enthusiastically informed him.

"A flood dragon living in a palace?" Qin Ming's interest was piqued. This should be a very significant unconventional creature.

Zhuo Ya, whose features were as picturesque as a painting, now looked solemn. She shook her head. "That white flood dragon possesses great spiritual intelligence and profound cultivation," she said. "We cannot deal with it."

She had gone to observe it but ultimately gave up, not daring to make a move.

Upon hearing of its high spiritual intelligence, Qin Ming became even more expectant. Could it have given birth to "Odd Blood"? The value of such a creature was immense; outside, it couldn't be bought even with Luminous Gold.

In fact, ordinary people wouldn't even hear rumors about them.

Seeing that he insisted on going and was preparing to act alone, Zhuo Ya eventually followed him, helping to guide the way.

A magnificent building stood in the forest ahead, accompanied by a Tier-3 fire spring that illuminated the area as bright as day. The lush leaves of the trees revealed their true colors, no longer a shadowy mass.

"This white flood dragon dominates sixty percent of this territory, and its strength is extremely formidable," Zhuo Ya informed him, her slender figure tensed like a cheetah, ready to flee at any moment.

In earlier years, this white flood dragon caused significant trouble, demanding large offerings of cattle and sheep from various villages, clearly considering itself a god. Later, for unknown reasons, it no longer dared to cross the boundaries of the frontier.

Soon after, Qin Ming saw the fabled white flood dragon. It swam out from the colossal palace, entered the Tier-3 fire spring, and churned up waves of vibrant, bright red.

It was as thick as a water vat, entirely white like ivory, and fifteen to sixteen meters long. When its scales flared, a clanging sound could be heard from a distance, indicating they were undoubtedly as hard as refined iron.

A single horn, bearing a faint golden luster, grew on its head, and its eyes were crimson like blood diamonds.

Qin Ming's eyes sparkled. He had encountered more than one creature that had given birth to Odd Blood. Based on his intuition, he believed this white flood dragon was likely among them!

"This area truly is special." He pondered, "Is the so-called Divine Ruin a place where a god fell, and myriad things grew, thus giving birth to some Odd Blood creatures?"

"This white flood dragon's bloodline is extremely unique," Zhuo Ya stated.

Qin Ming was surprised and looked back at her.

"You knew too, and you came for its Odd Blood!" Zhuo Ya instantly understood, a strange look appearing on her face. *This guy is truly bold! Is he risking his life for Odd Blood? That white flood dragon is simply not something they can deal with in their current state, unless they cultivate the Six Oracles Energy.*

Qin Ming said, "I stumbled upon it by chance, and its uses are infinite, so I want to expand the frontiers and continue searching for such creatures."

Clearly, although Zhuo Ya came from an impressive background and knew about Odd Blood creatures, she was unaware that the "wild medicines" here had long been targeted by the elders of the Six Oracles Ancestral Court.

She informed him, "I also hunted one, and nearly lost my life. I only succeeded in demon subjugation by employing Esoteric Sect methods. Before learning the Six Oracles Energy, I couldn't even budge the demons here."

Qin Ming was surprised. "You and Yu Zhuohan have profound family legacies. Could you both be descendants of Esoteric Sect masters?"

Zhuo Ya frankly stated, "I have the Esoteric Sect's legacy, but in the early stages, I lacked protective methods, so I wanted to learn the Six Oracles Energy."

Qin Ming immediately realized that she was similar to Lu Yuzhi, who had entered the Jade Purity Sect.

"Walking two paths simultaneously, can you manage? And will the Six Oracles Ancestral Court agree?"

Zhuo Ya said, "It's not a big problem. My elders at home have already negotiated with the elders here. I'll pursue the Esoteric Sect's path to godhood within the Six Oracles, never leaving the Ancestral Court, and certainly not divulging the Six Oracles Mind Scripture. Otherwise, my entire clan would be implicated. In truth, the Six Oracles elders also very much hope for outliers who walk two paths simultaneously to stay."

Qin Ming immediately realized that the Six Oracles Ancestral Court was studying the paths of external realms and the Esoteric Sect, wanting to try combining them. That's why they accepted unique outliers like Zhuo Ya.

Great sect ancestral courts like the Six Oracles, Jade Purity, and Heaven-Sustaining Sect all didn't want to decline with the passing of their patriarchs and were actively seeking survival.

"He really dares!" Zhuo Ya retreated a considerable distance, watching in astonishment as the young man who had defeated her cousin made his move.

Qin Ming stood on a high ground, silver bow in hand, nocking a jade-iron arrow onto the string, and commenced his flood dragon slaying operation.

In an instant, the black jade-iron arrow, radiating terrifying light like a miniature sun, shot out at extreme speed, striking the white flood dragon's head.

With a bang, scales shattered and flesh became a bloody mess. The first arrow wounded it; had its intuition not been sharp, its left eye would have been pierced by that single shot.

Now, it reared up to six meters tall, its flood dragon body twisting as it crushed through the forest, charging towards Qin Ming at high speed, exuding immense pressure.

During this process, Qin Ming emptied twelve black jade-iron arrows, all striking its head. Not a single arrow missed, almost piercing through parts of its skull.

The thirteenth, and final, blue jade-iron arrow was fired, successfully bursting one of its eyes.

Zhuo Ya was dazed. How could his Skyglow Energy be so powerful? Could it be that he had learned the Six Oracles Mind Scripture ahead of time?!

Qin Ming, wielding his suet jade-iron blade, charged forward, clashing head-on with the great flood dragon. Every strike drew blood, sending the white flood dragon's scales scattering.

This great flood dragon was rich in combat experience. Although heavily wounded, it remained calm. Its flood dragon body coiled, trying to ensnare its opponent.

At the same time, its single horn astonishingly shot out bolts of lightning, its offensive power quite terrifying.

If it were another Outer Saint, they would likely be pierced by the light beams shot from its golden horn.

Qin Ming was fearless. He had learned the Wind-Thunder Energy and could deal with it.

He employed the Blade Control Art, making the suet jade-iron blade revolve around himself, preventing the flood dragon's body from getting close and ensnaring him.

At the same time, he used Wind-Thunder Energy to neutralize the lightning. This was significantly weaker than the natural lightning that descended last night, and he could control it, somewhat restraining the white flood dragon.

Finally, Qin Ming unleashed his unified Skyglow Energy, which also allowed him to control his blade, hacking the flood dragon's body into a bloody mess, revealing its bones.

Immediately, he leaped up, soaring six or seven meters into the air, his fists erupting with light like blazing suns, striking out punch after punch.

The white flood dragon was terrified. Its head was already severely wounded, and now encountering such unparalleled Skyglow Energy, it could no longer resist.

With a *crack*, the white flood dragon's faint golden horn was smashed off by Qin Ming's fist, and its skull shattered.

*Pffft!*

Qin Ming swung his suet jade-iron blade, severing the colossal flood dragon head!

This white flood dragon was more formidable than the Black Roc, but it was still slain.

"You definitely practiced Six Oracles Energy in advance, didn't you?" Zhuo Ya rushed over and asked.

"Yes, keep it a secret," Qin Ming chuckled, quickly extracting the "Odd Blood," which was a faint golden color, similar to the horn's hue.

"The horn and the flood dragon gall are all yours," Qin Ming said, then looked at the iron-beaked parrot. "Don't go reporting carelessly."

The bird demon trembled, genuinely afraid he would shoot it down with an arrow.

"Where are you going?" Zhuo Ya saw that Qin Ming was refining the medicinal properties of the Odd Blood with Skyglow Energy as he walked, and he was clearly heading for a distant place.

Qin Ming said, "I'm going to help Cao Wuji and the others. As fellow participants in the assessment, we should help each other."

…

"What? The Miraculous Medicine in Zhuo Ya's territory was also plucked clean? Quick, send out the notice, time's up, the assessment is over, call them back immediately!"

When Elder Zhou Tao heard the news, he completely lost his composure. Someone was opening up new frontiers and, incidentally, taking all the Miraculous Medicines. This made him immediately anxious.
