# Chapter 568: The Celestial Pivot Splits the Golden Vajra Sword Qi

Xu Yunfan transformed into a dazzling purple lightning light, as fast as a bolt of lightning.

He did not pause for a moment, charging straight towards Nezha's God-General who was thrusting his Fire-tipped Spear at him.

In the instant he rushed towards the youth, a sword of ancient style, with a blade as deep as ink but a spine flowing with a thin silver-white electric arc, was already in his hand.

It was the True Martial Sword.

Although Xu Yunfan had not cultivated the True Martial Subdues Demons Sutra, this sword was itself a top-tier artifact for slaughter, and he naturally would not give it up.

The heavy karma carried by the long sword had long been cut away cleanly by the Patriarch of Pure Yang's 'One Sword Without Return'. Now, when wielding it, there was no longer any obstruction; on the contrary, he felt it was perfectly suited to him because of the pure demonic-slaying power contained within the sword's body.

Thunder exterminates evil, True Martial subdues demons—Xu Yunfan had once cultivated these.

Now, using them, they naturally complemented each other.

"Come得好!"

Seeing Xu Yunfan transform into a flash of lightning and charge forward with his sword, Nezha let out a furious roar. His handsome face was filled with unyielding spirit and桀骜 (arrogance). The glint on the Fire-tipped Spear in his hand suddenly magnified, carrying the sharpness to pierce through the void, and fiercely stabbed towards the source of the lightning.

*CHING!!!*

The sword tip and the spear tip collided precisely in mid-air.

There was no earth-shattering explosion, only a piercing sound that seemed to tear at the soul, shattering the eardrums.

A visible shockwave spread violently from the point of impact, instantly scraping away a layer of soil and rock within a ten-zhang range below. Several unlucky Qi-cultivating cultivators and heavenly soldiers nearby were pulverized into dust before they could even let out a scream.

A hint of surprise flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. He felt an overbearing, peerless force carrying the power of burning and destruction surging along the sword's body, irresistible.

However, he cultivated the Profound Void Undying Scripture of the Nine Heavens of Divine Thunder, and had long since forged a physique far exceeding that of his peers through the sun and moon's pivot and the tempering of thunder.

He let out a soft snort, not foolish enough to take the blow head-on. The lightning around him dimmed suddenly, and his entire body was pushed back over a dozen zhang by the aftermath of the pure power collision. Every step he took left a faint ripple of lightning patterns in the void.

Although his opponent was at the early stage of Foundation Establishment, this physical strength, combined with the sharpness of the Fire-tipped Spear, was truly overbearing.

Moreover, within this divine power, there was a faint, peculiar binding force that interfered with his spiritual energy circulation.

This cultivation system of the celestial realm was somewhat different from that of the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm.

The youth before him, who resembled Nezha, held a spear whose magical power vibrated, yet he displayed various Dao techniques through martial arts.

"Interesting."

Xu Yunfan's eyes focused. Although the previous strike hadn't used his full power, it gave him a clearer understanding of the youth's strength.

More importantly, the Wind Fire Wheels, Fire-tipped Spear, Heavenly Silk Ribbon, Universe Ring...

They were truly too similar!

Could this so-called celestial realm truly be related to the Journey to the West mythology from his memories?

If that were the case, then it wouldn't just be one Dao Fruit?

Xu Yunfan's heart couldn't help but pound with excitement.

Legend had it that the Peach Garden, the Grand Pure Palace, the Dao Fruits of the Heavenly Court behind the South Heaven Gate...

Xu Yunfan's heart instantly grew hot.

The opportunity of one celestial realm was already immense. If it were truly the legendary mythological world, it would be an unimaginable fortune.

If that were true, he wondered if the True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect and the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect could withstand it.

His thoughts raced, but his hands did not stop.

With a thought from Xu Yunfan, the innate divine art he had achieved at the early Foundation Establishment stage, the Battle Secret Method 'Battle Character', was fiercely activated.

*BOOM!*

Vast physical energy and pure magical power were instantly ignited.

The rapidly rising power and surging magical power within his body gave him a soaring battle intent from the bottom of his heart, one that looked down upon heaven and earth and revered only himself.

It rose from the depths of his soul and instantly filled his limbs and bones.

The power of the celestial stars seemed to be drawn by an unseen force, and countless, hard-to-see glimmers of starlight penetrated the boundary membrane and融入 (merged into) his body.

His originally steady thunder aura suddenly became fierce and violent.

He seemed to transform into a deity bathing in infinite lightning, holding dominion over the thunder of the Divine霄 (Xiao) heavens.

The youth opposite him, the God-General, also adopted a solemn expression upon seeing this.

He had been an immortal for a long time, but he never expected this outsider demon to be so troublesome. What shocked him most was that lightning flickered with the opponent's every movement, as if he wielded it as easily as his own arm.

This forced him to focus all his attention.

"The Celestial Pivot Splits Gold, Majestic Heavenly Might, Slash."

Xu Yunfan let out a clear cry, and the lightning on the True Martial Sword surged like writhing thunder serpents.

This was the only offensive sword technique studied in the *Profound Void Undying Scripture of the Nine Heavens of Divine Thunder*, aside from its lightning arts.

The Celestial Pivot Splits the Golden Vajra Sword Qi!

The Celestial Pivot Splits the Golden Vajra Sword Qi was the sole sword technique within the *Profound Void Undying Scripture of the Nine Heavens of Divine Thunder*.

Instead of retreating, he advanced. His figure vanished from its original spot once more, not charging in a straight line but leaving afterimages in the void along an unpredictable trajectory, like the shifting of constellations.

The True Martial Sword in his hand suddenly slashed out.

In an instant, a thousand strands of sword qi, as fine as hair and condensed to the extreme, filled the vast space before him like starlight bursting out of thin air.

This sword qi contained the sharpness of metal, the transformation of庚金 (Yang Metal), and at its core, was powered by supreme thunder. It was fierce and unmatched, best at tearing through protective auras and breaking solid artifacts.

Each strand of sword qi was like a miniature Exterminating Evil Thunder, with electricity jumping and crackling, carrying a destructive penetrating power. It enveloped Nezha like a heavenly net.

Nezha's pupils contracted slightly, his crimson golden eyes reflecting this destructive net of electricity capable of cutting through gold and jade.

The Wind Fire Wheels beneath his feet flared with intense flames, and his figure retreated rapidly like a line of fire. At the same time, his wrist flipped, and the Fire-tipped Spear changed from a thrust to a sweep, drawing a massive ring of fire.

"Scorching Heaven Flame Wheel!"

A scorching wave of fire erupted violently, colliding head-on with the golden lightning sword qi that filled the sky.

*BOOM, RUMBLE, RUMBLE!*

Purple electric serpents and crimson flames intertwined frantically, then continuously collided and annihilated each other.

The vibration of the two sides' magical power, and the energy storm formed by the sword qi and spear flames, whipped up a hurricane dozens of zhang high.

Before the supreme yang thunder, the flames were actually suppressed, continuously torn apart and burned away.

However, the power contained in that flame wheel was also extremely formidable, forcefully burning and shattering most of the Splitting Gold Sword Qi.

Still, several crafty strands of sword qi passed through the gaps in the flames. With a few hissing sounds, they left deep, scorched marks on Nezha's crimson golden lotus leaf armor, and even a trace of thunderfire seeped in through the gaps.

"Demon!"

Nezha grunted in pain. The Heavenly Silk Ribbon shot out instantly, wrapping around his body like a spirit snake. With a flash of red light, it extinguished the invading thunderfire.

"Demon?"

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and lifted the True Martial Sword in his hand.

"My Dao arts and divine abilities all follow the path of Divine Thunder. How can that be considered a demon?"

Nezha's eyes burned with even greater fury. The initial underestimation in his gaze was gone, replaced by extreme solemnness.

This demon's lightning arts were so克制 (suppressive) to his fire-based divine abilities.

The black sword in his hand was even more sinister, carrying a supreme killing intent that made his primordial spirit tingle with pain.

Xu Yunfan, however, was now completely calm and collected.
