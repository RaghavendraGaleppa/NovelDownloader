Chapter 267: Martial Accumulation, Faction Formation, and the Golden Light Prototype

Li Xian scanned his internal state; the essence of heaven and earth had been completely digested. The Food Essence realm was perfectly complete, and signs of the Great Plain realm were beginning to appear. Consuming the "Yellow Nine Ginseng" was now the top priority.

He had been fleeing for days, now over a hundred miles away from Embroidery City. Hidden within the vast sea of people, how could the Luo family of Embroidery City possibly find him? Seeing that everything was stable and that Wen Caishang and the others from the One Harmony Manor had yet to catch up, he figured it would be difficult for them to track him down.

"Su Qiuwu and Zhao Zhiyuan pursued me relentlessly, yet I still shook them off. It was partly luck, but regarding the art of escape... I suppose I have gained some experience."

Feeling a bit self-satisfied, his mind eased slightly. He began planning the consumption of the "Yellow Nine Ginseng." The recipe for Golden Light required drinking Golden Scales, swallowing Nine Ginseng, and eating Yellow Dew. Drinking Golden Scales required a creature with scales and a tail, drawing upon the nature of swimming fish. Swallowing Nine Ginseng required that no stray light enters...

Li Xian pondered: "If I rent a room in an inn, there will be gaps in the doors and windows, allowing stray light to enter. With people coming and going, it is inevitable that I will be disturbed. When swallowing the Yellow Nine Ginseng, I cannot move, nor can I be touched by stray light..."

He said to himself: "I need to rent a courtyard. Hidden deep within a mansion, I can be free from disturbance."

He was now in "Prosperous Scenery City," located in the northeast of the Poor Heaven Prefecture. Traveling for a few more days, he would enter the Heavy Ridge Prefecture. Li Xian marveled at the vastness of the territory; just the Poor Heaven Prefecture alone was enough to travel for a long time.

Great clans occupied land as their sovereign, monopolizing resources, leaving ordinary people to swallow their grievances and suffer. But because the land was vast and rich, even if the situation was chaotic, the population remained dense.

Li Xian patted his bag, calculating the remaining silver. He searched his whole body; he only had thirty-seven taels left. For ordinary travel and staying at inns, this was plenty. Occasionally, he could even drink and eat meat, living freely and elegantly.

He needed to use this silver to prepare a suitable place to consume the "Yellow Nine Ginseng." He wandered around and saw a few vacant courtyards that seemed quite suitable. They contained hidden rooms that were quiet and free from stray light.

Li Xian thought: "If I could sneak into the hidden room of a mansion and take it calmly, that would be perfect." However, even if the courtyards in the city were vacant, they already had owners. People came daily to clean and patrol. With Li Xian's lightness skill, hiding would naturally be easy. But during consumption, he couldn't move. If he were discovered, it would be terrible.

If he left the city to search for a cave to take it, finding a cave by touching the mountains and probing the waters would require effort. Moreover, with "demons" rampant, there would inevitably be disturbances.

Consuming "Essence Treasures" is especially likely to attract demons. Li Xian selected a residence located in the east of the city, in a rather remote location.

After careful consideration, he knew that ordinary methods would make it difficult to use this mansion. So he took a different approach and went straight to a clothing shop, using all his remaining money to buy brocade clothes, hair crowns, sachets, and jade pendants...

It didn't take long.

Li Xian looked completely new. He was draped in silk and brocade, noble and elegant, handsome and spirited, with an ethereal aura. His hair crown and red mole added to his distinct and imposing presence. Standing there, passersby whispered and discussed him, and women stared in a daze.

His Pure Yang physique added a unique charm.

Li Xian looked in the mirror and was very satisfied: "With this style, I really look like a noble young master." He went straight to the residence in the east of the city and waited quietly in front of the vermilion gate for a moment. Pedestrians on the street saw him and whispered secretly. People in tea shops and wine towers recognized the owner of the residence and sent someone to inform him.

It wasn't long before a middle-aged man ran over, cupping his hands and saying: "Young Master, are you... interested in this mansion?"

Li Xian nodded and said: "This Young Master is traveling through here and finds the scenery quite nice. Go call your master over!"

Not long after.

A man wearing brocade and with a thick, fat figure approached. This man was named "Tian Fu," a member of the "Tian" family in the city. This mansion had been listed for sale for years; occasionally people came to look at the house and ask the price, but a deal had never been reached.

Tian Fu saw Li Xian and was suddenly startled. Seeing the young master's indescribable handsomeness and tall, straight figure, he dared not look down on him. He took a few quick steps and said: "Young Master, do you want to buy the house? There is a 'Drunken Spring Manor' nearby. Shall we go inside and discuss it?"

Li Xian said: "No need. If we are to discuss, we shall do so inside the mansion." Tian Fu happily said: "Good, very good!" He led the way in front and pushed open the vermilion gate.

Tian Fu said: "My mansion is warm in winter and cool in summer, covering a vast area. Alas, if not for the fact that I have been living with the family recently, helping them manage affairs and having little time to return, I really wouldn't be willing to sell it."

Li Xian saw a huge stone and nodded slightly. Tian Fu said: "Young Master probably doesn't know, this huge stone has a great history, it is..."

Li Xian said: "How could I not know? The east side of this stone is yellow, the west side is green. The texture is smooth, like jade but not jade. From afar, it has the feel of amber; up close, it has the charm of stone pine. This is 'Green Pine Stone'."

"If I am not mistaken, your Green Pine Stone was obtained at the foot of Su Mountain."

Tian Fu was shocked: "How did Young Master see through it?" He was astonished by Li Xian's appreciation and the noble background revealed in his speech.

Li Xian smiled: "Strange stones under heaven, none surpass Su Mountain. Strange pines under heaven, none surpass Su Mountain. I have an uncle-in-law who is in this business, how could I not know."

"Ah!" Tian Fu said: "Young Master... then... what is your esteemed surname?"

Li Xian smiled and shook his head: "I am here to buy a mansion, unwilling to entangle family relationships. Let's not speak of it. If I am interested, I will buy it. Just lead the way."

"Good! Good!" Tian Fu already felt restrained. Seeing Li Xian's demeanor and speech, his appearance and aura were impeccable. He must be from an extremely powerful force.

The two walked side by side. Every time they passed a courtyard scene, Li Xian spoke eloquently, explaining the allusions and meanings, fully displaying his taste and knowledge. Tian Fu was deeply convinced. Although he knew the general purpose of the courtyard scenery, he couldn't speak about it as clearly as Li Xian.

After walking for more than a quarter of an hour, they passed a water channel in the courtyard. The channel was about three zhang wide, with artificial rocks and flowers placed on both sides... imitating a green river. At this time, the situation was chaotic, and local clans felt deeply insecure, yet they also harbored ambitions to contend for the world.

Local powerhouses with great ambitions liked to bring magnificent landscapes of mountains and rivers into their family mansions, arranging them into unique scenery. This secretly contained the meaning of holding the world in their chest, with infinite ambition. They were afraid that others wouldn't notice, yet also afraid that others would notice.

Li Xian smiled: "I didn't expect to see a 'River-Flipping Carp' in such a small place."

A "gray carp" swam freely in the channel. It was very domineering, its tail whipping golden carps, its mouth biting red fish. It acted like a king in the channel.

Li Xian smiled and asked: "Do you have the ambition to dominate?"

Tian Fu sweated, deeply shocked by Li Xian's insight, actually seeing the hidden meaning from the courtyard scenery. He said: "It's really embarrassing... this courtyard scenery was set up when I was young and didn't know the immensity of heaven and earth, spending money to arrange it. Every time I pass here, I can't help but blush. Please forgive my laughable display."

Li Xian said: "Living in this world, what one seeks is nothing more than the four words 'secure a foothold and establish a life.' Even if you didn't say it, I saw it. Your courtyard is about thirty years old. The initial scenery was magnificent and grand, with the intention of copying heaven and earth. The later expanded scenery, however, is inclusive and reserved, down-to-earth."

Tian Fu was extremely respectful.

Li Xian lightly flicked his hand, rippling the water in the channel, playing with the River-Flipping Carp. Tian Fu's expression changed: "Young Master, this River-Flipping Carp has a fierce temperament, don't play with it! Otherwise, it will bite and draw blood, fighting back ferociously. If it's useless... it will smash its head against a rock and commit suicide."

The River-Flipping Carp is an extremely precious ornamental fish for courtyards. It only appears when dragons dance and winds stir waves, or when rivers flip. A single one costs "seven hundred taels."

The price is indeed inflated, but... it truly cannot be cheap. This carp has a fierce temperament and is very difficult to raise. It requires the "Fish Guild" to carefully train it, keeping its fierce nature while allowing it to live in a courtyard lake. That is why it is popular among people.

Li Xian smiled: "It's fine. It just depends on who is playing with it." He flicked it a few times, and the River-Flipping Carp actually showed complete docility.

He carried the Dragon Qi and had bathed in Dragon Soup. Even if the River-Flipping Carp was fierce, how dare it act recklessly in front of him.

Tian Fu was greatly shocked and felt even more respect, his attitude becoming restrained.

Li Xian had a thick face and said: "A fish like the River-Flipping Carp is slightly expensive, the price is for the 'rarity.' But under the heavens, no matter how rare a thing is, it is not rare to me. Not to mention playing with it, my nephew caught a few to eat just a few days ago."

"Ah!"

Tian Fu's legs trembled; he was completely intimidated. He said: "Young... Young Master... you have... great wealth." The River-Flipping Carp is extremely rare. If it were just "seven hundred taels" of silver, a family power could afford it. But when the Fish Guild sells the carp, they need to investigate the family's background.

There is a saying: "The noble carp does not enter a poor family."所谓的 "poor family" refers to a local powerhouse. For the Tian family to buy the River-Flipping Carp, they spent several thousand taels on connections. Even so... for the second and third River-Flipping Carps, the Fish Guild refused to sell them no matter what.

Therefore... having a pond full of River-Flipping Carps is secondary to financial power. Their family background must have a great connection with the Fish Guild.

Li Xian said: "Alright, I am tired of walking." Tian Fu quickly shouted: "Uncle Wang, quickly bring a jade stool!"

Uncle Wang moved deftly and brought a jade stool. Tian Fu, to show his eagerness, took the stool a few steps ahead and personally placed it beside Li Xian, smiling: "Young Master, please sit."

Li Xian smiled: "You are too polite." He brushed his brocade robe and sat down generously.

Tian Fu said: "It is as it should be, as it should be. Then, Young Master, you see..." With such speech and insight, there was absolutely no possibility of pretense. He had arranged the courtyard himself, including furniture, scenery, and feng shui. He understood the inside story best and was naturally deeply shocked.

Tian Fu said: "If Young Master is interested, perhaps... perhaps you could come to my family. We can discuss it in detail and definitely reach a result satisfactory to both parties."

He wanted to recruit a connection and decided to suffer a small loss to sell the residence.

"That is not necessary," Li Xian smiled. "I buy courtyards without looking at the price. Moreover... I already have a number in mind for the price. If I like it, I can buy it directly."

"Is that so..." Tian Fu was extremely disappointed. But thinking that if Li Xian could really live here, building a relationship and establishing connections... that could be done slowly.

Tian Fu said: "Then you are..."

Li Xian's eyes narrowed slightly, his fingers tapping gently on the jade edge, and he said leisurely: "I prefer quietness. The garden scenery, artificial mountains, and pond water here... are actually not very brilliant. But the quiet charm is quite to my taste."

"How about this, I will try living here for a few days. You must not disturb me. If it is acceptable, I will buy it."

Tian Fu was overjoyed; he couldn't ask for more.

Li Xian said: "Drive all the people away. There is no need to entertain me. I am not interested; it would only disturb my peaceful sleep."

Tian Fu said: "Young Master is a refined person. Good, good, please rest." Not daring to disturb, he called the guards and servants in the mansion to leave.

After they left the mansion.

Tian family servant Uncle Wang asked: "Master, are we just going to let him live like this? What if he is a swindler..."

Tian Fu said: "Nonsense. This gentleman is knowledgeable. The way he appreciates and identifies objects requires decades of cultivation to have such insight. And look at his temperament and appearance; how could he be a swindler?"

Uncle Wang said: "But... I looked at his clothes, they don't seem very luxurious."

Tian Fu said: "Ridiculous. Do clothes need to be expensive? Even if you carried thousands of gold on your shoulders, could you match that young master's demeanor?"

Uncle Wang said: "Yes, yes... that is true!" He suddenly understood.

Inside the courtyard. Li Xian's plan went smoothly; he had tricked his way into the residence for three to five days, which he figured was more than enough time to consume the "Yellow Nine Ginseng." He sat elegantly and quietly for half an hour. Once all the personnel had left, he went straight to the hidden room.

He kept a close watch on the time. He waited until the "Mao period" (5-7 AM) to begin.

The hidden room was dark and dim, the stone door thick and heavy. Servants came to clean it daily, so there was no accumulated dust. Inside, there was a bed, a desk, and a meditation cushion, and nothing else.

Li Xian sat cross-legged on the cushion.

Adjusting his breath, focusing his mind and calming his spirit, and having no other thoughts, he took out a candle. The candle was three inches long, made from boiled fish fat, and could burn for three days. When lit, the flame was gentle and not easily extinguished.

Li Xian lit the candle. With everything ready, he stared at the candle, watching the wax melt and the candle shorten by three millimeters, then immediately consumed the "Yellow Nine Ginseng" velvet.

[You consumed Human Yellow · Yellow Nine Ginseng, Skill Consumption, Proficiency +79]

[Art of the Way · Unknown... Proficiency +1]

Li Xian's breathing was steady, and he was patient. Every time the candle shortened by three millimeters, he drank the ginseng velvet. The hidden room was pitch black, unaware of the passage of time... but from the length of the candle, one could vaguely distinguish the time.

One day passed.

[You consumed Human Yellow · Yellow Nine Ginseng, Skill Consumption Proficiency +32]

When consuming the same Essence Treasure for a long time, the proficiency gain will decrease. Li Xian already knew this from his time at "Bear and Tiger Mountain."

[Art of the Way · Golden Light Prototype]

[Proficiency: 46/100]

Li Xian's consumption took effect, and the Art of the Way changed from "Unknown" to "Golden Light Prototype." He kept his mind steady and his body still, not moving a fraction. Another day passed, and the proficiency of the Art of the Way · Golden Light reached [56]...

On the third morning.

Li Xian successfully emerged from seclusion. The proficiency of [Art of the Way · Golden Light Prototype] had reached [71]. Consuming [Morning Yellow Dew] next would grant him the Art of Golden Light.

[Skill · Consumption]

[Proficiency: 2969/3000 (Great Completion)]

The gains from seclusion were abundant. Li Xian stretched his limbs. Having sat still for three days, the moment he moved, a "cracking" sound rang out. Tian Fu and the others kept their promise and did not inquire for three days.

There was still the head of the "Yellow Nine Ginseng" in the Heaven and Earth Box. Li Xian's "Consumption" skill possessed the "Appreciation" characteristic, so when consuming Human Yellow, the required amount was very little.

Wen Caishang had once told him that each type of "Heavenly Essence," "Earthly Flower," and "Human Yellow" could only be consumed once in a lifetime. Li Xian had consumed "Golden Scales" and "Yellow Nine Ginseng"... and there was still "Yellow Nine Ginseng" left. If he also had "Golden Scales," he could consume "Golden Scales" later.

The recipe would be: Golden Scales, Yellow Nine Ginseng, Golden Scales. Such a combination would definitely be useless. It would instead disrupt the original recipe, making it difficult to accurately grasp the Art of the Way when consuming the third Essence Treasure.

Golden Scales, Yellow Nine Ginseng, Yellow Nine Ginseng... this combination is the same principle. Therefore, Human Yellow Essence Treasures are shared among heroes. It is not only because Human Yellow is precious and rare, but also because of an indescribable reason.

Lu Dongzhi consumed "Heavenly Kui," "Earthly Kui," and "Sword Tomb Yellow"... due to the order, he obtained the Art "Legacy Dream." After obtaining the Art, "Heavenly Kui" and "Earthly Kui" still had residue. Why didn't he continue to consume them to piece together the Art of Sword Control?

It was because he had already consumed all three Essence Treasures. Even if he disrupted the order and consumed them again, it would be ineffective. Precisely because of this, he was free and easy, using Heavenly Essence and Earthly Flower to seduce women.

Li Xian hid the 'Yellow Nine Ginseng.' If he encounters a desired Essence Treasure in the future, he can trade Essence for Essence to gain benefits.

Birds chirped softly in the courtyard, and the spring flowers were full of vitality. It was now the early tenth day of the sixth month. Since Li Xian began practicing martial arts, he had been running about busily every day. Now, through deception and temptation, he had obtained three days of quiet residence.

He moved a small stool over and sat quietly with a relaxed mind. Suddenly, he thought: "One day... if I enter the Three Realms, I too will need to find a place, acquire some property, and prepare a set of courtyards. After practicing martial arts, I will have the leisure and elegance to play the zither, paint and write, dance and watch plays, raise cranes and play with fish, or... capture a few beauties and have a good time..."

"Traveling leisurely with beauties, admiring scenery and shopping. That kind of taste, even immortals wouldn't exchange for it. If that day truly comes, I could bring my younger brother over. Alas! My younger brother has high aspirations and is dedicated to his studies, but he refuses to marry a wife. That is not good, but since that is his ambition, should I hinder him?"

"With strength in hand, if the Mistress dares to act arrogantly, I will capture her all at once. Dress her in silk clothes and lock her in a deep mansion."

Li Xian had a smile on his face, but the world was extremely chaotic. The Great Wu Dynasty was restoring its might, sweeping the world. Or... the Hundred Schools would rise together, contending for power and profit. Under a shattered nest, how can there be a whole egg? Wen Caishang's strength was formidable, and the manor held countless treasures. Facing the "Yellow Dragon" rebel army, she also "avoided its锋芒."

Many people become a crowd, and a crowd forms a trend.

Where the trend points, one can only avoid its锋芒. How difficult it is to secure a foothold and establish a life.

Li Xian thought about the future and indulged in fantasies. He had always been down-to-earth, believing that Heaven rewards the diligent. It was rare for him to be idle and quiet, and his usual miscellaneous thoughts surged forth. But he did not indulge in them, and instead rekindled his ambition, seeking the peak of martial arts only.

He had been exhausted from fleeing recently. Now he finally had some free time. After finishing the consumption of the "Yellow Nine Ginseng," he took out "Art of the Way · Blood Flesh Regeneration" and "Blood Training Three Classics."

"That Black-Faced Bat King muttered 'Master' and such before he died. Could there be a master behind him? His martial arts were very evil, but his strength was good. He was also a character with great luck, obtaining an Art early on."

"This Art of the Way · Blood Flesh Regeneration is quite ingenious. Let me see what it looks like."

The recipe was a yellow paper made of beast skin. It recorded: Human Yellow · Blood Drop Seed, Human Yellow · Yellow Light, Human Yellow · Bitter Bodhi.

There are many ways to consume it. How to consume it and when to consume it is like a ritual. Li Xian thought: "The Essence Treasures for this Art of the Way are quite ordinary, but the method of consumption is more complex than that of the Golden Light Art."

At the bottom of the recipe, the effects of the Art were recorded. "Blood Flesh Regeneration" uses blood to transform muscle,附骨生肉 (growing flesh attached to bone). Using the Art consumes Qi and blood, but it has many miraculous uses.

The Black-Faced Bat King used "bones" as weapons and sprayed blood to regenerate flesh. Combined with his learned martial arts, he could instantly create what seemed like clones. Naturally, it had a miraculous effect, taking people by surprise and forcing Luo Feiyan to a dead end.

Li Xian had a strange thought: "The powerful aspect of this martial art is actually that it can be used for medical purposes!" Using blood to regenerate flesh, for fatal injuries, spitting blood to repair damage.

He then looked at the "Blood Training Three Classics."

A dark brown thin book, with very ancient and crooked fonts... Li Xian took a few glances and immediately felt the writing like wriggling maggots, drilling into his mind from his eye orifices, causing sharp pain.

Li Xian played the "Body Guarding Sound," and the fairy sound echoed in his mind, instantly dispelling the strange sensation. Li Xian cursed inwardly: "The author of this book died full of resentment and unwillingness. This twisted will was infused into the ink. Those with weak minds who read it for a long time will definitely have their minds twisted, becoming manic and irritable."

He had already learned the "Body Guarding Sound," and the fairy sound lingered, protecting his body. His skin felt as if covered by a layer of jade film, making his flesh tougher. Li Xian applied the "Iron Copper Body," "Body Guarding Sound," and "Yang Playing Fairy Sound" simultaneously, making him as hard as red iron, which was extremely powerful.

The later the martial arts, the more the early accumulation is used to piece together transformations. It becomes even more extraordinary. The knowledge and gains of Li Xian, the accumulation of internal Qi and foundation... not a single step is wasted.

His mind settled. The contents of the classic entered his eyes. This was "Lower Class Martial Arts," but it was not a fist and foot stance. There were three classics in total: Blood Transformation, Blood Spitting, and Blood Dissipation.

The Blood Transformation Classic records: "Blood is like a bridge, connecting the Heavenly Palace, linking the Nine Nether." These nine words were not created by the Blood Transformation Classic, but copied from elsewhere.

The Black-Faced Bat King sucked human blood, which went down his intestines and filled his abdominal cavity. But how to turn another person's blood into his own blood was a huge problem.

The Blood Transformation Classic is for this purpose. This technique is very evil; it is a martial art for training the "intestines." It completely abandons the "stomach," and through consuming medicinal baths, transforms the stomach into a "blood sac."

The blood sac is three inches long for minor success, six inches for major success, nine inches for perfection, and twelve inches for peak mastery.

The blood consumed is transported through the blood sac and transformed into new blood for the self. But the efficiency is very low.

Li Xian said: "This classic is evil! If one practices it, one will have to drink blood to survive in the future. It will be difficult to digest other foods."

The classic records: For beasts, a hundred parts of blood transform into one part. For mud, a hundred parts of blood transform into two parts. For essence, a hundred parts of blood transform into ten parts. This shows how low the efficiency is.

The Blood Spitting Classic records the uses of blood quality. How to nurture poisonous blood, how to spit blood to form a cocoon... Although it is related to blood, upon closer inspection, it is not evil. However, it complements the Blood Transformation Classic.

If one does not understand the Blood Transformation Classic, using the Blood Spitting Classic a few times will cause blood depletion, Qi deficiency, and physical weakness, leading to self-destruction. The final "Blood Dissipation Classic" is incomplete, recording how to dissipate blood to preserve oneself when blood overflows.

It also records a move called "Blood Dissipating Great Blood Seal" that uses blood to dissolve muscle and "injure oneself by seven parts to kill the enemy by twelve parts." But this move is incomplete, and the practice method is flawed.

Li Xian's lower class martial arts include: Vast Legs, Green Luo Palm, Gang Thunder Finger, and Seven Star Step. His attainments are deep, but compared to the descendants of great clans and the talented of sects, he cannot be considered much. Moreover, their martial arts inheritances are all systematic, complementing each other, greatly increasing their power.

Li Xian thought: "This martial art is indeed of the evil sect, especially the 'Blood Transformation Classic,' which transforms the stomach into a blood sac.从此饮血而生 (From then on, one lives by drinking blood), and the 'blood sac' fears the sun. Sunlight照射 (shining on it), the blood sac contracts and writhes, and the intestines might even结 (form knots) inside."

"The Blood Spitting Classic, however, can be learned without hindrance. Although I do not know the 'Blood Transformation Classic,' I practice the 'Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian.' When the five organs move turbidity, the body's blood grows. The efficiency is probably not much different from the Blood Transformation Classic."

Thinking of this, Li Xian felt a surge of joy. His internal Qi accumulation had already reached seventy zhang, only two zhang short of the next transformation.

But he had no martial art to practice, so his internal Qi grew slowly. Now that he had obtained the lower class blood classics, if he practiced diligently, the third transformation of the Qi Lake would be within reach.

Li Xian thought: "This Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian actually has such a miraculous effect! It is truly extremely powerful!"

This scripture is the general outline of the Pure Yang Sect's martial arts. Naturally, it is extremely powerful; a single technique trains the five organs simultaneously. If Wen Caishang knew, she would definitely add praise. But it is also extremely difficult:

Strengthen the organs, fortify the bones and blood, initiate creation, generate five colors of light, step on the lotus.

Even the Pure Yang Hermit Lu Dongzhi... only reached "initiate creation." Generating five colors of light, stepping on the lotus... no one has yet been able to comprehend it. The Pure Yang Sect underwent changes precisely because the Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian was too difficult, and entering the sect was not easy, leading to the sect's decline.

Li Xian did not know the key difficulties. He decided to practice the "Blood Spitting Classic," but feared blood deficiency, so he first honed the "Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian."

[You moved the five organs' turbidity, Proficiency +1]

[Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian]

[Proficiency: 489/800 (Entry)]

Li Xian devoted himself to moving the turbidity, nourishing blood and strengthening the body. The organ turbidity was like mischievous children, wandering through the five organs and six viscera, sometimes knocking on the organ doors and entering to play, sometimes circling the organs playfully but not entering.

The method of moving organ turbidity is not strictly following a path to transport the turbidity. Memorizing the path dead leads to very low efficiency. Instead, it summarizes the principles of the upper volume and applies them to the organs.

For example... the five organs and six viscera are like a martial artist's manor, each residing in the east, south, west, and north, being enemies, friends, and confidants of each other. Moving the organ turbidity... is like going out to visit.

Heart turbidity wants to visit Kidney turbidity. From one end of the world to the other, a journey of thousands of miles. Sometimes it can knock open the Kidney door and chat happily with Kidney turbidity. Sometimes, with high spirits, it stays for days and doesn't want to leave. Sometimes, if Kidney turbidity is in a bad mood, it closes the door and doesn't open it.

Sometimes, although Heart turbidity is a gentleman, it also has a temper and leaves in a huff. Heart and Kidney are like this; Liver, Spleen, Stomach... are also like this.

Precisely because it is very difficult to fathom, and there is no fixed number for moving organ turbidity, some people think it depends entirely on luck and mystery, and thus they resent the Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian. The "Meeting" character in the Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian means "intersection."

It also has the meaning of mental understanding.

Therefore, the upper volume records the principles for people to carefully experience. Li Xian grasped the principles of the upper volume, and his efficiency in moving organ turbidity was acceptable. Coupled with "Heaven's Reward for the Diligent," his progress was extremely fast.

Effort yields reward.

He practiced and nurtured himself like this for half a day.

Suddenly, he heard knocking at the vermilion gate.
