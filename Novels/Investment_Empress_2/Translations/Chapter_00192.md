# Chapter 192: Ice Cube vs. 'Ice Cube'?

Everyone had witnessed that breathtaking sword strike from Ying Bing.

After all, the Holy Maiden of the Rain Pavilion was the sixth on the Hidden Dragon List and possessed the Demonic Beauty Constitution; she was by no means weak. In that split-second earlier, if one hadn't been focusing intently, even an Outer Scene expert might have been momentarily confused.

This was the very confidence that had allowed Yin Mianmian to kill several Hidden Dragon prodigies and escape unscathed.

Yet, just now, her Demonic Illusion was shattered by a single sword strike!

Sword Heart Clarity!

The elders privately admitted that within the same realm, they could never achieve Ying Bing's level. Or rather, in their lifetimes, they had never even seen such a person.

Just a moment ago, that young girl had treated the sword mark as a Divine Observation Diagram, comprehending the Ultimate Form, which was already beyond imagination.

And Ying Bing?

The elders exchanged glances, seeing the solemnity and anticipation in each other's eyes. They were about to witness the history of Hengyun Sword City.

"Please," Elder Zeng gestured.

Ying Bing nodded slightly, her deep, quiet eyes turning to look at Li Mo.

If she hadn't exchanged thoughts with him and verified their spirits, she wouldn't have seen that unique moon, nor achieved her current Sword Heart Clarity.

Therefore, if she could gain anything from the Hengyun Sword Mark now, his presence should be part of it.

She lowered her eyes for a moment, then suddenly parted her lips.

"Give me the painting."

"Uh..."

Now it was Li Mo's turn to be mentally conflicted. Being asked this, he was stunned for a moment before taking out the cyan-veined jade slip with the copy of the sword mark.

"Not this one."

"Huh? Then is it..."

Li Mo tentatively took out the painting of the beauty.

Then, he saw Ying Bing take out the big-headed doll from her怀里 and gently place it on the corner of the painting. With a flow of True Essence, the doll's big head was stamped onto it.

The doll was outlined on the beauty painting by the True Essence, very clear.

"This is also from me; you missed it."

"Is this considered a group photo?" Li Mo was speechless yet amused. It looked more like a seal.

The girl turned and walked towards the sword mark. Coincidentally, the aftermath of the clash between the Outer Scene experts had yet to dissipate, and in the light blue sky, a fine rain was falling like threads.

Her blue-flowered dress stood out even more against the rain curtain, making her back view hazy, like looking at flowers through mist. It was hard to tell if she was stepping out of the painting or walking into it.

"The sky is blue, waiting for the mist and rain, while I am waiting for you~"
"The moonlight is scooped up, blurring the ending~"

Li Mo put away the painting and couldn't help but hum softly. To be honest, he sang quite well. If there were any experts from the Fragrant Building who cultivated music, they would probably praise him for having the potential to reach the Dao.

"Brother Li... what you sang... is really... nice..." Princess Jiang Chulong had discovered another one of Brother Li's virtues.

Li Mo smiled. "I'll teach you when we have time."

"But I... I..."

"It's okay. I can teach you hand-by-hand; you'll definitely learn."

"!"

Jiang Chulong's small body trembled. Thanks to her Master's vivid PPT animations, although she still couldn't speak fluently, her imagination was quite rich. She immediately pictured the scene in her mind. But she... she stutters... Can she learn if taught hand-by-hand? If it's Brother Li... then maybe... it should be possible?

***

At that moment.

A strange, indescribable fluctuation emanated from the sword mark, falling upon everyone's ears. Not just the top of the Sword Pavilion, but even the somewhat chaotic martial heroes below could vaguely sense something. It was as if an unknown existence was murmuring in the void, speaking of profound mysteries.

There were不乏 those who desperately tried to listen clearly, hoping to comprehend something from it. But when they listened carefully, they couldn't hear it clearly; instead, it made them feel as if their spirits were on the verge of collapsing.

***

Many gazes, filled with yearning or stupor, converged on the top of the Sword Pavilion. The onlookers felt as if they were right there.

Ying Bing, standing at the center of this fluctuation, saw a completely different scene.

*Hummm—*

A spiritual pattern on her soul glowed faintly. After a clear cry of a bird, moonlight enveloped her.

Ying Bing reached out, intending to touch the sword mark with her soul. It was only then that she realized she was standing in a void.

Opposite her stood another "her." A stranger yet familiar.

No.

Was that the "her" from her past life when she was observing the gods? Or was it a lingering obsession in her heart regarding the Dao of Martial Arts and the Divine Sky Heart Sword?

The "her" was cold and emotionless, her eyes showing no trace of feeling, and she held the Frost Sword in her hand.

Those ice-mirror-like eyes looked over. Though she spoke not a word, it seemed she had said a thousand things.

"Have you forgotten your persistence?"
"Have you forgotten your Martial Dao?"
"Are you... still yourself?"

One question after another followed.

Ying Bing did not intend to answer with words. Instead, she gently raised the Frost Sword in her hand. Words were pale; right and wrong would be answered with the sword.

The "Ying Bing" opposite her moved. The supreme, overbearing sword light that steals the Heavenly Heart with one's own heart suddenly erupted, like divine punishment descending from the heavens, attempting to devour the Ying Bing who had strayed from her original heart.

This was a sword strike from the former Ying Bing against the current Ying Bing!

It was also the truly perfect and flawless *Divine Sky Heart Sword Manual*!

It swept over with a decisive posture!

"That sword..."

Ying Bing closed her eyes. She seemed to see the moon she had seen when their souls merged. That was not just a moon, nor was it merely the Dao of the Moon. There was also a sword within it.

In the blink of an eye, Ying Bing struck.

That divine intent, that clarity, that new understanding of the Dao—all of it was integrated into the original *Divine Sky Heart Sword*, merging into one!

Moonlight shone brilliantly around her. It seemed as if a ethereal moon appeared behind her. She held the sword light, like a fairy descending from the Moon Palace. Her move had not yet arrived, but its artistic conception had already descended.

Flawless and pure.

Seemingly fast, yet seemingly slow.

Calm yet surging, heartless yet full of emotion, the softest yielding the hardest!

This was her answer!

To follow nature's course—is this not also the Heavenly Dao?

*Clang—*

The tips of the two Frost Swords met. It was a contest of intent and a clash of hearts.

It seemed like a long time had passed, yet it was as if only an instant.

Ying Bing opened her eyes. Her eyes reflected the sword mark, and within her clear, quiet gaze, an added touch of mystery and ethereality.

The *Divine Sky Heart Sword* she now possessed was still a divine skill, but it could no longer be called by its former name.

At that moment.

The void trembled. Even after being comprehended, the sword mark continued to vibrate incessantly! This situation was unprecedented!

The elders' faces froze as they rushed forward, fearing some unexpected change.

However, what was destined to happen still happened.

In their horrified eyes, the sword mark that had always existed on the stone as if eternal was rapidly vanishing.

It was as if...

It was being forcibly erased by a higher existence?

Just like the ink on a painting rapidly fading away, turning back into a blank sheet of paper.
