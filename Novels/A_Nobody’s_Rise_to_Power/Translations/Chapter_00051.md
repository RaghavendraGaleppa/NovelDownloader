# Chapter 51: Yang Can Plow

Zhang Yunyi stood up in surprise from behind his desk, asking Peng Jin, "Is that plow really so miraculous?"

Peng Jin nodded repeatedly, excitedly describing the scene of the trial plowing to him.

Upon hearing this, Zhang Yunyi immediately became interested.

Such a divine farming tool would be a monumental contribution!

Especially since the Yu family's foundation is agriculture; this contribution would be even more significant.

If this Manor Lord could claim even a tenth of the credit, wouldn't that count as a death-exemption talisman?

However, this matter has nothing to do with me!

While Zhang Yunyi was lamenting this, Peng Jin said, "Manor Lord, the commoners are going crazy. Spring plowing has just started this year, and making this curved-shank plow isn't difficult. Although our fields can't all use this new plow this year, if we rush the production, we can still use it on a large area of land."

This sentence immediately reminded Zhang Yunyi.

"Hurry, gather all the carpenters and blacksmiths in our manor immediately. Hmm, go recruit from Tianshui City, and borrow craftsmen from other manors..."

Peng Jin said, "Manor Lord, the people in our manor are easy to handle, and spending money to hire people from Tianshui City is also easy. But borrowing people from other manors..."

The six major manors stand on equal footing and have the same status. Borrowing people isn't a matter of issuing orders; it depends on personal favors. However, there is also competition among the six major manors, so it's hard to say whether they would be willing to lend them.

Peng Jin suggested, "Why don't we ask Steward Yang to issue an order? With just one order from him..."

"You fool!" Zhang Yunyi glared. "If he issues the order, how much credit will be left for this Manor Lord? Just go and do it. Once those craftsmen are borrowed, they will learn how to make the new plow. Their manors won't make it in time this year; do they not want to use it next year either?"

Peng Jin suddenly realized and hurriedly agreed, rushing off in a flurry.

The news of the new divine plow spread so quickly it swept through the entire Feng'an Manor like the wind.

In front of Li the Blacksmith's shop, it was already crowded with the manor's commoners. Squeezing at the very front were the free citizens and the household troops. They were there to order the new plow.

The tenant farmers didn't need to buy it, nor could they afford it. They were "hired laborers," and all production materials were provided by the landlord. Of course, they were also exploited the most severely; most of the harvest from a year of hard work belonged to the landlord. What remained was barely enough to survive. Even so, they were overjoyed.

Because the landlord's oxen and plows were limited, and the time allocated to each family was limited, they didn't dare to overuse the landlord's animal power, and they were afraid they wouldn't be able to plow their fields within the time limit, so they had to supplement with manpower. As a result, not only did all the strong laborers in the family have to be tied up in the fields, leaving no time to do other work to supplement their income, but everyone also worked themselves into sickness.

Now, with this divine tool, at least one strong laborer in the family would be freed up. This would make their future lives a bit easier.

"Don't push, don't rush. My master said this plow has to meet the Manor Lord's needs first before it can be your turn," said Li Yue's little apprentice, standing guard at the workshop entrance, looking as imposing as a great general.

"Ah? Then my family won't be able to use it this year?"

"If you can't use it this year, you'll definitely be able to use it next year. Isn't that still having hope?"

Immediately, a tenant farmer in the crowd smiled and consoled him.

Originally, among these manor households, the tenant farmers had the lowest status. But these tenant farmers suddenly discovered that, in some matters, they actually had priority. At least when it came to using the new plow, they were ahead of the free citizens and household troops who had higher status than them.

I am a beast of burden, and I am proud.

Just then, a large team entered Feng'an Manor with great fanfare.

Qing Mei, bringing two stewards, two matrons, and seven or eight large carts, entered Feng'an Manor with over a hundred people. They quickly took over Li's Blacksmith Shop.

"Don't worry. This divine tool, the 'Yang Can Plow,' was researched by Steward Yang of the Yu family's main branch. The young mistress of the main branch has said this is a divine tool that benefits thousands of people. Look..."

The speaker was Zhao Hongyu, the procurement officer of the main branch, with a very loud voice. With one sentence, he named the plow the "Yang Can Plow" and clarified the main branch's credit.

Suo Chanzhi had sent the main branch's procurement officer Zhao Hongyu and the granary steward Ma Sanyuan over. These two were Suo family members brought over from her maiden family, absolutely trusted confidants.

Zhao Hongyu waved his large hand grandly, and the commoners crowding in front of the workshop, rushing to buy the "Yang Can Plow," all turned their heads to look. Seven or eight sets of large carts were parked by the roadside, loaded with various blacksmithing and carpentry tools. Surrounding the carts were mostly the accompanying blacksmiths and carpenters.

Steward Zhao said, "To make the 'Yang Can Plow' as quickly as possible and catch this year's spring plowing, our young mistress has spared no effort! The young mistress has hired many craftsmen, and they have all brought their own tools. At least! At least, our Feng'an Manor will definitely be able to use the 'Yang Can Plow' in time, so everyone can rest assured."

With these words, the free citizens, Yu family household troops, and tenant farmers present were all overjoyed.

The two stewards and two matrons who came this time were all urgently dispatched from the main branch. As for the craftsmen, they were recruited by Suo Chanzhi through her second uncle, Suo Hong.

After the marriage alliance between the two surnames, as one of the conditions for the proposal, the Yu family allowed the Suo family to freely conduct business within the Yu family's territory without being subject to the Yu family's control. Currently, Second Master Suo has already opened some trading posts within the Yu family's territory one after another. Trading is not just about making money; in the process of setting up these posts, the Suo family has gained a foothold, connections, and informants within the Yu family's territory. If not for this, how could the Suo family have been able to recruit so many craftsmen within the Yu family's territory in such a short time?

Suo Chanzhi wanted to firmly pin this great contribution that benefits the entire Yu family, and even the entire world, onto the main line of the main branch of the Yu family. Contributions are often coveted by others. But now, with Suo Chanzhi sending a large number of people in time as the young mistress of the main line, this credit cannot be snatched away by others.

By the time Zhang Yunyi heard the news and hurriedly brought people to Li's Blacksmith Shop, Granary Steward Ma Sanyuan was beaming as he announced:

"The young mistress has instructed that the 'Yang Can Plow' should be quickly promoted to all the Yu family's manors. 'Encouraging Agriculture Steles' should be set up in each manor. The young mistress wants to engrave this agricultural divine tool born from the Yu family on them for generations to admire. The young mistress also instructed that from now on, during the autumn harvest season, the main line of the main branch will provide the funds. For what? To hold 'Harvest Banquets' at each manor to reward all the personnel of the manors."

As soon as these words were spoken, many of the commoners crowded at the front couldn't help but kneel down, offering another round of praise.

At this point, the achievement was complete, and the momentum was established.

Zhang Yunyi stopped in his tracks, his face as dark as the bottom of a pot. Even if he worked harder now, how much credit would be left for him to share?

What made Manor Lord Zhang even more furious was that the young mistress had even sent stonemasons. These stonemasons were quite diligent and carved four "Encouraging Agriculture Steles" the very next day. Then they erected them by the roadsides at the four entrances and exits of Feng'an Manor, east, south, west, and north.

On the "Encouraging Agriculture Steles," there was first the consistent talk of "Agriculture is the foundation, encourage farming and diligence." Then followed a grand account of the invention of the "Yang Can Plow." This was no "Encouraging Agriculture Stele"; it was clearly a monument to achievements. And this achievement was firmly in the hands of the young mistress of the main branch and Steward Yang.

Every year during the autumn harvest season, the main line of the main branch provides the funds to hold the "Harvest Banquet"? That would naturally require the head of the main line of the main branch to come out and host it.

Many manor households have never left a radius of ten miles from their home in their entire lives; how big a sky have they seen? Therefore, Zhang Yunyi, as the lord of the manor, could say whatever he wanted and become the local emperor here. But once the main branch can legitimately use the "Harvest Banquets" to intervene in manor affairs and contact the manor commoners, those unworldly commoners will know that "there are skies beyond the sky." They will then clearly understand that above their manor lord, there is still a presence that can control the manor lord.

They didn't not know about such things before, but they were like farmers living in a remote mountain valley. Those farmers knew there was an emperor and county magistrates in the world, but what did that have to do with them? They would never have any intersection with them; what truly exerted威慑力 on them were the local landlords and tyrants.

Now, Zhang Yunyi's supreme authority was about to be dispersed.

Before Yang Can even did anything specifically against Zhang Yunyi, his foundation was shaken.

The blacksmiths and carpenters sent by the young mistress of the main branch quickly became the main force in forging the "Yang Can Plow." This technology wasn't difficult to master; the difficulty lay in no one ever thinking of it. Once these craftsmen, with the help of Li the Blacksmith and his apprentices, figured out the forging process, the second batch of craftsmen sent by the young mistress arrived.

Thus, Li Yue and his apprentices continued to act as masters, instructing these new craftsmen on how to forge the "Yang Can Plow." Meanwhile, the first batch, who already knew how to make it, had already split off and set out for other manors.

Although it was already impossible to popularize the "Yang Can Plow" on all of the Yu family's land this year, the Yu family's manors, including but not limited to the six major manors under Yang Can's charge, could all witness its advancement, far superior to the straight-shank plow. By the next spring plowing, this new plow would be used on all of the Yu family's land. By then, not only would grain output increase, but the large amount of manpower and animal power saved would also bring earth-shaking changes to the Yu family's domain.

Zhang Yunyi was the "sky" of Feng'an Manor and the "local emperor" of Feng'an Manor. But he found that his "sky" was almost unable to cover this loess land anymore. His prestige as the local emperor was also gradually losing its uniqueness.

This made Manor Lord Zhang feel as if he were sitting on pins and needles, as if a芒刺 were on his back. He felt he had to do something.

Yang Can wasn't targeting him now, just boosting his own reputation. But objectively, Yang Can's actions were shaking his rule over Feng'an Manor. And this action was shaking not just his rule over Feng'an Manor, but what about the other manors?想必 the Lord of the Manor wouldn't want to see the main line of the main branch showing signs of breaking free from his control either, right?

Perhaps this old man can make something out of this point!

Zhang Yunyi stroked his beard, his gaze gradually turning sinister.
