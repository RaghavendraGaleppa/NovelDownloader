Chapter 479: The Great Success of the Profound Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra

As his cultivation technique approached perfection, the profound mysteries of the Cloud Sutra Avatar Art became increasingly apparent. With a mere flicker of thought, the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi could materialize from nothingness at will—forming armor and shields, transforming into cloud ropes, or gathering into offensive weapons. Its endless variations made it impossible to defend against, becoming a hidden killer weapon.

This top-tier refining technique continued to pleasantly surprise him. As his proficiency continuously increased, it could even be said that the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi was not only capable of refining artifacts but could also be used for integrated offense and defense, possessing extremely formidable power.

It could be considered a major trump card.

As for Han Shi in the Divine Martial World, Xu Yunfan was constantly monitoring him through the panel.

Han Shi hid within the mortal realm, scheming to acquire some wealth to purchase a small courtyard in a city. He was greedily cultivating the "Myriad Chariots Transformation Sword Art," and his Sword Embryo was becoming increasingly solid, with the prospect of entering the Sword Embryo realm in sight.

According to the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect's classification of sword cultivator realms, the Sword Embryo realm is equivalent to the Qi Condensation realm.

The spiritual energy in the Divine Martial World is thin and impure, far from being as pure and concentrated as in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World. However, the "Myriad Chariots Transformation Sword Art" cultivated by Han Shi does not rely too much on spiritual energy.

Relying solely on the Sword Embryo, one could be invincible under the heavens.

There was no need to worry too much about his safety; moreover, this avatar was cunning and treacherous. Unless he sought his own death, it would be quite difficult for him to die.

Xu Yunfan watched coldly from the sidelines, not making any moves, but secretly sharing its top-tier comprehension to fathom the Myriad Chariots Transformation Sword Art. His comprehension of the Dao of the Sword, with the assistance of the Attribute Panel, was being unidirectionally extracted without Han Shi's察觉.

As for the various malicious thoughts surging in Han Shi's mind, Xu Yunfan was already fully aware but consistently paid them no heed. As long as the strong binding of the Attribute Panel was in place, even if Han Shi could turn the world upside down, he could not escape Xu Yunfan's palm.

With the aid of the Attribute Panel for cultivation, he naturally understood that the Cloud Sutra Avatar condensed by this "Profane Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra" essentially凝聚s the cultivator's darkest and most twisted negative emotions, transforming them into an independent avatar.

Han Shi's actions in the Divine Martial World almost completely符合 a thorough anti-social personality: selfish, greedy, violent, devoid of moral constraints, and even viewing mortal lives as grass.

When the other party cultivated the "Myriad Chariots Transformation Sword Art," he not only devoured the vitality of living beings to nourish his Sword Embryo but also wantonly slaughtered in mortal cities, using human lives to temper his sword intent. His methods were so cruel that even Xu Yunfan secretly frowned.

However, Xu Yunfan did not interfere.

On one hand, Han Shi's actions did indeed accelerate the nurturing of the Sword Embryo, providing him with purer insights into the Dao of the Sword.

On the other hand, he knew in his heart that the more insane Han Shi became, the more it proved the "pitfall" nature of the Cloud Sutra Avatar Art. The avatar condensed by this cultivation technique is essentially the manifestation of the cultivator's dark side. Without the absolute control of the Attribute Panel, it would likely be such a heartless monster that would eventually counterattack the main body.

Time flowed like water. Years passed silently amidst the circulation of True Wu Power, the comprehension of the Grafting Art, and the repetitive clanging sounds of Cloud Sutra refining.

On this day, a brilliant light circulated within the quiet room.

The last wisp of pure "Kun Earth Cloud Qi" at Xu Yunfan's fingertip converged into his body. Before him, a "Eight Sceneries Cloud Cauldron" refined from dozens of spiritual materials, its form constantly shifting, slowly dissipated into the void.

Almost simultaneously, the realm marker representing the "Profane Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra" in his Sea of Consciousness completely solidified into the dazzling [Great Success]!

'Your Profane Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra has reached Great Success.'

A line of golden text drifted across his vision, slightly relaxing his heart.

Since entering the Dao through martial arts, aside from the Great Success of the True Wu Subduing Devil Sutra, only the Profane Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra had reached Great Success.

Fifteen years of arduous effort had finally reached perfection.

Sensing the massive cultivation experience and images transmitted by the Attribute Panel in his mind, Xu Yunfan's divine sense seemed to be swept into a vast torrent. Countless profound insights about artifact refining flickered in his Sea of Consciousness like stars.

The subtle control of the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi, the method of analyzing the essence of spiritual materials, the perfect integration of runes and Dao rules...

These experiences, which would have originally required hundreds of years of arduous cultivation to accumulate, were now branded into the depths of his soul like a baptism of enlightenment.

What shook his mind the most was the key to refining "Spirit Treasures" within it!

Spirit Treasures, unlike ordinary artifacts or Dharma treasures, are supreme treasures that contain the spiritual charm of heaven and earth and possess their own Dao rules.

After the Great Success of the Profane Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra, the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi could already simulate the essence of all things, transforming the virtual into reality. He "saw" how the cloud qi flowing between his fingertips transformed into the images of the Eight Trigrams, saw how Kun Earth Cloud Qi carried heaviness, Li Fire Cloud Qi burned through illusions, Kan Water Cloud Qi nurtured all things...

The eight types of cloud qi mutually generated and restrained each other. Under the optimal path deduced by the panel, they could perfectly reproduce the chaotic spiritual charm from the beginning of the heavens and earth.

What surprised Xu Yunfan even more was the "nurturing spirit" method for Spirit Treasures.

This was a part of the Profane Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra that had been obscured, but as it reached Great Success, it was forcefully deduced by the Attribute Panel,补全ing the final step of the Profane Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra.

Using one's own Dao Foundation as a furnace and divine powers as fire, placing the artifact in the Purple Mansion to warm and nurture it, gradually allowing it to birth spiritual awareness.

This was almost the work of creation!

Xu Yunfan's heart trembled violently. What kind of artifact refining technique was this?

It was clearly a supreme secret method that pointed directly to the Great Dao!

At this moment, he finally realized that the true value of the "Profane Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra" had never been limited to refining ordinary artifacts.

Whom did this technique originally belong to?

Xu Yunfan was not overjoyed; instead, he frowned deeply.

The fact that Li Baichuan came to provoke him and was killed by him now seemed somewhat abrupt. It was clearly someone fishing, hoping for someone to take the bait.

But now it seemed that the bait on the hook had been eaten by him, and the hook itself had been broken by him.

Xu Yunfan was not too happy about this either.

Those Golden Core True Lords in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World—Xu Yunfan could clearly know just by查阅 the deeds of the True Lords from the Primordial Sect. These people particularly liked to "炸鱼" (stir up trouble to catch newbies) and block the entrance to the newbie village. They didn't give people a chance to grow at all.

Therefore, the two concealment techniques, the Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method and the Turtle Breath Hiding God Art, needed to be cultivated even more. The most important thing was...

With a flicker of thought in Xu Yunfan's mind, a barely perceptible ripple spread from his sleeve.

A simple and profound dark silver bracelet quietly appeared on his wrist.

This ring was forged entirely from a non-metallic, non-jade material called "Nether Star Void Crystal," which flowed with fine star specks. The ring body was as thin as a string, and it was naturally carved with layers upon layers of cloud seal patterns as fine as hair yet secretly conforming to the innate Dao rhythm.

These patterns were not man-made. They were the "Chaotic Star Orbit" naturally formed after the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi, under the ultimate control of the Attribute Panel, underwent forty-nine days of calcination and spiritual refinement.

At the clasp junction, a rice-grain-sized "Obscure Instrument玄钻" was inlaid, constantly devouring the surrounding light.

This object was precisely a Heavenly Mechanism Supreme Treasure that Xu Yunfan, at the Great Success realm of the "Profane Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra," had spent countless rare treasures and, with the assistance of the Attribute Panel's near-omniscient understanding of the origin of all things, had fortunately refined.
