**Chapter 1: Heaven Rewards Diligence**

“Zhen’er… Han Zhen!”

Han Zhen had just opened his eyes, not yet understanding what was happening, when he saw an anxious middle-aged man in ancient satin robes, with a plump, round face and a small goatee, looking at him. The man was vigorously fanning Han Zhen with a fan in one hand, while pinching his philtrum with the other. Seeing Han Zhen open his eyes, the plump man removed his hand and quickly brought a bowl of water to Han Zhen’s lips.

“Thank goodness, Zhen’er, you’re finally awake! If anything had happened, how could I, your Third Uncle, face your father and mother?”

Han Zhen stared blankly at the tree shade above, completely bewildered. Wasn’t he in an examination hall? Had it suddenly turned into a film set in Hengdian? His head began to ache again, as if he was suffering from heatstroke, and the memories of his past life on Earth intertwined with those of this life like a muddy mess. After a long daze, the memories in his mind gradually became clear.

So, he had been reborn!

Fortunately, he had no attachments in his previous life, so Han Zhen quickly accepted his rebirth and the fact that he was now a runner in a restaurant in Green Ox Town. The plump man with the round face who was taking care of him was Han Zhen’s Third Uncle in this life. Han Zhen’s father was the eldest among his Third Uncle’s generation. When Han Zhen was six, his parents went foraging for mountain goods and were eaten by a wild beast. Six-year-old Han Zhen waited for several days at home, only for hunters to bring back a few fragments of his parents’ clothes. After that, Han Zhen lived with his Third Uncle, who had no children yet and was financially comfortable.

Working as a runner in the restaurant was also Han Zhen’s own choice to help out. Originally, Third Uncle had sent Han Zhen to school to learn reading and arithmetic, not expecting him to pass imperial exams and become an official. Even becoming an accountant would have been a great honor, showing that the Han family’s ancestral graves were smoking with good fortune, producing a cultured person. There was even a chance he could become an outer disciple of the Seven Mysteries Sect, just like Third Uncle himself. However, Han Zhen wasn't suited for academics, so Third Uncle used his connections to obtain an external martial art manual for Han Zhen and paid a master to guide him in. For the past few years, he had been trying to find people to recommend Han Zhen for the Seven Mysteries Sect’s inner disciple assessment.

Unexpectedly, Third Uncle recently managed to become an outer disciple of the Seven Mysteries Sect himself, which allowed him to recommend children between 7 and 12 years old to participate in the inner disciple trial. Han Zhen didn’t want to disappoint Third Uncle again, so for three years, he had trained diligently every day. As the date of the trial approached, Han Zhen wanted to make further progress, which led him to train until exhaustion and heatstroke in the scorching heat, accidentally awakening his memories from his previous life.

Green Ox Town… Seven Mysteries Sect trial… Third Uncle Han!

Han Zhen suddenly thought of something, his eyes wide, and he abruptly sat up.

“You… you’re really my Third Uncle, aren’t you?”

“Are you training so hard you’ve gone silly, kid?!” Third Uncle retorted, flicking Han Zhen’s forehead.

“It’s good that you’re fine. Take it easy these next few days. It doesn’t matter if you don’t pass the inner disciple trial. I can’t let your father’s lineage end on my watch. If something really happened to you, I wouldn’t have the face to meet your father in the afterlife.” Third Uncle’s flick on Han Zhen’s forehead wasn’t forceful. Afterwards, he gently pressed the Shen Ting acupoint on Han Zhen’s head.

Han Zhen recalled memories from several years ago. His Second Uncle’s family indeed had a fourth child, named Han Li, whom the villagers called “Er Lengzi” (Simpleton Han). This was undoubtedly the future Venerable Han Li! The last time he saw Han Li was when he was six years old; he was thin and dark, very unremarkable, but his eyes held a liveliness that contradicted his nickname “Er Lengzi”.

***

Three days later, outside the Spring Fragrance Restaurant in Green Ox Town.

Fatty Han had kept a close eye on Han Zhen for the past few days, making him rest properly. Before leaving, he gave a few more instructions, then climbed into his carriage and sped off from east to west. Han Zhen waved, watching the carriage kick up dust as it disappeared into the distance. His interactions over these past few days had helped him adapt to his identity in this world; the memories of living together for several years allowed Han Zhen to quickly accept this familial affection. Third Uncle’s kindness towards him was genuine, and Third Aunt also liked him very much. As for why Third Uncle had no children, perhaps there was some unspoken difficulty; Han Zhen was just a child and didn't dare ask too much. If he had the chance to embark on the path of cultivation in the future, these issues could easily be resolved. This would be his greatest repayment to Third Uncle.

While Han Zhen pondered, the carriage was no longer in sight. Third Uncle’s round trip, at the carriage’s speed, would likely take seven days. Third Uncle had thought that his Second Brother’s fourth child was also within the age range for the assessment. He figured that since he was recommending one, he might as well recommend both. If both of his nephews became disciples of the Seven Mysteries Sect, they could look out for each other. Fatty Han had noticed the child Han Li’s yearning for the outside world every time he visited his Second Brother’s house, and he was very fond of the boy.

After the busy lunch rush, Han Zhen found some free time and went to the backyard. For the past few days, Third Uncle had been watching him closely, giving Han Zhen no chance to secretly practice his martial arts. Only after confirming that Han Zhen was truly well did he feel relieved enough to leave Green Ox Town and persuade his Second Brother to let Han Li try the Seven Mysteries Sect’s trial.

In the backyard, there were two wooden dummies, one large and one small. In the three years Han Zhen had practiced martial arts, his height and strength had grown considerably. He could effortlessly lift two hundred-jin stone locks simultaneously, one in each hand. Stroking the marks left by his strikes on the wooden dummy, Han Zhen had a clear idea of his future in this life: seize every opportunity to embark on the path of cultivation. The two easiest ways Han Zhen currently knew to obtain cultivation methods were, firstly, to join the Seven Mysteries Sect and obtain the Evergreen Arts from Han Li, who would be taken as a disciple by Doctor Mo.

If he couldn't cultivate, the other option would be to wait until Han Li went to Tainan Valley to find Five Element cultivation methods and then try them one by one. To cultivators, mortals were like ants. To try his luck outside Tainan Valley was too slim a hope, let alone trying to find a sect. As for cultivation families linked by blood, that was even less of an option; Han Zhen feared becoming an expendable resource. Moreover, his current body was that of a child not yet twelve years old. Even a trip to Han Li’s mountain village took three days; searching for immortals thousands of miles away was pure folly.

Finally, if he truly had no spiritual roots… then he could only train diligently in martial arts, help Doctor Mo a little when he made his move on Han Li, and perhaps assist in taking care of Doctor Mo’s family, settling down as a wealthy man, making Han Li remember him as a good elder brother, and hoping Han Li would lend him a hand in his next life.

Therefore, Han Zhen absolutely had to succeed in the Seven Mysteries Sect’s inner disciple trial!

The external martial art Han Zhen practiced was called "Tiger Roar Fist." It had cost Fatty Han a significant amount of silver to obtain a copy from an inner disciple. When this skill was mastered, its punches would be accompanied by a tiger's roar, intimidating the heart and soul.

After completing a set of Tiger Roar Fist, Han Zhen wiped away his sweat. Suddenly, he saw a red light before his eyes. Han Zhen thought he was suffering from heatstroke again and was seeing hallucinations. He soaked a towel in cool water and placed it on his forehead, but the hallucination only became clearer.

A beautiful red scroll, inscribed with "Heaven Rewards Diligence," appeared directly in Han Zhen’s mind, containing the unfathomable power of the Heavenly Dao. Han Zhen was stunned, then an uncontrollable look of wild joy spread across his face. Having played many cultivation games in his past life, he naturally knew about innate qi luck. And a red attribute was the rarest qi luck. It was a divine-grade qi luck, superior to saint-grade and immortal-grade!

As Han Zhen observed and thought, the "Heaven Rewards Diligence" qi luck attribute directly merged into his soul. The red scroll shone brilliantly—

**[Qi Luck: Heaven Rewards Diligence]**
**[Attribute: Every effort yields a reward.]**

A clear stream flowed into his body, and the bottleneck that had stumped him for three years naturally broke through. When Han Zhen swung his fists again, they whistled, and his movements were agile, like a tiger pouncing on its prey.

Tiger Roar Fist: Minor Accomplishment!
