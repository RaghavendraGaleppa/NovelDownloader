Chapter 564: A Discussion

"This is almost a clear instruction for Xu Yunfan to 'run if things go wrong'." After all, losing a genius in the Way of Formations would be a true pity.

Tianyan Zhenren did not refute this, tacitly agreeing with Lu Chuan's suggestion.

After all, losing a potential disciple like Xu Yunfan would be a huge loss for any faction. Masters of the Way of Formations are rare even among the Three Sects.

Xu Yunfan said, "Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother. I will remember it in my heart!"

"Good."

Tianyan Zhenren made the decision. "There is no time to lose. With Xue He's death, the secret key and spatial coordinates for opening the passage have been transferred to me. Three days from now, you will lead the troops and serve as the vanguard for the Primordial Origin Sect's campaign against the Heavenly Realm!"

Xu Yunfan said solemnly, "I obey the Sect Master's command!"

Watching Tianyan Zhenren's figure slowly disappear into the depths of the sea of clouds, Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath, the heaviness in his heart easing slightly.

Tianyan Zhenren harbored ill intentions. If Lu Chuan hadn't been standing to the side, forcing him to restrain himself, Xu Yunfan probably wouldn't have been let off so easily.

It's true that having a powerful backer makes things easier!

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly. As expected, you have to pick a side no matter where you are. If you pick the right one, you'll have someone to support you.

Although Qingyuan Zhenjun had an indifferent personality, he was quite protective of his own.

He had to be. In the Primordial Origin Sect, if you aren't protective of your own, your disciples might defect to another faction at the next moment.

Xu Yunfan retracted his gaze and turned to Lu Chuan, who was also standing in mid-air. He saw that although his direct superior looked composed, there was a barely perceptible smile in his eyes.

It seems he was waiting for me.

Xu Yunfan quickly adjusted his posture and said with a smile, cupping his hands, "Senior Brother Lu Chuan, although the summit of the Divine Thunder Peak has suffered a calamity from the old devil Xue, the elegant courtyard on the peak still stands. From there, one can overlook the sea of clouds and observe the world in peace. If you don't mind, why don't you come down with me for a seat? We can enjoy a cup of clear tea and discuss the matters that were left unresolved?"

His tone was earnest. After all, with Tianyan Zhenren present earlier, both sides had spoken with hidden meanings. Now that only fellow sect members remained, they might be able to speak more deeply.

Lu Chuan's eyes flashed, a hint of a smile appearing between his sharp eyebrows. He had been waiting for these words for a long time.

He lightly brushed his sleeve, the hem of his robe fluttering in the wind, and said loudly, "Junior Brother's words are exactly what I was thinking. I was just hoping to see the dwelling of a formation prodigy like you, to see what kind of place it is where you usually go into seclusion."

With that, he didn't wait for Xu Yunfan to lead the way. His blue robe unfurled, and he shot like a meteor toward the elegant courtyard complex built into the mountainside at the summit of the Divine Thunder Peak.

Xu Yunfan hurriedly followed, feeling slightly relieved.

Since Lu Chuan was so enthusiastic, he would naturally be able to gain even more benefits.

Setting aside the art of artifact refining, just by relying on his mastery of formations, even a Foundation Establishment perfection expert like Lu Chuan would have to greet him with cupped hands.

The Divine Thunder Peak was Xu Yunfan's cave dwelling, which he had managed for many years. Although the area below the peak was a mess of rubble from the previous battle, the summit, protected by the formation, was naturally unscathed.

The elegant courtyard was situated on a cliff, its walls built of green jade, with exotic flowers and rare grasses dotted throughout, complementing the sea of clouds outside the peak.

As the two entered the courtyard, they saw a winding stone path. In the center was a small, suspended pavilion with a low-hanging thatched roof. Inside the pavilion was a red sandalwood low table and two meditation cushions, directly facing the endless sea of clouds to the east.

The clouds churned, sometimes like spilled ink, sometimes shimmering with gold and purple. At the far end of the horizon, a faint light seemed to fluctuate, as if connecting to the vast spiritual energy of the Taihua Spirit Ruin Realm.

The wind rose and clouds surged here, and the atmosphere was unpredictable. It was an excellent place for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to contemplate the heavens and the earth.

Xu Yunfan often came here for enlightenment.

Lu Chuan walked straight into the pavilion and took a seat. Xu Yunfan did not neglect this either. With a light wave of his sleeve, he took out a jade pot and jade cups from his storage bag. The fragrance of tea wafted through the air—it was actually prepared spiritual tea, with steam rising and spiritual energy misting around it.

Facing the sea of clouds, Xu Yunfan first poured tea for Lu Chuan.

Lu Chuan, however, was not in a hurry to drink. He carefully observed the marvelous scenery of the sea of clouds for a moment, then suddenly let out a sigh filled with admiration and surprise.

"Junior Brother! Today's battle has truly opened this Senior Brother's eyes. I originally thought that your skill in artifact refining had already reached a high level, making you a outstanding figure among mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. I never expected that your talent in the Way of Formations would be so extraordinary. It's truly surprising!"

Before Xu Yunfan could speak, Lu Chuan's tone shifted.

"That old devil Xue was no ordinary foe; even I had to be cautious against him. He was a veteran late-stage Foundation Establishment devil with a deep and solid foundation. Ordinary methods couldn't get close to him. It's a pity that his mind was clouded by the Five Turbidities, and he fell into a trap set by someone."

At this point, Lu Chuan shook his head slightly. "The True Scripture of the Demonic Path can indeed save a lot of effort, but in the end, the heart and soul are the weakest. It's easy to trigger a killing calamity and be used by others. What a pity..."

Xu Yunfan understood. So that was it. No wonder the Primordial Origin Sect was called the Primordial Demon Sect, yet most of the cultivation methods practiced within were grand and orthodox paths. Even the Hundred Desires Peak, although it practiced dual cultivation techniques, could still be considered orthodox.

What about those who were drained dry? They're just "materials." Can materials be considered people?

At this moment, Lu Chuan continued, "I didn't expect you to be able to set up a great array on the Divine Thunder Peak, using the terrain to draw upon celestial phenomena, shifting yin and yang to generate thunder, and refining him to death. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would have found it hard to believe that such mastery of formations came from you. To be able to perceive the heavenly and earthly qi in such a short time, grasp the earth veins, understand the nodes, and deploy a counter-formation in an instant—this isn't just the result of bitter cultivation. It's truly an innate gift, something that cannot be forced by human effort!"

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan knew it was a sincere compliment from Lu Chuan, but he also caught the underlying meaning.

Qingyuan Zhenjun's faction wanted to win him over.

His position had naturally been raised a little.

No wonder Lu Chuan was so polite and showed no arrogance at all.

He took a light breath, suppressing a hint of pride in his heart, and gave a modest and gentle smile. He bowed and refilled Lu Chuan's tea.

"Senior Brother, you flatter me. I was just lucky. In my early years, I received guidance from my master and studied a few volumes of incomplete formation texts. I only gained a slight insight through tempering. How can I be called a talent? The Way of Formations is vast and profound; I have only just glimpsed the threshold. When it comes to deduction and deployment, I am still far from adequate. It is Senior Brother who, as a great expert at the perfection of Foundation Establishment, possesses a profound True Scripture and has hope for the Golden Core path, who is truly a role model for us."

His voice was sincere, without a trace of pretense.

This was not false modesty. Xu Yunfan was well aware of this. The Way of Formations emphasizes heavenly secrets. It requires observing the changes of yin and yang and sensing the nodes of spiritual energy in an extremely short time. A slight miscalculation would lead to total failure. If not for his attribute panel, he would have been completely unable to do it.

Although he won today's battle, if not for the old devil Xue's chaotic state of mind revealing a flaw, even if he had won in the end, it would have been a pyrrhic victory. At that time, other Primordial Origin experts would likely have made a move to profit from it.

However, Xu Yunfan still had many trump cards he hadn't used. Just his innate divine ability, the Battle Formula, and the almost-completed Presence Formula. Once he activated his secret techniques, his overall strength would increase several times over.

Lu Chuan laughed heartily, picked up his teacup and took a small sip. He praised the tea as excellent before continuing.

"Junior Brother, you don't need to be modest. In the Primordial Origin Sect, masters of the Way of Formations are few and far between. Now that you have shown your brilliance, you will naturally have to bear important responsibilities."

He paused here, his expression turning serious.
