Chapter 169: The Mountain

Niu Hong saw he couldn't refuse, so he accepted and put it away.

The group entered the VIP room. Everyone present was speechless, because what they saw next was the two parties conversing cheerfully, feeling like old friends who had met too late. Their conversation was lively and enthusiastic, with no trace of the earlier tension. The VIP room in the banquet hall was actually a cave-mansion, open-plan. From the outside, one could see beautiful peaks rising one after another, shrouded in spiritual energy, with clouds steaming and mists glowing. There were also pavilions, golden waterfalls, silver springs, and other incredibly magnificent sights. All these beautiful sceneries were contained within a single room, truly extraordinary. It was a realm unto itself, possessing its own creation, beyond the imagination of ordinary people. This was merely one floor; many rooms were unique and independent cave-mansions.

"Brother Saint Demon, where did you go to enjoy yourself a few days ago?" Zhang Yu spoke at the right moment, raising his wine cup. The wine in the cup was his own, shimmering slightly, as lustrous and translucent as honey.

"I returned to the Nine Provinces to handle some matters," Saint Demon said calmly, without much concealment.

"Since you've returned to the Star Realm, I presume the matters have been dealt with?"

"More or less." Saint Demon gave a vague answer.

"Oh." Zhang Yu's eyes flickered, seemingly pondering something.

Zhou Tian, Zhang Kun, and Niu Hong sat together. Zhang Kun raised his cup, gesturing an apology to Zhou Tian for the recent incident.

"Brother Zhang was merely misled by a villain; there's no need for apologies." Zhou Tian also knew how to speak politely.

"Haha, Brother Mu is truly a young talent, and his thoughts are indeed clear. He must be of noble birth." Zhang Kun looked at Zhou Tian's face, covered in a full beard with bizarre features, and said sincerely.

"Oh, no, no, Brother Zhang is the true young prodigy, ultimately standing on the side of justice." Zhou Tian was also very good at flattery.

Niu Hong's expression was strange; he didn't know what to say, so he just kept drinking. In the end, the two almost embraced, ready to become sworn brothers, and even tried to pull Niu Hong in. If Niu Hong hadn't strongly declined, they might have assigned themselves as elder and third brothers on the spot.

Before long, and it was unknown what Saint Demon and Zhang Kun discussed, their reunion concluded.

"Brother Zhang, next time we meet, we must have a drunken night." Zhou Tian said, cupping his fist.

Zhang Kun glanced at the untouched wine in Zhou Tian's cup and also laughed, "Absolutely, absolutely."

After seeing off Saint Demon, Zhou Tian, and the three, Zhang Yu stood silently for a long time, his eyes opening and closing, seemingly reflecting an endless starry sky.

"What's the background of that Mu Su?" He spoke, his expression calm, devoid of the smile he had moments ago.

"Reporting, Grandfather, this person adapts his speech to his audience, and his lips are sealed; nothing can be extracted from him." Behind him, Zhang Kun replied.

"At this critical juncture, what is Saint Demon doing here?" Zhang Yu murmured to himself. A moment later, he added, "Stay away from such people. He's just a collateral branch disciple; why bother with him?"

"Yes, Grandfather." Zhang Kun gave a wry smile. In reality, the invitation wasn't sent to that 'Mr. Chen' at all, but to the Chen family. However, he didn't know why it ended up in his hands. But there was no need to say any of this.

Meanwhile, this matter spread through those present. Photos of Saint Demon and Mu Su instantly reached intelligence-selling organizations, and were subsequently bought by interested parties. Saint Demon was also a highly noticed individual in the Star Realm, because when Heavenly Venerates did not appear, Dao Lords were the strongest combatants. Saint Demon's state was also very strange, almost a step away from becoming a Dao Lord, so many people paid attention to him. Furthermore, Saint Demon was from the Nine Provinces and had an ambiguous relationship with Luotian Temple. His presence here at such a turbulent time elevated his level of attention even further.

Meanwhile, Zhou Tian, Phoenix, and Saint Demon returned to their room. As soon as the door closed, Saint Demon said coldly, "Don't go out for the next few days. How much time has passed, and you've already managed to provoke a Heavenly King? If I let you out, I'm afraid that after a while, the entire Tongtian Company will be hunting us down!"

"Am I that formidable?" Zhou Tian muttered softly.

"And you! I told you to watch him, not to fool around with him!" Saint Demon reprimanded Phoenix. Phoenix slightly lowered her head, not saying a word.

Zhou Tian immediately grew anxious. He thought, "Scold me all you want, but why are you scolding Miss Phoenix?" He instantly became displeased and said huffily, "Exactly! I told you to watch me, not to fool around with me! It's all your fault, don't follow me anymore!"

Saint Demon and Phoenix both looked at Zhou Tian. Phoenix glared fiercely at him with her beautiful large eyes.

"See, see, she's glaring at me again! I'm hurt! I can only get better if I see a short skirt! Quickly, make her transform into a short skirt and put it on!" Zhou Tian said to Saint Demon, clutching his chest.

"Alright, stop messing around. This place is a den of mixed powerful and dangerous individuals. Don't let my seemingly pleasant conversation with Zhang Yu fool you; he might already have people watching us," Saint Demon said with a frown.

"How much longer until that Heavenly Venerate Tomb opens?" Zhou Tian asked.

"About three or four days."

"Alright then, considering you just stood up for your 'big brother,' I won't go out for the next few days," Zhou Tian said. This place was indeed a mixed bag of powerful and dangerous individuals. Just that small banquet had several influential forces in the Star Realm, even with Heavenly Kings present. If he were to go out courting death and something unusual were discovered, attracting some old Heavenly Venerate monster, then "trouble" wouldn't even begin to describe it.

"I am a retainer of your Zhou family, so naturally I must protect you," Saint Demon said calmly, without batting an eye.

"Damn it, why didn't you think of yourself as a retainer of my Zhou family when you threatened me back then?" Zhou Tian said, glaring.

"If you weren't willing to help me, then I'd have no choice but to do that. If my current state continues, it's no different from a Heavenly Venerate taking action against me, so I have no fear. But since you are willing to help me, then I am a retainer of your Zhou family, and naturally, I will do my best to protect you," Saint Demon said with a smile on his face.

"Your rogue's logic truly is..." Zhou Tian was dumbfounded, unsure how to comment, so he simply ignored him.

Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, three days flew by. Saint Demon took Zhou Tian from the Tongtian Hotel and traveled through a teleportation plaza to an extremely remote spatial node, already beyond node 5000. Then, using a one-time exotic treasure, they directly opened a spatial channel, bypassing any man-made spatial passages, thus reducing the possibility of being discovered.

This was a void. In the distance, brilliant star points shimmered. What was astonishing was an incomparably colossal divine mountain standing majestically in the void, its height unknown. It exuded a hazy glow, and an ancient, enduring aura flowed around it, as if it had existed for countless eons, practically standing within time itself.
