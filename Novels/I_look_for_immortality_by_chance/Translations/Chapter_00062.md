# Chapter 62: Golden-Backed Ape, Bribery Negotiations  

*Clang!*  

Without turning around, Gu Yuan had already summoned the Mystic Turtle Seal to his back. The deep, patterned shell with its strange luster blocked the attack from behind.  

The sound of metal striking metal rang out abruptly, accompanied by terrifying force. Even the Mystic Turtle Seal, enhanced by the Minor Titan Seal, struggled to withstand the blow. The shell trembled violently, as if on the verge of cracking.  

The dimmed seal wobbled before falling back into Gu Yuan’s dantian, too weakened to continue the fight and in need of recuperation.  

*Roar!*  

The deafening roar did not cease. Another surge of terrifying force, carrying a foul gust of wind, came crashing down toward him.  

*Boom!*  

But above Gu Yuan’s head, an earthen-yellow seal had appeared at some point, casting down illusory mountain shadows that enveloped him completely.  

The violent force collided with the mountain illusions, producing a thunderous impact as shockwaves rippled outward.  

However, the Mountain Seal was a top-tier defensive artifact with formidable power. Though the mountain illusions rippled like water, they held firm against the attack.  

Meanwhile, the assailant was forced back two steps, panting heavily.  

Seizing the moment, Gu Yuan turned and finally got a clear look at his attacker.  

It was a massive ape, strikingly similar to the silver-backed apes he had encountered earlier, but even taller and more muscular, its body seemingly forged from steel. Along its back, faint golden streaks shimmered amidst its fur.  

Currently, it was gripping a silver stone staff, glaring at Gu Yuan with hostility.  

*Golden-backed ape. So, there really is an organized force behind these spirit apes.*  

Gu Yuan wasn’t surprised.  

In this waterfall cavern, the brown-furred apes were clearly the miners, while the silver-backed apes served as guards and enforcers. Naturally, there had to be a stronger leadership behind them.  

Gu Yuan had originally planned to take advantage of their absence, play the thief, grab the spirit stones, and leave.  

But now, he had been cornered inside the cave.  

*Hoo hoo!*  

At that moment, two more golden-backed apes leaped in from behind the waterfall, followed by several silver-backed apes.  

However, these apes weren’t carrying weapons. Instead, they held jars of fine wine and spirit fruits. The wine jars were unsealed, releasing an intoxicating aroma that filled the air.  

But upon spotting Gu Yuan, the apes immediately set down their offerings and hastily grabbed whatever weapons they could, fixing him with hostile glares.  

*Golden-backed apes—one of the most intelligent spirit beasts of Linghe Island. Lower-grade spirit apes have brown fur and strength equivalent to the third layer of Qi Refinement. Mid-grade apes, with silver backs and iron-like arms, reach around the sixth layer. Once silver fur gives way to golden streaks, they become golden-backed apes, starting at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement. The more golden their fur, the stronger they are.*  

Recalling the records from Linghe Island, Gu Yuan pieced together the situation.  

*These apes live in groups and brew monkey wine—an exquisite liquor that can intoxicate even cultivators and offers significant benefits to Qi Refinement practitioners. It’s one of Linghe Island’s main products.*  

The scene before him aligned perfectly with the records.  

He quickly deduced the truth.  

The golden-backed ape clan must have stumbled upon this small spirit vein by accident. Fearing discovery by the island’s cultivators, they had assigned a small group to mine it secretly while the rest continued producing monkey wine as a cover.  

After all, the daily patrols on Linghe Island consisted mostly of sixth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators, few in number. Given the island’s vastness, staying undetected was easy—if they were careful.  

But they hadn’t accounted for Gu Yuan stumbling upon their operation.  

Fortunately for them, the jungle was their domain. Their scouts had quickly alerted the clan, summoning a seventh-layer golden-backed ape to deal with the intruder.  

Now, three golden-backed apes—each at the seventh layer—along with several sixth-layer silver-backed apes, stood before Gu Yuan.  

Yet, he remained unfazed, merely watching them coldly.  

For a moment, the cavern was thick with tension.  

*Hoo hoo hoo!*  

The lead golden-backed ape glared at Gu Yuan, then pointed at the wine and spirit fruits on the ground before gesturing wildly toward the waterfall exit.  

Finally, it jabbed a finger at Gu Yuan’s lips.  

*"Are you telling me to take the monkey wine and spirit fruits, leave, and keep quiet about this?"* Gu Yuan asked hesitantly.  

*Ook ook!*  

The golden-backed ape nodded rapidly.  

For spirit beasts, achieving human form and speech was no easy feat. The stronger the bloodline, the harder it was to transform.  

Moreover, many beasts had no desire to take human form or wear human garments, preferring to live in their natural state.  

But the inability to speak didn’t mean they lacked intelligence. Though this golden-backed ape hadn’t refined its throat bone to speak, its mind was as sharp as any human’s.  

Right now, it was negotiating.  

Yet Gu Yuan shook his head.  

*"You are merely spirit beasts raised by the Dao Academy, living safely under its protection to grow your clan. Instead of repaying this kindness, you secretly mine spirit stones—a grave crime!"*  

*"As an inner disciple of the academy, how can I stand by and allow such banditry?"*  

*"If you know what’s good for you, leave at once. I will gather the spirit stones and hand them over to the academy!"*  

His voice dripped with righteous indignation.  

The golden-backed ape rolled its eyes in exasperation.  

*Squeak squeak!*  

It gestured to the lower-grade spirit apes behind Gu Yuan, who pushed forward about a hundred spirit stones from the pile before pointing at Gu Yuan again.  

*"Hah! You think you can bribe a Dao Academy disciple? Scram!"*  

Gu Yuan remained unmoved.  

The golden-backed ape’s eye twitched in anger, clearly on the verge of attacking. But then its ears flicked, as if hearing something, and it suppressed its fury.  

With another command, the lower-grade apes pushed forward another hundred or so spirit stones.  

Now, over two hundred spirit stones lay piled together, emitting a faint glow in the cavern.  

Still, Gu Yuan shook his head.  

*"This mine belongs to the academy. I won’t let beasts defile it!"*  

*Roar!!*  

At this, the golden-backed ape could no longer restrain itself. Gripping its stone staff, it charged at Gu Yuan.  

The other golden-backed and silver-backed apes followed suit, unleashing a surge of demonic energy that filled the cavern.  

Yet Gu Yuan remained calm, exhaling softly.  

*Whoosh!*  

In an instant, dense fog and torrential rain flooded the cavern, as if the waterfall outside had surged inward. Thick mist obscured everything.  

Gu Yuan had made his move.  

When two thieves meet, how could treasure be divided with mere words?  

Only after testing each other’s strength could the spoils be decided.  

Having recently broken through, Gu Yuan’s power had soared. He wouldn’t settle for a mere two hundred spirit stones—not without a fight.  

*Roar!!*  

The golden-backed ape, equally fierce, abandoned negotiation for violence. The golden streaks along its back shimmered as if liquid power flowed through them, amplifying its strength.  

But the all-encompassing fog and relentless rain quickly suppressed it.
