Chapter 198: Such a Young Man

Qin Ming stood with his left hand behind his back, as serene as an abyss, determined to display his true Ancestral Master-level foundation!

After landing, Ling Yu still stumbled back several steps. With each footfall, a clear cracking sound echoed as the lapis lazuli ground, as hard as iron, began to fracture.

Tang Jun stared blankly. Ling Yu was recently the headline figure in the Night Report, a Young Ancestor destined to test his sword against all under heaven, yet he was sent flying so far back by a single palm.

Cheng Rui's face stiffened. This was Ling Yu, even more formidable than her childhood sweetheart, and this time he hadn't been "ambushed." Yet, he was knocked flying the moment he approached.

Qian Chuan desperately wanted to say: No one understands the truth better than me.

As someone of similar standing, Xin Youdao deeply understood the power behind that palm. This was a direct, head-on overwhelming of an opponent, a display of dominant strength!

"Gak..." Master Wu, who had been speaking, abruptly fell silent.

Tang Jin had once taught Ling Yu that even if the Flying Immortal Mountain in the depths of the night mist collapsed before his eyes, he should remain unfazed. But at this moment, even she herself couldn't do it.

"Such a young man... we'll protect him!" One of the two elders actually trembled, and the sparse hairs on his head fluttered.

"Minghui, that child cultivating in the Immortal Land hasn't found a partner yet, has he?" The other elder secretly transmitted his voice.

Zhao Minghui was instantly stunned. The old man was a highly esteemed elder in her family, and he was already thinking about this after just seeing one palm strike?!

Of course, she was also shocked. Who was Ling Yu? Hailed as a Young Ancestor, his presence only further highlighted the unfathomable depth of the other person.

Ling Yu was dazed, incredulous. He looked down at his hands. Was this still him? Could he no longer unleash his invincible fist prints?

The next moment, he charged forward again, faster than before. Heavenly Light surged around his body like a burning galaxy, accompanied by wondrous phenomena, as he blasted towards the young man in the arena.

If this scene had occurred on any other day, everyone would have exclaimed in admiration and offered heartfelt praise, but now, they could only remain silent.

Because the other person was even more outrageous!

Qin Ming stood rooted to the spot, his green robes flapping loudly in the Heavenly Light energy generated by his opponent. He simply pushed out another palm.

Bang!

Ling Yu flew backward, a trace of blood appearing at the corner of his mouth.

He was very proud and refused to use power from the Outer Saint level.

Afterward, he attacked again, this time from mid-air, swooping down, quite sacred and pristine, like a lone, bright moon disk in the clear sky.

However, he seemed unable to escape a certain fate. He was still pushed away by a single palm from the young man standing motionless in the center of the arena, his clothes ragged, his mouth full of bloody foam.

No one spoke. This was truly difficult to comment on.

Was Ling Yu not strong enough? Of course not. He had once been the focus of attention, recognized by all sides, and could be called a prodigy.

One could only say that the other young man was even more monstrous, beyond common understanding!

"Three palms... three thousand gold coins." In this situation, even Little Wu didn't dare speak loudly, counting in a voice as faint as an insect's chirp.

Tang Jin wanted to call a stop, but Ling Yu in the arena showed no sign of backing down.

This time, he activated his Consciousness Spiritual Light.

Earlier, he knew Qin Ming cultivated the New Life Path, so he had only used techniques from that path, intending to compete and defeat the young man from Black and White Mountain in the opponent's most proficient domain.

Now, it seemed he had overthought things. The gap between them on the New Life Path was... considerable!

If he was a Young Ancestor, then the other person was—an Ancestral Master!

Unfortunately, even when Ling Yu used the techniques of an 'outsider', he still couldn't change the situation, and this time he flew even further back.

Qin Ming's palm force seemed to grow stronger with resistance!

His robes fluttered, and his right hand glowed, dazzlingly bright. That was a force of extreme Yang and unyielding might, capable of burning Consciousness Spiritual Light, seemingly igniting it while blasting the opponent away.

Ling Yu was too proud. Even though he couldn't block it, he still didn't use the power of the Second Realm, Yellow Court.

He attacked a fifth time, his Heavenly Light energy mixed with a wisp of Pure Yang Spiritual Light, blasting forward.

Alas, he was destined to lose this battle. In an instant, he coughed up a mouthful of blood, falling to the ground, staggering, his face extremely pale, barely able to stand.

Those present should have applauded in praise; Qin Ming's performance was truly too astounding. But if they did so, it would be too cruel to the other person.

The young man standing motionless in the arena, whose feet hadn't moved an inch from beginning to end, fighting with only one hand—what level of monster was he?

Everyone's eyes held a strange look. After careful consideration, this... this must be true Ancestral Master-level talent!

"Five palms... five thousand gold coins, perfectly completed." Little Wu was quite considerate, whispering so as not to provoke the main subject.

The nearby spectators were speechless upon hearing this.

Especially Tang Jin, who glared fiercely at him.

Qin Ming looked across, saying, "As I said, you can use your full power, unleash the strength of the Second Realm, and truly let me fight unreservedly."

Ling Yu pursed his lips, silent. He clenched his fists, knuckles turning white. He was unwilling. As a young man, and one who had been high-spirited recently, who wouldn't aspire to dominate the world?

However, at this moment, he had suffered a crushing defeat in the same realm, as if facing a towering mountain that he simply could not cross.

He didn't even know how high this mountain truly was!

This was an experience he had never had before, and his mind was trembling.

"Call him back," the Purple-Eyed Crow said, "because if this continues, it won't be a matter of resolving a mental block anymore."

"Come back," Tang Jin said.

She naturally realized that if the fight continued, Ling Yu might very well... form an unbreakable knot in his heart.

"Actually, you don't need to take it to heart," Qin Ming began, "on this path, victory and defeat are both normal. No one dares to claim they can overwhelm all opponents."

Was he comforting his opponent? The two elders nodded, their faces showing relieved smiles.

However, the young people present all thought his self-deprecating words lacked "sincerity," because he was demonstrating what "overwhelming" truly meant through his actions.

Especially Tang Jin, whose expression grew increasingly aloof. She noticed Qin Ming looking at her. Was this "evil intent that refuses to die"? Did he still want to challenge her?

"I..." At this moment, Ling Yu spoke, sweat beading on his forehead, as if he was struggling immensely, trying to break through a mental barrier and make a certain decision.

He clenched his fists, then released them, his expression complex, his face shifting from tense to relaxed, then to taut, changing again and again.

Then, he let out a turbid breath and said, "In this First Realm, I am not your opponent. In my understanding, you are already among the very best, truly possessing legendary Ancestral Master-level talent!"

After saying this, his spirit sagged somewhat, and his entire being relaxed, as if he had crossed a hurdle in his heart.

Ling Yu admitted that he was inferior to others in the First Realm, and his earlier mental block had not turned into an unbreakable knot.

Then, he raised his head, his eyes like lightning, and declared, "I am willing to use all my strength to fight you!"

Although no unbreakable knot had formed in his heart, hearing the other party repeatedly tell him to use the power of the Second Realm still filled him with some indignation!

He refused to believe that anyone could defy and defeat a "Young Ancestor"!

Even though his title of Young Ancestor was the result of various parties promoting him and hadn't been fully verified.

Qin Ming smiled and said, "Alright, I'm quite looking forward to it. Your lineage, with its system built by combining the Immortal Path and the New Life Path, let me see just how strong it is, and what unique techniques it possesses."

After he finished speaking, not only was Ling Yu's battle intent soaring, but even Tang Jin's expression changed outside the arena.

After being challenged, did the young man in the arena now want to, in turn, weigh the strength of their system?

Tang Jin secretly transmitted her voice: "Ling Yu, since you're going to step into the Second Realm to act, then give me one hundred and twenty percent of your power, fully unleash it, and you are not allowed to lose!"

"Understood, Senior Sister. I won't allow him to challenge you!" Ling Yu secretly replied.

At the same time, he also wanted to know just how terrifying this young man with Ancestral Master-level talent truly was, and how high that insurmountable mountain actually stood!

Qin Ming said, "You should recover first. I hope you can display your strongest form."

"You!" Ling Yu's black hair fluttered around his head. His already boiling battle intent was now fully ignited!

"Come back and recuperate," Master Wu said.

Ling Yu threw caution to the wind. He immediately broke a piece of high-quality crystal on the spot and drank the silver liquid sealed within. In an instant, all his injuries healed!

Afterward, he changed out of his tattered black clothes and put on a set of gleaming silver battle armor. It wasn't some extraordinary treasure; he simply didn't want to fight in ragged attire.

"Alright, let me see how you defy and defeat me in the Second Realm!" Ling Yu strode forward.

This time, his aura completely transformed. Heavenly Light emanated outwards, pure white and sacred, illuminating the area as if he stood within a divine moon.

This area became enveloped in mist, interweaving flames, and a kaleidoscope of colors. All of this was the result of him employing a wondrous technique.

However, all of this was an illusion. Ling Yu had immediately used another killer move from his dao lineage; he did not want to lose again.

Boom!

A deafening thunderclap echoed throughout the martial arts arena. The entire void seemed to smell scorched.

Qian Chuan, Tang Jun, and Cheng Rui all felt their minds go blank, their souls threatening to be shaken out of their bodies. This terrified them, sending chills down their spines.

They were outside the arena and already felt such effects. One could imagine how heart-stopping it was inside.

At Mountain River Academy, many students passing by outside Martial Arena No. 1 were astonished. Was it thundering? The sound was simply too loud, and their souls were unstable, their consciousness hazy, on the verge of leaving their bodies.

In the martial arts arena, the two elders exclaimed in awe.

"Your lineage is truly remarkable! After being improved, it allows disciples to unleash the legendary Soul-鎮雷 even at the Outer Saint level!"

In the arena, Ling Yu's eyes were deep, his black hair cascaded, and his silver armor clanged, radiating light in all directions, looking quite heroic.

He unleashed one crimson lightning bolt after another, weaving them in the void, covering Qin Ming's position.

Qin Ming was fearless. Heavenly Light energy circulated around his body, followed by layers of five-colored light mist, hazy and indistinct. He seemed impervious to all methods, even the so-called crimson lightning bolts couldn't penetrate.

That five-colored light mist could actually block the Soul-鎮雷!

Ling Yu continuously unleashed the legendary Soul-鎮雷. Normally, a single lightning bolt would be enough to shake an opponent's Consciousness Spiritual Light out of their body, thereby killing them.

He didn't aim for that; he only wanted to shake the opponent's soul, just enough for it to show slight signs of leaving the body.

Because he was executing a combo kill technique from his dual-path system.

One could see Ling Yu's Consciousness Spiritual Light also emerging, emitting dazzling divine radiance.

With his talent, he could temper a wisp of Pure Yang Consciousness Spiritual Light himself, but this one, tempered with the help of his senior brothers and sisters, was even more vibrant.

In an instant, this sun-like ball of light began to transform, smoothing out and condensing into a mirror, shining towards Qin Ming.

"Pure Yang Soul-Illuminating Mirror!" an elder exclaimed. This was originally a high-level Immortal Path technique, but it had been simplified and improved by the grandmasters of this lineage, allowing it to be used even in the Yellow Court Realm.

At this moment, Ling Yu used the Soul-鎮雷 to shake the opponent's soul and the Pure Yang Soul-Illuminating Mirror to illuminate it. Each was a killer move, and combined, their power was incomparably immense.

If it were any other opponent, they definitely wouldn't be able to block it; their consciousness and soul light would be blasted out of their body.

However, Qin Ming's soul was as stable as a bedrock, unshakable in the slightest.

He was covered by five-colored immortal light, and with a clang, a faint, five-colored long blade appeared in his hand.

"This... how is this possible?!"

Everyone present found it unreal. In the New Life domain, how could Heavenly Light take shape?

Yet, although the blade was unstable, its tip smoky and misty, it had indeed formed.

"That's the Five Elements Blade! He actually cultivated five different attribute wondrous techniques!" Zhao Minghui exclaimed.

Qin Ming moved like a phantom wandering a sea of night mist, appearing sometimes left, sometimes right. His blade shattered the Soul-鎮雷, causing the crimson lightning bolts woven around him to completely disperse. Then, like a rainbow piercing the sun, the five-colored blade thrust towards the Pure Yang Soul-Illuminating Mirror!
