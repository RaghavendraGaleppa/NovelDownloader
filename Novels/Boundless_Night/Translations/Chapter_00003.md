# Chapter 3: The Wilderness

After dusk fell, the tranquility was broken, and every household bustled to the Fire Spring to retrieve Sunstones.

Qin Ming was ready to depart at any moment, fully armed with a hunting fork, short blade, bow, arrows, and other gear. He had already eaten the flatbread Lu Ze brought, but he hadn't told him about his plans to go out, fearing he would be dissuaded. Qin Ming didn't want to put himself in undue danger; he intended to try his luck in a relatively safe area. He had pondered for a long time, recalling a silhouette he had seen in the mountains during autumn. Based on that creature's habits, it should still be dwelling nearby.

"I hope it's still there and brings me a surprise."

Outside, it gradually grew quiet; no one was going to retrieve Sunstones anymore. Qin Ming set off, encountering two villagers along the way. He greeted them with a smile, then quickly moved on before they could fully react. He passed the location of the Fire Spring and entered the pitch-black world.

The wilderness environment was exceedingly harsh. Qin Ming trudged through the deep snow, with only his chest and head visible, the lower half of his body entirely obscured. The weather was exceptionally cold, and the white mist from his breath froze into frost on his eyebrows and hair tips. Even in the early night, the world was dim, and distant objects were obscured. Qin Ming held his hunting fork, trudging arduously, his journey forward proving quite difficult.

Finally, after walking about four *li*, he neared his destination. Ahead was a dense, dark expanse of trees. Although still some distance away, their outlines were discernible. Qin Ming's target was the edge of the mountain forest; he wouldn't venture too deep. He stumbled into the dense forest, where most trees were bare, their branches heavy with snow, save for a few species.

Qin Ming stopped, carefully recalling the creature's movements he had observed earlier. He had once found a tree hollow in that area, perhaps one of its nests. "Its size is larger than others of its kind; it's likely mutated. If I can find its main nest, the harvest should be considerable."

After a brief pause, Qin Ming continued onward. The forest was pitch black, occasionally punctuated by the sudden cry of a strange bird, making the desolate area feel even more eerie.

Suddenly, Qin Ming's body tensed. Faintly, almost imperceptibly, he caught a whiff of a subtle decaying odor. This was highly unusual. Gripping his hunting fork with both hands, he scanned his surroundings, poised for a fight. Abruptly, he thrust the sharp steel fork in his hand upwards, towards the sky above his head! He heard an unusual rustling sound and pinpointed the source of the smell. At the same time, he looked up and saw what it was.

A dark silhouette hung upside down from a branch a dozen meters high. It possessed a pallid, old man's face and was diving down furiously towards Qin Ming's head. In this deathly quiet dense forest, such a sudden appearance was truly chilling. Fortunately, Qin Ming's reaction was swift. He had sensed something amiss in advance, and his steel fork quickly met the creature in mid-air. A shrill cry echoed through the forest, sending shivers down one's spine. The creature didn't charge head-on; instead, it veered off to the side when still several meters away. A cold wind picked up as it spread its powerful wings, soaring into the night sky through a gap in the forest. After a brief circle, it flew away and vanished.

Although he couldn't see it clearly, Qin Ming still identified its origins. It was a Human-Faced Vulture, a carrion-eating raptor. It had a grayish-black eagle body, and its entire face, apart from the beak, was indistinguishable from a pale, wrinkled old man's face. Its weight typically did not exceed forty *jin*. Normally, it wouldn't actively attack living adults; it only consumed corpses. Was it behaving so abnormally because prey was scarce at this stage? Qin Ming remained cautiously on guard, but after a long wait, it did not reappear.

He was not far from his destination and couldn't give up now. After a brief rest, he set off again.

"This should be it."

This area was dominated by Scots pines, broadleaf trees, and white birches. Qin Ming confirmed he hadn't come to the wrong place; he found the tree hollow he had seen before. Although the forest was dim, from a few meters away, he could clearly see that the edge of the tree hollow was remarkably clean. This was not a good sign. If the creature was hibernating inside the tree hollow, its exhaled moisture would surely form frost around the entrance in such bitter cold. To say he wasn't disappointed was impossible. Qin Ming frowned slightly. Could it be that the creature wasn't residing in this area at all?

He took a deep breath, preparing to search the vicinity carefully. His right hand firmly gripped the hunting fork, his left clasped the short blade, maintaining a constant defensive posture, for no one could predict the dangers of the wilderness. Qin Ming slowly explored, searching without making any sound.

Half a *ke* later, he saw traces left by some animal on the snow, and immediately felt a spark of hope!

Suddenly, a vast expanse of rosy light surged from the mountains ahead, instantly illuminating the dense forest. Qin Ming was startled, then became extremely vigilant. He used this opportunity to carefully observe his surroundings, checking for any hidden large beasts. At the same time, he quickly scanned the vicinity for any suspicious tree hollows. Soon, the bright rosy light vanished, and the world once again returned to an inky blackness. That was "Earthlight," emanating from the deep Fire Spring within the earth's layers, appearing only occasionally. It was generally more common when the weather grew warmer, especially in summer. Sometimes, the Earthlight's emanation could last for a day or two, influencing celestial phenomena and potentially bringing large rain clouds. At those times, dense raindrops accompanied by iridescent mists made the world exceptionally splendid and truly beautiful to behold. For people living without daylight, that was the most beautiful sight.

The dense forest returned to its gloom, but Qin Ming revealed a genuinely bright smile, for he had just discovered another tree hollow, this one adorned with ice crystals. He moved slowly through the snow, his slight sounds muffled by the rising cold wind. He tiptoed to a large tree as thick as a water bucket, observing the tree hollow that was somewhat high off the ground. He raised his hunting fork, barely reaching it.

Qin Ming put down his hunting fork, then suddenly leaped, bursting from the snow. He embraced the tree trunk and climbed with force, his body agile and swift, directly reaching the tree hollow. The short blade in his right hand swung out, striking the entrance area with a dull thud. At the same time, a creature that was about to rush out quickly recoiled, narrowly escaping being sliced by the sharp blade. Qin Ming hadn't expected to actually corner the creature within the tree hollow; it was an unexpected pleasant surprise. In his estimations, if he could find its main nest and retrieve all its stored food, it would count as a success, yielding a significant harvest.

Inside the tree hollow, there was continuous movement, accompanied by hurried squeaks. The entrance wasn't very large; Qin Ming found it somewhat difficult to extend his hand inside. He repeatedly swung his blade; this section of the tree had long since withered, and with just a few strikes, the hollow became larger. He quickly took out a beast-hide bag, slipped it over his hand, and immediately began to catch the creature. From the dark tree hollow, frantic squeals emerged. Qin Ming's entire arm was inside, feeling a barrage of wild bumps. Fortunately, the beast-hide bag was thick enough, or he would certainly have been bitten. He grabbed the prey and swiftly pulled it out.

He took a Sunstone from his bosom and shone it into the depths of the tree hollow. Joy immediately appeared on his face: inside were wild walnuts, chestnuts, red dates, and more—a trove of dried goods. These were his primary targets. The feeling of hunger was unbearable, and these dried fruits were more than enough to sate him; they were life-saving provisions, making Qin Ming's clear eyes glow with fervent light. He tilted his head, looking at the small beast held in his hand. Its entire body, covered in fiery red fur, shimmered under the Sunstone's glow, smoother than silk. This was a red squirrel. A normal individual wouldn't exceed one *jin*, but this one weighed over two *jin*, clearly mutated. It was gnawing at the beast-hide bag on Qin Ming's hand, wanting to escape but unable to. Its fiery red, shimmering fur was glowing; its value was certainly not low. Qin Ming took out an iron wire, deftly tied it up, tightened the bindings, and then hung it on a tree.

Next came the joy of the harvest. He scooped out handful after handful of various dried fruits from the tree hollow, quickly filling the previously deflated beast-hide bag until it gradually swelled. Finally, he weighed it: over eight *jin*. Beside him, the mutated red squirrel, hanging upside down, its black gem-like eyes wide and round, squeaked incessantly, seemingly filled with immense rage. Qin Ming felt it was scolding him.

"You're so heavy, how could eight *jin* of winter food be enough for you to eat?" Qin Ming hung it on his hunting fork and, holding a Sunstone, searched nearby. Every winter, the snow accumulated thickly. This type of mutated creature generally wouldn't bury its food underground, or else it wouldn't be able to find it itself. As expected, Qin Ming found a second tree hollow nearby, then a third. Including the first tree hollow he found that had no frost, all of them surprisingly contained "stored provisions."

He cracked open a pile of wild walnuts and ate a handful of chestnuts, finding them truly fragrant. Then he scrubbed red dates with snow and ate five in a row, his mouth filled with sweetness. Qin Ming was no longer hungry, his refined face beaming with a happy smile. These dried fruits were delicious and, more importantly, could resolve his current predicament. A cunning rabbit has three burrows, but this glowing-furred red squirrel had four nests, storing over thirty *jin* of food. Truly worthy of being a mutated creature. Qin Ming filled more than half of his beast-hide bag.

"Squeak, squeak..." The mutated red squirrel initially struggled violently, squeaking incessantly. But upon seeing all four of its nests found and emptied, it suddenly stiffened and became motionless. Qin Ming was astonished. He shook it. Had it just played dead? He had long heard that this type of mutated mountain beast possessed a physique far surpassing its kind, and was extremely intelligent, but also very high-strung. He hadn't expected it could actually die of sheer anger.

"Perfect," he muttered to himself. "Little Wen Rui said he wanted to eat meat; I can boil a pot of meat soup now." He was surprised he could fulfill the child's wish so quickly.

***

In Twin Tree Village, some villagers were discussing. Someone mentioned that Qin Ming had gone into the wilderness fully armed, and from his posture, it looked as if he was going to hunt large beasts! Lu Ze also received the news, his brows deeply furrowed. How could that boy venture out alone? Surely he wasn't going to hunt a bear, was he?

***

Qin Ming stood on a high ground, realizing he was very close to the mountain peak. This was a low mountain in the outermost region of the dense forest. Unfortunately, he searched for a long time but found no other squirrel hollows. He reached the mountaintop and looked forward. The forest was a dark, dense expanse, and while the vast mountain ranges stood tall, he could only discern vague black silhouettes. Deep within the mountains, there were actually brilliantly bright areas, but they were obscured by the vast night mist, with only faint, shimmering light escaping. Qin Ming knew that place signified the unknown, mystery, and danger—a realm he was not yet capable of treading upon.
