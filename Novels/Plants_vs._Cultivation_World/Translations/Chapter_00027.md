# Chapter 27: The Peashooter  

Managing the spirit fields, accumulating solar essence, and cultivating spells became Gu Mo's daily routine. Additionally, his perfected-level Cleansing Technique remained an indispensable practice. Thanks to the marrow-cleansing effects of this technique, his body underwent gradual transformations.  

When he eventually broke through to the next realm, these accumulated benefits would erupt all at once, granting him physical and spiritual strength surpassing that of his peers.  

However, without a method to conceal his cultivation level, Gu Mo couldn't train at full capacity. Even though he now harvested five portions of solar essence daily, his inferior spiritual roots only allowed him to absorb one portion before needing three days of rest.  

At this rate, reaching the second level of Qi Refining would take an unknown amount of time.  

A month had passed since his last planting session, and Gu Mo had successfully gathered five Sunflowers. If he absorbed all five portions of solar essence daily, his cultivation speed would skyrocket to an astonishing 15 times the norm—surpassing even those with superior spiritual roots.  

But he didn’t dare take such a risk. Instead, he used the daily solar essence to expand the black mist space and feed the koi fish.  

After feeding the koi solar essence a second time, three more of its scales turned golden. Gu Mo wondered if the fish would only undergo a transformation once all its scales turned gold.  

But with nearly a thousand scales, this would require over 300 portions of solar essence—a staggering amount. Even with five Sunflowers, it would take him two months to gather that much. Gambling such a massive investment on the koi seemed unwise.  

Expanding the black mist space was the better choice. As the space grew, so did the available area, and more importantly, the vending machine revealed a corner of a new product icon as the mist receded.  

The vending machine didn’t just sell Sunflowers—there were other items too. This piqued Gu Mo’s curiosity, so he dedicated all his solar essence to expanding the space.  

In about three days, the new product icon would be fully revealed.  

Crushing the latest five portions of solar essence, Gu Mo watched as the surrounding black mist dissipated further under the radiant light. As the mist cleared, the vending machine’s new product icon finally came into view.  

**Name:** Peashooter  
**Grade:** 1st Tier, Low Grade  
**Effect:** Fires pea seeds to attack enemies.  
**Planting Requirement:** 1st Tier Spirit Field.  

Gu Mo was stunned. *Isn’t this the Peashooter from Plants vs. Zombies?* Then he recalled the Sunflower—its effect was strikingly similar to the Sunflower in the game, though he hadn’t made the connection before due to the different names.  

Now, with the Peashooter’s appearance, it was clear the vending machine sold plants from *Plants vs. Zombies*.  

Unlike the Sunflower, which boosted cultivation, the Peashooter was an offensive plant. Its exact effectiveness would have to be tested firsthand.  

**"100 portions of solar essence?!"**  

Glancing at the price, Gu Mo raised an eyebrow. This was far more expensive than the Sunflower.  

With five Sunflowers, it would take him 20 days to gather enough.  

*"Five Sunflowers still aren’t enough,"* Gu Mo mused, exiting the black mist space with a frown.  

Increasing the number of Sunflowers was risky, so he decided to wait until the next harvest of Spirit Jade Rice. With more spirit stones, he could activate the field’s protective formation and plant more Sunflowers safely.  

Twenty days passed in the blink of an eye for a cultivator. When Gu Mo finally fed 100 portions of solar essence into the vending machine, the purchase button beneath the Peashooter lit up.  

He clicked it.  

A seed tumbled out. Gu Mo caught it and examined it closely, but it appeared ordinary. Without hesitation, he left the black mist space and headed to the spirit field.  

He had already decided where to plant the Peashooter. Hiding it among the Sunflowers wasn’t ideal—five Sunflowers were already concealed there, and adding a distinctly different plant would draw attention. Instead, he chose to plant it among the Spirit Jade Rice, using the crop as cover.  

Moving to the center of the field, Gu Mo shifted a few rice stalks aside and planted the seed.  

In mere moments, the seed took root and sprouted. Within a few breaths, a vibrant green plant stood before him—a half-human-tall stem with three broad leaves at its base, topped by a pod-shaped "cannon" with a curled leaf at the back. It looked oddly endearing.  

*"Not bad at all!"*  

Gu Mo was pleasantly surprised. Unlike the Sunflower, which took a day to grow, the Peashooter sprouted almost instantly. This meant it had immediate combat potential.  

In battle, given a little time, he could plant Peashooters to assist him.  

Now, he needed to test its combat effectiveness. As an offensive plant, its value depended entirely on its strength.  

But how? He couldn’t exactly test it on himself.  

As he pondered, the Peashooter suddenly swiveled its pod-cannon, locking onto something. Gu Mo felt the field’s spiritual energy being drawn into the plant’s roots, gathering in its cannon.  

***Bang!***  

A green pea shot out, striking a shadowy figure in the distance.  

***Squeak!***  

A sharp cry followed as the figure collapsed. Gu Mo realized it was a Black Spirit Rat—a notorious pest that had destroyed many seedlings in the field.  

These rats were notoriously elusive, but the Peashooter had instantly detected and killed one.  

Judging by the attack’s power, the Peashooter’s strength was roughly equivalent to a full-force strike from a first-level Qi Refining cultivator.  

While not overwhelmingly powerful, the Peashooter’s auto-targeting and autonomous attack capabilities were impressive. With one in the field, Black Spirit Rats would no longer be a problem.  

But the real surprise came a month later. Like the Sunflower, the Peashooter’s attack power continued to grow over time.
