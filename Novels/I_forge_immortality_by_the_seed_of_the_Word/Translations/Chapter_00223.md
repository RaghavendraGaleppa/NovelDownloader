# Chapter 221: Innate Grand Formation

The next day.

The mana fluctuations swirling within the room gradually subsided, eventually vanishing without a trace. Bang! Zhang Jing's figure lightly landed on the ground.

His spiritual sense gently swept over the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Immortal Seed, then lingered on the sixth layer. Above the golden cloud, a great sun bathed in shimmering light faintly appeared, its core radiating an increasingly dense violet hue, seemingly on the verge of solidifying.

After a careful assessment, Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed with anticipation. “At this rate, it will take about three months for the Mind-Thought Golden Sun to condense a wisp of Post-natal Violet Qi. That's roughly one percent a day, isn't it?” He recalled that while bidding for the Cosmic River Gold Crystal previously, he had inadvertently seen someone auctioning off a wisp of Post-natal Violet Qi. He had paid special attention to it then. Perhaps due to the generally high prices of enlightenment-type resources, the final auction price had reached a staggering 120 million Qi Luck. One wisp was roughly one hundred strands.

In other words... doing nothing but staying in Sanyuan City every day, allowing the Mind-Thought Golden Sun to gather the thoughts of living beings and condense Post-natal Violet Qi, he could gain nearly 12,000 Qi Luck daily. It didn't seem like much, but this was entirely passive income. Over years and months, it would accumulate into a massive sum.

Moreover, Zhang Jing hadn't forgotten that the current coverage of the Mind-Thought Golden Sun barely encompassed one district of Sanyuan City. As his cultivation advanced and the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Immortal Seed upgraded, the Mind-Thought Golden Sun's reach would significantly expand. “If it could cover the entire Sanyuan City, then at least one wisp of Post-natal Violet Qi could be condensed daily, which is nearly 1.2 million Qi Luck.” Zhang Jing clicked his tongue. This gain was already quite terrifying. For high-level Immortal Dao cultivators, time was the least valuable commodity; a century or two was but the blink of an eye.

Of course, to reach that level, Zhang Jing estimated he would need to upgrade the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud to an eighth-grade Immortal Seed, or for his own cultivation to leap another level. Furthermore—with a thought, he summoned the information: [Grand Unity Heavenly Stellar Gods' Natal Realms] Natal Realms: First Layer Innate Deity: Azure Cloud Immortal “Three hundred years... if only I had enough general experience points,” Zhang Jing murmured to himself.

His thoughts returned to reality. “Sanba, accompany me out.”

“Yes, Master,” Lu Sanba, who had been waiting outside the room for a long time, immediately transformed into a giant white deer. A clear deer cry echoed through the small courtyard. Zhang Jing stepped out of the room and lightly landed on its broad back. In an instant, Lu Sanba, carrying his master, transformed into a jade-green streak of light and soared straight into the clouds.

Mid-air, Zhang Jing instinctively looked east. His gaze, as if tangible, seemed to penetrate through layers of obstacles, directly peering at Mount Lingshu, thirty thousand li away. “A supreme-grade spiritual land?” A gentle voice, tinged with a faint smile, instantly sounded, then quickly vanished into the wind. Along with it, Zhang Jing and Lu Sanba’s figures also disappeared.

Half an hour later, the streak of light Lu Sanba had transformed into quietly landed on the peak of a small mountain several hundred zhang high. On its back, Zhang Jing slowly rose, his gaze unconsciously drawn to the region where a cluster of peaks converged, a hundred li away. A flicker of admiration immediately passed through his eyes.

In his sight, thirty-six colossal peaks were scattered like stars, some strangely perilous, others vast and magnificent. Waterfalls cascaded like silk ribbons, and great rivers wove through them. Spirit tigers leaped across ravines, spirit apes scaled cliffs, a hundred birds spread their wings, and a multitude of beasts lurked within the forests. Under the scrutiny of his Heavenly Immortal Eyes, the aura of these thirty-six divine peaks complemented each other, interconnecting to form an unknown Innate Grand Formation. It drew boundless stellar power from above and channeled three vast, ancient earth veins from below. However, this Innate Grand Formation, or rather, this spiritual land, seemed not yet fully matured, exuding a subtle sense of incompleteness. What was ingenious was that despite its imperfection, under the shroud of this unknown Innate Grand Formation, the entire Mount Lingshu region's aura was meticulously concealed. Unless one approached to observe closely, let alone ordinary cultivators, even those in the Dharma Aspect realm or even the Dao Unification realm would find it difficult to discern its miraculous qualities.

“Mount Lingshu~” “What a Mount Lingshu, what a place where immortal spirits gather! Haha, Li Jiu and his son truly didn't lie to me. It really is a supreme-grade spiritual land, perhaps even more.” Zhang Jing recalled the information about supreme-grade spiritual lands in his mind. But he suddenly realized that Mount Lingshu clearly surpassed that category. “Since it can nurture an Innate Grand Formation, it must contain an innate divine object. Thirty-six Heavenly Stellar, exactly matching the number of my thirty-six Natal Realms. Could it be that destiny has its own arrangements, and this spiritual land of Mount Lingshu is fated with me, Zhang?” Zhang Jing's eyes flashed. The more he thought about it, the more reasonable it seemed. With excitement in his heart, he was about to step forward.

However, the next moment, three gazes, heavy as ancient divine mountains, suddenly fell upon Zhang Jing. At the same time, three voices, ancient and tinged with coldness, echoed almost simultaneously in his ears. “Halt, stranger! This place belongs to my Sanyuan City. Take another step, and you shall be killed without mercy!” “Halt, stranger! This place belongs to my Yushui Sect. Take another step, and you shall be killed without mercy!” “Halt, stranger! This place belongs to my Dragon Firmament Sword Gate. Take another step, and you shall be killed without mercy!” Zhang Jing’s movement paused. Only then did he recall that Li Jie, who had cultivated in the Azure Feather Army of Sanyuan City, seemed to have warned him that three factions’ Dharma Aspect realm old ancestors personally guarded the area around Mount Lingshu. Not to mention people, not even a fly could enter. A flicker of surprise appeared in his eyes.

Zhang Jing slowly raised his head. Three colossal Dharma Aspect figures, a hundred zhang tall, instantly came into view. One was a Daoist with a sword in both hands, his body entwined with a flood dragon; another was a monstrous fish covered in red scales, with dense, wide feathered wings sprouting from its body, its roar like that of a sheep; and the last was a golden toad carrying a huge copper coin on its back, its croak like thunder. “Interesting!” Zhang Jing shook his head. Then, at his signal, Lu Sanba slowly retreated, turning into a bright streak of light, and swiftly flew towards Sanyuan City.

He indeed wanted to have a showdown with these three Dharma Aspect realm cultivators. Or even without personally acting, he had ways to subdue them. But certainly not now. Seeing that this spiritual land was at a critical juncture of successful maturation, if his rash involvement disrupted the balance and damaged its internal Qi, causing its cultivation and evolution to fail and become imperfect, Zhang Jing absolutely could not accept such an outcome. He might as well wait until the spiritual land had fully matured before reconsidering. A few years wouldn't make a difference anyway. Besides, this was the Clear Firmament Profound Heaven, and his cheap master even had a Dao avatar in the Crimson Bright Grand Luminous Grotto-Heaven above. What was there to fear? Could the spiritual land grow legs and run away?

“But—what if these three destroy the spiritual essence during their struggle and ruin my future cultivation ground? After all, these are three factions, and eventually, someone will be eliminated. What if one of them turns desperate?” Zhang Jing’s eyes flickered as he thought to himself. He always considered problems by anticipating the worst-case scenarios. At this thought, “No, I must make arrangements early.” Zhang Jing's heart tightened. As he pondered, he seemed to recall something, and a white jade command token quietly appeared in his hand. “The Ice Crystal Immortal Spirit race that Aunt Bai Chan gifted me—they say there are many strong individuals among them. It seems it’s time to activate them. I originally planned to summon them during the establishment of my cultivation ground.”
