**Chapter 125: The Book That Stumped Generations of Grandmasters**

Qin Ming also smiled and said, "Qingyue mentioned it to me. I didn't expect it to be so soon."

"Who else could it be besides her?" Meng Xinghai urged him to go and "test his功 (gōng, merits/achievements)."

Qin Ming nodded. "There are indeed others. Tang Xumi, Hu Tingwen, Su Jingchu, and other core disciples owe me a famous cultivation method." Those individuals had mentioned discovering a remnant scroll of the *Divine Ape Force* in the Scripture Pavilion—a renowned Skyglow Force technique. He wondered if they would fulfill their promise, and even if they did, the book would likely be sent to Li Qingyue first.

Meng Xinghai remarked, "You're quite something, kid. Your trip wasn't without considerable gains."

Qin Ming nodded, already content with the abundant harvest this time. He wasted no time and quickly headed with Meng Xinghai to meet the person.

In the archaic living room, ancient artifacts like bronze trees and three-legged tripods were displayed. Calming incense slowly burned in a censer, its wispy smoke rising like delicate threads. An elderly man sat there sipping tea. He was quite old, with white hair, yet his complexion was ruddy and his spirit vibrant. Meng Xinghai greeted him, "Uncle Li." Seeing this, Qin Ming respectfully lowered his own generation and paid his respects to this Elder Li.

When the old man opened and closed his eyes, they resembled two golden lamps, brimming with vitality. He rose, smiling and nodding. "Excellent, good child. I specifically came here this time to thank you, young Qin, for helping Qingyue successfully acquire the Near-Immortal Object." This was someone from a reclusive family, and likely a close elder relative of Li Qingyue.

"Actually, I didn't do much. Even without me, Qingyue would definitely have come out on top in the end," Qin Ming said humbly.

The old man smiled, not dwelling on the matter. "This time, I've brought a special cultivation method, one with quite a history, and it's extremely difficult to practice." He took out three pages of paper and said, "Take a look first, ponder it slowly, no need to rush."

Hearing this, Qin Ming grew curious. What kind of cultivation method was this, to warrant a highly respected elder personally making the trip? He took the papers, noting they were clearly recent copies, the characters still faintly perfumed with ink.

Li Qingyun spoke, "This is identical to the original, even every stroke of every character was copied precisely, to ensure no hidden mysteries were lost."

Qin Ming was astonished by the elder's words. Such solemn treatment implied it was truly extraordinary. That wasn't all. Li Qingyun then produced three copper plates, each corresponding to a blurry human figure, outlined with numerous intricate lines. He explained, "These are the three illustrations corresponding to the three scripture pages, also reproduced at exact scale, even matching their blurry state."

Qin Ming nodded. The other party's attention to detail made his expression serious. He held the papers, comparing them to the copper plates, and studied them carefully. Soon, he frowned. Who wrote this scripture? It was too generalized. It spoke broadly of the physical body and spirit, setting ambitious, long-term goals.

"Lifespan equivalent to heaven and earth, without end..." Qin Ming read to this point and exhaled slowly. He was still practicing Skyglow Force, just beginning his path of renewal, yet these three pages were already talking about longevity. One should know that even the old seniors from the Outer Lands, and the top experts of the Esoteric Sect, were not immortal; they all had a day when their lives would end. Moreover, their lifespans were not exaggerated. Most crucially, Qin Ming felt the three pages of scripture were "empty talk"! There was no detailed method at all; the words on the paper were extremely vague, and combined with the three blurry diagrams, they could be interpreted in countless ways. If this weren't Li Qingyue's elder, he would have taken him for a charlatan or a swindler.

Li Qingyun, sipping his tea, said, "Don't put pressure on yourself. There's plenty of time. This scripture has stumped too many people. Even those who gained some insight, their insights varied."

"What did others comprehend?" Qin Ming asked.

Li Qingyun replied, "Very few people can comprehend anything. But those who did gain something were all renowned figures. Among them, some gained greatly increased lifespans in their old age, extending their lives by half; some who were originally dull suddenly became enlightened; some with ordinary talent suddenly had their root bones transformed; some whose bodies withered, managed to live a second life through their spirit." He spoke with longing, lost in thought.

Meng Xinghai added from the side, "Those people mentioned just now were all great figures, such as a revitalizing grandmaster of Pure Yang Palace, an old abbot of Yin-Yang Temple, and the progenitor of Five Elements Palace, among others."

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming was greatly astonished. The content of these three pages was more significant than he had imagined, involving historically famous figures. "Let me take another closer look." His expression became unprecedentedly solemn, and he immersed himself completely, earnestly trying to comprehend its mysteries.

Li Qingyun reassured him, "Truly, there's no need to rush. I'll be here for half a month, so there's plenty of time. As long as your physical body or spirit has even a slight special sensation, it means you're fated with it and should gain something. Because historically, those famous figures were all like this; they initially only felt something unusual, and it was only after years of practice and comprehension that they eventually 'transformed.'"

Meng Xinghai explained the origin of this scripture. It was found deep within the Night Fog World during the Great Reclamation era, discovered by accident, but only a few people could gain anything from it. Even those with profound cultivation might not be able to comprehend it. For instance, the grandmaster of Heavenshaking Force, whose cultivation was said to be world-shaking and whose physical strength was at its peak, almost capable of tearing the sky. Yet, he studied this book for three years without even a shred of insight, finally getting so angry he almost tore the book apart. Had someone not stopped him, the book, despite its special material, might not have survived.

Qin Ming studied for half an hour, his brow feeling hot and somewhat sore. He stopped to rest briefly.

Li Qingyun put down his teacup. "In a sense, it can be considered a mother scripture. Perhaps it won't give you a specific method, but it can bring you many inspirations and possibilities." This scripture was considered more suitable for those pursuing the mutation path, as most of the famous figures who gained something from comprehending it historically followed this path.

Seeing Qin Ming temporarily put down the three pages, Meng Xinghai also spoke, "In the Outer Lands, as powerful as a certain old senior, Li Qingxu's master, over a hundred years ago, was extremely ambitious and incredibly arrogant. He also studied this book for five years, but ultimately gained nothing. It's said that his face was black for over half a year because of it."

Qin Ming was surprised; this book seemed too famous.

Li Qingyun nodded. "Indeed. Currently, the original copy of this book is in the Outer Lands Pure Land, collected and preserved by them, but it has been gathering dust in that Scripture Pavilion for many years." This was frustrating. A book useful for the mutation path was in the hands of those from the Outer Lands, which sufficiently illustrated the current status, position, and significant disparity between the two paths.

Meng Xinghai said, "In this era, according to public records, only a very few individuals have gained even a little from comprehending this book."

"It seems truly difficult. Only a few people in an entire era gain some insight," Qin Ming said, resuming his study. He noticed his forehead heating up again. His heart stirred. Was this the so-called unusual sensation?

Li Qingyun nodded. "That's already quite a lot. Looking at the last thousand years, how many people could understand this book? To be precise, no one has ever fully understood the entire text; they've only comprehended parts of it."

Qin Ming had to stop again. He took a sip of tea, trying to feel that state and sense any abnormal changes within himself.

Meng Xinghai said, "The Li family this time invited Lu Zhen, a core disciple of Yin-Yang Temple, to temporarily act as a Golden-Armored Guard to help Li Qingxu contend for the Near-Immortal Object. Besides sending many precious items to Yin-Yang Temple, the Li family reportedly also promised Lu Zhen to arrange for him to study this book in the Outer Lands." Although this book was in the Outer Lands, it wasn't sealed away. If one paid a certain price, they could go and study it. For example, Cui Chongxuan, who practiced Six Imperial Force, had his Cui family actively making arrangements for him to experience it once there. As for Cui Chonghe, a core disciple and undisputed seed-level figure of the Outer Lands, he had already studied this book. Whether he gained anything was unknown to outsiders. As an outsider, Qin Ming's ability to read this scripture this time was naturally due to Li Qingyue's active efforts.

Meng Xinghai, fearing Qin Ming might feel pressured if he couldn't comprehend it, consoled him, "Studying this scripture relies entirely on fate. After all, even the grandmaster of Heavenshaking Force was indifferent to it and grumbled as he threw it out the window. If it really doesn't work out, we can always switch to another wondrous technique."

"Are grandmaster-level figures that down-to-earth?" Qin Ming asked, surprised.

Meng Xinghai said, "You seem to be missing the point. I'm telling you to relax."

"I am relaxing. My brow is a little warm."

"Relaxing is good… huh?!"

"What did you say?!"

At once, both Meng Xinghai and Li Qingyun put down their teacups, their eyes gradually lighting up with brilliant beams as they stared at him.

Qin Ming said, "I've started to feel something, but it's too faint. Let me ponder it more."

Li Qingyun shot up. How many great figures had this book stumped? It was hailed as one of the most difficult ancient scriptures, truly only comprehensible through "fate." In fact, not just the grandmaster of Heavenshaking Force, but even the grandmaster of Six Imperial Force had secretly tried to "ponder" it, only to draw a complete blank. However, that grandmaster was quite concerned with his reputation and warned those who knew not to leak it, or else he would use Six Imperial Skyglow to split them into 108 pieces.

Li Qingyun himself had read the three pages of scripture in his early years but gained no insight. Now, to actually witness a youth potentially comprehending something, how could he not be shocked? This was on par with the legendary famous figures!

Meng Xinghai's emotions surged. The young Qin, whom he favored, seemed to always exceed expectations. Such a performance in front of Uncle Li made him feel immensely proud. He had originally thought Qin Ming might "fall short" this time, but facts proved that young Qin was still as formidable as ever, able to extract some essence even from one of the most difficult ancient scriptures.

Qin Ming said, "My state isn't that good today. Comprehending it is very strenuous; my forehead keeps heating up and aching. I'll delve deeper. I feel like I've grasped something; these three diagrams seem to be getting clearer, different."

"He can comprehend parts of this ancient scripture even when his state isn't good?" Li Qingyun was suspicious, wanting to ask Meng Xinghai if this youth always talked like this. He truly felt put out; his own meticulous and serene attempts had been useless, which was rather infuriating! Li Qingyun felt that if Li Qingxu's master knew, or if those old geezers heard Qin Ming say such things, they'd probably want to jump out and beat him up.

"He usually comprehends scriptures very quickly," Meng Xinghai said with a cough.

"I think my body is also gradually heating up," Qin Ming informed them, having a brand new experience.

Li Qingyun couldn't sit still. Qin Ming was experiencing two distinct unusual sensations one after another, a phenomenon he had never heard of before.
