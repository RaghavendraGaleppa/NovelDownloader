Chapter 189: Seven Treasures Wonderful Tree

The two Heavenly Kings shrouded in runes also made their move. One wielded a spear, and around his body, clanging sounds resonated as dozens of metallic spears appeared, encircling him like a phoenix spreading its plumes. Shhh! Shhh! Shhh! Every divine metal spear glowed, their tips incredibly brilliant, simultaneously aimed at the battlefield. This was the only half-step Dao Lord level Heavenly King, relying solely on his cultivation without the aid of other exotic treasures. The other, however, was somewhat peculiar; he unleashed a terrifying secret art, emitting a radiant golden light. As he chanted scriptures, it condensed into a page of paper that emerged in the void, seemingly bearing supreme mysteries.

All of them charged into the battlefield, their targets Zhou Tian and Saint Demon. Just moments ago, they had been enraged by Yuan Chi's arrogance, yet now they moved to aid him; such was the allure of self-interest. "This is human nature!" Yuan Chi laughed loudly. If things had continued as they were, he might very well have died at the hands of Zhou Tian and Saint Demon, but now, the disruptors had arrived! Zhou Tian and Saint Demon also noticed the anomaly and felt helpless. Indeed, as Yuan Chi said, this was human nature, and they could understand the actions of those individuals.

"Saint Demon, you hold them back, I'll play with him," Zhou Tian said to Saint Demon, as his right hand transformed into a thunderous tiger and his left into heavy water wings. Lightning surged through the heavy water, the tiger's roar shook the heavens as it bit into the black stone tablet, holding Yuan Chi in check. Saint Demon was already gravely wounded, so he was better suited to deal with the Heavenly Kings, while Zhou Tian alone could restrain Yuan Chi. "Alright!" Saint Demon was decisive, retreating without a moment's hesitation. Yuan Chi made no attempt to stop him; this was exactly what he wanted.

The Yin-Yang Diagram, the Giant Ape, the divine metal spears, the runic golden paper—these were all ultimate divine abilities of the various combatants, possessing peerless power, causing the void to wail. Saint Demon stood in the void, his robes stained blood-red with his own blood, Yuan Chi's, and even Zhou Tian's. Despite his severe injuries, he showed no fear. Facing so many formidable top-tier divine abilities, he remained utterly dauntless. A golden lotus blossomed beneath him, and he sat cross-legged upon it, runes pouring from his hands as he formed a hand seal. "Seven Treasures Wonderful Tree!"

Boom! Above Saint Demon's head, a golden glazed treasure tree, several feet tall, appeared. Seven golden branches extended, each distinct in shape, yet all imbued with Dao韵 (Dao charm/rhythm), subtly aligning with certain rules. At the end of each branch, a blurry small figure sat cross-legged, evolving various divine abilities. This was an inheritance he had gained from a certain lotus seed, though it was incomplete.

The Spear-Wielding Heavenly King attacked, all his spear tips unleashing divine radiance. These were chains of order, weaving through the void, seeking to strangle Saint Demon! Beams of light surged, and the void near the spear tips exploded, threatening to be pierced. The dozens of spears hovering around him all had dazzling tips, their supreme energy shaking the void, emitting sounds of wind and thunder, erupting with blinding brilliance and immense lethality. Boom! Saint Demon's glabella glowed, and a small figure leaped from the Seven Treasures Wonderful Tree. A wave of earthy yellow light appeared, then condensed into a wall before him, blocking all the spear tips. He used earth-attributed power to form this wall, trapping all the spears that pierced it.

Then another small figure leaped out, throwing a punch. The Blood Arhat reappeared, his entire being surging with terrifying Yin energy, like a black hole. The Giant Ape was blocked, holding a bronze staff, roaring to the sky as it became entangled in battle with the Arhat.

"Sever!" The Golden Paper Heavenly King struck. The golden paper enlarged, as if splitting heaven and earth into two halves, cleaving through all obstacles. It was merely a page of paper, yet it was as sharp as a heavenly blade. A single golden page, capable of severing heaven and earth. Boom! Boom! From the Seven Treasures Wonderful Tree, two small figures leaped out. One was wreathed in golden lightning, making the entire world roar; the other held a small sword, and even before it swung, its sharp aura tore through space. As the golden paper approached, Saint Demon clearly saw a single character on it—"Sever!" It seemed to be burning, emitting dazzling light as it contended with the two small figures.

Rumble! The sky roared, and a shadow enveloped Zhou Tian—the Yin-Yang Diagram of the Four Dragons of Heavenly Evolution had arrived. They had launched it earlier, but it arrived later only because the Yin-Yang Diagram was too terrifying, and even they could not fully control it. The last three small figures from the Seven Treasures Wonderful Tree leaped out together. Red flames swept across the sky, feet trampled the earth, and an immense Yin wind surged. These three divine abilities simultaneously erupted, resisting the Yin-Yang Diagram. For a moment, the scene reached a stalemate.

"The Seven Treasures Wonderful Tree… it seems they don't know whose nirvana ground this is, yet they've obtained its inheritance," Huang Qi murmured, his gaze deep as he stared at the glazed treasure tree above Saint Demon's head, which glowed with golden light, enveloping Saint Demon. When he arrived, he had read relevant records. The Seven Treasures Wonderful Tree was one of Wu Tian's strongest divine abilities back then: seven branches, seven divine abilities. Most terrifyingly, at its peak, all seven divine abilities could merge into one, unleashing an incredibly powerful strike. However, it was clear that Saint Demon had not received the complete inheritance; in its current state, it could only be considered a slightly stronger divine ability, not truly heaven-defying. This was also why Saint Demon hadn't used it when fighting Yuan Chi. This current situation was one he was pleased to see. He felt that Zhou Tian and Saint Demon had tricked him; Zhou Tian had used some method to deceive him, not taking an oath, while he himself had sworn not to intervene. He needed a variable, an opportunity to step in. A one-sided situation was not what he wanted. As long as someone else eventually obtained the World Origin, then he could enter the fray. The World Origin was not indivisible; in fact, it was extremely fragile. This was also why those few Heavenly Kings still harbored hope—even obtaining a tiny bit would be an immense fortuitous encounter.

Elsewhere, Zhou Tian and Yuan Chi were also locked in battle. "Boy, your Nine Provinces are already meat in my Abyss Tomb's mouth. Why struggle so fiercely? If you surrender now, I can grant you the same status within the Nine Provinces," Yuan Chi said to Zhou Tian, attempting to psychologically break him and make him collapse. "Surrender my ass!" Zhou Tian retorted mercilessly, while continuously punching. Each punch was accompanied by a unique energy, each strike by a Daoistic hum, as various phenomena erupted: dragon roars and tiger cries, successive bolts of startling thunder, and towering crimson flames. Bang! Bang! Yuan Chi was currently no match for Zhou Tian, as he had been severely wounded by the earlier pincer attack from both Zhou Tian and Saint Demon. Moreover, Zhou Tian had replicated Huang Qi's cultivation, making him slightly stronger than Yuan Chi. Punches landed repeatedly on Yuan Chi's body, each time causing him to vomit a large mouthful of blood. However, as a member of the Abyss Tomb clan, Yuan Chi possessed a special constitution; despite taking so many blows, he remained lively and robust.

Crack! A crisp tearing sound echoed between heaven and earth. Everyone's movements paused, their gazes turning towards the location of the World Origin.
