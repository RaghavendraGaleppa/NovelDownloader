## Chapter 44: The Ascension Decree

"An Ascension Decree?" Sitting by the window, Li Zhiming's eyes drifted out into the rain-soaked distance, lost in thought. Han Li extracted a thin piece of paper from the box, with only a few lines of writing: "Little Li, words are like a meeting. After four years, hold this 'Ascension Decree' and go to the Rotating Light Sect. There will be a powerful cultivator to guide you." 

This Ascension Decree was obtained from Yu Zichong after a fierce struggle with Mo Daren.

"The Rotating Light Sect..." Li Zhiming murmured, his mind drifting back to four years ago in Dongxiang, where a bone-reading ceremony had determined his fate as a mortal, while also revealing the predestined lives of countless others.

Li Zhiming slowly refocused his gaze on the ink-black desk, where a cup of fragrant tea, made from mountain silver needles, sat. The tea was something Mo Daren often enjoyed, and Li Zhiming had tried it when he was younger but lost interest. Now, under his master's guidance, he had started drinking it again.

His thoughts wandered to the "Immortal Lord" in Dongxiang, who had soared into the heavens. What kind of life had that little chubby boy led after going to the Rotating Light Sect? 

Li Zhiming knew not, but he imagined it to be a life vastly different from that of a mortal, full of turmoil and grandeur.

"What's the Rotating Light Sect like, Xiao Si?" Han Li asked, his face slightly tense.

As a child from the countryside, Han Li was unfamiliar with the outside world. He had never heard of the Rotating Light Sect before and was worried about the journey to Lanzhou, let alone the unknown dangers and tasks that lay ahead.

Li Zhiming took a sip of the tea, trying to sound mature, "You stay here and grow up well. The dangers in Lanzhou are not something you can handle now. When the person I sent out returns with news, if my master's family is safe, you don't need to rush off. If there's trouble, I'll go with you."

Li Zhiming then turned his attention to the map left by his master, which supposedly showed the path to the Rotating Light Sect. 

He located both Qixuan Gate and Lanzhou on the map, noting the vast distance between them. The journey seemed like a daunting task, even for someone as optimistic as Han Li.

The map indicated a place deep within the mountains, marked with complex characters that Li Zhiming could now read: "Rotating Light Sect".

The distance was staggering. From the map, it seemed like a tiny gap, but in reality, it was like traveling to another world.

Li Zhiming's excitement began to wane as he contemplated the enormity of the journey.

"Originally, it's that far," Li Zhiming said to himself, recalling the bone-reading ceremony. He had thought he was close to the Rotating Light Sect back then.

Now, holding the map, he realized that missing that opportunity might mean a lifetime of separation.

"Take it," Li Zhiming said to Han Li. "Though the Rotating Light Sect is far away, it's not your final destination."

Han Li looked worried, "Will you go with me?"

Li Zhiming chuckled, "You have a spiritual root, but I'm just a mortal. How could I go?"

Han Li didn't share Li Zhiming's optimism. He believed his own intelligence lay not in his spiritual root but in his companionship with Li Zhiming, who seemed to excel in every aspect.

As Li Zhiming turned his back to Han Li and walked to the door to gaze out at the rain, Han Li realized that his friend had indeed changed a lot since his master's passing.
