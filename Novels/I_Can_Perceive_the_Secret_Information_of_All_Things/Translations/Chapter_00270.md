# Chapter 270: News About Lu Zha and the Hidden Secret Realm of Divine Armory Valley  

The ghost cultivator Huangquan Zhenren countered with ghostly flames, attempting to weaken the power of the celestial fire with extreme cold. Yet, a four-stringed pipa left him utterly overwhelmed, forcing him into a passive defense.  

He naturally recognized the treasures on the Taoist priest, but he hadn’t expected there to be so many.  

Nine treasures were right before his eyes, yet Huangquan Zhenren harbored no greed—only the desperate urge to flee.  

But escape was impossible.  

With Xiao Ji’s execution of the *Inverse Immortal Technique*, Huangquan Zhenren’s dantian shattered, and he plummeted to the ground headfirst.  

Xiao Ji landed as well, sheathing his sword.  

Han Sandian shivered again.  

The strange sound effects were almost suggestive.  

Xiao Ji glanced toward the direction of the Yinshan Market. "A powerful underworld enforcer is coming. We need to leave."  

The underworld enforcer Zhong Li snapped out of her daze and said, "Taoist Priest, you may go in peace. I’ll handle the newcomer. Once you pass the canyon entrance you obliterated earlier, you’ll go through two more cities..."  

"This humble priest has divined that your contributions won’t be stolen this time," Xiao Ji said.  

"Did you actually perform any divination just now?" Han Sandian questioned.  

"The formality isn’t important," Xiao Ji replied.  

After a brief exchange, Xiao Ji and Han Sandian departed. Another two hundred li, and he would use the *Yin-Yang Boat* to return to the mortal realm. According to his senses, they were still within the search radius of Zhuxian Town and needed to go further.  

The travel pass in his hand wasn’t particularly useful, but Xiao Ji had insisted on obtaining one in case he ever returned to the underworld—it would make things easier.  

Zhong Li watched the Taoist priest leave, her eyes filled with gratitude.  

The priest had essentially handed her a rare opportunity for promotion and a salary increase. It was impossible not to feel thankful.  

*If one day the Taoist priest dies and arrives in the underworld, I’ll make sure he’s protected and reincarnates into a good life,* Zhong Li silently vowed.  

Given her current abilities, that was all she could promise.  

Xiao Ji had already traveled some distance when he frowned and glanced back. He wasn’t sure whether Zhong Li’s words counted as a curse or just well-meaning sentiment.  

Once they reached a safe area, Xiao Ji summoned the *Yin-Yang Boat* and returned to the mortal realm with the former Spear Immortal, Han Sandian.  

They emerged near a cluster of hills, hundreds of li from Zhuxian Town—well beyond the demon horde’s search range.  

"This place is safe. Fellow Daoist Han, we part ways here," Xiao Ji said, summoning his flying sword and stepping onto it.  

"In my prime, I could ride my spear through the skies. Now, even walking is a struggle..." Han Sandian sighed, eyeing Xiao Ji’s flying sword and then his own spear. After a pause, he added, "Fellow Daoist Xiao, would you really abandon me to die in demon territory? A good deed should be carried through to the end. Help me a little further, and if I ever regain my former strength, I’ll repay you generously."  

Xiao Ji considered it. Indeed, the once-great Spear Immortal was now just an ordinary man. He had overlooked that.

**Yuanshen Temple, Main Hall**  

"This gentleman will be staying at our Yuanshen Temple for the time being. His name is Han Sandian, a spearman," Xiao Ji introduced the new arrival to the temple’s residents. "He was once formidable but is now in recovery."  

"Brother Sandian, could you be the Spear Immortal Han Sandian who was imprisoned in Zhuxian Town?" Wang Yaoda, once the Peacock King, was familiar with Zhuxian Town’s affairs and recognized the name.  

"You’ve heard of me?" Han Sandian was visibly excited.  

"Only in passing," Wang Yaoda replied modestly. "The oar used to suppress you was originally mine before the Demon King stole it. In a way, I bear some responsibility for your plight."  

The two actually had a connection.  

"What’s the story?" Ying Xiao had already pulled out her notebook, eager to record.  

Xiao Ji was used to the fallen third princess’s habits—she never missed a good story. What puzzled him was his master’s lack of creative inspiration despite Han Sandian’s fascinating tale.  

Looking at his master, Xiao Ji felt a pang of emotion.  

Liu Haizhu was already asleep on his meditation cushion, looking even younger than before. His memory, however, had deteriorated further.  

After introductions, Han Sandian officially moved into Yuanshen Temple, securing his own quarters.  

Why had he chosen to stay here?  

When Han Sandian had asked Xiao Ji to escort him out of demon territory, Xiao Ji had planned to leave him at a safe human settlement with some funds and advice—perhaps buying land to farm, marrying a wife, or, if he preferred the martial life, performing street shows once his legs recovered.  

But Han Sandian rejected all suggestions. His dream was to regain his former strength as the Spear Immortal.  

After all, having once scaled towering peaks, how could one settle for small hills?  

In the end, Han Sandian proposed staying at Yuanshen Temple. To him, the temple was a mysterious and powerful place—if a disciple like Xiao Ji could possess such abilities, the master must be even more formidable. Staying among the strong would surely aid his recovery.  

If even the disciple could claim three of the *Nine Cosmic Treasures*, the master was undoubtedly extraordinary.  

At first glance, Han Sandian knew he had made the right choice. The temple master was enigmatic—rumored to have transformed from an old man to a youth overnight. Such a feat suggested mastery of longevity techniques.  

Xiao Ji didn’t object to Han Sandian staying. Yuanshen Temple welcomed all virtuous souls in dire straits. As a former Spear Immortal, Han Sandian’s character was beyond reproach—he had fought demons and even challenged the Demon King.  

Regardless of his current state, he had once been a true immortal—not just in title, but in reality.  

In the following days, Xiao Ji refurbished the temple, strengthening its defenses and assessing its progress toward becoming a secret realm—still a long way to go.  

Yuanshen Temple was growing livelier, but Xiao Ji noticed that many of their guests, though once illustrious, were now shadows of their former selves.  

The Peacock King, the Spear Immortal, the fallen Third Princess of Dali—their titles were impressive, but their current states were far from ideal.  

Xiao Ji believed things would improve. Lin Musheng was proof—the new lord of Lin Fort was thriving in the mortal world, sending local delicacies to the temple every holiday.  

But how far away was the future? Only time would tell.  

Days passed peacefully at the temple. Devotees still came, though increasingly, they were elderly folks who treated the place like a park—some even tying ropes to ancient trees and swinging from them.  

Ying Xiao had unwittingly turned the temple into a senior exercise ground.  

Wang Yaoda, as usual, stood motionless in the courtyard, displaying his peacock form. A few stubborn old men watched him intently, waiting for the bird to move.  

Xiao Ji had advised them not to waste their remaining years in a battle of wills with an animal, but to no avail. The last time he counted, a few had already stopped coming.  

After a period of calm, Xiao Ji prepared to leave again. His first stop: Taigu City.  

---  

**Taigu City**  

The first level of Taigu City was crowded with cultivators, including Xiao Ji’s shop, *Xianpin Hui*.  

However, Nascent Soul cultivators were barred from entering and had to use avatars in designated areas on the second level.  

The second level catered to Nascent Soul and Divine Transformation cultivators, though few frequented it. Aside from Taigu City’s staff, Xiao Ji rarely encountered fellow cultivators there.  

Through his perception, he knew many were secluded in caves or buildings, meditating for years.  

City Lord Sanyun Daxian, a Divine Transformation veteran, had designed specialized cultivation spaces for high-level practitioners, offering them free accommodations (excluding rare pills and artifacts).  

Sanyun Daxian’s management skills had attracted many powerful cultivators, ensuring Taigu City’s safety—no demon hordes or rogue sects dared attack.  

Using an avatar, Xiao Ji visited *Xianpin Hui*, encouraged Pei Yisheng, and then headed to his usual haunt: Gossip Square, to catch up on cultivation world news.  

**Gossip Square**  

Xiao Ji found numerous reports about Lu Zha:  

- "The Secretless Sect’s First Visit to Fuyao Sect’s Natural Dao Seed, Lu Zha..."  
- "Lu Zha’s First Account of His First Time..."  
- "Lu Zha Proposes Three Suggestions, Two Principles, and One Direction for the Cultivation World..."  
- "What Lu Zha Eats Every Day..."  

Suddenly, Lu Zha was everywhere—no longer in vague rumors but detailed accounts, even down to his daily meals.  

Xiao Ji found the menu excessive, but the cultivation world took it seriously. As a Natural Dao Seed, Lu Zha’s diet was believed to hold secrets, prompting many sects to revise their meal plans accordingly.  

Then Xiao Ji spotted a familiar face—Lu Yu, who immediately approached with a smile.  

"Taoist Priest Xiao! You’re in Taigu City!" she exclaimed. "I’ve been waiting here for days, knowing you’d come."  

Xiao Ji had indeed left contact information during their meeting in the East Sea.  

"Fate brings us together," Xiao Ji said politely.  

"Your recommendation letter worked wonders!" Lu Yu gushed. "Fuyao Sect wouldn’t even let me in until I showed it. Lu Zha himself received me! He said his master won’t let him leave the mountain now, but he’ll visit Yangliu Town to see you when he can..."  

Now Xiao Ji understood the flood of Lu Zha news—Lu Yu’s doing.  

The Secretless Sect was thriving, likely profiting handsomely.  

Though Xiao Ji wasn’t fond of gossipmongers, they served a purpose. Since he couldn’t change the industry, he might as well leverage it. Having a famous gossip like Lu Yu as an ally could be useful.  

After chatting, Xiao Ji learned more about Lu Zha. The boy had grown into a young man, his cultivation level undisclosed—though if he had any breakthroughs, he might ascend to immortality in one step.  

Since he had a gossip source, Xiao Ji inquired about recent *Nine Treasures* developments.  

Lu Yu mentioned a secret realm—though details were still unconfirmed, so no official report had been released.  

The Secretless Sect valued accuracy, only publishing verified information after rigorous checks.  

For Xiao Ji, Lu Yu shared what she knew:  

The realm was called the *Hundred Arms Secret Realm*, located in the ancient Divine Armory Valley. A wandering artifact-refining cultivator had discovered it while searching for spirit iron veins. When he returned with friends, it had vanished.  

According to him, he had followed the aftermath of a battle between two powerful figures, hoping to scavenge dropped artifacts. The combatants had entered a mysterious valley near an ancient stone tablet inscribed:  

**"Hundred Arms Secret Realm—Beware Danger—Do Not Enter."**  

He felt overwhelming pressure at the entrance and retreated, marking the path for later.
