Chapter 40: Renowned Across the Lands

“Skills never weigh one down; it’s good to learn more. At critical moments, they can save your life, and you, young man, learn things exceptionally fast.” Old Man Liu approved greatly, yet he sighed. In such a remote region, ancient lineages with significant backgrounds were incredibly rare.

The most crucial thing was that even if they had fallen into decline, they still adhered to ancestral teachings and would not easily show their family’s hidden texts to outsiders.

“I’ll find someone to ask about it later,” Old Man Liu promised.

Qin Ming was overjoyed. If he could encounter another ancient secret manual containing the crystallized wisdom of predecessors, his gains would undoubtedly be immense. He felt hopeful; while declining lineages had their own persistence, not everyone would cling to the old ways.

“Old Master, how is your body?” Qin Ming asked with concern.

Old Man Liu had strived for half his life, only to obtain the red herb imbued with rich spiritual essence from the Fire Bat Cave, when he was targeted by the people from Golden Rooster Ridge and stealthily struck with a Yellow Earth Palm.

He sighed, “It won’t take my old life. The injuries can be nursed, but as for a second rejuvenation, I can no longer control it. I’ll just leave it to fate.”

Qin Ming returned home, deboned the meat from a fire snake, placed it on an iron plate, and then picked up his long-handled Dark Gold Hammer to thoroughly pound it into a paste.

“There shouldn’t be any human blood smell, right? I’ve washed the Dark Gold Hammer twice.”

Half an hour later, Qin Ming arrived at Old Man Liu’s house again with a pot of meat porridge. “This is from a small spiritual creature I hunted in the mountains. While it can’t help with rebirth, it’s a tonic. It’s cold in nature, which can perfectly counteract the hot nature of the red herb.”

Old Man Liu was suspicious but accepted it. “You’re a thoughtful lad.”

The next day, just as night fell, Old Man Liu knocked on the courtyard gate. Upon seeing Qin Ming, he grabbed his hand and exclaimed, “Little Qin, what did you feed me?”

Fire snakes were like entirely different creatures compared to ordinary snakes; their meat tasted completely different. Even Old Man Liu didn't know what he had eaten, but he felt entirely better, no longer sickly.

“Old Man, I feel like with this body of mine now, I could father another son in my old age!”

***

That day, everyone noticed Old Man Liu was full of vigor, his voice considerably louder and clearer.

“Black and White Mountain has become renowned everywhere this time. Many splendid cities are discussing it. The ten-colored light pillar tore through the night sky, truly shocking the world!”

While searching for special nodes in the mountains, Cao Long, Mu Qing, Wei Zhirou, and others were conversing. Their information was extremely well-informed, as they used raptors to exchange letters with the outside world.

Qin Ming immediately perked up and listened intently. He was very interested in the mysterious byproducts related to the phenomenon and also wanted to learn about the outside world.

“Many large organizations are full of regrets for not having paid enough attention to this place. After assessing the most mysterious resource this time, they believe it to be a divine gift from heaven, truly priceless. Even some ancient sects that were in a state of isolation have been alarmed, taking it very seriously and dispatching people to learn the details.”

Overnight, Black and White Mountain, which had been silent for years, became the focus of heated discussions everywhere.

“Two hundred years ago, when the heavenly light pierced Black and White Mountain, some of the experts who rushed from the royal capital are still alive! It’s said that an old fellow was so enraged that he didn’t close his eyes for two days and two nights, finally running off into the deep mountains and vast marshes with bloodshot eyes, intending to hunt down that legendary Six-Tusked White Elephant.”

“The Six-Tusked White Elephant? Isn’t that the mount of a deity worshipped by a certain secret sect? Even if it exists in reality, it must be in the world in the deepest part of the night mist.”

Qin Ming listened with great interest. He yearned for the vast and boundless world outside. Just hearing a few snippets, he felt it was vibrant and colorful, making him want to leave this remote place and see it for himself.

“Not just the royal capital, there are rumors that even high-level figures in the incomparably mighty Imperial City of the distant Yu Kingdom were alerted. The Imperial Preceptor personally inquired about this matter, after all, the simultaneous appearance and merging of the ten-colored light pillar and the five-colored mist are unrecorded in any literature.”

Although some coveted that mysterious resource, they ultimately couldn't trace it further because they encountered powerful obstruction; extraordinary figures of extremely high status had intervened.

“Those blessed lands, and the spiritual mountains imbued with heavenly light, this time were believed…”

Qin Ming really wanted to urge them to say more, but alas, while their relationship was decent, it wasn't yet close enough. He was well aware of his place and did not say much.

After finding no results in their search for special nodes that day, Xu Yueping consulted with Old Man Liu, proposing to take three teams to the Flying Sickle Bird's nest.

Xu Yueping frankly admitted that it was uncertain whether there were spiritual substances there, but it was indeed a good place to temper the newly awakened ones. He was devoted and responsible towards the village and wanted to ask Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and Mu Qing to eliminate the pests.

The reason for the grain shortage this winter was largely due to the Flying Sickle Birds. Before the autumn harvest, they would fly out from the mountains, sweep over the fire fields, and with their sickle-like beaks, a single swoop would leave several clusters of grain stalks bare.

Wei Zhirou nodded, "The original mountain sweeping operation was to clear out various harmful beasts. Since there are such vicious birds, we should go and check it out."

Xu Yueping was immediately exceedingly grateful. Everyone knew that the mountain sweeping was just a pretext; finding the special resources in the mountains was the real goal.

Cao Long said, “This group of youths, newly awakened this year, have only had a taste of blood in the Fire Bat Cave. They haven’t had any proper tempering yet, and the Flying Sickle Birds are very suitable.”

Soon after, they arrived at a low cliff. There was a large amount of bird droppings on the snowy ground, and the cliff face had many crevices where the Flying Sickle Birds nested.

Mu Qing, Cao Long, and the others were very professional and well-prepared, even bringing nets woven from metal wire. Over a dozen large nets were cast, covering the densest areas of the bird nests.

Even so, a large number of Flying Sickle Birds still soared up, dense and numerous. At least a thousand birds escaped the nets, truly a plague. They were about a foot long, with particularly large and sharp beaks, and were very fierce. After their nests were attacked and covered, they all charged forward fearlessly.

Fortunately, everyone was wearing armor. When the Flying Sickle Birds swooped down in swarms and flocks, even if some broke through to reach them, they could be defended against. Qin Ming, Xu Yueping, and the others were no exception; in the past few days, they had been guiding the three teams in the mountains and had each been given a set of armor.

Eventually, a large number of Flying Sickle Birds were killed, especially more so in the nests covered by the nets. After clearing those on the cliff, a layer of bird corpses accumulated on the ground. Many fierce birds still flew away, but most were dealt with, and their nests were completely disrupted. They wouldn't dare to return for a while, and with their numbers reduced, villagers would also dare to hunt them.

The Black Sheep Knight, Yang Yongqing, was tasked with notifying the villagers to bring sacks and collect the bird corpses. It would be a waste to discard so much meat.

Over these few days, Qin Ming had been carefully observing the various groups of people in the mountains, but he still hadn't found the individuals he was looking for.

“Those two were in their early thirties; the woman had a mole in her right eyebrow, and the man had unusually long arms. Unfortunately, there's no one who matches them.”

Back then, those two had rescued him from the Feathered Robe Youth, led him away from the city, brought him to this remote place, and after leaving him in Silver Vine Town, they had explored Black and White Mountain. Yet, they hadn't appeared this time.

During this period, Qin Ming fulfilled his promise, contacting the Old Noble’s people multiple times to inform them of what he had seen in the mountains and which organizations had obtained particularly special resources.

The Old Noble, Xie Jingrui, sighed, as nothing he needed had appeared.

Today, he personally entered the mountain, and remarkably, he went directly into the deepest part of the mountain, which deeply shocked and stirred many old fellows from Crimson Mist City.

Ever since Ling Xu and the Tabby Cat left, no one dared to venture deep. In the mountains, not to mention that mysterious Mountain Master, even the old weasel, about a foot long, was terrifying when it went mad, running all over the mountains with a donkey in its grasp. After being intercepted and having its prey snatched away by the green-clothed woman, its mentality was clearly unbalanced. Who would dare to seek trouble?

Half a day later, the Old Noble Xie Jingrui emerged silently, delicately holding two very short plant roots, one black and one white, in his hand.

He sighed softly, “As expected, roots and stems of the Black and White Tree still remain deep in the mountains. Nurtured by heavenly light, they transformed into extraordinary mysterious resources!”

Qin Ming was acting alone, searching for special nodes. Seeing Xie Jingrui approach, he asked, “Did you find what you were looking for?”

“I found something, but someone got there first,” Xie Jingrui said, standing in the forest with some helplessness. He sighed, “It’s a pity I’m injured and cannot fight for long in chaos, otherwise I would have gone deeper into the mountains earlier.”

“Were there no clues left behind?” Qin Ming realized that the roots of the Black and White Tree, nurtured by heavenly light, were very important to the Old Noble. He had come two years ago just to obtain them.

Xie Jingrui said, “I know who took it. I’ll have to make a trip to Crimson Mist City.”

“It wouldn’t be City Lord Ling Xu, would it?” Qin Ming asked.

The Old Noble nodded. He had asked Wei Mo, who followed the Juling Shen path, in the deep mountains, and the latter informed him that Ling Xu had lingered there for a long time.

Xie Jingrui said, “No wonder Ling Xu ran straight back to Crimson Mist City after missing out on the strongest mysterious resource. Everyone said he was so angry he almost slapped his thigh off, regretting not buying a flying mount. In reality, he was afraid others would know of his other great gains. He took this opportunity to escape. What a rogue! And ‘elegant and scholarly in white robes’? I think he should change to black robes.”

Qin Ming was speechless for a moment. He was also curious why the Old Noble spoke so much to him before leaving.

Soon, he understood the answer. Xie Jingrui said, “That Purple-Eyed Crow thinks very highly of you. Work hard; this place is too remote and isolated. Get out of here early.”

He was about to leave Silver Vine Town and would depart immediately after exiting the mountains.

“Miss Xie will also be leaving with you, right?”

“Yes, until we meet again by fate!” The Old Noble Xie Jingrui flickered and vanished directly from the forest, moving at an unbelievably fast speed.

From afar, a loud commotion was heard. When Qin Ming rushed over, he found a group of nobles in splendid clothes on spirited steeds confronting Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and Mu Qing.

The various powerful families of Crimson Mist City were not a harmonious group. While the Cao, Wei, and Mu families banded together, other major families naturally formed their own groups to enter the mountain.

Just now, someone had exchanged blows with Cao Long, but was defeated rather quickly, sent flying by a strike, which greatly astonished everyone.

At this moment, a young man in golden armor, riding a mutated golden leopard, approached, exuding a powerful aura.

Cao Long coldly said, “Feng Xing, don’t cause trouble. That old fellow from the Wang family tried to snatch my Seventh Uncle’s Lifespan-Extending Tree and was repelled by me. Is there a problem? Are you standing up for the Wang family?”

Feng Xing, the youth on the golden leopard, spoke indifferently, “Two years unseen. I heard your strength has surged significantly. We’ve always fought along the way; let’s have a spar now.”

“Aren’t you just looking for a fight? Do you think I’m afraid of you?”

The surrounding people also came from Crimson Mist City and knew each other. Although they were mainly divided into two groups, there were also neutral nobles, and someone spoke up to mediate.

“Elder Brother Feng Xing, Elder Brother Cao Long, both of you are prominent figures from Crimson Mist City who have made names in the major cities. Don’t harm the harmony. Your strength is so high now; if you accidentally lose control, the consequences will be unpredictable.”

In such circumstances, anyone daring to boldly step forward to mediate naturally came from a notable background. The one who spoke was a young man, riding a white rhinoceros. He approached from a distance, arriving in the dense forest. He was very handsome, and his silver armor made him look exceptionally valiant and truly extraordinary.

Beside him was a young woman riding a black tiger. She had a graceful figure and wore purple-gold armor. Her eyebrows were curved, and her large eyes were bright, making her very radiant and captivating. Many young men couldn't help but glance at her multiple times upon her arrival.

After this exceptionally outstanding pair of young man and woman appeared, many people greeted them enthusiastically. Even those older than them treated the two with great courtesy. Behind this pair of outstanding young man and woman, a large group of people also followed, surrounding the two like stars surrounding the moon, with them at the center.

From the quiet conversations of the crowd, Qin Ming learned why the two were so eye-catching. When they became newly awakened ones this year, they caused a sensation in Crimson Mist City, being the most dazzling and stunning in the entire region for twenty years. Those who had laid a golden foundation in recent years were far inferior to them.

Indeed, after the young man spoke, Feng Xing showed respect, putting away his weapon and exchanging a few words with him, smiling.

“Who is Qin Ming?” Nie Rui, the silver-armored youth riding the white rhinoceros, spoke, handsome and radiant, searching through the crowd.

Qin Ming frowned. How did he know about him?

Nie Rui chuckled, “I visited Master Xu Kong, and during my visit, I wanted to spar with his disciple. However, Zhou Wubing said he was unwell and it was inconvenient to fight, but he highly praised you, saying you were stronger than him. I’m truly curious: is there a youth here more formidable than Master Xu Kong’s personally taught disciple? So I came to take a look.”

Qin Ming was stunned. “That Wubing, he’s truly ill!”
