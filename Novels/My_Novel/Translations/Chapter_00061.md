Chapter 61: Capturing the Immortal in the Jar, The Divine Catcher's Daughter

The moonlight flowed like water, pouring over the earth.

There stood a woman dressed in a green skirt, looking bright and charming, yet her expression carried an air of pride. A long sword hung at her waist, its sheath a tangerine color inlaid with jade and other stones. Her appearance and demeanor were flawless, and the white horse beneath her was spirited and extraordinary.

"They are from the manor," someone said.

Li Xian remained calm and composed, taking a step forward to respond directly.

The woman raised her eyebrows slightly, scanning him up and down, thinking to herself, "This fellow is quite handsome."

She said coldly, "I have business to discuss with the mistress of your manor. Go notify her."

Her tone was commanding.

Li Xian cupped his hands in salute. "Might this hero first reveal her name?"

The woman said coldly, "If I do not give my name, will you not announce me?"

"Even without a name, I would still announce you," Li Xian said calmly. "However, if I have a name to report, the Mistress will likely arrive more quickly."

"You little servant, you aren't looking down on me with dog eyes. Otherwise, this auntie would whip you across the face," the woman scoffed proudly. "This auntie is named Li Haitang. Announce me quickly."

"Alright!"

Li Xian hurried back to the manor, his mind racing.

"This woman is likely a martial artist from the Jianghu. She seems to have quite a temper. It is late at night and quiet; I wonder what business she has with the Mistress."

After seeing Pang Long, he briefly explained the situation. Pang Long did not dare to neglect it and immediately went to report to the Mistress.

The Mistress only replied with a "Hmm." Pang Long understood and took Li Xian out of the manor to receive Li Haitang again.

"Miss Haitang, the Mistress is currently resting. Please enter the manor and sit for a moment, wait a little while," Pang Long said with a friendly attitude.

Li Haitang frowned but said nothing, following him into the manor. It was already late at night, and aside from the patrolling guards, there were no other figures to be seen.

"Li Xian, you are about her age, stay by her side and entertain her," Pang Long said, patting Li Xian on the shoulder.

The underlying intention was that since Li Xian was handsome and the Mistress's arrival time was unknown, if the young woman were to throw a tantrum in the meantime, Li Xian would be there to placate her.

"Understood."

Li Xian nodded.

The "Welcome Hall" was decorated luxuriously. Two welcoming pines were vigorous and ancient, and incense burned constantly in the room.

"I have long heard that the Mistress has many friends in the Jianghu. Every time a guest visits, they are received in this hall."

"This is my first time here; the规格 (specifications/scale) is indeed intimidating."

The floor was paved with jade. Outside, it was freezing with snow, but inside, it was as warm as spring. The scenery was beautiful, not needing much description. Outside the hall was a goldfish pond where the goldfish played in the water. From a distance, it looked as if golden light was flowing.

Li Xian, who lived in the manor for a long time, was greatly surprised. In contrast, Li Haitang, who was new here, seemed accustomed to it all.

"When will your Mistress come to see me?" Li Haitang asked. "Is she going to make me wait all night?"

"I do not dare to speculate on the Mistress's affairs," Li Xian said, though he thought to himself, she probably will have to wait all night. Although Li Haitang's clothing was not bad, she was very young and might not have much reputation in the Jianghu. She probably wasn't worth the Mistress receiving her overnight.

Instead, Li Xian's schedule was disrupted. He wouldn't be able to sleep tonight and could only keep her company, enduring a night of suffering here.

Pang Long also didn't dare to sleep and frequently came over to observe.

An hour passed.

Li Haitang's temper flared. Ignoring everything, she angrily said, "Your Mistress is really putting on airs! If she wants to see me, she sees me; if not, she doesn't. Leaving me here like this and making a subordinate keep me company—what is the meaning of this!"

She picked up a teacup, ready to smash it. However, at that moment, she had a change of heart. She was here to ask for help and needed to restrain her temper to succeed.

So she sat back down and drank her tea.

Li Xian thought to himself, "This woman has a fierce temper. Her family background must be extraordinary; otherwise, she would have been beaten to death long ago."

As dawn was about to break, Madam Wen and Pang Long walked over slowly.

Li Haitang muttered, "Finally here. Let me see what kind of person you are." She stood up and looked, meeting Madam Wen face to face.

"Please sit."

Madam Wen sat in the main seat. Her tone was gentle, her demeanor dignified. Combined with her flawless looks and rich experience, she instantly overshadowed Li Haitang.

Li Haitang saw that this Madam was not as domineering and arrogant as she had imagined. Recalling the purpose of her visit, her temper faded significantly. "Madam, hello!"

"Last night, my subordinates were afraid of disturbing my rest and didn't dare to make a sound. I woke up in the morning and hurried over," Madam Wen said. She dipped her delicate hand in tea, poured in some cold water, and then gently tapped the teacup.

The teacup flew sideways. Li Haitang reached out and caught it, feeling her palm slightly scalded. She opened it and saw the tea aroma overflowing. The cold water from earlier had become boiling hot.

"Excellent skill!" Li Haitang said直言 (frankly). The frustration from last night dissipated. She took a sip of tea and cupped her hands, saying, "It seems the rumors are true. There is a martial artist living in this manor!"

"May I ask for the Madam's name?" Li Haitang asked.

This casual question was one that even Pang Long did not have the资格 (qualification) to ask.

Madam Wen smiled. "My surname is Wen, given name Caitang."

"Wen Caitang... Madam Wen... So it is you!" Li Haitang said. "My father has mentioned you."

"You are the daughter of the Divine Catcher, Li Bohou," Madam Wen said.

"That is correct," Li Haitang said, now filled with respect.

Although her background was impressive and her talent was good, when she came to someone else's territory, even a strong dragon must lower its head, let alone a young dragon. Moreover, the person before her was a martial artist already famous in the Jianghu.

"Tell me directly why you are looking for me. If possible, considering your father's face, I will help you," Madam Wen said.

Hearing these words, Li Haitang flashed a hint of displeasure but did not show it. She said, "It is like this. I am currently pursuing a criminal."

"So it is catching thieves and capturing criminals," Madam Wen nodded. "What kind of criminal has left the daughter of Bohou helpless?"

Li Haitang said, "The criminal is named 'The Immortal in the Jar.' I suppose you have heard of him."

"This man is cruel in nature, short in stature, and carries a stone jar on his back. He practices a demonic technique and harms living creatures. He puts innocent commoners into an evil jar, and within three days, they turn into blood water, which he drinks to increase his strength."

"If this is not stopped, this thief will inevitably become a great disaster. However, his strength is formidable. In several confrontations, he managed to escape. We lack sufficient manpower and heard that you were nearby. So I came to ask for your help, hoping to receive some assistance."

Li Haitang explained the origin of the matter.

"So it is a Jianghu capture," Li Xian thought. "Putting people in jars and melting them into blood water. This is the first time I've heard of such a strange thing."

Madam Wen said, "What kind of help do you want?"

She naturally would not personally catch the thief for a junior. However, if the Immortal in the Jar could be eliminated early, it would be for the best. If he continued to cause harm, he would eventually threaten her assets, and she would have to take action herself.

"I wonder if there are any agile experts in the Madam's manor."

"They don't need deep strength, just light feet and sufficient intelligence. I will teach them a formation, and with our coordination, we can make the Immortal in the Jar have nowhere to escape," Li Haitang asked.

Madam Wen remained silent.

Li Haitang gritted her teeth. "Thirty people will do."

"Then thirty people," Madam Wen said, waving her hand grandly and turning to look at Pang Long. "Whom to choose is up to you."

With that, Pang Long selected three "Class B," six "Class C," and twenty-one "Class D," totaling exactly thirty people.

The Class B leaders would lead small teams to配合 (coordinate) with Li Haitang and the others to capture the Immortal in the Jar.

Pang Long had no specific candidates in mind. When the Mistress gave an order, he never held back and had no selfish motives. He saw that Li Xian was very clever and had escaped dangerous situations several times. This operation was a good opportunity to perform, so he let him lead a team to help capture the "Immortal in the Jar."

"Commander Pang, what are the chances of success for this matter?" Li Xian asked.

"The chances of success are about six or seven out of ten. There will definitely be casualties, but they won't be too heavy," Pang Long estimated. "That Immortal in the Jar is at the 'Food Essence' realm. The Mistress said that although he is厉害 (formidable), with enough manpower, we can control him."

Li Xian thought to himself:

"As a guard, I rarely have freedom. Whether I go or not is not up to my will."

"Since the outcome cannot be changed, perhaps it is not bad to take this opportunity to see the vastness of the Jianghu. But I must pay extra attention to safety!"

He knew this trip would definitely be dangerous, but Li Haitang was also a martial artist who had undergone a transformation. He heard she had other companions, so the risk was still controllable.
