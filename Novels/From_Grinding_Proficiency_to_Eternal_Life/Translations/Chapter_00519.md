# Chapter 519: Eight Scenery Cloud Qi

The Yuan Origin Sect's true person indeed possessed great wisdom, actually conceiving such a shameless method that left the Heavenly Dao powerless against it.

Truly, learning and seeing more is never wrong.

The people of Yuan Origin Sect always bring new tricks to Xu Yunfan.

In an instant, the power of the earth drawn by the earth's veins perfectly neutralized the pure "Heavenly Tribulation" and "Earthly Tribulation" descended by the laws of heaven and earth.

The tribulations of heaven and earth, due to the characteristics of the cultivation method and the advantage of the terrain, actually became an aid for Chu Chengnan to condense his Dao Fruit. They were swept away by the vast Xuanhuang turbid qi and dissipated without a trace.

However, the Heavenly Dao is clear and just; how could a tribulation be allowed to pass easily?

Although the first two tribulations were broken, the most dangerous and unpredictable "Human Tribulation" silently erupted, its killing intent even more intense than that of heaven and earth.

In short, where there are people, there is a Jianghu.

The obscure killing intent in the heavens and earth began to rapidly rise, merging into the hearts of countless people.

"He's drawing upon his Dao Fruit! The will of a thousand mountains and ten thousand peaks is empowering him... Who would have thought such a person was hidden under Lord Qingyuan Zhenjun! We cannot let him succeed!"

A cold voice, carrying a sharpness that could sever all things, seemed to arrive from across space.

"Stop his Dao Fruit!"

*Swoosh!*

A sword light suddenly lit up the horizon.

A pure, ultimate sword intent, carrying the will to obliterate all methods and sever karma, permeated the hearts of all who looked upon this sword light.

This sword qi did not originate from the Cold Crow Pass battlefield, but arrived in an instant from the direction of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, from a distance of countless miles.

Wherever the sword light passed, the air roared, and mountains and rivers were split open by a straight, deep fissure.

This sword's target was extremely clear: to sever the Xuanhuang qi pillar that connected the myriad earth veins and drew down the Dao Fruit.

Even more so, to sever the fragile connection being established between Chu Chengnan and the Dao Fruit.

The "Immovable Mysterious Mountain" Dao Fruit deep within the earth's veins had already bestowed its favor and was slowly descending towards Chu Chengnan. This sword light naturally would not have its way.

The owner of the sword light was hidden in an immeasurably distant place, but that pure, ultimate sword intent and the will to cut through all things were similar to what Xu Yunfan had felt in the memory of the Pure Yang Patriarch's "One Sword, No Return" within Wukong's memories.

Though not as earth-shattering, its core Dao rhythm was of the same origin.

It was another Foundation Establishment True Person from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect出手.

Although the Zhenjun was attracted by the Great War in the Eastern Wasteland, he had not completely ignored the sudden appearance of such a powerful Dao Fruit fluctuation in the borderlands.

However, it seemed that out of consideration for the other Zhenjuns of the Yuan Origin Sect who were holding back, the power level was controlled to be at the Foundation Establishment realm.

But it seemed, also a bit beyond the norm.

Xu Yunfan's expression was grave, and he pondered that a Zhenjun might have secretly added some force.

Suddenly, his expression shifted, and he looked towards the Western Continent.

At this time, Chu Chengnan, who was focused on the sword arriving from the south, also sensed it, a cold sneer appearing on his face.

"Hmph, the Western Heaven's evil baldies also want to intervene?!"

Almost at the same time the causal sword from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect was slashed out, the void at the edge of the Eastern Wasteland battlefield in another direction suddenly trembled.

A gentle golden light, carrying countless tiny Sanskrit characters, suddenly condensed, transforming into a huge, withered Buddha's palm seal flowing with the aura of "Nirvana" and "Return to Transformation." It carried a will to forcibly convert and extinguish all things, and remotely slapped towards the core of the condensing Dao Fruit.

This was clearly the power of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land.

They had also discovered the anomaly here and instantly judged that if the Yuan Origin Sect added another powerful Zhenjun, it would deal a devastating blow to their plans for spreading Buddhism in the Eastern Wasteland.

Even if it might anger the Zhenjuns of the Yuan Origin Sect, they absolutely could not let Chu Chengnan succeed.

This finger was not a physical attack, but one pointed out remotely by the Great Awakening Bodhisattva, containing the origin power of the Nirvana Red Lotus Dao Fruit. It targeted Chu Chengnan's spiritual foundation directly, aiming to ignite his Dao Heart and extinguish his will to achieve the Dao.

The angle was extremely cunning, and the timing was even more sinister.

Xu Yunfan's expression changed. A Golden Core Zhenjun had出手; he naturally would not take it on lightly.

Turning to run was the right path.

Two terrifying attacks, each capable of destroying a Foundation Establishment True Person, came from the left and right, almost simultaneously crossing endless space to kill their way to Cold Crow Pass.

Chu Chengnan, at the core of the ritual, was at the most critical and fragile moment of connecting with the Dao Fruit.

He was fully immersed in the感应 of the heavenly and earthly Dao laws, completely unable to spare any attention.

If these two attacks hit, the ritual would definitely be broken. At best, his efforts would be in vain and his Dao Foundation would be shattered; at worst, he would be annihilated on the spot, body and soul destroyed.

Just as Xu Yunfan was preparing to leave, Chu Chengnan suddenly sent a voice transmission.

"Junior Brother, you just need to block that sword intent. As for the Bodhisattva's attack, a Zhenjun from my Yuan Origin Sect will naturally stop it."

Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan's expression fluctuated uncertainly. In the end, he gritted his teeth. If what Chu Chengnan said was true, and he just turned and ran, he probably wouldn't be able to stay in the Yuan Origin Sect afterward.

The masters and grand-uncles of the True Martial Peak above him would probably be suppressed and eliminated by Lord Qingyuan Zhenjun in retaliation.

Setting that aside, the most important thing was that he was already disguised as a Daoist of the Demonic Path. If he couldn't even stay in the Yuan Origin Sect, where else could he go? How could he advance?

Damn it, I'll risk it.

Worst comes to worst, I'll just abandon this body, directly take over the clone Han Shi, and then join the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect. That's also an excellent choice. With the Pure Yang Patriarch presiding, as long as I firmly hug that thigh, I won't have to worry about the future!

If I get through this, then my position in the Yuan Origin Sect will be secure.

"Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, Stabilize! Transform! Defend!"

Xu Yunfan made his decision. Having long been prepared, he erupted instantly.

With a low shout, Xu Yunfan's spiritual power surged within him, and the profound principles of the "Xuandu Eight Scenery Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Manuscript" were pushed to their extreme.

A rich and dense eight-colored cloud immediately弥漫 around his body.

These eight-colored clouds were no longer just for defense or restraint; they also contained the spiritual power of the Divine Sky Nine Palaces Mysterious Firmament, granting the ability to掌管 Divine Sky Thunder, its operational capability, and an indestructible true meaning of生生不息 (endless regeneration) and breaking then establishing.

The pure innate turbid evil origin he had just collected at his feet was毫不犹豫地 drawn upon, continuously pouring into the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi around him.

"Go!"

The eight-colored cloud qi grew with the wind, spreading rapidly like a living creature.

To deal with the magnificent sword light that crossed space and severed karma, Xu Yunfan操控 the eight cloud qi to transform into a huge cloud hand covering a thousand zhang.

Within the cloud hand, space seemed to be solidified and slowed layer by layer. It also contained the breaking army and killing power of the Divine Sky Nine Palaces, as well as the pollution of innate turbid evil on spiritual energy.

The cloud hand did not meet it head-on, but actively迎上, layer upon layer包裹,缠绕, and worn down the sword light that split space.

It was like using an endlessly tough and resilient muddy swamp to engulf the sharpest edge.

The Eight Scenery Cloud Qi could easily refine the sharpness of metal, the hardest and most rigid things, and was also quite formidable in combat and attack.

*Sizzle sizzle sizzle!*

The sound of sharp cutting was incessant. The cloud qi was constantly torn apart and annihilated by the sword qi, but with the continuous replenishment of innate clear and turbid qi, Xu Yunfan continuously打出 several hand seals. The Eight Scenery Cloud Qi not only did not become thinner, but grew thicker and more sluggish over time.

As long as the first attack does not break through the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, then the rest can only be tightly dragged into a entangled battle.

The polluting nature of the turbid evil qi was also constantly eroding, slowing the speed and sharpness of the sword light.
