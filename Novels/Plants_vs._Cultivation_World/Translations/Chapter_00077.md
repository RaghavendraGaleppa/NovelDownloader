# Chapter 77: Life-Saving Jade Talisman

"Congratulations on reaching the mid-stage of Qi Refinement, Senior Sister."

Despite his surprise, Gu Mo didn't forget to offer his congratulations. 

If any servant disciple in the sect reached mid-stage Qi Refinement, it would be cause for grand celebration. After all, the limit for servant disciples with inferior spiritual roots was the third layer of Qi Refinement. Breaking through to the fourth layer meant shattering those shackles, which naturally deserved proper celebration.

But for an inner disciple like Yuan Niya, reaching mid-stage Qi Refinement was nothing noteworthy.

"I heard you've become an outer disciple. This is my congratulatory gift." After accepting Gu Mo's well-wishes, Yuan Niya took out a jade talisman and handed it to him.

After leaving seclusion, she'd learned that Gu Mo had become a spirit planter and successfully been promoted to outer disciple.

"Thank you, Senior Sister!"

Gu Mo naturally wouldn't refuse a gift from the little rich girl. Upon receiving the jade talisman, he discovered it was actually an escape talisman—a life-saving jade talisman that, when activated, could unleash escape speed comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Used properly, it could allow a Qi Refinement cultivator to escape from a Foundation Establishment expert.

"Well? Satisfied?"

Seeing the surprise in Gu Mo's eyes, Yuan Niya smiled. She had many such life-saving talismans, all bestowed by her master and the sect.

With the support of Gu Mo's perfected-level Cleaning Technique and some secret medicines, Yuan Niya had made up for some deficiencies from when she first entered Qi Refinement. After breaking through to mid-stage, she gained six times the foundation of an ordinary mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator—enough to make her a strong contender for becoming a true disciple.

As one of the chief contributors, Gu Mo naturally deserved proper rewards.

"Very satisfied. Extremely satisfied."

Gu Mo didn't hold back his praise. Who would complain about life-saving tools?

"Then, Junior Brother, give me a super-enhanced version of the Cleaning Technique this time." After breaking through to mid-stage Qi Refinement, Yuan Niya worried Gu Mo's ability might weaken the technique's effects, so she requested the super-enhanced version.

"Alright."

Gu Mo nodded. As Yuan Niya's cultivation improved, so did her endurance. She should be able to handle the super-enhanced Cleaning Technique now.

"Hmm? Junior Brother, why is it so fragrant in your room?" Upon entering Gu Mo's small house, Yuan Niya sniffed the air curiously. The scent was peculiar yet strangely comforting.

"It's incense I prepared for you, Senior Sister." Gu Mo lied without batting an eye.

"Really? I love this scent." Yuan Niya was very pleased with Gu Mo's arrangements, especially since the fragrance suited her tastes perfectly.

As she breathed in the faint aroma, Yuan Niya signaled for Gu Mo to begin.

"Ah—"

The next moment, Yuan Niya's face twisted in discomfort. Though she'd reached the fourth layer of Qi Refinement—equivalent to Gu Mo's true cultivation level—his perfected-level Cleaning Technique showed no signs of weakening.

"This shouldn't be happening..."

As Yuan Niya staggered away from Gu Mo's spirit fields, she couldn't understand why his Cleaning Technique remained so potent even after her breakthrough to mid-stage Qi Refinement.

"Could Junior Brother Gu Mo be hiding his strength?" A sudden thrill ran through her at the thought of uncovering his secret. She decided to test him the next time they met.

**Array Peak**

"Senior Sister Chu, where have you been all day?" As soon as Chu Feifei returned to her residence, the servant junior sister she was close with came running over.

"Ah, well..."

Caught off guard by the question and without a prepared excuse, Chu Feifei hesitated.

"Senior Sister, were you on a date with that outer sect senior brother from last time?" Seeing her hesitation, the junior sister's eyes lit up with realization.

The junior sister was remarkably sharp—she'd guessed correctly. But Chu Feifei obviously wouldn't admit it.

"Don't try to deny it, Senior Sister. You're practically radiating the scent of love!" The junior sister leaned in and sniffed, immediately detecting the pleasant fragrance. This only strengthened her conviction—she'd read enough romance novels to consider herself an expert in such matters.

Chu Feifei rolled her eyes at the girl. She and Gu Mo were just... friends. The kind who could entrust each other with secrets.

She also needed to quickly master the Breath-Concealing Technique Gu Mo had given her. Though the fragrance on her wasn't obvious, anyone getting too close might notice.

As time passed, the new season's Water Spirit Rice neared maturity, and Gu Mo finally completed upgrading his fifth second-tier Sunflower. Now, he possessed five second-tier low-grade and ten first-tier mid-grade Sunflowers, along with one second-tier low-grade and four first-tier low-grade Peashooters, plus one second-tier low-grade and four first-tier low-grade Potato Mines.

Absorbing a portion of second-tier Solar Essence, Gu Mo felt a wisp of mist-like spiritual energy form within him. At this point, he couldn't even estimate how many days of bitter cultivation a single portion of second-tier essence was worth.

Mist-like spiritual energy shouldn't appear before the Great Perfection of Qi Refinement. No matter how long one cultivated, it was impossible to achieve otherwise. Yet by refining incomplete second-tier Solar Essence, Gu Mo could directly obtain this energy normally exclusive to Great Perfection cultivators. Once all his spiritual energy transformed into mist, he'd essentially be a Great Perfection cultivator suppressing his realm to the fourth layer of Qi Refinement.

This wouldn't just allow him to fight above his level—it would let him challenge late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators while still at the fourth layer.

Feeling the weight of the mist-like energy within him, Gu Mo knew all his waiting had been worth it.

In the following days, Gu Mo devoted himself fully to cultivation. With five portions of second-tier Solar Essence daily, it took less than a month to completely transform his spiritual energy into mist form.

Next was opening his fourth microcosmic orbit. With mist-like spiritual energy's quality, traversing the meridians was effortless. Gu Mo estimated he'd break through to the fifth layer of Qi Refinement within days.

When the Water Spirit Rice matured, the yield had increased again to 350 catties per mu. This time, the biggest contributor was Gu Mo's spiritual energy—casting spells with mist-like energy dramatically enhanced their effects, equivalent to a Great Perfection cultivator using farming techniques.

The astonishing yield drew exclamations from the Spirit Planting Hall disciples, though considering Gu Mo's status as a spirit planter, they found it perfectly reasonable. Such was the benefit of status—many things no longer needed concealment, as others would naturally find plausible explanations.

Speaking of spirit planters, two more had emerged from Gu Mo's cohort—one being his acquaintance Mai Yunfa, the other an inner disciple named Shan Yu. Three spirit planters in one batch counted as a bumper harvest. With this, Green Dew Sect now had five first-tier spirit planters. Rumor had it the sect leader was considering establishing a Spirit Planting Peak.
