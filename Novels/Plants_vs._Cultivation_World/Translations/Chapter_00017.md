# Chapter 17: Displaying Talent  

"Junior Brother has fortunately mastered the Minor Cloud Rain Technique!"  

Gu Mo repeated his earlier words. From Mai Yunfa's reaction, it was clear that mastering a technique in such a short time was indeed astonishing.  

"Excellent!"  

Upon hearing Gu Mo's words clearly, Mai Yunfa was overjoyed. Gu Mo's mastery of the Minor Cloud Rain Technique at this moment was simply perfect. However, to be thorough, Mai Yunfa asked Gu Mo to demonstrate the technique.  

For Gu Mo, this was naturally effortless. He deliberately slowed down the casting speed to show that he had truly just mastered it, rather than having done so two months prior.  

Once confirmed, Mai Yunfa took Gu Mo on his flying sword to the Administration Hall.  

**Administration Hall**  

At this moment, all the outer sect disciples who weren't in seclusion or away on missions had gathered. The forced labor disciples assigned by the sect had already arrived at the Spiritual Plant Hall, and the next step was their distribution.  

However, facing this batch of unwanted labor disciples, the outer sect disciples present were visibly uncomfortable. Managing spiritual fields required many hands, so everyone was short on labor. Yet, taking in these unwanted disciples was also painful because training them was arduous.  

Even if they were barely trained, their abilities would still be lacking—likely only half as effective as a qualified spiritual farmer.  

"What’s wrong? Everyone’s gone mute? The people are here—those who need labor, take them now," Zhao Qiancheng said, scanning the outer sect disciples.  

Though he knew these were the unwanted rejects, the labor shortage in the Spiritual Plant Hall was real. Without enough spiritual farmers, how could they manage the vast spiritual fields? Poor field management would lead to reduced yields, and the hall’s profits would suffer.  

"I’ll take five!"  

"I’ll take three!"  

...  

Under Elder Zhao’s command, the outer sect disciples began calling out numbers, none daring to take too many. Training these disciples would require significant effort, and taking fewer would minimize the impact. This had been the norm for years.  

Eventually, this year’s batch of forced labor disciples was distributed among the outer sect disciples present, and the matter was settled.  

Just as the outer sect disciples were about to leave, Mai Yunfa arrived with Gu Mo.  

Seeing Mai Yunfa, Zhao Qiancheng’s lips twitched. He had deliberately sent Mai Yunfa away earlier to spare him from the unwanted labor distribution—after all, as a relative, Zhao naturally gave him preferential treatment. The others could only endure it since they lacked a senior in the administration.  

But Mai Yunfa’s sudden appearance now put Zhao Qiancheng in an awkward position. This was an unspoken understanding: during labor distributions, Mai Yunfa was always conveniently absent due to "official tasks," sparing everyone’s pride.  

Now, his presence was nothing short of embarrassing.  

"Have you completed the task I assigned you?" Zhao Qiancheng asked, his expression sour.  

"Elder Zhao, you asked me to check on Junior Brother Gu Mo’s progress—he has successfully mastered the Minor Cloud Rain Technique!" Mai Yunfa blurted out, oblivious to Zhao’s displeasure.  

"What?"  

Mai Yunfa’s words stunned Zhao Qiancheng—and not just him. The outer sect disciples who hadn’t left yet were equally shocked. They knew about the voluntary labor disciple who had joined this year, one who could rent a spiritual field upon passing the assessment.  

They had expected it to take much longer, but in just three months, this labor disciple had mastered the Minor Cloud Rain Technique.  

Mastering a first-tier technique like the Minor Cloud Rain Technique in three months would be normal for inner sect geniuses, but for a newly recruited labor disciple, it was remarkable.  

Curious, probing, and skeptical gazes turned toward Gu Mo.  

"Gu Mo, have you truly mastered the Minor Cloud Rain Technique?" Zhao Qiancheng asked, shifting his attention to the young man beside Mai Yunfa.  

In response, Gu Mo didn’t speak. Instead, he raised his hand and formed a seal. Soon, a dark cloud gathered in the hall, followed by a light drizzle.  

Before the raindrops could wet the floor, Zhao Qiancheng waved his hand, dispersing the cloud.  

"Good, good, good!"  

After dispelling the cloud, Zhao Qiancheng examined Gu Mo with delight. He hadn’t expected this labor disciple to bring such a pleasant surprise.  

The benefits offered by the Spiritual Plant Hall needed someone to realize them—this way, the hall could use it as an example to attract more voluntary labor disciples.  

"Wait—your spiritual energy and physique!"  

Upon closer inspection, Zhao Qiancheng quickly noticed something unusual about Gu Mo. With a full realm’s difference between them, Gu Mo couldn’t hide his condition without proper concealment techniques.  

Not just Zhao Qiancheng—even the late-stage Qi Refinement outer sect disciples present sensed something off about Gu Mo.  

Mastering the Minor Cloud Rain Technique in three months, possessing spiritual energy and a physique far surpassing his peers—these anomalies pointed to one thing: this labor disciple had some kind of extraordinary opportunity. The gazes around him grew complex.  

Gu Mo felt the shift in the atmosphere. The moment he revealed his mastery of the Minor Cloud Rain Technique, he had prepared for this. His countermeasure was simple.  

Taking advantage of Zhao Qiancheng’s questioning, Gu Mo deliberately revealed his perfected-level Cleansing Technique to explain why his spiritual energy and physique surpassed those of his peers.  

His true secret was the Sunflower and the black mist space. While a perfected Cleansing Technique was also shocking, it only proved his exceptional comprehension—something that could explain his rapid mastery of the Minor Cloud Rain Technique in three months.  

"Perfected Cleansing Technique!"  

When Gu Mo demonstrated this, it truly gave everyone present a small shock. The Cleansing Technique was a basic, non-tiered spell that everyone knew.  

But no one had ever thought to cultivate this minor spell to perfection, nor did they know that a perfected Cleansing Technique could cleanse the meridians and refine the bones.  

"What’s so strange about it? The Cleansing Technique was originally inspired by the Bone-Tempering Scripture, created by a great expert," Zhao Qiancheng said, clearly more knowledgeable than the others—including the origins of the Cleansing Technique.  

Among inner sect disciples, some devoted themselves to mastering the Cleansing Technique, aiming for perfection to build a solid foundation during Qi Refinement.  

However, such disciples were rare. Wasting time on the Cleansing Technique without neglecting normal cultivation required exceptional talent and spiritual roots. Those with slightly inferior aptitude wouldn’t dare attempt it.  

Otherwise, spending too much time on the Cleansing Technique without achieving perfection would result in significant losses.  

Yet no one could have imagined that a perfected Cleansing Technique would appear in a mere labor disciple.
