# Chapter 208: Counter-Kill and Blood Exchange

The news of Tuo Ba Li's death sent shockwaves through the Great乾 army. Everyone understood that having such a Great Zhou martial expert rampaging behind their lines was like a thorn in their side.

Xuan Zhen Sect, when Su Zhenhe saw the name he had left in Cangzhou, especially the mention of the hammer, he found it both ridiculous and amusing, but his expression quickly turned solemn, his heart shaken.

"A Flesh Refining Realm expert counter-killing a Great乾 True Blood practitioner of the Soul Igniting Realm comparable to Blood Exchange..."

Su Zhenhe looked up sharply at Yu Jingshan before him.

"He has... achieved perfection in sinews, bones, and skin?!"

Yu Jingshan's eyes shone with brilliance. "Only our Xuan Zhen Sect's true disciple number one could match him. Who would have thought that a small Heavenly Craft Cave could also nurture a true dragon... However, this matter seems to be slandering our Xuan Zhen Sect's reputation. I'm afraid the Master will need to make the decision..."

Su Zhenhe's fingers subconsciously tightened, piercing through the letter without realizing it. He didn't even hear the rest of Yu Jingshan's words.

"Wen Tianyou... I remember, he's still in the Xuan Zhen Secret Realm, right?"

Seventh day of the ninth month, Cold Dew.

Thirty miles outside Yanbei City, the banners of the Great乾 cavalry fluttered noisily in the north wind.

Inside the central command tent, amidst the steaming agarwood smoke from a bronze beast furnace, Yuwen Zhuo, the Marquis of Dingyuan who was stationed in the center, was polishing a three-foot-long golden-inlaid saber.

"Marshal, urgent report!!!" A personal soldier clutching an urgent dispatch rushed through the tent curtain, kneeling before the main seat and presenting the letter with both hands.

The fragrant smoke rising from the bronze furnace swirled around Yuwen Zhuo, yet it couldn't conceal this body that was a veritable weapon of war. When seated, he resembled half an iron tower. The muscles beneath his dark iron heavy armor bulged, pushing the armor plates into fierce arcs. A dark golden breastplate reflected the sinews coiled around his neck, covered in fine golden scales. With each breath, they seemed to open and close like living things, each friction of scales producing a sound like clashing metal.

When this Great乾 commander suddenly rose, the bronze lanterns hanging from the top of the tent dropped three inches. The shadow cast by his nine-foot-tall body almost swallowed the entire northern territory map. Under his dark-colored cloak, the protruding dragon vertebrae along his spine were faintly visible. The skin exposed between the armor plates had a dark golden luster, the texture of muscles and sinews like meteorite iron forged a thousand times. Even the joints of his palms were covered with keratinized, scale-like calluses.

"Report." Yuwen Zhuo tapped the table with his finger. The golden scales on his cheeks shifted as he spoke. When the soldier reported the five words "Tuo Ba Li is dead," the knuckles of this Great乾 vanguard commander turned white. The blade reflected the fine golden scales on his neck, which rippled like living things.

"Killed by a Flesh Refining Realm expert?" Yuwen Zhuo suddenly laughed, as if finding it the world's greatest joke. The sound waves shook the accumulated rain off the top of the tent. As the smile pulled at the muscles around his mouth, those golden scales stood up like the raised scales of a venomous snake, reflecting a chilling glint of fragmented gold in the candlelight.

He inserted the golden-inlaid saber into the short sheath at his waist. As this precious artifact hummed, golden scales spread from his neck to his face. "Tuo Ba Li's family raised a mastiff, yet it was pecked in the eye by a fledgling hawk! That body of贪狼 True Blood has truly followed the wrong master."

Yuwen Zhuo suddenly threw the saber into the table. The carved lion head on the hilt bit into the nanmu wood. "Pass the order! From today onwards, the 贪狼 Camp is to be placed under the command of the Left Xiao Wei. As for the Tuo Ba family..." A mocking curve appeared at the corner of his mouth. "Tell the old ghost Tuo Ba, this commander will retrieve his son's remains for him, if they can still be pieced together into a complete human shape."

A green shadow appeared outside the tent for an instant, and the hanging bronze wind chimes abruptly stopped trembling. Two figures tore through the air, slicing the tent curtain and entering. The old man on the left carried a dark iron heavy sword on his back, fully five feet and seven inches long. The spine of the sword had eighteen blood grooves, coagulated with dark brown bloodstains. The beautiful woman on the right had a red steel knotted whip coiled at her waist, crackling as it moved. Each iron ring was cast into the shape of a fierce ghost devouring a person, and the tip of the whip hung a bone-piercing nail soaked in鹤顶红 (a potent poison).

Both of them wore black robes with blood-red net patterns embroidered on the lapels. This was precisely the "Heavenly Net" formed after Great乾 annexed the ten states of Yanbei Dao, recruiting experts from various sects within those states.

Yuwen Zhuo tossed the letter in his hand. "This brat was in Cangzhou's Luoyan Gorge three days ago, where he hammered Tuo Ba Li to death. He is heading towards Qingzhou. Along the way, Great乾 military personnel will provide you with information. Bring me his head. I want to see what he looks like."

A martial artist capable of killing a Blood Exchange Realm expert across realms was undoubtedly an absolute genius of Great Zhou. Moreover, most of the True Blood generals of the same rank as Marrow Cleansing and Organ Refining were concentrated in the Nine耀 Sect and Yanbei City to prevent the Great Zhou experts from those two locations from breaking out. Especially the Nine耀 Sect, where there was a True Ancestor realm expert standing off against a Great Zhou Nine Realm Qi Refining Supreme Grandmaster, making it impossible to move.

Midnight, the hour of the rat. Xu Yunfan, who had already entered Qingzhou, was regulating his breath in a ruined temple fifty miles from the Divine Weapon Ridge.

He had been fighting and rushing along for many days. The Thousand Jun Shaking岳 Hammer Technique was only eighteen points of proficiency away from the Minor Achievement realm. It was slightly more efficient than fighting that vicious woman at night, but still...

Xu Yunfan sighed. Combat was not his preference. If he could lie low, he naturally would. Given ten years, he would definitely achieve great success in his divine arts and be invincible under the heavens...

He shook the mechanism case containing the Ginseng Spirit attached to his waist, sliding it to his chest. He tapped the玄 steel mechanism with his finger, and the ginseng box forged from meteorite iron combined with玄 steel sprang open with a click. A hole opened within the three-inch square case. Ignoring the ginseng spirit's angry shouts, he took a deep breath.

He opened his mouth and swallowed the boiling spiritual essence spewed by the ginseng spirit. A scorching heat entered from his lungs, transforming into a magma-like heat flow that rapidly dispersed throughout his limbs and bones.

The pure yang internal energy dormant within his flesh and blood, like a flood dragon smelling blood, surged up along his back. Wherever it passed, the muscles and sinews twisted and coiled like old tree roots.

The pure yang internal energy brought by the Great Success of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique could already circulate in a great cycle throughout his body. His sinews, bones, and skin were all flowing within this cycle.

The pure ginseng qi, carried by the pure yang internal energy, circulated through the great celestial cycle. With each pass, his flesh and blood slightly contracted and relaxed. The vertebrae of his spine cracked one by one. The Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength trembled continuously beneath his skin. The nails on his ten fingers lost their color, taking on a cold, hard, blue-gold hue.

*You used a wisp of pure ginseng qi from a thousand-year-old ginseng king to aid your cultivation. Your proficiency in the Pure Yang One Qi Technique has increased significantly.*

A wisp of ginseng qi, finer than a single hair, brought him a full six points of proficiency. The ease of cultivation was far greater than when he sought perfection in his sinews, bones, and skin.

"Screech!" Xu Yunfan's eyes snapped open. He walked out of the ruined temple and looked up at the giant mechanical bird, the Great鸢, circling in the nine heavens above.

Since leaving the Heavenly Craft Cave, Xu Yunfan had specifically requested the Mechanism Hall's Mo Han to dispatch two mechanical birds to constantly warn him of approaching enemies.

Suddenly, the sound of abacus beads clashing came from outside the temple. Seven bone-piercing needles shot through the roof tiles, aiming to钉 into his seven major vital points.

Xu Yunfan's eyes were deep and dark, but he made no move, simply allowing the seven bone-piercing needles to land on his body.

*Clang!*
