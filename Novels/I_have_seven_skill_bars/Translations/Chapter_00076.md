# Chapter 76: An Inner Disciple Senior Brother Arrives

“This is Junior Brother Ding Rui.”

Dongfeng led Jiang She to Spirit Field 520, pointing at Ding Rui as he introduced him.

He was even more dejected. Ding Rui’s astonishing talent in planting had repeatedly dealt blows to his ego, erasing all the pride he had accumulated from becoming an outer disciple and winning accolades in the Pill Hall. He had originally planned to put him out of sight and out of mind, dedicating his time to his own pill refining. But who would have thought? Not being able to compete was one thing, but he couldn't even avoid him. What was this?

When Jiang She first found Dongfeng, Dongfeng was so excited he could barely speak coherently. He had thought his own pill refining talent had shocked Jiang She, but then he quickly realized that was unlikely. As he hesitated, Jiang She got straight to the point, asking him to lead the way to find Ding Rui. Dongfeng felt bitter. But how could he refuse? So, he found himself back at Spirit Field 520.

Ding Rui looked at Dongfeng and Jiang She, not daring to be neglectful. Although he spent almost all his time cooped up in the spirit field, he knew that a predominantly black outfit was the symbol of an inner disciple. Spirit field cultivators wore earthy yellow, while spirit farmers wore a mix of yellow and green.

“During this special period, for a gifted cultivator like Junior Brother Ding to appear is a stroke of luck for my Xuanfu Sect, and indeed for the entire Sect Domain,” Jiang She began. “And Junior Brother Dongfeng’s ability to discover Junior Brother Ding’s talent earlier than most is truly commendable.” As he spoke, Jiang She cast a look of approval at Dongfeng.

“Hehe.” Dongfeng squeezed out a somewhat dry, insincere smile. To be honest, he didn’t particularly want this kind of praise.

“Thank you for your recognition, Senior Brother,” Ding Rui merely replied courteously, then waited for the inner disciple to continue. This was his first time seeing an inner disciple since transmigrating, and he felt a little nervous.

Jiang She indeed didn't have much time to waste. After praising Ding Rui a couple of times, he immediately got to the point: “Actually, the reason I came this time is to ask if Junior Brother could spare some time to help out in other spirit fields?” He explained, “In other spirit fields, after the Meridian-Opening Flowers enter their rapid growth phase, the pressure and difficulty become too immense for the cultivators there to bear, affecting the soil loosening work. I’m currently trying to find some cultivators with spare capacity to help share the burden.”

“And Junior Brother, you were the first one who came to mind,” Jiang She said earnestly.

Ding Rui immediately nodded upon hearing this. “No problem at all!”

Ding Rui was not a selfish person. He knew that the more cultivators there were in the Sect Domain, the better the entire Huaqing Realm would become. Furthermore, with the current pressing war, every cultivator in the sect was extremely busy. The greater his ability, the more benefits he would receive, and naturally, the greater the responsibility he would have to bear.

Jiang She was very satisfied with Ding Rui’s words. He heavily patted Ding Rui’s shoulder and said, “Leaving aside other things, I can guarantee you one thing right now, Junior Brother: if you ever have any requests for the Pill Hall in the future, if I, Jiang She, can achieve it, I will absolutely not decline!”

Ding Rui’s eyes lit up. He quickly said, “Senior Brother, I want to learn pill refining!”
