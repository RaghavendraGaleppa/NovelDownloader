# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 109: The Secrets of Spirit Medicine Mountain  

While organizing his storage pouch, Lin Xuan suddenly looked up to see a yellow streak of light flying toward the southeast.  

He quietly followed.  

The cultivator ahead wasn't particularly strong and wasn't using a magical instrument to fly. Instead, they relied on a talisman imbued with a flight spell.  

Wu Tian let out a sigh of relief and glanced back nervously at the market. He hadn't expected that stealing his master's discarded pills to trade for cultivation crystals would lead to such an incident.  

Fortunately, the danger had passed. Wu Tian patted his pocket—twenty crystals should be enough to sustain him for a while.  

As the market faded into the distance, Wu Tian finally relaxed. Just as he was about to speed up his return to Spirit Medicine Mountain, a blue streak of light shot toward him from behind, blocking his path.  

Startled, Wu Tian had no choice but to stop. The blue light dissipated, revealing an unremarkable-looking young man.  

"E-eld... elder."  

Though the youth appeared much younger, Wu Tian didn't dare breathe too loudly. He bowed respectfully—after all, this was a Foundation Establishment expert, someone who had effortlessly slain that evil demonic cultivator with a single move.  

This elder had even purchased discarded pills from him earlier. Why had he suddenly sought him out? Wu Tian's heart pounded with unease, his expression betraying his nervousness.  

Lin Xuan observed Wu Tian's reaction with quiet satisfaction. In the world of cultivation, strength commanded respect. Since reaching Foundation Establishment, he had clearly felt the reverence low-level cultivators held for him.  

But Lin Xuan didn't put on airs. He had sought Wu Tian out for a reason.  

With a wave of his hand, he said, "No need for formalities, fellow Daoist."  

Wu Tian, though only in his forties and not particularly strong, was shrewd and experienced. Seeing Lin Xuan's demeanor, he relaxed slightly, though he remained deferential. "Elder, what brings you to seek me out? How may I assist you?"  

"Are you a disciple of Spirit Medicine Mountain?"  

"Yes!" Wu Tian answered while inwardly speculating: *Is this Foundation Establishment expert looking to refine pills?*  

But Lin Xuan's next words left him stunned:  

"Excellent. I've always been passionate about alchemy and wish to join your sect. Could you introduce me?"  

"What?" Wu Tian's jaw dropped. After a long pause, he stammered, "Elder... you're not joking, are you?"  

Lin Xuan frowned, feigning displeasure. "Do I look like I'm lying? The path of cultivation is vast, but what fascinates me most is alchemy."  

Of course, Lin Xuan was lying. But his acting was flawless—his fervent expression successfully deceived Wu Tian, who clicked his tongue in amazement.  

*Advanced cultivators interested in alchemy aren't unheard of, but one this young?*  

By Wu Tian's estimation, Lin Xuan was barely twenty yet had already reached Foundation Establishment—surely blessed with an extraordinary spiritual root. For such a genius to abandon the pursuit of immortality for alchemy...  

*What a waste.*  

Wu Tian sighed inwardly, though he dared not show it. Instead, he repeated cautiously, "Elder wishes to join our Spirit Medicine Mountain?"  

"Yes."  

"Well... I regret to say I can't help with that." Wu Tian glanced at Lin Xuan nervously. "To be honest, though I am a disciple of Spirit Medicine Mountain, I'm merely a lowly apprentice. I don't have the authority to recommend new members."  

Seeing Lin Xuan's disappointment, he quickly added, "But don't lose hope, elder. With your Foundation Establishment cultivation, joining isn't impossible—you'd just need approval from a few elders."  

At Lin Xuan's prompting, Wu Tian then explained the unique nature of Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

The sect was unlike any other. Rather than a traditional sect, it was more like an alliance of eccentric cultivators obsessed with alchemy, formed to exchange knowledge.  

Though it had positions like sect leader and elders, these figures held little authority over disciples. Their main role was deciding whether to admit new members.  

Admission required either the sect leader's approval or the support of at least three elders—a stark contrast to how other sects expanded. Typically, cultivation sects recruited either spiritually gifted children to train from a young age or powerful experts to bolster their ranks.  

But Spirit Medicine Mountain was different. Wu Tian initially told a small lie but later confessed under Lin Xuan's questioning: this peculiar sect didn't care about cultivation level. A Foundation Establishment expert might be highly sought after elsewhere, but here, unless one had talent or passion for alchemy, even a Core Formation master would be rejected.  

*That was just how arrogant this sect was.*  

After clarifying the situation, Wu Tian took his leave. Lin Xuan saw him off with a smile, but once the man's figure vanished into the distance, his expression darkened. The situation wasn't as favorable as he'd hoped.  

The Treasure Hunt Convention had been an eye-opener. While none of the major sects in Youzhou—not even the three great powers—had discarded Foundation Establishment pills, there was one place that undoubtedly had plenty: Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

The reason was simple—nearly every sect entrusted them with refining Foundation Establishment pills. Though their alchemists were skilled, refining pills was inherently difficult, and failures were inevitable. Over centuries, they must have accumulated a vast number of discarded Foundation Establishment pills.  

Lin Xuan's motive for joining was clear.  

Initially, he had assumed that as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, admission would be simple—who wouldn't welcome him? But now...  

*Alchemy talent?*  

Lin Xuan fell silent. He didn't even have a spiritual root—how could he possess alchemical talent? Yet joining Spirit Medicine Mountain was non-negotiable.  

Without a new source of pills, advancing his cultivation would be nearly impossible. The herbs needed for Foundation Establishment Pills were exceedingly rare and difficult to gather. His only hope lay in the discarded pills others overlooked.  

After a long silence, Lin Xuan raised his head, his expression resolute. He turned and transformed into a streak of dazzling blue light, soaring toward Spirit Medicine Mountain.
