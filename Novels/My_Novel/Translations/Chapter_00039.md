# Chapter 39: The Madam Appears, Ordering the Demon Monkey's Death

The woman, a veteran of the business world, had sharp eyes. Her gaze darted back and forth, sizing things up with a critical glance. She had already figured Li Xian out.

The fur cloak he wore was made of beast hide and velvet. It wasn't cheap; only the wealthy or noble could afford it. But what kind of distinguished person would come to buy cosmetics in the dead of winter?

Furthermore, beneath the cloak, she spotted standard-issue clothing. He was clearly a servant, a lackey, a subordinate.

He was probably an unpopular one who had been disciplined. Otherwise, how would such a life-threatening errand have fallen to him?

"Young Master, come look over here."

Her attitude became much more perfunctory. She swayed her hips, trying to walk with a graceful, alluring gait, but her figure was ill-suited for it. Li Xian quickly averted his gaze to avoid the visual offense.

She opened a box.

Inside were all kinds of cosmetic powder boxes, in red, blue, and green, all exquisitely decorated and inlaid with pearls, jade, and other jewels.

"Go on, if you see any problems, just let me know," the woman said.

Li Xian casually picked up a box and gave it a light sniff. A faint fragrance lingered at the tip of his nose.

"How much is this one?" Li Xian asked.

"This one? It's a cheap item, about seven hundred wen," the woman replied with a smile.

"Change it. I want one that's around three taels of silver," Li Xian said, waving his hand dismissively.

"Alright then." The woman turned and walked to a display wall. "All the items on this wall are in that price range."

Li Xian stroked his chin, looking at the display wall and falling into thought.

*After I sell the cosmetics, I'll have to return to the manor. The risk is too high. If I can stay a bit longer, I should.*

Li Xian sighed inwardly, feeling his own life was as precarious as the snow and wind in a blizzard.

On the surface, he was carefully selecting cosmetics, but in reality, it was just a silent struggle.

"I say, Young Master, are you going to buy something or not? You've been looking for far too long," the woman said impatiently.

"Do you have anything to eat?" Li Xian asked, not answering her question.

"Fine."

The woman went to the kitchen and brought back a bowl of plain noodles. "Once you're full, you have to make a decision. It's not that I'm trying to keep you, but... what's the point of keeping you for another moment?"

"You have to go back eventually, don't you? This snowstorm won't stop for several days." The woman sat down opposite him, clicking her tongue and shaking her head. "It's a shame, such a good-looking face."

"If it were somewhere else, I might be able to find you some work. But now, who knows if you can even survive this snowstorm."

Although the woman was speaking coldly, there was a hint of pity in her words.

Li Xian said nothing. He wolfed down the noodles, even drinking the broth clean. Then he picked a cosmetic box he rather liked and paid for it.

As he was leaving, Li Xian passed by a stove and had a sudden idea.

He had reached Qingning County partly through luck, but his return was uncertain. Having a stove with him would make things much more comfortable.

He said, "Good sister, could you give me one of these stoves?"

"Ooh, you've got a sweet tongue. Take it," the woman said, waving her hand dismissively.

Li Xian went through the dog door and out of the city wall. After confirming his direction, he began to feel the wind.

He held the stove to his chest. With a layer of clothing in between, it wouldn't burn his skin, but the intense, searing pain was still very strong. Still, it was better than freezing to death.

"It's a southwest wind..."

Li Xian took a step forward, carefully memorizing the initial wind direction. Without any landmarks, he would have to deduce subsequent wind directions based on this initial one.

He walked like this for half an hour.

Li Xian secretly congratulated himself for mastering the "Treading on Snow" ability in advance. Otherwise, with the deep snow blanket, his steps would sink into the snow, distracting him. If that happened, his "sensing the wind to find his position" skill would be rendered largely useless, and he would easily lose his way.

Suddenly, in an instant, the wind stopped.

*A great opportunity!*

He was currently facing due west, the direction back to the manor. With no wind to disturb him, he could use this chance to speed up, greatly increasing his chances of survival.

Li Xian poured all his strength into a mad dash.

After covering about three to five li, the wind and snow returned.

Li Xian slowed his pace, planning to use his old method of deducing his position from the wind.

Suddenly, a shiver ran through his entire body.

A chill spread through his bones. The hair from his feet to his head stood on end, and for a long time, it would not settle.

In the darkness, two lights appeared in the distance, a murky red, flickering as if approaching him.

When they got a bit closer, the two lights turned into eyes the size of brass bells.

A Snow Demon Monkey!

The creature was snow-white all over, with silver fur like needles, a protruding mouth, and no cheeks. Its appearance was terrifying.

*Damn it... how did it find me!*

This encounter was like adding frost to snow. Li Xian didn't care about anything else and buried his head to run.

The Snow Demon Monkey gave chase on all fours. It looked like an ape, but it didn't climb trees. It ran through the snow like a cheetah.

It seemed to be born with the "Treading on Snow" ability as well. Its speed was incredibly fast, and it left no footprints.

Li Xian's heart burned with anger. Just as the demon pounced, he rolled to the side. With his right hand, he scooped up a ball of snow and, channeling his internal energy, squeezed it.

He formed it into a sharp shard of ice and threw it at the Snow Demon Monkey.

This was a little trick he had figured out himself, somewhat resembling the style of a master who "kills with a leaf."

Unfortunately, his skill was lacking. The ice shard hit the Snow Demon Monkey and shattered into dust in an instant.

"Run!"

With the crisis at hand, Li Xian burst into another mad dash. His speed was much faster than before, but it was still far from a match for the Snow Demon Monkey.

In his panic, he ran without looking where he was going and soon lost all sense of direction.

He ran into a mountain. The surroundings were pitch black, and the tracks of the Snow Demon Monkey had vanished.

"Human..."

"You... are..."

Suddenly, the Snow Demon Monkey's voice came from above his head.

Li Xian looked up and saw it hanging from a cliff, its copper-bell-like red eyes looking at him with curiosity. It seemed to want to talk.

"Is it greeting me?" Li Xian's hair stood on end. He saw its gaze shift from curiosity to mockery.

And it finished the next two words.

"Delicious..."

It leaped down to pounce on him.

"Son of a bitch! You can't scare my guts out of me! I'll fight you to the death!"

Li Xian erupted with a fierce resolve. His right hand grabbed the stove, and his palm sizzled from the burn.

He had left in a hurry and hadn't brought his sword. He could only use the stove as a weapon, ready to fight to the finish.

Just at that moment.

"Filthy beast, you've finally shown yourself."

A cold, clear voice drifted over from a distance.

Upon hearing the voice, the Snow Demon Monkey panicked like a dog without a home, fleeing in an instant. Its speed was more than twice as fast as when it had chased Li Xian! It instantly拉开 dozens of yards.

Right after, Li Xian saw a white shadow flash by. The wind and snow were too heavy, and the white shadow was too fast. In the blink of an eye, it had covered a great distance.

He could only vaguely make out that it was a graceful woman.

The Snow Demon Monkey, knowing it couldn't escape, let out a "squeak squeak" sound.

"Human... cunning..."

It lunged at the woman, flailing at her wildly.

The force was so great it whipped up gusts of wind.

But the woman stood calmly in the snow. Facing the Snow Demon Monkey's attack, she simply extended two fingers and, with a light pinch, seized the demon monkey's hand.

An invisible aura enveloped the Snow Demon Monkey's entire body, rendering it completely immobile.

"To become my nourishment is your fate."

The two fingers gave a slight shake. This tremor, starting weak and growing strong, traveled from the monkey's hand throughout its entire body. A "crack, crack" sound was heard, as if bones were shattering inch by inch.

In almost an instant.

The Snow Demon Monkey was no longer in a recognizable shape.

This was not a battle; it was a slaughter. The Snow Demon Monkey's skin was like iron, its fur like needles, its bones like steel. It had many ways to kill an enemy.

But the difference in power was too great. It had no chance to display any of its abilities before it was completely dead.
