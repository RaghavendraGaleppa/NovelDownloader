# Chapter 329: Not Allowed to See White Hair in This World, the System Ranking Begins!

The Qingmu Camp was brightly lit.

Soldiers continuously brought in carts of spoils of war from outside the camp, along with the wounded. Militiamen were cleaning up the battlefield outside, and the entire camp appeared even busier after the battle.

Though busy, it exuded a sense of prosperity.

Outside the main command tent, many generals and soldiers gathered, nervously peering inside.

"How is Young Master Li doing?"

"When Fairy Han brought him back, it looked terrifying."

"He absolutely cannot have any issues. If it weren't for him, none of us would be standing here right now."

"Good fortune favors the virtuous. Young Master Li might very well become the top of the Hidden Dragon List in the future. He charged through thousands of troops and horses; how could he fall in the camp?"

"I won't be able to rest until I see him wake up."

There were many soldiers outside, but they didn't dare speak loudly, all nervously watching the inside of the tent.

Inside.

Young Master Li, whom everyone now called a peerless hero, lay on the bed, his face somewhat pale and his breathing shallow.

The old military physician was taking Li Mo's pulse. After a moment, he stroked his long beard and sighed.

Yin Bing's delicate brows furrowed slightly.

When she had wiped down Li Mo's body earlier, she had also examined him. His injuries looked terrifying, but they weren't life-threatening or beyond medical help.

What did the sigh mean?

Qu Sheng coughed and asked, "How is he?"

"Young Master Li's body is truly a gift from the heavens. After such a great battle, he only suffered damaged meridians and exhausted strength. After some rest, he will be lively and strong again. But as for Commander you..."

"My matters can be discussed later. Prescribe medicine for Young Master Li first."

Qu Sheng finally let out a sigh of relief, stopping the old physician from continuing.

"Young Master Li's condition requires some nourishing and gentle medicine to recover."

The old physician wanted to say more but held back, simply writing as he spoke.

As soon as he finished, a soldier outside ran to get the medicine.

Some needed to be decocted, while others were already prepared in the camp and could be taken immediately with water for emergency use.

After finishing all this, he finally looked at Qu Sheng.

"Commander, you..."

"Let's talk outside."

Qu Sheng stood up and lifted the tent flap to go out. However, the moment he opened the door, his steps faltered.

There were even more soldiers than he had imagined.

Outside was a vast crowd, thousands of soldiers, yet they had remained silent.

Presumably, all the soldiers and generals without logistical duties had come.

This level of prestige was comparable even to the王爷 (Prince) himself. In their eyes, Qu Sheng saw the figure of his younger self from years past.

Back then, the Prince led them to slay a calamitous beast and demon king. What Li Mo did today was far more than that.

If Li Mo were to raise his arms and call out, his brothers would surely follow him through fire and water...

As long as this Young Master Li was alive, soaring ever higher, the brothers would have hope in their hearts.

The Qingmu Camp would not scatter.

"Commander, how are you?"

"Young Master Li, has he woken up?"

Anxious yet suppressed inquiries came one after another.

Qu Sheng cleared his throat and didn't answer the first question, instead comforting them: "Young Master Li hasn't woken up yet, but there's no major issue. He will wake up after proper rest."

As his words fell, the heavy atmosphere seemed to lighten several degrees. These iron-blooded men all showed expressions of relief.

Qu Sheng glanced back into the tent and said, "Alright, everyone go rest. Miss Yin Bing is treating Young Master Li's injuries."

"If you really have nothing to do, go make dumplings. The winter solstice is coming soon, let's all eat together."

With that, he took the old physician and left.

Walking to a deserted spot, where few people came, the area was already covered in white snow.

A figure in white walked into the snow, like a white horse entering reed flowers, its form blending into the vast whiteness, appearing even more fragile.

Qu Sheng turned around and asked softly, "Do you think this general is nearing his end?"

---

"As long as you rest properly..."

The physician wanted to comfort him, but under Qu Sheng's gaze, he honestly said, "This winter."

Commander Qu seemed to have only gone white-haired, but in reality, he was like a burnt-out dry wood. Common life-extending medicines were useless.

He knew that in the Imperial Capital or perhaps those hidden sects, there might be divine items that could steal the creations of heaven and earth, which might be effective.

But such divine items are priceless treasures.

Qu Sheng lowered his eyelids, calm about the approaching death. He looked up at the silver moon in the snow.

"Before the王爷 returns, this matter can only be known to you and me."

Since ancient times, famous generals are like beautiful women, not allowed to see white hair in this world.

But those who resist this day, no matter how elegant they once were, will gradually become like demons, like Han Zhen.

He would not be such a person.

...

In front of the main command tent.

Some soldiers were originally unwilling to leave, but the medicinal soup had already been decocted by Yin Bing and taken inside.

When the wind blew against the tent, the flap lifted slightly.

It was seen that the woman, as cold as the high-hanging moon outside, touched the spoon to her lips with her pearly teeth, then gently blew the soup cool, feeding it into Li Mo's mouth.

"Maybe we should just leave."

"Why leave?"

"Kid, listen to your big brother, let's go back and make dumplings."

"Brother, I'm great at rolling dumpling skins, let's go together."

"Alright then, let's go back together to make~ dum~ plings~!"

The soldiers left in a crowd.

As they left, they even carefully lowered the tent flap of the main command tent and tied it down, so the cold wind outside couldn't blow it open.

Inside the main tent.

Yin Bing finished feeding the medicine and took out ointment to apply to his injuries.

Her eyes were deep and dark. Her fair fingers gently traced the scars on his body. She knew these terrifying-looking wounds weren't fatal, but her biting teeth clenched harder and harder.

It must hurt so much.

If she had already fully formed the Hundred Birds form and gathered the Phoenix Spirit today, having used the True Phoenix Feather, how could she have let him charge into battle alone?

She should have been stronger.

The cool little hand tracing the scars gently brushed over his face, his lips, nose, eyes...

Suddenly, his lips parted and he let out a very faint murmur in his sleep.

"Ice Cube, the battle is over, we won."

"Where is the... gift... you promised me...?"

Yin Bing's fingers curled slightly, her heart-wrenching look turning complex and unfathomable.

Just now he was taking heads from ten thousand armies, cutting down generals and seizing banners, yet now asleep he's talking like this?

What peerless hero...

He's clearly still an immature brat.

Just then.

A very familiar voice suddenly rang in her ear:

【Listing all genius names within the range of the Southern Frontier...】

【Comparing combat power for the host...】

Yin Bing was stunned.

Too many major events had happened recently, causing her to overlook it.

The system ranking she had opened herself—calculating the days, today was indeed the time for comparison.

Combat power is calculated based on the host's current and near-future strength over a period of time.

Yin Bing looked at Li Mo. With his current injuries, he clearly couldn't recover in the short term.

Doesn't that mean...

PS: I'm applying to post two chapters today and sleep early, asking the audience lords to approve. I need to get up early tomorrow to write the outline for the next major plot arc.

This little failure author has never taken a leave or skipped an update. Occasionally, I need to post two chapters to rest and clear my mind, read some books (I swear by my chastity, I'm absolutely not going to play Black Myth: Wukong!).

Please charge and support, mwah!
