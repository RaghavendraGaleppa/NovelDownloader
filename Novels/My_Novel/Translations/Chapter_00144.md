# Chapter 144: A Perfect Fit, Treasure Secured

Not far away, Lin Aoshan’s lips curled into a smile. This was her first time seeing the new "Martial Captain," and he was indeed extraordinarily handsome. She murmured, "The show is about to begin," crossing her arms and watching with great interest.

At the entrance of the martial arts hall, the new Martial Captain stood tall and imposing, his handsome appearance distinct from ordinary people. Behind him lay chaos—members and apprentices lay sprawled on the ground, the earth churned up and tiles shattered.

The moment he made his entrance, his aura was formidable. His eyes were sharp as an eagle's, his spirit as fierce as a tiger's. The hall was filled with famous and respected experts from Qingning County. Accustomed to high status, their words could decide life and death, and they had gradually cultivated an air of noble authority.

Yet, the young Martial Captain showed no fear. Having fought his way here, his aura was even more intense, subtly overpowering everyone present.

"Where did this ignorant brat come from? We are discussing important matters; what right do you have to interfere?" Iron Bear roared. He naturally knew that Li Xian was the Martial Captain, but he deliberately provoked him, calling him an "ignorant brat" while secretly applying pressure with his Qi.

Iron Bear was the master of the Bear Demon Martial Hall. Anyone capable of opening a martial hall must possess considerable strength. The world of martial arts is brutal; without true skill, one cannot last long.

Iron Bear practiced the "Bear Hardening Body Art." This technique tempered his blood and Qi, which soaked into his entire body, causing black body hair to erupt, making him look like a giant bear. His large stature meant his every word and action carried a suppressing weight. A single roar from him could frighten a grown man into wetting himself.

Li Xian, however, paid no attention. "I am the new Martial Captain. This is my duty; how can you call it interference?"

He walked into the hall. The cold gazes of Mei Ren Du, Zhou Long, Hu Shengnan, and Iron Bear shot toward him like arrows. Li Xian remained relaxed and natural, walking up to Iron Bear. "Are you going to stop me?"

Iron Bear’s face twitched with extreme anger. "Ignorant brat, you're asking for death!" He was about to make a move.

Suddenly, Mei Ren Du of the Snake Walk Sect let out a cold laugh. "小子, you said you have a brilliant plan to resolve this? Do tell."

Li Xian replied, "Naturally."

Miao Xichun, helped to his feet, knew the situation couldn't get any worse. "Alright, new Martial Captain, what are your thoughts? I, Miao Xichun, am willing to listen."

Zhou Long said coldly, "If you can't come up with a good idea, I won't be polite to you, even if you are the Martial Captain."

Li Xian said, "Very well. Since you are all willing to listen, then I shall speak."

"I have just taken office and am not aware of the grudges between your various sects. However, the matter at hand is quite simple. In essence, this is a dispute over a 'treasure'."

Mei Ren Du said, "Martial Captain, you must be clear. While there is a dispute, it was Master Miao who, with the magnanimity of the sea, offered the treasure first. We simply didn't know who it would go to, which led to the dispute. Your words make it sound as if we are here to rob by force. We are not bandits."

Zhou Long nodded. "Exactly."

Li Xian smiled. "Let's assume that is the case."

"What do you mean 'assume'?" Iron Bear mocked. "That is the reality. You brat, your words are inappropriate."

He was deliberately finding fault.

Li Xian was not angered. "I won't argue over the facts. Master Miao, since everyone is here for the treasure, please bring it out first."

Miao Xichun nodded and took out a bead. It was a turquoise blue, about the size of a knuckle, smooth as jade, and emanating a faint, mysterious light.

"Ah, so this is the treasure," Li Xian thought, feeling a sense of wonder upon seeing it for the first time.

He said cheerfully, "Truly worthy of being a treasure; it is indeed extraordinary. With such a treasure, whoever gets it will inevitably cause dissatisfaction. If you fight over it endlessly, Qingning County will fall into chaos. Therefore, we must resolve this dispute completely today."

Hu Shengnan sneered. "If the Martial Captain's plan is to divide the treasure into four parts for each of us to take a share, then there's no need to say it."

Li Xian laughed. "I wouldn't suggest such a common plan. It would not only ruin the treasure but also fail to address the root cause. My plan is more thorough and will ensure everyone is sincerely convinced."

Seeing his confidence, everyone was puzzled. They thought, "Could he really have a brilliant plan to satisfy us all?" They fell silent, waiting to see what he would do.

Unconsciously, the rhythm of the scene was entirely controlled by Li Xian.

In the distance, Lin Aoshan's eyes showed approval and curiosity. She asked, "Xiao Sun, can you guess what the Martial Captain's plan is to get everyone to agree?"

Lin Guolong said, "I guess... he might want to invite all parties to sign a contract here. The treasure is unique, and each party will manage it in turn."

"Is that so?" Lin Aoshan was doubtful; it didn't feel like that was his plan.

Inside the martial arts hall.

Li Xian turned to Iron Bear. "You must be Master Iron Bear of the Bear Demon Martial Hall. You have led your hall for decades, with countless disciples. Your martial arts suppress Qingning, truly formidable. Your heroic spirit is peerless; this junior admires you."

Iron Bear was delighted upon hearing this. He thought, "This treasure is unique. No matter what brilliant plan this boy has, it will ultimately end up with one person. He is flattering me so much; does he think I am the strongest and that giving the treasure to me would be the most stable, able to suppress the situation?"

Iron Bear puffed out his chest slightly.

The others' expressions changed, becoming wary of Iron Bear. Li Xian's tone shifted as he looked at Zhou Long. "This must be Master Zhou Long of the Barbarian Body Hall. Your strength is as fierce as a dragon, and your demeanor is extraordinary. If we speak of cultivation, you are the best in Qingning County."

Everyone was greatly confused. He praised Iron Bear first, then Zhou Long. What was the meaning of this?

Li Xian continued, "This must be Master Hu Shengnan of the Red Copper Sect. Speaking of Master Hu, she is truly a woman who is no less a hero than any man, commanding deep respect. Though she is a woman, she makes many men feel ashamed in comparison. Her scheming and wit are unmatched."

"And Master Mei Ren Du of the Snake Walk Sect. You have dominated Qingning for decades, with a vast network and incredible power. You are truly a heroic figure, no less than the previous masters."

"小子, if you have something to say, say it fast! If you have a fart to let, let it out!" Iron Bear roared. Hearing Li Xian praise them one by one, he was greatly displeased.

Li Xian said, "All of you heroes are indeed very厉害, but... in my opinion, not one of you is qualified to manage this treasure."

"Brat, you are audacious!" The four roared in unison. They had just heard his praise and were thinking, "If he recommends me, I will use his good words to take the treasure." After the round of praise, they realized they had been played.

"How interesting, very interesting," Lin Aoshan laughed. The show was more exciting than she had expected. She patted Lin Guolong's shoulder. "Xiao Sun, look, the situation is now entirely in his hands."

Li Xian smiled. "Please don't be angry, everyone. I haven't finished speaking."

Though their expressions were grim, they subconsciously quieted down.

Li Xian strolled leisurely. "I do know of one person who is most qualified to take this treasure."

"Who!" the four asked in unison.

"This person's looks are as handsome as Pan An. In terms of martial arts, he may not dare to claim invincibility, but suppressing all of you is more than enough. In terms of talent and character, heh, comparing you all to him would be a great insult. And in terms of status..."

"This person is the esteemed Martial Captain of Qingning County, specifically in charge of martial world affairs. You are all people of the martial world, so you are naturally a level below him."

Li Xian walked with a smile to Miao Xichun, took the "treasure bead" from his hand, gently wiped it with his sleeve, and then put it away in his robe.

"Everyone, this person is not far away; he is right before your eyes."

"It is I."

For a moment, there was dead silence. Then, the four, enraged, laughed instead. He had gone around in such a large circle only to come back to himself. They had set up this situation with the intention of killing two birds with one stone. Li Xian's words were a slap in their faces.

It was also snatching food from a tiger's mouth.

Extremely arrogant!

In his fury, Iron Bear said, "Brat, you're asking for death!" His entire body's black hair stood up like needles as he slapped his palms toward Li Xian. This martial art was extremely powerful. The moment he struck, there was a series of sharp cracks in the air, as if he were shattering the air itself.

Li Xian did not dodge or evade, raising his hand to meet the attack. Seeing Iron Bear's massive figure, over two meters tall, with immense power and momentum, Li Xian caught it effortlessly.

Li Xian's eyes narrowed. He kicked out. Iron Bear thought, "Not good," and tried to block with his Qi. But he had underestimated Li Xian's brute strength. Taking the kick, his internal organs felt as if they were displaced, and he flew several zhang away...

He was kicked straight out of the martial arts hall.

In an instant, Li Xian's fierce might erupted. Just moments ago, he had been eloquent and good-natured, but now he was completely different. His gaze was cold and dark, an indescribable pressure enveloping everyone.

The power to suppress an army was finally showing its signs. Li Xian sneered, "I know your little schemes all too well. Since you are all here, let's settle this one by one."

He took a step forward, and his black blade left its sheath, drawing a dark arc. It shot toward Mei Ren Du.

Mei Ren Du immediately defended, not daring to be careless. He urgently circulated his Qi, a colorful aura flaring at his shoulders, his chest swelling like thunder, attempting to withstand Li Xian's might.

Li Xian let out a cold laugh, swinging his blade horizontally and vertically. There was no need for complex changes. A perfected blade art is the simplest and has no solution.

In a short while, Mei Ren Du was covered in wounds. He roared in anger, "This boy is厉害, let's join forces to break him!" He now knew that Li Xian was not just boasting but possessed god-like abilities.

Hu Shengnan and Zhou Long's expressions were grim. They exchanged a glance and attacked from the left and right. Li Xian, with a divided mind, raised his palm and struck into the air...

A wave of Qi mixed with water mist crashed forward as if a real great wave were surging. Hu Shengnan was thrown back several zhang, her eyes filled with horror. It was truly unimaginable that this was the martial prowess of a sixteen-year-old boy. The few techniques he had shown had at least reached the level of perfection.

"Brat, die!"

Iron Bear's chest was caved in, with a clear shoe print on it. Now, his blood and Qi were like a rainbow, and the colorful aura at his shoulders erupted. He plucked the hair from his body and shot it out with an extremely precise technique.

The Bear Hardening Art was indeed powerful. It was a lower-grade martial art. During practice, one must constantly soak in medicinal baths to cultivate a body full of bear fur. When facing an enemy, the bear fur is smooth and can卸掉 an opponent's force, serving as a defense.

If he is outmatched, he can also pluck his fur and shoot it, injuring the opponent by surprise. The bear fur hides a hidden poison and is as fine and dense as needles. If it shoots out like a canopy, who could dodge it?

Li Xian laughed. "A good move!" He held his blade with one hand, entangling with Zhou Long and Mei Ren Du. His other hand reached out toward the empty space.

Although his dual pupils were not visible, his eyesight was excellent, and the trajectory of the black needle-like fur was clear. Li Xian used the "Cloud Probing and Mist Taking" technique. His fingers were long and nimble—pinching, grabbing, catching, and stroking—taking all the flying needles.

Not one was missed, not one extra was taken.

This composure was soul-shocking. The arrogant masters of the martial halls and sect leaders all widened their eyes in disbelief.

It was more than underestimating the enemy.

It was like a mantis trying to block a chariot, or an ant shaking a tree—utterly self-destructive.

Li Xian laughed. "Returning this to you!" He shot the black fur in his hand. With two whistling sounds, it pierced Iron Bear's eyes. Iron Bear let out a wail, now blind in both eyes.

Li Xian had integrated the characteristics of the "Gentle Breeze Leg" into the "Great Luo Blade." One was perfected, the other had reached its peak. Combining them made it even more unpredictable.

The Great Luo Blade Art, in its纵横开合, carried the property of a gentle breeze. It was impossible to defend against, causing one to be cut without knowing it.

With several tearing sounds,

Zhou Long and Mei Ren Du were continuously wounded, retreating step by step, unable to resist.

Li Xian leaped up, high above, and struck from the air. The two found it even harder to defend, each having three blade marks carved onto their faces.

Finally, he kicked both of them, sending them flying to crash heavily against the wall. Though they were still conscious, they could no longer summon their Qi and had no strength left to fight.

Li Xian's shoulders showed a colorful aura, his momentum like a rainbow. Suddenly, he spotted a fish that had slipped through the net and threw his black blade.

Hu Shengnan, seeing the situation was unfavorable, tried to escape. She hadn't taken more than a few steps when a flying dagger shot out, piercing her right arm and pinning her to the wall.
