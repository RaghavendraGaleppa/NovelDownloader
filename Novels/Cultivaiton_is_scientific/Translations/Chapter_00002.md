# Chapter 2: Red Beans

Li Shiming walked leisurely along the garden path. It wasn't that he didn't consider moving faster, but he didn't know whether Chief Escort Wang was watching from behind. He needed to maintain a composed demeanor to reassure Chief Escort Wang.

Only after leaving the garden area and seeing his own courtyard did most of his worries dissipate.

Now he faced two choices. The first was to report the matter to his father—the original body's father, Li Wenyuan, who served as the prefect of Nanling Prefecture. Though only a fourth-rank official, he held the highest authority in Nanling. With Li Wenyuan's power, it would be entirely possible to summon experts to eliminate Chief Escort Wang.

The second option was to follow Chief Escort Wang's instructions and brew the medicine according to the prescription.

"I'll deal with it for now. If I can't resolve this trouble myself, I'll ask Father to intervene!" he thought to himself.

After all, Chief Escort Wang needed him to handle this matter and wouldn't harm him anytime soon. With the Three-Day Soul-Severing Pill in play, Chief Escort Wang wouldn't be overly wary of him.

Lost in thought, he entered the courtyard. His maidservant, Siqin, spotted him and quickly hid something behind her back before stepping forward with a smile to greet him.

Siqin was Li Shiming's personal maidservant. Besides her, there were five other serving maids and two elderly women dedicated to attending to him. However, he disliked having too many people in his courtyard. Apart from Siqin, the other servants stayed in the servants' quarters and wouldn't approach unless summoned.

"What are you holding?" Li Shiming asked curiously, noticing Siqin's bashful expression.

"Some trinkets that Nanny Wang brought over. I thought they were pretty, so I took a few," Siqin replied, opening her palm to reveal several red beans.

Li Shiming couldn't help but shake his head. No wonder Siqin was acting shy—these were love peas. It seemed she was growing up and developing girlish thoughts.

Just as he was about to ask Siqin to run an errand, he took a closer look at the love peas. One end of each bean had a black spot, reminding him of the rosary pea—a type of love pea that was highly toxic. Consuming just two or three could be fatal.

Of course, few knew about the rosary pea's toxicity. These beans grew in the far south, and most people didn't even know the difference between rosary peas and ordinary love peas, let alone their poisonous nature.

"Siqin, go ask Nanny Wang how many more of these black-spotted love peas she has. Retrieve any she's already given away—tell her I want them. Give me the ones in your hand too," Li Shiming ordered sternly.

"Yes, Young Master," Siqin pouted slightly, displeased but not daring to disobey. She handed over the beans in her palm.

"Oh, and send Moyan to see me," Li Shiming added as Siqin turned to leave.

Li Shiming entered his study and began copying the prescription Chief Escort Wang had given him, noting only the quantities of the ingredients.

Thanks to the original body's memories, his calligraphy was decent.

This world bore similarities to his previous life yet remained distinct. The country he lived in was called Xia, using Chinese characters and even sharing the Four Books and Five Classics. The parallels between the two worlds were striking.

He knew of these similarities because he had studied the Four Books and Five Classics in both lives. In his previous life, he had often read ancient texts in the university library. Though he hadn't deeply studied these classics, he was familiar with them. In this life, he had studied them since childhood and had already earned the title of xiucai—a scholar who passed the county-level imperial examination.

His xiucai status wasn't obtained through his father's influence but through his own scholarly achievements. For ordinary people, becoming a xiucai at fifteen was no easy feat, but for someone with his family's scholarly background, it came naturally.

While he hadn't relied on his father's position as prefect, his access to superior learning resources and conditions was unimaginable for commoners. As long as one wasn't foolish or lazy, such advantages made passing the examinations inevitable.

The geography of this world also differed from his previous life. For instance, Nanling Prefecture didn't exist in his past world's history. Located in the south of Xia, Nanling was connected to the central Zhongdu and northern Guanhai Prefecture by the Immortal-Severing Canal, forming one of the empire's seven most important prefectures alongside four others in the east and west.

As Li Shiming pondered these thoughts, Siqin and the servant boy Moyan arrived outside the door.

Moyan struggled in with a wooden box, carefully placing it on the floor before him.

"Young Master, everything you requested has been made according to the drawings. Please check if any modifications are needed—I'll handle them immediately," Moyan reported eagerly, clearly proud of his work.

Suppressing his excitement, Li Shiming opened the box. Inside were the parts for a generator, all crafted based on his designs.

Three days after his transmigration, he had used his knowledge of electricity and this world's materials to draft plans for charging his uninterruptible power supply. He had entrusted the task to Moyan, who had now delivered the results.

Before seeing the actual items, he had mentally prepared himself—minor discrepancies could be adjusted. But the sight of the finished products astonished him.

The wooden components were impressive enough, but the iron gears were what truly amazed him. At first glance, they didn't seem like products of an ancient society—their precision made him suspect they had been machine-tooled.

Yet these weren't the most challenging parts. The real difficulties had been the magnet and the copper wire.

He picked up the magnet and found its shape perfectly matched his requirements.

"Young Master, this magnet was made by the Compass Workshop—they used their finest materials," Moyan explained upon seeing his interest.

Compass needles required specially shaped magnets, so crafting one to Li Shiming's specifications wasn't overly difficult for skilled artisans.

Li Shiming smiled and nodded before examining the copper wire. This had been his greatest concern—it required the most technical expertise.

The wire in his hand was thin, flexible, and coated with lacquer. Even by his previous world's standards, it was high-quality.

"This copper wire was custom-made by the Wu family's jewelry shop. When they heard it was for you, they had their best craftsmen work overnight to complete it," Moyan said, not missing any chance to boast of his efforts.

"You've done well. Siqin, give Moyan two taels of silver," Li Shiming said, fully aware of Moyan's intentions but pleased with his work.

Siqin obediently fetched the silver and handed it to the beaming Moyan.

"Moyan, keep quiet about this. Don't go spreading word of the Young Master's affairs," Siqin whispered as she gave him the money.

Though she didn't understand what Li Shiming needed these items for, she knew that engaging in non-scholarly pursuits before the autumn examinations could bring trouble if his father found out.

"Moyan, here's a prescription. Purchase the ingredients quickly. Also, bring me the case files from the Tianxiang Tower incident," Li Shiming said, shifting his focus from the box to the pressing matters at hand.

With his new tasks and silver in hand, Moyan happily departed.
