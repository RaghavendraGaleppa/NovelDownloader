# Chapter 204 Settling In

After seeing off his senior sister and brothers, Li Shimin finally had time to properly inspect his cave dwelling. He felt extremely fortunate about his senior sister and three brothers—Senior Sister Ye was exceptionally generous, while Second Brother and Third Brother, though meeting them for the first time, treated him with such familiarity that their playful banter made it seem like they'd known each other for years. 

Considering Second and Third Brother were mid-to-late Foundation Establishment cultivators who managed many sect disciples and held considerable status, their relaxed demeanor was rare. Only among their own sect brothers could they truly let loose. As for Xu Chuan, he treated Li Shimin like a close friend from the start. Everything felt ideal, confirming Li Shimin's belief that joining the Shu Mountain Sect was the right choice.

He walked through the cave's main hall into the storage room, where empty shelves made of spirit wood lined the walls. After some thought, he took out some of his past spoils—spirit artifacts—and placed them on display. These were either unsuitable for his use or of lower quality, but they held sentimental value as mementos of his adventures. With these artifacts, the storage room no longer felt empty.

In the study, he arranged the desk and chairs from the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's cave, and in the bedroom, he set up a large bed and other furniture made from second-grade spirit wood—luxurious even by Foundation Establishment standards. But since he already had them and wasn't short on spirit stones, there was no need to sell them.

Once everything was in place, the cave finally felt like home. Given the long cultivation periods typical of Foundation Establishment cultivators, he would likely spend many years here.

In the storeroom, six storage pouches lay waiting—gifts from six Golden Core elders. Five had given him four-colored spirit fruits and top-grade second-tier spirit artifact materials. The fruits alone could significantly enhance a Foundation Establishment cultivator's physique even without specialized body-refining techniques. The materials allowed for custom-made spirit artifacts, more practical than pre-made ones since the sect had skilled craftsmen who only lacked quality materials.

The exception was Elder Ma's gift—a jade slip that appeared modest but turned out to be the most valuable. It contained a complete alchemy method, including initial herb processing, furnace techniques, and three specialized alchemy hand seals: 'Green Willow Spirit Sense Seal,' 'Golden Sun Fire Control Seal,' and 'Seven-Finger Pill Collection Seal.' Though unfamiliar with alchemy seals, Li Shimin recognized their rarity from his limited prior exposure to alchemy texts. Elder Ma's gift had essentially paved his way into alchemy.

Li Shimin then took out his communication token and left a message for Yin Shilan. No longer Qi Refining disciples, they had switched from fixed daily chats to leaving messages to avoid interrupting each other's cultivation sessions, which could last months. He updated her about joining Elder Su's faction and acquiring his own spirit peak before putting the token away.

Stepping outside, he surveyed the spirit fields and fruit trees covering the mountain. With Sword Holding Peak now his private property, the previously assigned plant caretakers had left. Normally, one would hire new caretakers until acquiring permanent attendants, but as a plant cultivator himself, Li Shimin activated the long-unused 'Spring Breeze Nurturing Rain Seal.' Dark clouds gathered overhead as his abundant spiritual power allowed continuous casting. Before the first cloud fully formed, a second appeared. After dozens of seals, the entire peak was shrouded in clouds that merged into a life-giving rain nourishing every plant.

He could sense the plants growing, their roots stretching through the spirit soil. 

True to her character, Senior Sister Ye acted swiftly, returning on the third day with three late-stage Qi Refining female cultivators. During those three days, Li Shimin had studied the peak's formation and drafted enhancement plans, though lack of materials delayed implementation.

"Little Junior Brother, I've brought your attendants!" Ye Jingxian announced, gesturing to the three women.

"Senior Sister, why are they all female?" Li Shimin frowned slightly.

"Do you have a problem with female cultivators?" Ye Jingxian's aura flared as her hand twitched threateningly.

"No, no! They're perfect!" Li Shimin quickly corrected, remembering belatedly that his senior sister was also female. Honestly, her demeanor often made him forget.

"Good. They're all plant cultivators. Here's the contract—just sign it. I have matters to attend to." She turned to leave.

"Senior Sister, one more question!" Li Shimin called out. "Where can I purchase materials in the sect?"

"Use our faction's merchant house. Ye Lingyun can arrange it," she said, pointing to one attendant before departing swiftly.

Left with three attractive female attendants and a contract, Li Shimin sighed. Clearly, his seniors hoped to matchmake, but he had no such intentions. The contract revealed their names.

"Ye Lingyun, contact the merchant house. I need to meet with them," he instructed.

"Yes, Master." She bowed.

"The three cave dwellings on the mountainside are yours. Tend to the plants, and don't disturb me—the summit will be sealed." With that, he dismissed them, trusting their competence. For now, allowing them to cultivate in the sect's rich environment was benefit enough.

The merchant house representative arrived promptly. "Zhuo Rui of Heavenly Eye Merchant House greets the Fifth Young Master," the Foundation Establishment cultivator bowed, revealing the house's connection to Elder Su through its name and the title.

Relieved, Li Shimin handed over a prepared materials list. Zhuo Rui was stunned by the volume and variety, especially the numerous rare mundane items that would be laborious to collect for little profit. Normally he'd refuse, but not to Elder Su's disciple.

"Young Master, the mundane items will take time, but the rest can be delivered soon," Zhuo Rui said politely.

"Charge it to this," Li Shimin said, handing over a North Shu Merchant House jade token showing 1.21 million low-grade and 60,000 mid-grade spirit stones—a staggering sum for a new disciple from resource-scarce Tianhai Island. But with Elder Su's backing, no one would dare covet his wealth.

"Payment upon delivery is fine," Zhuo Rui deferred, confident in Li Shimin's solvency.

Over the next month, Li Shimin focused on upgrading Sword Holding Peak's formations. As Elder Su's disciple, he was exempt from mandatory sect tasks, freeing him to reinforce the peak's defenses. The revamped formations created three layers of isolation: the peak's grand formation, the summit's secondary barrier, and the cave's innermost shield, making unauthorized spying impossible.

Additionally, inspired by the cave's spatial formations, he spent 500,000 spirit stones to construct an expanded underground space connected to his cave—a new workshop for his heavy machinery and research.

On the thirty-fifth day, a milestone was reached: 1,500 improved Fresnel reflectors covered the sealed summit, each mounted on motorized swivels controlled by a central computer. The system used solar-tracking algorithms adapted from IBM z15 databases and localized with a month's solar data to precisely capture the first rays of dawn for his 'Purple Qi from the East' cultivation technique.

As sunrise approached, the reflectors adjusted under the computer's guidance. Though untested in practice, simulations had been promising. Seated at the peak's highest point, Li Shimin faced east, eyes closed but acutely aware of the approaching sun. This was the culmination of his planning—maximizing the benefits of his unique cultivation method in complete privacy, shielded from prying eyes.
