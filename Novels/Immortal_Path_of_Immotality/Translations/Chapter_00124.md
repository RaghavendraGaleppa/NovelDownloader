# Release Announcement - The Path to Immortality  

Tomorrow marks the official release. Whether it’s at midnight or noon, I’m still waiting for confirmation from my editor.  

A month and a half, 300,000 words, 8,600 collections—having made it through all four rounds of recommendations, I’m already more than satisfied.  

Now, let’s get to the main points.  

I won’t play games with promises like “more chapters for more subscriptions.” If you’ve read this far, you’re already a true comrade. So, let’s cut to the chase—I’ll be dropping a massive update.  

On the first day of release, expect **20,000+ words** right off the bat.  

Then, **daily 10,000-word updates for the next ten days**.  

Simple and direct.  

As for votes and tips, do as you please. If you enjoy the story, consider subscribing on the main site, Qidian (especially since I’m delivering these updates without any fuss).  

My deepest gratitude to all readers who’ve followed me this far, as well as my editor, who’s been an unwavering support behind the scenes.  

One more thing—let me clarify: **I am a true Kun enthusiast, not a hater.**  

Now, a few words about the novel itself.  

---  

### 1. Is there a female lead?  
**Answer:** Currently, no.  

Early-stage “flower vase” characters aren’t worth the trouble—I have zero interest in writing mere reproductive tools. If a female lead does appear, she will be a **true Dao companion**, someone who can keep pace with the protagonist’s growth. She’ll carve her own legend independently, not just cling to the protagonist.  

A **Dao companion** is different from a **wife**—these are two distinct concepts.  

We’ll revisit this later.  

### 2. Why doesn’t the protagonist just hide and cultivate?  
Brothers, real life is already stressful enough. We’re weighed down by responsibilities, tiptoeing at home and work—must we also endure a novel where the protagonist spends all his time hiding? That’s just depressing.  

This is a classic **“Mortal’s Journey”** xianxia. There are moments of caution, moments of triumph—but it’s not about endless hiding. When it’s time to shine, the protagonist **will** shine.  

If you insist on arguing, I’ll concede.  

The path to immortality is fiercely contested. In the world of cultivation, countless risk their lives for resources. Without struggle, how can one achieve longevity? Should we just sit back and wait for the author to hand out opportunities like freebies? (That’s not a mindset I endorse.)  

Given the novel’s setting and the protagonist’s cheat, his journey is destined to span myriad realms, filled with peril and wonder, until he emerges as a true immortal.  

**This** is the essence of cultivation. Hiding away leads only to a slow death—even with cheats.  

Of course, every risk taken will be rewarded in proportion—that’s a guarantee.  

Readers who dislike this style likely dropped off in the first hundred chapters. If you’re still here, we’re probably kindred spirits—allow me to straighten my robes and greet you as a **fellow Daoist**.

### 3. Worldbuilding and Foreshadowing  
My writing style prioritizes **organic storytelling** over upfront exposition. I prefer laying groundwork first.  

If certain plot points seem questionable in hindsight, you’re right—they’re deliberate setups. Some will be resolved in a dozen chapters, others much later. Rest assured, my outline keeps track of everything.  

So far, **21 unresolved plot threads** are scattered across the story:  

- Qinghe County: **2**  
- Ancient Tomb of Yelang: **2**  
- Imperial Capital, Bianliang: **5**  
- Yichuan: **7**  
- Black Lotus Sect: **3**  
- Eastern Sea: **2**  

We’ll keep digging and filling as we go.
