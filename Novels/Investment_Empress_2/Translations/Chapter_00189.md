# Chapter 189: Red Sleeves Add Fragrance, Princess Jiang Chulong: "Grass!"

"What did that little girl comprehend from the Sword Mark?"

"The phenomenon she's producing is at least ten times more astonishing than Bai Jinghong's earlier display."

"....."

The crowd could see the extraordinary phenomenon but had no idea what was happening at the top of the Sword Pavilion. They wished they could sprout wings and fly up to see for themselves.

On the high platform, the elders had all disappeared. Only the woman from the Yan Tian Zong remained, standing motionless.

Her unfocused eyes suddenly regained their clarity.

"Princess Chulong... shouldn't be here."

"Nor should she have seen the Heng Yun Sword Mark..."

After muttering softly to herself, complex and obscure lines of light swirled chaotically within her eyes.

If Li Mo were here, he would have found it familiar—the technique she was using bore a slight resemblance to the Eyes of Destiny.

After a moment, the woman's face gradually turned pale. Her transcendent eyes became lost and confused.

It was all ruined. Everything was ruined...

......

At the top of the Sword Pavilion, could that little girl really comprehend a divine technique from the Heng Yun Sword Mark?

Everyone held their breath, struck by this absurd thought.

Elder Zeng seemed dazed.

"After Chu Long got close, the strange stone with the sword mark seems to have become more vibrant."

Li Mo felt an increasingly strong sensation in his heart, as if something was being nurtured within the strange stone. Or perhaps, a consciousness beyond his comprehension was awakening.

"Besides the sword mark itself, the stone that carries it cannot be considered a dead object," Ying Bing said softly.

She seemed to understand why, in her previous life, Han Zhen—despite not practicing swordsmanship and having no shortage of martial arts—was still willing to take such a great risk to compete for the Heng Yun Sword Mark.

Suddenly, she noticed Li Mo taking out paper and brush.

"What are you..."

"I want to try and draw the strange stone with the sword mark. If I succeed, wouldn't I be able to observe it every day?"

"....."

If this picture could truly be drawn, it would probably count as an Extremely Form Observing God Diagram.

Ying Bing didn't know what to say to him. Usually, he was a very reliable person, but occasionally, he would come up with some wild, fantastical ideas that were both childish and exasperating.

"Just treating it as practice," Li Mo said enthusiastically as he spread out the paper.

He was just about to pick up the ink stick to grind it when a slender, fair hand beat him to it. The black ink stick contrasted sharply with the girl's jade-white fingers. As she gently ground the ink, the inkstone gradually darkened.

"Why aren't you drawing?" Ying Bing asked as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, only to find Li Mo staring at her as if he'd been paralyzed.

"Ah, yes, drawing..." Li Mo snapped back to attention and began to paint seriously.

Ying Bing moved her gaze over, her eyes filled with confusion.

"Aren't you drawing the stone?"

"Huh?"

Li Mo looked down. With just a few strokes, what appeared on the paper was a girl in a cyan porcelain dress grinding ink with her bare hands, red sleeves adding fragrance... It was clearly a portrait of a court lady.

"Mistake, let's try again," Li Mo coughed, quickly rolling up the picture.

Then he focused his attention on the distance.

At this moment, Jiang Chulong approached the strange stone and bit her lip.

This was something someone wanted, so it wasn't trash, and she couldn't take it. But she really wanted to touch it... She couldn't just touch other people's things, right...?

The little princess wasn't quite sure, so she turned her head back.

Her eyes happened to meet Li Mo's.

Naturally, Brother Li gave her an encouraging look.

"Mm-hmm, I... I understand now..."

Since Brother Li thought it was okay, it must be okay.

So her little hand stopped hesitating.

Before Elder Zeng could even react, his eyes widening as the words "Be careful, the sword-marked stone cannot be touched casually!" were still forming—

*Hummm—*

*Hummm—*

*Hummm—*

In a daze, a tremendous and strange resonance shook the heavens and earth, making almost everyone present feel as if they didn't exist.

Yet, they could vaguely sense something else?

The small world formed by the waterfall and the clear spring was already similar to an inner world projected outward, like an Outer Scene. The moment Jiang Chulong touched it, this small world burst into joy. Fish leaped from the water, growing larger with smoother scales. Lotus flowers, water grass, duckweed, and all kinds of vegetation began to grow. Light green grass spread rapidly from Jiang Chulong as the center, covering the entire top of the Sword Pavilion in an instant.

All things grew.

Jiang Chulong saw even more than the others.

In her eyes, it was above the azure void. A blurry figure, ethereal and immortal, with long black hair dancing wildly, possessed a sword intent that shocked the world. He raised his hand slightly, a blade of grass between his fingers. It seemed as if he was holding an invisible sword, casually swinging it. The heavens and earth seemed to be split by an extremely thin line, layers of clouds shattered, and space itself was cut apart.

"I... I must remember... this sword," Jiang Chulong's mind was filled with countless sword techniques changing and evolving. Unconsciously, the *Wild Grass Sword Scripture* also began to change...

"What kind of martial arts is she comprehending?"

"Could it be that a divine technique will truly be born today?"

Everyone present, as long as they had ever comprehended the Heng Yun Sword Mark, felt a connection and looked up, unable to come back to their senses for a long time.

"This stone is really hard to draw..." Li Mo let out a breath of turbid air.

Even with his current level of soul strength, he found it incredibly difficult to copy. He could only temporarily stop to recover his spirit.

It was fine. When he observed the strange stone up close later, he would be able to draw it then.

......

Not far away, Yin Mianmian squinted her eyes, looking at Jiang Chulong with a thoughtful expression.

She had planned to make a move when Li Mo or Ying Bing were comprehending the Dao, but the opportunity had come earlier than expected.

"Wasn't the Great Yu princess supposed to have her sword bone dug out and become a废废人 (cripple)? But why is she now..."

Her expression changed several times, and Yin Mianmian finally let out a soft sigh. The small figure of Jiang Chulong vaguely reminded her of someone.

She would wait until Jiang Chulong finished her comprehension before making a move. It would be a way to repay the favor to that remarkable woman.

......

Not long after, Jiang Chulong slowly awoke from her trance.

"I... I'm done."

She pinched the corner of her clothes and ran out from the waterfall. The aura and intent were very friendly to her, and she was completely unharmed. She stopped in front of Li Mo, her little face shy, like a little kitten wanting praise.

"What did you comprehend?" Li Mo收回 (retracted) his gaze from the distance and asked with a smile.

"Grass!" Princess Chulong said happily, her voice crisp.

Elder Zeng, who was quite concerned, was stunned, completely thrown off by the old man.

Everyone: "....."

Li Mo: "....."

A cute princess shouldn't say such words.

Well, he knew what Jiang Chulong meant—that the *Wild Grass Sword Scripture* had made progress.

"My head... seems to have... gotten an extra sword..."

"And then... what the teacher taught... also..."

Jiang Chulong said haltingly.

"She means her soul has imprinted the Heng Yun Sword Mark. And the martial arts she has been practicing have also improved, and she has gained two new sword moves," Li Mo translated.

"Soul imprint?"

"She treated the Heng Yun Sword Mark as a God Observing Diagram?!"

Elder Zeng was dumbfounded.

"What about those two sword moves?" he hurriedly asked.

"Compared to... the one you used to split the waterfall... they are... more powerful..."

"A divine technique?!"

Elder Zeng was extremely shocked. His expression changed several times, and after a long pause, he announced loudly to the crowd below:

"Everyone, there is no need to be curious anymore. What this little girl has comprehended are two top-tier sword moves from an Unrivaled Technique!"

"An Unrivaled Technique?"

Everyone's first reaction was one of doubt. The phenomenon earlier was so terrifying, and it's just an Unrivaled Technique? Even a top-tier Unrivaled Technique would hardly seem possible...

Elder Zeng did not delve deeper into this issue. He exchanged a glance with Li Mo, then clasped his hands behind his back and swept his gaze into the distance.

"Hu Mei, you may go up now."

Hu Mei was the alias used by Yin Mianmian.
