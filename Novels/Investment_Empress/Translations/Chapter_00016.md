# Chapter 16: Six Harmonies Attained, The Formidable Beauty Master

The vast training hall fell into a dead silence.

The outer disciples who witnessed this scene all thought they hadn't woken up yet. Li Mo's boxing technique was clearly just learned, yet today, he had defeated Wang Hu, the bully of the training hall. And with just one punch, he had knocked him down so hard he couldn't get up. You call this a beginner? Are true disciples all this outrageous?

In the grandmaster's chair, He Hongfeng's gaze shifted. He had already touched the threshold of the Spirit Gazing Realm, and naturally saw that Li Mo had merely opened up one major meridian. This progress was undeniably fast, but that wasn't what surprised him. Wang Hu was at the third meridian of the Qi-Blood Realm. One meridian defeating three meridians in a crushing victory – of course, Wang Hu's underestimation played a part. But it also showed that True Disciple Li's boxing mastery was far superior to Wang Hu's! He had seen it clearly just now. That punch, at the very least, demonstrated minor mastery of the Six Harmonies Fist!

Wang Hao shot to his feet, quickly went to Wang Hu's side, and channeled internal energy to help him regulate his qi and blood. His expression had darkened to the extreme.

"Since True Disciple Li disdains sparring with outer disciples, then let me have a try."

"Wang Hao, this isn't according to the rules," He Hongfeng said, putting down his teacup and cursing inwardly. You, an Internal Energy Realm practitioner who joined several years ago, want to spar with someone in the Qi-Blood Realm? Have you no shame?! The other outer disciples couldn't hold back when they heard this. When Wang Hu bullied us, we didn't see you say anything. So, it's only allowed when he wins, is that it?!

"I won't use internal energy; I'll just suppress my cultivation to the initial stage of the Qi-Blood Realm," Wang Hao retorted. "An inner disciple seeking guidance from a true disciple, even if it reaches my master, is still within the rules."

Wang Hao had no intention of giving him face. He Hongfeng's expression grew uglier. Was he trying to pressure him with his master's name? The gap between an inner sect elder and an outer sect elder was far greater than that between an inner disciple and an outer disciple. He seemed to have thought of something, and sneered, "Alright, as long as you don't regret it. Junior Brother Li, what do you say? If you choose to avoid the fight, it's fine too."

"Heh heh." Wang Hao no longer paid him attention, his sharp gaze fixed on Li Mo.

Li Mo's eyes narrowed slightly. Since he would suppress his cultivation to the same realm, it might be worth a try. He had only just entered the martial dao, and had never truly fought before. Moreover, during his recent practical combat, a wave of battle intent had inexplicably surged within his chest. Now, as time passed, this intent not only didn't diminish but grew stronger, like a prairie fire. Thus, in his first true engagement with another person, he showed no trace of unfamiliarity, fully unleashing all that he had learned. This... could it also be due to the Profound Prowess Immortal Physique?

"Please enlighten me," Li Mo said softly.

Everyone's minds trembled. Junior Brother Li actually accepted the challenge? He had only been learning boxing and cultivating in the martial dao for a grand total of two days! If it were sparring with other inner disciples, it might be alright, but Wang Hao, despite appearing approachable, was actually a malicious individual...

As he spoke, Li Mo turned his head again. "Senior Brother Xiao, could you move back a bit... huh?" Where's Old Xiao? At some point, his side had become empty. Xiao Qin was nowhere to be seen. Strange, Old Xiao didn't seem like the type to slip away when things looked bad, did he?

"Heh heh, you stick up for others, but they run away," Wang Hao sneered, still fearing his opponent wouldn't accept the challenge. He stood with his hands behind his back, a sarcastic sneer playing on his lips: "To avoid others saying I'm bullying the weak, I'll let you make the first move..."

Whoosh—

Before his words had even finished, the wind of a punch was already upon him. Facing someone looking for trouble, Li Mo wouldn't be polite. His back arched like a bow, his fist like a cannon-hammer. He smashed it directly at a spot three inches below his opponent's ribs.

Feeling the fierce punch wind, Wang Hao raised an eyebrow, not intimidated by the sudden, overwhelming momentum.

Bang—

The two fists collided. Wang Hao's arm went numb from the shock, but he didn't retreat. Confident in his extensive combat experience, he immediately launched a counterattack. But what he didn't expect was this. Li Mo actually seemed incredibly seasoned! He completely disregarded the jab aimed at his chest, instead actively closing in, his arm descending like a steel whip to smash down on his opponent's shoulder. The boxing momentum was continuous, requiring no recovery of breath. Minor mastery of Six Harmonies Fist? Wang Hao's heart quaked, but his punch was already past the point of no return.

He also committed fully, the power of this punch reaching the absolute limit of the initial Qi-Blood Realm, and perfectly unleashed. Minor mastery of Six Harmonies Fist, he knew that too! And besides...

*Hmph*. Wang Hao snorted coldly, pulling his shoulder back. Li Mo's powerful punch landed on his opponent's shoulder, but he found an invisible aura seemingly supporting it, preventing it from fully connecting by a hair's breadth. He himself was struck in the chest by a punch and staggered back a few steps. Internal energy? Li Mo exhaled a murky breath, realizing that his opponent was feigning deflecting the force, but in reality, had used internal energy. But he said nothing, the battle intent in his eyes only growing stronger.

"Again!"

"Hm?" Wang Hao was surprised by the kid's tenacity, his sneer growing colder in his heart. Ultimately, he lacked experience, only capable of a limited repertoire of moves. As the fight continued, his weaknesses would be exposed. This time, he was using the same move as before.
