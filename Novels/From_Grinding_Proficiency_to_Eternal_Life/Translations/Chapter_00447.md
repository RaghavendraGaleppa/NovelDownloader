# Chapter 447: The Concept of Caves-Heaven

As Xu Yunfan sorted the spoils of battle into categories, he suddenly chuckled.

If these treasures were to be obtained normally, it would likely take ten years of arduous effort.

He weighed the cloth bag containing the Blood Marrow Crystals, his gaze sweeping over the lingering auras in the distance that had yet to dissipate. He suddenly felt that having more "treasure-delivering boys" like Li Baichuan wouldn't be so bad after all.

A peaceful life didn't seem that great either; it was too desolate. Without opportunities, cultivation would be impossible to advance.

It was a pity...

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly. After this battle, the Foundation Establishment True Lords within the Primordial Origin Sect definitely wouldn't show themselves easily. The gun shoots the bird that sticks its head out first. If they couldn't kill him in one blow, they definitely wouldn't probe again.

Xu Yunfan was certain that if those Foundation Establishment True Lords still had designs on his Divine Martial Dao Foundation, they would likely end up憋个大的 (stewing up something big) for him in the end.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan frowned slightly, feeling a sudden sense of unease.

He couldn't help but wonder, what exactly was hidden within the True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture he cultivated that allowed him to forge the Divine Martial Dao Foundation, and why was it so attractive?

Xu Yunfan was puzzled.

After much deliberation, he finally decided to go to Hundred Peaks Peak to seek Hundred Peaks True Lord for a clear answer.

Half a month later, when Xu Yunfan arrived at Hundred Peaks Peak on his light-flying art, the bronze bell atop the summit was tolling its third strike.

He had just landed on the square paved with green jade when he saw Hundred Peaks True Lord standing with his hands behind his back beside a stone table under a thousand-year-old Dragon Blood Pine. Starlight flowed across the table as he was deducing the heavenly secrets.

"Perfect timing, Junior Brother."

Without looking up, Hundred Peaks True Lord flicked his sleeve and a jade talisman flew out, hovering before Xu Yunfan. "The garrison commander of Cold Crow Pass passed away via martial dissolution yesterday."

Martial dissolution?

This abrupt statement made Xu Yunfan's pupils contract.

It sounded nice to call it martial dissolution, but in reality, it meant he was beaten to death and had no choice but to reincarnate.

The previous Li Baichuan was killed by him. Because his soul was relatively stable, he might be able to awaken his past life's wisdom in the Sea of Suffering of Samsara and embark on the path of cultivation again.

Cold Crow Pass.

It was a dead land on the border where the Primordial Origin Sect, Bodhisattva Pure Land, and Myriad Chariots Sword Sect stood in a tripartite confrontation.

During the last Great Calamity of Heaven and Earth, the three major sects established a pact there, designating a ten-thousand-mile radius as a buffer zone.

On the surface, it was to prevent conflicts from escalating, but in reality, it was a hunting ground tacitly circled out by the three sects.

Killing people and seizing treasures there wasn't even governed by the sect's rules.

Xu Yunfan took the jade talisman and sent his consciousness into it, causing his heart to sink.

The scene reflected in the jade talisman confirmed his suspicions. On the broken city walls, several corpses wearing the Primordial Origin Sect's attire were being corroded by black mist.

The most shocking sight was the central corpse of a Foundation Establishment peak cultivator.

The top of his skull had been neatly sliced off, and his brain matter was missing. It was the signature technique of the Bodhisattva Pure Land: "抽出髓液炼化成佛" (Extracting Marrow to Refine a Buddha).

If the refinement were successful, the Bodhisattva Pure Land might produce another Great Arhat.

"Does True Lord mean..."

Hundred Peaks True Lord finally looked up, a flash of surprise in his eyes. "You are already nearing mid-stage Foundation Establishment?"

Xu Yunfan maintained his composure. "I've had some insights into the True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture recently, which allowed me to take a step forward."

Advancing in the Dao of Immortality is arduous with every single step.

Hundred Peaks True Lord praised, "Junior Brother is truly a genius who entered the Dao through martial arts. It has only been a little over a decade since you stepped into Foundation Establishment, and you are already nearing the mid-stage. In that case, I am no longer worried about this matter."

Hundred Peaks True Lord swept his sleeve, unfurling a map, and his finger tapped on a blood-red light point flickering in the northwest corner.

"The duty of garrison commander at Cold Crow Pass rotates every century, and it is now the turn of our True Lord Qingyuan's lineage."

Seeing Xu Yunfan staring silently at the map, he explained further, "When the three sects established the pact back then, they set a rule that the garrison commander must be a disciple who has yet to form a Golden Core. After all, if a Golden Core True Lord were to be stationed at the border for a long time, it could easily trigger an interaction of Caves-Heaven auras. Once a real fight breaks out, it would be hard to hold back."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred, and he told Hundred Peaks True Lord about his battle with Li Baichuan a few days prior.

This was a private matter known to all but not meant to be aired publicly.

"So, Li Baichuan..."

"Was merely someone trying to eliminate a competitor in advance."

Hundred Peaks True Lord sneered. "According to past conventions, if you can kill disciples of the other two sects during your tenure, all spoils of war belong to you personally."

He placed special emphasis on the words "spoils of war." "When the previous garrison commander returned, he brought three Bodhi Seeds and half of the Sword Canon with him."

It was a pity he was beaten to martial dissolution halfway through.

Being too arrogant can get you targeted by everyone.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but complain inwardly.

"So, Senior Brother is saying..."

Xu Yunfan's expression was a bit strange. "This assignment is actually a good job?"

Hundred Peaks True Lord chuckled lightly. "Whether it's good or not depends on whether the hand holding the sword is steady enough."

As he spoke, he pointed at the immortal peak suspended in the sky. "The first three Junior Brothers who refused the summons wanted to defect from the sect, and they have already been dealt with."

Xu Yunfan felt a chill. He naturally understood that Hundred Peaks True Lord was saying this for his benefit.

Hundred Peaks True Lord said meaningfully, "Master often says that opportunities are always left for those who dare to reach for them. Those who fear death, even if they reincarnate a hundred times and awaken their past life's wisdom in every life, will never be able to attain the Golden Position or become a True Lord. They will only live each life worse than the last."

Xu Yunfan naturally had his own decision. Since he had boarded the ship of True Lord Qingyuan, he was prepared to see it through to the end.

To put it another way, this big ship was sailing steadily, so there was no need to jump ship.

"I will set off within ten years."

Hundred Peaks True Lord flicked his finger and sent a jade talisman over. "There are still twenty-seven executive disciples inside the pass, enough for you to build your own team. This is the command token."

Seeing Xu Yunfan accept the jade talisman without hesitation, he finally smiled. "I knew you were a sensible person."

Xu Yunfan stroked the words "Zhenyue" (Suppressing Mountains) on the tiger-shaped tally, recalling the Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl bestowed by True Lord Qingyuan five years ago.

That pearl had now completely merged into his body.

Eating someone's food makes you feel indebted; taking someone's things makes you beholden.

In the world of cultivation, karma is a cycle. Today was the time to repay the debt.

"Does Junior Brother have any other questions?"

Seeing his expression, Hundred Peaks True Lord waved his hand and set up a sound-isolating barrier.

Xu Yunfan immediately took out Li Baichuan's storage bag. "This man trespassed on the mountain a few days ago, loudly proclaiming he wanted to extract my Northern Polar Subduing Devil Qi."

He briefly explained the battle process, emphasizing that the other party seemed to have been instigated.

"Just a fool from the Blood Fiend Peak, nothing to worry about. This matter is fine."

Hundred Peaks True Lord sneered. "No wonder the heavenly secrets have been chaotic lately, and my deductions have been unclear. It seems someone couldn't hold back."

Hearing Xu Yunfan's confusion, he thought for a moment, then suddenly pointed his fingers to Xu Yunfan's glabella. "Watch closely! Do not resist."

Xu Yunfan did as he was told, accepting the information transmitted by Hundred Peaks True Lord.

Instantly, a grand scroll exploded within his Sea of Consciousness.

Beneath the vast starry sky, countless bubble-like Caves-Heaven worlds floated and sank.

Some bubbles were only the size of a fist, with twisted mountains and rivers inside; others were as large as a house, already possessing the phenomenon of sun and moon rotating.

And in the center of the scroll, three colossal Caves-Heavens, comparable to mountain ranges, were crushing against each other. They were the sect-guarding Caves-Heavens of the Primordial Origin Sect, the Bodhisattva Pure Land, and the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect!
