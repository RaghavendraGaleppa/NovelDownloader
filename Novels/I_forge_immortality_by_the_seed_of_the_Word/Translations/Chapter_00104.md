# Chapter 102: The Mysterious Lake  

Two hours later.  

A rugged canyon with unfathomable depths appeared in their field of vision. Nearby was a pristine blue lake, its surface as smooth as a mirror, strikingly beautiful.  

Under Senior Qi's lead, the four of them descended onto one side of the canyon.  

The moment his feet touched the ground, Zhang Jing seemed to sense something and immediately turned his gaze toward the azure lake. However, his attention was soon drawn back by Senior Meng's voice.  

Peering into the canyon, Senior Meng asked, "Senior Qi, is the treasure spirit beast down there?"  

"Indeed, that creature is below. It's quite formidable in battle, so I hope the three of you can lend me your strength," Senior Qi replied earnestly, distributing the pre-prepared Enlightenment Tea to Zhang Jing and the others. "Regardless of success or failure, this tea is my gift to you."  

"You're too kind, Senior Brother," the three of them responded in unison.  

"Senior Qi, let's hurry in and finish this quickly. This is the border between the Dragon Lake and Radiant Light regions—delays could bring trouble," Senior Qiu reminded.  

With Senior Qi taking the lead, the four of them flew deeper into the canyon.  

Before long, Zhang Jing landed on a protruding rock ledge, the glow around him quietly extinguishing. His spiritual sense was deliberately suppressed, its fluctuations barely detectable.  

Amidst thunderous breathing sounds, an oppressive aura silently spread.  

"Junior Brothers, don't hold back!" Senior Qi's voice suddenly echoed in Zhang Jing's ears.  

In the next moment, Zhang Jing saw a cluster of blue-purple flames appear in Senior Qi's hand, wisps of scorching heat radiating outward. The flames shot forth, and the spiritual energy filling the canyon instantly erupted as if drawn by an invisible force, converging into the fire.  

In an instant, the flames surged, transforming into a sea of fire that cascaded downward. At the same time, an indomitable will emerged from nothingness, rapidly intensifying, turning the flames thick and viscous. They clung to everything they touched, burning relentlessly, unstoppable and unquenchable.  

Everything visible was engulfed in flames—even the stones were not spared.  

A pained roar erupted from below.  

"Is this the power of a Dao Foundation?" Zhang Jing murmured, his dark pupils reflecting the blazing inferno.  

He saw it clearly. When Senior Qi had attacked, it had been an ordinary spell, yet as it flew, it transformed into something terrifying, its power amplified dozens of times. There was no other explanation—this was undoubtedly the effect of a Dao Foundation.  

As Zhang Jing pondered, Senior Meng and Senior Qiu also unleashed their attacks. The canyon was instantly turned into a boiling pool of molten rock under the storm of spells and raging spiritual energy.  

Zhang Jing couldn't help but smile. He had accepted their gift—how could he not contribute?  

Summoning the Five Treasures Spirit River, he enveloped it with the Dao Intent of the Lunar Frost Dragon, morphing it into a ferocious black serpent exuding icy, ruthless energy. With an earth-shaking roar, the dark dragon transformed into a streak of shadow, carrying an aura of extreme cold, yin, and savagery as it charged toward the lizard-like spirit beast below.  

The terrifying force of the attack was no weaker than the previous spells—perhaps even stronger.  

Boom!  

The weakened spirit beast was sent flying, the freezing energy rapidly seeping into its organs, rendering it immobile.  

Witnessing this, the three seniors couldn't help but glance at Zhang Jing, a weighty realization dawning on them—Dao Intent!  

Time passed slowly.  

The massive corpse of the spirit beast gradually dissipated, leaving behind a robe wrapped in spiritual light, faintly pulsing with immense power.  

"Another treasure-grade robe? And at least mid-tier!" Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed with envy.  

A robe of such quality—  

"Thank you, Junior Brothers!" Senior Qi exclaimed excitedly.  

At the edge of the canyon, four unfamiliar figures suddenly appeared—two men and two women. They seemed drawn by the intense battle.  

"Senior Brother, it looks like someone's hunting a spirit beast down there. Should we join in?" The woman in a red dress at the back smirked as she looked at the black-robed man leading them.  

The man replied indifferently, "A treasure spirit beast on the verge of death—let's wait a moment."  

"The people below are likely from Dragon Lake. Though they killed the beast, this is the border between Radiant Light and Dragon Lake. The ownership of this treasure is still up for discussion."  

"Yes, Senior Brother Hao," the other three responded respectfully.  

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing and the others were slowly ascending the canyon walls.  

"Senior Brother, what's the name of that robe?" Senior Meng couldn't resist asking, his gaze filled with envy as he stared at the robe Senior Qi wore.  

Hearing this, Zhang Jing and Qiu Xiuming also perked up—they were curious too.  

"Haha," Senior Qi chuckled proudly, tugging at his pale yellow robe. "To be honest, I've struck gold this time. This robe is called the Three Yellow Earth Robe—a mid-to-high-tier treasure-grade artifact with boundless power!"  

"Congratulations, Senior Brother!" the three of them cheered.  

Less than half an hour later, the group emerged from the canyon—only to be met with a cold voice.  

"Your actions seem rather improper, don't they?"  

"This is the border between Radiant Light and Dragon Lake. By rights, anything found here should be jointly claimed. Yet you took it and ran?"  

Zhang Jing turned to see a lean man speaking. Though his frame seemed frail, an undercurrent of danger emanated from him. Behind him stood a man and two women, their gazes mocking.  

"Ah, Senior Brother Hao," Senior Qi stepped forward, forcing a smile. "What would you have us do?"  

At this moment, Qiu Xiuming transmitted a message to Zhang Jing via spiritual sense:  

"Junior Brother, this is Hao Muzhao, the strongest cultivator from Radiant Light Dao Academy in the Sixth Heavenly Layer. He's currently on the Ninth Step—we're no match for him."  

"Is the competition between the three Dao Academies that fierce?" Zhang Jing asked.  

"Extremely, especially when it comes to territorial divisions," Qiu Xiuming explained. "Because of Hao Muzhao, Radiant Light has claimed the largest and most resource-rich area."  

Zhang Jing nodded in understanding.  

In the end, under Hao Muzhao's pressure, Senior Qi had no choice but to sell the newly acquired robe to him. Though he received a considerable amount of spiritual essence in return—making the hunt profitable—the gloom on his face remained. After all, how could mere essence compare to the value of a treasure-grade robe?  

Zhang Jing observed everything silently, offering no comment.  

Time passed.  

Hao Muzhao and his group had long since departed.  

With a forced smile, Senior Qi sighed, "Well, it is what it is. Junior Brothers, let's head back. Thank you for today."  

"Senior Brothers, you go ahead. I'll stay to hunt a few more spirit beasts before returning," Zhang Jing said with a smile.  

The other three looked at him in surprise.  

"Junior Brother, your diligence is truly admirable—no wonder you've achieved so much!" Qiu Xiuming remarked, genuine respect flashing in his eyes.  

"Take care, Junior Brother!"  

"Stay safe!"  

Only after their figures had completely vanished did Zhang Jing retract his gaze, turning instead toward the nearby lake.  

From the moment he arrived, his Heart's Eye Dao Seed had faintly stirred—and its source was that very lake.
