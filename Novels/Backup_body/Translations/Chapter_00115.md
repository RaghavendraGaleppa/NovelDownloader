# Chapter 115: Three Realms Divine Conch! Peak of True Qi!

The Great Zhou Dynasty, Central Continent, southeastern coastal region.

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official took out a small boat called the "Ferrying the World" and placed it on the sea surface.

From Shi Yuan's earlier words, they had learned that the descent of the Heavenly Star had caused drastic changes to the overseas immortal islands. One of the Heavenly Stars had even directly fallen onto the Nine Spirits Immortal Island, one of the three great immortal islands!

Where the Heavenly Star landed, a grotto-heaven formed naturally.

Now, the Nine Spirits Immortal Island was enveloped within this grotto-heaven. Any powerful figure who entered the Heavenly Star Grotto-Heaven had been unable to return, turning it into a forbidden land!

"In that case, I won't explore this Heavenly Star Grotto-Heaven for now. I'll first make contact with the other two immortal islands."

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official set down the nautical chart and placed the token given by Shi Yuan at his waist, casting a reluctant glance at the little dragon girl.

"Safe travels, Uncle!" The wall-clinging bird poked its head out, waving its wings in sincere blessing.

"May the wind be at your back!" The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its roots joyfully.

"Flip! Flip!" The Wave-Severing Gu chirped.

"That doesn't sound very auspicious. Why not leave tomorrow?" Yuan Zhengfeng hesitated.

"No matter!"

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official said this and added, "I can't wait to study the myriad creatures of the sea... By the way, Young Friend Zhengjing, are you really not coming with me?"

Li Zhengjing shook his head slightly. "Even if I went to sea, I wouldn't escape my creditors. My opportunity doesn't lie in the ocean."

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official sighed. "Very well. I hope that when I return to the Central Continent next time, you'll be here to meet me."

With that, he took out an object and handed it to Li Zhengjing. "This is the Three Realms Divine Conch I stole from the Ferrying the World Golden Ship. It comes in a pair, male and female. I've separated them..."

The Ferrying the World Golden Ship sought to traverse the myriad realms, soaring above heaven and earth, unbound by the constraints of this world. But when traveling across realms, communication was essential—otherwise, being cut off from news could lead to dire consequences.

Thus, the Second Generation Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World Heavenly Venerable gathered various high-ranking figures skilled in artifact forging to create the Three Realms Divine Conch.

"I'll give you the female conch."

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official channeled his magic power, forming a spell seal. "If anything happens, send a message through this, and I'll know. If anything unexpected occurs during my voyage, I'll also use the Three Realms Divine Conch to contact you..."

After speaking, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official waved his dragon claw and steered the small boat into the depths of the sea.

Watching him vanish beyond the horizon, where the sea met the sky, Li Zhengjing bowed slowly, thinking to himself, *May we meet again, both free from danger and worry.*

"Master, what should we do next?" The wall-clinging bird poked its head out and asked.

"We'll stay here for a month." Li Zhengjing said. "After a month, when I've obtained what I need, we'll go find your grandfather."

"What could possibly come to us here?" The wall-clinging bird looked at the sea. "Are treasures just going to float to us from the ocean?"

"Tree Lord understands! This is like waiting for a rabbit to bump into a tree!" The Five Elements Creation Tree immediately prepared to take root, letting its master guard it.

"We'll return to this coastal area in a month." Li Zhengjing said. "For now, let's go back to Hongshan Town and find a place to settle. I need to cultivate..."

A full month was more than enough time for Li Zhengjing to unblock all his remaining acupoints.

Once all 365 acupoints were opened, his Zhou Heavenly Cycle would be complete, allowing his True Qi to flow freely without any flaws.

Shi Yuan, as a well-known local cultivator, had built a vast fortune with his fists, establishing himself as a young overlord in the region. He dared not show the slightest negligence toward the esteemed Immortal Venerable Zhengjing.

Days passed, and before they knew it, over twenty days had gone by.

Li Zhengjing had now fully ascended to the highest level of the True Qi realm—the peak of the Zhou Heavenly Cycle.

In the past, reaching this stage would have subjected him to the torment of the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi, feeling as though he were being flayed alive at every moment.

But now, Li Zhengjing held an object in his hand that diverted part of the sword qi's sharpness into itself.

This object was the Heavenly Profound Great White Origin Gold.

"This thing is just a fragment. Who knows what it broke off from." Yuan Zhengfeng mused, then added doubtfully, "It's practically indestructible, capable of containing the sharpness of the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi. It's called an immortal-grade divine material, something that shouldn't exist in this world..."

"What kind of power could shatter the Heavenly Profound Great White Origin Gold?" Li Zhengjing narrowed his eyes and murmured, "A battle between true immortals?"

"The piece of Heavenly Profound Great White Origin Gold in your hand is only the size of a fingernail. It can store part of the sharp qi in your body, but not all of it." Yuan Zhengfeng said. "What do we do next?"

"Wait."

Li Zhengjing thought to himself, *Once I obtain more Heavenly Profound Great White Origin Gold and the Great Unity Sword Refining Technique from the Nine Spirits Immortal Island, I can completely rid myself of the sharpness of the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi. Then, I can attempt to break through the mortal limits and become a Human Immortal...*

With this in mind, he stretched lazily, took out a tender leaf from the Yin-Yang Five Elements Creation Tree, brewed it into tea, and took a sip, feeling much more at ease.

Not far away, the Yin-Yang Five Elements Creation Tree had taken root in the ground, its emotions complex.

The Wave-Severing Gu had grown a pair of thin wings and was practicing flight with the wall-clinging bird.

The little dragon girl's life was relatively monotonous—she had over thirty plates of pastries laid out before her.

Meanwhile, Shi Yuan, hailed as one of the top ten young geniuses among the southeastern region's rogue cultivators, was busy roasting meat over a fire, sweating profusely.

"Please wait a moment, honored guests. Little Shi will have everything ready soon."

Shi Yuan was extremely busy, but to demonstrate his attentiveness to Immortal Venerable Zhengjing, he had dismissed all his servants and attendants.

After a while, his steward hurried in and whispered, "Master Shi, the Prefect of Jiangshang Prefecture is hosting a birthday banquet tomorrow and has invited you to attend! It's said that the Prefect wishes to discuss the matter of sea demons appearing along the southeastern coast. The imperial court is offering a substantial reward..."

"We'll talk about it tomorrow!"

Shi Yuan replied.

In the past, even as a True Qi realm cultivator, he wouldn't have dared to slight a prefect of the imperial court. But now, with Immortal Venerable Zhengjing in his residence, he couldn't afford to be negligent.

The steward withdrew, but soon another servant entered.

"What is it now? We'll talk tomorrow!"

Shi Yuan was visibly annoyed and waved his hand dismissively.

"Master Shi, it's a member of the Gao clan from Linyue Prefecture. They've come on their elders' orders."

"The Gao clan of Linyue Prefecture?"

Shi Yuan thought for a moment, recalling that during his recent trip to the capital, he had narrowly escaped death in the grotto-heaven and had formed some friendships with other cultivators.

Among them was an elderly True Qi realm expert from the Gao clan of Linyue Prefecture, with whom he had gotten along well.

"I'm busy now. We'll talk tomorrow..."

Before Shi Yuan could finish speaking, he noticed that the meat in his hands had burned. He sighed and said, "Go find the best chef in town to roast the meat..."

He had no choice but to put down the ruined meat, placate the little dragon girl with sweet words, and casually wave for the Gao clan members to come in.

At this moment, in the main hall of the Shi residence.

"Elder Brother, this Shi Yuan is too arrogant. We've been waiting here, and he still hasn't shown himself?"

"Shi Yuan is known as the 'Mountain-Suppressing Fist King.' Though young, his cultivation is already at the peak of Inner Qi. It's said his heritage is extraordinary—few below the True Qi realm can rival him!"

"More than that! I heard even the imperial deities of the southeastern region have praised him, saying he'll surely reach the True Qi realm within three years and may even have the potential to transcend mortality. They hold him in extremely high regard!"

"Among the younger generation in Jiangshang Prefecture, he's the most outstanding. Even the Prefect intends to recruit him... It's only natural for someone like him to be proud!"

"Moreover, even Third Uncle, a True Qi realm expert, thinks highly of him and sent us to visit him."

"Mind your manners. He's someone Third Uncle treats as an equal. Strictly speaking, we should be calling him 'Uncle'!"

Several young members of the Gao clan whispered among themselves. But when a servant from the Shi residence came to guide them, they realized that Shi Yuan, the Mountain-Suppressing Fist King, was even more arrogant than they had imagined.

These pampered young scions of the Gao clan weren't even granted an audience with Shi Yuan in the main hall. Instead, they were led to the backyard to meet him.

"What arrogance!" A young man from the Gao clan gritted his teeth.

"He's only at the peak of Inner Qi, yet he acts like he's already in the True Qi realm!" A young woman added. "I'm only at the initial stage of Inner Qi, but I might not lose to him in the future!"

"Silence!"

The leading young man scolded. "At just seventeen, he's already at the peak of Inner Qi. His talent is extraordinary, and his heritage is profound. He has the potential to become a Human Immortal and establish his own sect! Even if he doesn't reach Human Immortality in his lifetime, he'll surely be among the upper echelons of the True Qi realm!"

The Gao clan youth's expression was grave. "Now, he's even caught the attention of the imperial deities and the favor of the Prefect, all because of his immense potential. In a few decades, the Shi family will undoubtedly rise to prominence in the southeastern region, just like our Gao clan in its heyday! Someone like him is treated as an equal by Third Uncle. What right do you have to resent him?"

"Big Brother is right!" Another young man, with a scar on his face, said calmly, "You've been spoiled in Linyue Prefecture, where no one dares disrespect you. It's time you broadened your horizons! Today, just think of this as paying respects to an elder of Uncle's generation. That should ease your dissatisfaction."

...

When they arrived at the backyard of the Shi residence, the two young men and two young women finally saw the scene within.

A strange bird was flying in circles around a tree, carrying a worm in its beak.

A little girl squatted on the ground, her eyes bright as she stared at the roasting meat.

The one roasting the meat was a simple-looking young man, sweating profusely—clearly a servant.

At the other end of the courtyard stood another young man, his aura extraordinary. He stroked his chin, seemingly lost in thought, while holding a teacup in his other hand, taking occasional sips.

"Junior Gao Yang pays respects to True Person Shi Yuan."

The leading young man stepped forward and bowed.

The other Gao clan members, seeing Shi Yuan's imposing demeanor, abandoned their arrogance and followed suit in paying respects.

The two young men and two women were all around Shi Yuan's age or older, with the eldest being about twenty-four or twenty-five. Yet they all addressed themselves as juniors.

...

Li Zhengjing remained expressionless, sipping his tea before beckoning to Shi Yuan, who was engrossed in roasting meat.

Having ruined several skewers earlier, Shi Yuan was terrified of making the little dragon girl cry. He had no choice but to start over. Now, seeing the pitiful look in the little girl's eyes and then glancing at Immortal Venerable Zhengjing, he felt utterly overwhelmed.

"Master Shi, the chef is here!"

"Change shifts! Quick!"

Shi Yuan sighed in relief and hurriedly handed over the task. He then jogged over to Li Zhengjing, bowed respectfully, and only then turned to the four young members of the Gao clan.

"I am Shi Yuan."

...

The Gao clan members exchanged glances, their eyes darting between Li Zhengjing and Shi Yuan in shock.

The elegant, carefree young master wasn't Shi Yuan?

The sweaty servant roasting meat was the Mountain-Suppressing Fist King Shi Yuan?

The Shi Yuan who was valued by imperial deities, favored by the Prefect of Jiangshang, and hailed as one of the top ten young geniuses among southeastern rogue cultivators... was serving this person?

"Did Third Master Gao send you here for something?"

Shi Yuan could guess their thoughts and snorted, clasping his hands behind his back. His imposing aura instantly pressed down on them.

He had obtained the heritage of a Human Immortal, but all his skills were self-taught, honed through relentless practice. The fortune he had built in Jiangshang Prefecture was earned with his fists. When he turned serious, an intimidating fierceness radiated from him.

"Third Uncle sent us to deliver a letter to you, True Person."

Gao Yang presented the letter with both hands, not daring to show the slightest disrespect.

The other clan members also suppressed their arrogance, looking at Shi Yuan with newfound awe.

At the same time, they couldn't help but feel that the young man sitting calmly behind Shi Yuan was the truly unfathomable one.

"A letter?"

Shi Yuan opened the letter, his frown deepening as he read. "Third Master Gao has accepted an official post from the imperial court and was ordered to head south... He fears he may not return and that the Gao clan of Linyue will face annihilation. So he wants me to find a place for you in Hongshan Town, to preserve a branch of the Gao bloodline?"

"Such things aren't uncommon."

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice sounded in Li Zhengjing's ear. "Just like how the Luofu Immortal Sect is now in turmoil after the death of its sect master! But ordinary forces aren't as powerful as the Luofu Immortal Sect. Without enough high-ranking experts to maintain stability, they risk being swallowed or divided by surrounding powers. That's why they prepare in advance, leaving a few branches of their clan elsewhere to ensure their lineage survives... These few are likely just one such branch."

"The southern direction..."

Li Zhengjing thought to himself, *The descent of the Heavenly Star—three fell in the Southern Wilderness, and one landed near the border between the Central Continent and the Southern Wilderness, right? This True Qi realm expert from the Gao clan of Linyue was conscripted to explore the Heavenly Star Grotto-Heaven?*

Just as he was pondering this, voices arose from outside.

Shi Yuan was visibly annoyed. He bowed to Li Zhengjing and whispered, "Immortal Venerable..."

Li Zhengjing nodded. "Go ahead if there's business to attend to."

He poured himself another cup of tea and listened carefully to the commotion outside.

Outside the Shi residence, government officials had arrived—they were here to arrest the members of the Gao clan of Linyue!

Shi Yuan had a good relationship with Third Master Gao and clearly believed these officials had been bribed by rival factions to eliminate the Gao clan's descendants. He refused to hand them over.

But the officials were adamant, even deploying a peak True Qi realm expert to suppress Shi Yuan and forcibly take the Gao clan members away.

"We've stayed here for almost a month and owe Shi Yuan some hospitality. We can't just stand by. Wall-Climber, go to the front and make sure Shi Yuan doesn't suffer any losses."

Just as Li Zhengjing was about to resume his cultivation, he suddenly looked up toward the distance.

Outside Hongshan Town, elite soldiers and powerful generals were approaching.

And their leader was a familiar face—the imperial guard commander with royal blood who had participated in the siege of the Venomous Gu King Xin Xuan!

But besides him, troops were converging from all directions, including figures with the heavy aura of official seals—at least at the level of a prefect!

"Something's not right. Why would they mobilize such a force for a few descendants of the Gao clan?" Yuan Zhengfeng sounded puzzled.

"That Third Master Gao must have gotten into trouble."

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin and thought, *Is this related to the Heavenly Profound Great White Origin Gold or the Great Unity Sword Refining Technique? And... it hasn't even been a month yet, and there's already movement?*

With that in mind, he called out, "Wall-Climber, capture them alive. I have questions for them."
