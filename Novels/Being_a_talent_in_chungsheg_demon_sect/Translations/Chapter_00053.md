Chapter 53: Forced into Action

At Skeleton Mountain, the atmosphere remained tense. Luo Wuya, Ouyang Feng, and Yun Zhiqiu, three cultivators at the Great Perfection of Qi Refining, stood in a standoff, neither willing to yield.

Just then, a streak of light suddenly flew from the horizon.

As it drew closer, the light receded, revealing an old monk clad in a kasaya and holding a Zen staff. He cupped a hand in greeting towards Yun Zhiqiu: "This humble monk, Mingchan, greets Benefactor Yun."

Yun Zhiqiu nodded. "‘Demon-Subduing Zen Master’ Mingchan, I've heard of you. You seem to have had a few years of karmic connection with my uncle."

"Benefactor sees clearly," Mingchan smiled faintly. "In the past, when Senior Yun was searching for malevolent forces in the East Sea, he once rested at this humble monk's temple. This humble monk received his guidance, which led to today's achievements."

At this moment, Skeleton Mountain was a chaotic mix of cultivators. The opportunity for Foundation Establishment attracted not only the Divine Martial Gate, First Saint Sect, and Jade Axis Sword Pavilion but also many famous rogue cultivators. The 'Demon-Subduing Zen Master' Mingchan was one of the most outstanding among them, and an extremely rare Qi Refining Great Perfection realm cultivator among rogue cultivators.

It was clear, however, that he was more inclined towards the Jade Axis Sword Pavilion.

Seeing this, Luo Wuya remained relatively calm, confident that True Man Yinshan was backing him. However, Ouyang Feng beside him couldn't help but frown.

After all, as far as he knew, this Mingchan was no simple character.

He was originally a mortal, but he had bowed to Buddha for three lifetimes with unwavering devotion, thus forming a karmic connection with the Buddhist Sect. In this life, he received the mantle of a high-ranking Buddhist monk.

Relying on his three lifetimes of Buddhist affinity, his cultivation in the Buddhist Sect was extremely rapid. The inheritance he received was the most powerful and overbearing "Demon-Subduing Zen" among the Buddhist Sect's teachings. Therefore, he often fought against demonic cultivators, and his combat experience was extremely rich. At least, Ouyang Feng felt he didn't have absolute certainty of victory if he were to face him.

"Counting the days, Miaozhen should be back by now." Yun Zhiqiu made a quick calculation, then glanced at Yun Miaoqing, who lay split in two beside him. He shook his head, "It's just a pity that Miaoqing couldn't escape her tribulation after all."

"Amitabha," Mingchan clasped his hands together, his face filled with worry. "I hope Benefactor Miaozhen is safe."

"Fellow Daoist worries too much," Yun Zhiqiu chuckled. "It's undeniable that the 'Blood-Clothed Tower Lord' indeed has some tricks up his sleeve; he must have cultivated the Demonic Sect's Profound Yin Spirit-Seizing Art."

"However, since Miaoqing is dead, Miaozhen should be unharmed."

"Speaking of which, this is also due to cause and effect. Miaoqing stayed by that demonic cultivator's side but was never defiled by him, which is why she was killed by that demonic cultivator today."

Mingchan nodded at this, then looked towards the market city again, his thoughts racing. He wasn't just here to curry favor; more importantly, he wanted to use this opportunity to climb the high branches of the Jade Axis Sword Pavilion. After all, if one could join a renowned sect, who would want to remain a rogue cultivator?

Just then, a sudden explosion echoed from within the market city.

Yun Zhiqiu burst into laughter at the sight: "It must be Junior Sister's grand success! She's returned victorious!"

Before his voice faded, the Heaven's Escape Sword vibrated violently, its sword light erupting anew and piercing through the void. Then, a figure stepped out from within.

"...Hm!?"

In an instant, Yun Zhiqiu's laughter abruptly ceased.

On the other side, Ouyang Feng also wore a look of shock and uncertainty, and even Luo Wuya's pupils constricted as he stared at the figure in mid-air, filled with disbelief.

"...Lu Yang! He survived?"

"Where is Fairy Miaozhen?"

Completely ignoring the commotion around him, Lu Yang stood proudly in the air. With a wave of his hand, the Heaven's Escape Sword, now without its original owner, immediately flew into his grasp.

This was a good treasure, and it had a karmic connection with him.

The next second, Yun Zhiqiu transformed into a streak of sword light and instantly arrived at the edge of the market city. He deeply gazed at Lu Yang and said in a low voice, "I underestimated you."

Lu Yang glanced sideways. "...And you are?"

"Yun Zhiqiu, Miaozhen's senior brother," Yun Zhiqiu said with a calm expression. "Miaozhen's path of cultivation is not yet severed. Give me her true spirit; I will send her to reincarnation."

Lu Yang paused at his words, then suddenly laughed. "Fellow Daoist, you misunderstand. I am a disciple of the Sacred Sect."

As soon as these words left his mouth, Yun Zhiqiu's expression drastically changed. "What did you do to her!?"

Lu Yang, however, ignored him, laughing loudly, "Fellow Daoist Miaozhen is such a talented individual, what else could I do? Naturally, I interrogated her thoroughly!"

Yun Zhiqiu raised an eyebrow, finally showing anger. "You dare covet my Sword Pavilion's divine abilities?"

Lu Yang remained unfazed, meeting his gaze calmly. "What can you do to me?"

As soon as he spoke, fierce killing intent shot out from Yun Zhiqiu's eyes. However, Lu Yang had no mind to deal with it, merely looking up at the boundless sky.

'Hide... damn it! I can't hide anymore!'

The moment he killed Yun Miaozhen, Lu Yang knew what situation he was about to face—a collective assault, with no quarter given!

More importantly, he clearly felt that after Yun Miaozhen's death, an invisible fortune was suddenly added to him, making his thoughts clearer, greatly enhancing his comprehension, and even loosening the previously unmoving bottleneck of Qi Refining Level Nine!

Lu Yang knew full well that he had to kill Yun Miaozhen.

'This is truly an inescapable tribulation... That True Man did it on purpose! He deliberately sent Yun Miaozhen to find me, intending for her to kill me, or for me to kill her!'

This was clearly forcing a duck onto a perch!

Either Yun Miaozhen killed him and was used by the Foundation Establishment True Man behind the scenes, or he killed Yun Miaozhen and took her place. There was no other path.

A Foundation Establishment True Man, how domineering!

It was precisely because he understood this point that Lu Yang was uninterested in Yun Zhiqiu's threats, because he knew that no matter what, he couldn't keep a low profile anymore.

Because that True Man probably needed a great battle, a life-and-death battle!

Since that was the case, why not be more reckless?

Lu Yang sighed, looked at Yun Zhiqiu again, then adjusted his mindset... Looking on the bright side, at least this showed the True Man valued him.

'They don't fear your weakness, only your lack of value...'

Having cultivated for several lifetimes, Lu Yang understood this all too well: in the Sacred Sect, you only have the right to live if you demonstrate your value in living!

Just then, a figure suddenly approached; it was Mingchan.

"Amitabha..."

He stepped forward, speaking loudly, "Benefactor Lu, I suppose you understand that you cannot escape this tribulation. However, this humble monk has a method that can save you from this sea of suffering."

"Oh? Save me?" Lu Yang glanced at the other party, scoffing, "Then I thank Master for his kind intentions, but I wonder what method Master speaks of?"

Mingchan clasped his hands together, stating calmly, "Although Fellow Daoist is deeply entangled in the demonic path in this life, beyond redemption, you still possess a good heart. This humble monk is willing to personally send you into reincarnation. When you return in your next life, this humble monk will take you as a disciple. At that time, Fellow Daoist might still have hope of achieving righteous cultivation..."

Lu Yang's face became speechless at this. "Personally send me into reincarnation... Master wants to kill me too?"

"It's not killing Benefactor, but forming a karmic connection with Benefactor," Mingchan said with a solemn expression, his aged face filled with compassion. "After Benefactor reincarnates, this humble monk will then arrange for Benefactor to serve as a thirty-year handyman in the Sword Pavilion."

"This way, karma can be cleansed, and in the future, you may cultivate the righteous path."

"I'll 'righteous' your mother's head!" Lu Yang burst out laughing. "A thousand words, ten thousand words, none are as good as a direct confrontation... In my Sacred Sect, broken bones are the best argument!"

As his words fell, a talisman appeared in his hand.

A Wind-Returning Fire-Releasing Talisman!

The next second, the talisman shattered, and Lu Yang's qi instantly returned to its peak. Then, without another word, he drove his sword to strike!
