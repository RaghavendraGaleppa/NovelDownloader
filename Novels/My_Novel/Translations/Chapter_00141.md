# Chapter 141: A Rising Power, Signs of Fall?

Li Xian had become the new Wuxiao Official in Qingning County, and his office now buzzed with activity.

Li Xian stood tall and straight. Though young, he already possessed an imposing aura. The five attendants were all nervous but couldn't help stealing glances at him, unable to hide their curiosity.

"Have any of you practiced martial arts?" Li Xian asked.

"Replying to the大人, I have learned a three-movement saber technique. I'm not sure if that counts as practicing martial arts," Zhang Hou said nervously.

Wang Wu hesitated for a moment, then stepped forward and said:

"The county strictly controls martial arts. As new attendants, if we want to truly learn martial arts, we must endure at least three years of hard work, serving the senior attendants by pouring tea and carrying water. Only after three years can we learn a move or two."

"Among the five of us, Zhang Hou joined the service the earliest, but it has only been a few months. He only learned the three-movement saber technique to deal with ordinary small merchants and vendors."

As Wang Wu was speaking, Li Xian stepped forward, grabbed his arm, and gently pressed and kneaded it, feeling the bones and tendons.

Wang Wu was startled and instinctively tried to pull his hand back. However, he felt that Li Xian's strength was immense; with just a slight exertion of force, Wang Wu could not resist at all.

Li Xian checked each of them one by one.

"Although your bones and muscles are average, if you start practicing martial arts now and are willing to work hard, it is not impossible for you to achieve something."

"I will teach you the [Square Fist]. Practice it diligently. Whoever cultivates the first wisp of Internal Qi first will receive a reward of one hundred copper coins."

"This fist technique must not be leaked to outsiders. Moreover, since you are learning my martial arts, you must obey my commands. If I find out that you are two-faced, commit crimes, or harm the common people..."

Li Xian looked around and saw a wooden stick about half a zhang away. A sharp light flashed in his eyes as he said solemnly, "You will end up like this stick!"

He raised his palm and struck from a distance.

The wooden stick snapped with a "crack" sound, breaking into several sections. The five attendants were shocked, delighted, and terrified all at once. They knelt down one after another and said, "From this day forward, we are the Wuxiao Official's men in life and his ghosts in death. We will never have two hearts!"

"Good, get up. I have some free time today to guide you in your martial arts practice," Li Xian nodded.

The Madam's methods were first-rate. Li Xian had learned a thing or two from her, which greatly benefited him. Winning people over and combining kindness with authority went without saying.

The five were sincerely convinced. In the future, when he dispatched them, they would be like his own arms.

The Square Fist is square on the outside and round on the inside. Li Xian divided the fist technique into two essential meanings: "Square" and "Round."

First, practice the "Square Fist," then refine the "Round Fist."

A good teacher's words are priceless. Li Xian's words were concise and to the point. With just a few sentences, he gave them an epiphany, explaining the true essence of the fist technique.

The five had just started learning the fist technique and didn't understand much. But they respected Li Xian from the bottom of their hearts and engraved his words into their minds. By reflecting on, recalling, and pondering them slowly, their proficiency in the Square Fist would surely not be bad. Even if their aptitude was mediocre, after more than ten years of persistence, they would surely reach the day of "Great Success."

If their aptitude was outstanding and their comprehension strong, they would have the momentum to make rapid progress and advance a thousand miles a day.

After arranging everything, Li Xian did not slack off and began practicing the martial art [Cloud-Chasing Hand].

[Cloud-Chasing Hand]

[Proficiency: 3415/5000 (Great Success)]

Heaven's Way rewards the diligent; hard work will surely bring progress. However, using the right method can double the results with half the effort.

Li Xian moved the large pot from the kitchen to the courtyard.

He then ordered Zhang Hou to fetch a type of "Grass Straw." This grass was originally feed for horses and beasts; its texture was soft. It also had a strange effect: when burned, it produced a great amount of white smoke.

The white smoke coagulated and did not disperse, which was extremely peculiar. It was a wonderful method for practicing the [Cloud-Chasing Hand].

The five attendants watched from the side.

They saw Li Xian put the grass straw into the pot and light it with fire. He covered the pot with a lid, filling it with thick white smoke.

Then he took two sheets of paper. After lighting them, he also threw them into the pot.

The paper burned out, producing black smoke.

In this way, the pot was filled with white smoke, with strands of black smoke mixed within. The two types of smoke were mixed, yet they remained distinct and never blended.

Li Xian's hands were agile. He reached into the pot and extracted the black smoke without disturbing the white smoke.

Reaching into the clouds to take things, reaching into the clouds to take fog!

It was a divine technique.

The smoke was spread out, having form but no substance. To reach into the smoke without disturbing it in the slightest was already inconceivable. To then want to pull the black smoke out was even more unbelievable.

Li Xian walked around the pot. Every time he struck, it was precise and swift. With two fingers, he pinched the fog and pulled it out.

[You reached into the clouds to take the fog, Proficiency +6]
[You reached into the clouds to take the fog, Proficiency +8]

Strands of black smoke were drawn out like reeling silk from a cocoon.

When the pot was filled with pure white mist and not a single strand of black smoke could be seen, all the attendants were amazed and applauded.

[Proficiency: 3754/5000 (Great Success)]

In the evening.

Li Xian gently exhaled the turbid air, his slender fingers shaking slightly to relax his muscles and bones. Today's practice of burning smoke to train his hands had yielded significant progress.

He gave some instructions and left the office.

He turned through several main streets and arrived in front of a clothing shop. The signboard read "Luo Weaving Clothing Shop." The interior of the shop was simple and conventional.

Li Xian walked into the shop. The shopkeeper, seeing Li Xian's extraordinary demeanor, hurriedly came to inquire, showing great respect. He thought to himself, "This gentleman is tall, handsome, and has an unusual aura. Why would he grace my small shop? Did he get the wrong place?"

After a conversation, Li Xian frankly stated his purpose and identified his identity. The shopkeeper then realized, "So it is the Wuxiao Official. I have poor eyesight and did not recognize this great Buddha."

Li Xian asked for the account books to check the shop's business status.

In the Great Wu Dynasty, a bolt of coarse cloth cost about two hundred and fifty copper coins. The shop bought and sold cloth, but the turnover was small; it could only be considered a small business.

As Li Xian looked through the account books, he observed the shop's environment. He thought to himself:

"This weaving shop was a gift from the Zhao family. The shop is about a hundred square meters, but the source of goods is average, mostly coarse cloth. It is bought from the women in the county. This kind of coarse cloth has a small profit; what is earned is just hard-keeping money."

"It's a case of being tasteless to eat but a pity to discard."

"I've already looked at the accounts. In a good month, after deducting labor costs, I can have about two taels of silver go into my account."

This place was "West Wind Street."

The business status was average. If it were on "Red Candle Street," it would be a different story.

Moreover, the shops in Qingning County had to pay protection fees to the gangs. It ranged from a few hundred copper coins to one or two taels of silver. All in all, for an ordinary small shop, although life was better than that of a tenant farmer, it was still filled with fear.

The "Tailoring Clothing Shop" next to the "Luo Weaving Clothing Shop" was also Li Xian's property, a gift from the Lin family.

The situation of the two clothing shops was similar. After checking the account books, Li Xian had a sudden idea: "The Madam has a large mulberry garden under her name, producing precious silk fabrics every month. If I can pluck some wool from it for my clothing shop's business, the monthly income will surely increase significantly."

He closed the account book, his mood greatly improved.

Suddenly, he saw a woman holding a roll of cloth, walking into the shop with her head down.

Li Xian called out, "Auntie Liu."

Auntie Liu was startled and looked around. Seeing that it was Li Xian calling her, she trembled and said, "大人, are... are you calling me?" Her legs went weak with fright.

Li Xian said with a gentle smile, "Auntie Liu, I'm Little Xian. Don't you recognize me anymore?"

"Ah! Li... Little Xian? You're Little Xian?" Auntie Liu was greatly surprised. Upon closer inspection, it was indeed Li Xian. She said, "It's strange, it's strange. Why do you have a red mole on your head? Not to mention, it looks quite nice."

"Ah..."

Auntie Liu thought of something: "Little Xian, you... you... aren't you that young hero?"

"I wouldn't dare claim that, but recently, everyone has indeed been talking about me that way," Li Xian said cheerfully. "Auntie Liu, are you here to sell cloth?"

"Yes," Auntie Liu said. "Some time ago, that fierce Yellow Dragon Army attacked. Your Uncle Wang and I..." At this point, Auntie Liu suddenly realized that Li Xian's status was now different, and she was afraid her words might offend him.

Li Xian smiled and said, "Auntie Liu, let others say what they want. Don't let it affect our relationship. I still need to thank you for Little Fan's matter."

Auntie Liu sighed with relief and smiled. "Little Xian, you are really a good child. You've made a name for yourself now, but you're still so humble. A person like you can go far."

Li Xian pulled Auntie Liu to a seat, brought her a cup of tea, and asked, "By the way, what happened to Uncle Wang?"

Auntie Liu took the cup with both hands and, feeling thirsty, took a sip. She said, "It's nothing. We wanted to run away, but your Uncle Wang fell and broke his leg, so he couldn't run. Later, the Yellow Dragon Army was defeated, and we had to make a living. Your Uncle Wang can't move around much, so I thought about weaving cloth to sell."

Li Xian understood. After pondering for a moment, he said, "How about this. Auntie Liu... you and Uncle Wang help me manage this clothing shop."

Auntie Liu quickly waved her hands. "How can that be? I'm just a woman. Your Uncle Wang is no good either. Besides having a sharp tongue, he has no real skills. What if we ruin your shop? No, no."

"Don't worry," Li Xian smiled. "I'll have someone teach you. If it really doesn't work, you can be an idle manager. Just sweeping the floors daily is also useful."

"This..."

Auntie Liu's eyes grew moist. She was moved and said, "Little Xian, really... thank you so much."

Seeing Auntie Liu wearing coarse cloth with patches of all sizes on her clothes, Li Xian knew the Liu and Wang couple's life was difficult. Now that he had the ability to help, he naturally should.

Seeing Auntie Liu happy, Li Xian couldn't help but think: "Auntie Liu helped me a lot. If it weren't for her paying attention to Little Fan's matter, neither he nor I would have our current achievements. This small favor of mine is really nothing."

His mood was also quite good.

Inside the Commandery Office.

Li Xian had just taken one gram of "Essence Treasure," and the essence of heaven and earth spread throughout his body.

His chest drummed like thunder.

When heaven and earth is enraged, thunder sounds roll. When a warrior consumes an Essence Treasure, his body's aura becomes close to that of heaven and earth, and he can also produce a similar sound, which has the effect of scaring away small fry.

Five or six wisps of heaven and earth essence remained. Li Xian felt comfortable all over, took a cool bath, and sat in the courtyard's grand chair, calculating his gains.

Now that he had a shop in the city, money was coming in daily. Although Qingning County was small, it had forces like the "Pill Pavilion."

Once he had some money, he could purchase pills to advance his martial arts.

The Madam would not protect him forever.

But he could use the Madam's influence to try and carve out his own world in Qingning County.

"The matter with the silk is indeed feasible. If the Madam agrees, the meager profits leaking from her fingertips would be enough to satisfy me."

"But... I still need to think about how to bring this up with the Madam."

Li Xian was lost in thought.

Suddenly, he heard footsteps outside the residence.

"Li Xian, the Madam has come out of seclusion. She is calling for you," Qiu Yue's voice rang out.

Li Xian pushed open the courtyard gate and said, "Alright, I'll go right away."

Qiu Yue turned and left, muttering to herself: "The Madam calls for Li Xian as soon as she comes out of seclusion. Although the Madam is a celestial beauty, she is still a woman in the end. If this continues..."
