# Chapter 296: A Gentleman? So This Is What Kind of Person Li Mo Is!

【Congratulations, Host. You have made the correct choice.】

【The comparison is now restarting!】

Xuan Bing’s personality was such that once she made a decision, she would not hesitate or waver.

Besides, she was already mentally prepared.

She had even experienced the last punishment.

What worse punishment could the System possibly have?

Wait...

Why was she thinking about punishment?

From their journey through the Southern Border, her understanding of him was no less than her understanding of herself.

Her chances of winning were not small.

Even if she lost, she wasn't afraid of the punishment.

【The Host possesses admirable courage, truly worthy of being the peerless genius who has ranked second in the System for three consecutive times.】

“Thank you for the compliment.”

Xuan Bing’s face remained expressionless.

The ice lump just quietly watched to see what tricks he could play.

【The System has also undergone a new upgrade this time, with a completely new upgrade to its mechanics.】

“What aspect was upgraded?”

【It is mainly regarding the punishment for defeat.】

Xuan Bing: “?”

This aspect was the least necessary to upgrade, really.

The System really couldn't match the words "peerless genius" in any aspect other than rewards.

She furrowed her brows and checked the latest punishment mechanism.

【From this point on, the System's punishment will be determined by a Lucky Blind Box draw before the challenge begins!】

【Summarizing the current punishment. The content source is the previous ranker at the top: Li Mo.】

Illusory lines of text appeared one by one, then slowly vanished.

In their place, a screen appeared that only she could see.

Xuan Bing was confused and gently pursed her lips.

She had heard of lotteries, but who ever heard of using a draw for punishment?

And this content source...

Xuan Bing raised her eyes and looked at the young man sitting before the Jade Phoenix God, seriously comprehending the true spirit of the Jade Phoenix God. He was enveloped in a soft light, sitting there properly, looking increasingly sunny and amiable.

Elders would definitely praise him as "the child of others."

Literati would surely praise him as a fine talent, a gentleman.

Did this mean the content of the reward... or the punishment, would be his inner thoughts?

【Do you wish to start the draw?】

Staring at Little Li for a moment, Xuan Bing let out a breath of relief, a confident smile curling her lips.

He wasn't just putting on a show.

What she saw with her own eyes was the truth.

Except for when he was occasionally childish when he was young and now, he truly deserved to be called a gentleman.

For example:

Li Mo wasn't even interested in Ouyang's picture books.

There was nothing to worry about then. She even suspected he didn't have many thoughts suitable for use as punishment.

Xuan Bing shifted her position, lying sideways on the soft couch, and casually picked up a grape to eat.

【Yes.】

As the thought fell, the screen fluctuated, and images gradually began to appear on it.

A young man and woman were walking down the street holding hands. The woman ate a candy given to her by the man.

“Is this what he's thinking about?”

Xuan Bing’s gaze was calm, but she couldn't hide a hint of amusement in her eyes.

Just giving her a candy? She had even eaten the sugar figure Li Mo made today. Could this count as a punishment? So his mind...

The next second.

“I want some too.”

“But there's only one.”

“I want this one.”

The two ate a single piece of candy, the kind that stretches.

【Punishment Preview One: Eating Imported Candy.】

Xuan Bing: “?”

Her beautiful, mirror-like eyes widened in a daze, and her fingertips couldn't help but curl slightly.

Actually, the two had already shared the same cup. Sometimes when they ate, Li Mo would use his own chopsticks to pick up food and feed it to her mouth, and she would habitively open her mouth to eat it.

---

But she suddenly recalled that when she was eating the sugar figure today, her mouth was stained with sticky sugar juice.

He had casually wiped it clean, then turned around and slurped his noodles with those same fingers.

At the time, Xuan Bing felt a faint, strange sensation.

Now, that sensation was materialized, and it was no longer faint.

“Is this what a gentleman... is supposed to think?”

As everyone knows, forgetting a terrible thing is simple, as long as you know something even worse.

Before Xuan Bing could calm her mind, the screen rolled again.

As everyone also knows.

Little Li, carrying the memories of his past life from the womb, had been subjected to all kinds of information shocks, and in certain group chats, from some kind-hearted people who loved to share, he had opened the door to a new world.

This is something most people experience, sooner or later...

But the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands were different.

Some things, the Empress of the Phoenix, who had spent many lonely years in the desolate Moon Palace, had not only never heard of, but couldn't even imagine.

“So that's why he likes feet...”

“It’s not just feet...”

...

A long while later.

Xuan Bing’s eyes widened slightly, but she saw her own small feet, still wet with moisture. She couldn't help but turn her gaze away.

But the images kept popping up in her mind.

“He... where is he a gentleman?”

“He’s clearly a bad thing...”

Xuan Bing looked at the young man sitting there with a deep gaze, unable to help but curl her legs up and hug them.

There were a total of twenty punishments available for selection.

Imported candy was actually the lightest punishment; the rest were all things that opened the doors to a new world.

The bad news was.

She had to pick one from these twenty to serve as the condition for the next punishment.

【Please, Host, draw the next punishment!】

On the screen, blind boxes flashing with various lights began to change positions, making one dizzy.

Xuan Bing took a light breath and extended her finger.

.......

The next morning.

Li Mo rubbed his temples as he got up. The true spirit within the Jade Phoenix God yesterday was the most violent one he had ever come into contact with.

He had struggled the entire night, yet it was extremely difficult to fuse it into the Seventy-Two Transformations.

Ziya.

Even with only its true spirit remaining, it possessed deep-seated wildness and a love for battle.

He had to either satisfy this Ziya true spirit or continue with the slow, painstaking work.

“I thought I could perfect the Seventy-Two Transformations last night.”

“Ice lump...”

Little Li was just about to ask Xuan Bing what she wanted for breakfast.

However, when he turned around, he saw Xuan Bing hugging her jade legs with both arms, looking at him with a deep gaze. When their eyes met, her gaze trembled slightly, and she turned her head away.

“......”

Little Li had no idea what had happened and picked up his teacup to take a drink.

“What's wrong?”

“I thought you only liked feet.”

“Pfft...”

The tea Little Li had just put in his mouth couldn't be held back.

“That was just a professional habit...”

“But it seems you wanted to do more than just rub.”

Xuan Bing said with her eyes downcast.

Li Mo felt a bit guilty under her gaze. “Who said that? Ice lump, that’s slander!”

“Hmph... Gentleman...”

Little Li didn't know why the ice lump had suddenly said this.

But the meaning didn't seem very positive.

Just then.

Zhong Zhenyue’s voice came from below the tavern. He had come to take Li Mo to the Green Wood Camp.
