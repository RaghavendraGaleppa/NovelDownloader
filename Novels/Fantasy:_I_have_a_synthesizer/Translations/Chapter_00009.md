# Chapter 9: Outside the City, Killing Intent Appears!

The next day, as the morning sun gently scattered its rays, Su Yu awoke from his cultivation.

In just one night, Su Yu's qi and blood cultivation had actually surged. Although it was only a certain increase in qi and blood, one must remember that even to become a quasi-martial artist, only a specific amount of qi and blood is required. Before obtaining a formal martial artist cultivation technique, cultivating qi and blood was inherently very slow.

Yesterday, the Martial Artist Association had already delivered the official martial artist cultivation technique. It was called the 《Basic Guidance Method》. Though it was only considered a Rank 1 cultivation technique, even so, relying on the Basic Guidance Method, his cultivation speed had clearly increased severalfold.

"What a pity, there's only one copy. I'll have to find some time to see if I can get a few more. The cultivation technique that's synthesized from them will definitely be even more powerful!"

Just the Basic Guidance Method alone had brought him such terrifying improvements. For a moment, Su Yu was even looking forward to future syntheses.

He looked out the window, where rays of sunlight streamed in. Su Yu smiled faintly.

"I want to see what schemes that Liu Yiyi is planning today!"

With his current level of qi and blood, combined with the existence of the Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist, Su Yu was confident he could easily overpower anyone below the late-stage Qi and Blood Realm. Even if he encountered a late-stage Qi and Blood Realm expert, Su Yu was confident he could escape.

*Nonsense about not needing others.* It was just so that when she made her move against him, no bystanders would waste her time.

Su Yu remained calm on the surface and said indifferently, "Since that's the case, let's set off!"

Liu Yiyi's beautiful eyes flickered slightly, her long eyelashes subtly trembling. "Is Brother Su Yu really that eager? Well, alright then!" With that, she put on an innocent expression.

Su Yu saw it and felt rows of black lines descend in his mind. *Damn it, she's not just cloying, she's a manipulative green tea bitch too!*

Su Yu took a deep breath. "Calm down, calm down. If it weren't for wanting to expose the mastermind later, I'd definitely kill her right now!"

Su Yu finally managed to compose himself, then slowly said, "No time to lose, I still need to continue cultivating after this!"

Liu Yiyi displayed an adoring look. "Wow, Brother Su Yu is so amazing! He's already a martial artist, yet still so diligent. Brother Su Yu will surely become an important figure in Heng City in the future!"

Su Yu's mouth twitched slightly. This girl seemed to be more than just a simple green tea bitch.

After being annihilated by powerful cultivators, new fierce beasts would emerge after a period of time. By now, humanity generally no longer easily made a move, instead merely focusing on defense. Firstly, fierce beasts were inexhaustible anyway. Secondly, fierce beasts rarely attacked cities unless human experts provoked and angered them. Between the two, there was a sense of uneasy coexistence.

As time passed, the two gradually ventured deeper into the outskirts. Su Yu slowed his pace, deliberately feigning a look of confusion.

"Liu Yiyi, what kind of fierce beast are you planning to hunt? If we go any deeper, we might even encounter Blood Refinement Realm fierce beasts, and we're no match for those!"

Liu Yiyi uncharacteristically did not agree with Su Yu's words. Instead, she looked around.

Su Yu's eyebrow twitched slightly, and an almost imperceptible curve appeared at the corner of his mouth.

*Finally unable to hold back, are you?*
