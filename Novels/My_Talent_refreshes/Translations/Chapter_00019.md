# Chapter 19: Qinghe Market  

A familiar voice sounded as a figure pushed open the door and entered.  

Chu Ning's heart stirred slightly. In the next moment, he formed a hand seal and cast Thorn Vine Technique!  

The two ironvine plants near the courtyard gate immediately shot out, coiling around the newcomer and rendering them immobile.  

However, Chu Ning did not continue to channel the spell, so the vines neither tightened further nor sprouted thorns. Even so, the sudden attack startled the visitor.  

"Hey, hey! It's me, Qiu Shunyi!"  

The newcomer was indeed Qiu Shunyi, his slightly tanned face now filled with shock.  

"Ah, it's just you, Shunyi!"  

Chu Ning laughed heartily and withdrew the vines with another hand seal.  

Qiu Shunyi patted his chest in relief before glaring at Chu Ning.  

"Didn't you recognize my voice just now?"  

Chu Ning chuckled. "Honestly, I didn't pay attention."  

Inwardly, however, he mused that the Thorn Vine Technique was indeed quite effective for restraining people. Had he continued channeling the spell, Qiu Shunyi would have been in for a world of pain.  

Qiu Shunyi, meanwhile, looked at him with envy.  

"That's the Thorn Vine Technique, right? I didn’t expect you to master it so quickly."  

Chu Ning gave a light hum of acknowledgment.  

"It's a spell that comes with the Evergreen Wood Art. Once you reach the second layer of Qi Refining and obtain the complete manual, you can start practicing it. How about you? Have you reached the second layer yet?"  

"Heh, I broke through to the second layer last night."  

Qiu Shunyi grinned proudly. Though it had taken him nearly five months, he was still thrilled to have progressed from the first to the second layer.  

After offering his congratulations, Chu Ning learned the purpose of Qiu Shunyi's visit.  

"I came to invite you to the market. Are you interested?"  

"The market?" Chu Ning was slightly surprised.  

To understand the market, one had to consider the geographical layout of the Qingxia Mountain Range, where the Qingxi Sect was located.  

Stretching thousands of miles from east to west and hundreds of miles from north to south, the Qingxia Mountain Range was home to seven sects. The Qingxi Sect was one of the easternmost, while another sect, the Wind Valley Sect, lay about a thousand miles to the west.  

Within this thousand-mile expanse, numerous cultivation families had settled—some affiliated with the Qingxi Sect, others with the Wind Valley Sect. Over time, as these families engaged in trade, markets gradually formed.  

Initially, transactions were small-scale, involving only occasional exchanges between cultivation families. However, as outer disciples of the sects found it inconvenient to trade within the sect, they too began participating in these markets.  

As more people joined, the markets grew in size. Eventually, even major sects like the Qingxi Sect and the Wind Valley Sect established shops there.  

Among the three larger markets spanning the thousand-mile stretch between the two sects, the closest to the Qingxi Sect was the Qinghe Market, located a hundred miles away.  

Chu Ning had heard of these markets before but had never visited one. Thus, Qiu Shunyi's invitation took him slightly by surprise.  

"That's right—the Qinghe Market! It's lively and fun," Qiu Shunyi said enthusiastically. "Senior Brother Shang took me there once before, and last month I went again on my own. I meant to invite you then, but you weren’t around. So today, I made sure to come early."  

Chu Ning was surprised to hear that Qiu Shunyi had already been to the market twice. Curious, he asked,  

"But we don’t have any spirit stones. What’s the point of going?"  

He sighed inwardly. The lack of spirit stones was the main reason he hadn’t visited the market yet.  

Spirit stones were the currency of the cultivation world.  

Unlike inner and outer disciples, who received a monthly stipend, outer disciples of the Qingxi Sect could only earn spirit stones through labor. For Chu Ning, that meant waiting until his spirit rice and ink bamboo matured and were harvested—only then could he exchange the surplus for spirit stones.  

"We might not have any now, but we can still look around," Qiu Shunyi said with a laugh. "Once we do have spirit stones, we’ll know what to buy. Besides, staying here farming all day gets boring. It’ll be fun to stroll around the market and see the sights."  

Chu Ning found himself tempted. After all, he hadn’t left the sect grounds since arriving months ago.  

Just as he was about to agree, he hesitated and asked, "Is it safe?"  

"Absolutely!" Qiu Shunyi replied immediately. "The Qinghe Market is only a hundred miles from us. No one would dare cause trouble for Qingxi Sect disciples so close to home. Oh, and if we’re lucky, we might even catch a ride on a flying boat with a senior brother or uncle heading out. Did you know? The sect waives the fee for new disciples’ first six rides on the flying boats. Of course, we probably won’t be as lucky on the way back, so we’ll have to return on foot."  

Reassured, Chu Ning followed Qiu Shunyi out.  

They arrived at a large square within the sect’s outer gates.  

This square marked the boundary of the Qingxi Sect’s outer territory, located near the mountain’s base. Deeper into the Qingxia Mountain Range lay the sect’s inner grounds, accessible only to outer disciples. Chu Ning had yet to visit that area.  

Several people were already waiting in the square. Qiu Shunyi introduced one of them—Lü Xingyuan, his current neighbor and a fellow new disciple—to Chu Ning.  

Chu Ning often crossed paths with his own neighbors, Qi Chongmao and his companion, but he preferred solitude and focused on cultivation, limiting their interactions to brief greetings. Qiu Shunyi, on the other hand, was as sociable as ever and had quickly befriended his neighbors.  

The reason everyone was waiting instead of leaving immediately, Qiu Shunyi explained, was that lingering here increased their chances of catching a ride on a higher-grade flying boat heading out. The return trip, however, would depend on luck—if no boat was available, they’d have to rely on their own wind-riding techniques and return early.  

After chatting for a while, an elder from the sect arrived on a flying boat. The group bowed respectfully and stated their destination. Without further ado, the elder gestured for them to board.  

The boat was smaller than the one that had brought them from Qingxi City but could still accommodate the seven or eight people present.  

The journey took less than half an hour before the boat descended outside an ornate archway.  

As Chu Ning stepped off, he looked up and saw three large characters inscribed on the archway:  

**Qinghe Market.**
