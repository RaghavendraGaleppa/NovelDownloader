# Chapter 537: Beautiful Female Cultivators Are Never Good People

However, as he reached the more central and densely crowded area of the market, a sword placed on an inconspicuous stall instantly captured his attention.

It wasn't because the stall owner was shouting loudly, but because the sword itself faintly emitted the fluctuation of a magic treasure's spiritual rhythm.

This caused him to subconsciously stop in his tracks.

A thought flashed through his mind.

Perhaps I can find a treasure today.

Although he could easily forge magic treasures himself as long as he had sufficient materials, Xu Yunfan wouldn't reject such an opportunity.

While the sword's spiritual rhythm was somewhat obscure and seemed incomplete, even carrying an indescribable sense of tarnish—as if a bright pearl had been obscured by dust—Xu Yunfan's keen perception from his nascent Heaven's Beginning and his extraordinary mental state from the 'Lin' Mantra detected the extraordinary nature of its core.

The sword was about three feet long, with an ancient and unadorned form. The blade was neither gold nor iron, but a dark, pitch-black color, covered in countless fine cracks as tiny as dust motes.

The crossguard and hilt were simple in design, with no excess decoration, exuding an air of long-standing solitude and silence.

The foundation of a top-tier magic treasure?

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred, and he stepped forward, carefully examining it from a step away.

The sword was damaged, and its spirituality seemed impaired, yet the faint fluctuation it still possessed gave Xu Yunfan a strange feeling. Deep within this fluctuation, it seemed to resonate faintly with the trace of the Sword Dao Origin he had comprehended from cultivating the 'Myriad Chariots Sword Art.'

With this感应 (sensing), it must have originated from the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect.

Although the three major sects currently stand in a tripartite balance, their covert battles never cease for a moment. It isn't rare to see swords from the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect within the Primordial Origin Sect.

Just as he was focusing his attention on observing, a gentle, charming voice, like an oriole emerging from a valley, sounded beside him.

"This Junior Brother, are you very interested in this 'Sinking Star' ancient sword?"

Xu Yunfan looked to the side.

He saw the stall owner was a woman with a graceful figure. She wore a fine, light purple flowing cloud robe, its cut perfectly outlining her exquisite curves. A sash adorned with a few lustrous pearls was tied around her waist, further accentuating her slender, delicate waist.

Her skin was like congealed cream, fairer than snow. Her eyes, shaped like a phoenix, shimmered with life. The gaze she fixed on him seemed to contain spring water between her glances, brimming with charm.

This look made a fire of desire uncontrollably rise in Xu Yunfan's heart, but it was suppressed by the 'Lin' Mantra in an instant.

The female cultivator had a straight, delicate nose and naturally red lips. At this moment, she wore a perfectly measured smile—neither overly enthusiastic nor distant.

Three thousand strands of black hair were loosely tied up with a single jade-inlaid hairpin. A few unruly strands fell by her ears, adding a touch of lazy and moving allure.

The magnificence of this woman's appearance and the perfection of her figure were rare among all Xu Yunfan had ever seen.

More importantly, the charm she unintentionally exuded seemed innate. Every movement, every frown and smile, contained a soul-capturing power, like an invisible vortex attracting the attention of almost all the male disciples nearby.

As she spoke, Xu Yunfan could clearly feel that within a dozen or so zhang radius, the breathing of nearly all Qi Condensation male disciples hitched, their breaths becoming noticeably rapid, their minds mostly tied to this woman.

She was like an invisible luminous body, firmly occupying the center of attention in this area.

Xu Yunfan's eyes held a hint of strangeness.

This is interesting.

With his current cultivation and mental state, and having cultivated the 'Lin' Mantra, his mental power far surpassed his peers, even exceeding that of late Foundation Establishment cultivators. He naturally had a strong resistance to such externally released charm power.

More importantly, he was acutely aware of one thing.

This was the Primordial Origin Sect, a place the world called the Primordial Demon Sect.

In this great demonic sect where "big fish eat small fish, and small fish eat shrimp," especially in this mixed and crowded market, there is no such thing as unprovoked kindness, nor any free lunch falling from the sky.

Especially for a female disciple whose cultivation is at least at the peak of late Qi Condensation, possessing such astonishing beauty and charm, to proactively and "kindly" strike up a conversation with an ordinary disciple who appears to others as merely a mid Qi Condensation, unremarkable cultivator?

This itself is a huge flaw.

Using such a method to strike up a conversation clearly shows she is full of confidence in her own appearance.

"Greetings, Senior Sister."

His thoughts raced, and Xu Yunfan's face squeezed out a look of surprise and awkwardness fitting for his current identity. His gaze lingered on the woman's face for a moment before he shyly lowered his head, looking at the ancient sword before him.

"This sword seems rather extraordinary, but it also looks very old and damaged. Please forgive my poor eyesight, Senior Sister, but I don't know its origin?"

The woman smiled, her eyes shimmering, and the air around them seemed to become several times sweeter. "Junior Brother has good eyesight. This 'Sinking Star' ancient sword is indeed the remnant of a magic treasure. It was the佩剑 (佩剑 -佩剑 means sword, but here it's a noun) of a Core Formation expert from the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect. Unfortunately, it was severely damaged in a fierce battle, its spirituality greatly diminished, its power less than a tenth of its former self, and its artifact spirit has long since perished.

If not for this, how could such a treasure end up in a market?"

She sighed with a perfectly measured sense of regret. "I acquired it by chance in an abandoned cultivator's cave. Unfortunately, this sword is incomplete, and to me, it's like a chicken rib—a thing of little value but not worth discarding.

I heard that the风气 (风气 - atmosphere) of artifact refining is flourishing on the Divine Thunder Peak, with many strange and talented individuals. So I thought I'd come here to try my luck, to see if I could find a fated person, or exchange it for some urgently needed cultivation resources to break through to the Core Formation realm."

Her explanation sounded reasonable, and配合 (配合 -配合 means to cooperate or go with) with her convincing appearance and temperament, it was almost flawless.

Unfortunately, standing before her was Xu Yunfan.

Skilled in the 'Lin' Mantra, his soul was powerful, and his perception was terrifyingly keen.

As the woman spoke, a certain aura hidden beneath her myriad charms was innate.

It was a charm technique.

A slut from the Hundred Desires Peak.

This woman was a hook.

Xu Yunfan's thoughts turned, but on the surface, he revealed an even more "enlightened" and "yearning" expression, which then turned into an "empty-pocket" embarrassment.

"I see. However, even though the remnant of a magic treasure is damaged, it isn't a treasure that a small Qi Condensation cultivator like me can covet. The resources required would surely be a sky-high price. Senior Sister, my apologies for the disturbance. I was just looking to broaden my horizons."

As he spoke, he cupped his fists apologetically to the woman, glanced at the female cultivator with a look of reluctance, and turned away, taking only a few steps before merging into the endless stream of people beside him, quickly disappearing from sight.

The woman still wore a smile, watching the direction where Xu Yunfan's figure had vanished, her gaze calm and even. However, a barely perceptible trace of surprise and scrutiny flashed through the depths of her eyes.

He actually managed to get away.

Truly worthy of being a Core Formation expert.

要知道 (要知道 - to know or it should be noted that) other Core Formation experts, upon seeing her, would often feel an instant connection and linger for a long time, wanting to monopolize her.

But then, her infectiously charming smile was once again挂 (挂 - hung) on her face.
