# Chapter 28: The Market

Speaking of the Liu family, their origins are quite extraordinary.

It's said that their ancestor was originally just an ordinary shepherd boy without any spiritual roots. By chance, he stumbled into an immortal's cave dwelling, obtained its inheritance, consumed the spiritual pills inside, and gained the ability to cultivate.

Thus, he somewhat haphazardly embarked on the path of immortality.

There are many stories of mortals accidentally entering ancient cultivators' caves and beginning their cultivation journey. But cases like the Liu family ancestor—someone with no innate talent who managed to reverse their fate through treasures—are unheard of. 

Treasures that can enable mortals to cultivate are something no one in the entire Tianmu Mountain region has ever heard of. After the Liu family was established, many forces tried to investigate openly and secretly. Despite the Liu family repeatedly insisting they possessed no such treasure, suspicions persisted until they were forced to seek the Qingheng Sect's intervention. 

They publicly declared that if they truly had any treasure capable of enabling ordinary people to cultivate, they would immediately offer it to the Qingheng Sect. The sect's Golden Core elder personally investigated and found nothing. Only then did the rumors surrounding the Liu family finally die down.

Nowadays, what the Liu family is most known for is their refining technique. 

This refining technique isn't alchemy, but rather a unique family spell that allows them to remove impurities from medicinal herbs, improving their quality. Though the improvement is only by 10-20%, this technique has allowed the Liu family to thrive in the Tianmu Mountain region.

Because of this, the Liu family has always been eager to nurture their own spirit plant cultivators. Establishing an in-house cultivation and refining system would allow them to maximize profits. 

Unfortunately, while spirit plant cultivation isn't considered a particularly prestigious profession, it's still difficult for an ordinary family without prior experience to train one. The main reason is that spirit plant cultivation is a knowledge-intensive field, often requiring accumulated experience over generations.

Unlike alchemy or artifact forging—where mastering a single pill or item can qualify someone as a practitioner—spirit plant cultivators must be able to care for a wide variety of medicinal plants. After all, a medicinal garden can't just grow one type of herb.

When Liu Changfeng mentioned that Zhang Yan could choose something from the Liu family's treasury, Zhang Yan couldn't help but feel excited. He wondered if he might stumble upon a hidden treasure. 

He wasn't necessarily expecting to find the legendary item that enabled the Liu ancestor to cultivate, but even the refining technique alone was highly appealing. However, without knowing the full situation, he could only wait until after the medicinal garden was restored to see what opportunities might arise.

With Liu Changfeng's approval, the Liu family's spirit plant garden immediately began renovations. 

Zhang Yan carefully transplanted each medicinal herb to a temporary location. After completing the relocation, he discussed his plans for reorganizing the garden with Liu Changfeng, who then assigned workers to carry out the tasks. 

This left Zhang Yan with some free time. 

Due to the Liu family head's generosity, Zhang Yan occasionally took the time to teach the Liu siblings about spirit plant cultivation. Notably, Liu Yiting, the younger sister, had also learned the Wood Essence Art—a single-target spell particularly suited for tending to medicinal plants. This showed her genuine interest in mastering the art of spirit plant cultivation.

A month passed in the blink of an eye. 

During this time, Zhang Yan's cultivation advanced once again—from the second layer of Qi Refining to the third. 

His Equipment Bar also unlocked a fourth slot. 

"More options for combinations now," Zhang Yan thought with satisfaction, though he also felt a hint of concern. 

The reason was simple: he had too few usable equipment pieces. He urgently needed to acquire more. 

When the Liu family head learned of Zhang Yan's breakthrough, he sent someone to congratulate him and even gifted him several talismans—including a high-grade Movement Talisman and five mid-grade Fireball Talismans. 

The Movement Talisman, when applied to oneself or a mount, could enable travel of a thousand li in a day. Due to the constraints of spiritual energy and the high cost of flying artifacts, most family cultivators or wandering practitioners relied on spells, talismans, or—for the more affluent—family-owned spirit beasts for transportation. Those who possessed their own flying artifacts were exceedingly rare. 

Though these talismans weren't particularly valuable, given Zhang Yan's limited resources as a new cultivator, they still strengthened his foundation.

Half a month later, the garden renovations were nearing completion. 

One day, Liu Yiting approached Zhang Yan. 

"Honored Master, the family head mentioned that we'll be visiting the Qingheng Market in a few days. Would you like to join us?" Though Liu Yiting was slightly older and of similar cultivation level, she always treated Zhang Yan with the utmost respect, considering herself his junior. 

The reason was simple: Zhang Yan was a disciple of the Qingheng Sect, while she was merely a family disciple. The gap between their statuses was immense. 

"I'd appreciate it if you could inform the family head to include me in the trip," Zhang Yan replied. Though the Qingheng Sect had its own market, it was small and lacked variety. The Qingheng Market, on the other hand, gathered cultivators from all the families and wandering practitioners of Tianmu Mountain, offering countless treasures. He was certain to find useful items there. 

"Your wish is my command, Honored Master," Liu Yiting said before hurrying off to relay the message.

Three days later, Zhang Yan packed his belongings and set off for the market with Liu Changfeng and the others. 

It was clear that the Liu family took these market trips seriously. The group was led by a Foundation Establishment elder—though he appeared quite aged—along with five late-stage Qi Refining disciples and over a dozen early-stage Qi Refining disciples. 

Liu Changfeng specifically instructed the elder to take good care of Zhang Yan. 

Since the Liu family didn't own a flying vessel, they traveled via spirit beasts—specifically, Great Antler Deer. These snow-white deer, distinguished by their large antlers, could cover three thousand li in a day or one thousand li at night. As first-grade lower-tier spirit beasts (equivalent to early Qi Refining), they were considered valuable assets to the Liu family. 

Normally, three people shared one deer, but given Zhang Yan's status, he was assigned his own mount. 

Admittedly, riding a deer was far less comfortable than traveling by flying boat or vessel. Still, it was a novel experience. 

With over a dozen people in their group—including a Foundation Establishment elder—they encountered no dangers along the way and arrived safely at the Qingheng Market. 

Contrary to expectations, the market was enormous, resembling a small city from afar. 

"It seems I won't be leaving empty-handed," Zhang Yan mused, pleased at the prospect.
