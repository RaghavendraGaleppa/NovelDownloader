# Chapter 73: Rebirth in Light

On Crimson Cloud Mountain, at the Thunder-Flame Alchemical Palace, lightning interwoven and fireballs rolled across the bright, glistening tiles, a spectacle that drew many nobles' exclamations of wonder.

On the other side, sounds of weeping arose as some family members came to claim bodies, their faces showing unconcealable sorrow.

"This fellow doesn't seem like a good person; he deliberately let the corpses absorb more Heavenly Light and spiritual substances inside."

Not far away, two people whispered, glancing at the corpse collector, Qin Ming's "retriever." As fellow practitioners, they were well aware of the tricks of the trade.

"That's a bit much."

"Huh, wait, look! The corpse he pulled out doesn't seem very damaged, almost like the first batch that was pulled out."

Both showed surprise and immediately moved closer to examine it carefully.

The clouds in the sky were thick, with lightning flashing and thunder rumbling. On the ground, crimson light steamed, and the entire mountain was not dark; in fact, it was quite bright. It was clearly visible that Qin Ming had "died" terribly, his exposed skin completely blackened.

Actually, he had deliberately blackened himself; his true appearance was unrecognizable.

When Xu Hai saw the seemingly complete corpse, his heart sank. Had he, by delaying, stifled a heaven-gifted prodigy? He had only slowly pulled the rope after the sixth descent of Heavenly Light, and the seventh Heavenly Light seemed to have also brushed this person slightly.

"Xu Hai, were you too slow? This person is quite formidable, able to withstand Thunder-Flame Heavenly Light!" someone spoke up.

Xu Hai's expression was calm as he said, "What are you thinking? I had already pulled him out of the main entrance of the Golden Palace in advance; it's just that I didn't pull him back immediately."

Someone next to him nodded and said, "That's true. His age doesn't seem to be great; one or two Heavenly Lights would be enough to make him explode."

Qin Ming remembered the name Xu Hai. This person was purely spouting nonsense. If it were anyone else being tormented like this in the Thunder-Flame Alchemical Palace, they would certainly die. He had long since pushed the secret art of "Harmonizing Light with Dust" to its extreme; right now, he was no different from a corpse.

Qin Ming sighed in his heart. This area was full of "acquaintances." Old Zhao, seventy-two years old, was at least eighty percent cooked, and his body still hadn't been fully pieced together. Apart from a group of old men seeking to "return to spring from withered wood," everyone else came here due to their own difficulties. If given a choice, no young and strong person would be willing to risk their life here. Some came because they had enemies who pushed them into despair, some were bullied and oppressed to the point where they couldn't live anymore, and some were originally death row inmates.

Earthly light steamed, fine rain misted, and the penetrating sound of a suona rang out. Then some coffins were carried up the mountain, accompanied by bursts of weeping. These were the family members of the prominent old men who came to claim the bodies and take them back.

Xu Hai found a relatively clean black cloth to wrap Qin Ming and carried him down the mountain. Qin Ming thought to himself, fortunately, Xu Hai was quite professional in this regard; he didn't casually discard the "corpse." Otherwise, he would definitely have to "play dead" a second time.

But he soon changed his mind!

"Old Xu, how do you sell this Thunder Meat? It looks quite complete; give it to me. I'll help you deliver it to a noble's mansion." Before even descending the mountain, someone approached Xu Hai. Clearly, similar transactions had taken place before.

Xu Hai said, "This is a prime medicinal body! I let him 'settle' there for quite some time; he received at least six or seven waves of Heavenly Light and rare spiritual substances."

"Stop lying!"

"Don't believe me then. Moreover, I don't plan to sell this Thunder Meat whole this time. If you want, I can sell you a few jin. After all, the employer paid a high price; I can't really lose the corpse. Kidneys, heart, you pick."

Qin Ming was deeply surprised to actually encounter such man-eating "demons and monsters."

Xu Hai carried Qin Ming down the mountain. Four groups of people successively found him, expressing their desire to buy a few jin, and had already begun haggling. During this process, Qin Ming, unable to bear it any longer, quietly pressed the "Yellow Mud Palm" onto Xu Hai's back—a technique he had never used on people before. The soft force was very subtle and wouldn't immediately erupt; only after a few days would this person cough blood.

Soon, Qin Ming's body began to heat up continuously. He felt that if he delayed any longer, there would be a risk of exposure. The mixed Thunderfire and Heavenly Light had nurtured special spiritual substances, which were now beginning to take effect. His fourth rebirth had officially begun.

"Let me tell you, this time it's not those old farts. This is a young man with tender skin. If you don't believe me, come and feel him. His body hasn't stiffened yet, and it even has warmth."

"Xu Hai, what are you doing!" Xu Sheng arrived, his entire body covered by a black robe. He was furious. Fortunately, he hadn't waited at the foot of the mountain; otherwise, his "brother's" corpse would have been sold off. With a bang, he kicked Xu Hai flying, took Qin Ming over, and quickly carried him down the mountain.

After Wu Zheng saw this at the foot of the mountain, he immediately cried out mournfully, "Alas, Brother Qin, may you have a good journey. I hope you reincarnate into a wealthy family in your next life, preferably a thousand-year-old aristocratic family. That way, you won't have to struggle so hard."

Xu Sheng also sighed and said, "Little Qin didn't listen to advice, dying young. It's truly regrettable!"

Soon, he felt something was off. Why was his back getting hotter and hotter? At the same time, he heard a very faint whisper: "Brother Xu, find a secluded place."

Xu Sheng's hand trembled; he almost threw the "corpse" away.

"He's reanimated?!" Wu Zheng's eyes widened.

Not long after, Qin Ming washed his face clean with clear water in the dense forest and changed into a new set of clothes.

"I actually saw someone who endured the impact of Heavenly Light and didn't die, and walked out of the Thunder-Flame Alchemical Palace alive!" Xu Sheng was deeply shaken.

Wu Zheng was dumbfounded. Then he said excitedly, "Brother Qin, you're truly divine! To be able to come out alive from that pile of dead bodies!"

"Let's talk about it back at the inn!" Qin Ming left first. His body was scalding hot, almost smoking; he needed to quickly return to the inn.

Not long after, he finished bathing, completely washing away the ashes, but soon he was enveloped by white mist again. This time, his transformation was extremely violent. Besides the heaven-bestowed spiritual substances, a considerable amount of Heavenly Light had also entered his body, raging and surging throughout his entire body, almost making him burn up.

At this moment, Qin Ming couldn't suppress it with any secret art. He began to guide it with the Rebirth Art from the silk manuscript, sorting out the chaotic and disordered light beams. It must be said, the Heavenly Light from the outside world was too domineering. Like molten iron, it felt as if it would burn a person through; ordinary people truly couldn't withstand it.

It wasn't the first time Qin Ming had been eroded by Heavenly Light, but this time, the total amount of Heavenly Light was too much, making even him feel overwhelmed. He drank a large amount of cold water, but white mist continued to steam from his entire body.

Wu Zheng spoke, "Brother Qin is going to become an immortal, it seems. It feels like he's ascending on clouds and riding mist. The demeanor of an otherworldly being is probably just like this."

"That's Heavenly Light surging, making him feel as if he's returning to his mother's womb, or being born from light. His rebirth is far more intense than an ordinary person's!" Xu Sheng exclaimed in admiration.

Soon, both of them exited the courtyard that Qin Ming had specifically rented at the inn for his rebirth, feeling it was inappropriate to watch further.

"I don't even know if I should thank Xu Hai or scold him," Qin Ming muttered. The Heavenly Light within his body was exceptionally dense. Enduring intense pain, he sorted out the Heavenly Light from the outside world and merged it with the Heavenly Light born from his own physical body, becoming 'you in me, I in you,' transforming into a brand new Heavenly Light, undergoing gradual qualitative change.

Qin Ming gathered all the Heavenly Light towards his abdomen, compressing it infinitely like a ball of light, merging it to the extreme, forcing it to transform. That area became increasingly radiant. Then, he released that dazzling round orb, allowing it to erupt chaotically again. The Heavenly Light transformed into thousands of strands, rushing into his flesh, bones, and internal organs, like raging flames burning. This was like a massive explosion of Heavenly Light.

Doing this was extremely dangerous; one could lose their life at any moment. However, the Rebirth Art on the silk manuscript was recorded exactly like this. One could foresee even more dangerous processes later on. Qin Ming heard a sound like a tsunami in his ears; that was the Heavenly Light expanding and erupting fiercely, making his consciousness hazy, as if he was about to be washed away and collapse. It was clearly a rebirth, yet it felt like experiencing a death tribulation!

Qin Ming somewhat doubted that the few people who researched and created the silk manuscript art were completely intending for their successors to walk on the line between life and death. Probably not a few successors had died. Otherwise, this Rebirth Art on the silk manuscript wouldn't have been abandoned by later generations and swept into the dust of history. This went against the original intention of the few creators of the art. They wanted to shatter the cage and forge a new path, but the result was proven to be not as easy as the existing paths.

Finally, Qin Ming's eyes regained clarity. He had endured it.

"The art on the silk manuscript is too dangerous, but as long as one can withstand it and pass through alive, the power gained is indeed strong enough. One's physical quality is a significant step above other reborn individuals."

Qin Ming continuously fused the Heavenly Light nine times, compressed them, and then allowed them to erupt violently again. By the ninth time, the ball of light within him was already very small, returning to primal unity. The Heavenly Light from the outside world and the Heavenly Light from his body had assimilated, undergoing a complete qualitative change.

After a short rest, Qin Ming went to practice several newly acquired Heavenly Light force arts.

The Soft Force, originated from an ancient book from Golden Rooster Ridge, was a composite Heavenly Light force art, the foundation of the Yellow Mud Palm. He had already thoroughly understood it and knew how to practice it; what he lacked was only the total amount of Heavenly Light. Today, he had been "infused" with outside Heavenly Light in the Thunder-Flame Alchemical Palace, the effect even stronger than consuming the Three-Colored Flower. As he practiced Soft Force again, he continuously elevated its level.

The feeling of practicing the force art like this was truly wonderful. Qin Ming was immersed in it, unable to extricate himself. He completely perfected the Soft Force, and the power of his Yellow Mud Palm increased explosively.

After that, he went to practice the Hammer Force and Whip Force from the newly acquired hammer technique book. Similarly, there was no longer any stagnation. As the Heavenly Light force was elevated, both force arts also reached perfection. Qin Ming unexpectedly discovered that the mysterious Explosive Force he obtained from the Thunder-Flame Alchemical Palace was incredibly compatible with the Hammer Force and Whip Force, as if they were originally one. When all three Heavenly Light forces were mastered, they automatically merged into one. When he practiced that hammer technique again, its power actually increased significantly.

"In the past, when I wielded the long-handled dark gold hammer on Black and White Mountain, what I actually displayed was a blade technique. It could be called 'Hammer-Blade'." Now Qin Ming drew his mutton-fat jade iron blade and performed the hammer technique, which could be called "Blade-Hammer"!

Finally, all the force arts he had mastered merged into his original Heavenly Light force art, causing it to transform again, and its power significantly increased! He could still use Soft Force, Intercepting Force, Explosive Force, etc., separately, but once they all merged into one, that would be revealing his trump card, releasing a force that could destroy everything in its path.

In the inn, Xu Sheng and Wu Zheng were both astonished to hear the thunderous sounds coming from Qin Ming's courtyard.

"No wonder Little Qin was so low-key this time, deceiving everyone, and even wanted to enter the Thunder-Flame Alchemical Palace a second time. He indeed possesses talents that ordinary people cannot hope to match," Xu Sheng sighed.

A wave of drowsiness swept over him, but Qin Ming did not immediately fall asleep. Instead, he sat quietly in his room. He knew that once he woke up, his world might be completely different.
