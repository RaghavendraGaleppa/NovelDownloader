# Chapter 128: The War Begins

Not long after, a kestrel flew swiftly from a civilian house toward Cuibo City.

In the courtyard of a civilian house within the Cuibo Tower, the purple-robed elder looked at the information sent by the kestrel, a glint of hatred flashing in his eyes. "Disciple, he will soon come to keep you company in death."

At Cuibo Tower by the edge of Cuibo Lake, after Yan Yuwei presented the Tiangong Cave token, she naturally was led to a private room on the third floor.

Seeing Xu Yunfan’s surprise, Yan Yuwei explained, "Senior Brother Xu may not know, but Cuibo Tower is an industry managed by the Outer Affairs Hall. Inner disciples can come here at any time."

Xu Yunfan understood.

Sitting opposite Yan Yuwei, once the dishes were served, Yan Yuwei skillfully sliced a piece of fish sashimi as thin as a cicada's wing using a fish-tail knife.

"Does Senior Brother Xu know the marvel of this fish?"

With a light flick of her wrist, the slice of fish landed precisely on the ice jade plate in front of Xu Yunfan. "Half an hour after leaving the water, the meat will spontaneously curl into a ring, completely losing its spiritual nature and vitality. The Cuibo Lake stretches for a hundred miles, and this fish can only be eaten here. The Outer Affairs Hall even keeps a team of fishermen skilled in catching spiritual fish specifically for this purpose."

Xu Yunfan picked up a piece and put it in his mouth, his eyes brightening slightly.

"The taste is excellent."

Moreover, a cool, thread-like sensation rapidly flowed from his stomach throughout his limbs, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye. If eaten for a long time, it could repair hidden injuries for martial artists and prolong life.

Unfortunately, it was useless to him; he was just enjoying the pleasure of his taste buds.

Every time the attribute panel enhanced him, it washed away all his hidden injuries, purifying his flesh and blood and adjusting his body to a perfect state.

Seeing this, Yan Yuwei finally let out a sigh of relief and asked, "I wonder what important matter Senior Brother Xu has for inviting me today?"

She wasn't foolish. Who in the Tiangong Cave didn't know that Xu Yunfan was obsessed with martial arts and wouldn't even waste half an hour? For a meal like this...

He hadn't even invited his own master, let alone her.

Could it be that he actually liked her?

Yan Yuwei felt uneasy, and she couldn't help but think wildly. She had heard that these outstanding geniuses always had some strange quirks; maybe he was into this kind of thing.

If that were really the case, should she agree immediately, or act reserved?

"Senior Sister Yan is perceptive."

Xu Yunfan put down his chopsticks and said, "To be honest, the method of forging weapons has already been put on the right track under my master's leadership. However, my master said that if forging wants to be more perfect, one must naturally be familiar with the characteristics of various ores."

"So I wanted to ask Junior Sister to teach me the Melting Gold Forging Art of the Melting Gold Hall."

Although the Scripture Pavilion had records of the Melting Gold Forging Art, the core techniques—drawing Gold Essence into flesh and blood, using it over the years to distinguish the characteristics of ore veins, and even cultivating a body of metal—were not recorded. Only the head of the Melting Gold Hall or true disciples could practice it.

Even the inner disciples of the Melting Gold Hall did not practice it but cultivated another core method of the Melting Gold Hall.

It wasn't that they wouldn't teach it; it was just that without the corresponding talent and physique, practicing it recklessly would cause the body to mutate and kill the practitioner.

The Tiangong Cave had naturally had related accidents in the past, so they sealed the martial arts of each hall in the lower levels. Aside from the hall head, others who wanted to view it needed the hall head's approval.

Zhan Yan would definitely not agree. In his view, Xu Yunfan had a natural talent, and he didn't want to waste it. Practicing the martial arts of other halls was truly a waste of time and not a proper business.

"I see."

Yan Yuwei breathed a sigh of relief and was about to speak when the sound of rotten wood groaning under weight suddenly came from the staircase, drawing the attention of the two.

The door to the third-floor private room was violently pushed open by a strong surge of qi. The purple-robed elder leaned on a snake-headed cane as he stepped onto the final step. The copper rings at the bottom of the cane collided with the floorboards with a dull thud as he looked at Xu Yunfan and Yan Yuwei.

But the vast majority of his attention was on Xu Yunfan.

The wrinkles on his face seemed to be embedded with iron sand, with black spots covering his features. When he smiled, it sounded like rusted hinges grinding.

"Young Hero Xu, you have made me search hard for you. To find you, I have almost worn my old bones out."

The visitor was not friendly.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. Hearing the hostility in the other party's words, he naturally wouldn't be polite. He said with some surprise, "Oh, Elder, what do you seek me for? Why not find a place to enjoy your retirement? Running around everywhere, you might die halfway, and perhaps your sons and grandsons would have the trouble of carrying you back."

"Sharp-tongued."

A trace of resentment and undisguised killing intent appeared on the purple-robed elder's face.

"Do you remember outside Dingbei City in Wuzhou, when you severed my disciple's spine? Did you ever think someone would come for revenge today?"

Xu Yunfan was about to speak when his nostrils flared slightly, and the expression on his face quickly turned cold.

He slowly stood up, his right hand gripping the handle of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer beside him. Seeing this, Yan Yuwei's heart tightened. She glanced at Xu Yunfan and grabbed the long-handled mechanical greatsword leaning against the wall.

"I was wondering who it was. It turns out to be an old dog from the Incense Fire Sect."

Xu Yunfan showed a hint of realization, a cold light flashing in his eyes.

"That day, your good disciple was waving an eighteen-foot snake spear at infants. I killed him too easily; I should have crushed his bones one by one to be truly satisfying."

Yan Yuwei secretly cursed inwardly. Xu Yunfan's words were practically adding fuel to the fire.

This purple-robed elder had a strange figure, broad shoulders and a long waist, and his large hands were purplish-black. He was clearly a高手 of the Flesh Refining Realm who had refined his form. She was only a Three-Training Martial Teacher realm cultivator, not even reaching One-Training perfection. How could she fight across realms?

Moreover...

Yan Yuwei glanced behind the purple-robed elder. The dense crowd of black-clad men almost filled the staircase.

Was this guy a calamity magnet? He runs into this kind of thing the moment he comes out.

Yan Yuwei wanted to curse.

"Everything you just said, I will return to you bit by bit."

The elder's purple robe moved without wind, revealing a nine-section steel whip at his waist. The whip sections were covered in barbs, and the tips of each thorn glowed with a dark blue hue.

"Do you know that the thirty-two cities of Wuzhou have all been slaughtered? The flesh and blood soaked the ground, turning it a blood-red. You ran fast, came to Cangzhou, entered the Tiangong Cave, and made me wait bitterly."

Xu Yunfan felt a surge of anger rising in his chest, hard to suppress. If he hadn't gone to Wuzhou, it would have been fine; he could just listen and it wouldn't matter. After all, as a transmigrator, he truly couldn't empathize.

But he had seen, heard, and encountered it. When encountering these Incense Fire Sect members, if he could beat them, he would naturally eliminate them on the spot.

In an instant, the steel whip moved with the purple-robed elder's large hand. Amidst the tearing sound of air, the tip of Xu Yunfan's retreating nose brushed past a barb. His face showed no panic. His abdominal muscles contracted violently, pulling his body straight in an instant. The next moment, his abdominal muscles undulated like waves, and his entire body leaped over the Eight Immortals table from below.

The table legs were swept by the whip tip, and the wood splinters exploded like shotgun pellets, deeply embedding themselves into the pillar behind.

*Crack!*

The elder's purplish-black palm shattered the window lattice, his five fingers clawing at Xu Yunfan's throat.

As Xu Yunfan's Adam's apple rolled, it suddenly swelled by half an inch, actually using the trapezius muscle on the side of his neck to clamp the other party's thumb.

He wanted to test just how far a Three-Training perfection Martial Teacher realm could go. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in his hand was not used first.

The moment the two locked strength, the nine-section whip, like a python turning over, coiled onto the房梁. The entire crossbeam groaned under the unbearable weight.

At this time, Yan Yuwei retreated a step, knocking over a screen. The greatsword in her hand moved like the wind, clanging as it instantly shattered the plain sabers of three black-clad men.

The blade fragments embedded in her forearm muscles were squeezed out by her tense brachioradialis, producing a sound of metal clashing.
