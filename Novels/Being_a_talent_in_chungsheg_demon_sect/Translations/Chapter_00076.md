**Chapter 76**

“As expected, the prettier the woman, the more deceitful she is.”

Lu Yang watched Liu Xin’s tragic fate in this life, poisoned by Yu Suzhen and ultimately drained dry by her demonic art. A surge of delight filled his heart: *‘That’s what you get for harming me in my second life.’*

Immediately after, Lu Yang turned his gaze to Yu Suzhen. Without revealing himself, he cast an illusion spell, swapping out the Innate Primordial Qi Myriad Spirit Banner.

As for the *Innate Daoist Scripture*, Lu Yang left a copy for Yu Suzhen, but he removed all content related to the Myriad Spirit Banner and instead inserted the Heaven-Stealing Art. The outcome was exactly as he expected: when Yu Suzhen saw this secret art, she was almost instantly captivated.

“The Heaven-Stealing Art… as long as one spars with someone, they can seize their cultivation and qi luck…”

Yu Suzhen’s eyes burned with fervor as she pored over the Heaven-Stealing Art’s contents, feeling as if this cultivation technique was tailor-made for her!

Thinking of this, Yu Suzhen’s ambition instantly surged.

If before she merely harbored the aspiration of immortal cultivation and longevity but didn’t know how to achieve it, now she had found a method.

After all, to Yu Suzhen, this was far easier than traditional cultivation.

With her aptitude, it had taken her so long in the Joyful Union Palace just to break through to the first layer of Qi Refining. Even if she lived her entire life, she would likely only reach the third layer of Qi Refining.

However, if she could cultivate this Heaven-Stealing Art, with her beauty, she could simply cast a wide net, catch many fish, specifically target talented cultivators, build a large ‘fish pond,’ and collect their cultivation. Her progress would surely advance by leaps and bounds! Even Foundation Establishment wouldn’t be impossible!

The more Yu Suzhen thought about it, the more her heart blazed with excitement.

Immediately after, she used Corpse-Dissolving Water to dispose of Liu Xin’s body, followed by the young disciple’s body, meticulously cleaning up the scene.

Three months later, inside a cave dwelling.

“Bitch! You poisoned me?!”

Yu Suzhen showed no interest in responding to the man, who was now battered and on the verge of collapse.

For a time, the man’s shrill screams echoed throughout the cave dwelling.

Just like that, the man’s body shriveled up at a visible rate, while Yu Suzhen’s complexion grew increasingly rosy.

*Rumble!*

With a soft crack, Yu Suzhen’s qi presence suddenly surged, forcefully breaking through the bottleneck of the third layer of Qi Refining and reaching the mid-stage of Qi Refining.

At this moment, Yu Suzhen even appeared somewhat sacred, nourished by the true qi.

Lu Yang, hidden nearby, witnessed the entire process.

In just three short months, he had watched Yu Suzhen spar with various disciples, advancing from the first layer of Qi Refining to the third, and then successively plundering their cultivation.

*Cultivate to become stronger!*

Yu Suzhen was even meticulous about her reputation, only engaging in clandestine affairs. Publicly, she maintained a persona of cold arrogance, never showing favoritism to any man.

The colder and more arrogant Yu Suzhen appeared, the more people fell for her act.

Thus, in merely three months, Yu Suzhen had lured in many unfortunate fools blinded by lust, then completely drained them using the Heaven-Stealing Art.

“Looking at it this way, if it weren’t for my Pestilent Death Whisper killing her in the first life, she would have killed Liu Xin. Even without the Heaven-Stealing Art, she would have obtained the *Innate Daoist Scripture* and the Myriad Spirit Banner, and perhaps still soared, transforming people’s qi luck. The changes in cause and effect are truly profound.”

“Regardless, the bait has been cast.”

Without a doubt, Yu Suzhen possessed potential.

She was ruthless, venomous, and shameless; she would do anything beneficial to herself. She was practically a born disciple of the Saint Sect.

She merely lacked an opportunity.

And now, Lu Yang had given her that opportunity, allowing her to grow rapidly. More importantly, if this continued, she would eventually encounter Xiao Shiye.

Lu Yang wanted to see if she could tempt Xiao Shiye.

If she could truly spar with Xiao Shiye, he would make a huge profit, because Xiao Shiye would, in the future, catch the Rainbow Merit Fish from the Pool of Merit!

If he could use Yu Suzhen to transform Xiao Shiye into a puppet of the Heaven-Stealing Art, then when Xiao Shiye caught the Rainbow Merit Fish and consumed it for refinement, he could suddenly activate the art, thereby substituting one for another, using Yu Suzhen as a transfer point to steal all of the Rainbow Merit Fish’s cultivation and qi luck!

Daoist Hongyun used Xiao Shiye as bait to catch the Merit Fish.

He, on the other hand, would use Yu Suzhen as bait to ‘steal the donkey’!

This plan was akin to snatching food from a tiger’s mouth. It was clear that if it succeeded, it would infuriate True Immortal Hongyun, who would spare no expense to investigate.

“So I need to hide far away…”

Taking the Myriad Spirit Banner, Lu Yang observed Yu Suzhen for a few more days. Once he confirmed everything was in order, he quietly left the Saint Sect and swiftly journeyed towards the mortal world.

Remaining in the Saint Sect offered a hundred disadvantages and no benefits.

After all, he was officially dead. Staying in the Saint Sect would only mean hiding in the shadows, silently waiting for ‘Death and Rebirth’ and Yu Suzhen’s cultivation to progress.

That would be too much of a waste of time.

“Yu Suzhen is my most important scheme in this life, but not my only one. After all, even if I cultivate the Heaven-Stealing Art and the Grand Yin Metamorphosis Corpse Disintegration True Art, along with the Sage’s Plunder and Third-Grade True Qi, I only have a forty percent chance of breaking through to Foundation Establishment. I must find other ways to secure it.”

“Moreover, being far away has its benefits.”

“Because once Yu Suzhen’s matter succeeds and a Foundation Establishment True Immortal becomes enraged and traces the cause and effect, me hiding in the Saint Sect would be no different from seeking death.”

“But if I’m far away, even if a Foundation Establishment True Immortal is furious, it will still take time for them to track me down.”

“This time difference will be enough for me to attempt Foundation Establishment.”

Lu Yang would not pin his hopes on ‘possibly not being discovered.’ After all, in his previous life, Old Ancestor Yun had managed to divine his whereabouts using a Heavenly Scrying Device.

He would only consider the worst-case scenario.

As for Yu Suzhen, Lu Yang only needed to periodically deduce cause and effect, observe her, and ensure her actions didn’t stray from his control.

After leaving the Saint Sect, Lu Yang felt as if the sky was vast for birds to fly and the sea wide for fish to leap.

“My corpse is hidden within the Myriad Spirit Banner. This wondrous treasure contains its own universe, and only it can house my transforming corpse, allowing me to carry it with me.”

Besides that, the Myriad Spirit Banner held another opportunity that excited him.

Lu Yang chanted a spell, unfurling the banner. Instantly, black smoke billowed forth, and then a handsome young man in a black robe stepped down from the banner.

It was Chen Xinan, the true disciple of the Saint Sect.

In his previous life, to verify the effect of the Innate Primordial Chaos One Qi Divine Talisman in obscuring heavenly secrets, and also because his cultivation was too low at the time, making him feel unable to control the other party, he hadn’t kept Chen Xinan. But now it was different. Having cultivated the Sage’s Plunder and now possessing a certain ‘status,’ Lu Yang was brimming with confidence.

“Where is this?”

Having just emerged from the Myriad Spirit Banner, Chen Xinan seemed disoriented. He instinctively looked for Liu Xin’s figure, then frowned.

“…Liu Xin is dead?”

Chen Xinan pondered for a moment, then his brows relaxed. He turned to Lu Yang: “Which sect’s disciple are you? Did you kill Liu Xin?”

“Yes,” Lu Yang nodded, showing no change in expression.

Unlike in his previous life, where Chen Xinan had recognized him as a Saint Sect disciple with just a glance, this time Chen Xinan had no reaction.

Lu Yang knew why: in this life, he hadn’t lit a life lamp in the Primal Saint Sect, instead using an illusion spell to deceive them. Furthermore, his main cultivation technique was now the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art*, not a secret art of the Primal Saint Sect, which caused Chen Xinan to misjudge him for a moment.
