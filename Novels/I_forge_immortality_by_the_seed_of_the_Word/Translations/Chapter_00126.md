# Chapter 124: Promotion to the Inner Court

Three streaks of rainbow light streaked across the sky, descending deep into the Dragon Marsh Lake.

Before long.

A small island merely several dozen zhang in circumference came into Zhang Jing's view.

Enshrouded in mist and dense spiritual energy.

Rather than calling it an island, it was more like a palace floating upon the rippling emerald waters.

Ancient yet exuding an aura of spirituality.

With cyan tiles and walls shimmering with spiritual light, it formed a harmonious whole with its reflection in the water.

"That is where the Flowing Light Immortal Wall is located,"

Beside him.

The Academy Head, who had deliberately slowed his flight speed to accommodate Zhang Jing, explained gently.

"There? This disciple understands."

Zhang Jing nodded.

The Flowing Light Immortal Wall?

A glimmer of curiosity flashed in his eyes.

What kind of treasure was this?

If he remembered correctly, even the legendary True Spirit Ranking seemed to be housed within the Flowing Light Immortal Wall.

The rainbow lights touched down.

As the three arrived, the palace doors silently swung open of their own accord.

But then someone walked out from within.

"Senior Brother You?"

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened.

"Academy Head, Pavilion Master, and Junior Brother Zhang Jing."

You Yuanming smiled and nodded, appearing unsurprised by their arrival.

"How did it go? What's your ranking on the True Spirit Ranking this time, Yuanming?"

Beside Zhang Jing.

The Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master, who had been silent as if deep in thought, immediately looked at You Yuanming with anticipation.

As the words fell.

The Academy Head's gaze also settled on You Yuanming, eyes filled with hope.

"Yuanming, did you make it into the top two hundred?"

Hearing this.

A bitter smile appeared on You Yuanming's face as he clasped his hands apologetically.

"Ah... I've failed the expectations of the Academy Head and Pavilion Master. I only reached rank two hundred seventy-six."

"Two hundred seventy-six is fine. After all, your Dao Foundation has just undergone transformation, and there are still over two years before the Upper Realm opens. Once you've fully mastered your Golden Nature Dao Foundation in two years, you should be able to break into the top two hundred."

The Academy Head comforted with a smile.

Meanwhile.

A trace of regret flashed through the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master's heart, though none showed on his face as he similarly encouraged:

"Don't be disheartened, Yuanming. Your current situation is special."

"Yuanming thanks the Academy Head and Pavilion Master for your kind words."

You Yuanming said gratefully.

Then he turned to Zhang Jing with a warm smile.

"Junior Brother, cultivate well. This senior brother probably has little chance, but you're different—you might even make it into the top hundred of the True Spirit Ranking."

"This junior will remember Senior Brother's advice."

Zhang Jing replied courteously.

"Then Academy Head, Pavilion Master, and Junior Brother, Yuanming will take his leave now."

With that.

You Yuanming transformed into a magnificent streak of light and soared into the distance, vanishing in moments.

"Let's go in." The Academy Head patted Zhang Jing's shoulder.

"Yes!"

Deep within the palace.

Zhang Jing's footsteps gradually halted.

Not far before him.

A crystalline jade wall stood quietly—nine zhang long and three zhang high—with streams of multicolored spiritual light cascading down its surface like a waterfall, exuding an ethereal immortal aura.

The recent instructions from the Academy Head and Pavilion Master echoed faintly in his ears.

Zhang Jing took a deep breath.

Then strode forward resolutely, walking straight into the jade wall.

Instantly.

Ripples spread across the Flowing Light Immortal Wall.

And Zhang Jing's figure disappeared without a trace.

In a flash of vision.

Zhang Jing found himself in a peculiar place.

Beneath his feet was a gray stone path about one zhang wide.

The surroundings were vast and empty, utterly silent.

A short distance ahead, the path forked into two winding trails that extended beyond sight.

"Is this the promotion examination site within the Flowing Light Immortal Wall?"

A flicker of curiosity passed through Zhang Jing's heart as he carefully surveyed his surroundings.

How would the examination proceed?

Just as he pondered this.

Several lines of ancient seal script glowing with faint spiritual light suddenly appeared in the air before him.

His gaze swept over them instantly.

After ten-some breaths.

Understanding dawned in Zhang Jing's eyes.

"So that's how it is?"

For outer court disciples to promote to the inner court, there were only two methods, corresponding to the two paths before him.

The first was the conventional route.

A comprehensive assessment of the cultivator's cultivation level, mental state, consciousness, mastery of techniques, and many other aspects.

This method's requirements for examinees were relatively lower.

As long as one passed three of the many assessed aspects, they could pass the examination and be promoted to inner court disciple.

The second was the unconventional route.

Its requirements for examinees were extremely high, with few passing this way, but its advantage was the relatively simple and fast process.

Reading this.

Zhang Jing couldn't help glancing at the path to his right, a faint smile flashing at the corner of his eye.

"Matching opponents based on cultivation level? Winner passes directly, loser returns the way they came—how direct. I like it!"

Without much hesitation.

He chose the fastest route.

Outside.

The waiting Academy Head seemed to recall something, a playful expression appearing as he asked curiously:

"Junior Brother Yuan, which method do you think that little fellow Zhang Jing will choose for his promotion examination?"

The moment the words fell.

The one addressed as 'Junior Brother Yuan'—the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master—answered without thinking:

"Senior Brother, need you even ask? He'll undoubtedly choose the fastest and most difficult route."

After a pause, he explained further:

"Though Zhang Jing usually keeps an extremely low profile, appearing quiet and gentle, in truth, that little fellow harbors a hint of pride deep inside."

"Perhaps even he hasn't realized it himself."

"Haha, well said. But geniuses—if they didn't have that pride in their hearts, that would be abnormal."

The Academy Head chuckled.

Having lived over a thousand years, they were both shrewd judges of character who had seen countless individuals.

Their eyes were naturally keen.

At first glance, they could detect that pride emanating from Zhang Jing's very bones.

As they spoke.

The Flowing Light Immortal Wall suddenly changed.

The flowing lights gradually faded, revealing a scroll gleaming with gold and jade hues.

The scroll slowly unfurled.

Displaying over two hundred names inscribed upon it.

And at the very end.

Zhang Jing's name slowly appeared upon it.

"Haha, that was quick—as expected of a genius who's comprehended perfect Dao Intent!" The Academy Head praised, then said with a smile: "Congratulations, Junior Brother Yuan. With this little fellow here, your Thousand Techniques Pavilion's status will remain transcendent for the next hundred and eighty years!"

"Senior Brother, mutual congratulations!"

The Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master responded, unable to contain his joy as he strode toward the Flowing Light Immortal Wall.

A ritual seal had somehow appeared in his hand.

Behind him.

The Academy Head now held a purple ritual robe he had prepared personally, along with an exquisite jade key.

Within the key pulsed an obscure fluctuation.

That faintly resonated with an immortal island where spiritual veins converged, deep within Dragon Marsh Lake.
