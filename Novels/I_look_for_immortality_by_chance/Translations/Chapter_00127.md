# Chapter 127: Seven-Phase Exquisite Pagoda and Boundless Sword Seal! (Combined)

The light dissipated as a handsome young man in a blue Daoist robe, his hair tied with a jade hairpin and sleeves billowing, landed gracefully in the hall.

Seeing the newcomer, the old man was momentarily stunned. He had never expected someone to arrive so quickly.

"Junior Brother Gu?"

But when he clearly saw the young man's face, he froze again.

During his Qi Refinement days, Gu Yuan had visited the Fate Hall twice to receive missions. Because he had solved the mystery surrounding Senior Sister Linglong's death and earned the favor of the Supreme Elder, the old man had taken special notice of him.

Since then, Gu Yuan's reputation in the Dao Academy had grown increasingly prominent. His exploits in the Ancient Mountain Secret Realm were widely known—he had seized nine spiritual energies in one go, surpassing the seven great noble families and establishing himself as a new force.

This made the old man wonder if Gu Yuan's relationship with the Supreme Elder was truly just about the bounty.

Now, seeing him arrive so swiftly, the old man's suspicions deepened.

"Senior Brother Yuan!"

Gu Yuan clasped his hands and bowed in greeting.

In the past, he would have addressed the old man as "Uncle-Master," but today, such formalities were unnecessary.

"How did you get here so quickly?" the old man couldn't help but ask.

"I happened to be coming to the Fate Hall to pick up a mission when I saw the Supreme Elder's golden decree. The Supreme Elder has shown me great kindness—without him, I wouldn't be where I am today. Since he has a request, I naturally must fulfill it with all my might. There's no need to issue the mission further, Senior Brother. I accept this task and will see it through to the end!"

Gu Yuan bowed again, his tone resolute.

Missions in the Fate Hall operated on a first-come, first-served basis. Gu Yuan was the first to arrive, and his ambiguous relationship with Sword Fox Supreme Elder made the old man reluctant to refuse. With a flick of his hand, he tossed the golden decree to Gu Yuan.

"In that case, go ahead. The token can directly open the restrictions of the 'Cold Moon Secret Land.' However, the secret land is filled with biting winds and unbearable cold. You've only just broken through to Foundation Establishment, and your divine sense is still weak. Be extremely careful—don't push yourself too hard. If it becomes too much, withdraw immediately. Others will take over if necessary."

Perhaps because of Gu Yuan's unusual connection with the Supreme Elder, the old man offered a word of caution.

"Rest assured, Senior Brother. A little pain is nothing to me."

Gu Yuan took the token with a faint smile, bowed once more, and then transformed into a streak of light, flying swiftly toward the Cold Moon Secret Land.

---

The Cold Moon Secret Land was located in a peculiar place—within the "White Worm Frost Prison," where the Dao Academy confined errant disciples.

But now that Gu Yuan had reached Foundation Establishment, his status had risen significantly. Coupled with the Supreme Elder's token, he encountered no obstacles as he passed through the prison and arrived at a frost-covered pool.

The pool was vast, its surface pure white, with an unending mist of icy air swirling above it—a scene straight out of a snowbound realm.

"Buzz—"

Upon arrival, Gu Yuan channeled a surge of mana into the token. It trembled violently, releasing a strange energy that caused a hazy portal to emerge from the frosty pool.

Beyond the portal, countless snowflakes fluttered in the air. A mere wisp of the icy-blue frost that seeped out instantly turned the entire pool into a frozen cavern.

Gu Yuan even felt a thread of extreme cold invade his sea of consciousness, as if attempting to freeze his divine sense.

"Whoosh—"

An invisible wind swept through the void like a thousand blades. Gu Yuan felt as though his soul had been pierced, sending waves of excruciating pain through him.

Yet his expression remained unchanged as he strode forward into the portal.

"Whoosh—"

All around him was a world of white, as if everything had been frozen solid by the frost. No living creature could be seen.

The biting wind and swirling snow not only froze the flesh but also assaulted the soul. A Qi Refinement cultivator trapped here would have their soul scattered by the wind within moments.

Even as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Gu Yuan felt his soul wracked with pain, his sea of consciousness coated in frost.

But he endured, his flying light swift as he soared toward the distance.

The Cold Moon Secret Land was not vast. At its edges, white flashes of light flickered intermittently—signs of collapsing space.

This secret land had existed for an unknown length of time and was on the verge of disintegration.

At its center lay a clear, expansive lake.

Strangely, despite the extreme cold, the lake remained unfrozen.

At the heart of the lake grew white snow lotuses, pure as ice, without a trace of impurity, their petals translucent and breathtakingly beautiful.

At the center of each lotus were tiny stamens, rippling like flowing water and emitting a faint fragrance.

Seeing this, Gu Yuan accelerated, flying straight toward the snow lotuses.

"Boom—"

But just then, a violent gust of wind erupted from the lake. The intense cold nearly froze his thoughts, causing his flying light to falter as he plummeted toward the water.

The Cold Moon Secret Land was no benevolent place. Though it lacked savage beasts or sinister demons, treasures of the spirit were still guarded by the power of heaven and earth.

Gu Yuan had only just entered Foundation Establishment. While his extraordinary willpower allowed him to endure the pain in his soul and divine sense, when the cold reached a certain intensity, it could bypass endurance and freeze one's will outright.

Though the lake was unfrozen, its water was far colder than the blizzard outside. Falling into it would doom even a Foundation Establishment cultivator in moments.

"Pah—"

Just before he hit the water, Gu Yuan bit his tongue hard, forcing himself back to clarity. He immediately activated the Minor Titan Seal and the Frost Rhino Dragon Elephant Star Spirit, transforming into a several-zhang-tall ice-blue giant.

Though the Minor Titan Seal and the Frost Rhino Dragon Elephant Star Spirit were only at the Qi Refinement level, with the support of his Foundation Establishment mana, they still provided a slight boost to his strength.

His soul and divine sense gained a momentary surge, allowing him to regain control of his flying light and halt his descent.

Yet the icy pain in his soul persisted.

But for Gu Yuan, as long as he could still think, a little pain was inconsequential.

"Swish—"

His flying light did not stop. With a sweep of his mana, he gathered all the snow stamens from the lake in mere moments.

"Whoosh—"

With the stamens gone, the snow lotuses withered instantly, as if their life force had been drained.

In the distance, flickering cracks of light grew wider, and the secret land's collapse accelerated.

"If this continues, in a few decades, the secret land will likely collapse entirely. There may be no more snow stamens to harvest in the future..."

Witnessing this strange sight, Gu Yuan sighed inwardly.

An ordinary person collecting snow stamens for the Supreme Elder wouldn't think much of it—perhaps assuming the Supreme Elder enjoyed their taste or had other uses for them. But Gu Yuan was different. His thoughts inexplicably wandered further.

However, now was not the time for such musings. Shaking his head to clear his mind, he activated the token and left the secret land.

The extreme cold of the secret land lingered even after his departure. Frost clung to his hair and brows, and his face remained pale and stiff.

But he paid it no mind. Bearing these "wounds," he flew at full speed toward Jade Gourd Peak.

In no time at all, the peak came into view.

---

Jade Gourd Peak was perpetually blanketed in snow, its chilling winds evoking the landscapes of the northern realms. Frozen spiritual springs and frost-covered trees adorned the peak in a silver-white splendor.

Yet the entire mountain was protected by a grand formation. Not even a Golden Core cultivator could set foot on it without the peak lord's permission—let alone a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

This was one of the Dao Academy's seven main peaks, guarded by a Golden Core expert. No one was allowed to enter without authorization.

At this moment, a figure stood before the peak, bowing respectfully and calling out, "Disciple Gu Yuan has returned with the Frost Soul Snow Lotus Stamens, offering them to the Supreme Elder!"

"Swish—"

The moment Gu Yuan finished speaking, an irresistible force enveloped him, whisking him away in an instant.

---

Though he had now built his Dao Foundation and his strength had greatly increased, he was still as helpless as a child before this power.

Yet the force came and went swiftly.

In the blink of an eye, Gu Yuan found himself standing in a new location.

He looked up and saw himself before a frosty pool, facing a jade platform.

On the platform sat a blurred figure, hands resting on a zither. The music was melodious and soothing at first, but in an instant, it turned fierce and resounding, like the clashing of metal.

The notes transformed into swords, shaking the void as countless sword energies rose to slice through heaven and earth.

After a long while, the music gradually ceased, and the figure slowly turned.

Yet its face remained indistinct.

"To think it's you again..."

A voice echoed in Gu Yuan's ears as a sharp gaze descended from the platform. He felt as though all his secrets had been laid bare, as if standing naked in the snow, his heart trembling.

"Disciple has completed the Fate Hall mission and retrieved the snow stamens for the Supreme Elder."

Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Gu Yuan presented several jade boxes.

But the figure did not immediately take them, instead asking calmly, "You've reached Foundation Establishment?"

It was a redundant question, yet Gu Yuan dared not be careless. "It is entirely thanks to the Supreme Elder's grace—for guiding me into the sect and bestowing upon me magical tools—that I stand here today. Henceforth, whatever the Supreme Elder commands, this disciple will carry out without hesitation, even at the cost of my life."

"You certainly know how to curry favor."

The figure chuckled lightly, as if shaking its head.

But Gu Yuan sensed an opportunity. During his Qi Refinement days, the Supreme Elder had never smiled in his presence, and their exchanges had been brief. Now, the elder's demeanor was noticeably warmer. Seizing the moment, he pressed on:

"By sheer luck, I obtained nine spiritual energies at the Flowing Clouds Banquet. I now command several Foundation Establishment subordinates, all at the Supreme Elder's disposal."

"Your exploits have reached even Jade Gourd Peak. But all is illusion—once conflict erupts and flames rise, it will vanish in an instant..."

The figure on the platform shook its head slightly, as if sighing.

Seeing Gu Yuan's confusion, the figure flicked a finger, sending a streak of azure light shooting toward him like a meteor.

Gu Yuan seemed to understand. Channeling his mana, he summoned various seals within his body, manifesting different techniques to meet the azure light.

---

It was a cyan phoenix with four wings and a green tail, its eyes blazing like flames, wreathed in terrifying cyan true fire. In an instant, it obliterated all of Gu Yuan's seals and surged toward him with overwhelming force.

But just before it reached him, it dissipated like an illusion.

"Now that you're at Foundation Establishment, have you forged a spiritual artifact?" the figure asked.

"Disciple has obtained a Golden Bamboo Sword, but I have yet to forge a sword seal. I do not yet possess a spiritual artifact," Gu Yuan replied respectfully.

"The Su Clan possesses a spiritual artifact called the True Luan Mirror, which seals the essence of a peak Earth Demon-grade Azure Luan within it. What you just faced was a fraction of its power. If you forge a sword seal, can you withstand this Luan?"

Gu Yuan fell silent.

Then he bowed deeply. "I beg the Supreme Elder to show mercy and save me!"

Earth Demon realm was equivalent to the human Foundation Establishment realm, and a peak Earth Demon was akin to a Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivator. Facing such a spiritual artifact at full power would be like confronting a Foundation Establishment Perfection expert—far beyond his current capabilities.

From the Supreme Elder's words, it seemed the Su Clan intended to act against him.

"A tall tree catches the wind."

"Though the Flowing Clouds Banquet was a rule we established, not all are magnanimous. You must understand—those spiritual energies were originally meant for their own plans..."

"Even if you memorize the sect's laws, hidden arrows are hard to dodge."

"The Scarlet Moon Great River has stood for millennia. What means of survival do you have now?"

The figure's voice was soft.

Gu Yuan remained silent, bowing once more in supplication.

"Your planning isn't wrong. Those six Foundation Establishment subordinates each have their uses. But focusing only on the future while neglecting the present is futile. On the battlefield, they can only aid you—they cannot be your foundation."

As the figure spoke, a jade-colored pagoda materialized in Gu Yuan's palm.

"For all your claims of being a Foundation Establishment force, you lack even a high-grade protective spiritual artifact. How can you command others?"

"This treasure is called the 'Seven-Phase Exquisite Pagoda.' It can attack and defend. Its body is forged from Spirit-Sealing Jade—as long as your mana holds, it can withstand a thousand techniques. Even a supreme-grade spiritual artifact can only breach it momentarily."

"Moreover, this pagoda can capture Earth Demon essences and imprison them within for you to command. However, the essences within are all dead. You must capture new ones to fill it."

The cold voice faded as the jade vials containing the snow stamens vanished from Gu Yuan's hands.

"My deepest gratitude, Supreme Elder!"

---

Gu Yuan was overjoyed and bowed in thanks.

"This is merely your reward for retrieving the snow stamens," the figure said indifferently before asking, "When you entered the Cold Moon Secret Land, did you see signs of collapse? How much longer can it endure?"

Gu Yuan answered promptly, "To be honest, Supreme Elder, it may not last another sixty years..."

A soft sigh came from the platform before another streak of light descended into Gu Yuan's hands.

It was a golden manual, thin as a cicada's wing, with delicate characters inscribed upon it.

"Boundless Sword Seal!"

"This is the sword seal of my cultivation. Its profundity is no less than the academy's Golden Radiance Sword Seal—the only difference lies in the wielder."

"Your fortune is unusual. You may be able to cultivate this seal."

"However, you must also do something for me."

"Whatever the Supreme Elder commands, Gu Yuan will spare no effort!"

"When the campaign against the Scarlet Moon Great River begins, you must seize 'Heartsever Isle.'"
