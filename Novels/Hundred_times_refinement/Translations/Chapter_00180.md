# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 128: The Taibai Sword Immortal  

The churning black clouds gradually dispersed, revealing a gaunt middle-aged man exuding a terrifying aura of killing intent.  

A demonic cultivator!  

Gasps of surprise erupted from the crowd, many wearing expressions of disbelief.  

Demonic cultivators were notorious. While orthodox cultivators weren't necessarily sworn enemies with them, relations were far from cordial. It was rare for the two to appear together.  

What were they doing at the Bìyún Mountain's Nascent Soul Formation celebration?  

Moreover, this demonic cultivator was a Core Formation expert.  

This alone was enough to shock the assembled cultivators. It was well known that demonic cultivation techniques—charitably described as "unconventional"—were often seen as shortcuts.  

At lower cultivation stages, progress was indeed rapid, and forming a Foundation was much easier compared to orthodox cultivation. However, as one advanced, numerous hidden flaws emerged, slowing progress. Core Formation, in particular, was a major bottleneck, with a success rate only one-fifth that of orthodox cultivators.  

In the immortal realm, there was a saying: "Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators are common, but Core Formation ones are rare."  

Though demonic cultivators struggled to reach Core Formation, once they succeeded, their combat prowess surpassed orthodox cultivators of the same level. Their techniques were often overwhelmingly powerful.  

Faced with a Core Formation expert, the two Foundation Establishment disciples from Bìyún Mountain grew uneasy—until a voice reached their ears: "You two, step back."  

"Yes, Elder!"  

Relieved, they quickly retreated into the crowd. A one-armed middle-aged man in moon-white robes stepped forward. Though missing his left hand, no one dared underestimate him. Murmurs spread through the crowd:  

"Heavens, it's the Taibai Sword Immortal!"  

"Second only to the Nascent Soul elders of Bìyún Mountain."  

"I hear he despises evil. That demonic cultivator is in trouble now."  

...  

Lín Xuán's expression flickered. He had heard of the Taibai Sword Immortal during his time at the Spirit Herb Mountain—not because the man was particularly famous, but because his role at Bìyún Mountain was of personal interest to Lín Xuán.  

He was the elder in charge of the herb garden!  

With him here, the garden's defenses would be weakened.  

Though tempted, the memory of the terrifying Seven-Colored Sword Formation—capable of slaying even Core Formation cultivators—damped his enthusiasm. He wasn't about to gamble with his life.  

As for the demonic cultivator's arrival, Lín Xuán was content to watch. The more chaos at the celebration, the better his chances of slipping through unnoticed.  

---  

Most cultivators shared similar thoughts, though not necessarily with Lín Xuán's ulterior motives. Few dared to "pluck hairs from a tiger's mouth."  

They simply didn't want Bìyún Mountain to grow too dominant and hoped for some embarrassment to humble the sect.  

Yet, contrary to expectations, the Taibai Sword Immortal—known for his intolerance of evil—didn't clash with the uninvited demonic cultivator. After a tense exchange, he actually invited the man to take a seat.  

The crowd exchanged baffled glances, but no one dared protest. Even the leaders of the Single Gorge Sect and Thundercloud Manor merely smirked.  

Lín Xuán, however, frowned in thought.  

Though the two had set up a soundproof barrier, Lín Xuán caught fragments of their conversation thanks to the unique properties of his "Nine Heavens Mystic Art," which could penetrate such barriers.  

However, due to the distance and the Core Formation cultivator's power, Lín Xuán—still a novice in the art—only caught disjointed phrases:  

"Extreme Demon Venerable... seclusion... a hundred years... Nascent Soul..."  

At first, the Taibai Sword Immortal had worn a mocking smile. But after the demonic cultivator handed him a jade slip, his expression turned grave, and he ushered the man to the eastern seating area.  

Was this demonic cultivator a disciple of the Extreme Demon Venerable—a Nascent Soul stage demonic cultivator?  

Lín Xuán pieced together a startling possibility but soon dismissed further speculation. Whether Bìyún Mountain was colluding with demonic cultivators mattered little to him. His priority was seizing the chance to steal the Seven-Star Grass from the herb garden.  

The assembled cultivators, all seasoned foxes, quickly regained their composure after the initial stir.  

Then, the Bìyún Mountain sect master stood and cleared his throat. "Fellow Daoists, welcome to our humble sect. Today, we gather to celebrate Elder Zhào's successful Nascent Soul Formation..."  

Lín Xuán ignored the formalities, instead discreetly observing the Taibai Sword Immortal's movements. Since many were watching the prominent elder, his scrutiny went unnoticed.  

A plan began to take shape in his mind.  

Suddenly, an overwhelming spiritual pressure engulfed the area. Lín Xuán's breath caught as if crushed by an invisible force. Even Core Formation experts struggled to remain composed, while Foundation Establishment cultivators turned pale, and Qi Condensation disciples collapsed outright.  

The pressure vanished as quickly as it came.  

"Apologies, fellow Daoists. That was Elder Zhào's way of greeting everyone."  

Lín Xuán sneered inwardly. A greeting? More like a show of force. But the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator was indeed terrifying—mere spiritual pressure could overwhelm thousands.  

Others likely cursed inwardly but maintained polite expressions, glancing at the leaders of the other major sects, hoping they'd protest. Yet, for reasons unknown, the Single Gorge Sect and Thundercloud Manor remained silent, disappointing those hoping for conflict.  

Stranger still, the Nascent Soul elder vanished after this display, leaving the celebration in the hands of the Bìyún Mountain sect master.  

The absence of the main guest made the event feel hollow, though beneath the surface, schemes and power plays continued.  

For lower-ranking disciples and rogue cultivators, however, the gathering was a rare opportunity. Never in a century had so many cultivators assembled in Yōuzhōu. Many took advantage of the free mingling to trade resources or negotiate with sects.  

Those wishing to leave could do so, though few chose to.  

Amid the lively chaos, Lín Xuán noted that the Taibai Sword Immortal was engrossed in conversation with several Core Formation experts, with more joining the circle. Clearly, he wouldn't be free anytime soon.  

Seizing the moment, Lín Xuán slipped away.  

After ensuring he wasn't followed, he landed in a secluded spot, swallowed a Spirit-Concealing Pill, and activated his Heavenly Demon Disguise Art to assume the Taibai Sword Immortal's appearance.  

He then affixed an illusionary talisman to his left arm—a high-grade artifact costing hundreds of spirit stones—to mimic the elder's missing limb. While not perfect, it should suffice against casual inspection.  

His research had confirmed that the herb garden was guarded solely by the Taibai Sword Immortal. Bìyún Mountain's confidence stemmed from multiple layers of restrictions, including the Seven-Colored Sword Formation—impenetrable to all but Nascent Soul cultivators.  

Though risky, this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Without the elder present, breaching the garden's defenses would otherwise be impossible.  

Satisfied with his disguise, Lín Xuán flew toward the herb garden.  

"Elder Taibai!"  

A voice called from behind. Startled, Lín Xuán turned stiffly to see a figure approaching on a wisp of blue mist.
