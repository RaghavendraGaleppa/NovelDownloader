# Chapter 607: Everyone’s Gaze Towards Me Has Changed

Xu Yunfan stopped wasting words. Seeing that the others had begun their preparations, he glanced once more at the unconscious Ye Xuan.

His expression solemn, he stepped with practiced precision, his hand seals changing rapidly, leaving only afterimages.

The potent Divine霄 (Shenxiao) Law Power within his Dantian surged forth, stirring the violent astral winds around him.

With a flick of his sleeve, one hundred and eight small array flags turned into streaks of flowing light, vanishing into the void in an instant and embedding themselves into the nodes of the surrounding earth veins.

Countless invisible yet tangible array patterns spread out from him, crazily covering the ground and the void, quickly connecting the earth’s killing intent with the Nine Heavens’ Mystic Wind.

Zhang Qiaoluo watched calmly, but a hint of barely detectable surprise flashed through her eyes.

Xu Yunfan’s speed in setting up the array far exceeded that of a normal array cultivator. It was almost as if the array patterns formed themselves the moment he willed it, indicating that his understanding of the heavenly and earthly mechanisms and the laws of the Dao of Arrays was nearly at the level of a Grandmaster.

No wonder the True Lord held him in such high regard.

Sun Yue twisted her neck with interest, the sound of her bones cracking like popping beans, seemingly warming up for the imminent battle.

Mo Qisha, like the most patient hunter, silently faded away, vanishing into the deepest shadows of the canyon.

Lu Chuan had already taken his position at the core of the array’s eye, hands clasped behind his back, his aura poised to strike. His gaze was sharp as lightning, piercing through layers of astral wind to lock onto the distant horizon where a chilling sword intent, carrying the meaning of severing all evil, was approaching ever closer.

The world instantly became more oppressive, leaving only the fierce howling of the astral winds and the low hum of Xu Yunfan’s fingertips guiding the array.

When Xu Yunfan finally stamped the last complex rune into the void, the entire "Nine Heavens Five Thunders Yin-Yang Chaos Spirit Covering Killing Array" abruptly contracted. The vast fluctuations of the array vanished like a tide into the surrounding mountain forest and rock walls, leaving no sound.

An indescribable rhythm of cause and effect spread out, as if this area had been temporarily stripped from the heavens and earth, covered by a layer of hazy gauze.

This was a secret technique of cause and effect that Xu Yunfan had carefully set up. It would be extremely difficult to see through the secrets here unless one was proficient in this path or possessed a cultivation realm that completely suppressed everyone else.

Lu Chuan stood not far away, sensing the array power that had vanished in an instant yet remained everywhere. A sliver of shock flashed through the depths of his pupils.

He could feel the massive earth vein killing intent beneath the array foundation being efficiently guided and restrained. It was merging with the hidden, mighty thunder power in the sky, as well as that strange, ceaselessly flowing energy that differentiated Yin and Yang, forming a precise and lethal structure.

He couldn't help but ask, "This array... it can actually reach such a level?"

Xu Yunfan’s Law Power stirred slightly within him, his face turning slightly pale for a moment, looking as if the process had been extremely exhausting.

Seeing this, the others subconsciously assumed that setting up such a grand array had indeed cost him a great deal.

Xu Yunfan’s tone remained calm and steady. "This is the 'Nine Heavies Five Thunders Yin-Yang Chaos Spirit Covering Killing Array.' Arrays are divided into nine grades. This array ranks sixth, which is considered top-tier within the Foundation Establishment realm."

"This array cost me three-tenths of my heart’s essence blood, supplemented by seventeen specific spiritual materials, just to barely step over the threshold of the sixth grade. Its core lies in invoking the might of Divine霄 thunder and harnessing the power of Yin-Yang rotation. Its greatest wonder is that with a slight guidance from me, it uses the dense earth vein killing intent here to completely conceal the internal aura and cause-and-effect entanglements, forming a small, independent realm of cause-and-effect mist."

He paused, then continued, "The array is divided into three main domains. The Divine霄 Domain invokes the righteous thunder of the Nine Heavens to break evil and destroy laws. The Yin-Yang Domain harmonizes the Five Elements' generation and restraint, disrupting spiritual mechanisms. The Chaos Spirit Domain uses killing intent to nourish the Confusing Spirit Heart Thunder, specifically targeting the soul. The three domains overlap and interlock. Within the Foundation Establishment realm, this is a top-tier killing array. Even a Foundation Establishment peak cultivator who enters would, without a special protective treasure or a heaven-defying method to break the array, only be worn down by endless thunderfire, killing intent, and chaotic spirit power. In the end, they would face body and soul destruction, not even a remnant soul able to escape the thunder tribulation."

Zhang Qiaoluo, Sun Yue, and Mo Qisha, who were listening quietly, all felt their hearts tremble slightly upon hearing this.

They naturally knew the reputation of a sixth-grade grand array. Ordinary forces had no way of setting one up. Even a great True Lord at Foundation Establishment peak, unless they specialized in the Dao of Arrays or had a deep foundation, would find it no easy task to set one up.

Not only had Xu Yunfan succeeded, but he had also precisely invoked the earth vein killing intent and applied a secret technique of cause and effect to conceal it. This level of attainment in the Dao of Arrays was truly astonishing.

The original scrutinizing intent in Zhang Qiaoluo’s gaze as she looked at Xu Yunfan quietly faded away, replaced by a deeper recognition and a hint of barely detectable wariness and flattery.

It was very necessary to be on good terms with such a Grandmaster of the Dao of Arrays.

For a moment, her gaze towards Xu Yunfan changed, becoming somewhat watery.

Xu Yunfan: "..."

Sun Yue’s eyes were solemn, while Mo Qisha’s aura grew even heavier, like a stone merging with its surroundings.

Seeing that Xu Yunfan was observing his own nose with his eyes closed in meditation, Zhang Qiaoluo retracted her gaze and looked at the unconscious Ye Xuan on the ground.

Without the slightest hesitation, she flicked a point of dark light from her fingertip, which accurately merged into Ye Xuan’s brow.

Ye Xuan’s body trembled violently, and she let out a soft groan as she awakened.

The confusion in her eyes only lasted for an instant before she recognized the bewitching face before her, which wore a cold sneer.

"Zhang Qiaoluo, you vicious woman, despicable and shameless! The Wansheng Sword Sect will never let you go!"

Ye Xuan’s eyes turned bloodshot as she cursed loudly, struggling to lunge forward. However, the restrictions within her body had not been lifted, and her Law Power was sluggish, leaving her only able to struggle futilely.

Zhang Qiaoluo looked down at her. "Save your strength. Soon, you won't even have the energy to curse."

A short while later, Lu Chuan suddenly spoke.

"They’re here."

Sun Yue was surprised. "So fast!?"

Her gaze turned towards the entrance of the valley, where a terrifying sharpness that made one’s heart palpitate was gathering, growing clearer by the second.

Before her voice had faded, a sharp and unrivaled sword intent, as if capable of cutting through the void, suddenly descended.

It wasn't a flight technique; it was more like it had been "slashed" over from an extremely distant place, crossing space to lock onto the core of the valley.

The intensity of that sword intent was like the rising sun, instantly stripping all the grass and trees of their original colors, leaving only a cold, sharp brilliance.

The air made a weeping sound as it was torn apart. Invisible sword qi plowed through the ground a step ahead of the figure, carving out deep trenches that pointed directly at Zhang Qiaoluo and Lu Chuan’s location.

The true battle erupted with a bang the moment the sword intent descended.

"Attack!" Lu Chuan roared, a sharp light bursting from his eyes.

He knew well the terror of Ye Yuan, the leader of the Ye family, whose sword path cultivation was extraordinary. He dared not hold back in the slightest, and the "True Law of the Mystic Clear Imperial Edict" within him operated at full power.

He saw him form a sword with his fingers like a brush, drawing in the air. An ancient, vigorous "Edict" character, imbued with the charm of the Heavenly Dao, instantly manifested.

These edicts were not mere talismans, but true words that condensed his cultivation and communicated with the authority of the heavens and earth.

"By Edict, let the clear and the turbid separate, and the spiritual qi return to its flow!" Lu Chuan declared, his voice carrying an indescribable majesty.

*Boom!*

The spiritual qi of heaven and earth within a radius of several hundred zhang instantly went into turmoil.

The originally peaceful and freely flowing spiritual qi particles, under the command of the true word edict, seemed to have found their sole sovereign.
