# Chapter 87: Tenth Level of Qi Refinement (Seeking First Subscription!)

Time flowed quietly by.

As the opening of the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven approached, the figures of inner court disciples became increasingly rare. Among the top ten ranked teams, those under forty years old at the tenth level of Qi Refinement, as well as those at the ninth level on the verge of breakthrough, had all quietly disappeared.

Of course, only a few observant individuals noticed this change. For the vast majority of outer court disciples, everything remained the same. They continued their daily and yearly routines—completing tasks, earning merit points, purchasing cultivation resources, and repeating the cycle.

Inside his cave abode, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes.

With a series of crackling sounds, like the awakening of a terrifying flood dragon, a vast and fierce aura surged outward. The spiritual energy fluctuations unmistakably belonged to the tenth level of Qi Refinement.

"By my calculations, the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven should be opening soon," Zhang Jing murmured, his eyes reflecting both longing and a faint excitement.

Just as Senior Brother Qiu had previously mentioned, the Yuan Water Essences contained vast amounts of pure water-attribute spiritual energy, more than enough to sustain his cultivation needs throughout the Qi Refinement stage, with some to spare.

Thanks to this, over the past year and a half, Zhang Jing had devoted almost all his time to cultivation, rarely bothering with talisman crafting. The results were highly gratifying—four months ago, he had quietly broken through to the tenth level of Qi Refinement.

As for his current strength, while still at the tenth level, his progress had far surpassed that of Senior Brother Li, who had also been at the same level, and was now approaching that of Senior Brother Li. His spiritual sense showed signs of transformation, and the spiritual energy within his body had become thick as mercury, exuding an overwhelmingly powerful aura.

With a thought, Zhang Jing summoned the jade talisman before his eyes.

Lines of skill information flickered rapidly:

**Dharma Seeds:**
- Low-Grade Dharma Seed: Mind's Eye (Cannot be upgraded)

**Cultivation Techniques:**
- *Ocean-Overturning Flood Dragon Void-Seizing True Method* – Level 5 (7112/9600)  
  Skill Traits: Body Like a Flood Dragon (High Grade), Lunar Void Concealment (High Grade)  
- *Five Organs Water Origin Liberation Scripture* – Level 8 (1921/9600)  
  Skill Traits: Five Methods Spirit River (Mid Grade), Five Treasures Spirit River (Mid Grade), Mutual Nourishment (Mid Grade)  
- *Pure Origin Breath Absorption Visualization Method* – Level 7 (740/9600)  
  Skill Traits: Gathering Origin Spirit Light (Low Grade), Crimson Spirit Light (Mid Grade), Dao-Guiding Spirit Light (High Grade)  

**Special:**
- *Ninefold Starry Spirit Talisman Method* – Level 6 (357/2000)  
  Skill Traits: Talisman Source Generation (Mid Grade), Dao-Stacking Spirit Gathering (Mid Grade)  
- *Dark Flood Dragon Devouring Void Dao Rhyme* – 60% Mastery  

Compared to before, the skills displayed on the jade talisman had undergone significant changes. After *Five Organs Water Origin Liberation Scripture* reached Level 7, as expected, a third skill trait—Mutual Nourishment—had appeared.

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing focused his gaze.

*Ding! Ding!*

A massive spiritual river, resembling a colossal serpent, materialized before him. Within its currents, dozens of high-grade magical instruments floated and collided incessantly, their auras intertwined as one, exuding an immensely fearsome presence.

What was even more peculiar was that, aside from these instruments, countless spell-formed fish swam aimlessly through the river. Occasionally, a spell would collide with a magical instrument, dissipating with a crisp metallic ring.

The moment a spell vanished, strange Dao patterns would emerge from the depths of the river—these were the Dharma Seeds formed when spells reached Level 10. Zhang Jing had experimentally embedded them directly into the spiritual river.

As the Dharma Seeds trembled slightly, new spell-formed fish would appear in the river, swiftly joining the existing schools. The endless collisions between spells and instruments seemed to be subtly enhancing the quality of the latter, albeit at an excruciatingly slow pace.

Beyond this, Zhang Jing was most concerned with the *Pure Origin Breath Absorption Visualization Method*. He had discovered that the higher its level, the more absurd the experience required became, far surpassing the norms of other skills.

However, the third skill trait of the method—*Dao-Guiding Spirit Light*—justified the immense investment. Once a month, it allowed Zhang Jing to enter a state akin to enlightenment. Though not as profound as true epiphanies he had experienced before, the monthly occurrence had still enabled him to comprehend 60% of the *Dark Flood Dragon Devouring Void Dao Rhyme*. With another six months, he was confident he could fully master it.

On the eve of the opening, deep within the territory of Yanfang Kingdom, bordering Nanli, lay a region dreaded by mortals—the Hundred Thousand Mountains. It teemed with wolves, tigers, venomous snakes, and poisonous insects, shrouded year-round in lethal miasma.

Yet in its deepest reaches stood a sprawling complex of majestic structures, radiating brilliant spiritual light—the renowned immortal sanctuary, the Divine Thunder Dao Academy.

Atop a towering peak piercing the clouds, a bronze palace loomed amidst swirling mist, its glow repelling wind and snow. Inside, a breathtakingly beautiful woman in her mid-twenties gazed ahead with curiosity, spiritual light shimmering in her eyes.

Before her stood a middle-aged man of short stature yet towering presence.

"Junior Sister, you've trained here for over five years and grasped nearly 70% of your Dao Rhyme. The opening of the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven is your opportunity. Strive to comprehend a trace of Dao Intent within and return to establish a Cyan Dao Foundation—show Dragon Lake and Radiant Light Academies the might of our Divine Thunder's top outer court disciple!" the man encouraged with a smile.

"Senior Brother," the woman replied, her cheeks flushing crimson, "I've met Radiant Light's top disciple, Shen Xiao. But Dragon Lake reportedly has two top talents. Your grand claims might embarrass you if I fail."

"Junior Sister, though both are top disciples, Dragon Lake's two only began cultivating at the end of last year. No matter how fast their cultivation progresses, their Dao Rhyme comprehension can't possibly match yours in such short time," the man chuckled.

Then his expression turned serious. "However, you should pay attention to a Dragon Lake disciple named Zhang Jing."

"Zhang Jing?" the woman repeated thoughtfully.

A similar scene unfolded in Radiant Light Academy, though their intelligence seemed lacking—their focus remained solely on Dragon Lake's Chen Xiandao and Shen Qingqing.

Meanwhile, in Dragon Lake Academy, Chen Xiandao and Shen Qingqing also received guidance. Zhang Jing, however, appeared forgotten by all—until Senior Brother You remarked with a laugh that they should trust their future Chief. Though, he added, it wouldn't hurt if this Chief encountered setbacks in the Void Heaven and chose to focus on talismans instead.

At Senior Brother Li's cave abode:

"Senior Brother, I must trouble you to look after my mount, Deer Thirty-Eight, while I'm away," Zhang Jing requested.

"Don't worry, Junior Brother. Leave your deer to me," Senior Brother Li assured, patting Zhang Jing's shoulder.

He had seen the white deer once before—it never strayed far, wholly devoted to cultivating spirit herbs. Easy to care for.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"

Watching Zhang Jing's retreating figure, Senior Brother Li couldn't help but marvel.

"No wonder Senior Brother You designated him as the next Thousand Methods Pavilion Chief. His talent is terrifying."

After just over half a year, Zhang Jing's aura had nearly caught up to his own. But how many years had he cultivated compared to Zhang Jing? More startlingly, when Zhang Jing approached, Senior Brother Li had sensed a faint but unmistakable threat—like a needle pricking between his brows. His instincts told him Zhang Jing now possessed the power to kill him.

That was truly frightening.
