# Chapter 109: Promoted to Commander, Summoned by the Madam

In his desperation, Li Xian met the attack with both palms, executing the "Tidal Waves Overturning" technique from the Azure Ripple Palm. All the Internal Qi within him gathered into his palms.

The moment he struck, the Qi resembled a rolling great wave crashing toward the shore. It even stirred up the surrounding toxic mist, creating a form that truly looked like a surging tide.

The two clashed palms... Zheng Xuezhang wasn't sure if he was using a fist or a palm; his hands were already crippled, so there wasn't much difference between the two. Now that their hands met, both showed expressions of shock.

Zheng Xuezhang thought to himself: "This kid's martial arts have reached a superior level. The power and attainments in his palm techniques even surpass my Calming Waves Palm by a great deal! I have practiced the Calming Waves Palm for decades and have only just achieved great success. How could someone of his age possess such attainments?!"

"Even the famous geniuses with masters to guide them, those listed on the rankings, wouldn't have such attainments, right?!"

Li Xian, on the other hand, felt the immense power of Zheng Xuezhang's palm force. The moment their palms met, it invaded his arms from his palms, causing his bones to crack instantly.

One strand of Li Xian's Internal Qi was equivalent to ten strands of Zheng Xuezhang's.

He understood the reason in an instant.

Although Internal Qi comes from martial arts, it is born from the physique.

A Food Essence martial artist who has初步 undergone a transformation is physically different from others and absorbs the essence of heaven and earth. The "Internal Qi" generated by this is naturally more potent.

Li Xian endured the severe pain, swept his leg to force Zheng Xuezhang back, and immediately drew his guard's narrow blade to engage in close combat. Zheng Xuezhang was skilled with a large blade, but during the chase, he had long discarded his heavy weapon.

Now empty-handed, he refused to show weakness and fought back. Although he had undergone a transformation, his strength was less than a tenth of what it used to be, so he dared not be careless. Li Xian's blade technique opened and closed, swift as the wind. Relying on his exquisite skills, he actually gained the upper hand.

This advantage was partly due to clever tactics, but it was enough to show that when facing the enemy, he could use one part of his strength to achieve the effect of two.

As they tangled and fought.

The commotion alerted the White Snake.

Li Xian's eyes were sharp; he sensed it early and tried to withdraw from the battle several times. But Zheng Xuezhang, filled with hatred, had finally caught him and was unwilling to let go.

"This Zheng Xuezhang has been provoked by me and hasn't noticed the White Snake. If I continue to tangle with him, I might get swallowed whole by the snake." Li Xian felt a chill run through his body; the White Snake in the mist was even more dangerous.

The White Snake was enormous, about a dozen zhang long. Standing in the瘴 mist, its body was too long to see the end of.

In his urgency, Li Xian had a flash of inspiration. He deliberately exposed a flaw in his martial arts, leaving his center wide open.

Zheng Xuezhang saw that Li Xian's blade technique was严密, powerful yet delicate and agile. The sudden appearance of a flaw was highly suspicious. He also knew that Li Xian was cunning and treacherous, with impeccable schemes and martial arts.

So he didn't dare to strike.

Li Xian cursed, "You old turtle bastard!" and feigned a retreat.

Provoked by these words, Zheng Xuezhang thought, "Even if it's a trap, I'll step into it!" He channeled all his Internal Qi and landed a heavy punch on Li Xian's chest.

The moment it landed, he was suddenly stunned: "It was a real flaw?" He was overjoyed. With this punch landing solidly, how could that kid survive?

Li Xian was sent flying, spat a mouthful of blood, and was almost knocked unconscious. He gritted his teeth and held on, barely managing to stay conscious.

Using the force of the punch, he widened the distance.

"That was close... If not for the fish-scale chest armor, this punch would have killed me!" Li Xian touched his chest armor.

"He's not dead!"

Zheng Xuezhang saw Li Xian land and run away again. He couldn't understand why he wasn't dead and was about to chase him again. But after taking two steps, he felt a chill all over. A cold breath blew upon him.

It felt like winter had returned suddenly.

He looked back and saw a massive snake head hanging above him, its eyes cold and gloomy.

The White Snake flicked its tongue, licking his body. In this deep mountain forest, such a delicious meal was rarely encountered.

"Ah!"

A shrill scream.

Zheng Xuezhang died in the snake's mouth, swallowed whole, leaving no trace of his body. Li Xian's scalp went numb; he didn't dare to stay and hurried out of the toxic mist as fast as possible.

"The White Snake isn't chasing me; it has no interest in me." Li Xian looked back and saw no sign of the White Snake.

"That's right. I heard Commander Pang say that transformed martial artists and demonic beasts are natural enemies, preying on each other. That Zheng Xuezhang was a 'Food Essence' martial artist. In the eyes of the White Snake, he was like pure essence of heaven and earth."

"And I... escaped disaster because of this!"

Understanding the reason, Li Xian let out a long sigh of relief, but he still didn't dare to stay long. Enduring the severe pain on his body, he walked for more than seven or eight miles on foot.

"Usually, I hunt beasts for sport. Today, the tables have turned."

"If I were to encounter a bear or a tiger now, I would be buried in a beast's stomach."

Li Xian gave a wry smile. He looked for traces of beasts and avoided them from afar. His hands were fractured; he had strained himself to fight earlier, which had worsened his injuries. If his Internal Qi were abundant, he could have forcefully moved his arms.

But in the previous fight, Li Xian's three-zhang-six-lake of Qi had long dried up. He needed rest and food to replenish it. Now Li Xian was extremely weak, and his situation was worrying.

"There are fewer beast tracks here; I'll rest for a moment." Li Xian let his hands hang down, found a secluded spot, and sat down to rest.

He took a full punch to the chest. Although protected by the "fish-scale chest armor," the impact was heavy.

"If not for the White Snake, I wouldn't have suffered such a severe injury. But also because of the White Snake, Zheng Xuezhang died completely."

Leaning against the tree trunk, Li Xian muttered to himself. His face was pale. He sat in a daze for half an hour, recovering some strength, and a little Internal Qi condensed in his Qi Lake.

He channeled Qi to his hands, enduring the pain to take out some dried meat from his chest. He slowly chewed the dried meat, bit by bit replenishing his physical strength.

With food to nourish him, his Internal Qi recovered faster.

"Fortunately, I have a few Recovery Pills." Li Xian took out a porcelain bottle. The lid was tightly sealed. Usually, with nimble hands and feet, it was easy to open. But now, with his hands fractured and tendons injured, he couldn't even move his fingers without the aid of Qi.

Currently, he had to use a crude method.

He smashed the porcelain bottle against a stone, then trembled as he put the pill into his mouth.

The Recovery Pills were boiled and refined from ingredients like mountain ginseng, tiger meat, and bear tendons. The nourishing effect was obvious. Once eaten, warm currents nourished his body.

His Internal Qi gradually recovered.

"Food Essence martial artists are truly formidable. I only exchanged one palm with him, and my hands are injured so severely."

"Now... the Black Water Gang members haven't dispersed yet. If I return to the village, it will be hard to deal with them. I'll rest here for two days first."

With Zheng Xuezhang dead, Li Xian's great enemy had finally drifted away like the wind.

Li Xian practiced diligently. During these past few months, he hadn't slacked for a single day, studying almost all the martial arts he had obtained.

[Four Directions Fist] goes without saying; it has long reached its peak. [Gentle Breeze Leg], after months of bitter practice, has also caught up and reached its peak. Without the speed boost from the Gentle Breeze Leg and the secret of the "light" character, how could Li Xian have tangled with Zheng Xuezhang for so long.

[Azure Ripple Palm] was already perfect long ago; he never neglected it after reaching perfection. After all, among Li Xian's martial arts, only [Azure Ripple Palm] has entered the superior level.

[Proficiency: 19980/24000, Perfect]

Among the many martial arts, the Azure Ripple Palm has the strongest power. It has become Li Xian's great killing move!

Next is [Great Luo Blade Art]. Among the many martial arts, Li Xian has been the most negligent with [Great Luo Blade], and it has remained at "Great Success" to this day.

Once a martial art reaches Great Success, it can be integrated and understood. When executed, it can be flexibly adapted, incorporating the essence of other martial arts.

When Li Xian wields the blade, the Great Luo Blade isn't particularly powerful on its own. But if he incorporates his understanding of [Four Directions Fist], the blade path becomes unpredictable. If he incorporates his understanding of [Gentle Breeze Leg], the blade path becomes light and agile. If he incorporates [Azure Ripple Palm], it becomes a series of连环 blade techniques, each strike more ferocious than the last.

Therefore, although Li Xian has few martial arts, if it comes to actual combat changes, even Zheng Xuezhang was not his match.

[Great Luo Blade] has stagnated because he intended it to be so. Showing a part and hiding a part is the best strategy.

The "Tiger Gate Claw" he looted from the Fifth Master has also been started. Currently, it is barely proficient.

Five martial arts...

Have created Li Xian's current strength!

"Among Food Essence martial artists, there are also distinctions of strength and weakness."

"This Zheng Xuezhang was the leader of a gang, but... he wasn't as powerful as that 'Immortal in the Jar'. That Immortal in the Jar had first-class lightness skill and incredible speed."

"Skinning a living person was as easy as flipping a hand. This shows his strength was immense."

Li Xian pondered silently.

He thought about the choices he should make. Now that most of his martial arts have [Reached the Peak], if he wants to go further, he needs to obtain [Food Essence], or more powerful, higher-level [Martial Arts].

Martial artists eat, nourish, practice, and soak...

Practice is the cheapest. As for "Nourish," Li Xian still doesn't know what it is.

Not to mention him, even Commander Pang doesn't know what it is.

The intricacies of the martial path, Li Xian has far from figured out. Strictly speaking, he seems to have not even entered the gate.

"I was sent out of the manor; the Madam must have forgotten about me."

"Even if I stayed in the manor, guarding the village for her, I would find it hard to make progress in ten years. It seems... it's time to leave the manor and venture out into the world."

The path has been laid out; the next step is to walk it. Now that he is alone, he fears not the dangers of the Jianghu.

But...

To plunge into the Jianghu in such confusion. Or to put it bluntly, does he even have the qualifications to enter the Jianghu?

If the Jianghu is viewed as the Black Water Gang or the Mountain Wind Stronghold, he is already a "stormy figure," very impressive. But if looking further, without a way in, without anyone to guide him, he might struggle his whole life and still fail to grasp a single opportunity.

Li Xian was broad-minded and stopped thinking about it.

He rested in the wilderness for two days. Li Xian's hand bones gradually healed and he could move them, but he couldn't draw a bow or shoot an arrow yet.

Li Xian equipped his narrow blade and walked back to the village.

He saw that Black River Village had returned to peace, but the whole village was filled with mournful sounds, suonas and gongs...

"Old Master, how tragically you died!"

"Old Master, rest in peace. Wuu wuu wuu."

The villagers wailed in succession.

It turned out that everyone, seeing Li Xian hadn't returned for several days, thought he was dead too. Grief arose, and they held a funeral for him.

Li Xian's mouth twitched. But then he thought, these villagers are simple and honest. After all, they didn't do wrong. If he had really died, it would be nice to have someone thinking of him.

"Ah! Old Master, you're not dead!?" Village Head Fu Bo saw Li Xian and shouted in surprise.

Everyone immediately surrounded him.

Li Xian said, "Alright, just put these things away!"

Li Xian had obtained the method for the "Hundred-Day Bath" medicinal bath. Since winter passed, in mid-March, he had started boiling and soaking in it.

His strength and flexibility... were steadily improving.

But this medicinal bath method was ultimately mixed and crude. Its effect was minimal, but better than nothing.

The lineage of Zheng Xuezhang from the Black Water Gang was almost entirely wiped out by Li Xian. During this period, there was intense fighting.

It was heard that another "Food Essence" big shot took the opportunity to start a new venture and quickly formed the Green Water Gang.

Mid-May.

Li Xian's desire to leave grew stronger. He told Fu Bo that after the Hundred-Day Bath ended, he would flee the manor. If they were to meet again in the future, it would depend on fate.

He asked Fu Bo to keep this matter strictly confidential.

If it leaked, it would be much more troublesome to leave.

Days passed by.

One morning.

The sound of hoofbeats suddenly broke the silence.

An A-rank guard, Ding Hu, dismounted and walked into the village. He knocked on Fu Bo's door and asked, "Where does Li Xian live?"

Fu Bo was stunned. "This... this big brother, what do you want with Master Li?"

"Don't ask too much, just tell me where he is." Ding Hu said impatiently.

"This... this..." Fu Bo hesitated. He knew Li Xian was about to leave, fearing this guard was here to arrest him, so he refused to tell.

"You old fool!" Ding Hu got angry and was about to teach him a lesson.

"Big Brother Ding, what business do you have with me?" Li Xian walked over slowly and said calmly.

Hearing Li Xian call him "Big Brother," Ding Hu shuddered all over. He hurried over, knelt on one knee, and said:

"Commander Li, the Madam has promoted you to Commander. She asks you to return. The manor will send other guards to take over here!"
