Chapter 75: Sighing at the Past

Daylight faded, and a misty night enveloped Scarlet Cloud City. Qin Ming sat silently in his room, watching fragmented images of the past draw near, continuously reassembling and solidifying.

"So you are Li Qingxu," Qin Ming murmured, seeing the feather-robed youth in the vision and learning his name. The two had known each other before, though not as old friends, merely nodding acquaintances.

"A direct descendant of the Li family, possessing exceptionally unique innate talent. While others struggle to be accepted by hermits from the Outer Realm, he was remarkably suited for that path and was favored by an ancient senior, renowned throughout the entire Night World, who accepted him as a closed-door disciple."

Qin Ming frowned. That old senior from the Outer Realm seemed formidable; even millennium-old aristocratic families treated him with respect.

Li Qingxu's figure reappeared before his eyes, his feather robes ethereal as if he were an immortal, his presence refined and otherworldly. Even the glowing purple bamboo staff in his hand was extraordinary, a rare bamboo from a blessed land that had once received heavenly light.

Soon, that figure faded, and more scenes emerged. All the fragmented images reassembled, rushing towards him in a torrent. Aside from some minor details that remained hazy, the main bulk of his past memories returned, causing Qin Ming to continuously rub his temples to relieve his fatigue.

Vast amounts of images and scenes, from childhood to adolescence, those past experiences crashed over him like wave after wave. Qin Ming quickly absorbed and digested them, his heart profoundly complex. The emotions of his former self affected him, threatening to engulf him like a sea of mist.

He circulated the cultivation method from the silk scroll, calming himself, breaking free from the cage of the entire scene, and escaping to look down upon his past. He wanted to view his former self from a different perspective, harboring doubts about certain matters, desiring to examine his past experiences with a critical eye.

"I am Cui Chonghe, a direct descendant of a millennium-old aristocratic family." Qin Ming first confirmed his identity through the memories of his past. The past, in its entirety, seemed to transform into a slightly yellowed book, found by him in a dusty old room. Now, he reopened it.

Qin Ming turned the first page, as if crossing mottled years, returning to over a decade ago.

"Poor child, you've suffered out there. Remember, I am your Seventh Uncle." A young man with thick eyebrows and very bright eyes said, stroking his head, revealing a kind smile with teeth so white they seemed to glow. Qin Ming was extremely familiar with him; this was Cui Hao, one of the people closest to him, with whom he had been intimately close since childhood. He stared ahead; this was his earliest childhood memory.

"Was I ever lost?" Qin Ming whispered. In that scene, he was at most three or four years old, his small clothes tattered. He wished he could recall more, but he couldn't. A normal person's earliest memory usually only begins around the age of three or four.

He was led to bathe, changed into clean clothes, and adorned with fine jade, transformed as if into a different person. Though slightly uneasy, his stubborn self seemed unwilling to show stage fright, his small figure standing perfectly straight, silently upright.

The scene quickly flipped. He moved into the Cui family, where people taught him to read and instructed him on various rules, which he diligently memorized. During this time, he secretly cried, but he didn't want anyone to see him.

"Chonghe, remember your name, don't forget it again. Come, I'll teach you how to write these characters." An elder personally taught him calligraphy.

"Chonghe, come here. This is your biological younger brother, Cui Chongxuan. In the future, you must protect him well. He is one of your dearest kin." Cui Mother appeared. She looked very young, elegant and noble, with delicate and beautiful features. A feather, flowing with golden light, was inserted into her hair as a hairpin, emitting a soft glow, clearly no ordinary item. The child she held in her right hand was very small, only about two years old, but seemed exceptionally intelligent, his eyes round and curious as he sized Qin Ming up.

"He's a year and a half younger than you. From now on, you must love each other. You are the elder brother, you must take care of him more," Cui Mother said.

"Okay!" The nearly four-year-old Qin Ming nodded. He settled into the Cui family, completely accustomed to life there.

Cui Father was very stern and held great prestige in the mansion. The young Qin Ming always remained quiet when he saw him. Perhaps because of this, he was very close to Cui Hao, as his Seventh Uncle had no elder's airs and sometimes took him to bustling streets, even riding exotic beasts with him for wild rides outside the city, and once took him to a painted boat on the Mo Yun River at night. For this, Seventh Uncle Cui Hao was even reprimanded by Cui Father.

The dusty book of years turned another page. Qin Ming looked at his past and saw his eldest brother, Cui Chongxiao, who was a full eight years older than him. Although his elder brother was still a youth, he was already very mature and steady, quite resembling Cui Father. Only when he saw the young Qin Ming did Cui Chongxiao's eyes sparkle with a radiant light, revealing a hint of the youth he ought to be, smiling as he walked over and carefully observed him.

It was said that Cui Chongxiao had apprenticed under a formidable master, but where exactly, Cui Father forbade discussion, let alone rumors spreading. They only knew that this elder brother returned only once every few years. This also showed Cui Father and Cui Mother's cautious nature; they didn't want more people to know about their eldest son, Cui Chongxiao, apprenticing under such a powerful master. Qin Ming had also inadvertently overheard them whispering, learning that his elder brother must have apprenticed in an ancient Taoist tradition related to deities. It wasn't about revering or contemplating deities; instead, this sect had grand ambitions, aiming to subdue those special "phenomena" and "realms" for their own use, to become deities themselves.

Every year, when spring arrived, his parents would receive a special letter that required decoding with several ancient books, very cautiously, as if multi-encrypted. Every time this happened, even the sternest Cui Father would smile, appearing remarkably gentle and radiant. Qin Ming and his younger brother Cui Chongxuan suspected it was a letter from their elder brother that made them so happy. Cui Chongxuan even tried to steal the letter once to read its contents, but he couldn't understand the coded messages at all. He was severely beaten by Cui Father and never dared to cause trouble again.

The Cui family's main lineage had many white-haired old men, all unfathomably powerful. Some had set foot in the Outer Realm and were not often in the clan. One old man, who followed the path of New Life, once playfully inhaled deeply, sucking a four-colored bird from a tree to amuse the younger generation. These elders were either benevolent or strict towards the juniors, all valuing the cultivation of the next generation. Whenever these elders smiled and greeted him, asking Qin Ming to call them Fifth Elder or Seventh Elder, he would recall a blurry figure, a grandfather from his vague childhood memories, whom Qin Ming loudly demanded to find.

"He traveled far away, he has gone to the imperial capital of the Great Yu Kingdom. He almost went crazy practicing the method on the silk scroll before; now he has 'severed all shackles' and is going to find his own path."

"I miss him, I miss that grandfather." Although he had adapted to life in the Cui mansion, Qin Ming couldn't help but feel his eyes redden. Then he wanted that silk scroll back.

"No, the silk scroll is an ancient artifact and cannot be casually handled; it's easily damaged. You must master the first few pages before you can look at it, but... this book is very difficult to cultivate."

From then on, Qin Ming devoted himself to practicing the method on the silk scroll, resolved to master it, persisting every day, rain or shine. He had many cousins, and during this time, a few were chosen by people from the Outer Realm and embarked on very different paths. Some siblings also entered secret cults, others joined more famous sects, and still others remained at home, pursuing the path of Body New Life.

"The silk scroll has a great origin, was it once one of the most famous classics?" Cui Chongxuan, growing older, wanted to follow his elder brother and practice it after learning what he was cultivating. Cui Father rebuked him: "The silk scroll is very difficult to cultivate; one person following this path is enough. You can choose other secret texts." For this, the gradually taller Cui Chongxuan became jealous, complaining why he couldn't practice it, and for a time harbored animosity towards his elder brother.

"I want to know, is the silk scroll the most powerful New Life method?" Cui Chongxuan, in a rare act of defiance against Cui Father, demanded an answer. Cui Father's expression softened considerably, saying, "Who dares claim to be the best? There isn't just one silk scroll in the world; there are equally powerful inheritances, such as the 'Six Imperial Heart Sutra', the 'Tathagata Dharma', and the 'Heaven-Severing Stratagem'. You should diligently cultivate the family's secret texts to lay the most solid foundation. In the future, I might be able to obtain a volume of the 'Six Imperial Heart Sutra' for you. If you are strong enough, it's not impossible for you to truly apprentice under that old master."

Qin Ming spoke up: "Father, in the future, I also want to see the Six Imperial Heart Sutra to verify it with the silk scroll. The New Life method in the latter book is too difficult; it seems impassable."

"What, you've lost confidence in yourself?" Cui Father looked at him, his eyes seemingly able to see straight into one's heart.

"Yes!" Qin Ming felt somewhat agitated, turning and leaving. Afterward, he asked his cousins for some secret texts, wanting to see what other New Life methods were like. The Fifth Elder of the main lineage looked at him with a smile, saying, "The choice of which New Life method to use as a foundation has no small impact; the ultimate achievements differ greatly. If you practice those ordinary secret texts and then, after entering the New Life realm, revert to practicing the method on the silk scroll, the effect will definitely not be as good as consistently adhering to that initial path." After hearing these words, Qin Ming also asked Cui Father and Cui Mother, receiving similar answers. After reading his cousin's visualization techniques and Qi cultivation methods, he discarded them all, not wavering in his determination to master the New Life method of the silk scroll.

The inn room was quiet. Qin Ming was like an outsider, watching his past. He turned another page.

The entire Cui family highly approved of him. Not only within the family, but even when facing outsiders, they generously praised him. Everyone could see that he was a core member of the direct lineage. Early on, various factions already knew that Cui Chonghe was very likely to be the future standard-bearer of the main lineage, and he was being重点trained.

The clan's Second Elder once accidentally revealed while drunk that Cui Chonghe possessed special talent and was extremely suitable for entering the Outer Realm. Whether he cultivated the silk scroll or not was not important; he was destined to become someone close to an immortal. Cui Second Elder disclosed that Cui Chonghe had not been sent away yet because they were waiting for an old senior, renowned throughout the entire Night Mist World, to emerge from seclusion. There was already an agreement for him to apprentice under this senior. Afterward, when Cui Father learned of his drunken ramblings, his face was extremely grim. The Second Elder, knowing he was in the wrong, felt deeply ashamed and punished himself by entering seclusion.

Although Cui Second Elder had revealed secrets while drunk within the clan, some outside still came to know. Consequently, Qin Ming's safety was briefly threatened, with multiple attempts made to harm him, all thwarted by the Cui family. Qin Ming's treatment in the Cui family was indeed excellent. When he was slightly older, his mount was a top-tier one, quite extraordinary, directly a four-times mutated creature. Although four mutations were the limit for that exotic beast, it was quite luxurious to provide it to someone who had not yet reached New Life, considered a top-tier allocation. The Cui family protected him very well. Although there had been repeated attempts at surveillance, no accidents ever occurred.

Furthermore, when Qin Ming was still young, Cui Father had already made an agreement with the Wang family of Thousand Star City: a direct daughter of the Wang family would marry Cui Chonghe, forming a marriage alliance between the two families. Qin Ming had even met the young girl; she was extremely beautiful and loved to smile. However, as he grew older, when the two families gathered again, Cui Father and Cui Mother began to caution him, telling him to be polite and avoid close contact. Once, when he was touring Clear River City with the Wang family's direct daughter, Cui Father even became angry and later reprimanded him.

As Qin Ming grew, although the Cui family still valued him and praised their "Kylin son" to distinguished guests, they rarely let him meet those people again, fearing he would be distracted, urging him to focus solely on the method from the silk scroll. After he turned teenagers, he met many people, from important figures of various great families to direct descendants of millennium-old aristocratic families, and even disciples of Outer Realm hermits. It must be said that millennium-old families possessed profound foundations; even those ancient Taoist traditions, powerful sects, and even Outer Realm hermits were willing to form connections with them.

In those years, rumors constantly circulated that some prominent figures from the Outer Realm would be accepting disciples. Several would emerge from seclusion and enter the mortal world to select suitable disciples, with the location set in Clear River City. The rumors were not false. Various families took action. Li Qingxu, Li Qingyue, the Wang family's direct daughter, and a group of others successively arrived at this grand city, hoping to become disciples of those powerful individuals. It was at this time that Qin Ming felt Li Qingxu's hostility.

Ultimately, some renowned recluses from the Outer Realm indeed appeared, and a small number of people were chosen. A senior of immense background greatly valued Li Qingxu, gifting him a purple bamboo staff nourished by heavenly light upon their first meeting. Afterward, Qin Ming was very confused. Wasn't it said that an old senior renowned throughout the Night Mist World was supposed to take him away? Why was Li Qingxu chosen instead?

"Don't rush, the senior who favors you has not yet emerged from seclusion," Cui Father said.

Thereafter, Qin Ming suffered multiple assassination attempts, but he safely overcame them all. No one expected that the gradually rising Li family would suddenly declare war on the Cui family. Perhaps it was just that Qin Ming didn't notice it then, or perhaps the elders within the Cui family had already known and were prepared.

"A senior from the Li family has actually broken through, potentially becoming near-immortal in the future, while our Cui family's old ancestor has not appeared for two hundred years. The Li family wants to clash with the Cui family to achieve a series of objectives, demonstrate their strength, and ascend to the ranks of true millennium-old aristocratic families. They need such a battle."

"The most frightening thing is that they are supported by someone from behind; they might also be being pushed forward."

...

As the two great families were about to clash, members of the Cui family discussed this, and Qin Ming felt deeply worried for his family after hearing it.

"Our old ancestor still hasn't appeared. The current situation is extremely dire; we might not be able to hold them off. We must preserve our foundation and retreat first. And we must search for the old ancestor again at his seclusion site; I believe he is still in the world, and we must make him return immediately."

One late night, the Cui family secretly sent away a group of important members. Another group was to take a different path, likely to confront the large number of Li family experts who would encircle them.

"Chonghe, you are my child. Our main lineage must bear responsibility. I still need to oversee the overall situation and cannot take that path for now. Your younger brother is still small, not mature and steady enough. You will represent me and take the second path with those clan elders." Cui Father personally spoke. On that night, Cui Father's expression was somewhat complex as he patted his second son's shoulder.

Qin Ming looked at his parents. He knew that the path he was about to take was incredibly dangerous, with a high probability of death, primarily to attract the attention of a large number of Li family experts. The people accompanying him were all the very old elders of the Cui family, those who had only a few years left to live.

"Father, Mother, Brother!" Qin Ming nodded, tears in his eyes, bidding them farewell. He boarded the bronze carriage and, looking back in the darkness of the night, saw only the retreating figures of his parents.

In the inn room, Qin Ming sighed.
