# Chapter 193: Arrival  

After cultivating the *Diamond Body Protection Technique*, Li Shiming began practicing the *Sword Demon Codex*.  

The *Sword Demon Codex* primarily focused on cultivating sword intent during the Foundation Establishment stage. However, Li Shiming could skip this step, allowing him to delve deeper into the cultivation method and bypass the early stages of the Foundation Establishment chapter.  

The third-grade sword foundation transformed into countless tiny short swords, merging into every part of his body.  

Threads of sword intent emanated from these countless tiny swords, stimulating the harmony between his body and the sword intent while deepening the fusion between his body and the third-grade sword foundation.  

The *Sword Demon Codex* nurtured the body with the sword and the sword with the body, allowing both to improve simultaneously.  

Of course, at this stage, it was mainly about nurturing the body with the sword, as his physical constitution still lagged behind the quality of the third-grade sword foundation.  

While practicing the *Sword Demon Codex*, Li Shiming refrained from consuming monkey wine, as his body was already filled with a sense of expansion, and his internal energy was abundant.  

As the cultivation progressed, the feeling of expansion gradually dissipated. When he finished his practice, he was pleasantly surprised to find that his previously bulging muscles had shrunk back, no longer appearing as knotted as before.  

Although his muscles had reduced in size, his physical constitution had improved further. His body was gradually transforming toward the strength of a second-grade spiritual artifact.  

Once he could cultivate the *Sword Demon Codex* to the level of a top-tier second-grade spiritual artifact, he would be able to contend with any Foundation Establishment cultivator using only his physical body, without relying on any spells or magical artifacts.  

---  

Early the next morning, before dawn, Li Shiming left his temporary cave.  

Over the next three days, he proceeded cautiously and fortunately did not encounter any great demons. His journey was relatively smooth, and he arrived at his intended destination without incident.  

The location was marked by three connected mountains. Li Shiming positioned himself on the mountainside of the leftmost peak, separated from the marked location of the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass by another mountain. This ensured he wouldn’t be detected by powerful spirit beasts.  

He launched a drone. Although he planned to wait for Xu Chuan before taking action, he still needed to gather some preliminary intelligence.  

The drone flew over the mountain peak. With its infrared thermal imaging activated, Li Shiming detected numerous small red dots scattered across the target mountain.  

Only one area, with a radius of about a hundred meters, showed no small red dots—instead, there was a single massive red signature. That had to be the guardian spirit beast.  

This discovery reassured Li Shiming. At the very least, the drone, which emitted minimal spiritual energy fluctuations, wouldn’t pose much of a problem as long as it didn’t get too close to the target area.  

His greatest concern was encountering a spirit beast that wouldn’t tolerate any creatures within its territory. In that case, the drone’s presence would immediately alert the guardian spirit beast.  

---  

The drone flying in the air would likely be mistaken for a mere bird unless directly observed by the guardian spirit beast.  

The drone circled the area once, and IBMz15 generated a complete three-dimensional topographic map of the entire region.  

The only unknown factor was the strength of the guardian spirit beast.  

Li Shiming had Nezha dig a deep cave into the mountainside. The thick layers of rock and soil would block the detection of powerful spirit beasts.  

He also set up multiple surveillance devices outside—some positioned on the mountaintop facing the target peak, others aimed in the opposite direction. If Xu Chuan arrived, he would be alerted immediately.  

For five days, Li Shiming remained in the cave, focusing on his body-refining cultivation.  

By the fifth day, Xu Chuan still hadn’t arrived. Li Shiming began to suspect something was wrong.  

Even if Xu Chuan had been moving slowly, he shouldn’t have taken five extra days to arrive.  

Recalling the four-clawed flood dragon that had chased Xu Chuan, Li Shiming silently mourned for him.  

Xu Chuan had been a decent person—someone trustworthy as a friend. Not every cultivator would willingly draw a great demon’s attention to protect others.  

That was true character—revealed in times of adversity.  

"Brother Xu, I’ll do my best to retrieve the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass. But if a great demon is guarding it, I won’t be able to overcome it. Please forgive me," Li Shiming murmured, gazing in the direction Xu Chuan should have come from.  

Over the past few days, he had tried to monitor the guardian spirit beast’s movements, but it had remained stationary the entire time.  

Without getting closer, Li Shiming couldn’t even accurately determine the spirit beast’s strength.  

"First, I need to confirm the guardian spirit beast’s power. Then, I must lure it away to verify whether the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass is still there," he strategized.  

The simplest way to gauge the guardian spirit beast’s strength was to create a significant disturbance. The guardian would inevitably react, revealing its aura and allowing him to assess its power.  

Creating a disturbance was something Li Shiming excelled at.  

He retrieved a 500-gram explosive—a standard military-grade bomb equipped with a full detonation system. Using his spiritual sense, he set the timer.  

The drone carried the explosive to the rightmost of the three peaks before dropping it.  

Once the drone returned, Li Shiming withdrew it, suppressed his aura, and buried himself in the soil, leaving only a trace of spiritual sense outside.  

"Three, two, one!"  

As he counted down in his mind, an explosion erupted.  

---  

The moment the explosion sounded, the thermal imaging surveillance detected the previously solitary heat source rapidly intensifying. A deafening roar followed.  

A massive flaming bear leaped into the air, soaring toward the explosion site.  

A terrifying, violent aura enveloped the entire area. The ground trembled as smaller creatures either died of fright or cowered in fear.  

"A great demon? No—not quite yet!" Li Shiming immediately retracted his spiritual sense after sensing the overwhelming aura. He didn’t want to be detected by the powerful spirit beast.  

The flaming bear wasn’t yet a full-fledged great demon, but its aura far surpassed that of a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

The bear had likely taken a crucial step toward becoming a great demon but hadn’t fully completed its transformation.  

Li Shiming wasn’t entirely confident in his assessment, but one thing was certain—he stood no chance against this flaming bear.  

Even if he combined forces with Li Yuanba, Jiang Chen, and even used a talisman treasure, victory was impossible.  

He began to reconsider. Sacrificing his life for someone else’s cause wasn’t worth it.  

He turned his attention back to the surveillance feed. The flaming bear had reached the explosion site but found no living beings—only the aftermath of the blast.  

Enraged, the bear roared and violently pounded the ground, creating a massive crater.  

"Why is this bear so aggressive?" Li Shiming wondered.  

Having observed many spirit beasts during his journey, he had developed some understanding of their behavior.  

IBMz15 had collected extensive data on spirit beasts, allowing for systematic analysis.  

This bear’s behavior was abnormal even among spirit beasts.  

A typical spirit beast, upon discovering signs of an explosion, would first investigate for additional clues rather than mindlessly destroying the area like this bear.  

"There might be an opportunity here," Li Shiming mused, abandoning his earlier thoughts of retreat.  

After watching the bear return to its original position, he sent the drone out again with another explosive, this time targeting a more distant location.  

He retreated deep into the mountain cave, relying solely on surveillance to monitor the outside.  

Once the drone delivered the explosive, it landed near—but not too close to—the bear’s location.  

Another explosion rang out. The bear reacted just as violently as before, leaping into the air with its flames flaring. Several nearby trees caught fire.  

---  

As the bear flew toward the explosion site, the drone sprang into action. Skimming the ground, it flew toward the area the bear had been guarding.  

The drone’s built-in chip calculated the terrain, constantly adjusting its flight path to minimize the risk of detection.  

Through the drone’s feed, Li Shiming finally got a clear view of the target area.  

The site was surrounded by massive boulders, forming a nest. The drone couldn’t get too close—its sensors triggered a high-temperature alarm.  

Adjusting its angle, the drone finally found a vantage point between the boulders.  

Inside the nest was a massive red rock—or rather, a rock connected to underground fire, with flames occasionally licking its surface.  

Yet, in this harsh environment, a single plant had taken root on the scorching rock.  

Through the drone’s camera, Li Shiming saw the plant clearly—its three jade-red leaves unmistakably identified it as the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass.  

To his surprise, the herb was still there—and nearly mature.  

Xu Chuan had likely chosen this location based on records indicating the herb’s impending maturity.  

Spirit beasts wouldn’t harvest immature spiritual herbs—doing so would be wasteful, as their potency would be significantly weaker.  

Seeing the bear returning via the surveillance feed, Li Shiming quickly set the drone to standby mode, positioning it outside the nest, facing the narrow gap between the boulders.  

The bear’s fury visibly subsided as it entered the nest, though its heavy, controlled breathing betrayed its lingering rage.  

The drone, now acting as a surveillance device, recorded the bear’s every move.  

The bear paid no attention to the drone—unsurprising, as neither cultivators nor spirit beasts in this world seemed to care about objects or creatures without spiritual energy fluctuations.  

To them, such things were beneath notice.  

The bear’s breathing softened as it gazed at the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass. Its massive paw hovered an inch above the herb, as if afraid to touch it.  

Li Shiming realized just how important the herb was to the bear.  

---  

The third-grade Sunward Three-Leaf Grass was likely the key to the bear’s ascension to a great demon.  

Otherwise, why would a near-great demon be so fiercely protective of it?  

Over the next two days, explosions occurred at irregular intervals, each in a different location.  

The bear grew increasingly irritable. Outside its nest, it burned down nearly every tree in the vicinity.  

Fortunately, the drone’s position near the nest spared it from the bear’s rampage.  

According to IBMz15’s analysis of the bear’s temperament, the time was ripe. The bear’s rage had reached a tipping point—it was time to act.  

Li Shiming personally planted timed explosives on the rightmost peak—first one, then another, and another.  

After setting everything up, he returned to the left peak to wait.  

*Boom!*  

Another explosion sent the bear soaring into the air, its fury palpable.  

It flew toward the right peak, its flames scorching the rocks beneath it.  

The bear was on the verge of becoming a great demon—it had already taken the most critical step. All it needed was to consume the third-grade Sunward Yang herb to complete its transformation.  

But something kept harassing it, and it couldn’t figure out what.  

As a being of yang energy, the bear’s temper flared uncontrollably under such provocation.  

Just as it reached the first explosion site, another blast echoed from a slightly farther location.  

Without hesitation, it flew toward the new site.  

Then another explosion—even farther away.  

Li Shiming burst into action, suppressing his spiritual energy to the utmost. Even his sword light was concealed to its limit.  

Speed was of the essence now.  

Based on IBMz15’s data from days of explosions, Li Shiming had carefully calculated the bear’s awareness range around its nest.  

Each time the explosions were slightly farther away, the bear hesitated momentarily before pursuing—a detail visible in the surveillance footage.  

The repeated explosions over two days had conditioned the bear to disregard this hesitation, convincing it subconsciously that the explosions posed no threat to its nest.  

---  

The bear wasn’t yet a true great demon. Though its intelligence matched that of a human, continuous provocation had pushed it into a state of instinctual rage.  

Li Shiming reached the bear’s nest—a crude structure designed solely to conceal the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass from other spirit beasts.  

A third-grade spiritual herb was invaluable to any great demon, and this bear clearly knew it.  

With minimal spiritual energy usage, Li Shiming felt the intense heat radiating from the nest—like standing inside a furnace.
