# Chapter 25: Once You Were Sweetie, Now You're Just Miss Chen!

"Aiya—"

"Senior Sister Chen, are you angry?"

"You mustn't get angry, you know. Anger makes women age faster."

"It's all Xuan'er's fault for making Senior Sister Chen angry."

"Wuwu~"

Dong Xuan'er pretended to sob behind her sleeve.

"You—"

A dark flash streaked through the air as the You Shui Sword appeared in Chen Qiaoqian's hand, its cold edge pressing against Dong Xuan'er's jade-like neck with a stinging sensation.

"The You Shui Sword—a gift Brother Lin gave me years ago."

"And you'd better stay away from Brother Lin, or don't blame me for being ruthless!"

Despite having a sword pressed against her neck, Dong Xuan'er showed not the slightest fear. Instead, she put on an act of pitiful weakness. "Senior Sister Chen, you're so fierce!"

"Xuan'er is so scared~!!"

After her performance, Dong Xuan'er leaned her entire body against Chen Qiaoqian, her peach-blossom eyes narrowing slightly, her delicate eyebrows trembling. "Senior Sister Chen, this man Lin Yun—I've set my sights on him."

"What if you've known him a few years longer than I have?"

"Once you were sweetie, now you're just Miss Chen. The new replaces the old!"

"You—" Chen Qiaoqian's phoenix eyes widened as she glared at Dong Xuan'er's brazen provocation, her hand trembling where it gripped the You Shui Sword.

But then, Chen Qiaoqian took a deep breath, recalling the letter her family had recently sent her. It explicitly instructed her to do everything possible to mend her relationship with Lin Yun—her family fully supported them becoming cultivation partners.

The thought left her with mixed emotions—both joy and bitter resentment.

She was happy that there were finally no more obstacles between her and Lin Yun.

But she was furious—why hadn't her family made this decision sooner?!

If they had supported her back then, would things have come to this?!

If they hadn't threatened Lin Yun's life to force her into a political marriage with that bastard from the Lu family, would this shameless little vixen Dong Xuan'er be able to taunt her like this now?!

"Ah—"

"If only they had known then what they know now..."

Chen Qiaoqian sighed inwardly, sheathing the You Shui Sword. With a sorrowful expression, she turned and walked back to her room on the Tai Yue Flying Boat.

Watching Chen Qiaoqian's dejected retreat, Dong Xuan'er curled her lips into a triumphant smirk.

"Think you're so great?!"

"What's the use of being good at cultivation?!"

"Winning a man's heart is where real skill lies!"

As Chen Qiaoqian's lonely figure disappeared, Dong Xuan'er thought to herself, "Once we reach the Yellow Maple Valley, I'll beg Master to take Lin Yun as a disciple!"

"That way, Brother Lin and I will be an immortal couple—a match made in heaven!"

"Hahaha—"

"What a genius I am!"

---

Night fell.

The journey from Lan Province to the Yellow Maple Valley in Jian Province was still long.

At the bow of the boat, Lin Yun took out a vertical flute from his storage pouch and brought it to his lips. A melancholic melody began to spread outward, sorrowful and haunting.

Like lament, like yearning.

Like weeping, like pleading.

The lingering notes drifted like wisps of silk.

Enough to make hidden dragons dance in dark ravines, to make widows weep in lonely boats.

After playing for a while, the music stopped.

Lin Yun faced the starry sky, the bright moonlight stretching his shadow long behind him.

"Since you're here, come out. After all this time apart, why stand on ceremony?"

"Brother Lin, I..." Chen Qiaoqian stepped out of the shadows, her expression conflicted. She opened her mouth but found herself at a loss for words.

Should she explain what happened back then? The matter with the Lu family?

But what would be the point?

With Lin Yun's intelligence, he must have figured it all out long ago.

Speaking now would only lead to awkward silence.

"Brother Lin... I'm sorry." After a long pause, her eyes dimmed.

"There's nothing to apologize for." Lin Yun turned to her with a gentle smile. "Qiaoqian, your cultivation has improved greatly over the years. It seems you've been diligent."

"Much has happened these years." Lin Yun turned away again, sighing. "I've come to understand many things."

"The Chen family raised you. Though you may have lost your freedom, you also gained what others spend their lives chasing—pills, techniques, magical tools, talismans."

"Perhaps you weren't wrong. Perhaps the Chen family wasn't wrong."

"The only mistake was that we were too weak, our cultivation too low."

"If I had been a Core Formation cultivator back then, would any of this have happened?!"

Lin Yun tilted his head back at a forty-five-degree angle, gazing at the night sky.

His voice carried endless melancholy.

After a moment, he turned and extended a hand to Chen Qiaoqian. "Qiaoqian, this time... are you still willing to help me?!"

"I am! Brother Lin!" Chen Qiaoqian stepped forward, pressing a hand to her chest in excitement. "Brother Lin, I am!"

"Whatever you desire, everything I have is yours!"

"Brother Lin, this time, I'll support you with all my strength!"

She rushed forward and embraced him. "Brother Lin, let me make it up to you!"

"Brother Lin, let's go inside. Everything about me is yours!"

"Ah, this girl's lovestruck brain is beyond saving..." Lin Yun thought to himself, inwardly sweating at how easily Chen Qiaoqian had fallen for it. If she lived in his previous world, she'd definitely be the type to binge-watch those toxic romance dramas—the kind where the female lead torments the male lead, only to chase him desperately later.

"Lucky for her she met a good man like me."

"Perfect timing to test out my pseudo-Yin Yang Great Five Elements True Body and see what it can do!"

---

The next day, the sun was already high in the sky.

Dong Xuan'er looked around curiously. "Huh? Where's Brother Lin?"

At that moment, Lin Yun was sitting cross-legged on his bed, using internal vision to examine the faint white strand of energy that had appeared in his body. Though it appeared white at a glance, closer inspection revealed hints of other colors, with faint five-colored glimmers flickering weakly across its surface.

"Is this the Yin Yang Great Five Elements True Light?"

Lin Yun recalled the details about this energy.

The Yin Yang Great Five Elements True Light was said to be capable of merging with any cultivation technique or divine ability, even earning the title "Mother of All Methods."

Its physical form was unstable—sometimes appearing as an unremarkable rock, other times as an ordinary piece of deadwood.

Han Li first encountered it within a demonic gold ore purchased in the Blood Crow City of the Demon Realm. The full details came from the linen-clad girl at the Broad Origin Pavilion by the Blue Waterfall Lake.

Legend held that during ancient times in the Demon Realm, there was once an Ancestor who possessed this True Light.

By integrating it into his demonic arts, its amplifying effects allowed him to overpower two other Ancestors of equal standing single-handedly, nearly conquering the entire Demon Realm.

But during an interdimensional journey, he mysteriously vanished.

"Impressive, but if I recall correctly, that Demon Realm Ancestor's strength wasn't just from the True Light—he also cultivated the Heaven-Piercing Demon Art, hailed as the Demon Realm's supreme technique."

Lin Yun mused to himself. "Well, no point worrying about that now."

He examined the wisp of True Light again and frowned. "Such a tiny strand... Even if the Yin Yang Great Five Elements True Light is powerful, this little amount won't be of much use."

His gaze then fell on Chen Qiaoqian.

"It seems I'll have to accumulate it slowly, bit by bit."

"Also, my 'fish farming' project needs to expand. At this rate, this tiny amount of True Light won't get me anywhere!"

"Qiaoqian! I need your help in my cultivation!"

"Brother Yun, don't stop!"
