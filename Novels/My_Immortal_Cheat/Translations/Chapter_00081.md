Chapter 81: Battle Buddha!

Zhou Tian and the others exchanged glances, their expressions grim. They had heard the sounds from outside clearly, knowing a major change had occurred. Everyone rushed out of the cabin.

Reaching the deck, they witnessed the scene: monstrous beasts roared, and four unparalleled figures stood in the void, gazing at them with cold indifference. An invincible expert had even swept a spear across their four strong cultivators, and the bleeding Buddha body floating in the void sent chills down their spines!

"It's over, it's over! We're all going to die here today!" someone cried, their Dao Heart collapsing, face filled with terror, aura fluctuating wildly, looking utterly deranged. They had been scared out of their wits.

"Disrupting morale, death!" Zhou Ying let out a sharp cry. The Black Jade Qilin on her shoulder leaped up, its head growing to an immense size, eyes like bronze bells, and its maw gaping wide. It swallowed the shouting person in one gulp.

The Black Jade Qilin shrank back to palm-size and returned to Zhou Ying's shoulder. "Don't panic! We will get you out safely, but if anyone dares to spread fear and disrupt morale, don't blame me for being merciless!" Although even it didn't quite believe its own words, at this moment, their own formation absolutely could not falter.

"Your Excellency, please act quickly. Heavenly Pass will surely make a move once they discover they can't contact them!" the Shadow God Lord said sinisterly.

"I have my own judgment!" the spear-wielding mighty figure spoke, his palm and fingers shining brilliantly as he struck at the group.

Purple Qi Daoist's face paled, his forehead almost splitting. Seeing this world-shattering palm strike, he pulled out a scroll of Daoist texts. The scroll burst with golden light, slowly unfurling. A character imbued with Dao principles leaped out, forming a magnificent symbol. At the same time, he shouted, "By offending Jiuzhou like this, aren't you afraid of our retaliation later?" He could tell that this person was not from Jiuzhou but from a force within the Star Realm.

"First, consider how you can survive under my hand before you speak!"

The Grand Dao boomed, and the symbol formed by the Daoist texts temporarily blocked the opponent's dazzling palm, but only temporarily. A clear cracking sound resounded. The spear-wielding mighty figure did not use his Dharmakaya, yet his palm was as massive as a mountain. Although it had been weakened by the Daoist texts, even so, the four people's bodies still cracked open, blood spurting out.

The figure in the black-gold mech had a slit open on his back, spraying blood-red tail flames. Using the thrust, he flew towards the eight warships, while roaring, "Warman, Battle Buddha!"

Warman on the warship didn't hesitate for a moment. He quickly pulled out a silver box and threw it with all his might!

The Dao Lord mighty figure frowned slightly, his spear tip moving slightly to point directly at the black-gold mech. A chilling killing intent enveloped the mech. Even though the mech was a Heavenly King-grade battle armor, it gave him no sense of security. Seeing the silver box within reach, he gnashed his teeth and roared, "Everyone, help me!"

He didn't need to say more. The others instantly understood that he likely had a trump card. Enduring their injuries, runes surged forth, and magic treasures soared across the sky, buying him time.

"Roar!" The Tusked Warrior roared, his body expanding to become a thousand-zhang blood wolf, its muscles grotesque, its entire being seething with blood qi. Two blood horns glowed as it charged towards the bronze divine spear.

As the two collided, immense energy exploded, vaporizing the void.

*Crack!* A clear cracking sound resounded; the blood horns shattered, and the blood wolf was sent flying back, reforming into human shape. Blood trickled from his forehead, his face was like golden paper, and his breath was as faint as a wisp of smoke.

Such a terrifying strike, yet it failed to shake the long spear, not even delaying it for an instant.

"Grandfather!" On the deck, Wei Chuan couldn't help but shout, his face filled with worry, blood light swirling around him. From his tone, the figure who transformed into the blood wolf was actually his grandfather.

The other two also unleashed their divine abilities and magic treasures, but it was all in vain. The Dao Lord mighty figure attacked with full force, the spear tip exhaling chaotic qi, moving relentlessly forward.

The silver box thrown by Warman drifted, shimmering with silver light. The black-gold mech sped forward at full throttle, but the divine spear was already close, about to pierce its body.

Zhou Tian glanced at Tian Ling, then at Zhou Ying, and then at the nearby people. All of them watched the battle in the void with nervous expressions, as it virtually determined their life and death. Everyone was nearly despairing; Dao Lords were simply too terrifying.

Zhou Tian sighed, "Looks like I still have to be the one to save the day at a critical moment."

"Still!"

A crisp sound rang out. Everyone turned their gaze to Zhou Tian, only to see him extending his palm, facing the Dao Lord mighty figure in the void. The [Sacred Word], guaranteed to hit due to being buffed by death counts, descended.

"Impossible!" This thought surfaced in everyone's minds, but then they couldn't help but think, "What if..."

An incredible scene unfolded in the void. The spear-wielding mighty figure's movement of swinging his divine spear paused for an instant. Although it was only an instant, it was enough.

"Battle Buddha!"

In that single instant, the black-gold mech obtained the silver box. Unique energy poured in, and the silver box shone brightly, an invisible shield blocking the continuously thrusting divine spear.

"Dao Lords are still too strong," Zhou Tian sighed, disappointed that the [Sacred Word] could only restrain for an instant.

The crowd looked at him strangely. Prodigies like Immortal Banished and Nan Qing had divine light bursting from their eyes, their pupil techniques swirling. Hearing his words, they were all speechless. *What's with that disappointed tone?!*

However, what made Zhou Tian most comfortable was the slightly worshipful look in Tian Ling's eyes beside him. He playfully scratched Tian Ling's delicate nose and chuckled, "How about that? Isn't your fiancé amazing?"

The others' gazes shifted away unnaturally. *We can marvel at your power, but we absolutely will not eat your dog food!*

In the void, *clanking* and *whirring* sounds resounded as metal plates attached themselves to the black-gold mech. Though the silver box didn't seem large, the metal gushing out of it was seemingly endless. In an instant, a colossal figure, ten thousand zhang tall, appeared in the void, seated cross-legged, hands clasped together. Its entire body radiated golden light, its face benevolent, its head bald with nine circular burnt marks from incense. Behind it floated nine gigantic orbs, like stars. The sounds of living beings chanting resounded, as if a Buddhist Pure Land had descended upon the world.

Everyone watched the Buddha-like figure in awe.

"Holy hell, this is going to heaven!" Zhou Tian was also shocked; the fact that it was entirely mechanical in construction astonished him even more.

A group of monks from Luotian Temple almost spat blood. Although it looked like a Buddha descending, what was with those rivets all over the Buddha-like figure's body? Did they have such a deep grudge against them? If it weren't for this moment of life and death, they would have certainly smacked them in the face with a shoehorn.

"Hm?!" The Dao Lord mighty figure turned his gaze towards Zhou Tian. An inexplicable power had just restricted his movements. Although his face was shrouded in chaotic mist, Zhou Tian could still feel his gaze. If not for the protective formation outside the ancient ship, he probably could have glared Zhou Tian to death with a single look.
