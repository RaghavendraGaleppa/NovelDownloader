# Chapter 156: Armor of the Demon Lord

This was a divine ability. Originally, Zhou Tian couldn't cultivate it himself and didn't possess any divine abilities. However, the ancient ruler in his hand was a Heavenly Venerable artifact with a lingering artifact spirit. It was not just a powerful weapon; it also bore the imprint of its former master. Now, the ancient ruler merely unleashed its power through Zhou Tian's hand.

As Zhou Tian gazed at the shining river of righteous energy in the void, he realized it was clearly an amplified version of the divine ability Zheng Yusheng had used that day. The owner of this ancient ruler was, in all likelihood, the creator of that very divine ability. This made him feel a touch of emotion. Just days ago, he had forcefully suppressed Zheng Yusheng, and now he was fighting alongside what could be considered his ancestor's weapon. Indeed, the world was full of unpredictable changes.

The King of Gods' face turned grim. Like Zhou Tian, he wasn't sure how long the opponent's power could last. That was why he had just provoked Zhou Tian with words, hoping to end the battle as quickly as possible. Otherwise, if the alien energy was truly so weak, he would have long since crushed Zhou Tian directly. But now, with Zhou Tian wielding the ancient ruler and his battle prowess soaring, defeating him within a limited time would be even more challenging.

"Dark Reincarnation!" the King of Gods roared, his eyes turning crimson-black, his hair intertwining with the void. Scarlet flames enveloped his entire body, making him resemble a Demon Lord from hell. Subsequently, the boundless void shattered, forming terrifying black cracks, their destinations unknown. Clang, clang! Masses of dark light burst forth from these cracks, gathering around the King of Gods. They then attached themselves to him, revealing a set of ancient black armor. It was etched with profound patterns, and despite being damaged and having drifted in this void for countless years, it still exuded immense power!

The armor bore traces of blood and holes, appearing incredibly ancient. At the King of Gods' summons, the black armor began to glow intensely, then erupted with monstrous black mist. In an instant, the entire void was shrouded in black clouds, which were the dense, intractable power of primordial darkness. In the darkness, his body was almost invisible, only a gaunt, slender silhouette remained. Yet, his eyes grew increasingly bright, like two crimson suns in the darkness, dazzling and terrifying. The next moment, he took a step, tearing through the void, carrying boundless pressure as he strode towards Zhou Tian!

In an instant, the void boiled, and then great waves of primordial darkness spread out, surging towards the high heavens. Shrouded in dark light, the King of Gods' aura became utterly terrifying, completely devoid of any divine sanctity.

"The Demon Lord's Armor! How is this possible? Why can he summon it?!" Yan Mo's expression drastically changed. Many things today had exceeded their expectations. The armor now adorning the King of Gods was none other than the Demon Lord's Armor. Being high-ranking figures in their respective forces, they naturally knew about the Demon Realm. More critically, this armor was also a Heavenly Venerable artifact.

"Many things are still hidden here!" Zhou Changsheng's face darkened. Although the God-forsaken Land had been under their control since the Ancient War, it now appeared that this place, once considered merely a corner of the God Realm, was far from simple.

The King of Gods, clad in black armor and enveloped in dark power, descended from the sky. Only the golden ancient spear in his hand emitted a dazzling golden radiance. His dharma body was colossal, intent on directly crushing Zhou Tian to death!

"Are you... transforming?" Zhou Tian was utterly astonished. The shining river of righteous energy surged backward, stirring up countless waves, and even phantom figures leaped from the river, attacking the King of Gods. The King of Gods' expression was grim, his eyes subtly tinged with madness. He had summoned the former Demon Lord's Armor through a special method to enhance his battle prowess, but he was inevitably affected by it. Ignoring Zhou Tian's question, he swung his golden ancient spear, splitting the immense river of righteous energy, and advanced towards Zhou Tian with an unstoppable momentum.

Clang! Zhou Tian's ancient ruler struck horizontally. The golden ancient spear pierced the ruler, emitting a clang of metal against metal. The mere aftershock of the sound caused the surrounding void to tremble incessantly. Failing to land a hit, the King of Gods shifted from thrusting to cleaving, like an ordinary mortal in a duel. Yet, each move contained his Dao and Dharma, condensed to their utmost limits. The void exploded, and spatial storms raged, but not a single hair on either of their bodies stirred. Zhou Tian wielded the ruler as a sword. The ancient ruler's master was an ancient powerful expert from the Confucian Academy of the Grand Luo Institute. While the Confucian Academy's swordsmanship wasn't top-tier, it was far from weak. Now, using the ruler as a sword, he unleashed one, or perhaps a thousand, streaks of sword light, weaving them into a net. The King of Gods' armor became even deeper in color, seemingly absorbing nearby light, as his golden ancient spear flashed, shattering all the sword lights.

Bang! The ancient spear struck the ruler, sending Zhou Tian flying directly backward. The King of Gods' strength had once again increased; though he hadn't reached the Heavenly Venerable realm, he was significantly stronger than before. Zhou Tian spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes flickering uncertainly. His time was now less than ten seconds. Both sides were half-step Heavenly Venerable existences. Divine abilities and battles could happen in an instant. Although they had exchanged many blows, only a little over twenty seconds had actually passed. Chaos raged, the void churned, spear light turned eternal, and laws intertwined into a heaven-and-earth net. The area was filled with shimmering light and mist, dazzling yet incredibly terrifying.

"Pfft!" The golden ancient spear pierced through Zhou Tian's shoulder, glinting with a chilling cold light. At the same time, the ancient ruler in Zhou Tian's hand struck the King of Gods' ribs, letting out a crisp crack like chaotic thunder. The King of Gods' body wavered slightly as Zhou Tian's energy wreaked havoc within him. Both of them were fighting with true fervor, or perhaps both knew their time was running out and aimed to finish off the opponent, or at least cripple them, within the limited time available!

"So many years have passed, the so-called God Realm has long since fallen apart! Why are you still so fixated on rebuilding it?" Zhou Tian tried to disrupt the King of Gods' state of mind, raising his right hand to parry the King of Gods' ancient spear, his arm wreathed in a thunder dragon.

"Die!" The King of Gods had no desire to speak further. His crimson-black eyes held chilling killing intent. The black armor on his body continuously supplied him with power. He simply wanted to crush this lingering threat he had left behind with his own hands.

Crack! With a crisp bone-shattering sound, Zhou Tian's arm bone was shattered. However, the lightning coiling around his hand also struck the King of Gods through the ancient spear. Meanwhile, the ancient ruler in his left hand emitted a brilliant white light, empowered by the blessings of various Sages. Although it was gripped by the King of Gods, it still caused his form to waver slightly. The two were clearly trading blows, injury for injury. Zhou Tian, with his cheat ability, had no fear, while the King of Gods, having already died once, naturally went all out. Everyone watched the two colossal gods battling in the void, their hearts in their throats. Tian Ling's slender hands were clenched tightly, her lower lip bitten, her eyes already misting over with tears.
