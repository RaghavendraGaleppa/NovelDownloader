# Chapter 61: Mysterious Matters and a Hint of Fragrance

Having made his decision, Qi Chuan wasted no time. He immediately took out paper and brush to transcribe the contents, completing it shortly after and binding it into a booklet.

"With this copy made, the next question is how to deliver it," Qi Chuan murmured thoughtfully.

Given the precious nature of the Lesser Mystic Crystal Jade Body technique, entrusting it to someone else was out of the question—it simply wasn't safe. It seemed he would have to personally visit the Outer Sect.

Fortunately, Qi Chan'er had told him the location of her residence in the Outer Sect when they parted ways at the entrance of the Wind Moon Sect after their journey in the Cloudrise Mountains.

Thus, Qi Chuan left his upper-tier first-grade cave abode and headed toward the Outer Sect of the Wind Moon Sect.

Though the Outer Sect, like the Inner Sect, occupied an area within the mountains surrounding Wind Moon Lake, its territory was much larger. However, with far more disciples, the spiritual energy concentration in the Outer Sect's peaks was significantly weaker compared to the Inner Sect.

As an outsider entering the Outer Sect, Qi Chuan had to go through the Outer Sect Hall. After leaving the Inner Sect's territory, he made his way directly there.

The Outer Sect Hall was located at the entrance of the Outer Sect's domain. When Qi Chuan, clad in the attire of an Inner Sect disciple, appeared outside the hall, the people inside quickly noticed. A plump middle-aged steward soon emerged.

"May I ask the purpose of this Inner Sect junior brother's visit to the Outer Sect Hall?" the steward inquired after offering a respectful sect greeting.

The steward addressed Qi Chuan as "junior brother" because he was no ordinary Outer Sect member. Having once been an Inner Sect disciple himself, he had taken up this position after failing to advance to the Core Sect and reaching the limit of his time as an Inner Sect disciple. Thus, his form of address was appropriate.

However, Qi Chuan was a young Inner Sect disciple with untapped potential—a candidate for the Core Sect. Even if he were to step down in the future, his position would likely be no lower than the steward's. As such, the steward treated Qi Chuan as an equal, if not with slightly more deference.

"Ah, Steward Senior Brother, I'm here to visit someone in the Outer Sect," Qi Chuan replied with a smile, recognizing the steward's background and reciprocating the respectful address.

"If it's a visit, a simple registration in the hall will suffice," the steward said, leading Qi Chuan inside to complete the formalities.

Afterward, the steward personally escorted Qi Chuan to Qi Chan'er's residence, as basic information about Outer Sect disciples was recorded in the Outer Sect Hall.

Soon, they arrived at a spiritual peak deep within the Outer Sect. From the mountainside to the summit, small two-story pavilions were scattered across the peak. Unlike Inner Sect disciples, who had private cave abodes, Outer Sect disciples resided in these pavilions, which varied in number depending on the spiritual energy distribution of each peak. Some peaks had only one or two pavilions, while others housed dozens. In truth, there was little difference in quality between them.

Qi Chan'er's pavilion was located near the summit.

"I wonder if she's even here," Qi Chuan suddenly thought. Qi Chan'er was known for her unwavering dedication to cultivation, often taking on missions—so much so that she was practically a mission addict. 

Unlike him, who only did the bare minimum—three simple, safe missions a year with decent rewards—and had since dropped even the "decent rewards" requirement after becoming a high-grade talisman master, Qi Chan'er was always on the move. If she happened to be away, this trip would be for nothing.

"Outer Sect disciple Qi Chan'er, are you in your pavilion?" the steward called out as they reached the summit.

The commotion drew the attention of other Outer Sect disciples on the peak, some stepping out of their pavilions or peering from second-floor windows. Spotting Qi Chuan's Inner Sect robes, their expressions flickered with surprise—it was rare for an Inner Sect disciple to visit their peak.

"What is it?" A clear, melodious voice came from the pavilion in front of the steward.

The door on the first floor opened, and Qi Chan'er stepped out, her delicate face etched with confusion. Her gaze first fell on the steward, then shifted to the young man in Inner Sect robes standing behind him—his calm, handsome features unmistakable.

"Qi Chuan?" 

Her eyes widened in astonishment. She hadn't expected Qi Chuan to come looking for her in the Outer Sect.

"I need to discuss something with you," Qi Chuan said without preamble.

"What is it?" she asked, puzzled.

"This isn't the place. Let's talk inside." Given the sensitivity of the Lesser Mystic Crystal Jade Body technique, discussing it openly was out of the question. Though her pavilion wasn't a cave abode, it still had formations to shield it from prying eyes and ears.

"Alright." Though still confused, Qi Chan'er didn't question him further. She turned and led him inside, closing the door behind them and cutting off the curious gazes outside.

The steward chuckled to himself and left without another word, heading back to the Outer Sect Hall.

"An Inner Sect male disciple came to visit that pretty junior sister at the summit?"

"And they went inside... and closed the door!"

The other Outer Sect disciples exchanged glances, their imaginations running wild with speculation.

Meanwhile, inside Qi Chan'er's pavilion, the moment the door shut, a faint blush crept onto her fair cheeks. 

She had just done something rather bold—bringing a male cultivator into her residence and closing the door mysteriously. The other Outer Sect disciples were bound to gossip. 

But seeing Qi Chuan's unperturbed expression, she wondered if she was overthinking it. Perhaps this was perfectly normal. Given his personality, if he had come all this way to see her in secret, there must be a good reason.

"Qi Chuan, what's this about?" she asked, her cheeks still slightly flushed but her tone serious.

As soon as he entered, Qi Chuan caught a faint whiff of a delicate, floral fragrance—her natural scent. It tickled his nose, making him suddenly aware of the intimacy of the situation. 

But there was no helping it. The Lesser Mystic Crystal Jade Body was too important to risk exposure.

Without changing his expression, he reached into his robe and pulled out a manual—the transcription of the Lesser Mystic Crystal Jade Body technique.

The booklet was pristine and neatly bound, its cover bearing the five characters for "Lesser Mystic Crystal Jade Body," written in Qi Chuan's own hand with his high-grade Mystic Elephant Brush. The strokes carried a faint trace of talismanic artistry.

"Oh, it's nothing much. I just brought you this," he said calmly, handing her the manual.
