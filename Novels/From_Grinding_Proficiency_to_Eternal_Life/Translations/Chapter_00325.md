# Chapter 325: Organ Refinement!

When the Demon Lords ran rampant back then, Patriarch Pureyang used the Nine Heavens Thunder Method to defeat eighteen demon lords in a row.

What is even more legendary is that the three stances of the "Pureyang Sword Art" left behind by the Patriarch a hundred days before his ascension are still the ultimate sect-defining arts of the Dao Sect. They only reveal their true meaning at the Purple Qi Pavilion on Clear Mist Mountain once every sixty years.

Only those who have cultivated the Pureyang Qi Technique to perfection have a chance to comprehend them.

Xu Yunfan subconsciously touched a silk scroll inside his robe.

It was something Bi Yuan had stuffed into him when he descended the mountain, claiming it to be the subsequent cultivation method for the Pureyang Qi Technique, containing the three stances of the sword art.

"Did Patriarch Pureyang truly ascend?"

Listening to Xu Yunfan's question, Bi Sheng stroked the ancient scroll. "The story of Patriarch Pureyang's ascension..."

He curled his lips into a meaningful arc. "Your master, Bi Yuan, has always scoffed at it, believing it to be nothing more than a legend fabricated by the Dao Sect to intimidate the world."

"Then why is Martial Uncle Bi taking the risk to obtain this *Mysterious Heaven Treasure Catalog*?"

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't believe Bi Sheng would do something useless.

"The spiritual energy of the earth's veins surged only three years ago. The recovery of spiritual energy compressed the timeline of the Demon Lords' invasion from three hundred years in the future to the present moment... We cannot wait for the spiritual energy to recede again. It is dangerous, yet it is also an opportunity that is almost certainly a dead end if not taken."

Speaking of this, Bi Sheng's expression was complex.

"But this scroll is the only method in the world that can utilize spiritual energy to cultivate true qi, even if it is just the crudest Qi Condensation Art. This *Mysterious Heaven Treasure Catalog* is a genuine Qi Condensation Art. With spiritual energy present, it allows someone with no strength to bind a chicken to cultivate true qi."

Xu Yunfan's expression shook slightly. "Is this a cultivation method?"

"Yes, and no."

Bi Sheng shook his head slightly. "After researching for so many years, the Dao Sect has come to the conclusion that this is merely a Qi Condensation Art. It can't even be called Qi Cultivation. After two hundred years of research, the Dao Sect saw through it—this is just a Qi Condensation technique used by the Demon Lords to cultivate blood food. Now that your master wants the original, he must have made some new discovery... It's a case of 'giving it a try to see if there's a枣 [date] or not.'"

He paused, then Bi Sheng said in a deep voice, "First, memorize these contents."

The sound of patrol bells from the Black Armor Guards came from outside the window. Bi Sheng pinched his fingers, calculating the time.

"Cui Yu will come to retrieve the treasure catalog at the third quarter of the Yin hour."

He glanced at the *Sky-Piercing Cloud Bow* hanging diagonally across Xu Yunfan's shoulder, its light restrained. "You are currently carrying two divine weapons from the Sword Burial Abyss. In the Imperial Capital, you are a live target. Walking out there is just fishing for trouble. Don't show yourself until the Martial Examination begins."

Xu Yunfan asked in surprise, "You really want me to participate in the Martial Exam?"

"You are of the right age." Bi Sheng threw out a sentence, then added, "Furthermore, this is a necessary step... Your master is probably gathering several Grand Elders to open the Dharma Altar."

Xu Yunfan naturally knew that the purpose of this ritual was to allow him to break through the shackles of martial arts rapidly and step into the Ninth Realm. If not for the recovery of the spiritual energy and the Dao Sect's secret technique to open the Dharma Altar and manipulate the earth's veins, this shocking feat would be impossible to accomplish.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh. "Nowadays, the Great Zhou is truly a dish served on the table, waiting for everyone to take a bite."

Bi Sheng snorted coldly. "You profit yet complain... Only after this can the Great Zhou be reborn from the ashes. Your junior martial brother, Haomiao, might be able to重登龙位 [ascend the dragon throne] and gather the essence of the world again."

In the following days, Xu Yunfan hastily memorized the *Spirit Eating Art* recorded in the *Mysterious Heaven Treasure Catalog* and set it aside.

He turned his entire focus to the cultivation of the *Ten Extreme Martial Dao*.

On the exotic beast hide left by Dugu Jiu, ten types of qi were like ten coiling dragons inhabiting the human flesh, muscles, meridians, bones, and organs, completely encompassing the entire human body. There was even a type of qi that charged through the mysterious pass to open the orifices, transforming into劲 [force] to enter the brain.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged, his abdomen rumbling like thunder.

The Heavenly Gang Qi was fierce like thunder, the Earthly Evil Qi was long and continuous like water, the Profound Yin Qi was piercingly cold... Each type of qi corresponded to specific organs and orifice cycles.

What was most astonishing was the tenth type, the Primordial Chaos Qi. It required forcibly blending the previous nine types of qi at their intersection points. If one was slightly careless, their body would explode.

"No wonder Dugu Jiu said this was a martial dao that melts and casts a hundred scriptures..."

It truly was melting and casting a hundred scriptures, but it was too deformed. If not for the fact that it could indeed encompass various supreme arts after being practiced, and had the attribute panel's certification, Xu Yunfan wouldn't have wanted to touch it at all.

Xu Yunfan stared intently at a proficiency increase prompt popping up on his attribute panel.

An ordinary martial artist would need ten years of bitter effort to understand the operation of a single type of qi. But right now, ten three-dimensional meridian models were synchronously presented in his mind. The Nine Stars Qi moved through flesh like fierce horses galloping, the Meridian Cleansing Qi permeated along the bones like a stream, encompassing even the flow of the tiniest blood vessel branches.

If not for the attribute panel, Xu Yunfan really couldn't have completed it.

The Nine Stars Spirit Eating Art, Dragon and Tiger Heavenly Gang, Pureyang Qi, Meridian Cleansing—the qi cultivated from these top-tier supreme arts began to continuously condense within his body.

At the third hour of the Tiger period on the third day, Xu Yunfan suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood containing ice shards. He quickly glanced at an information prompt appearing in his vision.

*'You are cultivating the Ten Extreme Martial Dao. You seem to have found a slight key point. Proficiency +1'*

*'...'*

As the proficiency deepened, the memories regarding the cultivation of the Ten Extreme Martial Dao became increasingly profound. He discovered that the true secret of the Ten Extreme Martial Dao lay not in practicing the ten qi separately, but in the dynamic balance formed by using the Primordial Chaos Qi cultivated from the Void Clear Sword Art as a hub.

*'Your Ten Extreme Martial Dao has entered the Initial Stage.'*

The moment the ten types of qi in Xu Yunfan's body formed a perfect cycle under the command of the Primordial Chaos Qi, an entry prompt regarding the Initial Stage quickly popped up on the attribute panel.

He only had time to glance at it before the sound of dense jade chimes suddenly erupted from his bones.

The originally scattered ten streams of qi, like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, condensed into a drop of chaotic-colored qi at the flesh and navel. This was the unique "Primordial Chaos True Seed" of the *Ten Extreme Martial Dao*.

Once the True Seed is formed, the Ten Extremes are truly reached.

As the system infused large amounts of warm currents to fill his body, the spine, the great dragon, erupted with crisp sounds of metal and stone clashing one segment after another. A jade-like luster spread along the vertebrae to the four limbs and hundred bones.

Thunder patterns outlined by the Meridian Cleansing Qi appeared on the surface of the ribs. Every breath caused chest resonance, shaking the dust off the green bricks of the quiet room.

After the metallic marrow fluid seeped into the bone marrow, it actually formed honeycomb-like air chambers inside the bones. This was a sign recorded in the *Ten Extreme Martial Dao* of the initial completion of Jade Marrow Golden Bones.

The large tendons rang out like bowstrings. Under the scouring of the warm currents, the muscle fibers rapidly split and reorganized. Scaly crystals appeared under the skin, making his tempered body even more terrifying.

When Xu Yunfan tried to bend his elbow, his biceps automatically contracted into a perfect streamlined arc, as if it were hundred-forged fine steel that had gone through countless hammerings.

Immediately after, the sound of his heart beating was like a war drum rumbling, pumping blood mixed with qi to his entire body.

At this time, the qi began to transform into his kidneys, and qi slowly adhered to the surface of his liver.

This was the stage where the organs began to gradually withstand the qi.

Xu Yunfan was naturally overjoyed to see this. For an ordinary martial artist to have qi transform into their organs, they need to accumulate it year after year, bit by bit, allowing the five organs and six bowels to gradually adapt and be strengthened. Only after adaptation, under the influence of the five elements of the five organs, transforming the force into Gang, can one truly enter the Organ Refinement realm.

*(Apologies everyone, it's late today. Only two chapters for now, I'll work hard tomorrow! The groundwork is laid, the climax begins next!)*
