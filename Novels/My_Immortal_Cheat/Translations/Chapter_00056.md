# Chapter 56: Kneel!

“These things prove nothing. They are from your country; you can easily force them to falsely accuse us!”

A man behind Scholar Li stepped forward and spoke. He was the leader of those few people, and his eyes glinted with triumph. This was their pre-arranged strategy: deny everything!

Scholar Li frowned but said nothing. At this point, there was no other option.

“Deny everything? No problem…”

Zhou Tian shook his head and chuckled, amused. Triumphant? Good, the more triumphant they were now, the more complete their despair would be in the end!

“I have other evidence…”

The man’s heart skipped a beat, and a sense of panic surged within him. However, he had reviewed everything countless times in the VIP room earlier; besides human witnesses, they had left no other evidence whatsoever.

“Young Master Zhou, if it’s still just witness testimony, don’t bother. A one-sided account proves nothing. These people might have been incited by certain individuals, and their words can’t be trusted!”

Tie Niu, from the side, stepped forward and said. Although there was severe open and covert infighting within Daluo Academy due to its power structure, unity was still necessary for now.

Zhou Tian ignored their words and once again pulled out a glowing jade slip from his embrace, tossing it to Zhou Shu.

Zhou Shu unfolded the projection within the jade slip. It was precisely the projection Zi Xu had given Zhou Tian that day!

The people opposite them saw the projection, their pupils constricted, sweat poured down their faces, their expressions filled with disbelief. They couldn’t help but exclaim,

“How is this possible, we…”

“Young Master Zhou, may we verify the authenticity of this projection!”

Seeing his ‘pig teammates’ behind him about to incriminate themselves, Zi Qing frowned and interrupted their continued speech!

“Of course…”

Zhou Tian didn’t regret it. Nine times out of ten, those people were about to say that they had blurring formations on them, making it impossible to be recorded. If they really wanted to quibble, there was no way to explain anything.

He handed the jade slip to Scholar Li. Zhou Tian wasn’t afraid they would destroy the evidence; with a Great Emperor standing right there, they had to weigh their actions carefully!

Scholar Li took the jade slip, activated the internal projection formation, and after observing it carefully for a while, frowned and said,

“This is indeed a scene extracted from a Saint King’s divine soul.”

He himself was a Saint King, so he naturally possessed this discernment. This was merely to identify the authenticity of the projection, not to carefully examine the formations within, so he didn’t discover the parts Zhou Shu had tampered with.

The faces of those behind Scholar Li instantly turned deathly pale, their lips trembling, unable to speak. How could there be a Saint King? How could there be a Saint King?

“However, this does not rule out the possibility of fabrication!”

Scholar Li sighed and spoke these words against his conscience. It was indeed possible to fabricate it; one could modify the Saint King’s memory directly before the Saint King extracted the memory. However, doing so would damage the Saint King’s divine soul, very likely crippling a Saint King!

No one would be willing to pay the price of crippling a Saint King to frame a few people in the Dharma Aspect Realm, not even Tian Qin.

But he couldn’t just watch these few people behind him die here. After all, they were all students of Daluo Academy, and he had brought them himself.

After Scholar Li spoke these words, those few people behind him visibly breathed a sigh of relief. This was truly a rollercoaster of emotions!

“Scholar Li, do you believe that yourself?” Zhou Tian sneered.

“No matter what, with my cultivation, I cannot discern whether this projection has been tampered with. Let’s wait until higher-ranking individuals from my academy arrive to make a final decision.”

Scholar Li could only stick to this point, waiting for people from his own faction to arrive to argue further. By then, even if it was determined to be true, their lives should still be spared!

“Li Lingyi, you are an elder and an academician of Daluo Academy. I respect you for that. But I never expected you to be so depraved, with evidence so clear, yet you still refuse to admit it. This is simply too deceitful!”

Zhou Tian roared, taking a step forward, his black hair stirring without wind, his eyes fixed on Li Lingyi. This was the academician Li’s true name.

Li Lingyi’s face also filled with anger. He was from the same era as Zhou Yi, and although not as dazzling as Zhou Yi, he was still a recognizable figure. Now, to be pointed at and scolded by a mere young brat, the resentment in his heart was hard to suppress.

An overwhelming aura erupted, the chanting of ancient texts echoed, and behind him, a series of phantom figures holding classics appeared, some lying, some sitting. It was a pure land of scholars, righteousness spanning three thousand miles, tongues blooming like lotuses.

“Zhou Tian! You merely have a good father. What right do you have to speak to me like this? When your father and I competed, you didn’t even know where you were!”

Although Li Lingyi’s aura was overwhelming, Zhou Tian was shielded by Zhou Shu and felt nothing. He embraced Tian Ling in his arms, slowly took two steps forward, and sneered,

“What right? Old fossil, I’ll show you what right!”

“Kneel!”

The [Sacred Edict], empowered by the number of deaths, activated. An inexplicable mighty power descended.

Thud!

Under the incredulous gazes of the entire arena and all of Futian Province, Li Lingyi’s knees intimately contacted the stage. The vast righteousness behind him and the phantom figures of the scholars appeared so ironic at this moment!

“Teacher Li!”

“Teacher Li!”

Tie Niu and Zi Qing’s expressions drastically changed. They simultaneously took two steps forward to support Li Lingyi, their bodies glowing, exerting all their might to help him up.

Li Lingyi’s face turned crimson, white runes appeared all over his body, and the phantom figures of the scholars became even more solid. He tried to get up from the ground, but for some unknown reason, his knees seemed to be rooted to the ground; he simply couldn’t rise.

What was this bizarre ability? Wasn’t Zhou Tian supposed to be incapable of cultivation?

He could feel that the force making him kneel was an ineffable power, not Zhou Shu secretly helping Zhou Tian.

He could feel it, and the others in the VIP room could also feel it. All of them simultaneously rose to their feet.

The Great Generals of the Four Frontiers, the Imperial Advisor, the Prime Minister, the Carefree King, the Duke, and the leaders of several other major forces from other provinces. Overwhelming auras emanated from the VIP room. The entire competition venue seemed to transform into a desolate wilderness, a battlefield of gods and demons.

Ten-thousand-foot bone beasts like soul-reaping devils, bloodied fangs, demonic energy soaring to the sky, two divine swords piercing the firmament, heaven-observing divine eyes, flourishing scroll paintings evolving, a ten-thousand-foot Buddha with a benevolent face, a Daoist reclining on auspicious clouds, soul-reaping daggers hidden in endless light, dark mechas with three pairs of steel wings – these were the external manifestations of their wills!

The onlookers in the audience shivered. Why were so many important figures here today? Each aura was like a great sun hanging high in the sky, and several divine senses swept over, causing the void to tremble continuously. Zhou Shu, standing beside Zhou Tian, frowned and slightly raised his eyelids.

Several muffled groans came from the void. In the VIP room, those who had just unleashed their divine senses all spat out a mouthful of blood and retracted their divine senses. They had been too shocked just now and forgotten that an Imperial Realm existence was standing beside him!
