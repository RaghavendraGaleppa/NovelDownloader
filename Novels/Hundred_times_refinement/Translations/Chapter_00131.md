Chapter 81: Gathering

"Ribbit..."

The toad opened its mouth, spewing out a thick, dark green mist. Lin Xuan's expression changed, and he quickly stepped back, simultaneously taking out a talisman. As he circulated his spiritual energy, he flung the talisman forward, shouting, "Quick!"

The talisman burst into flames, and two large golden characters appeared in the air: "Po Xie" (Break Evil). The characters were imbued with strong spiritual energy, and their golden light illuminated the surrounding area, dispelling the mist.

Lin Xuan had used an auxiliary talisman, effective in countering poisonous beasts and ghostly entities. While it might not be useful against ordinary cultivators, it was potent against toxic creatures like the one before him.

With a flick of his sleeve, a brilliant light flashed, and the Golden Rope emerged, entwining the poisonous toad. Lin Xuan then spat out a small, dark green sword.

As soon as the battle began, Lin Xuan had unleashed two magical treasures. He preferred a swift resolution, as prolonged combat could attract unwanted attention. Although the toad's strength was equivalent to a cultivator at the peak of the Spirit Mobility stage, it should fall to his attacks.

However, the outcome differed from Lin Xuan's expectations. Despite its clumsy appearance, the toad was agile and dodged the Golden Rope's entanglement. It then spat out a black, shining bead, about the size of a fist, which clashed with Lin Xuan's flying sword.

"Devil's Core!" Lin Xuan exclaimed, his heart sinking. He controlled the Golden Rope, using his hand to guide it, and sent it chasing after the toad.

After several rounds, Lin Xuan still couldn't defeat the toad, and his expression grew increasingly grim. The commotion had become too great, and if he didn't resolve the battle quickly, other cultivators might arrive.

After a brief hesitation, Lin Xuan retrieved another talisman from his storage bracelet and released a beast wrapped in flames: the Ironclad Flame Tiger.

The Flame Tiger was a beast of the same rank as the poisonous toad. Lin Xuan had been reluctant to use it, as the beast's energy was depleted after two battles, but he had no choice but to deploy it to end the fight.

With the Flame Tiger's involvement, the tide of the battle shifted. The Golden Rope finally ensnared the toad, and the flying sword struck with deadly precision, beheading the beast.

Lin Xuan reclaimed his magical treasures and retrieved the Devil's Core, a black, ink-like object emitting a distinct spiritual energy. His face lit up with delight, as the Devil's Core was a valuable material for refining elixirs or crafting magical treasures.

Apart from the Devil's Core, the toad's corpse held little value. As Lin Xuan reached for the beast soul talisman, the Ironclad Flame Tiger let out a sorrowful cry, its body fading away until it disappeared.

Lin Xuan felt a pang of regret; the beast soul talisman's energy was exhausted. However, the value of the Devil's Core made up for the loss. After a moment's contemplation, Lin Xuan carefully harvested the thousand-year-old ginseng and stored it in his bag.

Without further delay, Lin Xuan left the area.

About a quarter of an hour later, several beams of light descended, and a group of Fire Spirit Gate disciples arrived at the scene of the toad's demise.

"A first-rate poisonous beast!" one of them exclaimed, their faces grave. The cultivator who had defeated such a beast must be formidable.

"We must inform Elder," another disciple said. "We can't let such a powerful cultivator remain in the Creek Valley; it would be disastrous."

Lin Xuan remained unaware that he had attracted the attention of the Fire Spirit Gate. Meanwhile, a fierce conflict erupted elsewhere in the Creek Valley.

Under the Fire Spirit Gate's elite's siege, the remaining cultivators, regardless of their affiliations, put aside their differences and cooperated to counter their common enemy.

As they fought and fled, the cultivators gradually gathered, totaling around twenty individuals, including two peak Foundation Establishment cultivators. Among them was Qin Yan, the renowned Cloud Fairy of the Drifting Cloud Valley.

Although the two great cultivator alliances were engaged in a消耗战 (war of attrition), the Creek Valley contained several unique spiritual herbs, drawing cultivators from both sides. Lin Xuan was not the only one who had infiltrated the valley.

Near a large boulder, two cultivators from the Dao Symbol Mountain sat, resting and recovering. Qin Yan, still serene and detached, radiated an aura of cold elegance, despite being wounded. Her once-snowy white robes were now stained with blood, and her exquisite face showed signs of fatigue.

Most of the gathered cultivators were in a similar state, having fought their way through the valley. The two peak Foundation Establishment cultivators became their temporary leaders, and they conferred, while the others rested and recovered their strength.
