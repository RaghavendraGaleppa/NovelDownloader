# Chapter 7: The Gourd Valley  

Several more hours passed, and the Flying Dragon Boat had reached the heart of the Great Cang Mountains. Huang Fei then instructed Liu Hao to land the vessel, and soon the group found themselves amidst a dense forest.  

Huang Fei immediately gathered the cultivators together. After sweeping his gaze over them, he announced, "Our target this time is the Gourd Valley. Once inside, you must gather as many spirit herbs as possible. You have one month."  

As soon as he finished speaking, murmurs broke out among the cultivators.  

"What? The Gourd Valley?"  
"Rumors say there are second-tier demonic beasts in there!"  
"Isn't this too dangerous?"  
"Brother Huang, our strength is simply not up to the task..."  

While the others voiced their concerns, Qin Chong merely frowned slightly and remained silent. At this point, was there any room for retreat?  

Just then, Huang Fei formed hand seals and muttered an incantation. Sensing something amiss, Qin Chong barely had time to react before a faint beam of light shot toward his forehead, striking him between the eyebrows.  

Though startled, Qin Chong felt no immediate discomfort. Yet he knew this was no benign spell.  

The others suffered the same fate—none had noticed the attack until it was too late. The group fell silent, their faces filled with dread as they stared at Huang Fei.  

"No need for alarm, fellow Daoists," Huang Fei said nonchalantly, as if the matter were trivial. "It's merely a minor Lightning Summoning Curse. As long as you emerge from the valley within a month, I will lift it for you. As for the details of this mission, let Liu Hao explain."  

Liu Hao then stepped forward. "Fellow Daoists, though the Gourd Valley carries some danger, this journey also presents a rare opportunity for great benefits. We only require a portion of the spirit herbs you collect—the rest will be yours to keep."  

At this, some hopeful expressions appeared among the group.  

"Now, let me specify the main herbs we seek: Dragon Vein Grass, Purple Bellflowers, Blazing Flame Fruit, and Dragon Blood Ginseng. For thirty-year-old specimens, we’ll pay five spirit stones per plant. For every additional ten years of age, we’ll add one spirit stone. Those aged sixty years or older will fetch ten spirit stones each, with an additional three stones for every extra decade. And if anyone finds century-old herbs, the starting price is one hundred spirit stones."  

Naturally, these prices were far below market value. However, herbs several decades old were already scarce, and century-old specimens were practically unheard of—likely already plundered by Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Still, there might be a few overlooked treasures—it all depended on luck.  

After some consideration, the cultivators reluctantly accepted the terms. Without the Flying Dragon Boat, they wouldn’t have been able to reach the Gourd Valley in the first place.  

Seeing no objections, Liu Hao smiled at Huang Fei before continuing, "Our primary objective is herb collection. Cooperate with each other inside the valley—no infighting. And don’t even think about hiding any herbs. The consequences of disobedience will be severe."  

The threat was blatant, yet the cultivators had no choice. The Gourd Valley had only one narrow entrance, surrounded by sheer cliffs hundreds of feet high. With their strength, escape was impossible.  

Even if someone managed to flee, the Great Cang Mountains were teeming with demonic beasts, making survival unlikely. Moreover, their storage pouches would undoubtedly be inspected upon exit.  

"Time is short. Enter the valley now," Huang Fei commanded.  

The cultivators hurried toward the valley entrance. Flying in such treacherous terrain would drain their spiritual energy and attract powerful beasts, so they had to proceed on foot.  

Watching them depart, Liu Hao smirked in satisfaction.  

"Senior Brother Huang, we should set off as well," he said.  

But Huang Fei shook his head. "Not yet. After they’ve all entered, we’ll set up the Five Elements Heavenly Barrier Formation at the entrance to prevent anyone from doubling back."  

"Senior Brother is truly thorough."  

"We’ve accepted multiple missions with tight deadlines. This is our only option."  

The three then worked swiftly at the valley entrance, soon erecting a gray barrier that spanned dozens of feet in all directions.  

Satisfied, Huang Fei nodded. "Let’s head to Eagle Ridge. We must complete our tasks within twenty days."  

The Flying Dragon Boat ascended once more, streaking across the sky toward the distance.  

Inside the Gourd Valley, Qin Chong gradually distanced himself from the others. The terrain had grown more open, and he deliberately slowed his pace.  

Though Liu Hao had spoken sweetly, listing over a dozen rare herbs essentially meant they were expected to gather everything of value in the valley.  

Over the years, Qin Chong had studied extensively, familiarizing himself with the geography and resource-rich areas within a thousand-mile radius.  

He suspected others in the group also knew the truth about the Gourd Valley, but none dared oppose the Canglong Valley cultivators.  

For Qin Chong, this expedition wasn’t entirely disadvantageous. While others couldn’t conceal herbs, he had a trick up his sleeve—his Bagua Space. Undetectable and spacious, it was the perfect tool for smuggling.  

If he could survive and leave the valley safely, he’d come out ahead.  

As for whether Huang Fei and his group would kill them all to seize the herbs—it seemed unlikely. Many of the cultivators came from established families. Though Qin Chong hadn’t sent word back, others surely had. With over a dozen participants, news of this venture had likely spread.  

If the trio dared commit mass murder, Canglong Valley would be the first to intervene.  

The cultivators cooperated precisely because they understood this. Otherwise, they would have rebelled long ago.  

Such was the plight of low-level cultivators—forced to risk their lives for meager gains. Though the lion’s share would go to the three leaders, any harvest was still a boon for rogue cultivators or minor clan disciples.  

The Gourd Valley stretched over a hundred miles, with its widest point spanning dozens of miles. Small peaks dotted the landscape, along with lakes and streams.  

Most Qi Refinement cultivators couldn’t fully abstain from food, but going a month without sustenance wasn’t a problem. Survival conditions here were manageable.  

The real threat was the demonic beasts. Though second-tier creatures lurked within, their numbers were few. With caution, escape was possible.
