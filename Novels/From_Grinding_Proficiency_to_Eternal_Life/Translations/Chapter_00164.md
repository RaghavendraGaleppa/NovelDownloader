# Chapter 164: The Literary Youth

Although he had cultivated for half an hour, it was still early in the morning.

The morning mist had condensed into frost particles on the treetops and had yet to disperse, with a chill still biting the air.

Xu Yunfan tightened the black iron buckle at his waist and fastened his black steel bracers. He strapped the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer to his back and was about to head down the mountain when his footsteps suddenly halted. He looked up sharply, his gaze fixed on a figure not far away on the ridge.

Thirty paces away, Su Zhenhe's moon-white arrow-sleeved robe was damp with dew, and the eight-sided sword at his waist, sheathed in sharkskin, emitted a faint green light.

What was more noteworthy was the woman beside him. She wore a plain gauze ruqun with a lotus-colored half-robe draped over it. A cloud-patterned sash cinched her waist, accentuating a figure as graceful as fresh bamboo after rain. A hint of the soft charm of the Jiangnan region shone through her brows. Her long, raven-black hair was not adorned with pearls or hairpins but was loosely tied up with a simple bamboo hairpin. The exposed nape of her neck was as smooth and flawless as white jade, completely unlike the muscular, sinewy figures of typical martial women.

In this world, where the Martial Path relies on blood and energy, one's physical build is a clear indicator of the thickness of their energy. For a woman to achieve fame in martial arts, she usually has to be more robust than the average man. The only alternative is to use secret medicines to contract her muscles, but that comes at the cost of her strength, which makes many unwilling to take that route.

Yan Yuwei was a prime example; once her muscles swelled, she became even more formidable than him.

As the mountain wind swept up her moon-white, shark-silk skirt, Xu Yunfan caught a glimpse of the hidden secrets beneath the seemingly thin fabric. The vine and lotus patterns embroidered on the cuffs with gold thread were actually made of hundred-refined steel wire, and the layered pleats of the skirt concealed the faint outlines of weapons.

Child's play.

As a disciple of the Heavenly Work Cave and having studied the martial arts knowledge of the four halls, becoming versed in the Heavenly Work Forging Technique, he had naturally developed a discerning eye.

"Brother Su, have your Flowing Firefly Thirteen Fans been taken to soak in Cold Spring Iron for maintenance? Why are you carrying a sword today?"

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over the long sword at the other's waist.

Three days ago during their spar, the fine steel folding fan clearly bore the unique coiling dragon patterns of the Xuanzhen Sect, but now it has been replaced by a sword with a hilt inlaid with the Seven Luminaries of the Northern Dipper.

He still vividly remembered the day the Old Taoist of Overlooking the Mountain allowed Su Zhenhe to use a sword.

Is he here today specifically to reclaim his honor?

Is this woman here to assist him?

Just as Xu Yunfan was speculating and his gaze turned wary, Su Zhenhe chuckled.

"Brother Xu has good eyesight."

Su Zhenhe's thumb brushed over the sword guard, and half an inch of the snowy blade suddenly shot out from its sheath, the air around it instantly freezing with a hint of frost.

The blade was densely covered with frost-like forging patterns, a sign of the Xuanzhen Sect's treasure, the "Jade Pot Ice."

"Three days ago, when Brother Xu's hammer shook Green Mountain, it actually convinced my master to loosen his restrictions. I can finally use a sword now."

Watching Xu Yunfan silently reach out and grip the long handle of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, Su Zhenhe's eyes flickered with excitement, but he ultimately shook his head and laughed. "Brother Xu, you've misunderstood. I am not here to fight you."

He stepped to the side and introduced, "This is the true disciple of the Miao Guang Peak of the Xuanzhen Sect, Yu Jingshan."

A true disciple of Miao Guang Peak was at least at the peak of the External Three Unions, and above that was the level of a master who had refined their muscles.

A figure like Yu Jingshan's was likely only achievable at the Muscle Refining Realm.

Yu Jingshan took a half-step forward, a smiling expression on her face.

"Brother Xu, the words you left behind that day were truly profound and righteous. When Junior Brother Su told me, I pondered them for many days and found them increasingly reasonable. That is why I asked Junior Brother Su to bring me here to meet you. If I am being a bother, please forgive me."

I get it. She's here to discuss poetry, walking the literary path.

Xu Yunfan replied, "Oh, that line wasn't written by me. It was said by a great sage from my hometown. I merely copied it. If I have caused you both to waste your efforts, I apologize."

"Brother Xu, could you perhaps introduce us?"

Yu Jingshan's eyes sparkled as she took another step forward.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the slightly embarrassed Su Zhenhe beside him and turned to answer, "That great sage has long since passed away. It is better not to disturb him."

Hearing this, Yu Jingshan's eyes dimmed slightly. Her expression, filled with a desire to have met him, made Xu Yunfan instantly label her.

A literary young woman.

And a hopeless, die-hard literary young woman at that.

After a pause, Xu Yunfan clasped his fists and said, "两位, I still have important matters to attend to. If you wish to go to the Heavenly Work City, you may come with me."

Su Zhenhe and Yu Jingshan agreed without hesitation, leaving Xu Yunfan with a wave of helplessness.

At noon, he was supposed to practice the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique with his master, Zhan Yan. Now that his External Three Unions were gradually reaching minor success and his three forces were merging, he could begin preliminary practice.

With these two in tow, he naturally wouldn't be able to practice his martial arts properly.

Although the Xuanzhen Sect is a top-tier sect and can be considered arrogant when facing other sects, the Heavenly Work Cave is different. Not to mention its exquisite forging techniques, the relationship between the Heavenly Work Cave Master, Hong Baichuan, and the Old Taoist of Overlapping Mountain, as well as the revealed Heavenly Work Fortress—which cannot be breached by any supreme Grandmaster of the Nine Realms of Qi Cultivation—naturally commands respect.

But since they are acquaintances, Xu Yunfan could only endure it with patience.

Along the way, Yu Jingshan asked curiously, "Brother Xu's name is quite marvelous. Why is it called 'Cloud Sail'?"

"Sometimes, through long winds and breaking waves, one will hoist a straight sail to cross the vast sea. It is taken from that line."

Xu Yunfan, who was contemplating how to slip away to practice later, casually replied.

"Good poem! A good poem!"

Yu Jingshan's eyes shone as she praised without hesitation. "In just two lines, it is deafening and thought-provoking. The spirit to create miracles in adversity, so free and easy, what a broad mind!"

Su Zhenhe beside him was even more excited. His hands kept searching his body, but when he realized he hadn't brought his folding fan this time, he had to give up.

"Brother Xu, what excellent literary talent. This line is so uplifting; I haven't seen such a thing in a long time."

Xu Yunfan was helpless. "This wasn't written by me either; otherwise, how would my name have come about?"

"...That's true. Brother Xu, could you perhaps introduce us?"

"That one has also long since passed away."

"What a pity, what a pity!"

As Su Zhenhe was full of regret, Yu Jingshan hurriedly asked, "Brother Xu, do you have any other poems? Please share them with us so we can feel the style of the sages."

"..."

Below the Heavenly Work City, the rumbling of the earth's veins shaking startled the entire forest of cold crows.

What greeted their eyes was a crowd of Heavenly Work Cave disciples, and the citizens of Heavenly Work City were busily preparing to bury the foundation of the机关城 (Mechanism City) underground.

On the city walls cast from black steel, thirty-six beast heads were spewing sulfur clouds. Each beast's mouth hung a ten-zhang long black iron chain, the ends of which were tied to the mechanism core areas half-buried in the earth. Hundreds of Disciples of the Melting Gold Hall were chiseling away at a giant abyssal mouth.

The disciples of the Melting Gold Hall had been working tirelessly day and night, digging underground tunnels, preparing to use Thunderfire Powder to blast a zhang deep below the Heavenly Work City.

It was a massive project. The Heavenly Work Cave had hired a large number of laborers from the surrounding ten miles, as well as from the nearest Shu Capital City.

The makeshift huts they had built stretched for nearly two li.
