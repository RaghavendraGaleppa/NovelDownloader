# Chapter 127: Calamity Fire Burns Bright, the Great Thousand Annihilated!

The Twelve Capitals Heaven Fiend Secret Demonic Calamity Light.

In this life, Lü Yang used the Blood Sun Sword Pellet as a vessel. Jade Suzhen, from the heavens, collected and refined the Heavenly Astral-Fiend Qi from beyond the sky, ultimately cultivating this great killing divine ability.

The moment the divine ability was activated, its vessel immediately shattered. The calamity light within would then blossom, drawing in Heavenly Astral Qi from beyond the thirty-six layers of Astral Clouds, transforming it into falling stars and meteors. When the calamity light descended from the sky, piercing through the thirty-six layers of Astral Clouds and gradually approaching the ground, it would then draw forth the Earth Fiend Qi from beneath the vast crust. This forced the fiend qi to surge, finally colliding, burning, and exploding with the Heavenly Astral Qi falling from the heavens, resulting in the death of all living beings within a five-thousand-li radius!

If it were merely at the Qi Condensation Great Perfection stage, it wouldn't achieve such power. However, Lü Yang activated this divine ability through the hand of the Maiden of Purity. With the authority and magical power of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, its might could be unleashed to its absolute maximum!

At this moment, the entire Boundary Heaven fell silent. Even the Spirit-Devouring Worms, which had been utterly frenzied, now ceased their movements, each one looking up in a daze at the calamity fire descending from the sky. This sight was like the heavens collapsing.

At the Dao Court's encampment, a disciple rushed over, his face filled with terror, practically stumbling and crawling as he yelled, "General! Outside, outside—"

Then he saw Wang Jinting's calm face. No, not calm. But numb. Because at this moment, Wang Jinting no longer knew what expression to make. Even just looking directly at the descending calamity fire made his eyes sting.

Escape using the [All-Encompassing Comprehensive Map]? Indeed, as a Karma-Fruit Treasure, the [All-Encompassing Comprehensive Map] could go anywhere within the Boundary Heaven, making it effortless to evade this calamity fire. However... it had its limits! The [All-Encompassing Comprehensive Map] could scan the entire Boundary Heaven and move freely, but that also required magical power support. Even if his magical power was exhausted, he could only move within a three-thousand-li radius. Yet, the aura of that calamity fire in the sky covered a full five thousand li! He couldn't escape at all!

"Hah, haha…" Wang Jinting opened his mouth, forcing out a few dry laughs. He glanced at Guangming, who was not far away, but he no longer even had the thought to question him. Immediately after, he looked at Yun Miaozhen beside him. Recalling the Miaozhen Immortal's previous assertiveness, Wang Jinting, with a one-in-ten-thousand glimmer of hope, slowly spoke: "Immortal, do you have a way to deal with it?"

Then he saw Yun Miaozhen look at him in a daze. Deal with this?

"Thump!"

The next second, Yun Miaozhen's delicate body went limp, and she directly collapsed onto the ground. Her beautiful eyes, which had been filled with rampant sword qi, now only held terror. Her Sword Heart had shattered. There was no imagined fight, no evenly matched clash. Simply witnessing the calamity fire descending from the sky, her Sword Heart shattered!

"This is impossible... It shouldn't be... Why...?"

Listening to Yun Miaozhen's murmuring, Wang Jinting was first stunned, then his gaze towards Yun Miaozhen changed, revealing an unspeakable pity.

"There is no 'why'," Wang Jinting said faintly. "We lost."

This was the outcome.

"...Lost?"

Only at this moment did Yun Miaozhen finally snap back to reality. However, the next second, intense fear appeared on her face after her Sword Heart shattered: "I am not a Dao Court disciple. This Dao-Contention War has nothing to do with me! I want to withdraw!"

What kind of joke was this? How could she die here? She was a true disciple of the Sword Pavilion! She was the future Foundation Establishment cultivator on whom the Yun family placed great hopes! As a cherished daughter of heaven, her potential was still far from being fully displayed!

Unwillingness, anger, fear, ambition – countless uncontrolled emotions surged forth from her shattered Sword Heart. Yet in the end, all emotions turned to dust. The calamity fire descended from the heavens. Within five thousand li, astral and fiend qi ground against each other, and the resulting super-heated explosions melted metal and stone. Endless fiend flames swallowed all living things.

Large numbers of Dao Court disciples stared blankly as their bodies ignited, disintegrated, and finally turned to dust. The last trace of light in their pupils was the searing white of the calamity fire's explosion. Not even the souls that drifted out after their physical bodies shattered were spared, likewise turning to ashes in the boiling astral-fiend qi.

In addition, there were the nearby Spirit-Devouring Worms. These unintelligent demonic creatures were indeed fierce. Even when facing the calamity fire, they bravely charged forward, then scattered into fragments in the air like moths to a flame.

— Calamity fire burns bright, the Great Thousand annihilated!

Everything from before life lost its meaning. Qi Condensation Mid-stage? Late-stage? Perfection? Great divine ability? The only difference was merely how long one could survive under the calamity fire.

At this moment, even Wang Jinting couldn't help but sigh deeply. In this Dao-Contention War, the Dao Court and Pure Land had collaborated and were quite prepared. They had originally thought they could take advantage of the Primal Saint Sect's lack of capable successors to make a huge profit. Who could have imagined this outcome? They had already won, yet the Primal Saint Sect actually produced a Foundation Establishment True Person! You're already Foundation Establishment, is it fun to bully Qi Condensation cultivators?

"Beasts, ah…" Looking at Yun Miaozhen, who had already turned to ashes, Wang Jinting let out one last furious, unwilling curse, then vanished into the light just like that—

At the same time, the Saint Sect's side also witnessed this scene. After the searing white radiance, there was a gigantic mushroom cloud, flowing with scarlet fire and golden lightning, rising slowly, along with an impact storm that swept in all directions. Even from their location, they could faintly feel the ripples of wind brushing their faces.

"I'll be damned…" On the battlefield, Xu Xin lay beside the exhausted Chongming, patting Chongming's body: "Young Master, are you dead? If not, come out and see the True Person."

"I'll kill your mom... Get off me." Chongming's body twitched slightly, letting out a low growl of anger. It wanted to roll over, but was truly out of strength, and could only let Xu Xin lie on him.

On the other side, Daoist Flood Dragon also lay coiled on the ground. His body was the largest, and he had sustained the most injuries. Fortunately, his vitality was also the most tenacious, so he was still alive, merely silently looking downwards. Lying there was Bi Feiyuan. Her once beautiful body had been gnawed beyond recognition. One of her previously lustrous eyes had been eaten, leaving only a dark, empty socket.

"...She's dead." Looking at Qin Tianhe approaching, Daoist Flood Dragon said dully: "Her divine ability had too many limitations. After all, bugs don't care if she's pretty or not."

"Hearing you say that, do you think I'm very pretty?" Suddenly, Bi Feiyuan laboriously lifted her head, turned her blood-stained pretty face, and with her only remaining intact beautiful eye, winked flirtatiously at Daoist Flood Dragon.

Daoist Flood Dragon: "..."

On the other side, Qin Tianhe also smiled: "It seems our luck isn't bad. With the True Person's intervention, this Dao-Contention War is ultimately ours to win!"

Hearing this, Bi Feiyuan glanced at the completely unharmed Qin Tianhe, and her lips twitched slightly: "Lazy winner."

As soon as she said this, Qin Tianhe's smile immediately froze on his face. He couldn't help but say, "I'm the one who found the Dao Court's location! My contribution was significant! Only looking at the outcome distorts one's efforts!"

"What does that have to do with you? Wasn't it because that bald donkey surrendered? Oh right, where's that bald donkey? What's his name? He didn't die, did he?"

"Oh, I forgot about him."

"He was also within the calamity fire's range, so he was probably killed by mistake."

"Then that's his bad luck."

Just then, a somewhat awkward, timid voice suddenly came from nearby: "Esteemed cultivators... This humble monk is still alive."

Everyone turned back in surprise, only then seeing Guangming, who was shrinking his neck and carefully hiding in a corner. He actually escaped the calamity fire's attack range?

"I didn't go in the first place..." Facing the watchful, curious gazes that seemed ready to dissect him, Guangming quickly explained: "The one who went was this humble monk's clone..."

While explaining, Guangming didn't forget to curse furiously in his heart. He knew that these devils from the Primal Saint Sect had no moral principles, so he had prepared a contingency beforehand when dealing with these beasts. Even surrendering required an extra layer of caution, otherwise, he might just be used as 'talent' and consumed!
