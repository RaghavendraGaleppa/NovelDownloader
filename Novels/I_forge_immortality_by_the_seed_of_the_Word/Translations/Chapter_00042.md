# Chapter 42: Peace in Black Mountain  

The spirit crane gradually descended in altitude.  

Bit by bit, an ancient city came into clear view. It was evening. Wisps of cooking smoke rose from the city, its streets bustling with people, lively and vibrant. Vendors on both sides gestured exaggeratedly, seemingly doing their utmost to catch the attention of passersby.  

Zhang Jing's gaze shifted away from the crowd and swept over the surroundings.  

Outside the city walls, the roads were crisscrossed with ravines, the soil tinged with a faint reddish hue. The walls themselves were cracked and fissured, with many collapsed houses nearby, overgrown with wild grass.  

Desolate! Dilapidated! Lifeless!  

A stark contrast to the lively scene at the city center.  

"Junior Brother, those are the remnants of past battles between the disciples of our Dao Academy and the countless demons of Langya County," Senior Brother Ding explained in a low voice, noticing Zhang Jing's gaze.  

Then, raising his voice, he called out to the other three, "Come over here for a moment. I need to reiterate the details of this mission."  

"Yes, Senior Brother!" they replied in unison, steering their spirit cranes toward him.  

"This mission rewards seventy-five Dao merits. I suggest we split them equally this time. As for demon corpses and other materials, we'll handle them as usual," Senior Brother Ding said, glancing at Zhang Jing before addressing the group.  

"No problem!"  

The three, including Senior Sister Tong, exchanged knowing smiles as they looked at Zhang Jing and responded in unison.  

"Since there are no objections, I'll outline the specifics of this mission," Senior Brother Ding cleared his throat and continued, "According to the mission directive, we'll start from Black Mountain County in Langya, sweeping eastward to cleanse the demons along the way across nine counties, before finally arriving at Langya's main city to regroup with our senior brothers."  

"Be warned! Though these areas have already been cleared by our seniors, that doesn’t mean we can afford to be careless. Especially you, Junior Brother Zhang—this is your first mission and likely your first encounter with demons. You must be extremely cautious. Never underestimate them."  

"Demons are far more vicious, cruel, and cunning than you can imagine!"  

"Yes, Senior Brother!"  

"Understood, Senior Brother!"  

"Thank you for the warning, Senior Brother. I’ll keep it in mind."  

The group responded one after another, their vigilance heightened.  

Meanwhile, in the Black Mountain County government office below...  

Inside a lavishly decorated hall, four men sat around a square table, chatting and laughing as they drank. Rare delicacies, usually hard to come by, were brought out one after another by serving girls as if they cost nothing.  

A stern-faced county magistrate, dressed in official robes, sat below the others, holding a wine jug as he poured for the men at the table.  

"Gentlemen, this humble county is deeply grateful for your tireless protection of Black Mountain. Thanks to your efforts, our people have been able to maintain peace in the midst of Langya’s demonic turmoil. We truly don’t know how to express our gratitude," he said obsequiously. "All we can offer is this modest wine as a token of appreciation. I hope you won’t take offense."  

Seated above the magistrate were three men in gray robes.  

One had a black mole the size of a coin on his face, making him stand out. Another was elderly with a hoarse voice, while the third was tall and burly, his expression simple and honest.  

Hearing the magistrate’s words, the man with the mole downed his wine and laughed heartily.  

"Hahaha! When the world is in peril and demons run rampant, it's our duty as cultivators to step forward and protect the people. My brothers and I have merely done our small part. There’s no need for such praise, Magistrate."  

"Exactly what our elder brother said!"  

"Magistrate, you’re too kind. This hospitality is more than enough for us."  

Relieved, the magistrate chuckled and clapped his hands.  

A group of constables led more than a dozen young women into the hall. The three men at the table stared, their eyes widening.  

Noticing their reaction, the magistrate gave an imperceptible nod before saying carefully,  

"These women, though mere mortals, are deeply grateful for your protection of Black Mountain. They volunteered to serve and care for you, hoping to express the sincerity of our people."  

"Would you gentlemen consider giving them this opportunity?"  

The elderly man among the three hesitated before sighing. "Ah, well... Since it’s the people’s goodwill, refusing might hurt their feelings. Magistrate, have them sent to our quarters to wait."  

Just then, a middle-aged man dressed as an advisor hurried into the hall. He leaned in to whisper to the magistrate but was immediately interrupted.  

"Advisor, with our esteemed guests present, such behavior is impolite. Speak openly."  

"Magistrate, five Daoist priests in blue robes have arrived at the government office. They claim to be disciples of the Dao Academy."  

What?!  

The magistrate’s pupils contracted. He quickly stood and bowed to the three men. "Gentlemen, please excuse me. I must greet these Dao Academy disciples. I beg your understanding."  

The man with the mole also rose to his feet, his expression calm.  

"Of course. We’ll accompany you, Magistrate. It’s a rare chance to witness the famed disciples of the Dao Academy."  

Before long, led by the magistrate, the four of them made their way to the front hall of the government office.  

Elsewhere...  

"Senior Brother, why are we heading straight to the government office this time?" Tong Yao asked, puzzled.  

Senior Brother Ding shook his head with a smile.  

"This time is different. Didn’t you notice? Black Mountain County seems unusually peaceful, with no signs of demonic activity."  

"But the Dao Academy’s mission wouldn’t be wrong. It’s said the Surveillance Pavilion possesses a divine mirror that monitors all directions. The Demon-Suppressing Missions from the Spiritual Dao Pavilion are determined based on its observations. So there must be demons here."  

"By visiting the government office first, we can gather information on any anomalies and narrow our search."  

As they spoke, hurried footsteps approached.  

Moments later, the nervous figure of the magistrate appeared before them. He bowed deeply.  

"Magistrate Shen He greets the five esteemed immortals! My apologies for not welcoming you sooner!"  

"Magistrate Shen, has anything unusual happened in Black Mountain County recently?" Senior Brother Ding asked directly.  

The magistrate looked up, his expression puzzled.  

"Where did you hear such news, Immortal?"  

"To my knowledge, Black Mountain has been peaceful lately. Nothing out of the ordinary has occurred."  

"Truly?"  

"I wouldn’t dare lie to you, Immortal. Thanks to the efforts of several other immortals, all demonic activity in Black Mountain has ceased."  

"Other immortals?"  

Senior Brother Ding’s gaze swept over the rogue cultivators standing outside before returning to the magistrate.  

"In that case, we’ll take our leave."
