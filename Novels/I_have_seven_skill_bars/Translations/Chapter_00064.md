# Chapter 64: Heavy Essence Poison and Vein-Clearing Flower

The Long-tailed Wolf King, however, nodded at this moment: "This is indeed a method. With other cultivators cooperating, and us providing information, we can completely use this reason to minimize our losses."

Among the Wolf Cultivators, the minority usually obeyed the majority.

Upon hearing this, the Fire Scar Wolf King could only nod, albeit reluctantly: "Alright, but we must only do this after this plan has truly failed. It's still early, and I have full confidence in my poison!"

The Fire Scar Wolf King grinned ferociously. The scars on its face were from being burned while concocting poisons, a testament to its obsession with poison and its profound mastery in this field!

...

The Wolf Cultivators' poison indeed brought immense trouble to the Sect Domain.

Cultivators were originally quite resistant to poison. Potent True Essence could provide protection, allowing them to quickly dispel and expel toxins even upon contact.

However, this poison of the Wolf Cultivators, while it couldn't directly suppress a cultivator's True Essence and physical capabilities to achieve a lethal effect, would directly fuse with a cultivator's True Essence and slow down its circulation speed. It was named "Heavy Essence Poison" by the cultivators of the Sect Domain.

After the first night when some inner disciples were poisoned, the Wolf Cultivators seized the opportunity to strike again the next day, administering more poison. Having confirmed the effectiveness of their poison, the Wolf Cultivators grew even more brazen, launching relentless attacks and wantonly deploying their toxins. This caused many core combatants in the Sect Domain to lose their fighting capability, with not a few even dying on the battlefield.

Ultimately, only the Sect Elders at the Core Formation stage could step forward to confront the Wolf Cultivators.

This was undoubtedly the worst news for the Sect Domain. For any power to stand tall, the only reason was the number and cultivation level of its peak cultivators. If the Sect Domain had lacked peak cultivators at the Core Formation stage from the beginning, it would likely have been long since enslaved by some powerful demonic cultivators and used as cultivation resources.

However, peak cultivators were not absolutely deterrent. They also needed to constantly cultivate, using vast resources and time to grow stronger, only then could they better protect the entire faction. Every peak cultivator strove to make themselves stronger. If some cultivated slower, allowing their opponents or other cultivators to achieve massive breakthroughs and open a significant gap, those peak cultivators who failed to keep pace would inevitably pay a heavy price.

However, the effects of this Vein-Clearing Flower were temporary and short-lived. Furthermore, it offered little help in cultivation or combat, as it could only accelerate the circulation speed of True Essence but couldn't eliminate the meridians' inherent resistance. In combat, a faster True Essence circulation speed wasn't necessarily always better; it needed to be at the speed the cultivator was most accustomed to. Thus, no cultivator had ever researched where the Vein-Clearing Flower could be effectively used, leading it to be largely ignored until now. They could only begin researching it from this point.

...

The cultivators of the Sect Domain developed the Vein-Clearing Pill using the Vein-Clearing Flower, instantly turning the tide of the battlefield. The Wolf Cultivators were caught off guard immediately and suffered heavy losses. However, the Wolf Cultivators' Heavy Essence Poison offensive was clearly well-prepared. They continuously had poisons to use at will, with no signs of running out, clearly possessing vast reserves and the ability to incessantly produce and refine them.
