## Chapter 121: Clearing the Field

The giant pit was shrouded in misty light, its edges stained with blood. The atmosphere at the scene was exceptionally tense. No one had anticipated such successive twists and turns at the very last moment. All factions were displeased; some were furious, some were brimming with killing intent, some sighed in regret, some were distraught, and others were on the verge of madness.

Li Qingxu's eyes were bloodshot. His hand was already outstretched, just a hair's breadth away from snatching the Eight Trigram Furnace and fleeing, becoming the ultimate winner. "Who?!" He wanted to kill someone. Three times, he had been just that close. If he could have touched it just once, the contest would have ended immediately. He knew there wouldn't be a fourth chance. The feeling of watching a near-immortal item fly away, missing it by a hair, would make anyone else's mental state collapse. Purple aura erupted from his entire body. He swung the purple bamboo staff in his hand, shattering a four-meter-high bluestone.

At this moment, Tang Xumi's face was even more filled with killing intent. His own subordinate had betrayed him, suddenly striking him with a palm and seizing the Eight Trigram Furnace. This was like being kicked down from the clouds of glory, the drop was too great, and he felt deeply humiliated. Fortunately, that near-immortal item actually flew back towards him! The enraged Tang Xumi was stunned, then delighted. What kind of absurd thing was this? It was truly outrageous!

After changing its trajectory, the Eight Trigram Furnace had fallen into the hands of an elite disciple. He was instantly bewildered, feeling no joy, only fright. In the current volatile atmosphere, where a single hot breath could ignite the tension, this was a "death-seeking item." Holding it for even one more breath could mean losing his head, getting it blasted into a pulp. Thankfully, he reacted quickly and threw it away immediately.

Although Li Qingyue appeared, not many people noticed her, as she was currently a golden-armored guard wearing a golden mask.

It must be said, Lu Zhen, the young man from the Yin-Yang Temple, was truly formidable. He had already retreated but now returned, his hands emitting black and white light, once again rushing to seize the Eight Trigram Furnace. In front of Lu Zhen, both golden-armored guards and outer-realm disciples were overturned by him. His Yin-Yang energy exploded, and two streaks of heavenly light, one black and one white, flew from his hands, proving unstoppable. Moreover, his Yin-Yang black-and-white light possessed a profound characteristic: not only could it kill, but it could also snatch away various spiritual items. Not far away, someone, with all their might, hurled a spiritual spear forged from lightning-struck wood towards him. It whistled through the air, only to be instantly swept to the ground and shredded by the black-and-white light.

"You dare to come again!" Tang Xumi roared furiously. He had already reached out and grabbed the near-immortal item, his killing intent surging, his conscious spiritual light boiling.

In an instant, Lu Zhen and Tang Xumi clashed. The properties of the Yin-Yang light completely changed; the black light vanished, transforming into pure extreme Yang, burning fiercely like the sun's fire. The outer-realm disciples who had been knocked over, upon rising, were immediately forced back again, daring not to approach. They retracted their conscious spiritual light, fearing being ignited and burned through. Even powerful individuals like Tang Xumi, facing this special energy technique, the world-renowned Extreme Yang Light, could only immediately retract his conscious spiritual light and urge the divine aura from his Huangting to surge forward. A dazzling light erupted between them, sending all table-sized rocks on the ground flying. Many were even torn apart in mid-air, scattering shattered stone everywhere. Many outer-realm disciples were shaken. This young man from the Yin-Yang Temple was truly terrifying. A peer who walked the path of mutation could actually clash head-on with a core disciple of the outer realm!

Although Tang Xumi was injured, he still possessed extraordinary combat power, blocking Lu Zhen and conjuring a spiritual blade tempered by heavenly light, slashing forward through the air!

Suddenly, the ground cracked, and an ethereal figure approached. Li Qingxu, realizing how fierce the young man his family invited was, dared to make a second move. He naturally followed suit, hoping for a fourth chance to touch the Eight Trigram Furnace. He knew that his family had sent many rare treasures to the Yin-Yang Temple's sect to invite this young man to act, and it truly was "worth the price."

Li Qingxu struck the brilliant spiritual blade with his staff, blocking Tang Xumi's fierce attack. Lu Zhen, living up to expectations, channeled his Yin-Yang energy, and black-and-white light erupted. He had already broken through, engaging in close combat with Tang Xumi. With a boom, like a bolt of lightning, the two exchanged a palm strike, both losing their footing and retreating backward. "You're walking two paths simultaneously, also cultivating a special Heavenly Light energy?" The young man from the Yin-Yang Temple was truly surprised.

Upon hearing this, the outer-realm disciples were momentarily lost in thought, sighing that Tang Xumi was indeed impressive, possessing such hidden power, walking two paths. "He's just using it to temper his conscious spiritual light, not to advance on two paths simultaneously," Li Qingxu said, swinging his bamboo staff to attack again.

The three engaged in a fierce battle, divine aura like waves crashing in all directions, smoke and dust rolling, the ground riddled with half-foot-wide cracks.

A ghost-like figure appeared. Jiang Shengyu, who had already withdrawn from the battlefield, surged back in, attacking directly, hoping to seize the Eight Trigram Furnace amidst the chaos. Su Jingzhu also rushed over. Hu Tingwen gritted his teeth, drank a vial of medicinal liquid, and also found an opportune moment to enter the fray and contend for the near-immortal item.

In an instant, a massive melee erupted here!

Tang Xumi coughed blood, throwing the Eight Trigram Furnace to the ground. If he kept holding it, he would surely be surrounded and killed. Lu Zhen was wounded, blood continuously flowing from his mouth. This was because the newly joined core disciples specifically targeted him. Everyone was injured; it was impossible for the young man from the Yin-Yang Temple to remain in full peak condition alone.

At this moment, people saw a female golden-armored guard slowly approaching the battlefield. Although her entire body was covered in cold metal plates, people could still feel that she possessed a touch of immortal grace; she was definitely not an outsider. Her body was already flowing with brilliant light rain. As she stepped lightly towards the battlefield, the core disciples engaged in the melee surprisingly all attacked her alone, employing their strongest techniques. "What's happening?" Everyone outside the field was shocked.

Earlier, there had been a case of six core disciples jointly ambushing an elite disciple. Now, it was even more absurd: all core disciples, even including the injured Yin-Yang Temple youth, charged at a single mysterious woman.

With a thud, Jiang Shengyu flew backward, blood pouring from his nose and mouth, even his ears were bleeding. He was directly sent back over twenty meters. Hu Tingwen was swept by a five-colored divine mist, his body staggering, almost falling to the ground, also constantly retreating backward. With a clang, a short sword enveloped in divine aura appeared in Li Qingyue's hand. It collided with Li Qingxu's purple bamboo staff, parrying the staff. The sword's edge then emitted brilliant light, drawing blood on Li Qingxu's chest and forcing him to quickly retreat. Li Qingyue held a small, slightly larger-than-palm-sized wooden shield in her left hand, emitting a crystalline luster. It collided with the Yin-Yang Temple youth's right palm, sending sand and stones flying nearby like a hurricane, and even many huge rocks were torn apart. With bangs and thuds, Tang Xumi and Su Jingzhu also flew backward, their faces pale, bodies stained with blood. After falling to the ground, their bodies swayed incessantly.

This turn of events left the watching disciples dumbfounded. Who had entered the scene? So powerful!

Li Qingyue spoke: "I know you've been waiting for me to approach, wanting to try another group hunt, to attack me en masse. Was the act very tiring?" She knew very well that when she threw the stone, although most people didn't notice, it was impossible to hide from everyone; a few individuals had discovered her. "Actually, I could have just watched the winds gather and entered the field later, giving you no chance at all." After saying this, Li Qingyue looked at everyone and said, "In that case, you might not have been convinced afterward. I'm giving you a chance now. You are all injured, aren't you? Then come at me together, and those who haven't made a move secretly can also enter the fray!"

Everyone's hearts pounded. She was going to clear the field! The watching disciples knew who had arrived: Li Qingyue, the most favored candidate for the near-immortal item in this competition, had reappeared! "Isn't Junior Sister Li supposed to be heavily injured from being ambushed? She's actually unharmed!" "This... truly beyond my expectations!"

Li Qingyue removed her golden mask, revealing her true face. Like an immortal maiden donned in armor, amidst her serene and ethereal aura, a powerful presence began to rise.

Those outside the field were shocked, then a clamor erupted. Inside the field, the core disciples' faces were grim. Their current state was very poor. Even joining forces like this, they probably couldn't suppress Li Qingyue. This was because they clearly felt that Li Qingyue had become stronger, seemingly reaching another level.

Tang Xumi gave a wry smile, saying, "Junior Sister Li, you really didn't need to appear so early. We ambushed you before, so no matter how you entered the field in the end, no one would have been unconvinced. It seems this is fate. We were wary of you and wanted to eliminate you first, but after all this roundabout, you're the one clearing the field in the end, returning to the center stage."

Li Qingyue said, "I'm giving everyone an explanation. This is everyone's final battle, so feel free to give it your all!"

Li Qingxu's expression changed slightly, and the other core disciples also had complex looks, guessing that Li Qingyue's final return battle was likely to establish her prestige and win over other disciples' hearts, preparing for the future.

"This is a competition for outer-realm disciples. You should leave, otherwise, I'll focus on you first," Li Qingyue said, looking at Lu Zhen. The young man from the Yin-Yang Temple was very strong, but he had angered Tang Xumi, dragging him into a head-on clash, and others were wary of him, so they naturally struck secretly. He was now seriously injured. "I did my best," Lu Zhen nodded to Li Qingxu, then turned and left without any hesitation.

The next moment, all core disciples attacked again. They were truly unwilling to give up until the very last moment. Even if many of them were injured, if they endured the pain and unleashed a few ultimate techniques, could they not break through Li Qingyue's protective aura?

A chaotic battle erupted!

Just then, a tall figure, like a flash of lightning, entered the field. Her speed was incredibly fast. Holding a spiritual spear, she stabbed towards Li Qingyue's back. With a clang, Li Qingyue seemed to have anticipated it, and the crystalline small wooden shield blocked the spiritual spear. At the same time, she suddenly turned around and clashed palms with the newcomer. Endless divine aura erupted, and a colorful storm seemed to appear here, sweeping in all directions. The newly entered figure retreated continuously, her fair hand spasming, her conscious spiritual light fluctuating and dimming. She continuously coughed blood.

"Qingyue, you haven't just made a small breakthrough, but a huge one!" Wang Caiwei sighed. After watching for so long, hiding her strength until the very end to enter the field, she still couldn't win. It changed nothing!

This scene shocked the other core disciples. Although reinforcements had arrived, they weren't happy at all. Hidden opponents kept appearing one after another; how could anyone feel at ease? Wang Caiwei attacked again. Her strength was extremely formidable. She exchanged several blows with Li Qingyue, her beautiful face turning deathly pale, blood fading from it. The others also joined the siege. The near-immortal item was right before their eyes; they were truly unwilling to give up.

Bang, bang, bang... Several core disciples were heavily wounded in succession! The Eight Trigram Furnace flew out during the battle, but none of the other outer-realm disciples dared to pick it up. Many knew that it practically already belonged to Li Qingyue.

Qin Ming climbed up the giant pit and happened to see the near-immortal item land on the edge. Fearing it would fall, he picked it up.

"Give it to me!" Wang Caiwei left the battlefield, bloodied, and rushed towards him, brilliant flowing light appearing under her feet as she moved swiftly.

Li Qingyue glanced at her but did not pursue.
