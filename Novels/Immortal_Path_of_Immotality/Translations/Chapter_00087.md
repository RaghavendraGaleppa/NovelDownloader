# Chapter 87: An Unexpected Reunion  

That night, the entire capital of the Great Song Dynasty was stirred.  

At first, the two streaks of light in the sky had only caught the attention of cultivators. But the dozens of crisp clashing sounds that followed reverberated through the air, waking everyone in the city.  

Countless people rose from their beds and opened their windows, gazing at the two fading trails of light in the night sky, unsure of what had happened.  

On this sleepless night for many, Lin Shan stood in the streets, facing a life-or-death decision—how to turn the tables and escape.  

The golden streak of light in the sky came to a steady halt, hovering mid-air. The royal family’s Foundation Establishment elder sneered coldly as he looked down at the small green figure below. Just as he was about to strike again, he suddenly noticed the defensive artifact Lin Shan had summoned. It looked vaguely familiar...  

Upon closer inspection, fragments of memories from over a hundred years ago flashed through his mind, and he couldn’t help but exclaim, "The Cloud Copper Heart Mirror!"  

"What is your relationship with Elder Zuo?"  

Lin Shan was startled by the elder’s outburst. Did this royal Foundation Establishment elder recognize this artifact?  

Then it hit him—of course! When Elder Zuo had given him this artifact, even the appraiser, Elder Zhang, had recognized it at a glance. It was apparently one of Elder Zuo’s signature artifacts from before he reached the Golden Core stage.  

Among the older generation who frequented Yichuan Market, it seemed to be common knowledge.  

Realizing this, Lin Shan saw an opportunity. Perhaps he could use this connection to his advantage.  

Meanwhile, scattered groups of rogue cultivators had gathered on rooftops in the distance, watching the scene unfold. They were curious about who had been foolish enough to provoke a royal Foundation Establishment elder and were also hoping to curry favor with the royal family after the fight ended.  

After all, many of them served as retainers for various noble houses or factions in the capital. Building good relations with the royal family was always beneficial. A quick count revealed at least thirty to forty cultivators present.  

Lin Shan’s mind raced. He immediately responded, amplifying his voice with spiritual energy so that it echoed through the silent night, reaching nearly half the capital.  

"I am Lin Shan, disciple of Elder Zuo, Golden Core elder of Yichuan’s Internal Affairs Hall! Greetings to the royal Foundation Establishment senior!"  

His booming voice reverberated under the night sky.  

Countless mortals in the capital were puzzled. What was Yichuan? Who was Elder Zuo? What did "royal Foundation Establishment" mean?  

But the leaders of major factions and nobility, though unaware of the full details, had at least heard of the Yichuan Market. Their hearts pounded with shock.  

The rogue cultivators watching from afar were even more stunned. A disciple of Elder Zuo, a Golden Core elder from Yichuan’s Internal Affairs Hall? The person the royal elder was hunting had such a background?  

The royal Foundation Establishment elder in the sky was equally dumbfounded. He had suspected Lin Shan might have some connection to Elder Zuo after seeing the Cloud Copper Heart Mirror, but why did he have to shout it so loudly for the whole city to hear?  

As for why Lin Shan had done so, everyone present understood perfectly.  

Before Lin Shan revealed his identity, the royal elder could have killed him without consequence—no one would have known who he was.  

But now that everyone knew, killing him would require careful consideration of the repercussions. No one could guarantee that some opportunistic rogue cultivator wouldn’t report the incident to Elder Zuo.  

If the Golden Core elder were to become enraged, even a royal Foundation Establishment cultivator wouldn’t escape punishment.  

After all, the Great Song royal family was merely a puppet regime. As long as the bloodline continued, no major sect would go out of their way to protect a single royal cultivator against a Golden Core elder.  

The atmosphere grew increasingly tense, as if a storm were brewing over the capital. The rogue cultivators watching from the sidelines trembled, cursing themselves for getting involved.  

Who knew what this guy had done to provoke the royal elder? If the elder insisted on killing him, would they—the witnesses—also be silenced to keep the secret?  

Lin Shan stared intently at the sky. If the elder attacked, he would immediately execute his plan—strengthening talismans or artifacts, fighting with everything he had.  

He would never surrender without a fight.  

The royal elder, standing atop his golden flying sword, was caught in a dilemma, his expression shifting between anger and hesitation.  

Truthfully, the death of the Great Yan princess he had purchased at an exorbitant price wasn’t an irreparable loss.  

But now, the entire capital was watching.  

If Elder Zuo himself were standing before him, backing down would be expected—no one would question it.  

But this was just a measly Qi Condensation brat. If he let Lin Shan flaunt his identity and walk away unscathed after a public chase, the royal family’s dignity would be shattered.  

He wasn’t entirely convinced of Lin Shan’s claim, but the Cloud Copper Heart Mirror was undeniable proof. Even if Lin Shan wasn’t Elder Zuo’s direct disciple, he was undoubtedly connected to him in some significant way.  

The scene was eerily silent, everyone waiting for the royal elder’s decision.  

Kill, or spare?  

The rogue cultivators were already preparing to flee. If the elder chose to attack, they’d have to scatter—survival was the priority.  

All they could hope was that Lin Shan’s transgression wasn’t severe enough to warrant extreme measures.  

Lin Shan, however, smirked inwardly. The real trouble he’d caused was something the elder hadn’t even realized yet. Once the Crown Prince’s son—the middle-aged man in brocade robes—died, that eerie giant eye would emerge, and then...  

Just as the tension reached its peak, a surge of energy erupted from deep within the royal palace. A streak of purple light soared into the sky, leisurely making its way to the center of the confrontation under the watchful eyes of the crowd.  

The light halted, revealing two figures standing on a violet thundercloud.  

At the front was a middle-aged man in purple robes, his hair tied in a topknot with a jade belt around his waist, exuding the aura of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Behind him stood a young man in white robes, though only at the late Qi Condensation stage.  

The rogue cultivators collectively sighed in relief at the sight of the purple-robed man. With him here, the royal elder wouldn’t dare silence all witnesses.  

The newcomer was none other than Thundercloud Master, a direct disciple of the Violet Sky Sect—one of the Great Song’s three major cultivation sects—stationed in the palace as their representative. Even if the royal elder had the audacity to try silencing everyone, he might not even be a match for Thundercloud Master in a fight.  

The Great Song had many cultivation sects, but only three stood at the pinnacle, each with their own profound legacies, dozens of branches, and cultivators ranging from Foundation Establishment to Golden Core. Rumor had it they even had Nascent Soul True Monarchs, beings so lofty they were rarely seen.  

The Great Song’s royal family was merely a puppet regime propped up by these sects—a watchdog, at best. Offending the three major sects would bring nothing but disaster.  

Seeing Thundercloud Master, the royal elder had no choice but to clasp his hands in greeting. "Fellow Daoist Thundercloud."  

Thundercloud Master gave a casual nod, his demeanor slightly condescending. He glanced around and asked lazily,  

"What’s the matter, Fellow Daoist? Why such a commotion?"  

The royal elder noticed Thundercloud Master’s lack of courtesy and arrogant attitude, but years of experience had dulled his pride. He forced a smile and replied, "It’s nothing major. Just a junior who killed someone I purchased from the Yichuan auction—"  

Before he could finish, the white-robed youth behind Thundercloud Master suddenly interrupted. After scrutinizing Lin Shan from above, he asked uncertainly,  

"Lin Shan?"  

Hearing the voice, Lin Shan turned his gaze toward the speaker. The young man in white robes looked somewhat familiar—reminiscent of an old acquaintance from the Lin family in Qinghe County, someone who had once taken the fall for him.  

"Lin... Lin Fan?"
