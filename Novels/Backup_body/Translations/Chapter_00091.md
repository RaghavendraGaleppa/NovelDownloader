# Chapter 91: Was the Wall-Climbing Bird Captured for Sacrificial Rites?

In recent days, the matter of the Debt Collector had shaken the upper echelons of various factions.

A Supreme Elder of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect had fallen, the Array Pavilion Master had perished, the Guardian Divine Bird of the mountain was on the brink of death and had vanished without a trace. Moreover, the true identity of the Ancient Moon Peak's Chief had been exposed.

This single major event had cost the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect four Human Immortals!

The Luofu Immortal Sect had suffered even greater losses, with even their Sect Leader perishing, resulting in heavy casualties among their upper ranks. The sect now teetered on the brink of collapse!

However, as these matters involved the Debt Collector, they were considered secrets of the immortal sects. Only the Human Immortals of the top factions and their designated successors—whether Daoist heirs or Buddhist heirs—were privy to this information.

For ordinary sects, family clans, and rogue cultivators in the world, the most shocking news came from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's Spirit Mine Mountain.

**Li Zhengjing**, age seventeen, at the True Qi realm.

**Status**: Traitor of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.

Originally a Golden-Edged Silver Token disciple of the Ancient Moon Peak, he was expelled for stealing from the Spirit Mine Mountain and fleeing the sect.

**Notable Achievements**:

- Shortly after reaching the Inner Qi realm, he slew an upper-level Inner Qi demonic cultivator in Wanlin County.
- A month later, he executed the Venom King Xin Xuan, salvaging the reputation of Central Province.
- Another month later, at the Spirit Mine Mountain, he killed three True Qi realm Inner Sect Elders, severely injured another elder and a True Disciple, and slaughtered thirty-six Inner Sect disciples.
- A day later, he defeated **Lu Huaiyuan**!
- Currently at large!

This news sent shockwaves through the cultivation world.

How could someone who had cultivated for less than a year surpass the renowned Lu Huaiyuan?

Had he restrained his greed and not committed such crimes, could he have taken the position of Daoist heir from Lu Huaiyuan and potentially become the next Sect Leader?

"A single year of cultivation, yet such strength—truly a prodigy."

"Even more terrifying is that despite committing such grave crimes, he managed to escape the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's territory unscathed?"

"Legends say that even a Human Immortal Supreme Elder who defected in the past was intercepted and killed within the sect's borders. This kid is simply unbelievable!"

"What a pity. The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect has lost a future pillar of their sect."

"If he weren't a traitor to the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, under any other circumstances, I'd have gladly taken him in as my disciple. With him inheriting my legacy, our sect would surely flourish!"

"Actually, if he could change his identity and lay low, there might still be a chance to recruit him."

Various factions were tempted, including the Great Zhou Imperial Court, all moved by the desire to nurture talent.

A person like this, who could defeat Lu Huaiyuan after just a year of cultivation—given more time, wouldn't he become a transcendent Human Immortal?

If they could recruit him now, their faction would soon gain another Human Immortal!

Meanwhile, the now-infamous Li Zhengjing stood under the moonlight, his expression sorrowful as he murmured:

"*I raise my head to gaze at the bright moon,  
And lower it, thinking of my hometown.*"

He sighed deeply, glancing at the little horned girl beside him. "I miss home. Do you? Every time I think of home, my heart aches, and tears threaten to fall..."

The dragon girl yawned, rested her head on his lap, and promptly fell asleep.

"..."

Li Zhengjing's expression turned complicated, tinged with disappointment. *This little ingrate doesn't miss home at all? The source of her spirit stones seems unreliable...*

He glanced at the Five Elements Creation Tree beside him. *At least the tree and the Wave-Severing Gu are dependable.*

With that thought, he took out the Wave-Severing Gu and let it bite his hand.

This time, the venom was more potent, and the spiritual energy it provided was three times stronger. However, afterward, the Wave-Severing Gu seemed dazed, its antennae drooping limply.

"Little Wave-Severing, your constitution is too weak. You need more exercise."

After offering some encouragement, he placed the gu back into its phoenix tree box.

"We should reach our destination tomorrow," Yuan Zhengfeng's voice sounded. "Back then, the White Azure Venerable left the Wall-Climbing Bird there, waiting for us to pick it up. Have you thought about where to go after retrieving it?"

"The capital," Li Zhengjing replied. "The Venom King Xin Xuan lurked in the capital for half a year, poisoning the Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace. He had already stirred up trouble half a year ago, yet the Great Zhou Imperial Court failed to capture him. Who provided him shelter? It's said that Xin Xuan was backed by the Debt Collector, but perhaps it wasn't the one we killed?"

"That's just your speculation. What if it was the previous Debt Collector and not the one behind it all?" Yuan Zhengfeng countered.

"No." Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page. It had previously revealed that during that time, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord had gone to the capital!

Currently, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord was still in the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.

Not only was Li Zhengjing now a sect traitor, unable to return, but even if his name were cleared, he couldn't stay under the Divine Lord's watchful gaze.

Moreover, investigating the Divine Lord's tracks in front of such an ancient monster would be suicide.

Only now, with the Divine Lord absent from the capital, could he safely investigate.

"Besides, there's also the Kunlun Immortal Sect."

Li Zhengjing mused, *When I first met the Kunlun Young Master, the golden page indicated that he would deduce my connection to the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord based on the Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi in my possession. Back then, the page explicitly mentioned the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, not the Debt Collector...*

He had a vague feeling that the Kunlun Immortal Sect—the first sect to be targeted by the Debt Collector, and the birthplace of figures like the Celestial Azure Dao Venerable—might hold more secrets than other factions.

The previous dynasty's opportunities had been harvested by the Debt Collector, leading to its collapse and the world descending into chaos. Only when the Great Zhou Dynasty reestablished order did peace return.

The Great Zhou's State Preceptor had nurtured opportunities over three generations spanning two thousand years, and now they were ripe for harvest.

The Luofu Immortal Sect's opportunities, obtained after Kunlun's, had already been harvested.

Thus, Kunlun's opportunities, being the earliest, should have long been ripe—yet they remained unharvested. As the foremost of the three great immortal sects, had the Celestial Azure Dao Venerable left behind countermeasures to prevent the "true Debt Collector" from harvesting them?

Or were Kunlun's opportunities unique, requiring nearly four thousand years to mature?

"First, the capital. Then, Kunlun Immortal Sect."

Li Zhengjing murmured, "It's been a long time since I've been home."

With the Crown Prince of Great Zhou assassinated, the capital was in turmoil. The Jian'an Marquis's residence, caught in the storm, would inevitably be affected. It was time for him to return.

Fortunately, the Ancient Moon Peak Master had severed his ties to his origins, ensuring the Marquis's household wouldn't suffer for his crimes.

"Let's rest for now. At dawn, we'll find the Wall-Climbing Bird."

The forest fell silent once more, bathed in moonlight.

The night passed without incident. At sunrise, they set off for the Wall-Climbing Bird's last known location.

"Just ahead, at the foot of the volcano. The White Azure Venerable left it there to train its Blazing Fire divine ability."

"Wall-Climber!"

Li Zhengjing called out, but there was no response.

After searching the area, they realized the bird was gone.

"Did its grandfather take it back to the sect a few days ago?" the Five Elements Creation Tree exclaimed. "If so, and they encountered danger on the way back, wouldn't our poor Wall-Climber be reduced to ashes? Oh, my dear Wall-Climber..."

"Isn't it a bit early for tears?" Yuan Zhengfeng said dryly. "This area is near a volcano, but the traces of fire seem recent."

"So the Wall-Climbing Bird used its Blazing Fire ability here?"

Li Zhengjing frowned. "It waited here for days, then used its ability and vanished? Could it have been captured?"

"About ten miles northwest, there's smoke. Let's check there first." Yuan Zhengfeng, with his Human Immortal senses, made the suggestion.

"Alright."

Li Zhengjing didn't hesitate and headed forward.

A village lay ahead. Upon entering, the villagers eyed his fine robes with suspicion. But when Li Zhengjing produced silver, their wariness faded, and they deemed him trustworthy, answering all his questions.

At noon yesterday, strange winds and rain had gathered over the volcano to the southeast, accompanied by flames. The villagers had feared a wildfire.

Later, they learned that a bizarre bird had appeared on the mountain—a rare and wondrous creature. The Wan Clan of Linyuan Prefecture had captured it alive, intending to use it as a sacrificial offering to the gods. They had widely publicized the event.

"Sacrificial offering?" Li Zhengjing was stunned. Had the Wall-Climbing Bird escaped being a sacrificial offering at Fengdu Mountain, only to meet the same fate here?

"Indeed. In three months, the Wan Clan will welcome the statue of the Southern Domain's Divine Mother into Linyuan Prefecture for public worship." The village elder sighed. "In three days, an auspicious date, they'll begin constructing a temple. First, they'll pray to heaven and earth, and that divine bird is one of the offerings."

"Southern Domain's Divine Mother." Yuan Zhengfeng's voice echoed in Li Zhengjing's ear. "I've heard of her. She's one of the six great deities of the Southern Domain, officially recognized by the Great Zhou Dynasty and entitled to receive mortal worship. Rumor has it she was once the Heavenly Jun Prince, a meritorious subject who aided the Great Zhou's founding emperor. After his death eight hundred years ago, he replaced the original Divine Mother."

"Heavenly Jun Prince? Replaced the Divine Mother?" Li Zhengjing was surprised.

"The current Southern Domain worships the second incarnation of the Divine Mother."

Yuan Zhengfeng explained, "Of course, ordinary mortals don't know the truth. To them, the Divine Mother is the deity their ancestors have worshipped for generations—a faith upheld for two thousand years."

He elaborated further.

The Southern Domain lay within the Great Zhou Dynasty's southern territories, bordering the Southern Wastelands.

The divine body had been obtained two thousand years ago by a Human Immortal from the Southern Wastelands. Before his death, he used his power to spread the Divine Mother's name, earning the people's reverence.

After his mortal body perished, his divine power inhabited the divine body, allowing him to enjoy the Southern Domain's worship.

"Later, when the Great Zhou Dynasty established its rule over Central Province, its armies pressed south. The first Divine Mother chose to submit to the Great Zhou's founding emperor, retaining her worship rights..."

Yuan Zhengfeng continued, "After her death, the divine body remained... Until eight hundred years ago, when the Heavenly Jun Prince, a founding hero, passed away. His divine power entered the divine body, becoming the current Divine Mother."

"I see."

Li Zhengjing nodded, then asked the village elder about the Wan Clan of Linyuan, who had captured the Wall-Climbing Bird.

"The Wan Clan of Linyuan Prefecture is a true noble family. Rumor has it their ancestors achieved immortality, blessing their descendants."

The elder sighed. "Throughout Linyuan Prefecture, the Wan Clan has branches in every county—high-ranking officials, wealthy merchants. Their influence isn't limited to Linyuan; even in the capital, there are Wan officials..."

He stroked his beard. "Even the Prefect of Linyuan treats the Wan Clan's patriarch with utmost respect. Truly enviable!"

"Ancestors who achieved immortality?"

Yuan Zhengfeng suddenly realized something. "I recall a Wan ancestor in the Luofu Immortal Sect, also from the Southern Domain. Could they be related?"

Li Zhengjing mused, "If so, then the Wan Clan of Linyuan would be akin to the Chen Clan of the Ancient Moon Peak in the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect?"

"More or less. But it seems the Linyuan Wan Clan is the mortal branch. Just as the Chen Clan's main lineage can join the immortal sect, there are mortal Chen descendants scattered across other prefectures and counties..."

Li Zhengjing exhaled. "Regardless, since the Wall-Climbing Bird is in the Wan Clan's hands, we must pay them a visit."

He bid the elder farewell and left.

Some villagers, tempted by his silver, considered robbing him, but the elder stopped them, saving their lives.

"This man carries himself nobly, wears fine clothes, and bears a sword. He's no commoner. Moreover, he travels alone with a child through the mountains, unafraid of wild beasts. If you try to rob him, you might lose your lives."

"..."

Li Zhengjing glanced back and smiled. "Even in the countryside, there are wise men."

A village meant a town wasn't far. Soon, they reached a county city.

However, the Wan Clan's ancestral lands lay not here but in Linyuan Prefecture's capital.

For Li Zhengjing, the distance was trivial. In just two hours, he arrived at Linyuan's capital and inquired about the Wan Clan.

The Wan Clan's estate was grand and imposing. At the gates, guards stopped him.

Without a word, Li Zhengjing flicked his sleeve, releasing True Qi that shattered the stone lions flanking the entrance.

"Esteemed senior, please wait! We'll summon the patriarch at once!"

Soon, an elder emerged—likely at the Inner Qi realm—and bowed. "This humble one is Wan Jihe."

"..."

Li Zhengjing assessed him. The man was at the fourth layer of Inner Qi, but his aura was weak—far inferior to an Ancient Moon Peak Inner Sect disciple of the same level.

His advanced age and inferior cultivation method were likely to blame. Even if the Wan ancestor was a high-ranking Luofu Immortal Sect elder, sect rules would forbid him from leaking immortal techniques to mortal descendants. The techniques bestowed upon them were likely mediocre.

If so, how had the Wall-Climbing Bird—a divine White Luan-blooded creature, trained in immortal techniques and enhanced by the Ghost Valley Spirit Physician—fallen into the Wan Clan's hands?

"Patriarch Wan, I come with a request."

"Brother Daoist, speak freely." Wan Jihe bowed.

"I heard your clan recently captured a divine bird—a rare and peculiar creature—intending to sacrifice it. Is this true?"

"It is."

"That's my bird." Li Zhengjing said calmly. "Release it to me, and this matter ends here."

"..." Wan Jihe's expression shifted, then he shook his head. "No."

"Why?" Li Zhengjing rested his hand on the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber.

"That divine bird is priceless. For you to demand it with just a word is unreasonable."

Wan Jihe said slowly, "Even if it were truly yours, the Wan Clan would compensate you, but we cannot simply let you take it. Our dignity is at stake."

He met Li Zhengjing's gaze. "Moreover, the list of offerings has already been submitted to the Southern Domain Divine Mother's altar. If anything is missing on the day of the sacrifice, who will bear the goddess's wrath?"

Li Zhengjing fell silent. "So, I can't take my bird today?"

Wan Jihe glanced at the shattered stone lions. "You are clearly a young genius, already at the True Qi realm—worthy of being a True Disciple in an immortal sect. But the Wan Clan is no pushover."

He waved his hand, and three True Qi cultivators emerged from the clan's estate.

For a mere mortal clan like the Wan Clan, having three True Qi cultivators—though weaker than immortal sect elders—was impressive.

Meanwhile, the sound of armored horses approached. Government forces had arrived, including a True Qi commander.

"Four True Qi cultivators. Though their foundations are shaky, if they captured the Wall-Climbing Bird with this lineup, it makes sense." Yuan Zhengfeng remarked. "But I suspect the Wan Clan might have a hidden expert—perhaps someone who fled the Luofu Immortal Sect's turmoil."

"So what?"

Li Zhengjing drew his saber and advanced.

"Who dares trespass on Wan Clan grounds?"

A True Qi elder stepped forward, flanked by two others. Their auras intertwined, forming a Three Talents Formation, amplifying their power.

"Young and arrogant, with True Qi strength—no wonder you're bold. But this is no place for recklessness!"

"Our Wan ancestor is the Luofu Immortal Sect's Sixth Peak's Guardian Elder, a Human Immortal! Our clan also has young True Qi talents who are True Disciples in the sect."

"Out of respect for your talent and youth, leave now, and we'll let this matter rest."

The three elders pressed forward as the cavalry drew near.

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "Immortal sect True Disciples? Who isn't one?"

He reached for his waist, then remembered he no longer had his Golden-Edged Silver Token. He was no longer a Feather Transformation Immortal Sect disciple.

Sighing, he stepped into the Three Talents Formation. "This junior, Li Zhengjing, seeks your guidance."

"..."

Silence fell.

The formation's aura dissipated as the three elders retreated.

The approaching cavalry, hearing Li Zhengjing's words, turned and left.

"Li Zhengjing of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's Ancient Moon Peak, Golden-Edged Silver Token disciple?" The lead elder's voice was low.

"That's in the past." Li Zhengjing sighed. "I stole spirit stones, was caught, killed three Inner Sect Elders and thirty-six disciples, then fled. Now I'm just a sectless traitor. Enough talk—let's fight. I still need to find my bird..."

"Esteemed Immortal Li, wait! The divine bird is in the rear courtyard. We'll bring it to you at once!"

Meanwhile, in the rear courtyard.

A young man sat with closed eyes, listening to the bird's cries and sensing the shifting auras ahead. Suddenly, his eyes snapped open.

"He hasn't even reached the peak of the True Qi realm. How did he defeat Lu Huaiyuan?"

He clenched his fists. "I just arrived in Linyuan, and he comes under the pretense of 'finding his bird.' Has he caught wind of something? The Diamond Temple's Buddhist heir should have arrived by now after my message. Where is he?"
