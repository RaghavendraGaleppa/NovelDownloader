# Chapter 98: Merging with the Dao's Intent

Ten days later.

In the lightless depths of the abyss.

Zhang Jing sat upon a fragment of a colossal turtle's remains—spanning tens of thousands of zhang like a small continent—with his eyes closed, seemingly sensing something.

He had stumbled upon these remains three days prior.

Whatever had transpired in the past, it was enough to kill even such an existence within the Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven.

Yet Zhang Jing had no interest in investigating further.

Before long.

His eyes snapped open, gleaming with excitement.

The Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light had fully recovered!

He then glanced at the Dao pattern in his hand.

[Spiritual Essence: 512,860]

"This should be enough," he thought, though not entirely certain.

Zhang Jing had considered using this opportunity to hunt more spirit beasts and accumulate additional spiritual essence, thereby gaining more time to comprehend the Dao's intent.

However, after careful deliberation.

He decisively abandoned the idea.

What exactly was "enough"?

Would he not feel that 300,000 spiritual essence was "more" after obtaining an extra 100,000?

The Myriad Gods' Void Heaven only lasted a year, meaning the Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light could only be used eleven times. Each opportunity was precious—how could he afford to waste any by delaying?

Moreover, this was only the Fourth Void Heaven!

Having made up his mind.

Zhang Jing's figure flickered and vanished from the spot.

He arrived at a familiar place.

This time, however, he did not head toward the right gate as before.

The left gate slowly creaked open.

"Oh, back again? Just here to look?" Young Master crossed his legs and glanced at Zhang Jing, smirking.

Seeing this.

Zhang Jing took a deep breath and spoke deliberately:

"Young Master, I'd like one qian of Enlightenment Tea and two Spiritual Bodhi Fruits."

Hearing this.

Young Master gave Zhang Jing a surprised look, as if wondering how someone in the mere Fourth Void Heaven could possess so much spiritual essence.

But he didn't ask, merely waving his small hand.

The Spiritual Bodhi Fruits and Enlightenment Tea materialized before Zhang Jing.

At the same time, his spiritual essence silently decreased by 110,000.

"I'll take my leave now," Zhang Jing said respectfully.

Young Master waved him off.

Next door.

Upon spotting Zhang Jing, Infant Master's eyes lit up as he whined pitifully:

"Zhang Jing, you're finally here!"

"Come take a look—is this 'transformation block' broken? Why can't I recover no matter what?"

"Infant Master, this thing is perfectly fine..."

Eventually.

Zhang Jing wiped the sweat from his brow.

After much explanation and encouragement, he managed to placate Infant Master.

"Still going for the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent?" Infant Master asked curiously, his bright eyes fixed on Zhang Jing.

Zhang Jing nodded.

In the next instant.

Darkness enveloped his vision.

He found himself in the familiar, empty space once more.

With practiced ease, Zhang Jing sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion, closing his eyes to adjust his state to its peak.

This time, he couldn't afford to be careless!

Success meant glimpsing the profundities of the Dao's intent; failure would mean wasting both the month's time and the precious opportunity to use the Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light.

Not that it would be a complete waste.

But it was still an outcome Zhang Jing found hard to accept.

Time passed slowly.

Zhang Jing placed a Spiritual Bodhi Fruit in his mouth, bit through its skin, and swallowed it whole.

An unbearable bitterness instantly flooded his senses.

Unfazed, he retrieved the Enlightenment Tea.

One qian amounted to only two leaves, each crystalline and translucent, exuding a refreshing fragrance.

Their veins naturally formed intricate Dao patterns, shimmering with spiritual light and emanating an air of profound mystery.

Without hesitation.

He placed both leaves on his tongue, pressing them gently against his palate.

This was the method Young Master had recommended.

Zhang Jing had no choice but to trust it.

Despite his unpleasant personality, Young Master likely had some professional ethics.

The next moment.

The Heart's Eye Dao Seed was activated at full power!

Crimson Divine Light and Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light surged from within him.

Zhang Jing's eyes snapped open, gleaming with excitement and anticipation.

With over 412,000 spiritual essence remaining, he could meditate for 1,236 breaths—far longer than a quarter-hour.

Last time, he had counted his sessions breath by breath.

Now, he could measure them in quarters.

"Begin comprehension!" he silently commanded.

Instantly.

The vision of a dragon coiled around the moon reappeared before him.

Zhang Jing stared unblinkingly, his eyes empty.

Under the combined effects of the Enlightenment Tea, Spiritual Bodhi Fruit, Crimson Divine Light, and most crucially, the Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light, his mind was fully immersed in the vast and majestic Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent.

This time.

Zhang Jing felt as though he had become the Lunar Serpent itself.

Born without protection.

Forced to survive alone in a savage, lawless world.

Celestial beasts roared, shaking stars from the sky; primordial creatures shattered the boundless earth; colossal deities taller than the heavens split the firmament, causing rivers of stars to pour forth and the world to collapse.

In time.

It grew stronger, step by step, until it became a mighty celestial beast, reigning over millions of miles.

Then one day.

The sky shattered.

A giant hand, glowing with lunar radiance, reached down and plucked it away.

Time flowed like water.

Zhang Jing opened his eyes, his gaze dazed.

It felt as though he had dreamed a life spanning tens of thousands of years, yet he couldn't recall a single detail.

Suddenly.

Countless Dao rhythms swirled in his heart.

Among them were the principles of the serpent—evolution, savagery, and primordial nature—intertwined with the Dao of the Lunar, embodying the rules of extreme darkness, cold, and yin.

There were also the Dao principles of overturning seas, summoning winds, and commanding rains.

Finally.

All these Dao rhythms merged, condensing into a wisp of intent—faint yet terrifyingly potent.

An unknown amount of time later.

A glimmer of understanding flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

"The Lunar Serpent is untamed, overturning seas and skies, summoning winds and rains, drawing upon the Lunar essence."

Moreover.

He had begun to grasp the nature of the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent.

It might, in essence, be the condensed path and principles of that very Lunar Serpent.

A fusion of the serpent's evolutionary principles as its body, the Lunar principles as its soul, and the intertwined laws of sea, wind, cloud, and rain.

To fully comprehend the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent would be akin to becoming a miniature, weakened version of the Lunar Serpent itself.

"The foundation of the Dao... is this what it means?"

Zhang Jing's thoughts raced!

He had caught a fleeting glimpse of this world's path of cultivation—but only a glimpse.

More questions arose.

Yet for now, there were no answers.

The jade talisman slowly materialized.

The previous Nether Serpent Devouring Void Dao rhythm had vanished, replaced by: [Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent (1/1000)].

The moment he saw the change.

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened.

Why didn't the jade talisman use "completed" to describe the Dao Intent as before?

Ah, it was because his comprehension was still too shallow...

He tentatively touched the [Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent (1/1000)] on the talisman.

A message flashed in his mind.

Zhang Jing's expression became inscrutable.

He wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry.

The good news was that the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent could be leveled up through experience. The bad news was that experience could only be gained during comprehension sessions.

"In other words, the jade talisman ensures I gain something from each session."

This outcome.

Zhang Jing could live with.

At the very worst.

Even if he left now, he would still have a superior cyan-grade Dao foundation.

Exiting the Myriad Gods' Treasure Vault.

Zhang Jing reappeared where he had vanished.

Seeing the faint traces of spirit beasts in the distance, a look of eager anticipation crossed his face.

With a thought.

The Five Treasures Spiritual River materialized beside him.

Zhang Jing stepped onto it.

The wisp of Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent he had just comprehended slowly infused the river, unleashing the serpent's savage, tyrannical aura in all directions.

In an instant.

Every spirit beast within a ten-li radius of Zhang Jing sensed the overwhelming terror and fled desperately.

Where could they run?

Zhang Jing smiled faintly.

He channeled his full power into the Five Treasures Spiritual River, intensifying the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent.

Roar—!

A primordial roar, as if from the distant past, echoed in his ears.

Under the Dao Intent's influence, the spiritual river transformed, taking the shape of a hundred-zhang-long black serpent. The river's spells became scales, its magical tools turned into bones.

The Frostwind Banner, a treasure, appeared unbidden above, forming a crystalline white horn that radiated extreme cold.

With a single flick of its tail.

The serpent, carrying Zhang Jing, shot forward like a streak of dark light, covering dozens of li in an instant.

The fleeing spirit beasts were reduced to glittering shards of ice, scattering across the ocean floor.
