# Chapter 17: Spirit Root Seed?

"Right, I should get a water basin."

Judging from the stone's reaction to the white-haired scalekin, Jiang Li was seventy percent certain that it contained a scalekin egg—the offspring of that white-haired scalekin.

Which raised the question: What use was an albino scalekin egg?

He fetched a basin, filled it halfway with well water, then held the stone above it like cracking an egg. Using his thumbnail to wedge into the stone's crevice, he gradually increased the pressure!

Jiang Li was now a genuine internal martial artist, with grip strength comparable to iron pliers. His fingernails, infused with internal energy, were sharper and tougher than daggers.

The barely noticeable crack slowly widened, revealing a white viscous substance that had sealed the stone together.

With a sudden forceful twist—


*Crack!*

A round object fell from the stone into the basin, splashing water before floating to the surface.

This... was a seed?

**[Name: Spirit Root Seed?]  
[Type: Miscellaneous]  
[Grade: Unknown]  
[Note: Not recommended for consumption.]**

He had guessed wrong. Hidden inside the stone wasn't a scalekin egg but something identified as a **[Spirit Root Seed?]**.

Spirit root... Could this be the spirit root I'm thinking of?

If it's called a Spirit Root Seed, does that mean planting it in soil and watering it would grow an actual spirit root?

Jiang Li was baffled. Shouldn't a spirit root be an abstract innate talent for cultivation?

Aside from his "family jewels," he didn't think he had any other organ that could be called a "spirit root."

Moreover, the name "Spirit Root Seed" was followed by a question mark—something that had never appeared in his appraisal skill before. Jiang Li wasn't sure what that signified.

"Strange thing."

After confirming there was nothing else inside the stone shell, Jiang Li picked up the seed and examined it. Aside from its hard outer shell, he found nothing noteworthy.

After some thought, he took a clay pot from the backyard, filled it with soil, watered it thoroughly, and planted the seed inside.

This thing likely had some value. Since the appraisal skill warned against eating it, planting it seemed like the logical next step.

He placed the pot on a table by the second-floor window, where it could receive sunlight when the window was opened.

Later, Yan Hong visited again, delivering the monthly stipends collected from their nineteen subordinates.

Each lower-grade spirit root disciple received one spirit stone, five Qi Recovery Pills, and five Qi Nourishing Pills as their monthly stipend.

In total, that amounted to nineteen spirit stones, ninety-five Qi Recovery Pills, and ninety-five Qi Nourishing Pills.

First, they reclaimed their initial investment—Jiang Li took back eight spirit stones, while Yan Hong retrieved two. The remaining resources were split evenly between them.

Though their subordinates hadn't voiced complaints, resentment was inevitable. It seemed they'd need some "motivational counseling" soon.

"Jiang Li, I've heard that for initial Qi refinement, upper-grade spirit root disciples usually take at least ten days, with some needing up to a month. Middle-grade spirit root disciples typically require one to three months, and that's with diligent daily meditation. Lower-grade and inferior-grade spirit roots? Many don't even achieve Qi induction by the end of their first year."

The path of cultivation was long and arduous, leaving both of them sighing in resignation.

"Take it slow. Once you achieve Qi induction, you can start using pills to assist your progress. It'll get easier."

They had dinner together again. The food in the Hidden Scripture Valley's outer sect was surprisingly good—balanced meals with unlimited portions. However, none of the new disciples had much appetite for indulgence.

Both ate quickly, grumbled about the difficulty of cultivation techniques, then dutifully returned to their meditation.

---

Over the next few weeks, Jiang Li devoted most of his time to mastering the cultivation technique.

He attended several lectures at the outer sect's grand hall. While basic literacy classes were held daily, the weekly lectures by elders were the truly valuable ones—covering topics like the origins of cultivation, interpreting terminology, common beginner mistakes, and pill consumption guidelines.

The most popular segments were the elders' tales of the cultivation world—tidbits of practical knowledge rarely found in books but essential for progress.

"Today's lecture was perfectly timed. I've been stuck on that bottleneck for five days with no progress. Tonight, I'm sure I'll make a breakthrough."

Yan Hong was excited, as if he were on the verge of entering the Qi Refinement stage.

"Same here. I'd only been focusing on the timing aspect of cultivation, ignoring everything else. No wonder my progress felt so sluggish."

Jiang Li also had an epiphany.

"By the way, did you manage to get what I asked for?"

"Yeah, it's in my courtyard. But spending a whole spirit stone on that... You're taking a huge loss."

Yan Hong looked displeased, but Jiang Li didn't mind. Value was subjective, and urgency came at a price.

In Yan Hong's backyard lay a massive log—thick enough that two people could barely wrap their arms around it. Checking the rings, Jiang Li confirmed the tree was sixty-nine years old—older than his combined age across two lifetimes.

"Perfect. Thanks, brother. This is a huge help."

It was a simple locust tree log. While such wood could be bought with mortal currency, finding one over sixty years old wasn't easy. Stuck in the sect, Jiang Li had no choice but to pay the steep price of one spirit stone.

He lifted the log—weighing at least eight hundred jin—with a grunt, channeling his internal energy through the *Sui Hu Gong* technique, and hoisted it onto his shoulder.

"With this, you'd better start calling me 'senior brother.'"

Confident, Jiang Li carried the heavy log toward a remote area of the outer sect. Night had fallen, and he wasn't heading back to his quarters but to a desolate graveyard—the outer sect's mass burial ground.

From conversations with Yu Banxia, Jiang Li had learned that while the Hidden Scripture Valley recruited six to seven hundred disciples annually, the outer sect's numbers remained stable at around eight thousand. Only a handful advanced to the inner sect each year.

So where did the rest go?

Some died from cultivation mishaps, others in conflicts, and many on dangerous missions. With one or two deaths daily, centuries of accumulation had created this sprawling graveyard.

Under the moonlight, tombstones and burial mounds stretched endlessly, packed so densely that walking caused brittle snapping sounds beneath the soil—likely from the bones buried inches below.

"Spirits, forgive my intrusion..."

Such a massive, long-standing burial site was practically guaranteed to spawn restless spirits and corpses. Fortunately, in a cultivation sect, any supernatural threats were swiftly dealt with. In the mortal world, this place would have become a haunted wasteland.

Finding a relatively flat spot, Jiang Li drove the locust log into the ground with a forceful slam.

"Damn... My internal energy's almost drained."

After resting to recover, he prepared for his true purpose here. Kicking off his shoes, he stood barefoot in the cold, damp soil—an oddly soothing sensation.

Under the moonlight, his shadow merged with the log. Raising his arms, his silhouette resembled branches sprouting from the locust wood.

Eyes closed, Jiang Li began cultivating the *Ghost Wood Art* amidst the graveyard's oppressive yin energy.

The locust tree—known as the "ghost among trees." Its roots drink from the underworld's springs; its leaves shroud the moon's gaze.

This time, his cultivation felt entirely different. The cold, yin-aligned wood energy was palpable, growing stronger by the moment.

This was no surprise. Outer sect disciples, though weak by cultivation standards, were still cultivators. Their deaths generated far more yin energy and resentment than ordinary mortals. Over two centuries, this graveyard had interred tens of thousands, transforming it into a yin convergence point.

Locust wood, being yin-attuned and ghost-attracting, was traditionally forbidden near graves. Yet Jiang Li had planted a sixty-nine-year-old locust log right in the heart of this mass burial site.

Instantly, howling winds gathered as dense yin energy swirled toward him. Ghostly will-o'-wisps ignited in the air, their numbers multiplying until hundreds of eerie green flames orbited Jiang Li in a spectral dance.
