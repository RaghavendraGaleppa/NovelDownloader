# Chapter 14: Sir, I Want to Live (Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!)

Under the night sky, flames reflected across the heavens, painting the world crimson as if the very earth were ablaze.

Long Ying's tattooed face twisted grotesquely, his eyes burning with malice as he glared at Feng Zhongyi. His intact left arm slowly rose, the broad-boned palm poised to deliver a skull-crushing blow that would end Feng Zhongyi's life.

Defeat had come before battle—a humiliating, senseless rout.

Their enemies were few, merely setting a few fires that should have been easily extinguished. Had Long Ying maintained his position guarding the prison with strict defense, they could have held. Yet this coward before him had panicked, triggering a chain reaction. No one fought the flames, allowing them to spread unchecked until they consumed the village, forcing their retreat lest they be burned alive.

Even now, after withdrawing, Feng Zhongyi continued his hysterical wailing, spewing nothing but demoralizing drivel.

"Shut your mouth!" Long Ying barked.

As Feng Zhongyi fell silent, Long Ying's gaze shifted to the distant figure of Dou Changsheng, who approached with hands clasped behind his back, exuding the majestic aura of a grandmaster. Long Ying spoke calmly, "I, Long Ying, am no coward who trembles at the mere title of 'grandmaster.'"

"If he truly were one, why resort to such elaborate schemes—setting fires instead of simply walking into the village? I've only just completed the Five Qi Convergence, barely reaching the Xiantian realm. A true Yin Grandmaster who has shed their mortal form could kill me with ease."

His broad left hand slowly drew a five-foot whip from his waist, its segmented steel links resembling a centipede's body. As Long Ying channeled his Xiantian true energy, the flexible weapon stiffened, transforming into a rigid spear.

"I don't believe it. Let me see for myself—is there truly a grandmaster here?"

With a sudden flick of his arm, his sleeve ballooned like an inflated bladder, vibrating violently as the whip softened again. It lashed through the air with a thunderous crack, true energy erupting like a raging river, obliterating earth and stone in its path.

This was no probing strike—Long Ying had committed everything, prepared to die testing a grandmaster's mettle.

Feng Zhongyi watched, eyes bulging in disbelief. What madness was this? By confronting Dou Changsheng so recklessly, Long Ying was signing their death warrants!

The unspoken rule was clear: go through the motions, then report back. What did they earn that justified such suicidal bravery? This "Dou Changsheng" was clearly a disguised scion of the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou. Kill him now, and though the Wangs might feign indifference during the northern conflicts, their grandmasters would surely come "traveling" later—"accidentally" eliminating the perpetrators. Would the Imperial Chancellor truly punish the Wangs over such expendable tools?

No. The smart play was to pretend Dou Changsheng had Wang Clan protection. At worst, they'd receive some meaningless reprimands. Did Long Ying truly believe stripping the Wang name from the family register erased blood ties?

Fury and terror warred within Feng Zhongyi. Did Long Ying think he'd fled earlier out of cowardice when Earthwalker died? No—he'd recognized that killing Dou Changsheng would bring punishment, not reward!

Now Long Ying's stubbornness threatened to expose Feng Zhongyi's earlier retreat as calculated betrayal rather than tactical withdrawal. If this reached their superiors' ears... Feng Zhongyi's gaze turned murderous as it lingered on Long Ying's exposed back.

The other guards were mere Houtian realm warriors—easy prey for his speed. But against Long Ying's strength, direct assault was impossible. As he watched Long Ying's whip surge forward with tsunami-like force, Feng Zhongyi's eyes flickered with calculation.

Wait—that all-out attack left Long Ying completely unguarded from behind.

Two options crystallized: strike now, or flee. But where could he run from the Imperial Chancellor's reach? Defection required powerful patronage... like the Wang Clan's.

In that instant, Feng Zhongyi—a man who'd never known loyalty—made his choice. With a sudden whirlwind step that outpaced most Xiantian experts, he appeared beside Long Ying.

"Even a grandmaster only means death!" Feng Zhongyi declared loudly. "Let me aid you, sir!"

Long Ying had barely registered surprise when searing pain erupted in his back—a flexible sword piercing through organs, shredding everything within. Darkness swallowed him before he could speak, his corpse collapsing mid-stride.

Such was the martial world's cruelty: a moment's lapse meant death.

Feng Zhongyi landed lightly beside the body, sighing as he whispered to the corpse, "Sir... I wanted to live."
