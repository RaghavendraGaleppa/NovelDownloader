# Chapter 113: The Senior Brothers' Request

Pushing the door open gently, Zhang Jing's gaze fell upon two figures standing quietly one behind the other. A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.

"Senior brothers, weren't you out hunting spirit beasts? Why have you returned so suddenly?"

"Haha, junior brother, you've only been in the Eighth Void Heaven for a month. We were worried you might get lost," Yang Bai replied with a laugh. "After discussing with Senior Brother Liu and calculating the time, we figured you should have finished refining your magic treasure embryo by now, so we came back to fetch you."

But then his expression suddenly turned somewhat awkward as he stammered, "Of course... there's also... also..."

Seeing his hesitation, Senior Brother Liu shook his head with a smile and turned to Zhang Jing, speaking earnestly: 

"Junior brother, here's the situation. Brother Yang and I discovered another treasure spirit beast yesterday. This creature is quite powerful—even working together, we're having difficulty dealing with it. That's why we returned to ask for your help. Would you have time now?"

"That's right, junior brother," Yang Bai chimed in, now that the matter was out in the open. "Your current strength is already comparable to mine, and you've just obtained a superior-grade magic treasure embryo. With you joining us, the three of us can easily handle that treasure spirit beast."

Is that so? A look of understanding crossed Zhang Jing's face before he readily agreed: "No problem at all, senior brothers. When shall we set out?"

Truth be told, even if his senior brothers hadn't come looking for him, Zhang Jing had been planning to go hunt spirit beasts to quickly accumulate spiritual essence and complete his comprehension of the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent. Their arrival suited his purposes perfectly—having guides familiar with the Eighth Void Heaven would only accelerate his spirit beast hunting and essence gathering.

"How about right now? Do you need to prepare anything else?" Liu Lizhi asked with a smile.

After a moment's thought, Zhang Jing shook his head. "Nothing else. Let's depart."

Soon after, three streaks of light shot into the sky.

Half an hour later, they landed in a clearing beside a barren hill.

"We're here. Be careful, junior brother," Yang Bai cautioned, pointing at the nearby hill.

As Zhang Jing's feet touched the ground, his eyes took in the sight before him—a low, barren hill no more than a few dozen zhang tall, its grayish surface completely devoid of vegetation. Not a single tree or blade of grass grew upon it, making it stand out strangely against its surroundings.

"Is it inside the mountain?" Zhang Jing asked.

"You'll know in a moment. Be extremely careful—this beast is quite troublesome!" Liu Lizhi warned softly, his expression turning serious as he gazed at the peculiar hill.

No sooner had he spoken than Zhang Jing felt a oppressive aura slowly emanating from the barren hill. The ground began to tremble slightly, as if something were crawling out from beneath the earth. Zhang Jing's expression grew focused.

Suddenly, crimson patterns appeared across the hill's surface, weaving into an intricate network that faintly formed mysterious Daoist markings, radiating waves of scorching heat.

BOOM!

Massive limbs burst forth from the hill, slamming heavily onto the ground, followed by a dragon-like head slowly emerging. With a series of collapsing sounds, an enormous shadow gradually fell over Zhang Jing.

"That's the treasure spirit beast?" Zhang Jing gaped in astonishment.

This dragon-turtle was undoubtedly the largest spirit beast he'd encountered since entering the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven.

Liu Lizhi's voice suddenly rang in his ears: "Junior brother, Brother Yang and I will hold this creature's attention. You look for opportunities to strike its vulnerable spots—the head, neck, and such. Remember, don't attack the shell. We've already tried—it's impervious."

In an instant, a golden light and a cyan light shot forth from behind him. Meanwhile, Yang Bai, his face grave, began tossing out small flags of various colors, apparently setting up an array to trap the dragon-turtle spirit beast.

But—was such elaborate preparation really necessary?

Zhang Jing couldn't help but smile at his senior brothers' nervous expressions as the black bracelet around his right wrist silently detached. To his current eyes, this enormous dragon-turtle was impressive in size alone—and utterly lacking in other merits.

Well, perhaps it did have one use: serving as a test subject for his improved Dark Lunar Serpent.

With this thought, Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed subtly.

As if receiving its command, the pitch-black serpent—no longer than a chopstick—gave a slight flick of its tail and transformed into a dim streak of light that shot straight toward the dragon-turtle. All its ferocious aura, which should have spread wildly, was now completely condensed within its small form, not leaking the slightest bit outward.

The Lunar energy it channeled was similarly concentrated to a single point.

There were no overwhelming fluctuations of power.

Yet in less than an instant, the shell that had so intimidated Zhang Jing's senior brothers yielded like tofu before the diminutive black serpent. Lunar energy erupted violently within the creature's body as the agile serpent, under Zhang Jing's control, rampaged through the dragon-turtle's innards, reducing all its organs to dust.

Witnessing this, Liu Lizhi and Yang Bai simultaneously halted their movements, staring at Zhang Jing in shock.

After a dozen breaths, the Dark Lunar Serpent returned to Zhang Jing's wrist, once again becoming a black bracelet.

A Daoist mark flashed on his palm.

[Spiritual Essence: +90,000]

"Senior brothers, you can divide this treasure spirit beast between yourselves," Zhang Jing said with an embarrassed smile.

He hadn't expected this seemingly formidable dragon-turtle spirit beast to perish so quickly.

Opposite him, Yang Bai stared at Zhang Jing, his mouth hanging open wordlessly. How had this junior brother's strength leaped forward yet again in just two or three days? Natural talent was one thing, but shouldn't there be some limits to reasonableness?

His gaze unconsciously swept over the black bracelet on Zhang Jing's wrist, envy flickering in his heart. What an incredible treasure! He wondered where Zhang Jing had obtained it. Though the question rose to his lips, he swallowed it back—it wouldn't do to pry into others' secrets.

Half a month later...

The Daoist mark on Zhang Jing's palm flickered faintly.

[Spiritual Essence: 5,273,100]

Excitement flashed uncontrollably in Zhang Jing's eyes. Thanks to the vastly enhanced power of his improved Dark Lunar Serpent, in just fifteen days he had hunted nearly three hundred spirit beasts, amassing this staggering amount of spiritual essence.

"This should be enough to elevate my Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent to forty percent comprehension," Zhang Jing mused thoughtfully. "With forty percent, I can advance to the Ninth Void Heaven."

With this thought, his figure flickered and vanished from the cave.
