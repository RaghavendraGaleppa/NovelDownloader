# Chapter 1: The Island Cultivator  

**The Starry Sea.**  

Turbulent waves crashed against the rocky shores of an island, startling seabirds that had been fishing along the reefs.  

This island resembled two gourds leaning against each other, featuring two freshwater lakes—one large, one small—earning it the name Twin Lakes Island. Beyond the lakes lay vast plains, dense forests, and a towering mountain range known as the Red Copper Mountains.  

**"Qi Refining, Third Layer—finally, a breakthrough!"**  

Inside a cave dwelling within the Red Copper Mountains, a young cultivator in a cyan robe, his hair tied in a Daoist knot, opened his eyes, his face alight with excitement. His features were refined, his eyes bright as stars.  

Before him, a three-inch-wide spirit vein gurgled, releasing wisps of spiritual energy. Without hesitation, Chen Daoxuan quickly sealed the vein with a stone disk engraved with intricate formation patterns.  

Only after ensuring the spirit vein was securely closed did he breathe a sigh of relief.  

This spirit vein was the last one the Chen Clan possessed, sustaining the cultivation of its only two remaining cultivators. If it were to dry up, Chen Daoxuan and his thirteenth uncle, Chen Xianhe, would have no choice but to absorb the sparse spiritual energy drifting in the air—severely hindering their progress.  

After tidying up, Chen Daoxuan stood and walked out of the cave.  

Just as he stepped outside, a graceful maidservant, her forehead glistening with sweat, hurried over and bowed.  

"Young Master, the Clan Leader requests your presence."  

Her voice was soft, her expression tinged with reverence.  

**"Understood. You may go."**  

**"Yes."**  

Once the maidservant left, Chen Daoxuan cast the Wind Riding Technique and soared toward another peak in the Red Copper Mountains.  

At sixteen, Chen Daoxuan had spent his entire life in this unfamiliar world. In his past life, he had been a mechanical engineer in Huaguo, Earth, until an accident claimed his life and reincarnated him here.  

With memories of his previous life intact, he had been thrilled to discover this was a world of cultivation, much like those in the novels and films he had once enjoyed.  

But reality quickly tempered his excitement.  

In his eyes, the cultivation world was far crueler than the civilized society he had known. This cruelty wasn't just about violence—it was the absolute monopoly that major sects and clans held over cultivation resources.  

In this world, small families and rogue cultivators could only scrape by on the scraps left behind by the powerful.  

The Chen Clan of Twin Lakes Island was a prime example of a minor cultivation family. At its peak, the clan had boasted thirteen Qi Refining cultivators, seven spirit veins, and even controlled a small first-grade spiritual mine—the Red Copper Mine.  

Lost in thought, Chen Daoxuan soon arrived at a peak dotted with pine trees.  

This was the cave dwelling of Chen Xianhe, the other remaining cultivator of the Chen Clan. Unlike Chen Daoxuan, who had just broken through to the third layer of Qi Refining, Chen Xianhe was already at the sixth layer.  

**"Thirteenth Uncle!"**  

Chen Daoxuan called out respectfully at the cave entrance.  

**"Come in."**  

A slightly aged voice echoed from within.  

Stepping inside, Chen Daoxuan saw an elderly man with silver hair and a youthful complexion seated on a jade bed, his gray-white robes neatly arranged. This was Chen Xianhe, the current leader of the Chen Clan.  

**"Thirteenth Uncle, you wished to see me?"**  

The old man's eyes flickered with joy before he quickly rose from the jade bed and approached Chen Daoxuan.  

**"Daoxuan, your cultivation—"**  

**"I’ve just broken through to the third layer."**  

Chen Daoxuan nodded, unable to suppress his own delight.  

**"Good! Good! Good!"**  

Chen Xianhe repeated the word three times, then sighed. **"To think that in just ten years since you began cultivating at six, you’ve progressed from the Mortal Realm’s Postnatal and Innate stages all the way to Qi Refining’s third layer. Truly, the heavens favor our Chen Clan!"**  

His expression darkened slightly. **"But with our clan’s decline, if your father and uncles were still here, they would have spared no expense to procure a Meridian Unblocking Pill for you. You wouldn’t have wasted five years stuck in the Mortal Realm."**  

In this world, both mortals and those with spiritual roots had to cultivate through the Mortal Realm—comprising the Postnatal and Innate stages.  

For mortals, the ninth layer of the Innate stage was their limit. Without spiritual roots, they could never refine spiritual energy and step onto the path of immortality.  

For cultivators, the Mortal Realm served only to temper the body and unblock meridians, laying the foundation for Qi Refining.  

Chen Daoxuan had started cultivating at six but didn’t break through to the first layer of Qi Refining until eleven. Over the next five years, he advanced to the third layer—averaging one layer every two and a half years.  

While this speed might seem unremarkable in major sects or clans, for a minor family like the Chens of Twin Lakes Island, it was extraordinary. Their resources were so scarce they barely surpassed those of rogue cultivators.  

Seeing the guilt in Chen Xianhe’s eyes, Chen Daoxuan quickly reassured him.  

**"Thirteenth Uncle, don’t say such things. If not for you saving me during the beast riots in Changping County ten years ago, I wouldn’t be alive today."**  

At the reminder, Chen Xianhe’s expression softened as he recalled the years spent mentoring Chen Daoxuan.  

Eager to shift the topic, Chen Daoxuan asked, **"Thirteenth Uncle, did you summon me to discuss the Red Copper Mine?"**  

**"Yes."**  

Chen Xianhe’s face turned grave. **"Though it’s only a minor vein, our clan’s survival hinges on it. But after three centuries of mining, its output has dwindled—from over a hundred pounds annually at its peak to less than five now. I suspect it’s nearing exhaustion."**  

Chen Daoxuan’s heart grew heavy.  

Without a spirit vein, the Red Copper Mine was the Chen Clan’s sole valuable resource. Yet even careful extraction couldn’t prolong its life forever.  

**"Since the mine is nearly depleted,"** Chen Xianhe continued, **"we might as well extract everything we can, rather than conserve what little remains."**  

**"Thirteenth Uncle, this—"**  

Chen Daoxuan was stunned.  

Abandoning careful extraction meant forsaking the clan’s lifeline—an act tantamount to squandering their heritage. But he understood Chen Xianhe’s true motive: to provide him with resources for learning artifact forging.  

Meeting his uncle’s resolute gaze, Chen Daoxuan swallowed his protests and bowed.  

**"This nephew will obey your command."**  

After discussing mining details, Chen Daoxuan prepared to leave.  

Just as he reached the cave entrance, Chen Xianhe’s voice called out behind him.  

**"Daoxuan, now that you’ve reached the third layer, our clan’s spirit vein can no longer sustain both of us. From now on… let it serve you alone."**  

The words struck Chen Daoxuan like a thunderbolt, freezing him in place.  

Turning back, his eyes reddened as he faced the silver-haired elder seated on the jade bed. With utmost reverence, he knelt and kowtowed deeply.  

**"Go now, go."**  

Chen Xianhe waved his sleeve, a faint smile of contentment on his face.
