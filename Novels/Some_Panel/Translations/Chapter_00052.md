# Chapter 52: The Path of the Sword Immortal

"We are fated by this sword art recording. Do you know the origin of this sword art?" Sword Yuanzi slowly asked, looking up.

"Disciple does not know!" Yang Ji composed himself and replied, "Master, does this sword art have some special origin?"

"This sword art comes from the Boundless Dao Sect of the Cultivation Continent. I personally brought it back. Unfortunately, only the first four forms of the sword dao are present." Sword Yuanzi smiled faintly, a rare hint of self-satisfaction appearing between his brows, yet tinged with a touch of regret.

"Master brought it back from the Boundless Dao Sect? Is Master a disciple of the Dao Sect?" Yang Ji's pupils slightly widened, a hint of surprise in his expression.

"I used to be half a disciple; I'm not anymore," Sword Yuanzi said, shaking his head.

He then calmly smoothed his robes with a faint smile before slowly continuing, "I once obtained a slot to go to the Dao Sect, but in the end, I was sent back to the Azure Waves Sect because I wasn't outstanding enough."

"Master, you possess peak-grade root bones and superior talent! Is that not considered outstanding?"

Yang Ji couldn't help but feel indignant for his master, frowning, "Could it be that the Boundless Dao Sect is full of spirit bodies with innate root bones?"

Sword Yuanzi, however, smiled kindly, saying, "Indeed, there are quite a few spirit bodies and saint bodies in the Boundless Dao Sect. Dao bodies, naturally close to the Great Dao, are also not uncommon. There are even Immortal bodies born with a trace of Great Dao laws. These are the true chosen ones, favored by heaven, making even me envious."

"So many geniuses in the Boundless Dao Sect?" Yang Ji was truly surprised.

"Indeed, there are too many geniuses. But if you understand that the Boundless Dao Sect is one of the ten most powerful Dao Sects in our cultivation world, then you'll grasp why there are so many geniuses there. The Boundless Dao Sect gathers nearly one-tenth of all the geniuses in this cultivation world; how could there not be many?"

Sword Yuanzi smiled calmly, "Compared to them, I truly have a significant gap."

"As the saying goes, a dragon begets a dragon, a phoenix begets a phoenix. When strong cultivators combine, their offspring are born as spirit seeds, saint seeds, dao seeds, or even immortal seeds."

"This kind of foundation is almost impossible to break. The only possibility is for an immortal maiden, a Loose Immortal herself, to be blind and commit herself to you. Then, the descendants born would be at least saint seeds."

"But such stories of immortal maidens and mortals only exist in legends. Disciple, I'm afraid you won't have a chance. Although you are quite handsome, it's unlikely any immortal maiden with heaven-shattering cultivation would be taken by your looks."

"However, one must always have aspirations. What if it actually happens? Then the descendants born would be the future hope of our Azure Waves Sect!"

"Master, you...!" Yang Ji couldn't help but laugh. He hadn't expected his composed master to have such a humorous side.

"Disciple, remember, sometimes relying on a powerful patron is also a skill," Sword Yuanzi said with a faint smile, utterly serious.

Yang Ji nodded with a wry smile, still somewhat puzzled, and asked, "Master, could it be that there are no disciples with talents below peak-grade root bones in the Boundless Dao Sect?"

Sword Yuanzi slowly replied, "Of course there are."

"Within the Boundless Dao Sect's own territory, disciples with superior or even mid-grade root bones can easily join the sect. The sect's requirements for them are not too high."

"However, for those of us from outside their territory, the requirements are very strict."

"Unless you are exceptionally outstanding and stand out from the crowd, otherwise, ordinary people like me, who fail the sect's assessment, will be sent back to our original sects."

Yang Ji frowned slightly, "Could it be that Master's peak-grade root bones are still inferior to those mid-grade root bones within their territory?"

Sword Yuanzi laughed freely, "On the path of cultivation, forty percent relies on skill, thirty percent on fortuitous encounters, and the remaining thirty percent on human connections and social dynamics."

"Of these three, Master seems to lack in all."

"As for those within their territory, proximity breeds familiarity, allowing them to remain in the Dao Sect with lower assessment requirements."

"Your Uncle-Master Ling Gu should have told you that a sect's strength isn't built on numbers, but on its top cultivators."

"Geniuses in the Boundless Dao Sect are treasured existences; they are the future backbone of the Dao Sect."

"As for mediocre cultivators like me, neither exceptional nor utterly useless, we are the most numerous and most inconspicuous in the Dao Sect, and face the fiercest competition."

"I am ashamed. I lost in the fierce competition with my fellow disciples and was unable to remain in the Dao Sect."

"However, people like us are not completely abandoned by the Dao Sect. For every genius we send to the Dao Sect, they bestow generous rewards such as pills, magic artifacts, and so on."

"It can be said that this is a large part of what maintains the strength of our Azure Waves Sect. All the great divine abilities within our sect were bestowed by the Dao Sect; we have benefited immensely."

Sword Yuanzi paused, then continued, "Chang Xiao also possesses peak-grade root bones like me, but his comprehension is far superior to mine."

"If he goes to the Dao Sect and displays sufficiently outstanding comprehension talent, the Dao Sect will bestow upon him spiritual items to enhance his root bones. For him to achieve a Post-natal Spirit Body would not be a pipe dream."

"If he can remain in the Dao Sect permanently, then our Azure Waves Sect will receive rewards from the Dao Sect every year, bringing immense benefits. This is also one of the reasons why the entire sect is wholeheartedly nurturing Chang Xiao."

"Similarly, Disciple, the comprehension talent you've displayed is equally outstanding. If you can join the Dao Sect and establish a firm foothold, then our Azure Waves Sect will truly turn over a new leaf."

"For you personally, the benefits will also be immense."

"Because the Dao Sect is simply too powerful. It possesses Immortal artifacts that can alter the flow of time, allowing for rapid cultivation of various spirit herbs. Its resources are endless: Nine Revolutions Golden Pills, Enlightenment Pills, Immortal Ascension Pills, Nascent Soul Pills—they have everything imaginable."

"Furthermore, the Immortal artifacts can draw in immortal qi from the Immortal Realm, refining it into Immortal Essence Pills. As long as you are outstanding enough, they can overwhelm you with so many Immortal Essence Pills you won't even know what to do."

"..." Yang Ji listened silently, his heart greatly shaken. This Dao Sect was truly too powerful.

As expected, only such a powerful sect could produce Immortals.

Immediately, he asked with longing, "Master, how can one join the Dao Sect? And how can one gain importance there?"

Sword Yuanzi replied, "First, look at cultivation. Second, look at comprehension. For cultivation, the most direct indicator is root bones, because good root bones mean rapid cultivation in the early stages. For comprehension, the most direct indicator is spell arts. If you are exceptionally gifted, you can achieve mastery in spell arts very quickly."

"Of course, in my opinion, nothing is more shocking than you, with your inferior root bones, defeating a spirit body."

"You are merely an individual with inferior root bones; who would know your comprehension is good? Therefore, you can only use the sword in your hand to carve out a path as an unparalleled genius."

"Back then, I knew that with my peak-grade root bone aptitude, it would be difficult to truly excel in cultivation. Thus, I embarked on the path of the Sword Immortal, hoping to carve out an immortal path with the sword in my hand and the sword arts I wielded. Unfortunately, I failed."

"But the comprehension you've displayed, Disciple, has shown me a glimmer of hope. I hope you will walk the path of the Sword Immortal in the future."

"The path of the Sword Immortal, where one is invincible among peers and can even battle cultivators of higher realms, relies on your exceptional comprehension of spell arts and the explosive combat power you unleash."

"Of course, cultivation is equally important. I will do my best to help you raise your cultivation."

"The moment you step into the Dao Sect, I hope you stand tall like a sword, unyielding!"
