# Chapter 6: Epiphany?

Chen Daoxuan naturally had no way of knowing that his thirteenth uncle, who had just been lamenting the family's poverty, was now counting piles of spirit stones in a treasure-filled secret chamber.

Back in his cave abode, Chen Daoxuan removed the stone slab covering the spirit vein. Immediately, spiritual energy began bubbling forth once more. Not daring to waste a single moment, he quickly activated the *Origin Return Technique*, drawing the spiritual energy into his body for refinement.

In the Myriad Stars Sea cultivation world, spiritual roots were classified into four grades based on a cultivator's efficiency in refining spiritual energy: Inferior, Medium, Superior, and the exceptionally rare Heavenly Spiritual Root.

Generally speaking, cultivators with Inferior spiritual roots could only refine one part out of ten units of absorbed spiritual energy, making their cultivation painfully slow under equal resource conditions. Medium spiritual root cultivators fared better, with twice the efficiency—refining two parts out of ten. Superior spiritual root cultivators doubled that again, refining four parts. The most astonishing were those with Heavenly Spiritual Roots, who could fully refine all absorbed spiritual energy, making their cultivation speed ten times faster than Inferior root cultivators under the same conditions.

As for Chen Daoxuan... he wasn't entirely sure what grade his spiritual roots belonged to. The Chen Family of Twin Lakes Island lacked the tools to accurately measure spiritual roots, so family cultivators could only vaguely estimate their grade based on personal refinement speeds. Without precise standards, the accuracy of such judgments was questionable.

According to Family Head Chen Xianhe, his own spiritual roots were of the Inferior grade. This explained why, despite beginning cultivation at age ten, he had only reached the sixth level of Qi Refining after eighty long years. While limited family resources played a role, the primary reason was his genuinely poor aptitude.

In contrast, Chen Daoxuan's cultivation speed was remarkably faster—reaching the third level of Qi Refining in just five years. At this rate, he would likely surpass Chen Xianhe's sixth level within a decade. Compared to Chen Xianhe's eighty-year struggle, Chen Daoxuan's progress was over four times faster. If Chen Xianhe's roots were Inferior, then Chen Daoxuan's must be at least Superior grade—placing him among the elite, second only to the legendary Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivators.

Had he been born into a major cultivation clan instead of the minor Chen Family, such talent would have earned him the finest resources and training. This didn't even account for his extraordinary talent in artifact forging.

By dawn the next day, after a night of cultivation, Chen Daoxuan refined the last wisp of spiritual energy. Feeling the increasingly stable qi in his dantian, he nodded in satisfaction. Having just broken through to the third level of Qi Refining, stabilizing his foundation in a single night was excellent progress. At this rate, he estimated reaching the fourth level—marking entry into mid-stage Qi Refining—within three years. The power boost from advancing to the fourth level would far exceed that of the third level; the *Origin Return Technique* recorded at least a fifty percent increase in qi volume when progressing from early to mid-stage Qi Refining, compared to the mere twenty percent increase between second and third levels.

After sealing the spirit vein with the stone slab again, Chen Daoxuan fell into contemplation. Normally, he would recite the *Primordial Enlightenment Sutra* after morning cultivation. But now, as he observed the nine stardust motes orbiting the golden scripture in his consciousness sea, he hesitated.

These nine motes had appeared after nine consecutive days of reciting the sutra. Today would be the tenth—what changes might occur? Yet the *Primordial Enlightenment Sutra* was his greatest hidden card; abandoning it was unthinkable.

"So be it," he resolved. "Fortune and misfortune are inseparable. Since I cannot relinquish this opportunity, I must be prepared for its potential backlash."

With renewed determination, Chen Daoxuan closed his eyes and began reciting the sutra. Soon, an aura of enlightenment flowed through his consciousness, plunging him into a state of chaos where only his lips continued moving instinctively. 

When he reopened his eyes after the time it takes an incense stick to burn, a tenth stardust mote had joined the others in his consciousness sea.

"The tenth one," he murmured, frowning. "But this feels different."

The ten motes now exhibited a mutual attraction, threatening to merge unless he consciously prevented it. "You wish to become one?" he mused. "Then so be it."

Releasing his control, Chen Daoxuan allowed the motes to collide.

*Boom!* 

The impact first rendered his mind blank, then his consciousness seemed to elevate rapidly until he witnessed what appeared to be the birth of a universe. Countless fragments of knowledge—both from his fading memories of a past life and his current diligent studies—surged toward him like tidal waves. Among them was the *Origin Return Technique* he practiced daily.

As his consciousness touched upon the technique, profound realizations flooded his mind. "So this is how the *Origin Return Technique* should truly be cultivated! No wonder I always felt something was off—this method allows far greater absorption of spiritual energy..."

In mere moments, he grasped insights that had previously eluded him. "How is this possible? I feel... exponentially more perceptive. It's as if—"

"An epiphany!" 

He recalled descriptions from ancient family texts about this legendary state of enlightenment—something most cultivators never experienced in their entire lives. Yet here he was, achieving it through the collision of ten stardust motes. 

Overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of this revelation, Chen Daoxuan stood momentarily stunned by the heaven-defying opportunity that had fallen into his lap.
