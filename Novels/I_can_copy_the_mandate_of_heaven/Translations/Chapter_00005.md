Chapter 5: The Change of Fate

In front of the Li family's door stood an old locust tree, its branches stretching out like withered arms, casting a large shadow on the ground. Beneath the tree was a simple stone table where Li Zhiming's father, Li Chujiu, would often sit and take a sip of liquor after a day's work in the fields.

Li Zhiming ran wildly out of the house, passing by the locust tree, and down a slope that led to the family's three acres of land. Two acres were fertile, while the third, located on a mountain, was barren and only suitable for planting sweet potatoes and broad beans.

As a young boy, Li Zhiming didn't understand the intricacies of farming. The land had just been sown with wheat seeds, and the green shoots were just beginning to emerge. Li Chujiu and Li Ershiwu were busy digging drainage ditches to prevent the wheat from rotting in the event of heavy rainfall.

Li Zhiming ran down to the fields, his little legs moving as fast as they could. When he arrived, Li Chujiu and Li Ershiwu were sitting on a rock, catching their breath after carrying a heavy stone.

"Father, I've come to help with the farmwork!" Li Zhiming exclaimed.

Li Chujiu chuckled. "There's not much for you to do, little one."

Li Ershiwu, however, suggested, "Hey, little four, why don't you help me dig up those stones?"

Li Zhiming protested, "I'm big enough to do real work!"

Li Chujiu thought for a moment and then said, "Alright, little four, why don't you go plant some broad beans along the ridge? Make sure to put four seeds in each hole, no more, no less."

Li Zhiming nodded enthusiastically, and Li Chujiu and Li Ershiwu shared a laugh.

As Li Zhiming began his task, Li Chujiu and Li Ershiwu returned to their work, unaware that Li Zhiming was observing them with a special ability. Li Zhiming saw the words "Fate: Forty Years of Hardship" and "Farmer Level 4" appear above Li Chujiu's head, along with "Hunter Level 1" above Li Ershiwu's head.

Without hesitation, Li Zhiming copied Li Chujiu's "Farmer Level 4" ability, and suddenly, he felt a surge of knowledge and experience flood into his mind. As he did so, the words above his own head changed from "Fate: Fourteen Years of Early Death" to "Small Prosperous Farmer." The color of the text also changed from black to a light, almost white hue.

Li Zhiming was shocked and amazed by the change. He realized that his fate was not set in stone and that he had the power to change it.

Li Chujiu noticed Li Zhiming's stunned expression and teased him, "Hey, little one, what's wrong? Snap out of it!"

Li Zhiming returned to his task, planting broad beans with a newfound efficiency and skill. Li Chujiu and Li Ershiwu were amazed by his progress, and when they checked on him later, they were astonished by the quality of his work.

"Little four's done a great job," Li Ershiwu said, impressed.

Li Chujiu was even more surprised, "This is unbelievable! It's as if he's been doing this for years!"

Their conversation was interrupted by a playful scolding from Li Chujiu, who sent Li Ershiwu tumbling into a ditch.

As the day drew to a close, Li Zhiming continued to work, his newfound abilities guiding him as he planted the broad beans with precision and care.
