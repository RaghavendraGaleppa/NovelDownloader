# Chapter 14: The Dark Market

Pingyin County had a dark market, a fact Chen Fei only learned from Zeng Defang. He heard that its original location was not far outside Pingyin County's northern wall. Now, due to the refugees, the dark market had moved directly into Pingyin County. Chen Fei surmised that this dark market must have an official backing; otherwise, how could the county yamen allow it to operate so openly?

Under the cover of night, Chen Fei, wearing a bamboo hat and a mask to conceal his face, arrived at the dark market. Contrary to his expectations of a clandestine affair, this so-called dark market appeared quite lively. Aside from the absence of hawkers' cries, it wasn't much different from the night market within Pingyin County.

Chen Fei browsed leisurely, observing the strange and peculiar items displayed on the stalls. Many were things he had never seen or even heard of. Whenever he encountered such items, Chen Fei would silently stand behind, listening to the conversations of others, gathering information. Surprisingly, through such eavesdropping, Chen Fei actually gained quite a bit of useful intelligence.

After wandering and observing for a while, Chen Fei stopped before a particular stall. This stall displayed numerous secret manuals, yet oddly, very few people lingered there.

"Feel free to browse," the stall owner said. "However, these manuals are only partial copies. If you find one you like, we can then discuss the price. This old man will naturally produce the complete manual then."

Chen Fei felt a moment of realization. After all, his experience was still somewhat shallow. With cultivation manuals, even slight alterations to a few lines could go unnoticed by most people. If critical sections were changed, practitioners might even suffer qi deviation or become crippled, which was not uncommon. The more profound the technique, the truer this was. In contrast, basic cultivation methods had simple qi and blood circulation routes, so even if one made a mistake in practice, it wouldn't lead to major issues. Moreover, as a martial artist's cultivation increased, any problems within basic cultivation methods would become apparent at a glance. Just like Chen Fei now: although he was only in the Skin Tempering realm, he had cultivated several techniques to the Great Perfection stage. Upon reviewing the four manuals earlier, he hadn't found any issues; they all appeared directly usable for cultivation.

"What's the price for these four manuals?" Chen Fei asked.

"Two taels of silver per manual. How many do you want?"

"All of them," Chen Fei said, placing eight taels of silver on the stall.

The stall owner smiled, then retrieved the corresponding latter halves of the manuals from behind him and handed them to Chen Fei. Chen Fei quickly flipped through them, found no issues, and placed the four manuals into his bag.

"Oh, and I'd like a skill manual too, something a bit more advanced," Chen Fei added after a thought.

The stall owner, not to be outdone, calmly met Chen Fei's gaze, as if to say, *This is the price; what are you going to do about it?* Chen Fei nodded, put the manual down, and turned to leave. His money didn't just fall from the sky; he had only recently become a little more financially comfortable and needed to spend it carefully. Spending so much just for the sake of the system panel's experiments would be a complete waste.

"Hey, don't go! Name your price!" the stall owner's voice called from behind.

Chen Fei paused, considered for a moment, then said, "Three taels!"

"Alright, deal!"

The stall owner immediately agreed, seemingly afraid Chen Fei would change his mind. He promptly produced the other half of the manual and handed it to Chen Fei. Chen Fei was somewhat speechless; it seemed he had overbid even at three taels.
