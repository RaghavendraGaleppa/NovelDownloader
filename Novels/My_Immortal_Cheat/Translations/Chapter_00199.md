# Chapter 199: The Human Skin Book

The strange thing was that he didn't feel any pain. On the contrary, he felt a sense of comfort, a relaxed sensation throughout his body, as if breaking free from some restraint.

"Wutian, my Buddha!"

Suddenly, a Buddhist chant rang in his ears, followed by a withered palm pressing on his shoulder. Streaks of golden runes, like tadpoles, surged into Zhou Tian's body.

Then, the human skin, which had almost completely detached from him, returned to Zhou Tian's body.

"Benefactor, you are truly bold, daring to approach this bloody source alone without waiting for your two companions."

Zhou Tian turned his head. It was a familiar face—that bald donkey Puzhi.

"Master Pu Zhi... Ah, Master, what a coincidence, you're here too."

Zhou Tian chuckled.

"Benefactor has a truly strong heart. Just now, you almost stepped into a place of eternal damnation."

Puzhi, his face full of wrinkles, spoke with a benevolent smile.

"Only by treading the line between danger and death can one temper oneself. I am no flower in a greenhouse!"

Zhou Tian's eyes were deep, showing no regard for his own life.

"Benefactor's awakening is truly profound. With such a mind, in a few years, the Star Realm will surely have a place for you. Perhaps you can even ascend to that unknown realm and become a leader on the path of cultivation."

Puzhi sighed, his face serious.

Zhou Tian awkwardly chuckled. "You're praising me too much," he thought, quickly changing the subject.

"Master Puzhi, do you know what this bloody river source truly is?"

"This thing..."

Puzhi's eyes were deep, as if lost in some memory. After a moment, he said, "It's what you call the Forbidden Treasure. Those young people from Bianyu came for it."

Zhou Tian raised an eyebrow. Indeed, this thing was the so-called Forbidden Treasure.

"Master, please don't misunderstand. We are merely feigning compliance with the people from Bianyu; we never intended to cooperate with them. Since you are Master Wutian's disciple, you must have a backup plan. How about we join forces and take him down? What do you think?"

Zhou Tian unhesitatingly sold out Huang Qi.

"Benefactor, it is you who should not misunderstand. I have no objection to him taking this item. In fact, I will even help him."

Puzhi shook his head and chuckled upon hearing Zhou Tian's words.

"Why? Isn't this Master Wutian's item?"

Zhou Tian asked, a little surprised.

"That's right. My master acquired this item when he was young. It is indeed an unimaginably heaven-defying treasure, possessing various mighty powers. With the help of this treasure, my master was able to rise so quickly."

Puzhi slowly explained.

"But after my master's passing, no one could control this item. It turned the entire ancient city into this state. The human skins and flesh of those who once fought alongside my master were separated, unable to rest in peace. This is something my master did not wish to see."

Puzhi seemed somewhat guilty, feeling remorseful that he couldn't let these people rest in peace.

Zhou Tian's heart stirred, confirming his conjecture: those human skins were indeed created by this item.

"Master Puzhi, could you tell me what exactly this item is?"

Zhou Tian asked.

"It has come to this day; there's no harm in telling you."

Puzhi calmed his mind and began, "What this thing is truly called, I don't know, nor did my master. I only know that my master called it the Human Skin Book."

Human Skin Book? Such a commonplace name? Zhou Tian couldn't help but inwardly complain, thinking it sounded like a prop from a domestic horror movie in his past life.

"My master once said that it was made from the skin of a certain creature, but he couldn't ascertain what kind of creature it was."

"The Human Skin Book has an astonishing function: molting!"

"Molting?"

Zhou Tian had a strange look on his face.

"That's right, but the molting I speak of is not the kind you just experienced, but a transformation."

"From the beginning of cultivation, the owner of the Human Skin Book can transform once at each realm. Each transformation changes your aptitude and physique, and can even bring forth various special physiques. When my master reached the Celestial Venerable realm, his transformation resulted in the Lapis Lazuli Buddha Body."

Zhou Tian was startled. This was indeed an extremely powerful function, capable of transforming into various innate physiques acquired later in life—truly unheard of.

Accumulating over time, one's physique and aptitude would surely reach an unimaginably high level.

"Moreover, the molted forms that are shed can also fight. Each time my master's cultivation advanced, they would also advance."

Hiss.

Zhou Tian gasped, "Good heavens, they can even cultivate and fight alongside you? That's too powerful!"

"And if my master faced mortal danger, they could even act as substitutes for death," Puzhi added.

Zhou Tian was speechless. As expected of a Forbidden Treasure, it was unbelievably powerful. He now even suspected whether his own immortal system had originated from Bianyu, though it was just a fleeting thought.

"These are all things my master once mentioned. There should be other functions, but I am unaware of them," Puzhi concluded.

Zhou Tian nodded. There certainly must be other functions. At the very least, what Saint Demon said about balancing Wutian's two personalities should be one of them.

At the same time, a thought appeared in Zhou Tian's mind: A Forbidden Treasure from Bianyu is already this powerful, so how strong is Bianyu itself? And such a powerful Bianyu is only ranked third. How strong are the first and second ranked forces? The waters of this Star Realm are truly terrifyingly deep.

"While the Human Skin Book is strong, its side effects are also obvious. Although the molted forms can help my master, they also have their own consciousness, and are quite sinister. If my master hadn't been born with one soul and two personalities, he might not have been able to suppress them and could have suffered a backlash and died."

"And without anyone controlling it, the Human Skin Book is like this now, leaving everyone in the entire city unable to rest in peace."

Puzhi pointed to the mighty bloody river flowing before them.

"Therefore, I will not stop you from taking it away. In fact, I will even help you. The only question is whether you can truly take it."

Speaking of this, Puzhi sighed, looking pained and resentful.

"Master, why do you say that?"

Zhou Tian asked, a little strangely. Could Wutian have left some incredible trump card?

"My master, rising from the lowest ranks and cultivating to the Celestial Venerable realm, shed a total of eleven molted forms. During this time, he went through various dangers. By the time of the great battle with Bianyu, five remained. Two were destroyed in the battle, so three are currently left."

Zhou Tian suddenly understood, realizing what the 'Wutian's molted forms' that Saint Demon had obtained were—they must have been the damaged molted forms.

Puzhi continued, "Those three molted forms are currently in this very place. Due to the Human Skin Book's characteristics, they each possess their own consciousness and did not perish with my master's passing. At this moment, summoned by the Human Skin Book, they should have already revived and are heading here."
