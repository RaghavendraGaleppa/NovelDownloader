# Chapter 172: The Crimson-Eyed Golden Roc

"Hey! That Ge Qingshen fellow—your granddaddy's waiting for you at the Dueling Immortal Platform! Haha, let's see how much weight this so-called 'strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Taiyi Dao Sect' really carries!"

With a wildly arrogant laugh, the crimson-eyed man turned and strode away, his figure gradually disappearing from view.

Clearly, he had already gone to the Dueling Immortal Platform to await Ge Qingshen.

Back at the scene, sensing the arrogance in the crimson-eyed man's words, Ge Qingshen's eyes flickered uncertainly as if hesitating.

Beside him, the Ji-clan disciple from the Human Emperor Court looked up, his gaze subtly urging Ge Qingshen forward. "Brother Ge, there's no backing out now. What are you waiting for? Don't disgrace our human race!"

No sooner had he spoken than Qu Junhou added fuel to the fire: "Senior Brother Ge, don't forget—you represent our Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect now! If you don't go, wouldn't that make our sect—and even our entire human faction—look weak before that bastard and the Myriad Spirit Alliance?"

As he spoke, Qu Junhou couldn't help glancing at Zhang Jing, who stood nearby with an air of complete detachment. A hint of admiration flashed through his eyes. "Brother Zhang really knows how to play this game," he mused silently.

Meanwhile, seeing Ge Qingshen's continued hesitation, the Wang-clan disciple from the Primordial Demon Sect stepped forward with a strange smile. "Brother Ge, go with confidence. Should you fall, I'll naturally step in." His voice brimmed with arrogance and self-assurance.

"Don't underestimate him, brother," warned the Shi-clan disciple from the Zhou Tian Star Palace, his expression grave. "That creature is from the Crimson-Eyed Golden Roc lineage of the Myriad Spirit Alliance—born with an innate affinity for the Metal Dao. His strength is terrifying. He once dominated the First Arena, effortlessly defeating even a Nascent Soul senior brother from our Star Palace. You mustn't take him lightly!"

Ge Qingshen's gaze sharpened. He knew full well he had no choice—whether he wanted to or not, he had to go.

"I'd hoped to save my trump cards for the secret realm's Foundation Establishment ranking battles," he thought bitterly. "Now it seems I'll have to reveal them prematurely... What a mess!"

His eyes turned cold as he glared at Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou. "Junior Brothers Zhang and Qu," he said icily, "after I defeat that beast, I might as well test your skills on the Dueling Immortal Platform too."

"Gentlemen, let us proceed to the platform," Ge Qingshen said with forced calm to the three disciples he'd invited. "Watch how I teach that arrogant Golden Roc a lesson."

"Excellent!"
"Haha, I look forward to seeing Brother Ge's prowess!"

With that, the four turned and left the hall.

Left behind, Zhang Jing, Qu Junhou, and two other Nascent Soul disciples exchanged glances before following suit.

Below, the assembled disciples looked around in confusion. "Senior Brother Shen, what about the Dao Tea Gathering...?" one asked hesitantly.

Shen Chu snorted. "With all the senior brothers gone to the dueling platform, what's the point? Let's go watch the show." Though his tone was gruff, inwardly he felt relieved—the gathering's abrupt end wasn't such a bad outcome after all.

Within moments, the once-bustling hall stood empty and silent.

Across Jade Cloud City, excitement began to build. Whether through deliberate leaks or natural gossip, news of the impending duel between the Myriad Spirit prodigy and Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect's elite spread like wildfire.

Within fifteen minutes, nearly every cultivator in the city had dropped their affairs to rush toward the Dueling Immortal Platform, fearing they might miss the spectacle. The clash between top talents—especially one representing humanity against the Myriad Spirits, with one side being the legendary Taiyi sect's strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator—was an opportunity none wanted to miss.

Soon, tens of thousands packed the platform's surroundings, their gazes fixed on the two figures locked in fierce combat. Gasps and exclamations rose continuously as terrifying waves of mana and profound Dao intent radiated from the dark immortal-metal platform.

---

Gone was Ge Qingshen's initial composure—his face now showed clear strain. "Damn it, this Golden Roc is tougher than expected," he thought desperately. "Those golden feathers seem impervious to all techniques. I can't keep this up."

Opposite him, the golden figure—now transformed into a massive, crimson-eyed roc—moved effortlessly through the barrage of spells. With each beat of its wings, countless golden blades materialized, slicing through the air with terrifying sharpness.

---

On a nearby observation platform, the Nascent Soul disciples watched intently—all except Zhang Jing, who sat with eyes closed, seemingly indifferent.

Noticing this, Qu Junhou sent a mental message: "Brother Zhang, aren't you going to watch?"

"No need," Zhang Jing replied without opening his eyes. "Ge Qingshen will lose—he's no match for that Golden Roc."

"How can you be so sure? He hasn't even used his hidden cards yet—he's prepared a century for this!"

"Just a feeling," Zhang Jing smiled faintly. Then, more seriously: "After he falls, one of us will need to step in. I only pushed him forward to humble his arrogance, but we can't let a Myriad Spirit creature walk away victorious."

His gaze flickered toward the Primordial Demon Sect disciple. "And it wouldn't look good if a Demon Sect member had to clean up a Taiyi disciple's failure."

---

"I understand," Qu Junhou nodded. Suddenly, a surprised voice echoed in his mind—his master's remnant consciousness. "Remarkable insight! To discern the outcome so early—this boy is extraordinary."

"You agree Ge Qingshen will lose?" Qu Junhou asked, startled.

"Absolutely," the voice said gravely. "The gap is clear. In this, you're far behind Zhang Jing." With unusual earnestness, the voice continued: "Cultivate his friendship, disciple. If he survives, that boy may reach Golden Immortal heights. He could be your greatest ally on the Dao path."

---

BOOM! 

A thunderous impact sent Ge Qingshen flying off the platform, carving a deep trench into the ground. When he staggered up, his robes were in tatters, his aura feeble. His face was ashen, eyes vacant with shock.

He had lost. Even with all his preparations, all his trump cards... How?

As he stared at the now-humanoid Golden Roc still standing victorious, genuine fear flickered across his face. The creature's power seemed to transcend normal Foundation Establishment limits.

With a defeated sigh, Ge Qingshen admitted the bitter truth: it wasn't that he was weak—it was simply that human Foundation Establishment cultivators couldn't compare to the Myriad Spirits' elite races.
