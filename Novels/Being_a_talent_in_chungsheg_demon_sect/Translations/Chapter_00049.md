# Chapter 49: Not an Ounce of Autonomy

“It seems the Foundation Establishment True Man behind the scenes has finally given up!”

Lu Yang looked up at the sky. It was only because he possessed the Primordial Chaos One Qi Divine Talisman and had experience from several lifetimes that he could vaguely perceive the changes in fate. This feeling of his Dao Heart becoming clear and the world opening up before him was something he hadn't experienced in a very long time.

“Good, good!”

Upon realizing the Foundation Establishment True Man was no longer plotting against him, Lu Yang instantly felt much more relaxed. What pleased him even more was that his other project was also progressing well.

Lu Yang took out the Innate One Qi Ten Thousand Souls Banner, then summoned his Innate One Qi Avatar. The Ten Thousand Souls Banner was very special. Although it contained a mustard seed space within, only things related to the Innate Dao Scripture, such as the Innate One Qi Avatar, could enter it.

As the avatar entered, Lu Yang felt his vision blur for a moment. The next second, a vast and boundless scroll slowly unfolded before Lu Yang's eyes. It was like a series of interconnected paintings, with each featuring a Banner Spirit. These paintings each had their own unique charm. Some depicted landscapes with human dwellings, some were isolated islands overseas, some were imperial palaces and forbidden cities, and some were celestial palaces in the Heavenly Court. In each of these paintings, a lively Banner Spirit was moving about, either indulging in food, drink, and entertainment, or meditating and cultivating. They looked just like real people.

Although he had seen it many times before, each time Lu Yang couldn't help but exclaim: “These paintings are probably formed from the Banner Spirits' memories from their former lives. By letting the Banner Spirits live within the paintings, it maintains their consciousness and memories from dissipating. What a powerful magic treasure!”

With a thought from Lu Yang, the scene within the paintings instantly changed. All the Banner Spirits were gathered in one place, and the original scenes of landscapes and human dwellings transformed into a massive factory and an assembly line.

At first, the Banner Spirits were still somewhat dazed. However, soon, as the strongest among the Banner Spirits, Liu Xin was the first to regain clarity. He quickly stepped forward to Lu Yang and respectfully said, “Your subordinate greets master.”

“How is the work progressing?”

“Reporting to master, we have already produced one hundred thirty-two Golden Light Talismans, one hundred fifty-three Five Thunder Talismans, and two hundred ten Sword Qi Talismans. Please inspect them, master.”

As his words fell, Liu Xin picked up a thick stack of talismans and presented them.

“Well done, but...”

Lu Yang's spiritual sense swept over them, and he contentedly put away the talismans. But soon, a stern look crossed his face: “...Who allowed you to let them rest?”

Ever since he had exchanged talisman techniques with Fairy Feixia, he had entrusted the production of three low-grade talismans to the Banner Spirits within the Ten Thousand Souls Banner. Therefore, the Banner Spirits should have been drawing talismans for him day and night, year-round, without rest. Yet, when he had just come in to inspect, he found everyone resting.

How could this be tolerated? They're defying heaven! As a Banner Spirit, if you dare to rest today, I can't even imagine what you'll dare to do tomorrow! This unhealthy trend must be nipped in the bud!

Thinking this, Lu Yang's eyes narrowed slightly, and he said in a deep voice: “Senior Brother Liu, I'm very pleased that you can organize the Banner Spirits to draw so many talismans, but I'm very displeased that you let them all rest.”

“Reporting to master, this subordinate had no choice but to do so.” Hearing this, Liu Xin quickly explained: “The art of drawing talismans requires living people to use their magical power as a brush and their spiritual wisdom as ink. However, Banner Spirits are essentially dead, though appearing alive.”

“While they possess magical power, their spiritual wisdom diminishes with each use.”

“If they draw talismans for a long time without allowing them to sleep and recuperate, they will eventually exhaust all their spiritual wisdom and ultimately dissipate for no reason.”

“So what?” Lu Yang's response made Liu Xin momentarily stunned.

“The Ten Thousand Souls Banner has no shortage of Banner Spirits. If they get so tired they dissipate for no reason, that's fine. I'll just get a new one to replace them, which will be more efficient.”

“Oh, right, the dissipated Banner Spirits can also be used to feed other Banner Spirits.”

“Since Banner Spirits can endure hardship, then they can endure even more hardship.”

“You Banner Spirits were born to work for me. Banner Spirits who cannot work for me have no value in existence, so let them dissipate on their own.”

Lu Yang spoke in a calm tone, but Liu Xin listened with trepidation.

‘Monster... what a monster!’

Looking at Lu Yang's use of the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, Liu Xin felt like he was practically a saint, as he had only summoned the Banner Spirits during combat in the past.

Lu Yang keenly noticed his emotions and smiled gently: “Senior Brother Liu, I believe you also understand how fierce the competition among Banner Spirits is now. To be honest, if it weren't for the bit of fellow disciple camaraderie between us, I wouldn't let you be solely responsible for this matter. You should learn to be grateful.”

“Otherwise, think about it: I could use this Banner Spirit, or that one. Why would I use you?”

“Isn't it because we're fellow disciples? And I owe my current success to you. Don't worry, as long as you work hard, I definitely won't treat you unfairly.”

Liu Xin: “...”

While Lu Yang was inspecting the work within the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, in another secret chamber of the Blood-Clothed Tower, Yun Miaoqing was currently embroiled in a fierce internal struggle.

“How could this be?”

Her expression was a mix of joy and shock, difficult to discern, and around her neck, the token symbolizing her identity as a disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion was emitting light. This was a communication spiritual light! As long as one circulated magical power to touch it, they could communicate with the person on the other side of the spiritual light. However, she had never imagined her token had this function! But why had no one ever contacted her before?

The next second, Yun Miaoqing heard a familiar voice sound in her ear: “Miaoqing? Very good, you're not dead. It seems you still have some destiny left.”

“You are... Sister!?”

Yun Miaoqing's beautiful eyes widened, revealing a look of astonishment. The reason she had previously extended an olive branch to Lu Yang was partly because she recognized Lu Yang's character, and partly because she had full confidence in her own background. As long as Lu Yang was willing to mend his ways and return to righteousness, she could get the Sword Pavilion to accept him. Because the Yun family, to which she belonged, had once produced a Sword Pavilion Headmaster, a Golden Core True Monarch. Although they were now in decline, they were still a major immortal clan within the Sword Pavilion.

However, she herself was not highly regarded by the family. The one truly valued was her elder sister—Yun Miaozhen, a True Disciple of the Sword Pavilion. She cultivated the Taiyi Jinhua Elixir Scripture, devoting herself to arduous cultivation, even refusing to take elixirs to hasten her growth. She was also one of the very few True Disciples who had cultivated great divine abilities even in the late Qi Refining stage. To describe her as a 'Heavenly Daughter' would not be an exaggeration in the slightest. Yun Miaoqing and Yun Miaozhen, although their names differed by only one character and they were biological sisters, their talents and abilities were as different as heaven and earth.

“Where are you now?” The spiritual light shimmered brightly, and a cold voice emerged from it: “You were born with insufficient destiny, which is why you suffered the misfortune of falling into the demonic sect. Now that it's complete, you should emerge from this tribulation.”

She could return to the Sword Pavilion?

Yun Miaoqing was briefly stunned, then boundless joy surged within her. She quickly said, “I'm in the Blood-Clothed Tower at Skull Mountain Market. Sister, are you coming to pick me up?”

“Blood-Clothed Tower?” Yun Miaozhen paused slightly, then said: “Have you been taken advantage of by that Blood-Clothed Tower Master? No matter, I'll cut him down for you, and that will count as your merits being fulfilled.”

As these words came out, Yun Miaoqing was instantly stunned. She quickly said, “Sister, you've misunderstood. Although Daoist Brother Lu is from the Demonic Sect, he is not an evil person. On the contrary, his heart is inclined towards the righteous path, and his talent is exceptional. I think instead of killing him, it would be better to persuade him to mend his ways and return to righteousness, which would also be a great help to the righteous path.”

Before Yun Miaoqing could finish speaking, a soft reprimand directly interrupted her.

“Absurd!”

The next second, outside Skull Mountain Market, a tall, imposing woman in a white robe and crane cloak, with sword light shimmering in her beautiful eyes and a heroic demeanor, suddenly crushed the jade talisman in her hand. Beside the woman, a middle-aged man frowned and asked, “What's wrong?”

“Miaoqing is beyond saving!” Yun Miaozhen shook her head and sighed: “She's pleading for a demonic fiend. I fear she's already deeply entangled in tribulation and cannot extricate herself. There's no hope of her escaping this tribulation anymore...”

“Then what does Junior Sister intend to do?”

“...To the Demonic Sect Market!”

As her words fell, a nameless anger suddenly surged within Yun Miaozhen's heart. Yun Miaoqing was her biological sister, and her appearance was seventy percent similar to hers. Thinking of this, Yun Miaozhen felt discomfort all over her body, and subconsciously drew her legs together. Immediately after, a flash of killing intent suddenly appeared on her delicate, pretty face: “That demonic fiend has bewitched my biological sister. If I don't personally cut him down, my thoughts will not be clear!”
