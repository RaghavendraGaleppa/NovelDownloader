**Chapter 5: A Roasted Chicken Settles the Dao Heart**

Practicing, Han Zhen completely lost track of time. He followed the chants of the True Yang Art, trying to capture the so-called "qi sensation." After about the time it takes an incense stick to burn, Master Wu lightly coughed. The other disciples woke up with confused looks, but a glint flashed in Han Zhen's eyes, though he kept silent. He chose to hide his progress in cultivating internal energy. Being too ostentatious would bring no benefit. Without understanding the Eight Extraordinary Meridians and the acupoints of the Cosmic Orbit, being able to sense true qi on his very first attempt was simply too unbelievable to reveal. Han Zhen planned to discreetly inquire after practice, asking the older disciples how long it took them to cultivate their first wisp of true qi. Then, he would choose an appropriate time to inform Master Wu, merely displaying the level of an average genius.

The "Heaven Rewards Diligence" Destiny played a far greater role in martial arts cultivation than Han Zhen had imagined. As long as he put in effort, he would definitely gain something. On his very first attempt following the internal energy chant, Han Zhen sensed a faint warm current appearing within his body. In the following days, Master Wu would answer Han Zhen and the other disciples' questions about internal energy cultivation in the mornings, and personally teach them practical martial arts knowledge in the afternoons. It wasn't until the third day that Master Wu, after inquiring about everyone's progress, announced he would be descending the mountain for a period. He arranged for a senior disciple, who had achieved success in cultivating true qi, to replace him in teaching Han Zhen and the others for the next month. Before leaving, he placed great hopes on Han Zhen's cultivation, specifically instructing him not to be lazy, and that he would return in a month to check on his internal energy progress. Only then did everyone realize that the Wild Wolf Gang seemed to be making big moves recently, with several deputy sect masters being dispatched to personally oversee different regions.

As Han Zhen walked along the rugged mountain path, he could sense the atmosphere within the Seven Mysteries Sect becoming noticeably tense from the hurried senior disciples he passed. Past conflicts had never escalated to such a scale, usually confined to minor skirmishes around the few towns bordering their territory. However, the life-and-death struggles outside had no direct bearing on their new generation of disciples. At least two years of cultivation were required before they would be sent out for experience, and only after gaining some martial world experience might they be dispatched to fight the Wild Wolf Gang. "I've just settled down. I hope no unforeseen changes occur." Han Zhen's face showed worry; he didn't want any accidents before acquiring the Evergreen Art.

Back in his dwelling, casting aside the external disturbances, Han Zhen continued cultivating internal energy to strengthen his true qi. Becoming stronger as quickly as possible was paramount. As for the Blinking Sword Art located in the Seven Absolutes Hall's martial arts library, Han Zhen didn't pay it much mind. His true qi cultivation was advancing a realm a day; there was no need to lose the watermelon over a sesame seed. Whether it was potentially plotting to acquire the spells from the Evergreen Art from Doctor Mo in the future, or facing the drastic changes in the Seven Mysteries Sect, all required the backing of strength.

It wasn't even certain if he could cultivate the Evergreen Art, so it wasn't worth staking everything on it. Furthermore, Han Zhen also found joy in cultivating internal energy. With every practice session, the "Heaven Rewards Diligence" Destiny would subtly take effect. This sensation of clearly feeling his true qi gradually growing stronger was utterly addictive to Han Zhen. It was like playing grind-heavy games in his previous life, repeatedly running the same dungeon, watching his character's stats slowly improve, completely engrossed and never tiring of it.

That night, as Han Zhen circulated the chants, the warm current within his body flowed through his limbs and bones, nourishing his physique. Just as he reached the ninth iteration, Han Zhen suddenly felt the wisps of warm current within his body merge into a cohesive whole. Several breaths later, a warm current, several times stronger than before, surged forth from within him, and the circulation of true qi in his body was no longer stagnant. "Could it be that the True Yang Art has reached foundational mastery?"

According to his senior disciples, the True Yang Art, as the Seven Mysteries Sect's foundational internal energy cultivation method, had five basic stages: Beginner, Foundational, Minor Accomplishment, Major Accomplishment, and Perfection. Only disciples who cultivated it to Minor Accomplishment, laying a solid foundation, would have the opportunity to switch to more profound martial arts, converting the True Yang Art's true qi into that of a higher-level martial art. With Master Wu absent, and the senior disciple assigned to teach them also dispatched today, Han Zhen didn't have to worry about his martial arts progress being discovered. As for Master Wu's inspection a month later, with a thirty-day window, demonstrating his cultivation success then wouldn't seem abrupt. After all, someone like Li Feiyu, who only had inferior root bones, relied on consuming pills to become a master capable of defeating senior disciples who had been cultivating for over a decade, all within just four years as a registered disciple. So, saying he achieved foundational mastery of the True Yang Art in half a month would also be quite reasonable, wouldn't it?

Meanwhile, the tense atmosphere within the Seven Mysteries Sect went completely unnoticed by Han Li, whose daily routine was simply a straight line between two points. More than ten days later, Han Li finally saw his cousin, Han Zhen, again. That day, after completing his daytime cultivation, Han Zhen went to the outer area of the hall where registered disciples learned basic martial arts. Before long, he waited for Han Li, whose classes had just finished. Many disciples from wealthy families, seeing Han Li jog over to Han Zhen, immediately became envious. Some who had vaguely bullied Han Li before were already considering how to apologize and make amends. Han Li was a bit unaccustomed to so many gazes on him, but he felt that his cousin Zhen, dressed in the Seven Absolutes Hall disciple's satin robe, looked truly imposing.

"Cousin Zhen, I've been taken in as a registered disciple by Doctor Mo." By a secluded pond, Han Li sat on a large rock, wolfing down the roasted chicken Han Zhen had brought. The treatment of registered disciples and those of the Seven Absolutes Hall were certainly incomparable. Han Li had no money, so he could only eat ordinary food in the cafeteria every day. Seeing wealthy disciples spend money like water always made him feel a bit uncomfortable.

Over ten days had passed, and Han Li's initial excitement about becoming a Seven Mysteries Sect disciple had worn off. He recounted his experiences and observations from these past days to Han Zhen. On the very day he was taken from Bone Refining Cliff, an old man who called himself Doctor Mo took him and Zhang Tie. The senior disciples all greatly respected Doctor Mo, so Han Li naturally didn't dare refuse. He now lived in a place called Divine Hand Valley within Mount Caixia. Seven Mysteries Sect disciples only went there when injured, so it was usually very quiet. However, Han Li's regret was that Doctor Mo, besides teaching them medical skills, would only teach them a set of health-preserving chants after Han Li learned to read, and would not teach any martial arts. To avoid being expelled from the mountain, he could only pass Doctor Mo's assessment of his health-preserving chant cultivation. As for wanting to learn martial arts, he would have to go to the instructors. Han Li wanted to be as imposing as his cousin Zhen, not practice some useless health-preserving exercises or foolishly stand there every day.

Han Zhen could sense from Han Li's tone that he was already considering going down the mountain, as he had never been away from his family for such a long time. He even gathered from Han Li's words that he wouldn't mind failing the assessment in half a year. After all, before this, his Third Uncle was already a person of great status and standing in his mind. Being able to live the kind of life his Third Uncle did, with his parents and little sister, would already be very satisfying.

After eating the entire roasted chicken, Han Li finally had some rich food in his stomach. He washed his hands and face, then asked, "Cousin Zhen, what do you think I should do?" Recalling how imposing his cousin Zhen looked when he came to find him today, Han Li's desire to simply live like his Third Uncle began to waver.

"Do you want to eat roasted chicken every day?" Han Zhen simply asked. Although his stomach was full, the thought of the roasted chicken's flavor made Han Li involuntarily swallow and lick his lips.

"Yes!"
