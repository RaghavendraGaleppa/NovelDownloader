# Chapter 23: Leaving the Manor to Collect Rent, Demons and Monsters Emerge

Li Xian frowned. "Jiang Yun is deliberately making things difficult and has no integrity at all. What exactly did she say when you went to see her?"

Zhao Han let out a soft sigh and said with resentment, "That Jiang Yun is indeed despicable, but... who told her to be so powerful? The way of the world is like this; we have to accept it. There's no other choice."

"We went to find Jiang Yun. At first, she deliberately refused to see us, forcing us to kowtow and bow her she she was she was suddenly she to she suddenly suddenly suddenly to to her, and suddenly suddenly suddenly suddenly suddenly suddenly suddenly, was was she were her tot to k to her her, she said the her her her to speak to us us k Jiang Jiang said she just / Jiang k k her " to her k k k ' she her her her her her her her her her her her Jiang her her her her her her her to k. her her her her her her her her asked said's ",. to k me " " Li was.. kow was.. was was was was was was, was was was,, " you, " she said, 'As long as the Tiger Blood Pill is offered, everything can be discussed.'"

Li Xian asked, "Is that really the case? Did she really say that?" His eyes were filled with scrutiny.

Although he had only met Jiang Yun twice, he knew that this woman was not someone easy to talk to.

"Ah." Zhao Han let out a soft sigh and took over the conversation, telling the truth: "Jiang Yun's exact words were, 'You three are quite amusing. First, have that Li Xian kneel and kowtow, and honestly offer the Tiger Blood Pill, then we'll discuss the rest.' That was roughly the meaning of the second brother's report."

"Jiang Yun didn't even give a promise, and you believed her?" Li Xian analyzed calmly: "Her words, 'we'll discuss the rest later,' clearly meant she intended to back out later. If you believed her, not only would the Tiger Blood Pill be lost, but you would also be humiliated for nothing."

Zhao Han clenched his teeth, punched the wall in frustration and helplessness. "I know that too, but there was no other way. I could only pray that Jiang Yun would show some mercy, take the Tiger Blood Pill, and let us go like passing gas."

"Fourth brother, don't worry. As long as you agree, we'll give you the next two months' salary. Consider it as us buying your Tiger Blood Pill."

"What would I want your salary for?" Li Xian gently shook his head. He patted the three men's shoulders to comfort them.

When one is desperate, one is prone to lose composure.

"If you trust me, just endure a little longer."

"To be honest with you, I went to see Commander Pang yesterday to ask about the way into the Leisure Martial Pavilion. Although I haven't gotten a reply yet, it's still better than pinning your hopes on Jiang Yun!"

Li Xian's voice was warm and sincere, trying his best to calm the three men.

However, the three men averted their gazes.

Suddenly, with a "thump," Wang Chun had already knelt down, pleading, "Fourth brother, we beg you, just take the Tiger Blood Pill and go see Jiang Yun!"

Li Xian was startled. He quickly grabbed Wang Chun's shoulder, secretly channeling his internal energy to help him up. "Second brother, let me tell you the truth. I've already taken the Tiger Blood Pill, so I can't see Jiang Yun even if I wanted to."

"What!?"

The three men were shocked in unison. Zhuo Yilie said, "Fourth brother, don't lie to us. I saw the bulge in your chest pocket just after midnight last night; the Tiger Blood Pill was still there."

"I took it this morning," Li Xian admitted frankly.

"This... this..."

Zhao Han and the other two looked at each other, at a loss for what to do.

Li Xian knew that saying more would be useless, but he still said solemnly, "Trust me."

Zhao Han and the others forced a smile, wanting to say more but holding back. They grew increasingly silent and eventually left, completely dejected.

From that point on, Zhao Han and the other three began to intentionally or unintentionally distance themselves from Li Xian.

The three men asked for leave for two consecutive days, which was already Pang Long's leniency. On the third day, they had to resume their usual schedule, training together in the morning and practicing martial arts.

The purplish-green palm prints on their faces were naturally impossible to hide anymore, attracting sneers and ridicule from the other guards. The three men felt utterly ashamed and were in a wretched state.

Li Xian saw it all, knowing that arguing was useless. He focused on strengthening his own strength, his punches becoming more resolute.

He would occasionally visit Pang Long's residence to inquire about the "Leisure Martial Pavilion."

Thanks to Pang Long's influence, Jiang Yun did not come to cause trouble.

In this way, three days passed in a flash. There was still no news, but his strength had improved tremendously.

Li Xian's skill [Running] had already reached Great Perfection. He could run like the wind, with incredible speed and stamina. He could easily traverse difficult terrain such as mountainous areas, forests, and swamps.

During the morning training runs, he could leave all the other guards far behind, giving him more time to practice his fists.

[Four Directions Fist]
[Proficiency: 715/1500, Small Success]

The internal energy in his Dantian was already the size of three fists. When internal energy flows, it can strengthen the spirit, invigorate the body, and dispel illness and cold.

Its uses are endless.

"It is said that for those who are highly skilled in martial arts, the uses of internal energy are even more varied and endless."

After finishing the morning training one day, Li Xian let out a soft breath of turbid air, feeling greatly rewarded.

"Guard Li Xian, number 269."

A call came from behind him. When he turned around, he saw seven people walking towards him. Among them were two familiar faces: Qiao Dashou and Zhao Dachun.

Zhao Dachun smiled and said, "Brother Li, your patrol duty for today has been canceled. We seem to have a fate to be assigned together again."

"Oh?" Li Xian asked, "Is there another mission?"

"We have to leave the manor to help the Madam collect rent," Zhao Dachun said, clearly familiar with these kinds of affairs.

When the guards of the Unity Manor had nothing to do, their main duty was patrolling. But at the end of every few months, most of the guards would go down to the various villages to collect rent.

"Our group of eight is going to the Longevity Village to collect rent. Pack up quickly. It's a long journey, so let's try to go and return early."

The one speaking was Feng Huo, a man in his thirties with a lean build. He was a C-rank guard and the temporary leader of the eight-man team.

"Alright," Li Xian said, wiping the sweat from his brow. He didn't have much to pack.

Before the eight of them left, they first went to the Canteen to get the food for the round trip. Each person took their own, trying to take as much as possible, otherwise, they would have to go hungry on the road if they ran out.

Li Xian ate as he took, filling his stomach. Then, he used his internal energy to flatten the steamed buns and dry pancakes, hiding them in the pockets inside his sleeves.

In these times, having extra food was always a good thing.

The weather was getting colder, and snow was already falling outside the manor. Li Xian thought to himself, "Although it's cold, I bought my little brother a new padded jacket last time. With my father's linen clothes, they shouldn't freeze."

The guards' uniforms were warm in winter and cool in summer. Plus, Li Xian had already cultivated internal energy, so his resistance to cold was far superior to that of ordinary people. He wasn't afraid of the snow.

"Damn it, it's so strange. It doesn't snow in the morning or evening, but it has to snow right when we're going on a long trip."

Feng Huo spat on the ground, impatiently brushing the snow off his shoulders. He said to everyone, "The Longevity Village is thirty li away from the manor, and it's all mountain roads. Be careful on the way."

"If this snow stops, that would be best. If it doesn't and instead gets heavier, don't say I didn't warn you. There are a lot of strange things out there!"

"If we run into bears, leopards, or tigers, that's still okay. We all have some martial arts skills to defend ourselves, so we won't be completely helpless. The thing to fear is... running into some supernatural weirdness. In all likelihood, we won't get out unscathed."

"Furthermore, if you get disoriented by a strange wind and lose your way in the snow, you'll be in a real fix, with no one to turn to for help."

Feng Huo warned.

He was mainly speaking to Li Xian. The others, upon seeing the snow, all had solemn expressions. It's unclear if they had any strange experiences, but they likely knew that mountain roads in the snow were extremely difficult to travel.

"The world is unstable; demons and monsters are emerging everywhere," Li Xian thought. Seeing everyone's solemn expressions, he didn't dare to be careless and took Feng Huo's warning to heart.
