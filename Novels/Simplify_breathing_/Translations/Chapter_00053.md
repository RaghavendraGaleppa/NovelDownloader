# Chapter 53: Night Cat

“They don't open during the day, only at night. What a peculiar habit…” Chen Fei couldn't help but grumble as he looked at the scene before him.

Yesterday, Chen Fei had specifically found an opportunity to ask Qian Jijiang where he bought those two candles. Qian Jijiang had pointed him to this very shop.

Chen Fei glanced around, sensed nothing unusual, and then stepped into the shop.

“Esteemed guest, what do you need?”

A hoarse voice spoke. Chen Fei turned and saw a person less than a meter tall, standing on a stool, smiling at him.

Chen Fei surveyed his surroundings. It looked no different from any ordinary shop, completely devoid of any sinister aura.

“I heard you sell things that counter eerie entities here?” Chen Fei looked at the shopkeeper, who showed no trace of a martial practitioner's aura, yet didn't seem entirely like a common person either, giving off a very strange feeling.

“The esteemed guest has come to the right place,” the shopkeeper said, pulling a red candle from under the counter and placing it before Chen Fei. “When you encounter an eerie entity, light this candle, and it can resist it. However, it's merely a deterrent. If the entity stays by your side, the candle will burn faster. Once it burns out, the entity will still kill.”

“How much?”

Chen Fei carefully examined the red candle, confirming it was identical to the one Qian Jijiang had used. Back in the mountain village, if not for that red candle, several people might have died.

A dark-red blade, thin and sleek, appeared on the counter. Its slender form suggested it would likely snap if it collided with other weapons; it seemed specifically designed to deal with eerie entities.

“What's the price?”

“Ten thousand taels of silver.”

“Please show me the next item.”

Chen Fei felt his teeth ache slightly. It wasn't that he couldn't accumulate that much money, but it would certainly take a considerable amount of time. To say the blade was useless would be wrong, as it could slay eerie entities. But to say it was useful, it could *only* be used to slay eerie entities.

The shopkeeper showed no impatience. A small medicinal bottle then appeared on the counter.

“Illusion-Breaking Water. Apply it to your eyes, and you can see through the illusions of eerie entities. One thousand taels of silver.”

Chen Fei looked at the bottle with some curiosity, reminded of the legendary "ox tears" from his past life, which were said to have the same effect. If he had this item two days ago, he wouldn't have had to worry about getting lost in the fog.

“Awakening Incense. Light it to dispel confounding mists. Three hundred taels.” A stick of incense, which Chen Fei had seen before, appeared on the counter.

“Do you have anything else?”

“No, only these.” The shopkeeper shook his head and asked Chen Fei, “Has the esteemed guest taken a liking to anything?”

However, for Chen Fei to sell pills to a shop at such prices, he was somewhat unwilling.

Aside from selling pills to a shop, there was another method: setting up his own stall for scattered sales.

Xingfen City had such streets specifically for rogue cultivators to sell various items. Chen Fei had visited them before, and the array of goods was indeed diverse. As for quality, that depended on one's own discernment.

Chen Fei could refine pills and then set up a stall there, but this would undoubtedly eat into his time.

His Shocking Swallow Art needed to be cultivated to Great Completion so that his cultivation could break through to the Bone Forging Realm as quickly as possible.

There was also the deduction of the Ever-Floating Pill formula. The partial recipe obtained from the Zhao family last time contained quite a lot of information. Chen Fei estimated that this deduction might be completed within a month at most.

Furthermore, there were bow arts. Archery techniques were scarce in Pingyin County, but in Xingfen City, there were many bow art manuals. Chen Fei was thinking of advancing his archery skills to a higher level.

All these tasks were extremely time-consuming for Chen Fei, and setting up a stall would be more loss than gain.

“I need to find someone to help me run the stall; I'll just need to share some of the profits.”
