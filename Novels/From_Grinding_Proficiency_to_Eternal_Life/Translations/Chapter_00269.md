# Chapter 269: Shock and Awe

Bi Sheng stared intently for a long while before speaking, his voice tinged with disbelief.

"Mercury-like marrow, jade bones that sing, sinews coiled like dragons, blood resembling molten gold, thunderous breath, pores hiding sharp edges, the Triple Burner nurturing swords, and a sea of marrow generating vital energy..."

The more Bi Sheng looked, the more alarmed he became. Just what kind of supreme arts had this young man cultivated to achieve such a profound state?

Not only was his physique as tough as refined steel, but his blood energy was also boiling like molten gold. The surging blood energy, not yet fully settled, condensed on the surface of his dragon-scale armor into crimson cloud patterns. With each breath, the armor plates shifted, faintly revealing the image of a flood dragon coiled around a mountain.

Bi Sheng's gaze was like lightning; he could see that the armor had already merged with Xu Yunfan's flesh and blood. The edges of the dragon-scale plates glimmered with a dark golden light, greedily absorbing its master's surging blood energy and feeding back an even sharper killing intent.

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane inserted behind him was also unwilling to remain silent. The red patterns on its body flickered with the rhythm of its master's blood energy, like a living creature breathing in and out the fire of the earth.

Bi Sheng was deeply moved. He clearly sensed a vicious aura dormant within the cane, echoing the newly born energy in Xu Yunfan's sea of marrow. This was the mutation resulting from his forcibly merging the *Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Art* and the *Triple Burner Sword Nurturing Art*.

Every inch of his muscle and bone hid a sharp edge, and his breath carried the sound of sword hums.

"How long has it been? Three years? Or two..."

Bi Sheng's fingers unconsciously dug into his palm, his back taut as a steel string beneath his Taoist robes.

He clearly remembered their first encounter in the 800-mile desolate plains. Back then, this小子 was just a crude martial artist who had perfected Skin Training. His stance was fierce, but he hadn't even touched the threshold of the Sinew and Bone Realm.

Bi Sheng had once mocked him for having bones as mixed and coarse as gravel, thinking that reaching the Sinew and Bone Realm in this lifetime would be a stroke of incredible luck. Who could have predicted that this piece of gravel, which he had declared would eventually be crushed into dust, had now been forged into meteoric iron capable of cleaving the heavens!

Marrow Cleansing Realm!

Bi Sheng's throat bobbed as if he had swallowed a burning hot coal.

This realm was a watershed in the martial path. Many true disciples of famous sects spent decades stuck at the Blood Exchange Gate, unable to advance an inch, yet the person before him had already forged the grand aura of a master—"Mercury-like marrow, jade bones that sing."

What was even more terrifying was the foundation that blended the *Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Art*, the *Triple Burner Sword Nurturing Art*, and the *Muscle and Bone Marrow Cleansing Technique*.

Xu Yunfan's expression was tense. The longer the old Taoist looked at him, the brighter his eyes became, and even the colorless altar seemed to brighten a few degrees.

His eyes quickly scanned the surroundings, confirming his escape route. The muscles throughout his body began to tense and relax in an imperceptible rhythm, keeping his blood energy in a state of readiness without the slightest sign of calming down.

He could fight opponents of a higher realm even when he was at the Blood Exchange stage. Now that he had entered the Marrow Cleansing Realm and possessed several top-tier martial arts, even if he couldn't defeat the old man, he should at least be able to retreat.

Beside him, Lin Qingxuan trembled at the sight of Bi Sheng's unblinking, almost predatory gaze. "M-Master, what's wrong?!"

Bi Sheng quickly snapped back to his senses, realizing he had lost his composure.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's slightly bristling demeanor, he couldn't help but chuckle, a hint of regret surfacing in his heart.

He blamed himself for being too lazy back then. Carrying an extra person while traveling by wind would have consumed an extra thirty percent of his true qi. If he had brought Xu Yunfan back with him back then, he would have surely received a huge surprise.

"Don't be nervous, Xu boy. You came out of that secret realm, didn't you?"

Bi Sheng stroked his beard with a smile, his withered, branch-like hand gesturing to show he meant no harm.

However, Xu Yunfan's back muscles tensed even more.

This old Taoist looked benevolent on the surface, but a needle-sharp scrutiny was hidden in the corners of his eyes.

His right hand hung naturally, his thumb and forefinger unconsciously rubbing together, but on the surface, he cupped his fists in a salute. "Your discerning eye is sharp, Senior. This junior was trapped in the secret realm for a long time. I happened to see a rift open to the south and took the liberty of闯ing out."

"Oh?" Bi Sheng's white eyebrows raised slightly. "Was there anything unusual near that exit?"

"Black clouds pressed down from above, the earth's veins churned, and the entire small world secret realm was covered in black cracks, as if it were about to collapse."

He absolutely could not reveal the blood sacrifice of the White Jade Palace at this moment. Otherwise, Bi Sheng would surely find a way to control him. After all, this was the主场 of the Taoist Sect. Although there was only Bi Sheng here for now, if he let out a shout, he could at least summon three Grand Elders.

The Taoist Sect's position among the Six Great Sects was not just because it was the leader of the Taoist path, but also because of its endurance and longevity.

Every Grand Elder of the Taoist Sect was a ninth-realm Qi Refining Grandmaster. Without exception, they had all endured the passage of years, refined their techniques, and only in their hundredth year had their劲力 transformed into qi, cultivating a wisp of true qi to achieve the ninth-realm Qi Refining.

Although Bi Sheng was not the Sect Master, he was extremely famous throughout the Great Zhou's martial world. He had diligently cultivated for two full sixty-year cycles and directly entered the ninth-realm Qi Refining. The moment he left the mountain gate, he had defeated the sect masters of two top-tier sects.

Thus, Xu Yunfan shifted the topic. "This junior fled in a hurry. I only vaguely saw the blood energy of many demons shatter, and a clear light shot towards the center of the secret realm."

As these words fell, Bi Sheng's expression tightened slightly.

At this moment, Lin Qingxuan also picked up the Xuantian Mirror from the ground and quickly walked up to Bi Sheng.

"Master, I just activated the Xuantian Mirror to reflect the secret realm. It seems the realm is mostly ruined."

Her expression was slightly excited.

"The mirror shows that the entire secret realm has begun to collapse, but the central position is being held by something."

At this point, Lin Qingxuan looked at Xu Yunfan with some annoyance, pouting. "I originally wanted to zoom in on the image to see, but he suddenly jumped out and interrupted me."

Xu Yunfan silently glanced at Lin Qingxuan. This girl was only about sixteen years old, yet she wielded the famous Xuantian Mirror. She was definitely not an ordinary person.

As a disciple of the Foundry Hall of the Heavenly Work Cave and possessing the Heavenly Work Forging Technique, Xu Yunfan had naturally heard of the Xuantian Mirror. It was very likely an eighth-rank divine weapon. When the Xuantian Mirror shines, it could easily melt flesh and bone under the reflection of sunlight and moonlight, but its greater use was for omens and divination.

It was also widely recognized in the current Great Zhou's martial world as the companion item of a Land Immortal from two thousand years ago.

For this young girl to freely control the Xuantian Mirror...

She must have been chosen by the mirror as its master.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan's eyes narrowed slightly. This girl might be even more important than the Taoist Sect's current heir apparent.

"Take it away quickly, quickly! This old man can't take it!"

As Lin Qingxuan brought the Xuantian Mirror before him, Bi Sheng waved his hand repeatedly and took several steps back.

He had suffered a great loss from it before and was naturally on guard.

Lin Qingxuan let out an "Oh," turned her head to look at Xu Yunfan, whose face was cold and expressionless, and pouted. She then ran to a nearby tea table with the Xuantian Mirror in her arms and sat down, pouring herself tea.

Just as Bi Sheng's knuckles were unconsciously tapping the long sword at his waist, a light laugh suddenly came from his side. "Since the small world has already shattered, the White Jade Palace, as an anchor, should be able to hold on for some time."

Xu Yunfan's muscles instantly tensed. The sound was less than ten meters away from him, yet it had appeared as quietly and suddenly as morning mist drifting over a bluestone path.

He turned his head sharply and saw a Taoist in a crane-feather robe with wide sleeves standing with his hands behind his back at the edge of the altar. Not a single speck of dust had been disturbed beneath his feet.
