# Chapter 30: Buying Pills and the Courtyard Guard Competition

“Have you been here before?”

Xiao Qing led the way, circling a long corridor before suddenly asking.

“It’s my first time,” Li Xian replied honestly.

“It seems you don’t know many of the rules,” Xiao Qing smiled. “I have some time today, so I might as well explain them to you.”

Li Xian said solemnly, “Thank you.”

It was certainly a good thing to have someone willing to point out these rules.

Xiao Qing waved her hand; she was simply helping because Li Xian was handsome and polite. Besides, she was bored and looking for someone to talk to. She began explaining the rules of the Idle Pill Pavilion, such as not touching the pills and not bargaining.

Some details were crucial; if one wasn’t careful, they might be forced to buy pills they didn’t want. Furthermore, not all pills in the Idle Pill Pavilion were effective. There were many failed or defective products with low efficacy but high toxicity.

If you didn’t want to buy such pills, you had to judge for yourself. After purchasing, you couldn’t come back to make a scene; otherwise, you would violate the estate rules and suffer a terrible fate.

“Generally speaking, a Grade D Guard can only purchase pills once every three months.”

“A Grade C Guard can purchase once a month. A Grade B Guard can purchase three times a month. A Grade A Guard can purchase five times a month.”

“You only have one chance to buy pills, so you must think it through carefully.”

She stopped in front of a wooden shelf holding many wooden boxes. The pills were inside, but the categories varied greatly.

“I see…” Li Xian hadn’t expected so many restrictions.

“Of course,” Xiao Qing reminded him, “if you have the ability, you can always find a way to buy a few more pills.”

“Oh?”

Li Xian was sharp and immediately understood the implication. The so-called “finding a way” meant entrusting Grade C or Grade B Guards to help purchase pills.

“So you’ve figured it out,” Xiao Qing said kindly. “That’s why you should build good relationships with other guards, especially those of a higher grade.”

A three-month interval for Grade D Guards was indeed too long. This meant that when Grade D Guards urgently needed pills, they had to委托 (entrust) Grade C Guards to buy them. Naturally, Grade C Guards would take a cut.

Thus, an interest chain was formed, allowing Grade C Guards to earn a few hundred extra coins per month.

Li Xian focused his attention on the shelf. There were over a hundred pills, with a wide variety of styles. Sometimes, even the same type of pill looked drastically different.

For example, Li Xian saw a “Deer Breath Pill.” One was pitch-black, emitting a faint foul odor, and was barely recognizable as a pill. The other was pale green, perfectly round, and faintly fragrant.

However, his intuition told him that the pitch-black Deer Breath Pill was closer to a finished product.

“Deer Breath Pill,” “Leopard Bone Pill,” “Deer Blood Pill,” “Ox-Rhinoceros Pill,” “Strength-Building Pill,” “Qi-Reverting Pill,” “Tendon-Fortifying Pill”...

These were the only pills available to Grade D Guards. They were the most basic pills, so their names and effects were straightforward.

Pills with the word “Beast” in their names were generally refined from wild animals. Their effects were limited to strengthening the body, fortifying bones, boosting energy, and replenishing essence.

“Strength-Building Pill: upon consumption, stimulates flesh and blood, strengthens strength.”

Li Xian carefully selected.

The “Tiger Blood Pill” he took last time belonged to Grade B pills and was rarely available even if one had the money. To buy another would be like a fool’s dream.

“I have one thousand five hundred coins. I should try to buy the most expensive one. Among them, the Leopard Bone Pill is the most expensive. Its effect is to toughen the periosteum, restore Qi and blood, and increase leg strength.”

Li Xian quickly narrowed down his options.

There were seven Leopard Bone Pills on the shelf, each with different color and texture. The rule was that one could only look from a distance and could not pick them up to inspect them. If one touched a pill, they had to buy it.

“Have you decided?” Xiao Qing urged.

“I’ll take that one,” Li Xian pointed to the Leopard Bone Pill in the upper right corner.

Xiao Qing nodded slightly; judging by her expression, this pill shouldn’t be too bad.

This pill cost one thousand two hundred and eighty-nine coins, which was one tael and over two hundred coins.

Li Xian’s money pouch was emptied, making him realize the importance of being promoted to a Grade C Guard. Grade C Guards received a ten percent discount. When calculated, that could save over a hundred coins.

“There are only four days left! In the coming days, I must seize every moment to practice my boxing!”

“Otherwise, waiting another year for the next martial art is too slow and too long.”

The next day.

During his morning training, Li Xian swallowed the Leopard Bone Pill. As the pill’s effect gradually took hold, he felt a slight heat in his leg bones.

\[Skill: Consumption\]
\[Proficiency: 12/500 (Entry)\]

This skill grew very slowly, but Li Xian was surprised to find that eating regular food could also increase Consumption proficiency. However, it was far less effective than swallowing pills.

The medicinal energy flowed through his entire body, and his blood and energy became more vigorous.

Li Xian practiced his boxing silently, accumulating internal strength and building up his boxing momentum. Snow fell heavily, but his will remained firm.

The Four Directions Fist gained about 70 proficiency daily. Although it hadn't reached perfection yet, the daily progress was significant. He was getting closer to his goal step by step. This feeling was very solid.

The only drawback was that “patrol duty” consumed too much time. He was often woken up in the middle of the night to walk back and forth in the courtyard against the cold wind.

In these past few days, Li Xian had many patrol shifts and was so busy that no one could see him.

Three days before the Guard Competition, a list was suddenly erected in the courtyard where everyone practiced.

The list contained the names of those participating in the upcoming Guard Competition.

“Grade A, B, and C Guards must all participate. Among Grade D Guards, forty-nine people have signed up.”

“The list of participants is as follows. You may check it yourselves. The Guard Competition will officially begin in three days.”

Pang Long said a few simple words and left.

The guards crowded around to look at the list and began discussing it.

“Purple-Faced Spring, why isn’t your name on the list? A month ago, weren’t you shouting that you wanted to be a Grade C Guard?”

“Haha, look at yourself. You should just stay in Grade D. You’re just making a fool of yourself.”

A burst of laughter came from the crowd.

Wang Chun, the second brother, usually loved to join the fun, but recent events had cooled his temper. When he saw the list go up, he instinctively wanted to take a look, but upon touching his face, he pretended he hadn’t seen it and took a detour.

However, the palm prints on his face were too obvious, and he was caught by someone who took the opportunity to mock him mercilessly.

“Hey!”

“You won’t believe who I saw. That Li Xian is actually on the list.”

“Purple-Faced Spring, Green-Faced Table, Black-Faced Zhao, don’t you worry. If I get matched against Li Xian in the competition, I’ll definitely slap him a few times to vent your anger for you.”

The mocking laughter spread, followed by waves of guffaws.

Wang Chun fled in anger. Li Xian watched his retreating back and shook his head internally. *Why bother paying attention to idle gossip?*

He immersed himself in his own world, throwing punch after punch.

Only after the crowd dispersed did he approach the list to check his opponents’ names.

“True opponents are usually only a handful of people.”

“It’s a pity that just from the names, I can’t tell much. Well, I’ll just have to adapt when I see them.”

The day of the competition arrived in the blink of an eye.

The weather grew increasingly freezing, with heavy snow and wind. The mountains outside the estate were already sealed off by snow.

The One Union Estate was some distance from Qingning County. Apart from the estate itself, there was no human presence for miles around.

Li Xian’s Four Directions Fist proficiency was now at \[1157/1500 (Minor Perfection)\].

Focusing his mind, he felt a warm current in his lower abdomen. The Qi in his Dantian was now the size of four fists. He circulated it through his flesh and blood. A heat radiated from his skin, melting the snowflakes that landed on it.

“I have a way to withstand the cold. This body of mine is no longer what it used to be.”
