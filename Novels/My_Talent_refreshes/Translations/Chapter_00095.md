**Chapter 95: Earth Spirit Spring Water, Battle**

Chu Ning had initially come into contact with the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit precisely by using the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art on this old man. So, with just one glance, Chu Ning recognized him. He wondered why Old Man Sun would appear here, and it was clear he was being pursued.

Though startled, Chu Ning had no intention of intervening. While Old Man Sun had given him some spirit stones back then, their relationship was, after all, purely transactional. Using his Qi-Gazing Art, Chu Ning saw that two of the pursuers were at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation, and one was at the seventh layer. If Old Man Sun hadn't constantly activated talismans, he would have been caught long ago with his fifth-layer Qi Condensation cultivation.

It wasn't until the figures had long since disappeared that Chu Ning emerged from the spirit field's restriction formation. However, Chu Ning had already changed his appearance. There was no particular reason for this; it was simply a cautious reaction upon seeing other people.

After leaving the restriction, Chu Ning remembered Ling Xiaobai and was about to take out his spirit beast bag to put it away.

"Ying!"

At that moment, Ling Xiaobai suddenly cried out. The next moment, Ling Xiaobai's voice transmission sounded in Chu Ning's mind: "Follow me!" It then nodded its head towards the northeast.

"Where are we going?" Chu Ning asked, slightly perplexed.

Ling Xiaobai didn't answer but dashed towards the northeast. Seeing this, Chu Ning quickly chased after it, calling out, "Xiaobai!"

"Ying!" Ling Xiaobai looked back at Chu Ning, then continued running forward. Chu Ning simultaneously felt its divine sense signal again: "Follow me!"

Watching Ling Xiaobai run ahead, Chu Ning hesitated. But when the little creature showed no sign of stopping after another call, Chu Ning had no choice but to follow.

Heading northeast, Chu Ning soon arrived at the mountain where he had previously practiced the Cyanwood Sword Art. Ling Xiaobai, however, showed no intention of stopping, taking a turn and rushing deeper into the mountain range. This caused Chu Ning to frown slightly. Going further into the mountains meant a higher chance of encountering demonic beasts. But as Ling Xiaobai continuously signaled him to follow, Chu Ning had no choice but to keep up. After all, any demonic beasts in this vicinity would only be low-grade or mid-grade first-tier. This was the first time the sapient Ling Xiaobai had reacted like this, making Chu Ning curious about where it was leading him.

After running for about another half an hour, Ling Xiaobai suddenly stopped before a small mountain stream.

"Ying!"

As Chu Ning hesitated, Ling Xiaobai suddenly moved up the stream. In a short while, man and beast arrived at the end of the stream. A not-too-large waterfall cascaded down, forming a pool of water there. The pool wasn't very deep, looking to be just over a person's height.

Just as Chu Ning was wondering why Ling Xiaobai had suddenly stopped: "Ying!" Ling Xiaobai turned its head, called out to Chu Ning, then directly leaped onto Chu Ning's shoulder and bobbed its head.

"You want me to fly you over?" Chu Ning asked, carefully looking around. It was then that he realized, having been distracted by the waterfall, that he hadn't noticed a stone crevice about three meters above the pool.

Having come all this way, Chu Ning naturally didn't hesitate. Taking out his Wind-Chasing Shuttle from his storage bag, Chu Ning soared into the air and flew towards the stone crevice. As soon as they reached the crevice, Ling Xiaobai leaped off Chu Ning and walked along the crevice inwards. Chu Ning put away his Wind-Chasing Shuttle and followed.

After advancing about ten meters, a small cave entrance appeared before Chu Ning. Man and beast entered the cave, and after walking another five meters, the interior suddenly opened up. A cave about thirty meters in diameter appeared before Chu Ning's eyes. The cave wasn't sealed; wind blew in and light penetrated through crevices, allowing Chu Ning to see the cave's full appearance. The cave was filled with rocks, with a small pool about three meters wide in the center, and various plants growing within.

As Chu Ning's gaze swept over these plants, his eyes suddenly lit up. "Bloodglow Grass!" Most of the plants here were ordinary flowers and grasses, but Chu Ning discovered several spirit plants known as Bloodglow Grass. This Bloodglow Grass was an excellent spirit herb for refining pills. Its value was even higher than the Golden Yuan Fruit and Iron Orchid Fruit that Chu Ning cultivated. However, these Bloodglow Grass plants were still very young seedlings.

"The spiritual energy here is so rich; no wonder these spirit plants can grow." Chu Ning now felt it too, muttering to himself. The next moment, his gaze fell upon the small pool in the center, for he sensed that the spiritual energy was most concentrated there. At this moment, Ling Xiaobai had already walked directly to the edge of the pool.

"Ying!"

Chu Ning walked over, and the next moment, his face was filled with surprise. This was no ordinary small pool; it was Earth Spirit Spring Water! This Earth Spirit Spring Water usually forms within mountains containing spirit veins. It is not entirely condensed from spiritual energy but rather forms accidentally over a long period when an existing underground spring continuously absorbs spiritual energy.

Drinking this Earth Spirit Spring Water directly does not have a very significant effect on cultivators. However, this Earth Spirit Spring Water is often accompanied by spirit herbs and plants, such as Bloodglow Grass. If used together, it has a very good body tempering effect. Therefore, many body cultivators go to great lengths to find it. Chu Ning had learned this information from the jade slip on body tempering methods that Zhuang Yunde had given him. What Chu Ning hadn't expected was that Earth Spirit Spring Water would exist in this branch mountain range.

"Body tempering?" Chu Ning's eyes flickered as he looked at the Earth Spirit Spring Water. Since he cultivated the Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art, he was naturally a body cultivator. However, as an ancient body tempering method, the Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art did not involve external aids for body tempering. So, he had never tried it before. But Chu Ning also felt that body tempering might be effective for him too. He had even considered using the Iron Orchid Fruit for body tempering if it ever matured. Yet, to his surprise, he had now encountered Earth Spirit Spring Water.

Just as Chu Ning's heart stirred, his brow furrowed, and he slowly walked towards a few small, pale red spirit grasses. The Earth Spirit Spring Water seemed to have formed a long time ago, so why were these Bloodglow Grass plants so tender? Bloodglow Grass of this maturity could not be used in conjunction with the Earth Spirit Spring Water.

As his gaze fell upon the area next to the Bloodglow Grass, his expression changed instantly. The soil next to these Bloodglow Grass plants was disturbed, clearly indicating that something had been uprooted. "Someone picked this Bloodglow Grass, and it's clearly recent." Thinking of this, Chu Ning instinctively thought of Old Man Sun and the group pursuing him. "Could it be that Old Man Sun picked it, and somehow others discovered it? Is that why they're chasing him?"

As this thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind, his gaze fell on Ling Xiaobai. If that were the case, Ling Xiaobai might have led him here because it sensed the aura Old Man Sun carried and followed it.

"Not good!" The next moment, Chu Ning cursed inwardly and quickly stood up. "That Old Man Sun's cultivation is lower than theirs; it'll be hard for him to escape. If those people know about this Earth Spirit Spring Water, they'll likely come looking for it."

Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately prepared to signal Ling Xiaobai to leave. But then, Chu Ning's expression changed slightly. His acute divine sense had already detected that someone was approaching the cave from the direction he and Ling Xiaobai had just come from.

"They're coming so fast?" Chu Ning gestured to Ling Xiaobai, then quickly flashed behind a large rock in the cave. He suppressed his aura, initially intending to put Ling Xiaobai into his spirit beast bag, but then decided against it for now. He simply instructed Ling Xiaobai not to make any sound. If there was real danger later, the little creature might even be able to provide some small help.

Just as Chu Ning finished hiding, less than two breaths later, several footsteps echoed in. Chu Ning's divine sense briefly detected four people. One was Old Man Sun, and the other three were precisely the ones who had been chasing him earlier.

"It really is them!" Chu Ning sighed inwardly. If it were just Old Man Sun alone, he wouldn't have cared much. But now there were so many people, and one of them was at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation, just like him. This could be troublesome. He only hoped these people wouldn't discover him. However, as this thought flashed by, Chu Ning's brows furrowed slightly. He hadn't paid much attention when he entered, so there must be footprints on the ground. If someone observed carefully, he might still be exposed. Thinking this, Chu Ning secretly became alert and prepared.

At the same time, several exclamations echoed in the cave.

"There's Earth Spirit Spring Water here!"

After a series of exclamations, a rough voice resonated within the cave. "Old Man Sun, there's such a treasure here. Good, good. So, the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit you and my third brother found back then, was it also from here? And then you killed my third brother to silence him, fearing the secret of this place would be exposed?"

"I didn't kill Liu Laosan," an older voice with a hint of helplessness responded. Chu Ning recognized it as Old Man Sun's voice. At the same time, Chu Ning felt a slight jolt in his heart. Liu Laosan? Could it be the bearded man he had killed before?

"Bullshit!" The rough voice roared again, filled with malice. "You and my third brother accidentally found the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit seeds here. You cultivated the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit and earned a huge sum of spirit stones. But my third brother disappeared a few months later. You say you didn't kill him? Who else could it be? Do you really think I, Boss Liu, am a fool?" After roaring, the man coldly snorted: "If my third brother hadn't left me a message just in case, and if we hadn't patiently staked you out for over a year, we probably wouldn't have discovered this."

"Brother, why waste words with him?" Another man's voice now chimed in. It was the yellow-faced man who had been standing next to the rough man, the one at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation, the highest among the three. "There's Earth Spirit Spring Water here, and this old man also picked Bloodglow Grass. You might as well temper your body here; we'll guard you. As for any extra Bloodglow Grass, we can sell it for spirit stones." As he spoke, his voice was filled with greed. "What's more, this old man sold so many Seven-Star Spirit Fruits; he must have a lot of good stuff on him."

"What do you want to do?" Old Man Sun's voice was tinged with panic. "You clearly told me that you would let me go if I handed over the Bloodglow Grass and brought you here."

"Let you go?" Boss Liu sneered. "Then who will avenge my third brother?"

Hearing this, Chu Ning finally understood the whole story. He began to hesitate, wondering if he should help Old Man Sun. After all, in a sense, he and Old Man Sun might be in the same camp. And if those three discovered him, they certainly wouldn't let him off easily.

Just as this thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind, the next moment, his eyes narrowed. At that very moment, a blue-robed youth among the three, who had been silent, suddenly brandished a spiked dagger. Immediately, he infused it with spiritual power, and the dagger flew out directly, transforming into a red light that shot towards Old Man Sun. The red light was incredibly fast, and coupled with the short distance between them, it almost instantly arrived behind Old Man Sun. However, Old Man Sun seemed to have been prepared. A yellow light shield suddenly appeared around him, blocking the red light.

"Why bother with all the chatter, just finish him off." At the same time, the blue-robed youth's slightly effeminate voice echoed in the cave. At his words, Old Man Sun's face turned ashen. However, he said nothing. Under the protection of the yellow light, Old Man Sun took out several talismans and quickly activated them.

Meanwhile, Boss Liu and the yellow-faced man exchanged glances, seemingly reaching a consensus. The yellow-faced man made the first move, using a short spear. As he unleashed his spiritual power, a yellow light shot towards Old Man Sun. He also activated a defensive talisman, blocking one of Old Man Sun's attacking white lights. Boss Liu, however, did not attack. After Old Man Sun's talismanic magic attacks came, he flashed past, dodging them.

The next moment, he charged directly towards Old Man Sun, a hammer appearing in his hand at the same time. Seeing Boss Liu's actions, Old Man Sun's expression changed slightly. He activated a talisman, seemingly an escape talisman, and flashed to the cave entrance. However, the blue-robed youth had already anticipated this and reached the entrance first, simultaneously launching a red light. Old Man Sun had to forcefully stop his movement and then activate another layer of white protective shield to block it. At the same time, a golden light shot towards Boss Liu.

"This old fellow has quite a lot of stuff on him!" The yellow-faced man exclaimed upon seeing this, his face filled with greed. A yellow light erupted from the short spear in his hand, and his attack was equally fierce. A red and a yellow light attacked simultaneously, instantly breaching Old Man Sun's protective shield. At the same time, Boss Liu also flashed over. A large hammer crashed down.

As the fierce battle was underway, the figures of one man and one beast now emerged from behind a giant rock.
