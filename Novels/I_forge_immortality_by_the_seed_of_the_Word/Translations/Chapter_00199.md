# 第一百九十六章 太上红业斩仙魔刀

Vast, seemingly infinite chains of divine law representing the Dao of Karma Fire grew larger in Zhang Jing's eyes, eventually filling his entire vision, occupying his mind. An indescribable terror suddenly arose in his consciousness.

It was—a giant god entirely formed of scarlet Karma Fire.

He seemed to be demonstrating something. A powerful arm suddenly rose high, and a bizarre, crescent-shaped blade appeared in his hand.

In an instant, a scarlet blade light that pierced the heavens and the earth suddenly ignited, illuminating the endless void.

Zhang Jing's breath hitched. Within that blade light, he seemed to 'see' the manifestation of countless Daos and principles: purification, termination, slaughter, karmic retribution…

Wherever the blade light passed, raging Karma Fire erupted. The earth trembled, the heavens wept, and immortals and gods bled.

A fragmented, indistinct message quietly appeared in his mind.

"Supreme… Karma Fire… Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade!"

Zhang Jing's eyes lit up. What a powerful offensive divine ability!

Of course, the [Supreme Karma Fire Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade] was not just an offensive divine ability; it was also a legacy that explained the Dao of Karma Fire. It naturally included cultivation methods, and it seemed to be a powerful method that led directly to the Heavenly Immortal realm.

However…

Zhang Jing's eyes flashed. The cultivation methods within were certainly tempting, but the path he would take in the future was already determined, so he could only use it for reference. After all, whether in terms of growth potential or other aspects, the Supreme Karma Fire Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade was far inferior to the legacy of the Primordial Origin World's derivation of worlds that he was currently cultivating.

Returning to reality, the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud erupted with full force. The vast legacy information about the Supreme Karma Fire Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade began to be imprinted in his mind bit by bit.

…

Time slowly passed.

At a certain moment, Zhang Jing suddenly stopped his comprehension. A hint of gloom flashed across his exhausted face.

"This is troublesome."

His heart was heavy. Perhaps due to the complexity and obscurity of the legacy, Zhang Jing's comprehension speed had become extremely slow. More importantly, after the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud advanced to an Immortal Seed, its consumption had become extremely terrifying. And he was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, so he couldn't maintain it for long.

Under the combined influence of these two factors, Zhang Jing felt that whether he could completely comprehend the legacy of the Supreme Karma Fire Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade before the three-year deadline arrived had become an unknown.

Just as he was feeling frustrated, he suddenly had an idea. He turned to look behind him and tentatively called out, "Um… Pride Cloud?!"

Instantly, the void rippled, and the spirit of the Pride Cloud Secret Realm slowly appeared in a black robe.

"Zhang Jing, what is it?" the other party asked softly, looking at Zhang Jing, his tone neither humble nor arrogant.

"May I ask how much time has passed?"

"Three months."

"I understand, thank you."

"It's my duty."

As soon as the voice fell, the figure of the Secret Realm Spirit began to fade away little by little.

Seeing this, Zhang Jing hurriedly stopped the other party, a look of embarrassment on his face. "Um, the method you used in the Secret Realm to quickly restore the mana and divine sense of cultivators, can it still be used now?"

The Secret Realm Spirit paused. It looked at Zhang Jing in surprise, seemingly not understanding why the other party didn't focus on comprehending the Undying Pride Sun at this time, but instead asked about these unimportant things.

Then, "Of course," the Secret Realm Spirit replied without thinking.

"Then, in the remaining time, can you help me restore my mana and divine sense?" Zhang Jing said rather embarrassedly.

He knew that this request was a bit difficult for the Secret Realm Spirit in front of him. After all, the other party had no obligation to help him. But in order to completely comprehend the Supreme Karma Fire Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade legacy within the time limit, Zhang Jing couldn't care so much. He could only go all out.

On the opposite side, a trace of reluctance flashed in the Secret Realm Spirit's eyes subconsciously, but he didn't say much. He just waved his hand. Then, the void above Zhang Jing's head rippled, and a hazy immortal light fell, directly enveloping him.

In an instant, Zhang Jing's previously consumed mana and divine sense began to recover quickly.

"Phew—it really works!" He couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. The heaviness in his heart gradually dissipated.

Zhang Jing turned around and looked gratefully at the Secret Realm Spirit, but found that the other party's figure had disappeared quietly.

"Thank you!" he said silently.

With the blessing of this immortal light, he finally had some confidence in completely comprehending the Supreme Karma Fire Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade legacy.

Boom!

The six layers of Auspicious Cloud above Zhang Jing's head suddenly erupted with unprecedented vast immortal light.

…

One year! Two years! Two and a half years!

Time passed little by little. Under the support of the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud, which was driven without regard to consumption, the various scattered insights in Zhang Jing's mind had gathered into a sea, faintly condensing into the appearance of a demon blade.

…

On a certain low mountain, a figure that had long been covered in dust quietly opened his eyes, and bronze divine light suddenly bloomed.

As the divine light swept across, all the dust on Feng Wuyu's body disappeared. The whole person was refreshed.

At this moment, his eyes were flashing with undisguised excitement.

"With this understanding, I am one big step closer to completing the second transformation of Dao Integration. At most, I will need another three thousand years! This time, I owe my junior brother a big favor." Feng Wuyu said with a smile.

However, in the next instant, as if thinking of something, a hint of regret flashed between his eyebrows.

"Alas~ it's a pity that the divine lord's Karma Fire Dao's true meaning is too vast and obscure. It is indeed not something we can comprehend."

"If I could comprehend the inheritance of divine abilities and methods containing the Karma Fire Dao from it, with the Dao meaning and principles within, I might be able to complete the accumulation of the second transformation of Dao Integration in one step and reach the third transformation."

Coming back to his senses, Feng Wuyu couldn't help but laugh at himself. What was he daydreaming about? How could the Dao of an Undying Golden Immortal be comprehended so easily?

But at this moment, "Immortal Elder, you're awake? It's been two years and nine months since you first entered seclusion. May I ask if you have any instructions?"

The figure of the Secret Realm Spirit suddenly emerged, bowing and looking respectfully at Feng Wuyu.

While speaking, a hint of surprise couldn't help but rise in his heart.

"His aura has actually increased so much? It seems that this Immortal Elder has gained a lot in the Secret Realm."

"What did I say? With the profoundness and unpredictability of the Undying Pride Sun, only those at the Dao Integration realm can gain something from it. As for the cultivators below, it's better to focus on improving their realm honestly."

"No matter how strong your talent is, it's not a reason to be too ambitious." The Secret Realm Spirit under the black robe shook his head slightly.

"Eh, where is Junior Brother Zhang Jing? How is his harvest from comprehending the Undying Pride Sun?"

In place, after Feng Wuyu scanned around without success, he decisively looked at the Secret Realm Spirit, his words full of concern.

"Reporting to the Immortal Elder, Zhang Jing is over there!"

Hearing this, the Secret Realm Spirit stretched out his hand and pointed directly to the north, while saying flatteringly, "As for the harvest… you must have expected it."

"Me? Expected it?"

Feng Wuyu was stunned when he heard these words.

He was about to ask what it meant, but in the next moment, a faint fluctuation of true meaning suddenly came from the north.

The moment they sensed it, a scarlet demon blade entangled with boundless Karma Fire appeared in front of Feng Wuyu and the Secret Realm Spirit.

"This is?"

Feng Wuyu was shocked.

A guess that he couldn't believe, but had to believe, suddenly appeared in his mind.

And next to him, the Secret Realm Spirit's sluggish gaze slowly looked to the north.

The wisp of true meaning fluctuation just now seemed to have come from the direction of Zhang Jing.

"No way!" he thought.

Before the words could fall, the figures of Feng Wuyu and the Secret Realm Spirit disappeared from the spot.
