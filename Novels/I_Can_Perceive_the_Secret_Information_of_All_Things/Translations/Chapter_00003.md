# Chapter 3: What Lies Within the Womb

The first snow lasted three days before finally stopping.  

The town and distant mountains were blanketed in white. The people of Willow Town bundled up in heavy clothes as they cleared the snow in front of their homes, some shoveling toward their neighbors' doors while others swept toward theirs...  

Here and there, a few beggars and wanderers had frozen to death in the streets.  

The crisp air dampened the usual clamor, leaving the entire town unusually quiet.  

Only the Lu household was different.  

Lu Jinyin had carefully selected a group of experts to gather today, hoping they could help his wife deliver the child she had been carrying for three years and six months.  

The group watched the closed door with bated breath—some wide-eyed, others with hands tucked in their sleeves, a few craning their necks... From inside came violent sounds: the woman's furious screams, the shattering of objects, and the clanking of chains...  

"Esteemed experts, inside lies my wife, who has been pregnant for three years and six months. I've sought medical help for over two years, exhausting all my savings..." Lu Jinyin addressed the gathered crowd in the courtyard.  

At this, many gasped and exchanged hushed whispers.  

Lu Jinyin quickly added, "But rest assured, I have three shops, liquid silver, and some valuable collections I can offer as payment. Money is no concern."  

"Oh~" the crowd murmured in unison, their whispers ceasing.  

Xiao Ji stood among them, observing the so-called experts—a Daoist physician, a midwife, a monk, a sect cultivator, even a martial artist proudly baring his shoulders in the winter cold, not to mention fellow Daoists. There was even a woman scribbling notes in a book. A motley crew, indeed.  

Since these people had been invited by the Lu family, regardless of their professions, they must have some expertise in childbirth.  

Xiao Ji took a few steps, discreetly assessing those nearby.  

**[This is a fake monk—his head was shaved just days ago, with three fresh scars...]**  

**[This Daoist physician is at Qi Refining Level 1. Half a year ago, he accidentally killed a patient, lost his entire fortune in compensation, and was driven out of Chaotou County, wandering here in destitution...]**  

**[This midwife is impatient—when delivering babies, she yanks too hard in her haste...]**  

Then came a startling realization: among the dozen or so "experts" in the courtyard, Xiao Ji, at Qi Refining Level 2, was the strongest.  

Lu Jinyin's hiring standards were truly abysmal.  

Then again, those willing to take on such work for mere silver were hardly top-tier experts. True masters sought spirit stones, not mundane wealth.  

Still, at least these people looked the part.  

The monk wore a thick golden chain around his neck, its round beads swaying in the wind, lending him an air of carefree detachment.  

The cultivator's sword was enormous, its tip nearly scraping the ground behind his heels...  

Their expressions were also worth studying—some stern and narrow-eyed, exuding an imperious aura, others maintaining an enigmatic smile that defied interpretation...  

Xiao Ji found this rather impressive. Compared to his own shabby appearance, he hardly looked like a profound Daoist. Once he returned to the Primordial Spirit Temple, he resolved to discuss with his master about using their meager savings to commission a new Daoist robe and crafting a flashier magical artifact with the spirit stones he had hoarded for years.  

Quality aside, at least he could cultivate an air of effortless grace.  

"My wife has grown increasingly unstable lately, eating more and more, even biting people in her agitation," Lu Jinyin continued describing his wife's condition.  

The scene confirmed his words.  

Servants carried trays of food into the room at regular intervals, and occasionally, someone would come running out, howling in pain.  

"Esteemed experts, I've gathered you here today in hopes of helping my wife deliver this child. Don't just stand in the courtyard—please, come inside." Lu Jinyin ushered them in.  

The room was spacious enough to accommodate the group without crowding.  

There, they saw Lu Jinyin's wife.  

Her belly was swollen and restless, as if the fetus inside were practicing martial arts.  

"Husband, save me," the woman groaned, her face sickly pale, lips bloodless, hair disheveled. Her hands flailed at her face—had she not been restrained by heavy chains, she might have clawed her own skin to shreds.  

At the sight of her husband, tears streamed down her cheeks.  

The woman, bound in thick chains, no longer seemed human, her strength terrifyingly immense.  

"Everyone, I beg you—use your powers!" Lu Jinyin was on the verge of stomping his feet in desperation.  

"Why not seek the authorities? Let the Town Pacification Bureau handle this," someone suggested.  

Lu Jinyin's face twisted in anguish. "My wife and I grew up together, childhood sweethearts who've loved each other for half our lives. You all know that if the Bureau intervened, they'd likely execute her as a demon. That's why I've only sought help among the people. I can't bear to lose her."  

Such devotion was moving.  

"Ami—uh..." The fake monk suddenly spoke, his voice rich and resonant—though he seemed to have forgotten his lines.  

"Tuo Fo (Buddha)," the impatient midwife finished for him.  

"Right, Amituofo (Amitabha Buddha)," the monk said.  

A pause.  

The midwife frowned at him. "Well? What else were you going to say?"  

"Nothing. I was just sighing in sympathy," the monk replied.  

Eyes rolled. If he wanted attention, this wasn't the way. Even silent, his gilded presence was hard to miss.  

"Based on my years of midwifery, your wife likely carries a malignant fetus—not a true child, but a vengeful spirit. We need only kill the thing in her womb," the midwife rasped. "I can extract the evil, but... your wife would likely die with it."  

Before Lu Jinyin could respond, the Daoist physician interjected, "Cases of demonic pregnancies are exceedingly rare. In all my years, I've only encountered one. Until we confirm the diagnosis, let's not jump to conclusions."  

He stepped forward, producing a red thread. With a flick of his wrist, one end wrapped around the woman's thrashing arm while he pinched the other between thumb and middle finger, channeling his energy.  

"Pulse diagnosis via thread?" a few murmured in awe.  

Observation, listening, questioning, and pulse-taking weren't just for physicians—Daoist healers employed them too, albeit with spiritual techniques. This "suspended thread diagnosis" relied on qi to assess the patient's condition.  

The thread trembled, glowing faintly as the woman resisted.  

Then—*snap*—it broke in half.  

The Daoist physician staggered back, alarmed. "There truly is a demonic presence inside!"  

Had Xiao Ji not steadied him, the man would have fallen.  

In that brief contact:  

**[This Daoist physician is haunted by memories of the patient he killed half a year ago—a wealthy lady from Chaotou County, also pregnant with a demonic entity. The trauma makes him reluctant to treat such cases.]**  

**[Deepened perception—Cultivation +2.]**  

"Please, save my wife!" Lu Jinyin pleaded.  

The physician sighed, retreating. "Let me... think of a solution."  

Most of the gathered experts were frauds, passing the buck until Lu Jinyin's wife grew visibly weaker. Only then did Xiao Ji step forward.  

He extended two fingers, stopping three inches from the woman's distended belly.  

The room held its breath, wondering what this shabby-looking Daoist intended to do.  

"Your wife carries no demon," Xiao Ji said calmly.
