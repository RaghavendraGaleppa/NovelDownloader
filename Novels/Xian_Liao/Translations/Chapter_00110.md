# Chapter 110: The Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace

Zhou Qing surveyed the eight murals surrounding him, each depicting a Daoist with blurred features. As he focused on each painting, corresponding divine intent emerged, allowing him to comprehend their cultivation techniques.

Fusong whispered, "Heaven, Earth, Mountain, Marsh, Water, Fire, Wind, and Thunder. Each of these eight murals corresponds to one of the Eight Trigrams."

Zhou Qing nodded. "Indeed. Without a solid foundation of qi and blood, it's best not to attempt this."

As he spoke, he recalled the blood peaches outside. If his guess was correct, those peaches were meant to supplement one's qi-blood foundation.

Zhou Qing directed his spiritual sense toward the stone platform, encountering an invisible barrier. Concentrating his divine sense, he pierced through it.

The patterns on the stone platform suddenly glowed, imprinting themselves onto Zhou Qing's crane-feather cloak to form an Eight Trigrams symbol. Simultaneously, the platform split open, revealing a piece of jade and a green pouch.

When Zhou Qing probed the pouch with his spiritual sense, he was pleasantly surprised. "A storage treasure pouch." Inside were neatly arranged spirit stones—over a hundred of them—along with a token and an array diagram.

Next, Zhou Qing picked up the jade piece. As he channeled his true qi into it, a flood of information poured into his mind.

"Yin-Yang Treasure Vase, Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace."

The jade contained methods for forging a Dao Furnace—two distinct paths. One was the Yin-Yang Treasure Vase, the other the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace. Master Jingyang had cultivated the Yin-Yang Treasure Vase, a method he had discovered in an ancient cultivator's cave dwelling.

The Yin-Yang Treasure Vase excelled in combat, while the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace was tailored for alchemy. At higher levels, the Yin-Yang Treasure Vase could refine Yin-Yang Divine Light, an exceptionally formidable supernatural ability. The Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace, on the other hand, could cultivate the Samadhi True Fire.

The Samadhi True Fire was rooted in the cultivation of essence, qi, and spirit. When paired with the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace, it could effortlessly refine any spiritual herb.

"My combat abilities are already sufficient. The Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace offers more comprehensive benefits. The Samadhi True Fire it produces can even temper magical artifacts, enabling them to advance in grade."

Though Zhou Qing recognized the terrifying offensive potential of the Yin-Yang Treasure Vase's supernatural abilities, he believed the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace's versatility—especially its advantages in alchemy and artifact refinement—made it the superior choice. Moreover, while the Yin-Yang Treasure Vase was a method for forging a Dao Furnace, Zhou Qing suspected the Yin-Yang Divine Light technique it contained wasn't beyond his comprehension.

Additionally, Zhou Qing gleaned information about the token and the array diagram: the Qiankun Teleportation Token and the Teleportation Array Diagram. Only Foundation Establishment or Furnace-level cultivators could safely use the teleportation array to reach other cultivation regions.

This teleportation array was one-way. To return, one needed the Qiankun Teleportation Token, which could transport a maximum of three people at a time, including the token holder.

Zhou Qing continued absorbing the knowledge left by Master Jingyang in the jade. After reaching the Furnace stage, the energy used was called True Gang; after Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment, it was called True Essence. The power of the Dao Furnace was known as Dharma Power, combining characteristics of both True Gang and True Essence.

To forge the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace, one needed to comprehend the eight murals corresponding to the Eight Trigrams. Zhou Qing surmised that Master Jingyang had intended for later arrivals to cultivate the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace. The final guardian—the Foundation Establishment-level white ape demon—was meant to ensure that only those at the Furnace stage or equivalent could proceed. However, there was an exception: someone like Zhou Qing, who had reached the pinnacle of the Innate Realm, could still defeat the ape demon.

In such cases, the Dao Furnace forging method was prepared specifically for them. Each of the eight murals contained peerless techniques leading directly to the Furnace stage. Ordinary body cultivators attempting to practice any of these techniques would need to consume the blood peaches outside to strengthen their qi-blood foundation.

Zhou Qing didn't need to practice these techniques himself. Instead, he sought to absorb the insights from the eight murals to aid in forging his Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace.

"This place is secluded, rich in spiritual energy, and has spiritual herbs like the blood peaches. It's perfect for our cultivation," Zhou Qing declared to his companions after making his decision.

He took a bite of a blood peach and immediately felt a surge of slaughterous energy assault his spirit. However, Zhou Qing's spiritual power was formidable—this energy was like an ant trying to shake a tree, utterly ineffective. For Fusong, though, it wasn't so simple.

Zhou Qing advised Fusong to consume the peach in small bites, refining its medicinal properties gradually. After one refinement session, Fusong could then attempt to comprehend the mural of his choice. Fusong selected the Mountain trigram, which aligned well with his Bear's Roar Golden Bell Technique.

Zhang Jingxiu, on the other hand, handled the blood peach more easily and chose the Fire trigram. Its technique was a natural extension of his One Qi Sunrise Talisman Canon.

Zhou Qing, meanwhile, focused on comprehending all eight murals simultaneously. The Eight Trigrams symbol on his crane-feather cloak seemed to have recognized him as its master—even if he removed the cloak, the symbol would transfer to his inner armor, refusing to leave him. He could also use his spiritual sense to conceal the symbol from others' sight.

The jade also recorded a supernatural ability called "Thousand Illusions." This technique allowed one to alter their appearance and aura, even concealing their power. By observing and interacting with someone over time, one could use Thousand Illusions to assume their identity.

Zhou Qing mused, "Isn't this the perfect ability for mischief?" He then considered the blurred faces of the Daoists in the murals. Since these were left by Master Jingyang, the absence of clear features suggested he didn't want others using Thousand Illusions to mimic his appearance. Notably, even the Taihe Sect lacked portraits of Master Jingyang.

Zhou Qing pondered further. "Not leaving behind images—it's probably more than just that." He speculated that cultivators and demonic beings possessed countless supernatural means, some of which might harm others through images or auras. Master Jingyang's avoidance of leaving traces might stem from this reasoning.

The wisdom of predecessors was always worth heeding. Zhou Qing resolved to master Thousand Illusions after successfully forging his Dao Furnace. Taking advice to heart was the path to prosperity.

Having stayed here for some time without encountering any anomalies, Zhou Qing concluded this was indeed a significant opportunity. Of course, there were minor oddities—like the peach tree outside Jingyang's cave dwelling, which was clearly a demonic entity yet displayed no aggression. This reminded Zhou Qing of the mulberry tree back home, which, though benign, tolerated no one but him.

The most docile demonic entity he'd encountered, however, was the great pine tree on Taihe Mountain. It treated Zhou Qing with reverence, obeying his every command. This pine tree was no ordinary entity—when the Great Zhou's founding emperor attacked Taihe Mountain, it had shrouded itself in ghostly mist and harnessed the mountain's power. Now revered as Taihe Mountain's guardian tree, it even received offerings.

Zhang Jingxiu often lamented, though, that the pine tree produced cones at a glacial pace—it would likely be thirty years before the next harvest. Zhou Qing consoled him, saying that if Zhang didn't break through to the Furnace stage, he might still have two more chances to taste the pine nuts in his remaining lifespan. This consolation only deepened Zhang's melancholy.

In the following days, Zhou Qing leisurely contemplated the eight murals, gradually attuning himself to the eight natural forces they represented: Heaven, Earth, Mountain, Marsh, Water, Fire, Wind, and Thunder. He took his time, in no rush to forge his Dao Furnace. When his insights were sufficient, the breakthrough would come naturally.

He consumed few blood peaches, as they offered him little benefit—he lacked neither qi-blood supplements nor vitality. Zhang Jingxiu ate four, Fusong seven. Any more would have been ineffective. The remaining peaches would be taken back for others.

Before consuming the peaches, Zhang Jingxiu had already broken through to the third level of body refinement. The peaches helped consolidate his qi-blood and pushed him to the peak of the third level. Zhou Qing attributed this to Zhang's comprehension of fist intent—a crucial foundation for reaching the Furnace stage and a marker of martial talent.

Interestingly, despite his advanced age, Zhang Jingxiu exhibited astonishing potential in cultivation. Initially overshadowed by Fushan, he had caught up within a few years. "A late bloomer?" Zhou Qing mused. Perhaps the late resurgence of spiritual energy had delayed Zhang's rise. After all, Zhang was the only one who had endured heavenly lightning and advanced to the Innate Realm without adverse effects.

"Brother Zhang, are you planning to attempt the Furnace stage now?" Zhou Qing asked, surprised by Zhang's urgency despite his late-bloomer status.

Zhang Jingxiu replied, "Cultivation demands boldness and diligence. I feel the time is right. If anything goes wrong, I have you to watch over me."

Zhou Qing smiled. "Then I'll take this opportunity to observe the unique aspects of a body cultivator's Furnace forging."

"When will you forge your Dao Furnace? You seem utterly unhurried," Zhang asked curiously.

Zhou Qing chuckled. "After you break through, I'll forge mine."

"Just like that?" Zhang was incredulous.

"It's a natural progression. I'm only taking time to comprehend the eight murals for the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace, which isn't particularly difficult—I've nearly finished. Here, take the white ape demon's essence blood. As a Foundation Establishment-level demon, it should aid your breakthrough."

Zhang, already briefed by Zhou Qing on demon essence blood's uses, accepted without hesitation. The remaining essence blood, which Zhou Qing had stored in jade bottles, was given to Morning Sun, who disdained the peaches but relished the blood, entering a slow metamorphosis.

Zhou Qing then focused on assisting Zhang's breakthrough, hoping to glean insights for his own Dao Furnace forging. Every bit helped.

Fusong, though envious, could only watch as Zhang prepared for his ascent. Soon, everything was in place, and Zhang Jingxiu's breakthrough to the Furnace stage began.
