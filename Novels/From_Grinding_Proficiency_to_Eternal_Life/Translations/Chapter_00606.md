# Chapter 606: This Person Must Be Befriended!

Xu Yunfan’s attitude was respectful, his words sincere, and he lowered his posture to the extreme.

*Since I’m acting like this, you surely can’t find fault with me now.*

Zhang Qiaoluo’s gaze fell on Xu Yunfan, scrutinizing him from head to toe.

The man before her was handsome and upright. The vital energy around him was harmonious yet restrained, faintly containing the power of thunder, proving he was no ordinary cultivator. Moreover, he was someone whom True Lord Qingyuan had recently taken a great liking to, and he seemed to be proficient in both array formations and artifact refining.

Her thoughts raced. Within the Primordial Origin Sect, disciples like Xu Yunfan, who appeared normal and possessed genuine talent, were indeed rare.

If she might need him to refine artifacts or set up arrays in the future, it would be unwise to form a grudge now. Besides, since she was filling in for someone, he would owe her a favor, making it inconvenient to cause too much of a scene.

"Hmph."

A cold snort came from Zhang Qiaoluo’s nose, the corner of her mouth twitching slightly as a response. However, the icy air of rejection did not completely dissipate.

"I heard that Sect Leader Xu is a busy man. The moment you came out of seclusion, you had endless matters to attend to. It is not easy for you to remember to come to this Chaotic Wind Gorge."

The sarcasm in her tone was still obvious.

*Women!*

"You flatter me, Senior Sister!"

Xu Yunfan bowed again. "It is all this Junior Brother's fault. In the future, should Senior Sister have any instructions, as long as it concerns array formations or artifact refining, Yunfan will give his all and never shirk the task!"

*I was waiting for those very words.*

Although the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect treated vows like garbage, with such a statement, as long as Xu Yunfan wanted to continue serving under True Lord Qingyuan, he would definitely have to follow through.

When one walks the path of the world, one must still have a bit of honor.

Furthermore, Xu Yunfan had already given her a way down. If she didn't take it...

They were all disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect; everyone knew what kind of temper they had.

With these words, Zhang Qiaoluo’s expression softened slightly.

Xu Yunfan’s artifact refining on Mount Shenxiao was somewhat famous within the sect, and his attainments in array formations had been proven by slaying Blood Elder Devil and instantly resisting the gods of the Heavenly Court. If she could form a good connection, it would be greatly beneficial for asking him to help refine a secret treasure to hide her fate or set up a supreme array to protect her cave dwelling in the future.

At this critical juncture where they were about to join forces to kill a great enemy, and with the other party being so sensible, there was no need to continue embarrassing him.

Her cold expression eased by a fraction, and she stopped speaking, tacitly agreeing to Lu Chuan's peacemaking.

Lu Chuan’s eyes flashed with a hint of approval as he gestured to another extremely tall and burly figure.

This man resembled a half-iron tower, with knotted muscles and a bronze complexion. He wore a coarse cloth short jacket, but it could not hide the vast, surging physical strength that seemed capable of overturning mountains and seas with a mere movement.

Just standing there, he gave off a heavy pressure, as if the rocks beneath his feet were groaning slightly.

"This is Senior Brother Sun Yue," Lu Chuan introduced. "He cultivates the *'Warrior Giant Spirit True Art of Ten Thousand Calamities Indestructibility.'* He excels in both body and法, having reached the late Foundation Establishment stage. He is the vanguard of our Qingyuan Peak lineage! His physical strength is absolutely no less than that of a great True Person at the peak of Foundation Establishment."

"Junior Brother Xu."

Sun Yue's voice was like the friction of metal and stone, low and powerful.

He grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth, and returned the salute with a fist clasp. His gaze swept up and down Xu Yunfan, carrying a purely scrutinizing look as to whether this person was durable in a fight.

"I heard that your fight with Blood Elder Devil was very satisfying. The hint of aura leaking from your Thunder Array was not weak."

The last two words were a high evaluation coming from his mouth.

He was clearly not very interested in Xu Yunfan's arrays, but rather in the power he displayed in a head-on clash with an old devil like Blood Elder Devil.

If he hadn't been out seeking his own opportunities at the time, he definitely would have wanted to witness it personally.

*Trying to counter the opponent's strength with their own specialty? A guy with nothing but muscles in his head?*

Xu Yunfan secretly formed an impression, then immediately dismissed the thought.

No one who achieves the Foundation Establishment realm in the Primordial Origin Sect is a fool.

Unlike Blood Elder Devil, who had undergone five cycles of reincarnation, his lifespan was nearing its end. The filth of five lifetimes had clouded his intellect, making him a pawn.

As for the Sun Yue before him, Xu Yunfan didn't believe he was as straightforward as he appeared on the surface.

*It's a persona.*

"You flatter me, Senior Brother Sun. It was just luck."

Sun Yue's aura was thick and tyrannical, truly resembling the presence of True Person Baiyue Chu Chengnan from back then. He walked the path of extreme physical strength, likely even stronger than Blood Elder Devil back in the day.

The last person was thin as a bamboo stalk, wearing a gray, inconspicuous cloth robe.

His face was ordinary, wearing a near wooden calmness. Only his eyes were deep as an abyss, seemingly devoid of any emotional color, looking at people with a cold, indifferent gaze as if inspecting some material.

At his waist hung an ancient-styled, pitch-black, light-absorbing long sword in its sheath.

"Senior Brother Mo Qisha," Lu Chuan pointed to this person. "He is proficient in the *'Seven Extremes Demon Sword True Gang that Slaughter Gods.'* He has reached the peak of late Foundation Establishment. His sword strikes without a shadow, slaying gods invisibly. He specializes in severing life force and suppressing soul escape techniques."

Mo Qisha did not salute or speak. He merely nodded slightly at Xu Yunfan, his gaze sweeping past indifferently, as if passing over a stone on the roadside.

The moment his gaze passed Xu Yunfan's glabella, a trace of extremely fine sharpness, as if capable of cutting the origin of the soul, flashed and vanished. Even Xu Yunfan's perfect Shenxiao Dao Body felt a slight chill.

This was absolutely a terrifying figure specialized in slaughter and severing all life force.

Xu Yunfan also returned the salute. "Greetings, Senior Brother Mo."

He raised his vigilance against this person to the highest.

This man was even more of a pure tool existing solely for slaughter than Zhang Qiaoluo.

The Qingyuan True Lord lineage had truly sent out their elite to surround and kill Ye Yuan.

Two peak Foundation Establishment cultivators, Lu Chuan and Zhang Qiaoluo; one quasi-peak Giant Spirit Battle Body cultivator, Sun Yue; one peak late Foundation Establishment sword cultivator specialized in slaughter and rearguard actions, Mo Qisha; plus Xu Yunfan, a late Foundation Establishment cultivator focusing on controlling the field with arrays.

Such a lineup对付 a peer sword cultivator was like a lion hunting a rabbit—absolutely necessary and guaranteed to succeed.

It was truly luxurious.

*Ye Yuan, Ye Yuan, to be surrounded and killed by five Foundation Establishment True Persons far exceeding their peers, you are worthy enough.*

Lu Chuan’s gaze swept over everyone, finally landing back on Xu Yunfan. He said solemnly, "Everyone is here. Junior Brother Xu, Senior Sister Zhang previously used a tracking technique. Ye Yuan has entered the 'Weeping Wind Valley' area to patrol, not far from here."

"Set up the array immediately, turning this place into a cage to cut off all his paths of retreat."

He pointed to the narrowest section of the gorge where the wind was most chaotic and violent.

"It is best to use this place as the core to set up your supreme array. Senior Brother Sun, Senior Brother Mo, you two will follow me in the main assault later."

"Senior Sister Zhang, you will specialize in restraining his soul secret techniques and sword heart resonance, preventing him from calling for aid or having any backup plans."

"Junior Brother Qisha, you will hide at the edge of the array formation. The moment he intends to self-detonate his soul or施展 a 'cutting tail to survive' tactic, your sword must be the first to sever all his thoughts!"

"Understood."

"Alright!"

The group responded with heavy voices.
