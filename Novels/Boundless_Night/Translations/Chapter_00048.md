**Chapter 48: Unconventional**

The room was warm. At first, Old Man Liu did most of the talking, with Qin Ming listening quietly. Eventually, the two of them began to discuss things together.

Qin Ming was quite expectant, a little excited. In such a dangerous environment, he yearned for a third rebirth, unwilling to experience being chased by giant beasts again.

If he were stronger, the people from Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect wouldn't dare to coerce them, treating them as consumables sent underground to prospect for minerals.

Old Man Liu took a sip of water and said, "After we enter the mountain, we need to carefully observe the terrain and plan our escape routes before taking action."

"Why do I feel like you're not very confident, old man?" Qin Ming asked suspiciously, worried about problems at crucial moments.

Old Man Liu said, "Better safe than sorry, because we can't afford to lose. The place we're going has rare spiritual substances and is very dangerous. Failure means death."

Qin Ming also grew cautious, saying, "Does Silver Vine Town have any homemade explosives? Let's buy some!"

"If you put it that way, it really opens up my mind. We can consider a few other places now," Old Man Liu surprisingly had alternative plans.

"Tell me about them."

"In the mountains, in the West Gully area, there's a lake where a thrice-mutated old turtle is lying dormant. Its whole body is a treasure, and its turtle blood is full of spiritual substance. It's hibernating right now. If we can dig it out while it's deeply asleep, and throw homemade explosives into its turtle cave, I think it might succeed!"

Old Man Liu grew excited at this point, even wanting to replace the first plan with going after that spiritual turtle.

Qin Ming cooled him down, reminding him, "The turtle's shell has astonishing defense. Homemade explosives might not be able to shatter it. Most importantly, the lake is so big, how would we find it? Are we going to dig until the end of time?"

"You're right. Spiritual creatures are naturally stronger than aberrants of the same level. A thrice-mutated spiritual turtle probably can't be blown up, especially since this breed has long legs, and when it goes mad, its speed isn't slow."

Old Man Liu calmed down and dismissed the idea himself. That spiritual turtle had already undergone three mutations twenty years ago, so it should be even more formidable now.

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming's expression changed instantly. He felt something was off. "Old man, are all these pieces of information you're providing from one or two decades ago?"

"Don't worry, I'm not that unreliable," Old Man Liu shook his head, denying it.

He then brought up another alternative plan: using homemade explosives to scare monkeys. By creating a huge explosion, they would frighten away all the long-armed gibbons, then go to their nest to retrieve the spiritual substance.

Qin Ming looked at him with a strange gaze. How were all these plans so unconventional?

Old Man Liu said, "From my heart, I really want to wipe out that den of gibbons. They're too hateful!"

Qin Ming asked, "Were you bullied by monkeys, old man? Aren't they more than twenty li away? That's quite far from us."

Old Man Liu tapped the table. "Bringing justice to the people, understand? In Emei Town, many people who went into the mountains were robbed of their prey by the long-armed gibbons, and some were even dragged away."

Qin Ming immediately understood that he must have encountered that group of monkeys and was still resentful!

"I don't think that's reliable. What if it doesn't scare the long-armed gibbons away, but instead provokes their ferocity, and they chase us all over the mountains? That would be terrible. Monkeys are the most vengeful creatures."

Old Man Liu said, "Although it's not entirely stable, it is feasible. Thirty years ago, someone caused a huge commotion, using a diversionary tactic to successfully raid the Mountain Lord's lair. It was a similar method."

"That fierce? That's actually possible!" Qin Ming couldn't help but exclaim. That Mountain Lord was even more powerful than Old Bear and the old ox from Wild Ox Ridge.

Old Man Liu shook his head and said, "The Mountain Lord is even more vengeful. Although it wasn't as powerful then as it is now, it was extremely fierce. Three months after the incident, it directly broke into Silver Vine Town one late night and tore those two people to shreds."

Qin Ming, who had just thought those two were formidable and whose thoughts had become lively, was now forced to calm down. "I think all your alternative plans are unreliable. The first one is still the most suitable. Let's go into the mountain!"

As soon as they left the house, they saw people from Golden Rooster Ridge entering the village. Their ground-running chickens as mounts were too distinctive; they were the only ones who used them.

"Golden Rooster Ridge still has people available, huh? Why didn't they all die cleanly in the Great Rift Valley?" Old Man Liu whispered.

When these two arrived, all the villagers grew nervous. After all, Golden Rooster Ridge's predecessor was a notorious bandit group, and even after being officially recruited, their nature hadn't changed much.

"We're here to survey. How many new cultivators are there in your village? Come register," said a middle-aged man on a ground-running chicken.

Everyone's heart sank. Were they seeking revenge?

Because everyone knew that almost all the people from Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect who entered the Great Rift Valley this time were annihilated. In contrast, none of the mountain folk died; they all escaped.

Given Golden Rooster Ridge's usual conduct, it was highly likely they would vent their anger on the new cultivators who escaped from the surrounding villages.

Xu Yueping whispered, "Some larger villages have been surveyed since yesterday."

Qin Ming said, "What does it have to do with us that the people from Golden Rooster Ridge couldn't escape? They're in a powerful position, yet their survival skills are inferior to the oppressed mountain folk. Who's to blame?"

Old Man Liu said, "They won't reason with you. That's just how the world is. If you're strong enough, even for a simple wedding or funeral, high-level aberrants from the mountains might personally attend the feast. If you're weak, even monkeys will bully you when you go into the mountains. People still have to strengthen themselves."

He added, "The old monsters deep in the mountains and the high-ranking officials in Crimson Cloud City have dealings with each other. Don't disbelieve me; the old mountain patrolman I knew said it himself back then."

After registering, the two from Golden Rooster Ridge didn't linger and quickly left.

"I reckon they might want to replenish their manpower," Xu Yueping said.

Everyone agreed, finding it reasonable. Golden Rooster Ridge suffered heavy losses this time and urgently needed to replenish new cultivators.

Old Man Liu said, "Trouble's coming. Besides wanting people, they'll definitely demand money too. Recruiting new forces won't be cheap."

People's hearts felt heavy. The bandits of Golden Rooster Ridge had always put great pressure on the surrounding villages, a situation that had always been difficult to change.

Qin Ming and Old Man Liu entered the mountains. On the way, they still felt displeased and cursed the people of Golden Rooster Ridge together, believing them to be a gang of thieves from past to present.

"I really want to flatten Golden Rooster Ridge!" Qin Ming said.

"Don't say such things carelessly. It'll bring great disaster if someone hears you," Old Man Liu stopped him.

"Oh, right, old man, you said the high-level beings deep in the mountains have close ties with Crimson Cloud City's high-ranking officials. Is that true?"

Old Man Liu said, "Anyway, someone said it, but I don't know the specifics of its truth."

"Then why was there still the Great Rift Valley tragedy?" Qin Ming looked at the silent area ahead. Three days ago, many people and aberrants died there, and the valley was filled with the smell of blood.

"I reckon the aberrants' siege of the Great Rift Valley might not have been without a tacit understanding between both sides' higher-ups."

Qin Ming looked at him. "Why do you say that?"

Old Man Liu said, "There are more and more aberrants in the mountains, but there isn't as much territory. Some need to be consumed. And the great families in Crimson Cloud City have developed rapidly in recent years. According to traveling merchants, each family has its own monopolized industries. It would be inappropriate for the City Lord to directly suppress them. Now that the Great Rift Valley bloodbath has occurred, it seems to make sense."

"Grandpa Liu, you really dare to think!" Qin Ming glanced at him.

"When I was young, this old man also traveled to Crimson Cloud City. I know a lot about that place and have seen the world. If my foundation hadn't been torn apart by a famous beast in the mountains, I wouldn't be so down and out now."

The two walked and chatted.

After penetrating ten li into the mountain, Old Man Liu said, "No more talking. Once we're here, we can't mention those old monsters deep in the mountains."

After walking a bit further, they appeared in an ancient primeval forest and then arrived at the foot of a mountain.

"There's a fire spring inside this mountain," Old Man Liu said. Only someone with his extensive knowledge of the mountain would know about this place.

Furthermore, Old Man Liu had already scouted the path and knew that the fire spring here was affected by the chaotic geomagnetism in the mountain, causing it to become somewhat dim. This was one of the reasons he chose to act here.

Inside the mountain body was a nest of Silver-headed Ants, extremely dependent on the fire spring. Otherwise, in the severe cold, their activity would be severely reduced, and they wouldn't like to move.

From blood snakes to spiritual turtles, then long-armed gibbons, and now these Silver-headed Ants, Old Man Liu's chosen targets were all quite unconventional.

However, Qin Ming had to admit that this was indeed the best choice for now.

Silver-headed Ants were fierce, and their nest contained a terrifying number of them. Winter was the most suitable time to deal with them.

Another crucial reason was that there could only be one Ant Queen in the entire nest. Although there was enough spiritual substance to allow other Silver-headed Ants to undergo a third mutation, the Ant Queen wouldn't allow it.

Old Man Liu said, "Later, we'll need to get some steel plates to protect our bodies. Just wearing armor isn't safe. If a Silver-headed Ant bites you, while it won't kill you with venom, half your body will go numb for a long time. Once you're overwhelmed by them, you'll be bitten to death."

These Silver-headed Ants were far stronger than the black ants Xu Yueping used for tea. They ranged in size from a baby's fist to an egg, and were incredibly ferocious.

Their heads had silver markings, which gave them their name.

What was most remarkable about these ants was their ability to brew honey wine. They collected various pollen and wild fruits from the mountains, and even raided grain from outside the mountains, then, with the help of the fire spring's spirituality, they could brew a liquid that was like both wine and honey.

They could repeatedly extract the essence from the honey wine, allowing the concentrate to ferment again, repeatedly purifying it, and fermenting it multiple times. Finally, a special spiritual substance, a pale golden liquid, would be produced.

In some large cities, the honey wine brewed by Silver-headed Ants was astonishingly expensive, not to mention the spiritual substance fermented from the repeatedly purified essence.

Qin Ming and Old Man Liu followed a crack in the mountain, going deep inside to take a look. Qin Ming's scalp tingled a bit. By the dim fire spring, there were huge ants everywhere. Anyone with trypophobia would surely not be able to stand it here. The silver markings gleamed with a cold luster. At this time, they were completely motionless.

The two silently retreated, beginning to observe the surrounding terrain and plan their escape routes.

Over the next two days, they continuously entered and exited the mountains, bringing in all the necessary supplies.

"Success or failure rests on this single attempt!" In the icy world, white mist billowed from their mouths and noses as they prepared to act.

Qin Ming's mind was unsettled, not because of nervousness or fear. His thoughts were churning. If they succeeded here, after his third rebirth, when his fragmented memories resurfaced, what would he see this time?
