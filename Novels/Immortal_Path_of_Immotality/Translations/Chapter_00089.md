# Chapter 89: The Classification of Divine Abilities

Lin Shan never imagined that besides his wind spiritual root, he also possessed a thunder spiritual root. 

Could it be because he was struck by lightning when he crossed over?

"Since you're already practicing wind-based techniques, there's no need to switch to thunder-based ones. However, having a thunder spiritual root means you can still pair it with your wind root to unleash divine abilities without much issue," Lin Fan offered his professional opinion from the side.

Lin Shan pondered this before humbly asking, "Are there any techniques that can utilize both attributes simultaneously?"

"Techniques alone can't achieve that—it requires divine abilities," Lin Fan explained the difference between the two. 

"Techniques are merely superficial applications of a cultivator's spiritual energy, with limited efficiency. Their principles are shallow, their power scattered, and their conversion and consumption riddled with flaws. Since you only have wind spiritual energy in your body and no thunder energy, you naturally can't execute them."

"But divine abilities are different. They incorporate the use of spiritual energy from the heavens and earth, not just the energy within your body."

"How much spiritual energy can a cultivator's dantian hold compared to the boundless energy of the world? How can human strength contend with the power of nature?"

"Ordinary techniques are child's play, but once elevated to divine abilities, bolstered by the vast energy of heaven and earth, their power becomes unimaginable."

"Commonly seen are minor divine abilities, which utilize localized spiritual energy—essentially an upgraded version of techniques. Even these can split mountains, crack stones, and stir the clouds and rain. Wherever they manifest, seas of energy converge, unleashing overwhelming might."

"But the true divine abilities lie at a higher level. Unlike minor divine abilities, each of these can be considered a sect's foundational treasure—legendary arts passed down through the ages, capable of overturning rivers and seas or moving mountains to fill valleys!"

"And beyond those exist grand divine abilities, transcending spiritual energy to delve into the soul's potential. Locking souls across a thousand miles or shattering the void—these belong to realms beyond the Nascent Soul stage. Those rare, once-in-a-millennium figures who master them are known as Grand Divine Ability Practitioners!"

...

As Lin Shan absorbed this knowledge, he marveled at how much more disciples from major sects knew. With elders to guide them, their insight and perspective far surpassed their peers.

His "Seven Arrows Book of Nails" also belonged to the second tier—a foundational divine ability. Yet, according to the enhancement panel, it seemed to be merely a diluted version of an immortal art. No wonder it already possessed soul-locking capabilities across vast distances.

Recalling the eerie phenomena that befell the brocade-robed man after his curse, Lin Shan couldn't help but think back to the first time he activated the straw effigy—when he glimpsed across dimensions and saw that purple immortal artifact lying quietly in the void.

The true "Seven Arrows Book of Nails"—the origin of the immortal art.

"If I gain enough power in the future and find that void, I could claim that unowned immortal artifact. Then I'd truly wield an immortal art, cursing without limit—even immortals wouldn't be safe."

Excitement surged through him, but so did anxiety. What if he grew too slowly and someone else claimed the purple book first?

In his heart, that treasure already belonged to him.

Though currently just a fledgling Qi Condensation cultivator, his youthful ambition soared sky-high. Who wouldn't want to possess such a treasure when they saw it?

Meanwhile, Lin Fan watched him expectantly, clearly hoping for more questions to showcase his knowledge. Understanding his temperament, Lin Shan decided to humor him after his help earlier that night.

With feigned curiosity, he asked, "You have dual gold and thunder spiritual roots—how's your aptitude?"

Lin Fan's eyes lit up as he puffed out his chest. "Both are top-grade! In the main lineage of the Violet Heaven Sect, only two or three can compare!"

...

After chatting all night, Lin Shan finally satisfied Lin Fan's desire to show off and excused himself to a side chamber to recover his spiritual energy and essence blood.

Though the Bloodburn Talisman had been forcibly disrupted by the royal family's Foundation Establishment elder, he'd still lost some essence blood and needed recuperation.

A few days later, once mostly recovered, Lin Fan sought him out again, saying he planned to continue his travels to Jiangdong. With rumors of newly unearthed sect ruins there, he wanted to try his luck—and invited Lin Shan along.

Lin Shan's heart raced. Lin Fan, the so-called "Child of Fortune," stumbled upon treasures wherever he went, gathering opportunities effortlessly. Following him for some scraps wouldn't hurt!

Moreover, the "Joyful Buddha Statue" from Yichuan's auction had also been unearthed in Jiangdong. Tagging along might lead to benefits he needed.

Though he currently had 77 points of ancient essence, as a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator, he needed to consider Foundation Establishment. If he couldn't obtain a Foundation Establishment Pill, he might have to spend ancient essence to break through.

Post-establishment, he'd also need to upgrade his equipment and techniques.

For now, mid-grade magical tools sufficed at Qi Condensation. Against stronger foes like the royal Foundation Establishment elder, even high-grade tools wouldn't help much.

Besides, he was broke—earning some money wouldn't hurt. And with Lin Fan as a Violet Heaven Sect disciple, who would dare disrespect them? The sect wouldn't let its Qi Condensation disciples roam freely without confidence.

Now that both were late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators, as long as they didn't provoke Foundation Establishment experts, they'd be fine.

After discussing, they agreed and went to bid farewell to Lin Fan's senior brother, Lei Yunzi.

Lei Yunzi nodded, advising Lin Fan to be careful and telling Lin Shan not to worry about the royal elder.

After that night, the elder had gone somewhere and returned severely injured, his aura unstable and his cultivation on the verge of dropping. When Lei Yunzi inquired, the elder avoided details but showed him something.

Lin Shan immediately thought of the giant eyeball on the brocade-robed man's forehead and pressed for more information.

Lei Yunzi shook his head, saying their sect would send elders to investigate and that they should leave the capital soon—clearly unwilling to share more.

The matter was evidently significant, with potential far-reaching consequences if revealed.

Seeing his reluctance, the two prepared to depart.

Before leaving, Lin Shan considered dealing with Princess Guo but reconsidered. With the royal elder still in the capital, provoking him would be suicidal—even Left Realist's reputation couldn't save him then.

Plenty of time for that later. Let the little wretch live a while longer.

...

As cultivators, they traveled light.

Ready to depart, Lin Fan produced a miniature boat from his storage pouch. Tossing it into the air, it expanded into a twenty-foot azure-green flying vessel.

Seeing Lin Shan's astonishment, Lin Fan grinned. 

"This is a high-grade flying artifact I stumbled upon—rare even among Foundation Establishment cultivators! It consumes only half a spirit stone per thousand kilometers!"

"You have sword flight with spiritual sense; I have a luxury flying yacht. Care for a ride?"
