# Chapter 43: Lin Yun: "Are You Telling Me What to Do?" (1/3)

By a secluded mountain pond in the Huang Maple Valley, Chen Qiaoqian's pleas for mercy could be heard. Despite having reached Foundation Establishment, she was no match for Lin Yun in their sparring session. 

Of course, this was merely a friendly exchange—Chen Qiaoqian hadn't used the full power of the Darkwater Sword Lin Yun had gifted her, nor had she employed any talismanic treasures. In a true life-or-death battle, Lin Yun wouldn't have feared her either, armed as he was with his own talismans and Heavenly Thunder Beads.

"Great Fireball Technique!" 

With a thunderous boom, a blazing crimson fireball erupted from Lin Yun's mouth, glowing like a miniature sun before exploding dozens of meters away. The massive blast shattered boulders into fragments and carved a deep crater into the ground—a display of terrifying power. Fortunately, Chen Qiaoqian had surrendered in time, allowing Lin Yun to redirect the fireball toward a nearby rock.

"An elementary high-grade spell in my hands now rivals the destructive power of an intermediate-grade spell," Lin Yun mused with satisfaction. "The Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light truly has endless marvelous applications!"

The technique significantly amplified pure offensive spells—the more True Light he channeled, the greater the spell's potency.

Beside him, Chen Qiaoqian watched in stunned silence, her delicate frame glistening with sweat. "Brother Lin, the power of your spells might even surpass the spirit arts of the Mulan tribesmen from the Prairie!"

Spirit arts were the Mulan people's enhanced version of conventional spells. Lacking the abundant materials for crafting magic treasures found in the Tiannan region, they had focused on refining their spellcasting instead. As a result, their spirit arts far surpassed the spells of Tiannan cultivators, who preferred forging powerful magic treasures. Yet now, Lin Yun's elementary high-grade spells, infused with his True Light, exceeded even their spirit arts in power.

"Qiaoqian, you've grown too complacent," Lin Yun chided sternly.

"But with Brother Lin protecting me, why shouldn't I relax?" Chen Qiaoqian pouted, wrapping her arms around him. "I can just be your little woman, safe behind you." She nuzzled closer. "Brother Lin, my cultivation has slowed again. Won't you help me?"

Ever since discovering that dual cultivation with Lin Yun accelerated her progress, Chen Qiaoqian had become increasingly... enthusiastic about the practice. Each session left her utterly exhausted yet thoroughly satisfied. This unique benefit had only deepened her infatuation with him.

"Your progress is already remarkably fast," Lin Yun said with a frown. "In just one year, you're nearing the peak of early Foundation Establishment. Advancing too quickly will destabilize your foundation."

---

Lin Yun's brow furrowed slightly. The matter wasn't trivial—after all, who would believe that such activities could enhance cultivation? Had Chen Qiaoqian not experienced it firsthand, even she wouldn't have believed it possible.

"Besides, I have serious business to discuss with you today," Lin Yun said, his tone turning grave.

Noticing his displeasure, Chen Qiaoqian immediately straightened up obediently. She was utterly devoted to Lin Yun—without him, she felt she wouldn't survive.

"Brother Lin, go ahead."

Lin Yun handed her a storage pouch. "These are newly crafted talismans. Help me sell them and gather the materials listed in this jade slip." 

He was well aware of the Chen family's desire to benefit from him. As long as they proved useful, he didn't mind leveraging their resources. Cultivating his Five Dharma Bodies required an enormous quantity of elemental treasures—far more than he could collect alone. Sharing some profits to delegate the tedious work was a fair trade.

"New talismans?" Chen Qiaoqian's eyes sparkled with excitement and disbelief. "Brother Lin, can you already craft intermediate-grade talismans?!"

"My success rate is still low, but I can manage some simpler ones," Lin Yun replied ambiguously. "It should improve after reaching Foundation Establishment." 

His words weren't meant for Chen Qiaoqian but for the Chen family behind her. To secure their cooperation, they needed to see tangible benefits. These weren't true intermediate talismans but rather talismanic technique scrolls—just enough to whet their appetite and prevent them from losing hope. As for why he didn't produce more, his Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light was already stretched thin between cultivation, body refinement, and combat spells.

"Oh, and Qiaoqian," Lin Yun added as if remembering something, "ask if the Wanbao Pavilion has any talismanic treasures or Heavenly Thunder Beads. Buy them all if they do."

He had no shortage of such items himself—the real goal was to prevent Han Li from acquiring them. It had been nearly three years since he last "sheared" the protagonist, and his fingers were itching for another opportunity.

As for why he didn't also target top-grade magic artifacts: first, the Wanbao Pavilion likely had more in stock beyond the Ironwing Shield and Gold Devouring Blades that Han Li originally purchased; second, being too obvious would raise suspicions. Restricting the request to the rarer talismanic treasures and Heavenly Thunder Beads struck the right balance.

"Talismanic treasures? Heavenly Thunder Beads?" Chen Qiaoqian blinked in confusion. "Brother Lin, why do you need those? If you really want them, our Chen family can provide—"

"No," Lin Yun cut her off firmly. "Purchase them exclusively from Wanbao Pavilion."

Chen Qiaoqian pouted. "Okay..."

She assumed Lin Yun still resented past conflicts with her family and was avoiding further entanglement. Resolving to mend the rift, she vowed to ensure her father handled this matter flawlessly. While she'd choose Lin Yun over her family in any conflict, harmony between them would be ideal—especially since her mother remained with the Chens.

"But Brother Lin, why do you need those items? With your talismans, they seem unnecessary," she pressed.

"I'm entering the Bloody Trial."

"What?!" Chen Qiaoqian paled. "That's too dangerous! You already have our family's Foundation Establishment Pill—why risk the Forbidden Lands?"

Lin Yun arched an eyebrow. "Are you telling me what to do?" He gave her rear a firm squeeze. "Just follow my instructions and behave."

"With my strength and talismans, what is there to fear?"

The intimate contact melted Chen Qiaoqian's resistance, leaving her limp in his arms. "But—" Her protest was silenced as Lin Yun captured her lips. "To the lake. Consider this an advance payment."

"Be good."

Splash—!

The tranquil waters erupted in ripples and waves, concentric circles spreading outward like dragons returning to the heavens or giant turtles vanishing into the sea.

That night, the Chen family was thrown into uproar. Even their reclusive ancestral elder emerged from seclusion, his aged face crinkling with unrestrained joy as he examined the talismans.

"Excellent... Truly excellent!" he cackled, his laughter shaking the surrounding mountains. "Qiaoqian, you've brought our family an unparalleled blessing!"

"A genius! An absolute genius!" the elder raved. "A once-in-a-millennium talismanic prodigy has fallen into our laps! Crafting intermediate talismans at Qi Condensation? Unthinkable!"

"Grand Elder, there's more to Brother Lin's situation," Chen Qiaoqian interjected cautiously.

She relayed Lin Yun's request regarding the Wanbao Pavilion's talismanic treasures and Heavenly Thunder Beads.

"Why go to Wanbao Pavilion when we have those in our vaults?" the Chen family head blurted impatiently.

"Fool! Silence!" the ancestral elder roared, sending the man cowering into a corner.

Turning back to Chen Qiaoqian, the elder asked gently, "What's really going on?"

"I'm not certain," she replied, glancing meaningfully at her father.

"Why look at me? I didn't tell him to buy from Wanbao Pavilion!" the family head grumbled.

"Idiot! This is your doing!" the elder thundered. Though unspoken, he understood—Lin Yun still harbored resentment over past grievances.

Chastised again, the family head pouted indignantly. How was this his fault? This patriarch was truly reaching his limit!

"Effective immediately," the ancestral elder declared, stunning all present, "Qiaoqian shall assume leadership of the Chen family. Her word is my command!"
