# Chapter 207: Name Enters the Immortal Register

"Senior Brother, could it be that Master has returned?"

Zhang Jing suppressed his excitement, asking calmly, his voice imbued with a sense of certainty. Although he had been cultivating during this time, he hadn't forgotten to learn about the Daoist Ancestral Court.

As far as Zhang Jing knew, the Daoist Ancestral Court was located on Jade Splendor Mountain, the ancestor of all veins in the Pure Empyrean Profound Heaven. It was permeated with traces of Dao laws and even the Primordial Chaos Qi from when the Pure Empyrean Profound Heaven was first opened. Daoist disciples were generally forbidden from entering, lest they risk their bodies perishing and their Dao vanishing.

There were only two exceptions. One was when a Daoist Ancestor returned from the endless chaotic void, or when a True Monarch of Heavenly Immortals, on a whim, opened the Ancestral Court to preach the Dao. At such times, Daoist disciples would have an opportunity to enter the Ancestral Court. Of course, this was limited to the true disciples and the vast number of Dao Integration Realm disciples in the various blessed lands and Dharma realms of the Daoist Sect.

The second exception was—when a disciple advanced to become a true disciple!

Zhang Jing hadn't recently heard any news of an Ancestor returning or a True Monarch planning to preach. Thus, it was natural that Senior Brother Feng Wuyu bringing him to the Ancestral Court this time could only mean the second possibility.

Across from him, Feng Wuyu laughed. "Haha, that's right. All the Martial Uncles have arrived. Master specifically sent me to pick up Junior Brother and bring you to the Ancestral Court."

As he spoke, a hint of reminiscence flashed in Feng Wuyu's eyes, and he sighed with emotion, "Junior Brother, the scene of Senior Brother being sent to the lower realms to escort you to the Pure Empyrean Profound Heaven feels like it was just yesterday. Forty years, for us, is but a nap, yet I never expected Junior Brother to already be on the verge of becoming Master's formal personal disciple."

"Senior Brother, it's merely a matter of luck," Zhang Jing replied humbly.

"Luck? When you comprehended the Divine Sovereign's divine ability from that Immortal Blazing Sun in the core of the Soaring Cloud Secret Realm, causing that elder to take you as a half-disciple, was that also luck?" Feng Wuyu stared closely into his junior brother's eyes, a faint, unreadable smile gracing his lips.

"Hmm? Senior Brother, you—" Zhang Jing looked up, slightly surprised. He remembered not having mentioned becoming the Divine Sovereign's disciple to his senior brother. However, he immediately recalled how the spirit of that secret realm had called him "Young Master" repeatedly, and Zhang Jing felt a sense of relief.

"Haha, Junior Brother, no need to be surprised. The Karmic Fire Divine Token in your hand is the mark of a Divine Sovereign's disciple," Feng Wuyu said with a hint of envy. "With this item, when you enter the Dao Integration Realm and travel outside the domains, very few short-sighted divine beings will dare to provoke you. The Divine Sovereign's name, tsk tsk!"

As his words fell, Feng Wuyu seemed to recall something, and his expression suddenly turned serious. "Alright, Junior Brother, do you have any urgent matters at hand? If not, we should depart now. The journey by flight will take some time."

"Junior Brother has no urgent matters, merely troubling Senior Brother again," Zhang Jing said with a smile.

"Oh, you!" Feng Wuyu shook his head.

The next moment, a streak of bronze divine light shot straight into the sky, instantly vanishing from the Crimson Brightness Grand Purity Grotto-heaven.

...

On an immortal island not far from Zhang Jing, a deliberately lowered voice emerged only after the bronze divine light had disappeared from the Grotto-heaven.

"How strange! Why has Senior Brother Feng Wuyu of the Nine Domains Lineage appeared so frequently in the Grotto-heaven these past few months?"

"And even the Eldest Senior Sister has made a rare appearance."

"These two are both formal personal disciples of the True Monarch. Could something major be about to happen?"

"That Immortal Welcome Banquet—"

...

In the vast emptiness of the heavens, a highly inconspicuous bronze divine light sped rapidly towards the central region of the Pure Empyrean Profound Heaven, moving at an astonishing speed of tens of thousands of li per breath. Wherever it passed, wisps of bronze true intent spread out but were instantly cleared away by some power.

Inside the bronze divine light, Zhang Jing watched the rapidly receding scenery below without blinking. Vast territories seemingly fell completely into his view. Innumerable cities converged into endless nations, some populated by mortals, others by immortal kingdoms. Majestic immortal mountains, formed by intertwining earth veins, stretched endlessly, and rivers flowed ceaselessly for millions of li, emptying into countless lakes and boundless seas.

Across the boundless land were infinite ancient forests, plains stretching for billions of li, or deserts, or abysses. Among them, terrifying figures thousands of feet tall roamed the land, constantly warring. There were giant gods, immortal spirits, fierce beasts, and rare birds—a myriad of forms, each unique. Immortal light surged, piercing directly into the heavens.

What a magnificent spectacle of billions of beings striving for supremacy!

"This is the Pure Empyrean Profound Heaven, one of the Human Race's Seven Great Heavens?" Zhang Jing's eyes were filled with shock.

Beside him, noticing Zhang Jing's expression, Feng Wuyu patiently explained, "Junior Brother, below is the Eastern Pole Continent, one of our Pure Empyrean Profound Heaven's Five Continents, Four Seas, and Two Marshes. Senior Brother's Daoist sanctuary is located within it. Its area is incredibly vast, roughly equivalent to two and a half Juntian Domains in the lower realms."

"Just one continent can rival two and a half Juntian Domains?" Zhang Jing's gaze suddenly became slack.

...

After an unknown period, a majestic divine mountain came into view, piercing directly into the deepest part of the firmament, like a pillar supporting the sky, holding up the height between heaven and earth.

"We've arrived, Junior Brother," Feng Wuyu said with a smile. His words seemed calm, but his eyes were filled with awe. After all, that was the spine of the heavens, the ancestor of all veins.

Jade Splendor Mountain!

The next moment, the bronze divine light shot straight down.

...

Not long after, at the foot of Jade Splendor Mountain, Zhang Jing looked at the white jade staircase in his sight, which ascended straight into the sky and wound like a dragon, and asked in confusion, "Senior Brother, are we going to... climb up little by little?"

Hearing this, Feng Wuyu turned his head, a gentle smile appearing on his face, and said, "Indeed!"

"Junior Brother, this Jade Splendor Mountain is an ancestral vein, permeated with Dao laws, and many ancient rare auspicious beasts live within it. Flying up is not only difficult but also disrespectful to the Ancestral Court."

"You should follow closely behind Senior Brother. Don't fall too far behind."

As soon as he finished speaking, Feng Wuyu lifted his foot, like a mortal, and began walking up the white jade staircase step by step.

Seeing this, Zhang Jing, who was behind him, hurriedly followed, stepping onto the white jade staircase, wanting to catch up with his senior brother who was already walking away. However, as soon as he stepped onto the staircase, he felt something was off. A terrifyingly heavy pressure suddenly appeared, covering every part of his body. And as the staircase ascended, the pressure grew stronger, making every step Zhang Jing took incredibly difficult.

After an unknown period, on the white jade staircase, Feng Wuyu was still walking up step by step. Each step seemed to have been meticulously measured, and the time taken for each step was precise to the quarter-hour. Every movement was filled with a certain profound meaning.

Behind him, Zhang Jing followed closely. At this moment, his face had already turned ashen, and his breathing was heavy, like an old ox plowing a field. His steps were somewhat unsteady, making him look extremely disheveled.

"Hah...hah... Senior Brother, how much longer?" Zhang Jing asked with difficulty.

"Soon, Junior Brother, just hold on a little longer," Feng Wuyu said with a smile.

Upon hearing this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but roll his eyes. His senior brother had said the same thing three days ago. However, he didn't say anything more, just gritted his teeth, moved his trembling legs, and continued to ascend.

Suddenly,
ROAR—

A terrifying roar, imbued with a wild, primordial aura, echoed in his ears. Zhang Jing jolted, and from his body, which had already reached its limit, he managed to squeeze out another sliver of strength. His steps immediately became lighter.

...

Three days later.

"Junior Brother, we're here." Feng Wuyu slowly stopped.

Zhang Jing, whose consciousness was somewhat hazy, didn't answer. He simply looked up on his own. A magnificent and ancient bronze immortal palace appeared in his sight.

At the same time, a voice, clear as a spring, echoed in his ears. "Junior Brother Feng, and Junior Brother Zhang, you've finally arrived."

Zhang Jing couldn't help but follow the sound. He saw a shimmering white radiance slowly appear not far in front of him. Then, a graceful figure in a goose-yellow dress gracefully emerged from it. It was a woman, approximately twenty years old, with a smile in her eyes. As soon as she appeared, she immediately cast curious eyes towards Zhang Jing. Her smile was very clear, yet it gave Zhang Jing a faint sense of detachment, as if there was an invisible chasm between them.

As he pondered, Feng Wuyu suddenly spoke. "Thank you, Senior Sister, for coming to greet us." His tone held a politeness Zhang Jing had never seen before from him. Moreover, Zhang Jing also heard a hint of detachment in Senior Brother Feng Wuyu's words.

Seeing this, Zhang Jing also respectfully followed his senior brother's lead, bowing and calling out, "Many thanks, Senior Sister."

"Hmm, follow me," the Senior Sister in the goose-yellow dress nodded, her expression unchanged. After speaking indifferently, she walked directly towards the bronze immortal palace not far ahead.

"Junior Brother, this is Senior Sister Kong, Master's eldest personal disciple, the Third True Disciple of the Daoist Sect, and one of the leaders of the Heavenly Realm Lineage," Feng Wuyu's voice suddenly resonated in Zhang Jing's mind.

Upon hearing this, "The Heavenly Realm Lineage, Eldest Senior Sister? No wonder..." Zhang Jing immediately understood.

...

Half a quarter-hour later, as Zhang Jing and the two approached, the gates of the bronze immortal palace slowly opened.

BOOM—

Myriad rays of immortal light burst forth, then, as if sentient, instantly enveloped Zhang Jing and swept him into the immortal palace.

In place, Feng Wuyu and the woman in the goose-yellow dress calmly watched the scene unfold before them, looking as if they were accustomed to it.

"Senior Sister Kong, long time no see." Feng Wuyu was the first to break the silence.

"I didn't expect that after only three hundred years, Junior Brother's cultivation has progressed so greatly? It truly makes Senior Sister feel ashamed."

The woman in the goose-yellow dress said with a smile.

"Haha, any progress Wuyu has made today is all thanks to Junior Brother Zhang Jing. It's a pity that Senior Sister was in seclusion and missed such an opportunity."

Hearing this, the woman's expression subtly changed. A powerful, extreme energy fluctuation suddenly erupted from her body. On her exposed, fair skin, intricate four-colored Dao patterns faintly emerged, forming the shape of a flower, appearing alluring yet bizarre.

"Fifth Junior Brother, the Soaring Cloud Secret Realm? You entered the core of the secret realm?" the woman mused.

Feng Wuyu didn't directly answer, merely jested, "Senior Sister, I heard that in the Grotto-heaven, those junior brothers from your Heavenly Realm Lineage organized some kind of Immortal Welcome Banquet and specifically invited Junior Brother Zhang Jing, tsk tsk! I wonder what they were thinking."

"Oh, I forgot to mention, Junior Brother Zhang Jing now holds a Karmic Fire Divine Token."

After speaking, Feng Wuyu slowly took two steps back, standing ramrod straight before the bronze immortal palace gates, his eyes half-closed as if his mind was wandering beyond the heavens.

Across from him, Senior Sister Kong's brows furrowed tightly. "A bunch of fools, ignorant of what's good for them. If that's the case, then let Fifth Junior Brother teach them a lesson. When this matter is concluded, I will compensate Fifth Junior Brother."

"Oh, Senior Sister," Feng Wuyu suddenly opened his eyes at this, saying with a smile, "Fifth Junior Brother likes immortal roots and spiritual plants."

"I understand," she replied.

...

On the other side, within the bronze immortal palace, as soon as Zhang Jing entered, he saw the familiar figure seated at the very top. Then, the twelve terrifying figures exuding a majestic aura, like divine beings, on both sides of the hall, simultaneously came into view. Unconsciously recalling Senior Brother Feng Wuyu's instructions from earlier, Zhang Jing immediately understood. All these figures in the great hall were terrifying existences who had attained the Dao Fruit of a True Monarch of Heavenly Immortals and embarked on the path to immortality. In other words, they were his Martial Uncles.

Without the slightest hesitation, Zhang Jing knelt down directly. "Disciple Zhang Jing greets Master, and greets all Martial Uncles!"

In an instant, gazes filled with curiosity, appreciation, or gentleness gently fell upon Zhang Jing.

At the very top, True Monarch Yuanming laughed heartily. "Haha, Zhang Jing, come closer to me." He then gently waved a hand.

As his voice fell, Zhang Jing, who was still kneeling, suddenly felt as if his entire being, along with the surrounding space, was gently drawn away by an invisible great hand. The next moment, he found himself standing before his Master.

Before he could react, a grand Daoist voice resonated in his ears. "Zhang Jing, I ask you, are you willing to take me as your Master?"

"This disciple is willing!" As if understanding something profound, Zhang Jing's expression instantly became solemn, and he spoke earnestly. Then, he bowed deeply once more.

In the ethereal realm, a majestic fluctuation descended from the void, scanning Zhang Jing from inside out. In a trance, Zhang Jing felt as if his entire being had been completely seen through, from body to soul!

"How is there still this step? I hope nothing is discovered?" His breathing hitched, and his heart involuntarily trembled slightly. Zhang Jing hadn't forgotten that he was a transmigrator, and he also had that mysterious jade talisman in his Niwan Palace. He felt an urge to flee.

However, inside the bronze immortal palace, all the existences, including True Monarch Yuanming, had their gazes fixed on Zhang Jing, making him dare not even move, let alone escape.

Time passed by bit by bit. Although it was only a few breaths, in Zhang Jing's perception, it felt like several years, even decades. Never before had he felt as if his entire being was being roasted in a furnace, with every single breath being an immense torment.

Finally, that inexplicable fluctuation dissipated. Zhang Jing vaguely heard a cold, indifferent voice.

"Identity confirmed, Zhang Jing, Human Race of the Profound Yellow Realm!"

*Whoosh—*

He immediately let out a sigh of relief, his body almost collapsing.

And at this moment, True Monarch Yuanming's voice once again sounded in his ear. "Excellent! Let all Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters bear witness: from this day forward, Daoist disciple Zhang Jing officially enters my lineage, becoming my formal personal disciple."

"All of Zhang Jing's karma shall be borne by me alone."

"At the same time, my disciple Zhang Jing formally becomes a true disciple of the Yuanjun Lineage, shall enjoy the inheritance sequence, and his immortal name shall be recorded in the Golden Scroll and Jade Register."

"Congratulations, Senior Brother!" Twelve grand Daoist voices suddenly echoed within the bronze immortal palace.

"Zhang Jing, rise," True Monarch Yuanming said gently.

"Thank you, Master!" Zhang Jing respectfully said, then slowly stood up. His gaze unconsciously fell upon the Golden Scroll and Jade Register in his Master's hand. At first glance, it appeared unremarkable. However, upon a second look, he felt a strange sensation, as if he was peering into a vast world.

*Whoosh-lah-lah—*

Zhang Jing's gaze seemed to trigger a mechanism. The Golden Scroll and Jade Register began to flip rapidly, finally stopping on a blank golden page.

The next moment, accompanied by an invisible brush beginning to sketch, the two characters '张景' (Zhang Jing) slowly appeared on the golden page. In but an instant, Zhang Jing felt a subtle, almost imperceptible connection form between himself and an incredibly vast, incomprehensible existence.
