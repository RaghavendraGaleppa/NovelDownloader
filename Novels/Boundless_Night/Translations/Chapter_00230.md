**Chapter 230: Entering a Divine Dao Lineage**

Some once speculated, based on ancient records, that the heavens tilted northwest, the earth sank southeast, and the Night Mist World plunged into an abyss. Thus, the world became eternal night.

Huangsha City, located in the northwest at the intersection of the Qian and Rui great dynasties, had sparse vegetation. During the dry season, sand and stones flew everywhere, and sandstorms were even thicker than the night mist.

Qin Ming and Little Wu arrived by airship, gazing at the modest city before them. Its city walls weren't particularly high, built primarily from rammed earth mixed with water, making it essentially an earthen city. Normally, this place was far from bustling, but recently it had become remarkably lively. Numerous practitioners from various factions of the Outer Realm and Esoteric Sects had gathered, all seeking to explore the mysteries within the "Resurrection Lands" ahead.

As dusk deepened, the city's fire springs offered little illumination, casting a hazy glow on the streets. From a three-story wooden building, a beautiful woman waved, calling out, "Honored guests, please take your time, and welcome back next time."

A middle-aged man grumbled as he descended the stairs, "What Red-face Wine House? I'm never coming back! They promised century-old red-face wine, but it was just a century-old granny babbling at me. What a rip-off!"

The woman upstairs laughed and called out, "We also have 'Twenty-Eight Red-face Wine'!"

"I'm afraid I couldn't even finish twenty-eight jars, let alone get swindled again!" the middle-aged man retorted, walking away without a backward glance.

Qin Ming and Little Wu exchanged glances. They had been about to go upstairs but quickly retracted their steps.

"Don't leave, young sirs! That man just now didn't understand the rules. We operate fairly here, for young and old alike. Drinking is just an embellishment; selling information is our main business. Since you just entered through the city gate, you must want to know about the situation in this region, right?"

The two went upstairs and got straight to the point, seeking the latest news.

"Recently, the Kunling region, shrouded in dense fog, has become truly extraordinary. A dwelling place for immortals has appeared, stirring excitement among both the Immortal Path and the Divine Path practitioners..."

Soon, Qin Ming and Little Wu felt that the daylight gold they spent was well worth it. The Red-face Wine House provided very detailed information. Besides the ruins, there were also ancient great sects hidden in the mist. People from the current world could actually join their mountains, even if it felt dreamlike and they couldn't bring out their cultivation base. Still, this presented a valuable opportunity to test various methods, verify different cultivation techniques, and gain precious insights and experiences. Some even managed to bring out priceless scriptures.

"Are you Freshmen? The Freshman Path also has masters stationed in that area, so you can go with confidence."

The century-old granny, who turned out to be the proprietress and once Huangsha City's most beautiful woman, rambled on, providing the very latest intelligence.

Afterward, Qin Ming and Little Wu went to find lodging. The largest inns were out of the question, completely overflowing with people. During their search, they even ran into acquaintances. Indeed, it seemed Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan could be found anywhere. Whenever there was excitement or opportunity, these two were sure to be involved; they had arrived again. In addition, Qin Ming saw Zhuo Ya and Cao Wuji, who had chosen to join the Six Emperors Ancestral Court, and also spotted Lu Yuzhi of the Jade Purity Sect, indicating that even core disciples from the Freshman Path's top great sects had come.

"Sparrow!" Qin Ming recognized a familiar figure: Sparrow, who had come from Black and White Mountain, was following a Violet Lightning Beast.

Finally, he and Little Wu chose a guesthouse.

That evening, Qin Ming began to grasp the marvels of the Second Realm. At this level, his spiritual power had noticeably increased, and his Heavenlight could now commune with heaven and earth. In the Outer Saint domain, he needed to accumulate Dao profoundness, and more importantly, absorb malevolent energies (*sha*) and spiritual essences (*lingyun*) to enhance the power of his Heavenlight. These substances were often found in extremely perilous places.

The conventional approach was to absorb the Qi of the earth, the Qi of plants, and so on, but that would likely result in an overly gentle Heavenlight after its transformation. Some fused with nether *sha* or the azure Qi from beyond the heavens; when their Heavenlight burst forth, it would naturally be terrifying, immeasurably stronger than Heavenlight "fed" with conventional substances. Of course, many terrifying *sha* and "anomalous substances" (*yizhi*) were corrosive and detrimental to one's own body, even accelerating the depletion of one's lifespan the stronger they became. Therefore, the Second Realm emphasized balance. If one were too greedy for the immense power of Heavenlight, they might end up having a short life or even dying prematurely.

How to choose among *sha*, anomalous substances, and spiritual essences was a major dilemma. Both harmful and beneficial elements had to be present, but in strict proportions, making cultivation in the Second Realm very complex. Moreover, if one made a wrong choice, it could easily harm oneself, damage one's Dao profoundness, and severely diminish one's lifespan. In the Second Realm, one not only had to practice cultivation methods related to *sha* and anomalous substances but also cultivate life-nurturing techniques to maintain vitality, which was incredibly important.

Qin Ming felt that even if he didn't refine anomalous substances or fuse with rare Nine Heavens Pure Qi, and simply focused on accumulating Dao profoundness and breaking through normally, the quality of his Heavenlight would still be excellent. However, to become even stronger, he did need to consider drawing upon various extraordinary *sha* to make his Heavenlight more formidable.

"Are there any spiritual *sha* that don't diminish vitality and are harmless to the body?" he pondered, though he figured if such things existed, they would be incredibly difficult to find. After all, anything he could think of just upon entering the Second Realm, countless predecessors must have thoroughly researched.

Qin Ming took a deep breath. Now firmly in the Second Realm, he could already perceive spiritual substances naturally present between heaven and earth. At present, he wasn't ready to absorb anomalous substances or capture Nine Heavens Pure Qi, but he could draw upon normally existing beneficial factors to enhance his strength.

Moments later, Qin Ming's brows furrowed. He could clearly see some light particles captured by his Heavenlight, flowing within his body, but the efficiency was truly too slow. At this moment, he experienced the helplessness and pain of those who came before him. The speed of cultivation advancement through the conventional path of the Second Realm simply couldn't compare to that of the First Realm. If cultivating in the Freshman stage was like riding on the back of an exotic beast, flying swiftly, then now it was like riding a broken ox cart, bumping slowly forward.

Qin Ming knew he was powerful now, but he also realized the difficulty of the Outer Saint domain. He hadn't even started fusing with anomalous *sha*, and it was already this arduous. One must remember that his aptitude, root bone, and other qualities already far surpassed others on the Freshman Path, so riding an ox cart wasn't considered slow for him. However, the sheer gap compared to his previous cultivation speed was too vast.

"Should I use divine wisdom and spiritual consciousness as fuel to aid breakthroughs on the Freshman Path? Anyway, not much can be accumulated before it's ultimately fused, but even so, many problems remain."

That night, Qin Ming gazed into the path ahead, contemplating many things. Finally, he suddenly remembered something. Now that he was in the Second Realm, perhaps he could re-examine the tattered cloth to see if there were any new discoveries.

The tattered cloth had changed quite a bit; it was now slightly larger than three palms. The newly expanded area showed mountain shadows and a blurry ruined city, cut off by the cloth's edge. Qin Ming strongly suspected it was the Kunling Mountain Range and the legendary Jade Capital.

"Hmm?!" He was surprised. Today was different from before; as he investigated, the tattered cloth showed faint fluctuations, no longer completely lifeless. Immediately, Qin Ming released his Heavenlight and infused it into the cloth. The residual sun depicted on it instantly became incredibly dazzling, but that was all; it was brighter than before, but showed no extraordinary capabilities. Soon, he knew where the change had occurred. After his breakthrough, his spiritual power had surged, and the nascent "light of the soul" unique to Freshmen had begun to emerge, growing with his cultivation. It was this light that caused the cloth to fluctuate.

"Does it require a stronger spiritual power than in the First Realm to activate?" Qin Ming attempted.

Indeed, the tattered cloth fluctuated again, but still wouldn't yield to his command, making him so frustrated he almost wanted to tear it apart. However, it was woven from exotic metals, and its colors were now more vibrant than before, with several new types of exotic metal materials, making it appear even more sturdy and indestructible.

"This is..."

Suddenly, Qin Ming was startled. As he tried to activate it with his spiritual power, one of his hands unintentionally passed through the tattered cloth. It had finally become somewhat different!

The tattered cloth still didn't display astonishing divine power; it remained "peaceful," completely unlike the "torrential might" Qin Ming had initially envisioned. However, it could now be used for... storage. Although it currently only had a space of a few cubic meters, it exceeded his expectations and was a pleasant surprise. Such items could be refined in the Outer Realm, but they were far from widespread.

Qin Ming placed a daylight gold coin inside. The next morning, he checked it immediately and found it was still there, without any negative changes like corrosion.

"No more packing large bags of luggage from now on," he smiled. He had long carried his jade-iron blade and bow and arrows, not to mention his change of clothes. Moreover, every time he fought, he feared his gold notes would be damaged. Now, the gold notes on him were worth over ten thousand daylight gold, a considerable fortune. If they were to burst open, it would truly be a waste of effort, leaving him nowhere to cry.

After breakfast, Qin Ming and Little Wu immediately set off. This time, they felt quite confident, not only because both had reached the Second Realm, but also because there were senior Freshmen masters in the resurrected lands. The journey was filled with overwhelming sandstorms, making it quite unpleasant. Fortunately, upon entering the Kunling region where black mist billowed, the yellow sand vanished, leaving only desolation. Following the map obtained from the Red-face Wine House, they proceeded smoothly.

Eventually, the two gazed at their destination, somewhat lost in thought. Before them lay vast expanses of ruins and dilapidated buildings, densely packed, as if they had arrived in a massive ancient city. Moreover, some structures clearly had silver runes swirling around them, accompanied by chanting sounds, appearing incredibly divine. The reason why practitioners from the Immortal Path and Esoteric Sects had flocked here recently was precisely because of these extraordinary phenomena. Qin Ming and Little Wu had already learned the true nature of this place: attempting to directly comprehend the scriptures here was difficult; one could only obtain fragmented pieces. The correct "way to open" this place was to enter the mist, join a mountain sect, and seek tutelage!

Everything seen before them was merely an illusion; within lay another universe, as if an ancient immortal's mansion, shrouded in dense fog, stretched across this land. In the early days, even immortal seeds like Cui Chonghe and Su Shiyun had found no success here, until they entered and exited through a spiritual wandering method, joining the ancient great sects, only then did they gain anything. When this news spread, it caused a sensation, attracting countless aspiring disciples.

However, joining these ancient great sects in this manner was not without danger. Currently, some individuals from both the Esoteric Sect and the Immortal Path were trapped, unable to return to reality. It was said that some became too deeply immersed, as if they were being assimilated into antiquity. Previously, Qin Ming had thought their true bodies were trapped in the ruins, but only at the Red-face Wine House did he learn that it was their divine wisdom (*shenhui*) and spiritual consciousness (*yishi lingguang*) that had become lost.

"There are even demons here!" Little Wu exclaimed.

Along the way, they saw not only many people but also strange beings, and even one stronghold was occupied by a great demon. Qin Ming warned, "Don't speak carelessly. Only those hostile to us are called demons. Those we can coexist with are called anomalous beings, and those with closer ties can be referred to as the Sacred Elephant Clan, Immortal Fox Clan, and so on."

After several periods of pioneering, there were still many anomalous beings on the land where humanity resided, naturally due to their ability to coexist. There was a saying that in the earliest times, when humanity was weak, it was thanks to anomalous beings who took human form that they repelled giant beasts and terrifying plants rooted in the clouds.

Soon after, Qin Ming not only discovered strongholds of the Outer Realm and gathering points of the Esoteric Sect but also saw senior masters from the Freshman Path. People from the Six Emperors Ancestral Court had arrived; those old men were all skin and bones, ancient in years, with only a few strands of hair left on their heads. Some whispered that the Young Patriarch of the Six Emperors had personally come to oversee things here! It was also heard that direct disciples of Patriarchs from the Immortal Path and Esoteric Sects had arrived. With such a group of high-level masters present, this place, already outside the scope of the Yin Lands and suspected to be related to immortals and gods, had most of its not-so-numerous monsters cleaned out.

Shortly after, Qin Ming and Little Wu were delighted to find two more familiar figures: the two senior masters from the Mountain River Academy's Freshman Path, Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan. A group of students had also gathered here, including Tang Jun, Qian Chuan, Xin Youdao, Liu Hanya, and others—all acquaintances.

"Shen Wubing, Wu Yaozu, it's good that you two are safe!" Yu Gensheng was overjoyed. These were future patriarch-level figures he had placed great hopes on.

"Seniors, what's the situation with Kunling City?" Qin Ming asked.

Zhao Ziyuan shook his head. "We don't know. We also left at the last moment. That city has completely lost contact."

Xin Youdao, Liu Hanya, and others warmly greeted them, being those who knew Qin Ming and Little Wu's background. Qin Ming asked them for details about the place, how to enter the mist, and join the ancient great sects.

"Immortal Path practitioners can enter by spiritual wandering. If they encounter danger, they can instantly detach from that state and automatically return. It's similar for Esoteric Sect practitioners if they use divine wisdom," Yu Gensheng explained.

"Only Freshmen need to enter in their physical bodies, and they must reach the Second Realm, where their spiritual power undergoes a qualitative change, their light of the soul erupts, and their minds are highly concentrated, to be able to go in."

"What benefits can Freshmen gain there?" Qin Ming asked.

"It's very frustrating! Do you know what identity you'll assume once you enter? You'll play the role of a Force Warrior!" a hot-blooded young man indignantly said.

"A Force Warrior serving ancient immortals?" Qin Ming was surprised.

Another young man added, dissatisfied, "That's right! After we go in, to put it nicely, we're people by the immortals' side. To put it bluntly, we're attendants!" He was indignant that even such an exploration and joining an ancient great sect was full of discrimination.

"Those Force Warriors are different from us," Yu Gensheng shook his head. He explained that those Force Warriors were subordinates whose cultivation was boosted by god-like beings or or near-immortal creatures; they hadn't forged their own paths. Some Force Warriors were even "ripened" by powerful beings using great divine abilities. In some cases, these Force Warriors were essentially disposable, created by inscribing runes into their flesh and ultimately branded with slave marks.

"If it's not our path, then what are we going in for?" Qin Ming frowned.

Zhao Ziyuan said, "Of course, you don't need to learn the process of how Force Warriors are refined, but some of the medicinal concoctions are very important. You can write them down; they are of immense benefit to Freshmen's physical bodies."

Qin Ming felt that the two elders were acting a bit desperately. Those medicinal concoctions weren't necessarily miraculous elixirs; how valuable could something given to servants be?

Yu Gensheng said, "Take a close look; there might be something worth learning from."

Qin Ming frowned, "Some prominent figures on the Immortal Path have always been obsessed with having people from our Freshman Path serve as their guardians, even wanting to subdue patriarch-level figures to be their Force Warriors. Could it be that they are influenced by ancient immortals?"

Zhao Ziyuan nodded, "Indeed. In fact, the Immortal Path, Esoteric Sect, and others have largely inherited parts of the ancient immortal and divine orthodoxies, though they are not entirely the same. They have forged their own paths, and everything here is very suitable for them, complementing their own ways."

Little Wu chimed in, "They might not have inherited all the abilities, but they certainly haven't left out any of the bad habits!"

Xin Youdao, Liu Hanya, and others felt awkward. As individuals who either cultivated both paths or solely the Immortal Path, it seemed they had been implicitly scolded. Both wanted to say that they had never put on such airs.

Qin Ming decided to personally 'immerse himself' to see what the situation truly was and if there were any opportunities or fortunes he needed. With the senior Freshmen masters present, he had no worries.

Yu Gensheng warned, "Absolutely do not become too immersed. Some people get so absorbed that their spiritual consciousness is assimilated after entering, and they might never return."

Qin Ming nodded and strode towards the misty area deep within the architectural ruins. This time, Little Wu acted separately. Qin Ming's inner rainbow light left his body; he intended to enter using a spiritual wandering method similar to those of the Immortal Path disciples.

Qin Ming's mind was highly focused. After reaching the Second Realm, his spiritual power had indeed soared by a large margin. Soon, the world he saw was different. Even in ancient times, this region was probably extraordinary.

The black mist dispersed, revealing a scene of fragrant flowers and singing birds, like an immortal pure land from a painting, bathed in brilliant light, with clusters of exotic flowers blooming and various spiritual trees growing. Moreover, this region had more than one mountain gate; there were extraordinary places in different directions, each with surging immortal mist, flowing auspicious glow, and swirling purple Qi.

He chose a mountain gate that appeared grand in scale, its aura astonishing, with auspicious Qi forming divine beasts and immortal birds circling in mid-air. During this process, Qin Ming felt like an observer, as if he were experiencing someone else's past. He paid respects to the mountain, became a handyman disciple, worked hard, and then had hopes of becoming an outer disciple, but was tested and found unsuitable for the Immortal Path, suggested to pursue the path of a Force Warrior.

He was somewhat entranced; all of this unfolded rapidly. His bodily instincts told him that not much time had passed in reality, yet nearly a month had gone by here.

"Did someone experience this, and have I temporarily replaced them? No, this is still my own body. Hmm, perhaps I've been temporarily granted the perspective of some ancient Force Warrior? If so, this could also be a form of cultivation, a grand dream here to temper myself?" Qin Ming speculated.

Since his true body had entered, he naturally wouldn't be content with mediocrity. Just as he was about to become a Force Warrior and an Immortal Path disciple was about to inscribe runes within his body, he rebelled, sending the immortal family disciple flying with a single slap.

"Challenge successful, become an Inner Disciple," a voice announced.

"That works too?" Qin Ming was surprised. In ancient immortal sects, was strength paramount? Could even Force Warriors challenge Inner Disciples? Perhaps he had found a loophole; after all, this wasn't a true ancient world, he was merely immersed in a role, temporarily participating in a scenario.

Qin Ming wandered around the immense mountain gate, preparing to search for genuine immortal Dao prescriptions. Having come this far, why would he want Force Warrior elixirs? He didn't need inferior products!

Soon, he spotted familiar faces—Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan. Qin Ming's expression was blank. How was it that he ran into these two every time he went on an adventure?

"You're a Freshman Path person, here to be a Force Warrior? Come, follow me," Zheng Dazhuang called out, adopting a high and mighty posture, as if he had truly returned to ancient times and wanted to command servants.

*Bang!*

Qin Ming walked over and 'sent him off' with a single slap. It wasn't that Zheng Maoze was weak. This time, Qin Ming went all out, wanting to test just how powerful an Outer Saint's palm strike truly was! Zheng Maoze exploded, his spiritual wandering consciousness shattering into a rain of light, but it was then reassembled by a mysterious force and sent out of the area.

Outside, Zheng Dazhuang's head was still ringing. What was going on? Had he seen a ghost? Just one slap, and he was blown apart!

Qin Ming confirmed that this was a trial ground left by the ancient great sect for its disciples, and the most basic requirement was to ensure their safety.

Zeng Yuan, that acquaintance, was typically unreliable, a fair-weather friend. Seeing Zheng Maoze's predicament, he turned and fled. Obviously, he couldn't escape either. He was struck by a full-power kick from Qin Ming, disintegrated mid-air, and returned as a rain of light.

"Qingxu, Senior Brother Li, you must stand up for me! Dammit, a Freshman Path person, or maybe even an ancient Force Warrior, blew me up!"

Outside, Zheng Maoze was complaining and seeking help. He even considered inviting a more powerful immortal seed like Sun Jingxiao; he felt utterly humiliated.

Qin Ming ignored all this. He strolled through this pure land of the great sect. As an Inner Disciple, he gained access to some important secret manuals and even obtained several valuable prescriptions.

"This is the correct choice for Freshmen once they enter. Why play the role of a Force Warrior? Either don't do it at all, or if you do, do it to be the strongest, the best, the supreme."

Qin Ming felt it was necessary to further elevate his status. A mere Inner Disciple wasn't enough; he should at least be a core disciple, right? Were there even higher statuses? Like a Young Sect Master, for instance? He just didn't know if the high-status disciples here had already been replaced by those Immortal Path disciples from the current world.

Qin Ming didn't concern himself with these thoughts and walked towards the vital areas of the great sect, preparing to challenge and obtain a distinguished status and precious resources according to the rules here.

"Hmm?!"

In a blazing red forest where maple leaves fluttered everywhere, Qin Ming stopped. He had discovered a very strong opponent. It was a woman in purple robes, with waist-length black hair, an ethereal aura, distant, elegant brows, an exquisitely delicate oval face, and eyes like autumn water.

"Is this an ancient person, or an Immortal Path disciple from the current world spiritual wandering? She seems very strong," Qin Ming stared at her.

Immediately, he spoke, "Please enlighten me!" Then, he attacked first.

The woman showed a peculiar expression. Immortal light surged, unleashing astonishing power fluctuations, and her spiritual consciousness, imbued with pure Yang attributes, charged like a cascading galaxy. Qin Ming wielded his blade, his five-colored blade humming, its light resplendent. He was greatly surprised. An Immortal Path disciple in the Second Realm could actually clash head-on with his blade? Normally, his five-colored blade, forged from his Heavenlight energy as fierce as the blazing sun, should instantly incinerate the opponent's spiritual consciousness.

The woman was even more shocked. "Who are you? Among my generation, who can withstand a single strike from me? Especially since you are merely a Force Warrior! There's no such person in the world!"

"An ancient person?" Qin Ming felt a sense of unreality. Had he become too immersed in the role? Why did he feel that the spiritual consciousness he encountered wasn't even slightly illusory?

At the same time, deep within this great sect, a crystal coffin slowly opened a crack. A woman lay inside, her skin like ice and bones like jade, and suddenly opened her eyes.
