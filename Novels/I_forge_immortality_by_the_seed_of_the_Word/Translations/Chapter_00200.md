# Chapter 197: Young Master, Please Stay

"With only two or three months left, there's insufficient time to gain further insights from this Immortal Sun," Zhang Jing mused silently as he sat cross-legged atop the mountain peak.

The six-layered Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud above him gradually descended, transforming into a divine light that returned to dwell peacefully within his muddle palace.

His consciousness followed the auspicious cloud immortal seed back to the muddle palace, where his gaze instinctively fell upon the mysterious jade talisman at its center.

[Immortal Seeds:]
[Ninth-grade Immortal Seed: Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud]

[Magic Seeds:]
[Supreme-grade Magic Seed: Moonlight Dragon Devours Qi]
[Mid-grade Magic Seed: Treasure River]
[Mid-grade Magic Seed: Nine Evolutions Primordial Spirit Seal]

[Cultivation Methods:]
[Primordial Beginning Realm - Level 1 (4,197/1,000,000)]
Skill Trait: Dao Fusion Creation (Immortal)

[Supreme Crimson Karma Demon-Slaying Saber - Uninitiated (0/100,000)]

"So the jade talisman classified this inheritance as a cultivation method?" A flicker of surprise crossed Zhang Jing's eyes before quickly fading.

Upon reflection, the Supreme Crimson Karma Demon-Slaying Saber indeed qualified as a cultivation method, somewhat similar to the ancient immortal path of the Primordial Beginning Realm—both involved refining a life-bound treasure. However, this divine ability was limited to a specific weapon.

Though it couldn't match the near-infinite possibilities of the Primordial Beginning Realm's ancient immortal path, the terrifying power of that demonic saber spoke for itself. Which was superior depended on perspective. For those of average aptitude, the Supreme Crimson Karma Demon-Slaying Saber would undoubtedly be more suitable.

Zhang Jing's gaze shifted slightly, landing on the staggering experience values beside the skills—100,000 and 1,000,000. A wave of dizziness washed over him.

"Another experience sinkhole, on top of the Primordial Beginning Realm... The fifty billion luck points from participating in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm still won't be nearly enough. Wait—after returning to the sect, I still need to purchase and upgrade the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability." Darkness momentarily clouded his vision.

Before long, Feng Wuyu's figure appeared nearby.

"Junior Brother, you—" Feng Wuyu's voice, tinged with astonishment, disbelief, and joy, abruptly cut off as he sensed the lingering aura of the Karma Fire Dao emanating from Zhang Jing. The answer was clear.

There was no need to ask further—the unfamiliar true intent fluctuation he'd detected earlier was undoubtedly a trace of his junior brother's comprehension of the Divine Lord's fundamental Karma Fire Dao.

Feng Wuyu exhaled slowly, his gaze toward Zhang Jing now filled with awe. The Karma Fire Dao, through which the Seven Desires Divine Lord had attained the Golden Immortal Dao Fruit, had been grasped by his junior brother, yielding a trace of true intent divine ability inheritance? Such an inconceivable event had unfolded right before his eyes.

At this moment, Feng Wuyu began to understand why their master had prepared such a gift for Zhang Jing. "Was all of this within your calculations, Master?" he wondered silently.

Meanwhile, the Secret Realm Spirit materialized, freezing in place. Like Feng Wuyu before it, one glance at Zhang Jing told it everything.

"My lord's Great Dao... my lord's Great Dao..." The spirit repeated inwardly, its face a picture of incredulity mixed with reverence. It no longer questioned how a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator could achieve this. Instead, another issue presented itself: the core area of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm had always been its master's testing ground. By tradition, Zhang Jing, having comprehended a trace of its master's Great Dao inheritance, should be considered his disciple—addressed as "Young Master."

Yet, Zhang Jing clearly couldn't be its master's disciple. The spirit's thoughts were in turmoil, uncertain how to proceed. This was the first time it had encountered such a situation.

As time passed, Feng Wuyu composed himself and smiled warmly at Zhang Jing. "Junior Brother, congratulations! I merely mentioned it in passing, yet you truly managed to comprehend a true intent divine ability inheritance from the Divine Lord's Karma Fire Dao."

From the other side, the Secret Realm Spirit also offered congratulations, its tone now carrying newfound respect. "Young—Zhang Jing, congratulations!" It barely caught itself before the title "Young Master" slipped out, averting potential embarrassment.

Rising to his feet, Zhang Jing smiled in response. "Haha, I owe my insights entirely to Senior Brother's guidance." He then turned to the spirit. "And to Proud Cloud's assistance—I'm deeply grateful."

"Think nothing of it—just a trivial favor," the spirit replied with an enthusiastic wave.

After exchanging pleasantries, Feng Wuyu eagerly pulled Zhang Jing aside to discuss their respective insights from contemplating the Immortal Sun. His intention wasn't to pry into the specifics of Zhang Jing's Karma Fire Dao inheritance but simply to satisfy his curiosity about his junior brother's extraordinary comprehension abilities.

As a disciple of Yuanming True Monarch, Feng Wuyu understood better than anyone that the inheritances of such mighty beings couldn't be lightly studied—or even learned—without sufficient affinity or explicit permission from the original masters.

"Senior Brother seems to have gained much from this experience," Zhang Jing remarked.

"Ah, I benefited from your presence—consider this a debt I owe you, Junior Brother!" Feng Wuyu laughed heartily.

"Senior Brother exaggerates."

Watching their retreating figures and catching snippets of their conversation, the gradually fading Secret Realm Spirit wore an expression of bewilderment. "What does this mean? Could it be that my master's decree was primarily intended for Foundation Establishment cultivator Zhang Jing... rather than Unity Realm Immortal Feng?"

...

In the distant outer realms, Yuanming True Monarch chuckled. "Divine Lord, does my disciple's aptitude meet your standards?"

Having witnessed Zhang Jing successfully comprehend a formidable divine ability from the Seven Desires Divine Lord's fundamental Karma Fire Dao, Yuanming was in high spirits.

Beside him, the Seven Desires Divine Lord nodded approvingly. "That Auspicious Cloud... It seems this youngster carries immense fortune to have encountered such a remarkable opportunity. Though its grade remains low, its conceptual foundation is profound—it may well evolve into a complete Great Dao, enabling him to attain the Golden Immortal Dao Fruit."

Yuanming suddenly smiled meaningfully. "Divine Lord, this youngster has now inherited your fundamental Karma Fire Dao. Though he's my disciple, he's also half yours now."

After a brief pause, the Seven Desires Divine Lord burst into laughter. "Haha, so this was your scheme all along, Zhenyang!" Yet he soon nodded in agreement. "Very well. That he could learn the Supreme Crimson Karma Demon-Slaying Saber—albeit with the Auspicious Cloud's aid—demonstrates a connection with me. We share a partial master-disciple bond."

...

Shortly after, the Secret Realm Spirit, as if sensing something, prostrated itself and reverently received an edict with outstretched hands. The next instant, its pupils contracted as it exclaimed in shock, "Young Master? Zhang Jing!"

...

Three months passed in a flash.

On a mountain peak, Zhang Jing and Feng Wuyu rose simultaneously, both wearing satisfied smiles—clearly pleased with their respective gains.

With a resounding boom, a heavy, ancient stone gate materialized before them, revealing glimpses of the plaza outside the Proud Cloud Secret Realm. Only a few dozen cultivators stood there, a stark contrast to the bustling crowds from three years prior when the secret realm had opened.

"Finally, time to return. Junior Brother, if you've no other plans, why not accompany me back to the sect?" Feng Wuyu suggested warmly.

"I'd be honored, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied gratefully.

"Between fellow disciples, there's no need for formalities."

Just then, the Secret Realm Spirit appeared behind them and called out urgently, "Young Master, please stay!"
