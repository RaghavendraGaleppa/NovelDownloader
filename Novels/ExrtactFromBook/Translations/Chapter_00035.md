# Chapter 35: Departure

Luo Xiaoyao always claimed Han Yue was her benefactor, but was she not also Han Yue's own serendipity?

The past year had been one of rapid growth for Han Yue. By Luo Xiaoyao's side, he had not only amassed considerable wealth and obtained an entry token but also gained extensive knowledge about cultivation through their daily interactions.

More importantly, Luo Xiaoyao had demonstrated through her actions the mindset and bearing expected of a true disciple from a major sect—or in cultivator terms, the "Dao Heart." Her positive attitude and unwavering determination deeply moved Han Yue, leaving an indelible mark that would guide his future cultivation journey, helping him maintain focus and correct his path.

They talked through the night, free from the pressures of hunting for profit, both more relaxed than ever. Han Yue went all out, roasting an entire ox to satisfy Nailv's appetite. As the sun rose, Luo Xiaoyao bid farewell, seated atop the Scarlet-Horned Python's head as the serpent carried her eastward without a backward glance.

Han Yue, too, took to the skies, returning to Flesh-Dividing Market. He avoided meeting anyone, heading straight to his quarters to begin another period of seclusion. After a year of intense hunting, he needed time to rest and thoroughly assess his cultivation progress. He had already decided: once the upcoming Dharma Assembly concluded, he would leave Flesh-Dividing Market to seek his own path to the Dao.

Focusing inward, Han Yue observed the Celestial Origin Treasure Lotus in his dantian, steadily producing pure primordial qi. This third divine ability, hidden within him and unknown to others, was the cornerstone of his rise. It allowed him to hunt freely without worrying about energy sources, though attempts to understand its origins proved futile given his current knowledge and cultivation stage.

The Body-Nurturing Thunder runes enveloped the lotus, refining and absorbing its pure qi, converting it into thunder-based mana that nourished Han Yue's body. After a year of cultivation, these runes had surpassed the first Great Perfection by an additional three hundred, nearing a second Great Perfection. Once achieved, his capacity for mana refinement and storage would increase significantly. With the lotus's support, Han Yue was building an exceptionally solid foundation through the Body-Nurturing Thunder technique. His youth and physical potential might even allow him to push this technique to unprecedented heights.

Despite a year of frequent use, Han Yue's two major divine abilities showed little improvement in proficiency. He accepted this—his current stage, mana, and cultivation simply couldn't support mastering higher-tier abilities. As his strength grew, so too would his control over them. For now, further refining these abilities would be wasteful. Instead, he resolved to focus entirely on *Body-Nurturing Thunder* until the Dharma Assembly, aiming for the second Great Perfection.

According to Luo Xiaoyao's framework of Dharma, Techniques, Body, and Artifacts, Han Yue excelled in Techniques to such an extent that most assumed he had already reached the second stage. Even Luo Xiaoyao hadn't realized he hadn't advanced yet. His three extraordinary divine abilities formed a complete combat system. However, his lack of heritage left him lacking in the other three aspects, creating a disparity with his actual combat prowess. This was why Han Yue planned to embark on a journey to seek the Dao soon.

### **A Visitor Arrives**  
While Han Yue immersed himself in cultivation, a knock interrupted his solitude.  

"Brother Blade, are you there? The merchant company is looking for you!"  

It was Xiao Liu, accompanied by Xiao Qing. Having reached the Foundation Establishment stage at his age, Xiao Liu had become a capable young man, his bloodline mana flourishing and his physique strengthened. As a core member of the hunting team in Celestial District's Ninth Courtyard, he had chosen bladework under Han Yue's influence.  

Xiao Qing bowed slightly. "Master Han, regarding your request to exchange all your merchant coins for spirit stones—the amount exceeded my authority, so I couldn't fulfill it earlier. My apologies. I’ve now obtained full authorization and came to inform you. Additionally, our company's master has taken an interest in your transactions and wishes to meet you."  

Han Yue considered briefly before nodding. "Very well. I’d be honored. My schedule is open—please arrange it."  

After Xiao Qing departed, Xiao Liu stayed to chat before leaving as well.  

Han Yue was deeply curious about the merchant company's master. Over time, he had come to understand their business model: controlling trade routes to monopolize demon beast resources near the outer regions, issuing their own currency to dominate financial settlements, and offering unparalleled services to amass staggering profits.  

Having operated for over a millennium, the company's accumulated wealth was unimaginable. To Han Yue, they were an unfathomable power—and their master, who commanded this colossal entity, intrigued him greatly. He looked forward to their meeting.
