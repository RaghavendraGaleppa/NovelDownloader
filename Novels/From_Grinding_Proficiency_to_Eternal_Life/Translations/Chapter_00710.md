# Chapter 710: Wukong Bears the Hardship

A chilling light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. Seizing the moment when the White-Haired True Lord was momentarily stunned by Tong Xuan's death, he commanded his Wukong clone to strike with full force.

The revived Starry Banner, fueled by the lingering stellar power, unfurled. The three hundred and sixty-five main stars on its surface blazed once more. Countless purple-gold divine thunders intertwined into a net, carrying the destructive true intent of the Celestial Thunder as they roared toward the White-Haired True Lord.

The nature of the thunder changed in an instant—Taiyi Clear Source Demon-Cleansing Thunder, Zhouheaven Dipper Pivot Rending Golden Armor Thunder, Earthly Fiend Abyssal Divine Thunder... The myriad forms of thunder rotated and countered each other, completely locking down the space around the White-Haired True Lord.

"Tricks!" the White-Haired True Lord rasped with a sneer. Beneath his gray robe, his skeletal hands flew through hand seals.

His body suddenly turned ethereal, transforming into a wisp of gray-white mist that merged with the churning dead energy of the Sea of Bitterness. The net of lightning pierced through the mist, but it was like striking a phantom, only evaporating a wave of blood into a void.

The gray mist reformed a hundred yards away. The White-Haired True Lord's face turned a shade paler, but the wound pierced through his shoulder by the rain of swords miraculously healed as if it had never been.

"Life and death cycle, yin and yang reversed," the White-Haired True Lord said, looking up slightly. "Xu Yunfan, no matter how powerful your thunder is, in other places, I might have been helpless. But in this Netherworld, you cannot break my law."

Xu Yunfan's mind raced, glancing at the notification that had popped up on his attribute panel.

*'Your attack seems to have greatly reduced effect on the White-Haired True Lord's Nine Nether Samsara Secret Technique.'*

Realizing the attack was ineffective, Xu Yunfan decisively abandoned the fight with the White-Haired True Lord. Although Tong Xuan's Sword Soul had been shattered, a thread of his immortal golden nature was still protecting his remnant soul as it rushed toward the direction of the Netherworld. He was clearly using his immortal nature to protect his true spirit and escape into reincarnation.

To kill a self-dismembered Tong Xuan, who was left with only a soul, was already a stroke of luck. Now, he should be aiming for the real target. It was simply not worth spending any more time缠斗 with this White-Haired True Lord.

He had to sense the properties of the Taiyin Qilun Dao Fruit first.

"Go!"

Xu Yunfan controlled Wukong, transforming him into a molten golden light that tore through the blood waves and charged straight at the White Bone Island.

On the gnarled, strange tree atop the Qilu's head, the Taiyin Nether Qilun Dao Fruit flowed with a clear luster. The fruit, with its scale-patterned dragon form, emitted a supreme yin and cold Dao rhythm, yet it concealed a sliver of life force. It was the perfect cornerstone to harmonize the solitary yang of the Celestial Thunder and Scarlet Sun thunder-fire Dao Fruits.

"Xu Yunfan! You're using me as a sacrifice?!"

Wukong's molten golden pupils trembled violently. He instantly realized what Xu Yunfan intended to do. His stone body was hurtling forward under Xu Yunfan's tight control, but his soul was frantically struggling.

Wukong's furious roar exploded in the sea of consciousness.

"That Qilu is at the Golden Core realm. Its Dao Fruit is of the same origin and symbiotic with it. Sending me to seize the fruit is no different from sending me to my death!"

Xu Yunfan's cold response pierced through the obstruction of the Sea of Bitterness.

"You are a manifestation born of my Yunji Avatar. Your true spirit's origin is entirely tied to mine. If not now, when will you retreat?"

Wukong let out a desperate howl.

"I fought the Tong Xuan for you, and this is my reward?! You promised me freedom!"

"Enough noise," Xu Yunfan's spiritual will remained completely unmoved. "If you get the Dao Fruit, I will allow you to forge a new Dao body. If you fall, you will simply return to the Starry Banner. Your true spirit is on the banner; as long as it isn't destroyed, you can be reassembled in time."

The Qilu's blood-red eyes had already locked onto Wukong. The Dao Fruit was its伴生 (companion-born) object and the foundation for it to advance to the mid-stage of the Golden Core realm. How could it allow another to lay a hand on it?

"Ant! How dare you steal the Dao!"

The dragon's roar shattered the blood sea. The Qilu's claws, wreathed in purple-black Sea of Bitterness origin thunder, tore through the space around them like shattered glass.

Even more terrifying, the Dao Fruit's clear luster rippled in response. The supreme yin coldness froze the stellar power, and Wukong's speed suddenly dropped by a third. This fruit was born from the supreme yin origin of the Sea of Bitterness, naturally suppressing all external spiritual power.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's reckless, death-defying move, the White-Haired True Lord's face turned ashen with fury. He had laid out his plans for years, all to seize Xu Yunfan's Celestial Thunder Dao Fruit to extend his lifespan. If the Qilu devoured this body, which contained a part of Xu Yunfan, and used its companion Dao Fruit as a guide, it could very likely transform into a mid-stage Golden Core fierce spirit of the Sea of Bitterness.

Then all his plans would be ruined.

He truly couldn't understand why Xu Yunfan would do such a thing, only to benefit someone else. Was it that he would rather give it to this wicked dragon than to him?

"Not a chance!"

He shrieked and lunged out. From his sleeves, thousands of vengeful soul chains shot forth. The ends of the chains flickered with Samsara runes, and they arrived first, wrapping around Wukong's ankles, intending to pull him away from the dragon's claws.

The killing intent from the three parties instantly intertwined.

Xu Yunfan controlled Wukong to detonate his final trump card. The main stars of the Starry Banner exploded one after another, and all the remaining stellar power was poured into the stone body's right fist.

Leveraging the先天圣灵 (Primordial Saint Spirit) body, Xu Yunfan poured in a vast amount of spiritual power, causing a mighty torrent of power to appear and coalesce behind Wukong. The fist's edge bloomed with a molten golden light as it smashed fiercely toward the point of convergence between the chains and the dragon's claws.

"BOOM!!!"

A ten-thousand-foot wave of blood erupted from the Sea of Bitterness. The vengeful soul chains shattered inch by inch, and the scales on the Qilu's claws flew everywhere.

But the stellar power was finally exhausted, and the spiritual power for this punch was also depleted. Wukong's right arm, made of stone, exploded with a loud bang.

The White-Haired True Lord took advantage of the situation to close in, his枯掌 (withered palm) like a blade, stabbing straight for Wukong's chest, his expression ferocious.

"Your Dao Fruit is mine now!"

At the line between life and death, the right-headed Dharma form of Xu Yunfan's 'Lin' state was constantly deducing atop the Celestial Thunder Mountain. In the 'Lin' state, he decisively abandoned Wukong. His spiritual will connected to the core of the Starry Banner, using the strong control feature of the attribute panel to forcibly recall it.

"Xu Yunfan! You won't die a good dea—"

Wukong's curse was cut short as the White-Haired True Lord's palm-blade pierced his chest. Gray-white Samsara runes spread from the wound, instantly eroding the stone body's shell.

At the exact same moment, the Qilu's giant maw bit down, and the Sea of Bitterness origin thunder swallowed Wukong's remains.

"Pfft!"

The clone disintegrated, and a single true spirit fled into the Star Banner.

The White-Haired True Lord only crushed a sky-full of stone fragments. The Starry Banner, however, had transformed into a流光 (flowing light), tearing through the barrier of the Sea of Bitterness and vanishing without a trace.

"Yunji Avatar Technique?!"

The White-Haired True Lord stood frozen on the spot, his face turning from green to black.

"A fine Xu Yunfan! To have cultivated the 'Xuandu Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Yunji' to the point of blending the real with the fake!"

He had painstakingly set his trap, even baring his true form, only to hunt down a mere clone. Xu Yunfan's true body had remained holed up in the Celestial Thunder Mountain all along. Now that he had alerted the snake, it would be as difficult as reaching the heavens to plot against him again.

At this thought, the White-Haired True Lord felt an indescribable frustration well up in his chest; he wanted nothing more than to slaughter Xu Yunfan's entire family to vent his anger.

"ROAR!"

The Qilu, enraged, closed in, its blood-red eyes locking onto the only remaining intruder.

The White-Haired True Lord looked at the Dao Fruit on the dragon's head, his face twisting like a vengeful ghost. His lifespan was running out. If he couldn't get this fruit to harmonize yin and yang, he could only use his immortal nature to reincarnate.

But the cataclysmic killing tribulation Xu Yunfan had faced when he established his Dao was still fresh in his mind. The encirclement by the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the ambush by the Bodhisattva Pure Land, the internal strife within the Primordial Origin Sect... Would this world give a reincarnated True Lord another chance to ascend the Dao path?

"This fruit is my final gamble!" the White-Haired True Lord roared, his gray robe igniting with幽蓝 (icy blue) soul flames as he charged at the Qilu.

Above the Sea of Bitterness, the deafening roar of the death duel between the lone man and the dragon echoed, the surging blood waves like a prelude to the apocalypse.

The Starry Banner tore through the void and returned, its surface covered in cracks, and merged into Xu Yunfan's palm. He gazed toward the direction of the Sea of Bitterness, the light in his eyes gradually fading.

"Tong Xuan has fallen, the White-Haired True Lord has been exposed, the Qilu is gravely wounded... This trip was not a loss."

However, he couldn't help but sigh in his heart. This expedition had started poorly, costing him one clone right from the start.
