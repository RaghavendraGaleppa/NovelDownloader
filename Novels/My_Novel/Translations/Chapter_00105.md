Chapter 105: Return to the Manor, Han Ying Takes Command

After several days of seclusion, Li Xian was boiling a tiger bone and beast soup that evening. The soup was bubbling, having simmered long enough to extract the essence. Li Xian cracked two bird eggs into it, sprinkled in two handfuls of salt and a handful of scallions, and added some wild mountain vegetables.

The color, aroma, and taste were all excellent.

Just as he was marveling at his improved culinary skills and preparing to devour the meal, Fu Bo arrived.

"Master, I have brought your salary," Fu Bo said respectfully.

"Huh?" Li Xian was taken aback. "My salary? How did you get it? Come to think of it, I haven't collected my pay for months."

Fu Bo explained the reason.

It turned out that Black River Village belonged to the Madam's tenant farmers. Every year after winter, the village chief had to report the village's situation to the manor—whether there were births or deaths. They and their descendants were destined to be the Madam's tenants forever. When Fu Bo went to the manor, Uncle Xiang, the accountant, asked him to bring Li Xian's salary back so he wouldn't have to make a separate trip.

"Master, it's incredibly chaotic out there right now," Fu Bo said. "You should see the manor's guards; they're running around in a panic."

Fu Bo handed over the money bag. Li Xian checked the contents; it was indeed his salary for the past few months.

"I heard," Fu Bo continued, his eyes gleaming with gossip, "that the captain of the manor's guards has changed. That's a rare occurrence. Many of the guards are talking about it."

"Oh? Changed?" Li Xian's heart skipped a beat. "Is the captain no longer surnamed Pang?"

"No longer. Now he's surnamed Hua," Fu Bo said. "That man is truly arrogant, nothing like your affable nature, Master. We were almost kicked out the moment we entered the manor. But then again, how could there be another person like you in this world? In my opinion, if you were the captain, that would be perfect."

Li Xian frowned slightly. "Do you know why? Did Captain Pang get a promotion or something?"

"Not sure," Fu Bo recalled. "It seems... he was injured and can't get out of bed, so he handed the duties over to Captain Hua."

"The injury must be severe," Li Xian mused.

Unfortunately, it was too far away, so he couldn't see Pang Long.

Li Xian recalled Huan Hanying's eyes; this man was definitely not broad-minded, yet Pang Long had been completely unguarded against him.

"I have to be wary of Huan Hanying. He is narrow-minded but very ambitious. I have a feeling he has coveted the captain's position for a long time. Captain Pang has treated me well. I need to remind him about this," Li Xian thought.

He put away the money and decided to return to the manor the next day.

He finished the tiger soup. The taste was excellent; the wild mountain vegetables neutralized the gamey flavor of the tiger meat. The handful of salt brought out the freshness of the meat, and the flowing bone marrow added a rich flavor. If he had added some sweet fruit, the taste would have been even more complex.

The next day, before dawn, Li Xian set off. He moved with light steps and fast legs. With a full-force leap, he covered several yards in a single bound.

His speed was astonishing.

Before the hour of Chen (7-9 a.m.), he had already returned to the manor.

He went straight to Pang Long's residence and found that Pang Long was indeed seriously injured. His face was pale, and he was lying on the bed, his breath weak.

"Captain Pang," Li Xian called out.

"Cough, cough," Pang Long woke up, his eyes unfocused. It took a long while for his vision to clear and recognize Li Xian.

"Li... Li Xian... how... how did you come?"

His voice was weak as he propped himself up with his right hand.

"I heard you were seriously injured, so I came back to see you," Li Xian said as he infused his Qi into Pang Long's body. "Captain Pang, how did this happen? Your injuries are severe."

His liver and spleen were damaged, and the bones in his right leg were fractured inch by inch. With such injuries, without a supreme treasure to heal him, he would never fully recover. A lifelong disability was almost certain. Furthermore, his left wrist had been sliced off by a blade. The lingering sword intent in the wound had prevented it from healing. If Pang Long hadn't known how to staunch the blood and close his pores, he would have bled to death long ago.

"It's a long story. I won't get into it," Pang Long said, shaking his head weakly. "It's very thoughtful of you to come specifically to see me."

Li Xian frowned. "You're so badly injured and can't move properly. Why isn't anyone here to take care of you?"

Pang Long was stunned. After a moment, he said, "Everyone has their own duties. With my injuries, rest is all I need." His expression couldn't hide his loneliness.

In reality, he knew that all the guards at the manor were trying to curry favor with Huan Hanying. A sick dragon is no match for a young eagle. When the Madam learned of the situation, she merely said, "I know. Go rest," and never asked about it again.

"Captain Pang, I have to go back to my post, so I can't stay long. This trip was, first, to check on your injuries, and second..." Li Xian said solemnly, "Forgive me for being suspicious, but you must be careful of Huan Hanying."

"Han Ying joined the manor at the same age as you," Pang Long said, shaking his head. "We are all loyal to the Madam. As long as we are loyal to her, there's no need to think too much into it."

"Perhaps," Li Xian shrugged and dropped the subject.

After a few more words, Li Xian took his leave.

Walking through the manor, Li Xian suddenly felt a sense of melancholy. Although he was a guard, he wasn't familiar with the manor. Some of the wild forests and wastelands he had never even set foot in.

As he walked along the road, he passed the guards' courtyard. Just then, the sound of footsteps approached. A group of guards had just finished their morning training and were returning to the courtyard to practice their martial arts.

"Have you heard? Later, Master Hua is going to discuss something with us."

"Hey, still calling him 'Master'? He's Captain Hua now. Don't make a mistake. If you make him unhappy, we'll all be in trouble."

"Captain Hua is the new broom sweeping clean. Sigh, I think he's a man of great talent. Being an A-rank guard isn't his limit."

"Captain Pang has stepped down to make way for a worthy successor. I heard his injuries this time are really serious. I wonder if he can recover."

"Who cares? If he recovers, we'll just treat him like a master again."

The crowd rushed inside.

Li Xian had no interest and turned to leave. He ran into Huan Hanying head-on. He had shed his guard uniform and was wearing the captain's attire. He looked young and handsome, quite impressive.

"Li Xian?" Huan Hanying was surprised, then smiled. "Good, since you're here, you can listen too. This concerns you as well."

He walked directly to the front of the crowd and said, "Everyone, I, Huan Hanying, have been promoted to acting captain. Before Captain Pang recovers, all matters regarding the guards are at my discretion."

"I have improved upon the previous captain's rules and established new regulations. I am here to inform you all."

"Patrol duties remain the same as before. The main change is the guard ranks. After much consideration, I have decided to implement a major reform."

Huan Hanying spoke eloquently. "You have all served the Madam loyally for ten or twenty years. The original ranking system was unfair. It gave schemers a chance to take shortcuts and chilled the hearts of those who坚守ed their duties for ten or twenty years without a promotion."

"Therefore, today I am changing the 'A, B, C, D' ranks to 'First, Second, Third, and Fourth' ranks. I am also improving the promotion requirements."

"First, a Fourth-rank guard must have been at the manor for at least two years before they can attempt a promotion..."

By this point, his true intentions were revealed.

After explaining the new rules, Huan Hanying glanced at Li Xian, secretly pleased with himself. With this move, he could downgrade Li Xian's "B-rank" to "Fourth-rank." The clever part was that most guards could retain their original treatment.

The captain's position held immense authority. Aside from the Madam's direct orders, the captain had the final say on guard promotions, patrols, and training.

Huan Hanying had just become captain and hadn't fully settled in yet. He might not have the power to make sweeping reforms, but he was more than happy to flaunt his power and intimidate his subordinates.

"How utterly boring," Li Xian turned to leave.

"If anyone has any objections, you may voice them. You can propose a better plan. Of course... since we are all martial artists, we can also settle it with a martial arts contest to see whose view is correct," Huan Hanying said, feeling smug. As the captain, he controlled the life and death of the guards. Even if he said this, no one would dare to refute him. It also showed his "generosity."

Li Xian paused, then suddenly laughed. "Captain Huan, what did you just say?"

"Huh?" Huan Hanying also smiled. "Hahaha. Since you didn't hear clearly, I'll explain it to you personally. Li Xian, you are young and already a B-rank. That's quite an achievement."

"With the new rules, you've fallen back to Fourth-rank. The drop is a bit steep. As your captain, I can understand that."

"But, as the saying goes, true gold is not afraid of fire. As long as you have real skill, after the two-year period is up, you can be promoted again."

"We all serve the Madam. Who doesn't have to endure two or three years before they can rise to prominence?"

"It's a good thing for a young man to be tempered more."

As soon as he said this, the others all voiced their agreement.

Ever since Li Xian joined the manor, his performance had been dazzling, and he had stolen the spotlight. He had achieved fame and fortune in less than half a year. The goal others struggled for their entire lives was easily taken by him. The resentment was understandable.

Ignoring the others' opinions, Li Xian smiled. "Captain Huan, since true gold is not afraid of fire, how about I test you?"

"What do you mean?" Huan Hanying said angrily. "You want to fight me?"

"Are you objecting to the new rules, so you're challenging me to a duel?"

Li Xian nodded. "You could say that."

"Such audacity!" Huan Hanying cursed inwardly. He clenched his fists and narrowed his eyes, scanning the crowd. He had already made his declaration; he couldn't go back on it.

He immediately thought: "I was just looking for someone to make an example of. You're walking right into it. Let me show you how I earned this captain's position!"

He said, "Alright, I said earlier that those with objections can settle it with their fists. But once you step onto the stage, fists and feet have no eyes. You must consider this carefully!"

Seeing that a fight was about to break out, the crowd was excited. They looked back and forth between Huan Hanying and Li Xian, whispering among themselves.

"Li Xian is too young; he can't hold his temper."

"Without Pang Long to back him up, he's at most a C-rank. How dare he challenge Captain Huan? He's truly arrogant."

"Sigh, Li Xian does have some real skill. He could have easily held onto his B-rank. But if he fights Captain Huan, he probably won't be a match."

"Everyone has seen Captain Huan's Fire Eagle Claw. Its power is formidable. Li Xian has the Azure Silk Palm, but... it seems he only just mastered it not long ago."

"That's not all. Captain Huan has already achieved a full Qi cycle. The difference in their internal Qi is like heaven and earth."

Huan Hanying puffed out his chest and leaped onto the stage. Hearing the crowd's discussion, he felt very confident.

"A man's word is his bond. I won't go back on my word, and I hope you won't either. Get on the stage and fight me now!" he roared, his voice like thunder, afraid that Li Xian might back out at the last moment.

Li Xian said, "A man's word is his bond indeed."

With that, he also walked onto the stage. He didn't care about the guard rank. With his strength, he feared no empty title. However, Huan Hanying was deliberately making things difficult, waving the captain's banner and wearing an arrogant expression that was disgusting to look at.

"Fourth-rank Guard Li Xian, please instruct me, Captain Huan."
