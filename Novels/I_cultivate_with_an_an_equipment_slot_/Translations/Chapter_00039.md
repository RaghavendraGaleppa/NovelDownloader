# Chapter 39: Becoming a Golden Core Disciple  

"May I ask what you mean by that?" Zhang Yan felt slightly troubled upon hearing Mu Sen's words.  

"In the Tianmu Mountain Range, our Qingheng Sect reigns supreme. While holding back the demon beasts, we continuously extract all available resources to sustain our cultivators.  

"However, resources are finite, while the number of cultivators keeps increasing. The supply is severely insufficient, and if this continues, major problems will inevitably arise."  

"So, Senior Brother means... the sect plans to expand its territory?" Zhang Yan instinctively guessed.  

"Exactly—expansion." Mu Sen nodded approvingly at Zhang Yan's quick deduction.  

"If there are too many cultivators and not enough resources, we must expand by conquering the Tianmu Mountain Range. Though many may perish in the process, the sect’s domain will grow, uncovering more spiritual lands and ley lines. Those who survive will reap tremendous benefits."  

"Once the expansion begins, nearly everyone will be mobilized for battle. It’s extremely dangerous, so you must prepare yourself."  

Mu Sen paused briefly before continuing, "Of course, don’t be too nervous. Who knows? You might become a True Disciple before the expansion begins. Then you wouldn’t have to participate—hahaha!"  

He laughed heartily at his own words.  

True Disciples of the Qingheng Sect were all potential Golden Core cultivators.  

Take Mu Sen, for example—though highly talented, he was only an Inner Sect disciple, not a True Disciple. Now, facing a cultivation bottleneck, he was about to be assigned as a sect steward.  

Becoming a True Disciple was incredibly difficult.  

But once achieved, their status would soar, ranking only below the sect master and Golden Core elders.  

"True Disciple... That’s too difficult. I don’t think I’m ready yet." Zhang Yan chuckled in response.  

But inwardly, he had already made up his mind.  

Though his aptitude might be lacking, he made up for it with sheer effort!  

With continuous hard work—and a little help from his Equipment Panel—he was confident he could soon stand out among his peers.  

As for leaving the sect? That thought never crossed his mind.  

Having just received the sect’s generosity, fleeing due to the dangers of expansion was not his way—nor did it align with his Dao.  

---  

Lost in thought, Zhang Yan barely noticed as Mu Sen brought him back to the Qingheng Sect.  

"By the way, Junior Brother, how is your Wood Elemental Technique coming along?" Mu Sen asked as they parted ways.  

"Almost there. I’ll come find you once I achieve mastery," Zhang Yan replied.  

"Good. I’ll be waiting." Mu Sen smiled, visibly pleased.  

---  

After bidding farewell to Mu Sen, Zhang Yan summoned his Golden Bamboo Sword and returned to the valley he managed.  

During his absence, another batch of spirit rice had been harvested and sold by the local farmers.  

After deducting wages, land rent, and miscellaneous expenses, his profits were meager.  

Settling accounts with the farmers, Zhang Yan resumed tending the fields himself.  

Holding the spirit hoe under the sun, he felt his mind relax.  

"Truly, farming is the most peaceful life. Fighting and killing—that’s not for me!" he mused.  

But he knew better.  

Choosing the path of cultivation meant inevitable conflicts. Even if he harbored no ill intent, he needed the strength to defend himself when danger arose.  

Farming brought him joy, but as his cultivation grew, 200 acres of spirit fields no longer sufficed.  

Now, he used the Golden Bamboo Sword’s blade aura to plow the land—far more efficient than conventional methods.  

If only he had learned earth-attribute spells, the work would be even easier.  

"Next, I’ll rent 500 acres," Zhang Yan decided silently.  

Glancing at the sun, he set aside thoughts of expansion.  

It was time to meet Mu Sen and reveal his progress.  

Mounting the Golden Bamboo Sword, he leisurely flew from the outer sect to the inner sect, heading straight for Wood Spirit Peak.  

As he approached, he sent a jade talisman message to Mu Sen.  

Before long, a streak of light shot toward him from the peak.  

Judging by the speed, it could only be Mu Sen.  

"Junior Brother Zhang, have you mastered the Wood Elemental Technique?"  

"Indeed, I have."  

Zhang Yan extended his hand, revealing an emerald-green glow.  

"You—"  

"You—" Mu Sen’s eyes widened in disbelief.  

"You’re nearing perfection?"  

"Perfection may take a bit longer," Zhang Yan admitted sheepishly. "I originally planned to wait until then, but I realized it might exceed our agreed timeframe."  

"You—"  

"You—"  

Mu Sen took a deep breath, momentarily speechless.  

---  

After a long pause, he finally spoke.  

"Come with me. We’re going to see my master."  

Without delay, he led Zhang Yan to a cave abode on Wood Spirit Peak.  

Though unremarkable from the outside, the interior stunned Zhang Yan.  

Rich spiritual energy filled the space, with puppet servants attending to tasks and spirit plants and beasts thriving within.  

It was like a paradise.  

Mu Sen, familiar with the surroundings, guided him straight to a grand hall.  

"Disciple Mu Sen pays respects to Master!"  

Before the hall, he announced himself.  

"Enter."  

A dignified woman’s voice responded.  

Inside, a middle-aged Daoist sat on a meditation cushion, observing them.  

"Master, this is Junior Brother Zhang, whom I mentioned before."  

Mu Sen bowed respectfully.  

"Have you mastered the Wood Elemental Technique?" The Daoist ignored Mu Sen, focusing solely on Zhang Yan.  

"Yes, Senior. I have."  

Zhang Yan demonstrated the technique again.  

The Daoist’s eyes narrowed slightly in surprise.  

"Your Uncle Wei recently acquired some fine tea. Go fetch some for me."  

She glanced at Mu Sen, who immediately understood the dismissal.  

"Yes, Master."  

Before leaving, Mu Sen gave Zhang Yan an encouraging look.  

Once alone with Zhang Yan, the Daoist’s expression turned stern.  

"You’re quite bold, daring to deceive me with tricks!"  

Her voice struck Zhang Yan like a thunderclap, jolting his spirit!
