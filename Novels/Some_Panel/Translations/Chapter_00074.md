# Chapter 73: Dao Sect, I'm Here!

Standing in the air, Yang Ji felt a certain summons from the golden tadpole runes hidden beneath his skin, guiding him. This sensation had been present for over three years. Yang Ji knew it was the Legacy Meditation Mat left by Senior Fu Dongliu. However, he had already obtained the legacy, and he had been focused on honing his combat skills with the Nascent Soul True Monarchs within his sect, so he hadn't paid it any mind. Now that his Sword Domain was complete, he found himself free, and a touch of curiosity arose within him. He wondered what kind of people would come for the legacy.

A strange smile appeared on Yang Ji's face. He informed his master and then flew towards the Demonic Scent Sea Region. His sword wings vibrated at extreme speed; as a Golden Core peak cultivator, he could easily activate them. The pair of sword wings shimmered brightly, propelling him through clouds and tearing through the sky, allowing him to reach the Demonic Scent Sea Region in three days.

Yang Ji first went to Wangmo Island, and upon discovering that the spiritual light from the underwater waterfall had not yet risen, he proceeded to Black Wind Island. There, he exchanged some high-grade demon-companion herbs and demonic cores with Mang Biao. After so many years of cultivation, he had very few Nine Revolutions Golden Cores left on him, so finding these herbs and cores would serve as a contingency. If he were to go to the Dao Sect and find himself without pills, these could supplement his needs, preventing him from being caught unprepared or living frugally. Over the next few days, Yang Ji simultaneously observed the situation on Wangmo Island and, in exchange, refined Demonic Essence Pills for Mang Biao.

It was on the fifth day when he returned to Wangmo Island that he saw, from afar, spiritual light soaring into the sky, identical to the spiritual light that had erupted from the underwater waterfall previously. This time, however, it wasn't just the underwater waterfall; an area spanning dozens of miles around was shimmering with spiritual light. During this process, the spiritual light attracted a large number of cultivators who came to watch. With cultivators spread across dozens of miles of airspace, Yang Ji couldn't distinguish who the inheritors were. However, he was certain that all the inheritors should have arrived; after all, the Legacy Meditation Mat had sent out a signal three years ago, and given such an opportunity, there was no reason for them not to come, and they had ample time to arrive.

This spiritual light was different from the one at the underwater waterfall. The previous time, it was an earthquake that broke a spatial restriction, causing spiritual light to dissipate. This time, the spiritual light actively shot into the sky, forming a massive spiritual vortex in mid-air. The spiritual light flowed, and the spiritual vortex gradually stabilized and took shape. Seeing this, some experienced cultivators immediately recognized it as a teleportation channel and excitedly rushed into it. Witnessing someone bravely leading the way, a few bolder cultivators quickly followed suit. For a moment, streams of light converged into the spiritual vortex, creating a truly spectacular Xianxia scene.

At this moment, on the periphery, only some cautious cultivators hesitated, observing from a distance. Yang Ji glanced at them, then smiled and flew into the spiritual vortex himself.

He reappeared directly inside the stone array. The stone array had now transformed into a reception array. The arriving crowd crossed a stone bridge and reached the end of the underground world. For a moment, many cultivators were surprised: how did the spiritual vortex lead to an underground world? They knew that a hundred years ago, they had come here through the underwater waterfall. Upon seeing this, some became excited, exclaiming that there truly was a profound mystery here. With the spiritual light automatically forming a spiritual vortex to guide them, the cave mansion must have opened.

Indeed, as the crowd excitedly whispered, the Concealment Restriction disappeared, revealing a stretch of ancient, simple houses behind it. Witnessing this scene, everyone's breathing quickened, their auras surged, and they moved like the wind, rushing towards the houses. However, with a hum, a translucent qi wall appeared, blocking their path. More precisely, it was a Spatial Teleportation Restriction. As everyone looked on in surprise, text began to appear on the Spatial Teleportation Restriction: "Teleportation Condition: Fated individuals who have cultivated the first volume of the Humanoid Weapon to perfection may enter the legacy ground to contend for the legacy."

"This truly is a legacy left by a master; I knew this spiritual light was not simple, but what is this 'Humanoid Weapon'?" Seeing this, the crowd was both surprised and puzzled. Some cultivators' eyes flickered, and they immediately made their moves, attempting to break through the Spatial Teleportation Restriction. However, all their attacks, upon contacting the restriction, sank as if into a swamp, being absorbed. Throughout the process, the spatial restriction merely rippled symbolically, like a gentle breeze across water, unable to stir up any real waves.

"This... it seems the spatial restriction cannot be destroyed. Presumably, only the inheritors chosen by that senior can enter. We have no chance." A Golden Core True Person, seeing the futile attacks of the crowd, shook his head repeatedly in disappointment. At the same time, he couldn't help but search among the crowd, trying to see where the inheritors were.

It was then that seven people stepped forward, faces smiling. Among these seven were an old man with white hair, a beautiful immortal maiden, a young woman in practical attire, a cold-faced young man, and a dignified and domineering middle-aged man. A golden light flashed on these seven people, and they reached out, pressing their hands onto the Spatial Teleportation Restriction. A suction force was generated, pulling half of their bodies inside.

At that very moment, the Nascent Soul True Monarch of the Huang Family from the Thousand Islands Sea Region suddenly made a move, abruptly reaching out and placing a hand on a young man's shoulder. Seeing his action, the Nascent Soul True Monarchs of the three major sects followed suit, placing their hands on the shoulders of the inheritors, hoping to ride their momentum into the legacy ground. But they were disappointed.

Hum! The Spatial Teleportation Restriction produced a powerful tremor, bouncing them all back. This was because they did not possess the unique golden runes characteristic of the Humanoid Weapon and were thus repelled. For a moment, they staggered backward, their expressions turning grim.

Inside, the seven inheritors who had entered exchanged glances, and the atmosphere immediately turned peculiar. The next instant, they all transformed into streams of light, flying at extreme speed towards the legacy ground. But soon, they emerged again, frowning. Subsequently, they appeared in and out of various houses, their faces growing darker, and the atmosphere increasingly strange. Yang Ji, observing this from outside, couldn't help but secretly smile.

The seven arriving individuals were quite formidable; the lowest among them were at Golden Core peak. The white-haired old man among them was an expert at Nascent Soul Second Stage, having already overcome the fire tribulation and being only a step away from Nascent Soul Third Stage, achieving a Pure Yang Soul. He, who had originally been confident of success, was now frowning deeply, utterly frustrated. He eyed the other six with ill intent; if they hadn't entered the legacy ground together, he would have suspected one of them had secretly taken the legacy cultivation method.

Yang Ji looked at the old man. If he were to truly compete with them inside, he might not necessarily be able to defeat him. The aura exuded by this old man was far more powerful than that of the Sinister True Monarch and his like; they were not on the same level at all. Additionally, the middle-aged man with a dignified demeanor was also a Nascent Soul True Monarch. He exuded an awe-inspiring presence, clearly a figure of real power in some major force. Although he was only at Nascent Soul First Stage, his aura was equally strong, not someone to be trifled with. The other five also looked profound and composed, clearly fearless. At a glance, they seemed to be characters with considerable backing, each appearing extraordinary.

What surprised Yang Ji the most was that the youngest of them, the young woman in practical attire, was actually a Spirit Physique. Although she concealed it very well, not revealing a trace of spiritual charm, Yang Ji still saw through her essence at a glance. Needless to say, with such talent, she must be a Heavenly Prodigy from a major force in the Boundless Sea. These seven people all looked unfamiliar, suggesting they were cultivators from outside the Thousand Islands Sea Region. They had come with grand ambitions, but could only return defeated. At this moment, standing in front of the houses, they appeared utterly dejected. The legacy? Where did it go? They didn't know that the person who had obtained the legacy had already left the underground world with a smile.

Watching the other inheritors stumble, Yang Ji's mood brightened considerably. Fortunately, he had taken the cultivation method beforehand, otherwise, he would have been embroiled in a fight today.

After emerging from the underground world, Yang Ji flew straight towards the sect. He had nothing left to prepare. The magical artifacts and spiritual tools he had obtained from Senior Fu Dongliu were useless to him and had long been handed over to the sect. The pill formulas had also been improved and perfected, compiled into a pill classic, and given to the sect. All his cultivation arts, except for the Humanoid Weapon, had reached perfection, and his strength could hardly make any further leaps. Continuing reclusive cultivation now would be meaningless, merely wasting his limited lifespan. At this moment, only by going to the Dao Sect could his strength advance further.

In the Conference Hall, White-Browed Supreme and all the Nascent Soul True Monarchs of the sect were present. Everyone looked at Yang Ji, their faces showing smiles of relief and anticipation.

"Xiao Ji, this storage ring contains ten million spirit stones. When you go to the Dao Sect, spend what you need, make connections as necessary, don't be too frugal. Although our Canglan Sect is a small sect, we must not lose face when you go to the Dao Sect." White-Browed Supreme smiled gently, flicked his finger, and sent a ring towards Yang Ji.

"Thank you, Supreme!" Yang Ji hesitated for a moment, then nodded and accepted it. He had never been to the Dao Sect, and the situation there was unclear; having some spirit stones on him would allow him to act with more confidence.

"Xiao Ji, this is the Dao Sect Token. With this token, you can enter the Dao Sect," White-Browed Supreme gently tossed it, and a token landed in Yang Ji's hand. The token was only palm-sized, ancient and mystical in design, covered with strange patterns that intertwined to form two characters—Wuji (Boundless).

"This is the token of the Boundless Dao Sect!" White-Browed Supreme slowly stated, "The Boundless Dao Sect is incredibly powerful. Not only our Thousand Islands Sea Region, but even the entire Boundless Sea is within the Boundless Dao Sect's sphere of influence." He continued, "This is just the tip of the iceberg of the Boundless Dao Sect's power; its strength is unimaginable. Xiao Ji, if you can establish a firm foothold in the Dao Sect, you will truly have one foot on the immortal path."

"Supreme, I will definitely strive to remain in the Dao Sect," Yang Ji nodded.

"Your strength is evident to all of us. As long as your luck isn't too bad and you don't encounter a hell-level assessment, your chances of remaining in the Dao Sect will be as high as eighty percent. If you become a true disciple of the Dao Sect, our Canglan Sect will also benefit," White-Browed Supreme stroked his beard and chuckled.

"That's right, Junior Nephew. In the thousands of years of our Canglan Sect's history, only you and Changxiao have shown such outstanding comprehension. If you two can forever remain in the Dao Sect, then our Canglan Sect will truly stand firm in this Thousand Islands Sea Region," Qinghe True Monarch smiled.

"Please rest assured, Supreme. Please rest assured, Senior Uncles. I will give my all and not let down the sect's expectations," Yang Ji said solemnly.

"Xiao Ji, if that is the case, then let us depart. The sun is just rising now; it is a good time, symbolizing that your journey to the Dao Sect will be like the rising sun, shining brightly in the sky, as you soar to great heights," White-Browed Supreme smiled, then leaped forward, grabbed Yang Ji, and flew out of the main hall. His master, Jian Yuanzi, accompanied them.

"Xiao Ji, we are heading to Immortal Pass Island. On that island, there is the only teleportation array in our Thousand Islands Sea Region that leads to the Cultivation Continent. Teleportation takes three days; if we were to travel by ship, it would take decades to reach the Cultivation Continent," White-Browed Supreme explained.

"The Boundless Dao Sect recruits disciples once every ten years. Calculating the time, it will be time for the Dao Sect to accept new disciples in a few days. We will arrive just in time," Jian Yuanzi chuckled.

"Xiao Ji, below is Immortal Pass Island," White-Browed Supreme's speed was incredibly fast, and they soon reached their destination. He pointed downwards. Following White-Browed Supreme's gaze, Yang Ji saw a small island. In the middle of the island was a flat area with several halls. A considerable crowd was bustling on the square. As the three of them landed, Yang Ji quickly scanned the area before White-Browed Supreme led him into the Teleportation Hall.

Upon entering, Yang Ji saw a "familiar face"—the young woman in practical attire, looking unusually capable, was also here. As if sensing Yang Ji's gaze, she also cast a scrutinizing look, then, with apparent disinterest, shifted her eyes away and began to toy with a small dagger in her hand. Yang Ji glanced at her, then withdrew his gaze as well.

Everyone waited for three full days before the teleportation array in the hall finally lit up again. "Come on, come on, those who are teleporting next, get ready!" The person in charge of teleportation in the hall immediately shouted.

"Xiao Ji, your journey to the Dao Sect might not be as harmonious as it is within the sect. That place is full of opportunities, but also full of competition. If the path ahead needs to be cleared with your sword, then clear it with your sword, even if it's stained with blood!" Jian Yuanzi patted Yang Ji's shoulder, speaking profoundly.

"Master, I understand!" Sword intent flowed in Yang Ji's eyes, and that unparalleled sword light responded to Jian Yuanzi's words.

"Xiao Ji, you must be cautious and careful in everything," White-Browed Supreme said gently.

Yang Ji nodded in understanding: "Supreme, Master, this disciple is leaving." He bowed respectfully, then turned and stepped into the teleportation array.

The young woman inside the teleportation array watched this scene playfully, a sneer on her lips. Above her head, information appeared: [Another pampered sect 'darling.' Is he going to the Dao Sect? His sect elders even escorted him to the teleportation array, afraid he might trip and fall outside? I bet he won't even make it past the first assessment.]

Yang Ji's expression involuntarily froze as he glimpsed the information displayed above the young woman's head. He immediately felt a surge of indignation. Calling him pampered was one thing, but saying he wouldn't survive the first assessment was going a bit too far. As he mused to himself, the teleportation array burst with spiritual light, and everyone instantly vanished.

After three days of teleportation, everyone had arrived on the Cultivation Continent. However, this was not yet the Boundless Dao Sect; it was merely a city bordering the Boundless Sea. Immediately after, Yang Ji and the young woman teleported again. This time, their destination would be the Boundless Dao Sect. After two days, they finally arrived.

Upon teleporting out, Yang Ji stood within the teleportation hall and immediately felt an extremely concentrated spiritual qi. He looked around and couldn't help but murmur, "Is this the Boundless Dao Sect?"

"Not yet. This is just the reception hall. The Boundless Dao Sect is still further ahead!" Having endured so many days of teleportation together, the young woman glanced at him and, uncharacteristically, struck up a conversation.

Yang Ji nodded and followed the young woman's footsteps. When he emerged, he found an area constructed with many teleportation halls, and many young men and women were also emerging from other such halls. It was then that a majestic man in a purple robe flew over, hovering in the air, and commanded, "Follow me!" Everyone immediately followed the man, flying forward. Yang Ji glanced at him and joined the group.

As they flew, the spiritual qi ahead grew increasingly dense. Gazing at the boundless cloud qi, like an abyss or a sea, Yang Ji's heart also broadened. Below, endless magnificent, towering peaks slowly began to come into view. Yang Ji knew he was getting closer to the Dao Sect. A faint warmth flowed through his blood, and a voice he couldn't suppress resonated within him.

"Boundless Dao Sect, I'm here!"
