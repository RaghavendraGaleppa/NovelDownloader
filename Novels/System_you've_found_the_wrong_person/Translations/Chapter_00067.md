# Chapter 67: No Chance to Overturn the Heavens  

At the center of the island in the lake stood a vast square.  

Dominating the square was an enormous beast, towering nearly a hundred feet tall. Its entire body was cast from metal, reflecting the sunlight with a chilling gleam.  

Dou Changsheng stared intently at the beast. It roared toward the sky, a single horn protruding from its head, its fangs sharp and menacing. The lifelike ferocity of its expression made it seem almost alive.  

Given Gongshu Duwang's mastery of mechanical arts, this was no mere ornament—it was undoubtedly a functional war machine.  

This matched the concept of the "Colossal Divine Soldier."  

Gongshu Duwang, dressed in coarse linen like a humble farmer, approached Dou Changsheng with a smile. "It resembles a Colossal Divine Soldier, doesn't it?"  

"This is also part of the Colossal Divine Soldier."  

"The Colossal Divine Soldier represents multiplicity, vastness, and power."  

"It isn't limited to a single form."  

"This is the mechanical beast, the One-Horned Savage Tiger. Originally, it was meant to be the Divine Beast White Tiger."  

"But constrained by the limitations of mechanical arts and resources, I alone couldn't complete such a grand masterpiece."  

"That's why the conflict between the Gongshu and Mo families is entirely unnecessary."  

"Our endless strife has claimed the lives of countless geniuses. Had they lived, they could have contributed greatly to the advancement of mechanical arts and aided me in forging the Divine Beast White Tiger."  

"Centuries of hatred cannot be resolved in mere words. To demonstrate my sincerity, I am willing to gift the blueprints of the Colossal Divine Soldier to the Mo family."  

"I invite the Mo family's leader to join me in crafting a mechanical Divine Beast White Tiger for Liang."  

"Why must we always be inferior to the ancients? If our predecessors could create miracles like the Colossal Divine Soldier, then so can we."  

"I seek to elevate mechanical arts to new heights."  

"By uniting the talents of the world and generations of brilliance, we will create our own miracles."  

"You are a prodigy, young man. At just eighteen, you've already earned a place on the Human Ranking. Few can match your talent."  

"With your intelligence, you are perfectly suited to inherit my mechanical arts."  

"Once the current conflicts are resolved, I will personally teach you the intricacies of mechanical arts."  

"If you're interested, you may experiment on your own. Should you wish to delve deeper, you may seek me out at any time. I will hold nothing back—I fear not those who learn, but those who do not understand."  

"As long as mechanical arts endure, the legacy of Gongshu will never fade."  

With a smile, Gongshu Duwang departed, leaving Dou Changsheng in a daze.  

When he had arrived on the island, he had expected intrigue, even bloodshed. Yet reality had defied his expectations.  

Gongshu Duwang possessed a magnanimity that, if matched by his actions, would undoubtedly establish him as a founding master of mechanical arts.  

He was not merely a contender for the title of King of Liang—he was a sage among the Hundred Schools of Thought, a saint of mechanical arts.  

The title of King of Liang was far too small for him.  

This man sought to become a sage.  

Dou Changsheng had encountered many on the Earth Ranking, yet none had possessed such presence.  

Gongshu Duwang was no mere idealist—he knew how to win hearts. First, he would consolidate the forces of Liang, then ally with the Mo family.  

Dou Changsheng chuckled wryly to himself.  

Of course.  

None of the masters of the Hundred Schools were simple figures.  

Each was a titan who shook the world. Their might may not have been unrivaled, but their knowledge was their true treasure. Even in death, their influence would persist through those who studied their teachings.  

Their legacies would endure for centuries, becoming woven into the fabric of culture.  

Some sought fleeting pleasures in life, while others sought immortal fame.  

Jin Wuming spoke gravely, "There are no truly selfless men in this world."  

"That old man seeks posthumous glory."  

"He seeks sainthood."  

"Those who chase fame are greedier than those who lust for wealth or power."  

"This won't be an easy hurdle."  

"The imperial court won't permit Liang to stir unrest, and the rise of mechanical arts won't sit well with the other schools."  

"The world is vast, yet no land is without an owner."  

"After the Legalists entered Qin, Li Yan faced countless assassination attempts. The most dangerous left him with a sword wound to the chest, teetering on the brink of death. At its darkest hour, even the Qin Emperor was replaced—three generations of steadfast rulers persevered, pushing through reforms until Qin's armies marched west, unstoppable, heralding Qin's golden age."  

"Mechanical arts may not rival the dominant Legalist school, but the struggle will be no less fierce."  

"All this talk of selflessness and openness is just a ploy to spread his teachings and win hearts."  

"If the Wang family of Xiangzhou learns mechanical arts, will they stand idly by as others slander it?"  

"Of course not. They'll defend it. With the Nine Heavens Cloud Crane renowned across nations, his endorsement alone could avert countless troubles."  

Dou Changsheng watched Jin Wuming's tirade with amusement. The man's nerves were frayed, seeing conspiracies everywhere. Shaking his head, Dou Changsheng didn't bother arguing.  

With the immediate danger gone, it was time to reap benefits. Dou Changsheng, ever the pragmatist, gestured for Jin Wuming to leave. When the latter only looked puzzled, Dou Changsheng clarified:  

"We belong to opposing factions—righteous and demonic."  

"We're not acquainted."  

"If we meet again, I will vanquish evil without hesitation."  

With no crisis at hand, why would he associate with a demonic cultivator?  

It would tarnish his reputation.  

Dou Changsheng strode away, well aware that a good name was hard-earned and easily lost. He knew where to draw the line.  

Jin Wuming took a deep breath, trying to suppress his anger—and failed.  

His entire body trembled with rage.  

Back in the Nine-Curve Formation, when direction was impossible to discern, Dou Changsheng hadn't cared that he was a demonic cultivator. He'd been all too eager to stick close. Now, suddenly, his reputation was a problem?  

The sheer audacity of this opportunist!  

His gaze shifted to the young woman from the Sun family, who was now chatting amiably with Dou Changsheng.  

Fury and frustration boiled within him.  

Then, his eyes sharpened.  

A figure clad in green robes, slender with graying temples, strode forward, a nine-tiered exquisite pagoda resting in his palm.  

Trouble had arrived.  

Jin Wuming's spirits lifted as he recognized the newcomer—Liu Baiyu, the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King, a powerful figure from the Northern Jin royal family.  

Ranked fourteenth on the Earth Ranking.  

He wasn't alone. Behind him walked a tall, lean man in white, a beast-patterned bronze sword strapped to his back—Lin Sanxing, the Skyward Sword, a commander of the Golden Feather Guard.  

Ranked thirty-seventh in the previous generation's Earth Ranking.  

And ranked thirty-third in the current generation—One-Eyed Divine Lord, Zhao Wudao.  

The appearance of these three drew countless gazes.  

Liu Baiyu stopped before the One-Horned Savage Tiger and spoke calmly, "The King of Yan is currently on a diplomatic tour, meeting with the Mo family's leader in Lu. The Mo leader won't be coming to Northern Jin."  

"Master Gongshu, whatever plans you have—"  

"Speak them plainly."  

"I will reject them all."  

"And show you that the name Gongshu—"  

"Will never overturn the heavens!"
