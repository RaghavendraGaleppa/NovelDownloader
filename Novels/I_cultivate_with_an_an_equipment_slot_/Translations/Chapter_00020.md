# Chapter 20: A Great Harvest  

When Bai Zhishi heard Zhang Yan's words, he immediately smiled.  

If Zhang Yan had made bold promises right away, Bai Zhishi wouldn't have believed him. But since Zhang Yan wanted to examine the condition of his spiritual plant, it suggested that he likely had genuine skills.  

"Junior Brother, take a look!"  

Bai Zhishi glanced around to ensure no one was nearby, then waved his hand, revealing a wilted spiritual plant. Beneath the plant was a white jade pot, exuding a faint spiritual glow.  

"This is actually white jade infused with spiritual energy!"  

Zhang Yan was astonished.  

Extravagant—this was truly extravagant! Just this jade pot alone was probably worth dozens of spirit stones.  

But the more valuable the pot, the more it proved the worth of the spiritual plant inside.  

Zhang Yan had some knowledge of spiritual plants, thanks to the insights provided by the attributes on his spiritual hoe, which allowed him to recognize most common ones. However, this orchid-like plant was something he had never seen or even heard of before.  

"Senior Brother Bai, I must admit my ignorance—I can't identify the origin of this spiritual plant," Zhang Yan said after observing it for a while, shaking his head.  

"Hahaha, Junior Brother, don't be modest. This is the Ice Moon Orchid, a rare first-grade superior spiritual herb. It's normal for you not to recognize it."  

"So that's it." Zhang Yan nodded in understanding. No wonder—it turned out to be a first-grade superior spiritual herb. Such herbs were worth at least two to three hundred spirit stones.  

If the herb had a special use, its price could double. The most expensive among them were the auxiliary ingredients for Foundation Establishment Pills. Though they were also first-grade superior herbs, each could fetch over a thousand spirit stones.  

Using a jade pot for such a precious plant was only fitting.  

"This is the Ice Moon Orchid?"  

Upon hearing Bai Zhishi's words, Zhang Yan's expression changed.  

He had initially thought it was just a rare first-grade superior herb, but he hadn't expected it to be the Ice Moon Orchid!  

The value of the Ice Moon Orchid wasn't much lower than that of the auxiliary ingredients for Foundation Establishment Pills—and for a simple reason: it was the main ingredient for the Beauty Preservation Pill.  

As everyone knew, women's pursuit of beauty transcended lifetimes, whether in the mortal world or the immortal realm.  

The Beauty Preservation Pill allowed female cultivators to preserve their appearance at its most beautiful moment, unchanged until their death.  

Theoretically, if one cultivated fast enough and reached a high enough realm, aging wouldn't catch up to them.  

But in reality, due to limitations in talent and other factors, this was nearly impossible to achieve. Thus, the Beauty Preservation Pill was a highly sought-after commodity in the cultivation world.  

After all...  

Foundation Establishment Pills might not be necessary for those with exceptional talent who sought to prove their path through divine abilities, but the Beauty Preservation Pill? Almost every female cultivator desired it!  

Regardless of age or talent.  

Even female cultivators with outstanding aptitudes found it hard to resist the allure of the Beauty Preservation Pill.  

A single batch of Beauty Preservation Pills could sell for at least ten thousand spirit stones.  

No wonder Bai Zhishi was so invested—this was indeed a significant opportunity.  

Moreover, Zhang Yan estimated that this Ice Moon Orchid was about thirty to forty years old. Bai Zhishi was undoubtedly aiming to cultivate it to fifty years.  

Only Ice Moon Orchids over fifty years old could serve as the main ingredient for Beauty Preservation Pills. Otherwise, they could only be refined into Nourishing Beauty Pills, which, while still valuable, paled in comparison to the Beauty Preservation Pill.  

Given its rarity, Zhang Yan had only heard of the Ice Moon Orchid but had never seen one before—not even Elder Lin had encountered it.  

Naturally, he couldn't recognize it at first glance.  

"Junior Brother, can you heal it?" Bai Zhishi asked nervously.  

Zhang Yan didn't answer immediately. Instead, he carefully examined the Ice Moon Orchid in his hands. On the surface, the plant appeared unharmed, but it was visibly wilted.  

After a moment of thought, Zhang Yan extended his hand, and a verdant glow emerged, slowly infusing into the Ice Moon Orchid.  

This was the Wood Element Technique.  

The pure wood elemental energy condensed by the technique could not only accelerate the growth of spiritual plants but also heal them—its effects on plants far surpassed those on humans.  

In just two breaths, the green glow in Zhang Yan's hand dissipated completely.  

And visibly, the Ice Moon Orchid had already improved.  

"Yes, the Ice Moon Orchid can be healed. One application of the Wood Element Technique per month for three months should suffice," Zhang Yan said with a nod.  

"Really?"  

"Absolutely."  

Zhang Yan nodded lightly. In truth, the Ice Moon Orchid had suffered root damage during excavation. For an ordinary spiritual botanist, healing it would require considerable effort.  

But for Zhang Yan, whose Wood Element Technique was nearly perfected, it was a trivial task.  

If he wanted to, he could have healed the Ice Moon Orchid right then and there.  

The reason he proposed three sessions was simple: Bai Zhishi was paying for this service. Spreading it out would make the cost easier to swallow.  

If Bai Zhishi saw how effortlessly Zhang Yan healed the plant, he might not be willing to pay a high price.  

Now, Zhang Yan had demonstrated his exceptional skill while also securing a commitment—if Bai Zhishi wanted his continued help, he would have to pay accordingly.  

"Excellent!"  

Seeing the revived vitality of the Ice Moon Orchid, Bai Zhishi's face lit up with excitement. "Then I'll trouble you, Junior Brother. I've prepared a small token of appreciation—please don't refuse."  

With that, Bai Zhishi handed Zhang Yan a storage pouch.  

"Since Senior Brother is so generous, I won't stand on ceremony!"  

Without hesitation, Zhang Yan accepted the pouch. Since it wasn't bound to anyone, he could easily sense its contents with a surge of his spiritual energy.  

Inside were over two hundred spirit stones, two bottles of pills, and countless varieties of spiritual plant seeds.  

All in all, the contents were worth at least three hundred spirit stones.  

Three hundred spirit stones!  

After three months of hard work—even taking advantage of the sect's resources—Zhang Yan had only earned a little over two hundred thirty spirit stones. Yet Bai Zhishi had handed him three hundred in one go.  

It was clear that Bai Zhishi was willing to pay a hefty price for this Ice Moon Orchid.  

Satisfied, Zhang Yan nodded. "Thank you, Senior Brother. I will do my utmost to heal the Ice Moon Orchid!"  

"Good, good! I'm glad you're satisfied. Then I'll seek you out again next month!" Seeing Zhang Yan accept the pouch, Bai Zhishi was even more delighted.  

After seeing Bai Zhishi off, Zhang Yan weighed the storage pouch in his hand.  

With Bai Zhishi's three hundred and the two hundred thirty-plus from harvesting spiritual rice, he now had over five hundred spirit stones.  

However, out of this sum, he needed to set aside over a hundred for leasing spiritual fields and purchasing farming tools—meaning his disposable income was around four hundred spirit stones.  

"Four hundred spirit stones... that's enough to buy quite a few things."  

Thinking of a certain piece of equipment he had been eyeing for a while, Zhang Yan's eyes gleamed with anticipation.
