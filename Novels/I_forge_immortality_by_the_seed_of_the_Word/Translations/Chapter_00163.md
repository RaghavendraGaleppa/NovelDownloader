# Chapter 160: Proud Cloud Immortal City

Echoes of terrified cries rose and fell around him.

Zhang Jing glanced at the cultivators frantically fleeing toward the ship's cabin on the deck and couldn't help but shake his head slightly.

In the face of such a terrifying existence,

escape was meaningless.

The key lay in whether the Void Treasure Ship could withstand the ordeal.

If the ship could safely pass through this calamity, then there was no need to flee; if it couldn't... then fleeing would be even more pointless.

Death would be inevitable either way.

At that moment,

perhaps only Qingyazi, at the Dao-Integration Realm, might survive aboard this ship.

Thinking this,

"What an unexpected disaster!" Zhang Jing couldn't help but force a bitter smile.

He then raised his head again, his gaze fixed on the unimaginably vast silhouette.

And this was only half of a wing.

The name unconsciously uttered by Qu Junhou flashed through his mind.

"Shanhai Butterfly? Is that what this being with half a sky-covering wing is called?"

A trace of awe flickered in Zhang Jing's eyes.

What kind of inconceivable existence was this—a Heavenly Immortal, or something even higher...

As he pondered,

The hundred-zhang-tall phantom of Qingyazi, with his dragon head and human body, quietly appeared above the ship's cabin. Divine light shone in his eyes, his expression grave.

He glanced briefly at the colossal shadow in the sky before quickly lowering his gaze,

as if afraid of offending the being.

In the next moment,

Qingyazi produced a peculiar Dao talisman in his hand—neither metal nor jade—inscribed with the seal script characters "Wanbao" (Ten Thousand Treasures).

Without hesitation,

he channeled all his immortal power into the talisman.

Instantly,

a strand of near-chaotic immortal light, seemingly condensed from countless radiant treasures, slowly emerged. It then expanded rapidly, soon becoming as bright as a great sun, illuminating the entire expanse of the dark void.

The raging void storm was instantly suppressed and calmed.

"Dao Lord Wanbao?"

A surprised exclamation rang out from the infinite heights, laced with palpable fear.

......

An immeasurable amount of time passed.

Everything returned to calm.

The Void Treasure Ship continued its slow journey through the boundless void.

Only Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou remained on the deck.

"Brother Qu, you didn't return to the cabin either?" Zhang Jing asked with a smile.

"Return? As if!" Qu Junhou rolled his eyes, still visibly shaken. "Against such an existence, what difference does it make whether you're in the cabin or on the deck?"

"The only hope for survival lies with the Wanbao Immortal Sect."

"But it seems our luck isn't bad."

Qu Junhou slowly exhaled in relief.

"By the way, Brother Qu, I heard you mention something about a Shanhai Butterfly earlier. What exactly—" Zhang Jing suddenly turned to him, curiosity evident in his voice.

"Ah, did I say that?" Qu Junhou's expression froze.

Meeting Zhang Jing's gaze, he nodded emphatically.

"Haha, well... I happened to come across some information about this being in the Dao Repository Secret Realm. It just came to mind when I saw it. According to the records, it's a great being from the Primordial Chaos Profound Heaven."

Qu Junhou offered a sheepish smile, speaking vaguely.

"Brother Zhang, I have matters to attend to. I'll take my leave first."

With that,

he clasped his hands in farewell and hurried toward the cabin,

his steps somewhat unsteady.

Left behind,

Zhang Jing slowly withdrew his gaze, a meaningful expression on his face.

"So it's a being from the Primordial Chaos Profound Heaven? And this Brother Qu seems to have some secrets of his own."

As for Qu Junhou's claim about reading about the Shanhai Butterfly in the Dao Repository Secret Realm,

Zhang Jing didn't believe a single word of it.

......

Time flowed steadily.

Over the next month,

the Void Treasure Ship traveled uneventfully toward the Proud Cloud Immortal City in the Dongzhen Huamiao Heaven, encountering no further mishaps.

Zhang Jing stood on the deck.

In his field of vision,

a vast world brimming with dense immortal qi gradually appeared. Its heavy and majestic aura spread in all directions, its radiant immortal light illuminating the boundless, desolate void.

"Dongzhen Huamiao Heaven—we've arrived!"

The thought crossed his mind.

The tension he had carried all this time finally began to ease.

Surely no foolhardy being would dare intercept a human Void Treasure Ship here.

......

On an endless plain,

stood a sprawling immortal city stretching thousands of miles in all directions. Populated by countless immortals, its luminous glow shone day and night, painting the sky like a celestial kingdom on earth.

Built around the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, it was aptly named the Proud Cloud Immortal City.

At the city's heart,

lay a vast thousand-acre plaza paved with dark stones that emitted a faint, eerie glow. The weathered marks of wind and rain on its surface spoke of its ancient history.

At this moment,

a Void Treasure Ship hovered silently above the plaza. Streaks of light shot out from the ship, landing on the ground and transforming into human figures.

These individuals wore varied expressions—

some eager and excited, others anxious and uneasy, each unique in their own way.

"So this is the Proud Cloud Immortal City. That gate must be the entrance to the legendary Proud Cloud Secret Realm."

Zhang Jing landed lightly, his gaze shifting forward.

Memories of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm's details surfaced in his mind.

Before him,

stood a simple, semicircular stone archway nearly a hundred zhang tall, quietly positioned at the center of the plaza. The black archway alternated between solid and illusory, appearing particularly peculiar and unstable.

Just then,

a golden streak of light landed softly beside Zhang Jing.

"Brother Zhang, the Proud Cloud Secret Realm won't open for another half-month. Shall we find a place to settle in first?"

"My thoughts exactly."

Zhang Jing nodded.

......

Before long,

in an area just a few miles from the Proud Cloud Secret Realm's entrance,

artificial hills stretched into the distance, with small bridges arching over flowing streams and towering trees forming shaded canopies. Exotic spirit flowers and immortal herbs competed in beauty, their delicate fragrances refreshing the mind and spirit.

Amid the lush greenery,

small, exquisitely crafted palaces came into view.

Zhang Jing paused, a faint trace of satisfaction crossing his face.

Behind him,

a charming female cultivator in white robes, at the Golden Core Realm, continued her enthusiastic pitch:

"Gentlemen, these palaces were specially built by our immortal city for Foundation Establishment geniuses participating in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm. The environment is serene, the immortal qi abundant, and the proximity to the secret realm makes it perfect for rest."

"Remember, the secret realm trials consist of multiple rounds. Having a good place to recuperate between rounds allows for faster recovery of energy and focus, giving you an edge over others."

"With your talents, you're bound to rank within the top hundred in the Foundation Establishment tier. Every rank higher means more fate energy—imagine the gains!"

Seeing no response from Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou,

the woman, as if recalling something, quickly played her final card:

"To be frank, only three palaces remain here, and the inner city has almost no vacant residences or caves left."

"If you miss this chance, you'll have to stay in the outer city. Even the closest cave there is four to five hundred miles from the secret realm's entrance."

Hearing this,

Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou exchanged a glance.

They nodded simultaneously.

They could tell the woman wasn't lying.

Given the circumstances,

they had little choice but to rent here.

As she had said,

the Proud Cloud Secret Realm trials consisted of multiple rounds.

Why choose to travel back and forth from the outer city when a closer residence was available?

"How much fate energy is required?"

Zhang Jing asked softly.

At this,

the woman's face blossomed into an exceedingly warm smile as she replied gently,

"Not much, just—"

But before she could finish, a mild voice interrupted.

"Hold on!"

Zhang Jing turned toward the sound.

Three figures—two men and a woman, all at the Foundation Establishment Realm—were approaching with faint smiles.

"The aura fluctuations... Disciples of the Zhou Tian Star God Hall!"

Zhang Jing's eyes flickered slightly.

The Zhou Tian Star God Hall, like the Supreme Oneness Infinite Dao Sect, was one of humanity's seven supreme orthodoxies, renowned for its Three Hundred Sixty-Five Zhou Tian Star Gods.

Now,

the trio opposite seemed to recognize Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou as well.

The leading man said with a smile,

"So it's fellow disciples from the Supreme Oneness Infinite Dao Sect. Our apologies. Since there are only three palaces left here, and we happen to be three people, how about—"

Though his tone was polite,

the implied meaning was anything but friendly.

Hearing this,

Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou exchanged another glance.

A strange smile flashed across their faces.
