# Chapter 497: Baiting the Hook

In the very center of the diagram, nine ancient and vigorous characters, seemingly containing the might of thunder, shone brilliantly. They carried a battle intent that could cleave the heavens and was eternal, indestructible.

*Divine Firmament Nine Firmaments Mystic穹 Indestructible True Scripture!*

As the diagram circulated, specific true meanings of the Dao manifested below the golden characters.

"It corresponds to the ninefold supreme palaces of the Divine Firmament above and forges the indestructible golden body of the Mystic穹 in cultivation below. This scripture is the嫡传 true transmission of the Primordial Divine Firmament True Lord's Dao lineage, a supreme true method for battle and slaughter.

"It must引 the ninefold Heavenly Gang Thunderfire to cleanse and refine the five viscera and six bowels. It接引 the killing qi of the Zhoutian Metal to forge the bones, cast the meridians, and grind the marrow, making the physical body transparent and flawless, as if forged from divine iron. The skin is refined like golden crystals, the bones are forged like divine jade, the viscera transform into thunder ponds, and the blood contains stellar flames...

"When cultivated to perfection, one can grasp and shatter divine firmament thunder with a mere lift of a hand. With a flicker of the third eye between the eyebrows, divine light erupts and can split a thousand mountains and ten thousand peaks. The physical body's strength can rival that of a先天 spiritual treasure.

"A thousand methods cannot invade; water and fire retreat."

The light and shadow of the diagram shifted, and a majestic, heaven-propping and earth-supporting figure condensed within it.

Its face was blurry, yet it exuded boundless majesty. A vertical eye between its eyebrows opened and closed, unleashing divine light that could split the heavens and the earth, shattering stars as if they were mere pellets.

In its hand, a phantom of a three-pointed, two-bladed divine spear, inscribed with ten thousand thunder talismans and entwined with mystical qi, tore through the void. Wherever it passed, the sea would split, its true meaning fierce and tyrannical, piercing through realms.

This was clearly the supreme profound martial intent of the Primordial Dao lineage's Guardian War God lineage.

Seeing Xu Yunfan become engrossed in this true scripture, Lü Chunyang said, "This battle scripture requires引 the primordial qi of the nine heavens' metal to temper the divine body. It is profound and abstruse, its power vast. It is compatible with the foundation of your Primordial Sect. Apart from the exquisite methods represented by the *Eight Sceneries of the Mysterious Capital Cloud Sutra for Forging Heaven and Creation*, it follows another path of extreme ferocity, belonging to the ranks of the Primordial Sect's most顶尖 inheritances."

Xu Yunfan came back to his senses, his expression excited as he asked, "Senior, why do you possess this method?"

Lü Chunyang said nonchalantly, "During the great war of the three sects back then, I used three sword intents to pierce through the Primordial Sect's Divine Firmament Nine Firmaments, tearing its洞天 asunder, causing its Golden Core to fall forever, unable to emerge from the cycle of reincarnation for ten thousand generations."

As he spoke, he couldn't help but sigh in admiration, "That fellow's法 body was truly formidable. If I hadn't had a sword intent专门 to attack the soul, I'm afraid I would have let him escape."

Seeing the disappointment in Xu Yunfan's eyes, Lü Chunyang laughed and scolded, "Don't underestimate this true scripture. Back then, it was connected to the Primordial Sect's Dao Lord. Moreover, that Divine Firmament Nine Firmaments True Lord had terrible talent. This true scripture was like a pearl cast before a pig when it was in his hands."

Xu Yunfan asked, "Senior, and what about me?"

"You..."

Lü Chunyang shook his head. "Your aptitude is even worse than that of the Divine Firmament Nine Firmaments True Lord. Your innate bone structure is of the lowest grade. Although it has been altered quite a bit in the later stages, it's still somewhat lacking. The fact that you've been able to enter the Foundation Establishment stage is already a testament to your deep fortune."

Xu Yunfan forced a smile. "...Is that so? Haha, haha."

A meaningful smile curled at the corner of Lü Chunyang's mouth as he looked up, his gaze seeming to pierce through the void and land on a certain existence.

"If that fellow Qingyuan knew that you had散尽 your *True Warrior Subduing Demons True Scripture*'s martial arts Buddhist fetus to cultivate this Divine Firmament scripture I gave you... hehehe..."

Lü Chunyang really wanted to see Qingyuan True Lord's expression upon hearing the news.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but ask, "Senior, won't I be slapped to death by that Qingyuan True Lord?"

"No, the karma has already been severed by me. If he were to forcibly make a move," Lü Chunyang glanced at Xu Yunfan and said淡淡ly, "The three sword intents on your body would teach him what a sword cultivator is."

Xu Yunfan: "..."

This was using him as bait.

Lü Chunyang said, "The position of 'Divine Firmament Mystic穹司雷道君'承ed by this true scripture is a supreme throne of the Primordial Dao lineage's Guardian War God lineage.

"The old fellow who held the title 'Divine Firmament Nine Firmaments True Lord' back then, relying on a bit of skill in thunder arts, sat on this throne. I used three sword intents to pierce his洞天 and sever his soul, beating him so hard that his throne shattered and went into hiding, never daring to show himself again!"

A cold light hung on his lips, as if savoring the storms of blood and rain from the great war of the three sects. After a good while, he continued.

"This throne is powerful, but it is not easily obtained.

"The Way of Heaven is supremely fair. The path to the apex cannot be taken lightly. To reforge this throne, one must use the true scripture as a vessel, step by step rebuilding the rituals in the red dust of ten thousand worlds. It requires引 stellar metal to temper the bones,纳 the thunderfire of the nine heavens to refine the golden body, using the most yang and刚 methods to forge an 'Indestructible Dao Body'. More importantly, one must use one's own Dao to connect to the nine firmaments palaces of the Divine Firmament, until the dormant throne's brand resonates and descends.

"The hardship involved is even greater than moving mountains and filling seas!"

"..."

After Xu Yunfan was sent out of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect by Lü Chunyang, he didn't dare to linger. After all, this was the righteous sect territory of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

Although Senior Chunyang's combat prowess was formidable, he was subtly ostracized by the other True Lords of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect. If he didn't leave early, he might have stirred up unnecessary trouble.

Furthermore, his *True Warrior Subduing Demons True Scripture* had been taken away, leaving him with only his cultivation level. Although he had the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi to protect him, not inferior to his peers, the loss of a trump card left him feeling a bit hollow inside.

Xu Yunfan naturally wanted to return to the Cold Crow Pass as quickly as possible to comprehend the *Divine Firmament Nine Firmaments Mystic穹 Indestructible True Scripture*.

At almost the same time, at the base of the nameless mountain peak in the Eastern Wasteland where the先天 stone fetus had fallen.

Sanzang took one step after another, footprints sinking into the ground, and walked to the mountainside, where the Gangfeng was as sharp as a blade.

This former true disciple of the Buddhist sect was now hunched. His moon-white monk's robes were torn into strips by the demonic wind.

He walked barefoot over the jagged, sharp-edged rocks, the soles of his feet leaving a trail of blood.

With every step he took, a faint golden Buddhist seal was imprinted on the rock, only to be covered by the newly涌 bloodstains.

Sanzang was actually using his mortal body as a brush and his essence blood as ink, slowly activating a ritual.

After an unknown amount of time, the nameless mountain peak finally appeared before Sanzang's eyes.

At this moment, Sanzang was as thin as a skeleton. There was no longer any Buddhist power flowing in his breath, only the rock-solid resolve and indifference between his eyebrows.

He raised a hand to wipe the blood and sweat from his temple, his枯瘦 fingers gripping the exposed rock face as he began to climb, one step at a time.

Pebbles簌簌 rolled down. The demonic wind whipped sand and gravel against his back, but he seemed oblivious to it all.

Finally, his blood-stained hand reached the summit.

The several-zhang-tall玄黄 boulder was right before his eyes. The "swastika" Buddhist seal deep within the stone fetus sensed his arrival and suddenly burst with an unprecedented, intense golden brilliance.

The entire summit shook violently. Countless dark golden Sanskrit characters on the boulder's surface writhed like living things. Where stone chips簌簌 fell away, a human-like轮廓 was faintly revealed!

Stone chips flew like rain.

Just as Sanzang's blood-stained hand was about to touch the玄黄 boulder, he heard a密集 commotion from afar, approaching quickly.

He turned his head to look.

"Swish! Swish! Swish!"

Dozens of gray shadows, carried by a foul wind, nimbly climbed and leaped up from the cliffs and steep walls.

They were actually a group of red-eyed ghost apes, born in the sheer cliffs of the Eastern Wasteland, with天生 keen spiritual senses.

The leader, a particularly雄壮 old ape, first glanced at Sanzang, then turned to look at the先天 stone fetus that was emitting a faint silver light. Its暗金 eyes reflected the strange phenomena of the stone fetus, and it seemed to be invisibly drawn. Its giant, black-furred爪, filled with curiosity and instinct, was the first to重重 press onto the surface of the scorching stone fetus before Sanzang could.
