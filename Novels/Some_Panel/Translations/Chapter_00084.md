## Chapter 83: Mahayana Cultivator, Chun Ye

"Thank you this time. I didn't expect you to have a True Disciple sister," Yang Ji said, cupping his hands to the girl in the fitted attire after they exited the Assessment and Mission Hall.

"Are you thanking me or my sister?" the girl in the fitted attire asked, glancing sideways.

"Naturally, both," Yang Ji chuckled.

"There's no need for thanks. You saved my life, so let's call it even, how about that?" the girl in the fitted attire said, looking at him.

"Oh? Are you trying to distance yourself from a 'favored' disciple like me?" Yang Ji teased, chuckling.

"That's not it. We both come from the Boundless Sea, so naturally, we should be closer and help each other more in the future," the girl in the fitted attire admitted. "I admit I had some prejudice against you before, but you truly surprised me. With average aptitude and root bone, your comprehension is exceptionally outstanding. I even suspect if you were possessed by some old monster?" She scrutinized Yang Ji from head to toe, as if trying to see through him.

"Haha, if an old monster's soul entered my body and saw my aptitude, they'd probably burst into tears on the spot, curse, kick me, and run away. How could they possibly possess me?" Yang Ji laughed.

"That's true. Your root bone is indeed a bit inferior. I reached the peak of Golden Core after more than twenty years of cultivation, while you took over a hundred years to reach it. When we meet again, I'll probably have left you far behind," the girl in the fitted attire said, slightly lifting her chin.

"It seems in order not to be left too far behind by you, I'll have to find some spiritual treasures that can improve my root bone," Yang Ji said, not disheartened at all, but instead smiling calmly.

"You really should find more spiritual items that can improve your root bone. Otherwise, for the same cultivation realm, you'll have to spend hundreds or even thousands of more years of arduous cultivation to break through. That's no different from committing suicide; it's not worth it." The girl in the fitted attire spoke quite directly, without any pretense or affectation. Her straightforward manner, combined with her neat attire, gave her a rather heroic and dashing demeanor.

"I've had this plan for a while, but I'll have to take it slow," Yang Ji naturally understood the reasoning behind it.

"Oh, right, since we passed the first assessment, we're qualified to go to the Dao Tower to claim a top-tier spell or cultivation method. As for great divine abilities and Dao-level cultivation methods, we can also claim one scroll of each," the white-haired elder said.

"I won't go. It's best to specialize in one thing; biting off more than you can chew is not good. The spells and cultivation methods I have are already enough. You all go ahead." As the girl in the fitted attire spoke, she swept her storage bag and pulled out a golden communication talisman, handing it to Yang Ji. "This is a communication talisman. Within a certain range, I can contact you through it, and you can contact me. We both come from the Boundless Sea, so we're fellow townsfolk. Let's keep in touch in the future. If you have time, you can visit the Luo River Heavenly Domain. I'll introduce you to my sister and some friends. Expanding your social circle will be beneficial to you."

"It would be my honor to get to know a True Disciple," Yang Ji nodded, chuckling. "By the way, I still don't know your name."

"Yan Zhan, a genius woman who will eventually become a True Disciple. In the future, above this firmament, there will be a heavenly domain for me," the girl in the fitted attire suddenly declared proudly, hands behind her back.

"Yang Ji!" Yang Ji smiled, also revealing his name.

"Mm, I'll remember you. I'm leaving now. Let's keep in touch in the future." With that, Yan Zhan glanced at him, then soared into the sky, disappearing into the depths of the white clouds.

"Oh, right, what about you all?" Yang Ji suddenly looked at the white-haired elder and the others. Some matters had caused delays earlier, and he hadn't yet asked for their names.

"Venerable Master, my name is Chong Yuan," the white-haired elder said.

"My name is Shan Hai," the black-haired elder said.

"My name is Jian Sen," the gloomy youth said.

"My name is Wei Feng," the refined middle-aged man said.

"I am Wei Ming," the smiling youth said.

"My name is Hai Kun," the burly man said.

Yang Ji nodded. These six people actually had quite good talent; except for the white-haired elder, all of them possessed supreme root bones. Although Chong Yuan, the white-haired elder, only had a superior root bone, he was experienced and quite astute in handling matters, which Yang Ji valued greatly. If Yang Ji became an inner disciple in the future and entrusted the management of his mountain peak to Chong Yuan, it would save him a lot of worry.

"Having completed the first assessment, we will be able to stay in the Dao Sect for ten years. We must make good use of this decade to strengthen our own power and strive to pass the next assessment together," Yang Ji swept his gaze over the group and said, "Let's go, we'll head to the Cultivation Method Hall to claim our methods."

"Yes, Venerable Master," the group nodded, then flew towards the Cultivation Method Hall, which was also the Dao Tower.

The Dao Sect had over a million disciples, and matters concerning their benefits had to be sought out themselves. No one would revolve around you unless you were a Dao Child or a True Disciple. For example, when claiming cultivation methods or pills, the sect wouldn't send someone to deliver the items to your hands. You needed to take your Dao Sect token to claim them, with the completed assessment tasks serving as proof. Only disciples who passed the first assessment task were qualified to enjoy the sect's basic rights and resources.

At this moment, they followed the sect map within the Dao Sect token and headed towards the Dao Tower. Teleportation arrays were laid out everywhere within the sect, connecting to the underground spirit veins. One could teleport directly without paying spirit stones, making travel quite convenient. After several teleports, in a short while, the group was transported near the Dao Tower. Then they leaped up and flew several more *li* forward.

Amidst the clouds ahead, a seven-storied tower, faintly discernible and shimmering with spiritual light, appeared. It stood like a massive mountain peak, piercing the sky and quietly towering over the land. This magnificent tower was the Dao Tower, also known as the Cultivation Method Hall.

"The book 'Boundless Dao Sect' said this Dao Tower is a sentient supreme Dao Artifact. I wonder if that's true?" Yang Ji murmured.

"This is a vital area of the Dao Tower; flying is forbidden! Who is flying? Hurry and come down!" At this moment, a shout came from below.

Yang Ji knew his limits. He led the group to land on the outskirts of the Dao Tower, then walked forward and bowed to two Nascent Soul realm tower guards. "Greetings, two senior brothers. We have passed the first assessment and are here to claim our cultivation methods."

"Passed the assessment? Go on in," one of the tower guards said indifferently.

"Heh, Elder Chun Ye is getting drunk alone inside and was just worrying about not having anyone to drink with. You all came at just the right time," another disciple chuckled softly.

Yang Ji had learned from the book 'Boundless Dao Sect' that Elder Chun Ye was the guardian of the Dao Tower, and claiming cultivation methods and spells required his permission. Yang Ji nodded at the two senior brothers, then led the group slowly into the tower. They hadn't walked far when they heard a sorrowful, melancholic sound coming from within.

"Ask what love is in this world? I'm infatuated with her, yet she ignores me..."

"Gulp!"

"Gulp!"

From a distance, Yang Ji saw a seemingly dashing and handsome middle-aged man guzzling wine. He wore a purple robe, his long hair flowed loosely, his eyes held three parts wild arrogance and seven parts drunken infatuation. Word by word, he murmured phrases about deep affection not betraying one's beloved, yet the beloved betraying that deep affection, stirring sympathy and sadness in anyone who heard him.

Who else could this handsome, unrestrained, and unconventional person be but Chun Ye?
