# Chapter 20: Pursuit

“Just remember to teach me the Sunrise Primordial Breath Art.”

“Rest assured, I, Li Haomiao, am a man of my word. Once we leave this eight-hundred-mile desolate ice plain, I will naturally teach you.”

Xu Yunfan stopped pressing the matter upon hearing this. Although Li Haomiao seemed somewhat unreliable and even afraid of ghosts, he had, so far, kept his promises.

Soon, Fang Mushan returned empty-handed, looking rather embarrassed.

“Sorry about that, you two. Prey is hard to come by these days. I went looking, but wait?!”

His eyes widened in shock as he stared at the whole sheep roasting over the fire.

“Where did that come from?”

Xu Yunfan remained calm, slowly turning the roasting sheep.

“Thanks to Brother Fang’s guidance. I went out and happened to see this bighorn sheep. I landed a lucky shot on its vital point and managed to get this prey. I thought there wouldn't be any animals left in this eight-hundred-mile desolate plain, but it seems I was wrong. I thought we were going to have to eat moss.”

Fang Mushan was stunned for a long moment and subconsciously exchanged a look with Li Haomiao. Li Haomiao calmly looked away. Fang Mushan sighed.

“I get it. This is a newbie’s blessing.”

Fang Mushan muttered to himself. When newcomers enter a certain field, like fishing, their first catch is always bigger and more plentiful than others'.

“Tomorrow,” Fang Mushan murmured, “you won’t be so lucky tomorrow.”

Li Haomiao nodded in firm agreement.

After the meal, Xu Yunfan used the plant juice Fang Mushan had collected to tan the bighorn sheep’s hide. After hanging it up to dry, he picked up his iron pickaxe again and began digging deep holes, relentlessly tempering his Copper Body Art and increasing his proficiency.

He had consumed the majority of the Hunger-Pacifying Pills. It seemed that it would only be a few more days before his Copper Body Art reached Great Perfection.

Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan had grown accustomed to seeing Xu Yunfan swinging his pickaxe to dig deep holes.

Li Haomiao said lazily, “If you want to achieve Great Perfection in the Copper Body Art, you need to practice it with secret medicines. If you just bury your head in mindless training and use hammer techniques to temper your body, you’ll only end up injuring yourself in the end.”

Without looking back, Xu Yunfan continued to swing his pickaxe.

“You know nothing about hammers.”

“...”

By convention, many martial arts require external aids, especially those that also temper the body. If he had secret medicines to assist him, his training efficiency would surely increase further. Xu Yunfan was helpless but not discouraged. Since he had already acquired the skill, as long as he persisted, it was only a matter of time before he mastered it.

Moreover, there was the Obscure Word Art, which was profound and difficult to understand, filled with Taoist allusions and terminology. If not for the Mind Imprint technique and the Attribute Panel, he would likely need a high-ranking Taoist master who had spent decades studying the Taoist Canon just to be qualified to understand it.

After exhausting himself by training the Copper Body Art, he rested for about ten minutes before sitting down to form hand seals. He silently recited the Supreme Goodness Like Water Heart Mantra in his mind, gradually entering a state that was neither empty nor void.

*You practiced the Obscure Word Art once, grasping its meaning superficially. It felt as if you gained some insight, but upon careful reflection, you found nothing.*
*You held your breath and focused your mind, practicing the Obscure Word Art. A flash of inspiration seemed to appear in your mind, but it vanished before you could capture it.*
*...*

The Obscure Word Art also included a visualization diagram, but unfortunately, he had yet to enter its gate and grasp its essence.

After concentrating intensely for half an hour, he had reached his limit. To continue would truly harm his spirit.

The only consolation was that since cultivating the Obscure Word Art, even though he had not yet mastered it, his sleep quality had become excellent. No matter how exhausted he was during the day, he would wake up the next morning fully refreshed and full of vigor.

After his cultivation, Xu Yunfan, fighting off his drowsiness, climbed out of the deep tunnel he had dug. Under the gaze of Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan, he rolled over to a corner, laid down on the wild grass he had gathered during the day, and fell into a deep sleep.

“Magistrate Yang, are you sure they dug this?”

A middle-aged man with a mustache, clad in armor and leaning on a long sword, looked at the nearby cave being inspected by Yang Gan with utter disbelief.

Yang Gan’s eye twitched. He reached out and carefully pinched the soil.

“The soil is fresh. It was dug in the last few days. And... there are traces of a fire in the hearth where animals were roasted, which is enough to prove they stayed here.”

“This cave is big enough to shelter six or seven people, and they even carved out a hearth. It would take at least two or three skilled martial artists a whole night to do this. Magistrate Yang, are you saying they did nothing all day but dig this cave?”

Yang Gan said in a deep voice, “Magistrate Xu, with my years of tracking and hunting experience, this is indeed a newly dug cave, and it was dug with a pickaxe. It came from Ningguta, and it is definitely the path taken by the Prince of Yan. I heard that Fang Mushan is also with them.”

“Fang Mushan...”

Magistrate Xu pinched his mustache in thought.

“The son of Grand General Fang Wen. I’ve heard of him. He was born with supernatural strength. If he were digging, it would make sense for him to finish a cave like this in a few hours. But what’s the point?”

Just then, a head popped out from a pit below the cave.

“Reporting to the officials, there is another tunnel inside the cave, at least forty meters long, and there is a medium-sized space inside.”

Yang Gan: “...”

He could hardly believe what he had just heard. The Prince of Yan was in the midst of an escape, yet he had the free time to dig such a huge cave?

Magistrate Xu’s eyes narrowed as he looked at Yang Gan.

“Magistrate Yang, if this is a mistake and we fail to capture the Prince of Yan, we will all be held accountable. Especially you, Magistrate Yang. You signed a military order. If it doesn't pan out, given General Zhang's temper, he’ll probably have your head displayed on a pike.”

Yang Gan’s heart skipped a beat. He let out a cold snort and stood up. “The Yang family has built its reputation on tracking and hunting. My ancestors once tracked game for the late emperor. We have our own unique methods. This is definitely not a mistake. It is the trail they left behind.”

A silence fell over the group, and no one said anything more.

Zhang Shuyang had temporarily assigned thirty elite soldiers to Yang Gan, but that didn't mean he was in command. Strictly speaking, Yang Gan was just a guide.

Even if he was just a guide, the patrol led by Magistrate Xu had no choice but to go in the direction Yang Gan pointed.

After the group rested for a night in this mountain depression, they continued their rapid march. When they tracked the group to the next location and saw an even larger cave than the previous one, Yang Gan’s eye began to twitch uncontrollably.

Someone in the group couldn't help but mutter, “Do they have endless energy? In this freezing environment, they have the leisure to dig out several rooms?”

Yang Gan pinched the fresh soil under his feet and murmured, “We’re getting close. This cave was dug at most two days ago.”

He was憋了一肚子气 (holding a belly full of anger), after all, having his professional tracking skills doubted was a great humiliation.

He would definitely settle the score when the time came.
