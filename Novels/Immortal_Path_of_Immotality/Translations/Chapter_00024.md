# Chapter 24: Gazing Across Realms

The space around him stretched infinitely, collapsing layer upon layer like dominoes. In the blink of an eye, the world turned into a monotonous gray, leaving him standing alone at its center as if time had frozen.

Though there was nothing visible in the endless void ahead, Lin Shan could distinctly sense an ancient, unfathomable gaze scrutinizing him. Like a magnet, it drew his eyes, rendering him unable to think or speak.

The terrifying will didn't stir violent waves, yet its immense pressure filled the void. His body trembled violently, his flesh seeming unable to bear the weight. Even from billions of miles away, that gaze conveyed an indifference that pierced through eternity, judging the cycle of life and death.

The surrounding space continuously shattered and reformed. Silver serpents flickered in the chaotic void beyond the mirror-like surface, nebulae appearing and disappearing. Wisps of mist seeped through spatial rifts—cold, desolate, and nightmarish.

Lin Shan stood facing the terrifying will across realms!

...

It might have been millennia, or perhaps just an instant.

A cold wind blew into the desolate mountain temple, jolting Lin Shan awake as if from a dream. 

Coming to his senses, he couldn't tell whether something had just happened or not. The Buddha statue still sat solemnly on its altar, candle flames swaying in the wind, the temple windows creaking under the mountain breeze.

That terrifying will had long since vanished.

Checking the upper right corner of his panel, Lin Shan saw 2 additional points of Ancient Charm. His back was drenched in sweat.

The Buddha of the Immortal Realm might have noticed him just now—or perhaps it was merely a casual glance across realms. But the terror of falling into that endless void left him shaken for a long time.

This was a warning!

The Buddha manifested in countless forms across infinite worlds with trillions of devotees. Naturally, he wouldn't waste effort targeting an ant. In the span of a million years, a mortal with a mere few decades of life was but a mayfly in the ocean, unworthy of remembrance.

Yet that didn't mean he would remain indifferent to stolen faith power.

This time, the amount taken—equivalent to just two points of Ancient Charm—was likely less than a drop in the ocean to him, warranting only a warning glance.

Lin Shan didn't dare gamble on what might happen if he tried stealing from the Buddha again.

"What a reckless fool I've been!"

Lin Shan cursed himself inwardly. Ever since tasting success in the ancient tomb, he'd grown arrogant. First, he'd nearly died at Scarface's hands, and now he'd recklessly provoked an unfathomable being like the Buddha!

"This world runs deeper than I imagined. Beyond every expert lies a greater one; beyond the highest heavens lies the Immortal Realm. And in that realm exist beings like the Buddha, for whom crushing me would be no harder than squashing an ant."

Lin Shan bowed deeply to the golden Buddha statue again, expressing reverence in hopes the great being would be magnanimous—though the Buddha likely couldn't care less.

As for the Ancient Charm? What's eaten is eaten—no way he'd spit it back out!

Resting in the ancient temple, Lin Shan tossed and turned, feeling uneasy under the Buddha's unseen gaze. Eventually, he grabbed his bundle and left the mountain that very night.

...

Two days later, Lin Shan returned to Zangke City.

Dust-covered and exhausted, he headed straight to his rented courtyard and collapsed into sleep.

The past days had drained him completely—first the life-and-death struggle amid the cultivators' battle in the Yelang ancient tomb, then the deadly fight with Scarface at the cave entrance, and finally the Buddha's terrifying gaze across realms.

"Life's been rough lately," Lin Shan mused bitterly.

After sleeping through to next morning, his first thought was how to convert his Ancient Charm into tangible power.

Having witnessed cultivators in battle, Lin Shan had been pondering—if immortality cultivation existed, why bother with martial arts? Even the greatest mortal warriors turned to dust when their century-long lifespan ended.

Immortality!

That single word alone ignited a blazing fire in Lin Shan's heart.

Back in the Lin Manor, he'd had neither foundation nor talent, merely surviving day to day. But now with his cheat-like enhancement panel—even capable of stealing from the Buddha—his ambitions soared.

A bold conjecture had taken root: perhaps he could enhance his way into an immortal cultivation manual!

His enhancement panel broke conventional rules, allowing limitless upgrades. Moreover, his tomb discoveries suggested that peak mortal martial arts corresponded to low-grade magical artifacts used by cultivators, implying proximity between the systems.

Further enhancement might yield a cultivation manual!

Lin Shan's Ancient Charm had totaled 16 points after leaving the tomb. He'd spent 2 points during his fight with Scarface, but regained 2 from the Buddha statue, leaving him with 16 again.

Taking out the Evergreen Art, he opened the enhancement panel:

[Evergreen Art]
Quality: Peak Mortal Technique
Description: Can cultivate to peak Xiantian realm, significantly boosting cultivation speed with mild life-extending effects. Cultivates profound, enduring true qi capable of healing meridian injuries.
Derived Technique: Severing Life Palm—strikes disrupt enemy's vitality; when applied to plants, extracts life force for healing.
Enhancement Cost: 8 points

"Everything hinges on this!"

Heart pounding, Lin Shan would soon learn whether his theory held.

"Enhance!"

Brilliant cyan light flooded the room as the manual's pages flipped autonomously, its contents vanishing to become blank. Upon reaching the end, the book turned ethereal, pages reversing as silver, tadpole-like characters reappeared—profound and cryptic.

Snap! The newly transformed manual closed, its glow fading.

The enhancement panel updated:

[Evergreen Wood Immortal Canon]
Quality: Qi Refining Cultivation Manual
Description: Wood-attributed cultivation scripture, cultivatable to 9th-layer Qi Refining. Produces gentle spiritual energy with minor herb-nurturing and strong healing properties.
Enhancement Cost: 16 points

"A Qi Refining cultivation manual!"

Lin Shan burst into exhilarated laughter.

Just as he'd predicted!

Why practice martial arts when immortality cultivation existed? Who wouldn't crave soaring through skies on swords or eternal life?

Settling cross-legged, he eagerly studied the manual. Though only three to five thousand characters, each demanded careful contemplation, requiring frequent pauses for reflection.

By the time he finished, night had fallen.

Having memorized the contents, Lin Shan knew the first step to becoming a cultivator was sensing spiritual energy—unlike martial arts' focus on circulating blood to refine true qi. Cultivation required first sensing ambient spiritual energy before gathering it into the dantian as personal "spiritual power."

Finding no issues, Lin Shan began attempting to sense spiritual energy—the foundational step toward immortality.

Rome wasn't built in a day. Step by step, he would walk the path of eternal life.

...

One hour passed.

Lin Shan remained unmoved. What kind of cultivator couldn't endure a little solitude?

...

Two hours passed.

This was nothing. Cultivation demanded patience, and Lin Shan remained steadfast.

...

Three hours passed.

Hmm, sensing spiritual energy proved more elusive than expected. After stretching, he resumed diligently.

...

A full night passed.

No pain, no gain!

...

Half a day later.

Persistence would bring success!

...

A full day passed.

Eyes bloodshot, Lin Shan refused to believe he couldn't clear cultivation's first hurdle.

...

Three days later.

Pale and parched, having eaten nothing for three days, Lin Shan collapsed weakly.

"Could it be... I lack cultivation talent?"
