# Chapter 6: The Demonic Sect's Cultivation Method

Stepping into the Scripture Pavilion, Lü Yang was immediately greeted by an elderly man in his sixties, idly reclining in a rocking chair, basking in the sun, and engrossed in a Taoist scripture.

The moment Lü Yang entered, the old man looked over.

"Another new disciple?"

The old man said indifferently, "Go inside and pick what you wish. Remember to follow the rules written within, or don't blame me for not warning you if you die."

"Thank you for your guidance, Senior."

Lü Yang cupped his hands and then walked towards the bookshelves.

Sure enough, as he approached, his disciple token at his waist seemed to sense something, emitting a faint glow before transforming into lines of text that appeared in the air.

"Lü Yang, Butian Peak disciple."

"You may freely claim the secret cultivation method of Butian Peak. Additionally, for your first technique exchange, you can opt for a loan with no down payment."

Lü Yang didn't hesitate and immediately claimed it.

The next second, the content of the cultivation method appeared on his disciple token. Lü Yang's mind quickly immersed itself in it, only returning to his senses after a long while.

"Why is this cultivation method, like the Innate Taoist Scripture, also divided into two parts, upper and lower?" Recalling the ending of his previous life, Lü Yang's expression turned somewhat grim. "The Dragon-Tiger Great Pleasure Rhapsody, when perfected, can refine a strand of Yin-Yang Dragon-Tiger Qi, ranking fifth grade. Theoretically, it's also a technique that directly leads to Foundation Establishment."

"However, what I received is only the Qi Refinement chapter!"

Having learned his lesson from his previous life, Lü Yang was extremely wary of such incomplete cultivation methods, even to the point of entertaining thoughts of abandoning its cultivation altogether.

But after a long period of contemplation, he sighed, "I still have to cultivate it!"

If he cultivates it, there might be hidden dangers in the future.
If he doesn't cultivate it, there might not even be a future.

Moreover, this demonic technique was indeed profoundly mysterious. Not only could it extract the target's vital essence, but it could also acquire the opponent's knowledge!
Cultivation methods, divine abilities, experience—he could extract them all!
"Furthermore, cultivators tormented by this technique will gradually have their minds controlled by the practitioner, making them utterly devoted and unable to extricate themselves, eventually becoming the practitioner's puppets, even willing to die for them. It truly is an exceedingly bizarre demonic art..."

Lü Yang meticulously studied the cultivation method, silently comprehending it.

Half an hour later, he finally attempted to circulate his energy. Two strands of True Qi flowed from his fingertips, forming a dragon and a tiger, subtly merging into a new form of True Qi...
"Ugh!"

The next second, Lü Yang's face paled, and the True Qi at his fingertips dissipated.

"Failed? That makes sense. Although I've mastered the theory, I haven't put it into practice yet."

Lü Yang wasn't discouraged. He turned his gaze to the dazzling array of bookshelves before him.

According to the rules of the Scripture Pavilion, as a newly admitted formal disciple, he had one opportunity to exchange a cultivation method or divine ability with a loan and no down payment.

To Lü Yang's surprise, the Scripture Pavilion contained more than just demonic techniques.

There were also many techniques clearly from orthodox renowned sects, covering an extremely wide range of fields: divination, sword arts, five-element spells—truly everything imaginable.

"Minor Heaven Interception Art, Supreme Grand Unity Five Elements Orthodox Method, Longevity True Explication, Divine Empyrean Sword True Art..."

Lü Yang spent a long time choosing before finally making his decision.

" 'Divine Empyrean Sword True Art', Price: 1000 Contribution Points."

"Detected that this is your first exchange. You may opt for a loan with no down payment, with an annual interest rate of thirty-six percent, to be repaid over ten years. Do you wish to proceed with the exchange?"

How much???

Lü Yang almost cursed out loud. An annual interest rate of 36% meant he would have to repay 460 Contribution Points per year, including principal and interest, which amounted to 4600 points over ten years!
Loan 1000, repay 4600?
This was blatant exploitation!

"Wait... I'm different!"

Lü Yang's eyes suddenly lit up. A high-interest loan with no down payment might be a bottomless pit for others, but for him, it was completely irrelevant.
Worst case scenario, he'd just start over. What did the loans from his previous life have to do with him?
So, if he wanted to, he could completely obtain the cultivation methods and divine abilities from the Scripture Pavilion for free!

Since he had no intention of repaying, Lü Yang became much calmer. He immediately waved his hand and, without even blinking, took out a loan to acquire the "Divine Empyrean Sword True Art."

Then, something unexpected happened.

Previously, when he obtained the secret demonic technique, the content was given directly. This time, however, Lü Yang only received a message:
"Cultivation method is being dispatched. Estimated delivery to your cave abode within three days."
"Please wait patiently."

Looking at the message on his disciple token, Lü Yang was somewhat puzzled. What did "cultivation method is being dispatched" mean? Was this cultivation method a unique copy, not even transcribed?

Despite his confusion, Lü Yang believed that the Initial Saint Sect wouldn't simply pocket his chosen method.

Before leaving, he sought out the old man at the entrance of the Scripture Pavilion again.

"Senior..."

As Lü Yang began to bow, the old man in the rocking chair spoke, "I'm not a senior. I'm also a disciple of the sect, just a bit older than you."

Lü Yang was startled upon hearing this, then corrected himself, "Senior Brother, do you know if there are any death-row prisoners in the sect suitable for us to use for cultivation?"

Being in a demonic sect, Lü Yang certainly held no notions of being unsullied by the mud, nor would he shy away from cultivating demonic arts. Anything that could make him stronger, he would utilize.

The old man glanced at Lü Yang upon hearing this, then suddenly asked, "Did you take out a loan for a cultivation method?"

Lü Yang paused, then nodded.

"Then you don't need to worry about that."

At this, a knowing smile appeared on the old man's face. "While these cultivation method loans are detestable, they aren't without their benefits..."
"Go back and wait!"

Lü Yang returned to his cave abode, completely bewildered.

However, he soon understood why the "Divine Empyrean Sword True Art" required dispatch time, and what the "benefit" the old man spoke of truly was.

Three days later, a box was delivered to the entrance of Lü Yang's cave abode.

Lü Yang carried the box inside and opened it.

Inside, he found a shapely, heroic woman with sharp phoenix eyes, her hands and feet bound, placed in the center of the box.

Though not of breathtaking beauty, the woman was naturally exquisite.
Her face, free of rouge, exuded a pure and ethereal elegance.
And because she had been confined in the stuffy box for too long, glistening beads of sweat clung to her, rolling down her fair neck and into her chest.

"Demonic path!"

The woman glared at Lü Yang, her eyes wishing to tear him to pieces. At the same time, she seemed to realize her impending fate, and despair flickered across her beautiful face.

Lü Yang frowned at her reaction. "You are... a disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion?"

"So what?" The woman closed her beautiful eyes, and two lines of clear tears slowly streamed down her pale cheeks. "Just kill me!"

Only then did Lü Yang understand.

The "Divine Empyrean Sword True Art" was a secret divine ability of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, the leading orthodox sect in the south. He had previously wondered where the Initial Saint Sect had obtained it.

Now he understood.

Demonic arts could replicate a target's knowledge and experience, and the Initial Saint Sect had directly procured a formal disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion for him.
In other words, if he wanted the "Divine Empyrean Sword True Art," he only needed to torment the other party.

"This way, it both imparts the cultivation method and solves the problem of disciples needing cultivation partners. It's hitting two birds with one stone, maximizing the utilization value..."

Making the best use of everything. This was indeed the style of the Saint Sect.
Compared to the arduous cultivation of orthodox sects, training intensely through winter and summer, this was truly the demonic sect's cultivation method.
