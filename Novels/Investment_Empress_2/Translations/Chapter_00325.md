# Chapter 325: The Bloody Clash (1/2)

The sound of Beijing opera, as if from a bygone era, still echoed in his ears.

Li Mo felt the northern wind brush against his face. The dark mass of the enemy formation seemed like a lake surface stirred into waves, filled with the ferocious and grotesque divine wills of various totemic spirits.

How did the rest of the song go?

His memory was hazy, and he had no time to dwell on it.

*Boom!*

He charged at the forefront, crashing into the enemy lines. The combined might of the sixty squads of soldiers made him akin to a deity. The Star-Shattering Pestle unleashed a tempest of violent energy, instantly shattering the dozens of warriors blessed with totemic power ahead of him. They turned into a rain of blood, which was finally blocked by the barrier of a malevolent turtle spirit totem.

The red mist sprayed out, seemingly carrying a lingering warmth.

Like a sharp spearhead, he plunged deeply into the encirclement of flesh and steel, charging toward his target.

The sound of shattering armor, dissolving flesh, and the roars of totem spirits all mixed together.

“For the Young Clan Leader!”

The vine shields parted, and a figure twice the height of a man rushed out. He was clad in heavy armor, and exposed parts of his body had grown hard shells. Behind him flickered the totem of the malevolent turtle just mentioned.

He was equivalent to an Inner Scenery martial artist, but without his own Inner Scenery. He had devoted everything to the spirit; the spirit was his Inner Scenery.

He swung his long-handled golden melon hammer, bringing it down with the roar of the malevolent turtle.

*Clang!*

A deafening explosion of metal shook the earth and swayed the mountains.

The golden melon hammer was shattered by the impact, and the shrapnel pierced through dozens of vine armors. Its owner met the same fate as Helian Wu. Even the manifestation of the malevolent turtle spirit flickered violently.

The war golems did not move quickly.

But at that moment, four distinct ones blocked the path. Going around them was not an option.

“Roar!”

One was a humanoid snake standing upright, one was a Huodou (Disaster Hound), one was a Zhuyan (Fierce Ape), and the last was the Blackwater Malevolent Turtle from before. They each buffed the warriors of their respective clans while simultaneously moving mechanically to crush this troop of cavalry.

It was like four small mountains collapsing.

Their targets were not solely Li Mo, but also the Greenwood Iron Cavalry following him.

As long as the iron cavalry suffered casualties, the formation power加持 (加持 - jiāchí - added/buffed) onto him would naturally weaken. By then, even if he were at the Outer Scenery realm, he would be surrounded and killed by the army.

“Mountain Stabilizing Chain!”

Li Mo’s Cloud Horse’s hooves generated smoke, slowing the already sluggish movements of the turtle golem. The Cloud Horse then ran straight up the pillar-like turtle leg.

A strike descended. Driven by the immense power of the military formation, spiderweb cracks instantly spread across the hard bronze, and a massive shockwave erupted from within.

This bronze statue, passed down for thousands of years, let out a groan of inability to bear the strain, collapsing like a mountain falling and a pillar toppling.

The shattered power of the populace within transformed into streams of black Yin souls, rushing out with the shockwave.

“The Turtle Venerable’s spirit manifestation is broken?!”

In front of the temporary palace, the Beast Hall Master crossed his arms, his pupils trembling in shock.

Even an Outer Scenery expert would find it difficult to shatter a totem golem.

Could this小子 (小子 - xiǎozi - young fellow) truly be completely withstanding the formation power of those thousands of iron cavalry?

“It’s not just that.”

Han Zhen’s blood-patterned arm continuously absorbed the blood energy of both sides.

The formation power of the Greenwood Iron Cavalry alone, even amplified by the Killing Heavenly Sound, wouldn’t be enough to achieve such a feat.

There is a great secret on that小子, not inferior to a Primordial Spirit!

“What exactly does he want to do?”

The spirit of the Great Wind Clan’s totem flickered.

As long as the totem statues exist, with sufficient power of the populace, they could be immortal. But if no one believed in them anymore, they would vanish.

The E’Shui Turtle had been on the verge of revival, but now that its totem statue is shattered, unless the National Teacher出手 (出手 - chūshǒu - takes action) to reshape it, it will likely never reappear in the world.

Similarly, if their totem statues were to take a strike from that小子...

“It is I.”

Han Zhen’s face was grim. Suddenly, he threw his head back and laughed, his blood energy churning:

“He, a mere Observation Realm cultivator, wants to enter a thousand armies...”

“To kill me!!?”

---

The manifestations of the calamitous beasts changed expressions.

If Han Zhen died.

Who would gather the Great Shang’s national fortune? Who would repair the Bronze Divine Tree?

Many of them had been awakened by Han Zhen.

Reflected in their eyes was that figure standing amidst the black tide, getting closer and closer, an indomitable war spirit that could not be extinguished.

“Bring back that小子’s head and offer it to the National Teacher as a drinking snack!”

The ferocious and terrifying figures vanished from the temple.

“Turtle God!”

The warriors of the Helian clan all had bloodshot eyes, swarming forward even more fearlessly.

And there were still the other three war golems...

Scorching high temperatures turned the armor on Li Mo’s body red. Streams of black Yin souls, formed from the power of the populace, constantly entangled him, only to be evaporated by his war intent and formation power, letting out piercing wails.

But he was ultimately slowed by the quagmire of the populace’s power. This kind of手段 (手段 - shǒuduàn - method/trick) was not something a martial artist should possess; he had never expected it.

He couldn’t possibly order the Greenwood Iron Cavalry charging with him to retreat now.

Cavalry charging into the fray could only stop through death or by shattering the enemy formation.

On the city wall.

“Rongyuan Army, prepare the siege crossbows! Open a path for the Commander and Young Hero Li!”

Wu Lang roared. His hand, bloody to the bone, pulled the bowstring, forcefully drawing it and loading the final siege crossbow.

“Fire!”

With the command, the killing weapons spat out sharp gusts of wind.

The gusts钻 (钻 - zuān - drilled) into the totem golems, exploding into bright sparks.

This attack did not destroy any of the golems, but it achieved its strategic objective: delaying the moment they fell.

And it was this brief moment.

Qu Sheng arrived.

The Greenwood Great Commander wore no armor, only a white robe. Yet he led his troop of cavalry at the very front. His spear swung with grand, open movements, shattering both men and armor in his vicinity.

By the time he charged to this point, the mixed formation of cavalry and infantry by his side had suffered heavy losses. Comrades fell every second.

However, he locked his gaze onto that war golem and fiercely kicked his horse’s belly.

The Snow-Treading White Dragon carried him, like a startled swan flashing past.

*Hum—*

A spear shadow swept across the sky, instantly passing the most agile Zhuyan golem and slashing fiercely at a weak point on its ankle.

*Wuu!!*

The Zhuyan golem let out a painful bronze groan. One of its legs was bent crooked, unable to support its terrifying weight any longer.

Another war golem fell, and the entire battlefield shuddered abruptly.

The next moment.

*Zheng—*

The zither music rang out once more. Li Mo’s Greenwood Iron Cavalry, each squad of a hundred men, instantly changed formations. Each squad seemed to transform into massive iron scales, forming a swimming dragon.

Li Mo had only taught the Black Scale Formation to Ying Bing not long ago.

She not only understood the Black Scale Formation but even innovated upon it?

The swimming dragon collided with the humanoid snake golem. Sparks erupted between the scales, and the friction sound was almost enough to make one’s teeth ache.

“Since you dare to charge my formation, then stay here!”

The Huodou golem seemed to be the most intelligent among them, actually speaking in human tongue.

It had stopped its steps earlier, seemingly gathering power for something?

Its bronze mouth opened.

The Huodou bronze statue, resembling a large dog, opened its巨 (巨 - jù - giant) mouth. Flames lit up in rings around the inscriptions on its body, finally converging in its mouth.

*Pfft—*

The moisture in the air was instantly vaporized. A swirling dragon of flame swept back towards them!
