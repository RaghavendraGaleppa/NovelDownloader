# Chapter 82: The Rankings Are Released, Ying Bing: “I’m Second?”

“Who am I? Where am I?”

It felt as though a long time had passed, yet it was also as if only an instant had gone by.

Outside the window, the cold moon still hung in the sky, illuminating the frozen stream.

Inside the guest room, Li Mo opened his eyes in a daze.

The magnificent and ancient scenes from before still lingered in his mind, refusing to fade, occupying nearly all of his consciousness.

Right now, only one emotion dominated his senses.

Hunger.

It wasn't a hunger of the stomach, but a thirst originating from the depths of his soul.

Subconsciously, he took out a bottle of Ten Thousand Year Old Earth Vein Spiritual Milk and gulped it down completely.

The Earth Vein Essence poured into his Dantian, continuously absorbed by his thirty-six main meridians, flowing into his Dantian and giving his body the feeling of long-drought meeting sweet rain.

“Haa...”

Little Li wiped the corner of his mouth and finally came to his senses, remembering what had just happened.

He had used the Heavenly Book Seal to deduce a martial art.

He had elevated a certain Divine Art to a higher grade, turning it into a lotus petal.

“That martial art... I wonder if it can even still be called a martial art.”

The feeling was very strange.

Li Mo clearly knew its contents, but he didn't know how to describe it.

He wanted to speak, but the words were already forgotten.

The ways he knew to convey information were far too pale and powerless to describe what the martial art depicted.

Then, he noticed something was off.

He quickly focused his attention on his Dantian.

He saw it.

A faint aura lingered within his Dantian, as substantial as if it were solid.

It was a light red color, like a flame that had burned since ancient times, eternal and undying.

Internal Qi!?

This time, his Internal Qi didn't disappear!

“Just one bottle of Ten Thousand Year Old Earth Vein Spiritual Milk only gave me a single strand?”

Li Mo was speechless.

He finally understood the purpose of those thirty-six meridians.

Without them working together to convert the Earth Vein Essence, he wouldn't have been able to condense even this single strand.

He raised a single finger.

That strand of Internal Qi immediately appeared at his fingertip.

It had no temperature, nor any specific scent.

He flicked his finger gently.

Immediately, the strand of Internal Qi flew out the window and landed on the frozen stream.

Miraculously, it began to burn just like that.

The ice was “ignited.”

And it didn't melt into water.

The firelight danced in Li Mo’s pupils, illuminating the surprise in his eyes.

“If I don’t take it back, it will keep burning like this.”

“Until the entire stream is burned away...”

“This Internal Qi isn't just capable of burning ice; it can even burn other ‘fires’...”

Realization dawned in his heart.

The Internal Qi of other martial artists definitely doesn't have such exaggerated characteristics.

At most, it would be a bit more resilient and have greater destructive power.

But his Internal Qi could burn all things, it was just a matter of time.

“So, how does this Internal Qi fit inside my body?”

Little Li found the loophole.

Well.

This probably can only be attributed to the wonders of the Xuanpin Immortal Body.

“Regardless, I have finally reached the Internal Qi Realm.”

Li Mo finally put down the heavy stone in his heart.

He currently still has twelve bottles of Earth Vein Spiritual Milk.

He set aside three of them: two for his parents and one for emergencies. He planned to use the remaining nine bottles entirely for cultivation.

Enough said, let the grinding begin!

...

Upstairs.

The room was filled with a snowy color; everywhere one looked was covered in frost.

The bed frame, made of high-quality wood, had been cracked by the cold.

Ying Bing’s beautiful brows slightly furrowed.

Faint fluctuations of Internal Qi spread out.

That's right, even at this time, she was still cultivating by borrowing the agitated Taiyin aura.

This required enduring immense pain, but it also yielded greater rewards.

Taiyin, the ultimate cold, the ultimate softness.

While it rustles all things, it also contains the vitality for all things to sprout.

---

This was also why her physical body far exceeded that of others in the same realm.

“The time should be... about right.”

Ying Bing raised her eyes, looking at the bright moon hanging in the sky.

It was midnight.

The System was very punctual and sent a prompt at this exact moment:

【Listing all genius names within the scope of the Eastern Wasteland Region...】

【Comparing combat power for the Host...】

The System was doing these two things simultaneously.

Actually, one only needed to look at the list.

As long as her name appeared at the top, everything else was self-evident.

“Haa...”

Ying Bing exhaled a breath carrying ice crystals, a hint of seriousness appearing on her jade-like face.

It wasn't because she was worried about her own position, but out of curiosity.

Besides Li Mo.

Would there be anyone else in this lifetime who would surprise her?

Where would that boy, who was so vastly different from his previous life, be ranked?

In the extreme cold where water instantly turned to ice, time seemed to lose its meaning.

【Ding—】

【The first ranking results are announced.】

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #50: Lin Jiang.】

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #49: Zhao Qin.】

...

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #30: Murong Xiao.】

...

Watching the lines of text appear on the System, Ying Bing’s expression returned to calm.

The System’s ranking did indeed have slight deviations from her memories.

For example, Lin Jiang, and for example, Murong Xiao.

By coincidence, it seemed both of these people knew Li Mo?

So far, she hadn't seen his name.

That was normal.

Li Mo’s swordsmanship was learned from her.

And when they sparred today, he even revealed some things she hadn't expected.

His ranking would at least be in the top twenty.

The System’s ranking text continued to appear.

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #20: Xiao Qin.】

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #19: Mei Ziguang.】

...

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #14: Luo Yu.】

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #13: Zuoqiu Yang.】

...

Gradually, within the System’s rankings.

Some names began to leave an impression on Ying Bing. Some had made a great name for themselves in the Eastern Wasteland Region in her previous life, while others later went to the Central Divine Continent, leaving their names amidst the storms of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths.

For instance, Luo Yu. After the decline of the Clear Cliff Sect, he led the Burning Jade Valley to become the leader of the Purple Sun Prefecture in one leap.

For instance, Zuoqiu Yang. He took first place in the Netherworld Trial and, years later, became a terrifying Heaven-rank assassin of the Drizzle Tower.

All were outstanding figures.

As for the top ten, they were even more like dragons and phoenixes among men.

Ying Bing’s thoughts moved slightly.

She realized that Li Mo wasn't among them either.

Had he entered the top ten?

No... not just the top ten.

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #5: Zhong Zhenyue.】

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #4: Han Zhen】

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #3: Shang Li.】

Seeing this, a hint of confusion and bewilderment finally flashed through Ying Bing’s eyes.

These few individuals were all people who would shine brightly in the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths in the future; heroes who stirred up their own waves amidst the rolling great trends.

For example, Shang Li, the former Crown Prince of the Great Shang Dynasty.

He possessed the last of the Great Shang Dynasty’s national fortune and later made a high-profile comeback to restore the nation.

For example, Han Zhen.

This person was quite mysterious. Ying Bing only knew that the speed of his rise was incredibly astonishing, and the martial arts he used seemed completely out of this era, suspected to be an inheritor of an ancient force.

Could Li Mo have surpassed them, being second only to her?

Just as this thought arose.

Ying Bing’s train of thought suddenly froze, her clear eyes trembling violently.

【Eastern Wasteland Region Genius Rank #2: Ying Bing.】

She saw herself.
