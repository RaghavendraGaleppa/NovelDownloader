# Chapter 114: All Seven Noble Lineages Defeated!

"Has this guy truly devoured the spirit of a flood dragon? How can his spiritual sense be so formidable?"

In just one encounter, the combined spiritual attack of the four was shattered. Not only that, but the silver flood dragon, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, counterattacked, causing all four to pale and stiffen.

Yet these four were no ordinary cultivators. Fighting together, their mana surged as various mystical seals illuminated the sky with dazzling colors. Just before the silver flood dragon struck, they barely managed to block it with their combined spiritual sense.

But the fact that it took all four of them to barely withstand the attack was unacceptable to their prideful hearts.

"Attack together! I refuse to believe one man can truly turn the heavens upside down!" Zhou Jun's eyes gleamed with golden light as he shouted sharply.

He was the top contender at the Flowing Clouds Banquet, the foremost genius of the seventh-grade spiritual roots. As a young man of great ambition, he couldn't tolerate anyone overshadowing him—how could he lose to Gu Yuan?!

"Whoosh!"

But before his words faded, a dense fog, so thick it seemed almost liquid, suddenly enveloped the surrounding area, trapping them all.

At the same time, a torrential downpour, like heavenly waters cascading down, violently washed away all traces within the mist that did not belong to Gu Yuan.

"The Mistwalking Seal?!" Zhou Jun's eyes narrowed as he immediately recognized the origin of the rain and fog.

Yet he was baffled—how could the Mistwalking Seal be so powerful?

The mist was as thick as clouds, the rain as fierce as a waterfall. Even with his strength, he couldn't see more than a few feet ahead. If this seal had always been this formidable, why had he ever bothered learning the Golden Radiance Sword Seal?!

"Slash!"

With the thick mist obscuring everything, Zhou Jun grew extremely wary. Without hesitation, he activated the Golden Radiance Sword Seal in his dantian, his mana surging as he unleashed his trump card.

The Golden Radiance Sword Seal!

He refused to believe that an ordinary secret seal could truly surpass the academy's supreme techniques!

"Clang!"

The sword light blazed brilliantly, like a golden thunderbolt cleaving through the void, slashing toward the mist.

He would cut through the fog to see the light!

"Boom!"

But the rain within the mist fell like a raging river, crashing down relentlessly. Every inch the sword light advanced, it was battered by countless raindrops.

Drops of water wear through stone. Though the sword light was dazzling, it only managed to pierce a few feet into the mist, tearing open a small gap before being completely suppressed.

And through that gap, Zhou Jun saw a sight that made his face turn ashen.

Gu Yuan, fingers pointed like a sword, wielded radiant peach blossom sword energy that gleamed brilliantly, shattering one protective seal after another on Su Huazheng's body. Under Su's horrified gaze, Gu severed his limbs, sliced off his hair, tore his robes, and with a single palm strike, sent him flying out of the mist to plummet into the river below.

Then, Gu Yuan slowly turned his head to look at Zhou Jun.

Those deep, unfathomable eyes held a chilling coldness.

At that gaze, a long-forgotten sense of panic inexplicably surged in Zhou Jun's heart.

"Boom!"

"Break!"

Meanwhile, from two other corners of the mist, explosions and furious shouts erupted as powerful spells forcibly tore through the fog, revealing two figures.

Zhuang Kangsheng of the Formless Peak and Mo Nanlian of the Moon Reflection Peak had also shattered a portion of the mist and witnessed the same scene as Zhou Jun.

Both were visibly shaken.

They had acted swiftly and fiercely, yet in such a short time, Su Huazheng had already been brutally eliminated?

How could a scion of a golden core lineage be so weak?

"Clang!"

This thought had barely formed in their minds when Gu Yuan was already upon them.

Pink peach blossoms, countless in number, accompanied by the mist and rain, slashed toward them.

The sword energy rang sharply, its killing intent so intense it seemed to freeze the rain and mist in the air.

Both were stunned.

This peach blossom sword energy wasn't as profound as the academy's Golden Radiance Sword Seal, but how could its sheer quantity and density be so terrifying?

In their eyes, thousands of sword beams surged forth like a storm of peach blossoms, the countless sword lights nearly blinding them.

"Dreamcloud Heavenly Pool!"

"Toad Moon's Cold Light!"

Their expressions changed drastically as mystical seals materialized before them.

Thick mist coalesced into a dense cloud pool. Ordinary spells would dissolve upon contact, dispersing into the air. This was the Formless Peak's signature seal, both offensive and defensive—unless the opponent's mana far surpassed theirs, breaking through was nearly impossible.

The Toad Moon's Cold Light was a secret seal of the Moon Reflection Peak, refined by gathering lunar essence. When unleashed, it could freeze spiritual patterns, immobilizing any seal.

Yet now, the peach blossoms from Gu Yuan's sleeves seemed endless, dyeing the entire Mistwalking Seal pink as they surged forward with the mist and rain.

"Clang!"

"Boom!"

Blossom after blossom, the sword energy forced its way through the cloud pool and shattered the cold light.

Both were horrified, a single thought flashing through their minds:

Is this what the jade slip meant by "transcendent mana"?

"Clang!"

But the dazzling sword light was already upon them, and none of their seals could stop it.

"No more holding back!"

Fear gripped Zhuang Kangsheng's heart as he roared. From his dantian emerged a white jade-like seal, shaped like a coiled dragon. It transformed into a cloud dragon, eerily lifelike, writhing through the air.

This cloud dragon seemed born of heavenly patterns. Though the sword energy was fierce, the dragon merely exhaled, and the sword light dissipated.

But in doing so, Zhuang Kangsheng's mana rapidly drained, his face turning deathly pale.

Still, Gu Yuan's relentless assault was finally halted.

Mo Nanlian's face lit up with joy as she began chanting.

Behind them, Zhou Jun struggled to break free from the mist, drawing closer to the battle.

Both felt a surge of hope.

"Boom!"

But Gu Yuan merely took a single step, crossing the void with sheer physical strength to appear before them.

"Whoosh!"

The cloud dragon exhaled, as if to melt Gu Yuan, but he simply waved his hand. An overwhelming force shook the void, and an eerie chill emanated from his fist, freezing the dragon solid before he shattered it with a punch.

"Crack!"

"Crack!"

Before Zhuang Kangsheng and Mo Nanlian could react, searing pain shot through their limbs, and a crushing blow struck their abdomens.

Then, the world spun as they plummeted uncontrollably into the river below.

"Brothers and sisters, fear not! Zhou Jun is here!"

At that moment, Zhou Jun finally broke free from the mist and arrived at the battlefield.

But to his disbelief, only Gu Yuan remained.

"Whoosh!"

Gu Yuan merely gave him a cold glance before a crimson arrow, like a shooting star, shot toward him from the depths of the mist.

"He still had the energy to form a Secret Arrow after fighting four of us?!"

This was Zhou Jun's last thought before a tremendous force struck his shoulder, tearing through his body and severing his meridians.

Then, he too fell from the sky, plunging into the river.

The mist dissipated, leaving only Gu Yuan standing alone above the vast river.

The so-called seven noble lineages, the so-called prodigies—all were gone.

And all this had taken barely a dozen breaths since the battle began.

Bian Chuyao and the others were still locked in their own struggle.

When Gu Yuan appeared on the clouds, hands behind his back, calm and composed, their expressions changed instantly.

"How is this possible?!"

Si Rujing and Xiao Yi shrieked in disbelief.

Bian Chuyao and Feng Anping were equally stunned, their faces filled with shock.

"I told you—ten spots were too many…"

Gu Yuan sighed softly as he turned his gaze to the remaining two.

Without hesitation, they abandoned their opponents and fled.

But it was futile.
