# Chapter 79: Second-Tier Talisman Master

Not only were people from Green Stream Sect noticing Chu Ning's business. As the foot traffic gradually increased at Chu Ning's shop, people began inquiring about the acquisition and sale of spirit plants, in addition to purchasing talismans. Chu Ning found himself subtly becoming the busiest among his peers, handling two businesses at once. Spirit plants and talismans were, after all, the most commonly used items by low-tier cultivators, so it was normal for there to be many customers.

Across the street, in a shop bearing the sign of Fengxia Valley Talisman Workshop, a young attendant rushed in and addressed a yellow-robed cultivator in his thirties. "Boss, what they're saying outside is true. Green Stream Talisman Workshop really does have a new person. He looks young, around sixteen or seventeen, and I heard some people say he's at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation. And he actually put up a 'buy five, get one free' sign for the opening day."

The yellow-robed cultivator glanced at the attendant. "That's not what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned about what they say outside: that the talismans he produces are even better than ours. Is that true?"

The attendant didn't answer directly. Instead, he pulled a talisman from his robes. "I don't understand this myself, but I bought one to bring back for you, Boss."

The yellow-robed cultivator reached out and took the talisman. After merely sensing it for a moment, his expression immediately changed. "How can this be? The quality of this talisman is so high, even I, a second-tier talisman master, cannot produce such a talisman! Do you think those from Fengxia Valley just sit around idly? We have a second-tier talisman master here!" He looked up at the attendant. "Is that person really just sixteen or seventeen, and only at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation?"

The attendant nodded, then hesitated. "Indeed, there's only one person. I heard he's a disciple from both the Spirit Talisman Pavilion and the Spirit Plant House of Green Stream Sect, managing two shops. As for whether he's at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation, I can't tell."

The yellow-robed cultivator concluded, "It must be that he brought them from his sect. Even if he has them, there won't be many." As for Chu Ning being able to produce intermediate-grade talismans, the yellow-robed cultivator hadn't even considered the possibility. "I refuse to believe that he could bring so many intermediate-grade talismans out from his sect." He continued, "I was originally thinking of selling these intermediate-grade talismans sporadically to drive up prices. But now, it seems I must bring out more."

Then, the yellow-robed cultivator instructed his attendant, "Go hang a sign at the entrance. This workshop will have a large quantity of intermediate-grade offensive talismans and a small quantity of intermediate-grade defensive talismans for sale on the next market day." After giving the instruction, the yellow-robed cultivator walked out directly. "You stay here, I'm going to take a look."

About half an incense stick later, the yellow-robed cultivator returned, his face full of bewilderment. Chu Ning's talismans had actually surpassed Fengxia Valley's workshop in reputation, which no one had anticipated. With Chu Ning's "buy five, get one free" gimmick, it was only natural for his business to flourish. Many people were saying that Fengxia Valley was preparing to bring out a large quantity of intermediate-grade talismans for sale.

Meanwhile, at Chu Ning's shop, a forty-something male cultivator, dressed in coarse cloth and with a square face, approached. He looked like a spirit farmer from a cultivation family, carrying two bags of spirit rice, asking if Chu Ning would buy them back.

"Shopkeeper, can the price be a bit higher? How about sixty catties for one spirit stone?" the spirit farmer asked.

Chu Ning, ever the businessman, also noted that the spirit farmer seemed to be having a difficult time. "Your spirit rice is only of medium quality. I can't sell it for a high price here. I can't just work for nothing." He continued, "Here, one hundred catties of spirit rice for one spirit stone plus three liang of fragmented spirit stones..." Chu Ning shook his head slightly. "This fellow cultivator, it's my first day opening, and I haven't prepared any fragmented spirit stones here at the moment." Chu Ning indeed hadn't prepared any small denominations of spirit stones. Ever since he started making talisman paper, all his transactions were in whole spirit stones; he simply didn't carry fragmented ones.

The spirit farmer sighed softly and finally placed the two bags of spirit rice in front of Chu Ning. "Can I ask you, shopkeeper, if you could help me catalyze some seeds with those three liang of fragmented spirit stones?"

Chu Ning heard this and thought it was feasible, so he said, "Take them out and let me see. What kind of seeds are they?"

The spirit farmer, hearing this, pulled out a cloth bag from his robes and opened it, revealing a handful of slightly purplish-black seeds. Chu Ning was slightly surprised. "Fellow Daoist, are you planning to plant these Green Spirit Fruit seeds? These are not very easy to grow, you know."

The market's peak hours passed, and as closing time approached, the crowd gradually thinned. Chu Ning looked up and saw Luo Yiping from the Spirit Beast House, Gu Xiaoqing from the Alchemy Hall, and Shen Zhengquan from the Artifact Forging Hall, all tidying up and preparing to close. Although everyone had good business on their first day, Chu Ning's shop undoubtedly had the highest popularity.

Gu Xiaoqing, whose alchemy products were the easiest to pack up, was already done. Seeing Chu Ning look her way, she smiled from afar and called out, "Junior Brother Chu, your talisman workshop has had quite a good day's business!"

"Hmph, don't get too carried away," Luo Yiping interjected coldly from the side. Luo Yiping's voice was full of mockery. Luo Yiping had previously always targeted Chu Ning under the guise of bringing honor to the sect, but from the first day, Chu Ning was ironically the one who brought the most face to Green Stream Sect. Luo Yiping seemed to have noticed the dissatisfaction of the other two (Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan) and said no more, but his gaze towards Chu Ning still held a hint of schadenfreude.

Gu Xiaoqing's words immediately caused Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan to pause slightly. Shen Zhengquan couldn't bear to listen anymore and gave a light cough. Gu Xiaoqing's face showed a hint of displeasure, and her delicate brows furrowed slightly. Regardless, Chu Ning was, after all, from the same sect.

Chu Ning, seeing this, felt a slight annoyance in his heart. However, directly refuting Luo Yiping was not his style. Chu Ning habitually kept a low profile, humbly stating, "I merely have the advantage of running two businesses simultaneously. If you consider single businesses, I'm not doing better than Senior Sister Gu."

Chu Ning hadn't noticed that the Fengxia Valley cultivator had come to observe him from a distance earlier. The cultivation world was cruel; he had a clear understanding of this himself.
