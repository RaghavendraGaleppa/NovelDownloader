# Chapter 17: Longevity, Celestial Palace, and the Dragon!

"Fourth level of Qi Refinement? Take this token. You may only browse the Classics and Snow sections or the first floor of the Transmission Hall. All other areas are off-limits!"

Beneath the towering, immeasurably vast hall, a middle-aged Daoist with graying hair and a weathered face—clearly at the seventh level of Qi Refinement—glared coldly at the exceptionally handsome young man before him. After pocketing a spirit stone from the table, he tossed out a token and gestured impatiently for the youth to enter.

Though his appearance hadn't yet fully succumbed to age, the signs of decline were unmistakable. With no hope of reaching Foundation Establishment, he was relegated to menial tasks in the Scripture Pavilion. Every time he encountered these vibrant new disciples, an inexplicable melancholy gnawed at him.

Time was like a galloping steed—the strong rode it with ease, soaring freely between heaven and earth, while the mediocre were slowly crushed beneath its hooves.

"Thank you, Senior Brother."

Gu Yuan paid no mind to the Daoist's indifference. Calmly accepting the token, he stepped into the Scripture Pavilion.

Three days had passed since he settled into his cave abode. During that time, he had focused on cultivating while monitoring the jade pillar's condensation of spiritual water. Now that enough time had elapsed to avoid drawing attention, he finally entered the pavilion to study its texts.

He had already discerned the jade pillar's capabilities, but the nature of the second type of spiritual water it produced eluded him. Thus, he needed to consult the pavilion's records.

Holding the token, he passed through an invisible azure barrier and stepped inside.

Before him stretched towering bookshelves, arranged like a massive pyramid at the center of the grand hall. Countless bamboo scrolls, jade tomes, and spirit slips were meticulously organized. Like ants, disciples scurried across the shelves, engrossed in the vast array of texts.

Beneath the shelves, a colossal luminous screen categorized the books in detail. A mere touch would reveal the approximate location of any desired text.

Rumors said that the Qingfeng Dao Academy's Scripture Pavilion once housed a special "Book Spirit" that managed all texts. One needed only voice their thoughts, and the spirit would retrieve the relevant materials. However, the Book Spirit, privy to too many secrets, had eventually been sealed away, forcing the academy to rely on cruder methods to manage the sea of knowledge.

Gu Yuan lingered by the screen for a long while, pinpointing the general location of the texts he sought. With a wave of his hand, a paper-thin, wing-like artifact materialized beneath his feet, lifting him toward the shelves.

The Scripture Pavilion was vast and imposing, yet flight was forbidden within. Only the pavilion's unique "Book Boats" could carry visitors aloft, allowing them to navigate freely.

"Four Millennia of Star Spirits!"

"Chronicles of the Southern Mountain Domain!"

"Observations of the Four Domains!"

"Journey Through the Central Divine Continent!"

Rather than immediately searching for records on spiritual water, Gu Yuan first sought out miscellaneous accounts and descriptions of this world. Understanding the broader context before investigating the jade pillar and its water would draw less attention.

After skimming several texts, he found that while they all touched upon the Southern Mountain Domain and the wider world, none provided a truly comprehensive overview. Then, a heavy, ancient tome caught his eye.

"Seal of Longevity!"

The bold, majestic strokes of the title instantly captivated him. Without hesitation, he picked it up.

"Never say longevity is hard to attain!"

"Never say longevity lies beyond reach!"

"Heaven and earth bear a seal—the Seal of Longevity!"

The opening lines carried an indescribable grandeur that stirred the soul. After just a glance, Gu Yuan was lost in its pages.

A long while later, Gu Yuan finally resurfaced from his reading. Staring at the now-finished stone tome in his hands, his eyes gleamed with an inscrutable light.

"Longevity... Longevity!"

"Could such a divine artifact truly exist in this world?!"

Exhaling deeply, his expression was one of utter disbelief.

According to the text, this world harbored a divine seal—the Seal of Longevity—born of the heavens and earth at an unknown time. To possess it was to attain immortality, to stand equal with the cosmos, untouched by the passage of time.

For countless millennia, the mightiest cultivators and demonic beings had waged endless wars over this seal. Battles raged across the nine heavens and ten earths, toppling the most glorious dynasties and annihilating entire domains. In the end, only two remained.

One was a great demon of the Flood Dragon Clan.

The other was the most fearsome existence among humankind.

Both employed every conceivable method, yet neither could claim the complete Seal of Longevity. Instead, each obtained half.

But even half a seal wielded unimaginable power.

Thus, the True Dragon was born—the only one of its kind in the world.

Across the boundless Four Seas, countless aquatic demons and cultivators bowed to a single voice.

The Dragon Palace arose, ruling all waters under heaven.

And above the four great land domains, a Celestial Palace took form.

A True Immortal reigned there, akin to an Emperor of Heaven.

The laws of the Celestial Palace commanded the earth, and none dared disobey.

For cultivators, there was no path to surpass the True Immortal and the True Dragon.

---

These two colossal powers cast their shadows over land and sea. Their decrees were absolute; defiance invited instant annihilation.

"Dragons" and "True Immortals" became synonymous with taboo.

Yet this was also the darkest of ages.

The shadows of the Celestial Palace and the Dragon stretched across the world. Every cultivator who reached the pinnacle of power either hid in fear or submitted to one of the two factions.

But even that was futile.

Time was a merciless blade.

Only the True Dragon and the True Immortal could withstand its edge.

Generations of prodigies were ground to dust by the passage of years. Tens of millennia later, the two monoliths remained unshaken.

It was despair made manifest.

Yet... the Seal of Longevity was incomplete.

A complete seal would grant eternal life, making one coeval with heaven and earth.

But half a seal, while bestowing immense power, could not bestow endless years.

"The laws of the Celestial Palace no longer seem to extend beyond the Central Divine Continent..."

"Of the Four Seas, only the Eastern Sea has heard the True Dragon's voice in nearly ten millennia..."

The final lines of the stone tome stopped short of outright blasphemy, offering only vague conjecture.

"The Seal of Longevity has its own mysteries. Should calamity befall its bearers, it will return to heaven and earth..."

In other words, if these two were to perish, the seal would become ownerless.

And anyone could seize it!

"The Seal of Longevity?"

"Could such a divine artifact truly exist?"

Gu Yuan couldn't help but question the accounts in the tome. The tale was so fantastical it strained belief.

Yet, recalling his recent experiences, he could keenly sense the oppressive weight the "Celestial Palace" and the "Dragon" exerted over the world's cultivators.

And the burgeoning desire in the hearts of all who knew the truth.

No one dared speak of "death," yet it seemed everyone was waiting.

Even if they couldn't claim the Seal of Longevity, the world would inevitably undergo an unprecedented upheaval.

His heart surging with emotion, Gu Yuan turned back to the first page and read once more:

"Never say longevity is hard to attain!"

"Never say longevity lies beyond reach!"
