# Chapter 60: Bloody Conclusion, Fire Avatar, and Scarlet Essence Mushroom! (3/3)

Outside the Bloody Battleground, the six sect patriarchs waited anxiously, with Li Huayuan of the Yellow Maple Valley being the most restless. He paced back and forth on a rock, muttering, "Why hasn't anyone come out yet?"

Meanwhile, the five Golden Core cultivators from the Spirit Beast Mountain, Great Sword Sect, Saber Transformation Valley, Clear Void Sect, and Sky Fortress wore equally grim expressions.

The first to emerge from the Bloody Battleground was none other than Nangong Wan.

"A Foundation Establishment cultivator?!" Li Huayuan was stunned. "How is this possible? There were no Foundation Establishment cultivators when we entered!"

The Golden Core elders from the other five sects immediately turned their attention toward the Moon Veil Sect's direction, sending urgent messages to Fairy Nichang, demanding an explanation. However, all their inquiries went unanswered.

Just as the five were about to voice their grievances, they noticed Old Monster Qiong silently appearing at the bow of the Heavenly Moon Divine Ship, flashing them a knowing smile.

"Bastards—"

"Those Moon Veil Sect scoundrels!"

The realization dawned upon them—they had been played by the Moon Veil Sect and Old Monster Qiong. The Moon Veil Sect had lured them into hunting Lin Yun, but given the vastness of the Bloody Battleground, tracking down a single individual was no easy feat. Even if they succeeded, the casualties would be devastating. And now, with a Foundation Establishment cultivator emerging from their ranks, who could possibly stand against her? Moreover, the Moon Veil Sect had blatantly violated the seven sects' agreement!

The next to emerge was a middle-aged Daoist priest from the Clear Void Sect. His robes were covered in dust, with several large tears and bloodstains, evidence of the fierce battles he had endured. After bowing respectfully to his sect's Golden Core elder, he quietly sat down to meditate.

This man was fortunate—he hadn't encountered Lin Yun.

Gradually, more survivors trickled out: the effeminate man from Saber Transformation Valley, the ugly brute Zhong Wu from Spirit Beast Mountain, and the barefoot swordsman from the Great Sword Sect.

This time, the Yellow Maple Valley didn't have the most survivors. Due to being targeted by the other six sects, despite Lin Yun's efforts to save some, more than half had perished. However, compared to previous years' bloodbaths, the survival rate was slightly higher.

The sects with the most survivors were Spirit Beast Mountain and the Clear Void Sect. Having allied with the other sects, they avoided much of the slaughter. Moreover, since they possessed nothing Lin Yun desired, they were largely left alone—save for a few unlucky souls who crossed his path.

Despite having more surviving disciples, Floating Cloud Master of the Clear Void Sect wore no smile. He knew the outcome of the wager no longer depended on the disciples—it all hinged on one man.

Next came Sky Fortress and Saber Transformation Valley. Although Sky Fortress had lost some members to Lin Yun's hunt, they were relatively fortunate. After Lin Yun encountered the barefoot swordsman—whom he spared—the remaining members managed to survive the subsequent battles for spirit herbs.

As for Saber Transformation Valley, their low numbers weren't due to Lin Yun's interference but rather their own lack of strength.

With only an hour left before the passage closed, the Moon Veil Sect had yet to produce any survivors besides Nangong Wan. Old Monster Qiong and Fairy Nichang exchanged uneasy glances.

Meanwhile, inside the Bloody Battleground...

"Han Li, come here." Lin Yun called out to Han Li just as they were about to leave.

"Brother Lin, is there something else?" Han Li asked.

"Here, take this." Lin Yun tossed the remains of the Black Flood Dragon to Han Li, not bothering to process the materials himself.

"Isn't this the second-grade Black Flood Dragon?!" Han Li exclaimed. "Brother Lin, these materials are valuable. You don't want them?"

"I have no use for them," Lin Yun shook his head. "Ordinary top-grade magic tools no longer interest me. What I need are supreme-grade magic tools, which require third or fourth-grade monster materials."

Han Li nodded in understanding. Indeed, common items were beneath Lin Yun's notice now. "In that case, I won't stand on ceremony. Thank you, Brother Lin."

Han Li accepted the gift without further hesitation. Since the small green vial's secret was already exposed, he could simply repay Lin Yun by accelerating the growth of spirit herbs for him later.

[Ding! Host has gifted friend Han Li "Second-Grade Black Flood Dragon Corpse," triggering "Cast a bread upon the waters."]

[Ding! Congratulations, host has obtained a seventh-grade water-attribute monster—Infant Carp Beast's Demon Core and Spirit.]

[Treasure Description: The Infant Carp Beast is a natural water-attribute spirit beast with formidable water-based abilities, capable of unleashing Water Prison Divine Thunder. Its materials can be used to craft water-attribute magic treasures. Pills refined from its seventh-grade demon core can aid Nascent Soul cultivators.]

"Trading a second-grade for a seventh-grade—what a steal," Lin Yun mused with satisfaction.

"Han Li, how many spirit herbs do you have on you?" Lin Yun then asked.

Han Li gave a wry smile. "I was unconscious for two days in the stone hall and barely gathered any. I only have a few."

"Don't worry about Foundation Establishment Pills, though. I collected some immature herbs and can use the small green vial to accelerate their growth." As he mentioned the vial, Han Li cautiously glanced at Lin Yun, relieved to see his expression remain unchanged.

Lin Yun shook his head. "Here's what we'll do—I'll give you some of mine so you can make up thirty herbs."

"Huh? Why?" Han Li looked puzzled.

"You might not know this, but Li Huayuan, the Golden Core elder leading our Yellow Maple Valley team, is notoriously stingy and loves taking advantage of others."

"There's an unwritten rule in Yellow Maple Valley: when a master-disciple relationship is established, the master has the right to claim half of the disciple's tribute to the sect as a 'thanksgiving gift'—but only once."

"Now, he wouldn't dare take me as a disciple. But you—if you bring out thirty herbs, he'll definitely covet your share and take you under his wing."

"Our footing in Yellow Maple Valley is too weak. Becoming a Golden Core elder's disciple will give you more freedom, and no one will question your rapid progress anymore."

Han Li's eyes widened. "There's such a rule in Yellow Maple Valley?"

Lin Yun nodded and handed Han Li enough herbs to make up thirty. He had plenty to spare—all looted from others—and hadn't even bothered counting. He had also stashed one of each rare herb in his system storage, ready for Han Li to cultivate later if needed.

"Thank you, Brother Lin." Han Li accepted without hesitation. The chance to become a Golden Core elder's disciple was too good to pass up. Besides, this would allow him to better assist Lin Yun in the future.

[Ding! Host has gifted friend Han Li "Spirit Herbs—Purple Monkey Flower and Jade Marrow Mushroom," triggering "Cast a bread upon the waters."]

[Ding! Congratulations, host has obtained a three-thousand-year spirit herb—Scarlet Essence Mushroom.]

[Treasure Description: Grows only in molten lava, rich in fire-attribute spiritual energy. Greatly aids the advancement of fire-attribute cultivation techniques.]

In Lin Yun's inventory appeared a fiery-red, translucent mushroom, no more than a few inches tall. Wisps of crimson mist swirled around it like celestial clouds, giving it an ethereal, immortal aura.

"Perfect timing!" Lin Yun's spirits lifted.

He was about to break through to Foundation Establishment, which meant he could begin cultivating avatars as described in the Profound Heaven Five Spirits Art. With his Three Yangs Constitution and the fire-attribute Heavenly Spiritual Root acquired from Nangong Wan, the fire avatar was the obvious and easiest choice to start with.

Though his innate advantages would suffice for the fire avatar's initial stages, the Scarlet Essence Mushroom provided an extra safety net. Moreover, when the time came to advance his five avatars to greater heights, this herb would be invaluable.

And if he ever ran short, he could always have Han Li cultivate more—an endless supply to fuel his fire avatar's growth!

With the gifts given and rewards secured, Lin Yun and Han Li finally stepped out of the Bloody Battleground.

The moment Lin Yun appeared, every gaze on the scene snapped toward him.
