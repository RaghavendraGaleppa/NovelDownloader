# Chapter 211: Imperial Road Collision

Qin Ming slapped out, and with a crisp crack, Li Qingxu’s face split open.

“So sturdy?” He was surprised. It was just a statue, what material was it made of? How could it withstand a palm strike from him?

He didn't stop. Since one slap wasn't enough to shatter it, he added another. This time, he added more force, unleashing the Dragon-Serpent Scripture. Immediately, crackling sounds emanated, Li Qingxu’s face shattered, and then his entire head exploded.

Qin Ming naturally found Li Qingxu a thorn in his side. In the past, before he had embarked on the Path of Rebirth, his arm had been broken by this very person, and three parts of his skull had been crushed, leading him through a near-death tribulation. He had been unconscious for at least two months, almost never waking up. Regardless, the enmity between him and Li Qingxu was irreconcilable.

In a place of misty clouds, within a palace of golden bricks and jade tiles, Li Qingxu was meditating with his eyes closed, comprehending the Dao. The meditation mat he sat upon flowed with purple mist, enveloping him. On the table before him, an incense stick had been lit, exuding a subtle Dao韵 that rendered one's mind exceptionally clear.

In Li Qingxu's mind, a supreme teaching he had long memorized was being unveiled, its core tenets clearly emerging from the mist. He grasped its true meaning, gradually comprehending it thoroughly. At this moment, immortal qi surged, and dense runes appeared on his body, as if imprinting themselves into his flesh and spiritual consciousness.

Suddenly, with a boom, his path violently shook, almost throwing him off the special meditation mat. Li Qingxu abruptly opened his eyes, his face filled with bewilderment. At such a crucial moment, how could there be an external disturbance? Just now, all his essence, qi, and spirit were invested in that page of true transmission, using this place of Dao comprehension to earnestly grasp its profound meaning. Yet, he was suddenly awakened. This infuriated him; nothing could be worse.

“What’s going on?” He shot to his feet.

“Creatures from other paths are attacking the ‘traces’ you left behind,” a mechanical, cold voice echoed in the palace.

“What impact does that have on me?” Li Qingxu asked.

“When he shatters your statue in that plaza, he can then challenge you to a confrontation between different paths!”

Upon hearing this, Li Qingxu’s feather robe fluttered, and his hair lifted. He originally possessed an almost immortal aura, but now his gaze was incredibly cold.

“How do I strike back now?” he said chillingly. When had he ever suffered such a loss? His senior brothers and sisters were all over a hundred years old and were powerful cultivators. He usually feared no one because of them. Anyone daring to target him like this would naturally face a fierce retaliation. Most importantly, he was Cao Qianqiu’s youngest disciple, and their lineage had always been in a dominant position.

The cold voice informed him, “He has only recently embarked on his path, reaching only the first node, the plaza. He has not yet left any traces there, so he cannot project back to you. You can only wait for now.”

Li Qingxu’s face darkened. Was he to be passively beaten? He could only sit here and wait for someone to challenge him. Normally, he would directly attack and seize the initiative.

“Who is he?” he asked again.

The cold voice replied, “He will be named after he condenses his traces in the plaza and his statue is erected. Currently, we only know that he is on the Demon Path.”

Li Qingxu’s expression was cold. “The plateau outside the Third Absolute Land is about to be bathed in blood, and a young demon dares to embark on a path and sneak into the secret realm? What audacity. I’ll settle accounts with him later; I doubt he’ll make it out of the secret realm.”

He waited for a moment and found that the entire path had become quiet, no longer under attack. He couldn't afford to waste time like this; the lit incense stick was extremely precious. He didn't want to waste it and sat down again. The meditation mat beneath him was also an extraordinary item, equally helpful for comprehending the Dao. These were temporary boons from this place after he embarked on the mysterious immortal path.

Qin Ming was looking at other statues, finding those of Li Qingyue, the Abandoned Buddha, Su Shiyun, and others, all of whom were Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds. Little Wu was also among them.

“Hm, among everyone, you’re still the one I despise the most. Disappear completely!”

Qin Ming turned back, soaring into the air and delivering a kick – it was the Tail Whip stance from the Dragon-Serpent Scripture! With a crack, the upper half of the entire statue exploded this time. Then, he delivered a second kick, and Li Qingxu's remnant statue utterly disintegrated. Instantly, Qin Ming felt much better.

Far away, Li Qingxu’s path violently vibrated twice. He was disturbed again, his face frosty, withdrawing from his state of Dao comprehension.

At this moment, Qin Ming suddenly saw his own blurry figure appear, and a voice asked for his name. “My statue is erected here too, what is this for?” A moment later, he roughly understood.

“Demon Path Cultivator One officially challenges Immortal Path Li Qingxu!” the cold voice announced.

“Finally!” Li Qingxu rose, his face ashen. Then, he saw a statue materialize in his palace. He was certain he had never seen this wild-looking demon before. He made no attempt to hide his disgust for this challenger, wishing he could smash him with a single blow.

This time, it was Qin Ming’s turn to frown. So these statues had another ‘marvelous purpose’: different paths could engage in confrontations this way. Before him, Li Qingxu’s statue reappeared in the plaza, completely restored.

“Is it not a direct fight?” Qin Ming asked.

The mechanical voice informed him, “Not so. Instead, it is the materialized ‘achievements’ from your respective paths colliding!”

“Boring!” Li Qingxu muttered, somewhat displeased. He really wanted to directly confront that demon. From what he knew, the demon seeds on the plateau were nothing special.

“Challenge begins, you may now act,” the cold voice announced.

In an instant, Li Qingxu found that the manifested statue before him seemed to have come to life. He immediately swung his shimmering purple bamboo staff, striking forward. Runes covered his body, his flesh, and his spiritual consciousness. He was using a profound teaching he had just been comprehending. For a moment, his fleshly strength and spiritual consciousness resonated, making his purple bamboo staff almost transparent, carrying his terrifying power.

Qin Ming observed that the Li Qingxu in the plaza seemed to have truly come back to life, appearing before him and swinging a weapon at him. At this moment, he didn't hesitate. Facing a true near-immortal seed of the Second Realm, he dared not be careless in the slightest, naturally giving his all. In fact, he felt he had acted rashly this time, starting a battle with Li Qingxu too early, as his own cultivation realm wasn't high enough yet. The silver-robed youth and spider-scorpion he had killed in the secret realm only possessed fragmented demon seeds, not complete ones.

Boom!

On his path, a large amount of red demonic mist surged as he struck, violently churning. For a moment, the unified Celestial Radiance Force was like a scorching sun crossing the sky, stained with blood, blasting forward.

“Hm?”

“This is…”

Both felt deeply surprised, realizing they had underestimated their opponent's strength! Qin Ming had initially thought he might face unimaginable pressure. But at this moment, a look of bewilderment crossed his face. Was this really a near-immortal seed of the Second Realm? He had actually blocked it with one punch, it seemed somewhat unworthy of its reputation! At the very least, the opponent's bamboo staff was repelled by his fist light, utterly lacking in lethality.

“How is this possible? How could a demon be so strong?!” Li Qingxu's heart trembled because he saw that when the statue erupted, it delivered a punch that was like a blood-stained scorching sun hanging before him. At this moment, his spiritual consciousness felt a searing pain. His right hand, gripping the staff, was numb from the shock, and he was actually retreating.

The cold voice rang out, “This is the result of your materialized achievements on your respective paths, converted to collide within the same realm.”

For a moment, Li Qingxu was lost in thought. In a confrontation within the same realm, he was actually inferior to that demon! He didn't know the other party's specific cultivation realm, but he assumed it was also in the Second Realm.

“Oh, so that’s how it is, then it gets interesting!” Qin Ming said, a smile spreading across his face.

“A serious reminder: you can engage in 'Path-Wielding Confrontation', but you need not make physical contact with each other!” the mechanical voice announced, informing them that this was a protection for those with aspirations to forge their own paths.

In the secret realm, many people suddenly looked up because two paths inexplicably appeared in the void, stretching across the sky, visible to everyone. They actually surged towards each other, like two mountains colliding, clashing once. One path steamed with demonic qi, the other suffused with immortal mist, both fluctuating. Was this a clash between a demon seed and an immortal seed, a battle unfolding? Everyone was greatly astonished.

At this moment, one path billowed with red demonic mist, with dragon roars echoing along it, while the other surged with immortal qi, with some pure Yang spiritual consciousness ascending. Everyone saw the two paths collide again. A heart-palpitating aura erupted from that place, as if two mountain ranges were about to fall. The Demon Path clearly gained the upper hand, suppressing the Immortal Path below. The latter violently shook incessantly, making people wonder if it would break apart.

“Could it be… that person acting?” Gan Jincheng’s voice trembled.

“He… couldn’t have embarked on the demon path to conceal his true identity, could he?” Jiang Ruoli was also somewhat dazed, staring blankly at the sky. At this time, Xiao Yaqin, Liu Hanying, and others had similar thoughts, for they all knew that Qin Ming had obtained several fragmented demon seeds.

Xin Youdao was extremely serious. “Don’t forget, we all swore an oath with a forbidden technique. That person, no matter what, cannot be him.”

“Yes, even if it truly is… uh, it’s not him!”

“Exactly, it’s not him at all!”

Although they all said this, their eyes burned with intense light, fixed on the two paths in the sky, their expressions unsettled. They naturally understood the gravity of the situation; some words could not be casually uttered. The other party had saved their lives, and even without the forbidden technique, they would not bring up this matter again.

“That’s Li Qingxu’s path; he’s being attacked. I really didn’t expect there to be such an incredibly powerful demon in the secret realm!” The disciples from the Outer Pure Land also looked up at the sky, completely stunned.

“Li Qingxu might be struck down!” someone said, bringing up old matters again, their words surprisingly excited.

Someone immediately retorted, “Shut up! Senior Brother Li will not be defeated. He is Senior Cao’s direct disciple and has the ambition to forge his own path. He can become near-immortal in the future!” People were very wary of Cao Qianqiu’s lineage and naturally did not want to be caught at fault or be held accountable. Thus, many people stopped speaking, quietly watching.
