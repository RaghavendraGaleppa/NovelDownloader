# Chapter 9: Becoming a Guard and Defeating Bi Hao

"I have no way to retreat now. If I am to die, I will die on the擂台!" Li Xian said hoarsely.

Bi Hao's expression turned ugly. How dare this lowly slave block his path? He said, "Good, good, good! You are seeking death yourself."

Pang Long raised his eyebrows slightly, a hint of admiration rising in his heart. "Let the match begin quickly. The incense is almost burned out. The one still standing on the擂台 at the end will be the victor."

His words undoubtedly added fuel to the fire. Bi Hao clenched his fists, victory within reach, and his heart was difficult to calm. He only wished to quickly send Li Xian flying, stand alone on the stage, and become a guard from this day forward. He took a deep breath, rushed forward, and threw a punch head-on.

Li Xian crossed his arms to block his head.

*Thump!* The punch landed on his forearm, turning it purple in an instant.

This was a move from the Three Talents Fist Technique, the [Earth Stance Fist]. It aimed for simplicity and stability, seeking progress without any outstanding advantages or flaws.

The Three Talents Fist... was a widely circulated basic fist technique, consisting of Heaven, Earth, and Man.

A few days ago.

Bi Hao had consumed the "Essence Treasure Soup," and the qi and strength in his body had become continuous and unending. That very day, he had achieved a breakthrough in the Three Talents Fist Technique, advancing to the second level.

The Earth Stance Fist was simple in its punches, but it carried a sense of solidity. Dealing with a mere laborer who didn't know any martial arts, it was almost a guaranteed victory.

After several punches, Li Xian's arms were in extreme pain. He endured it all with sheer willpower, holding on tightly.

Although he had never learned the "Three Talents Fist Technique," he had just watched Bi Hao's fist techniques from below the擂台. In the previous matches, Bi Hao had been arrogant and wanted to show off to win Pang Long's appreciation. He had intentionally displayed his martial arts attainments, revealing the patterns and moves of his punches, which Li Xian secretly memorized.

"It's almost time..."

Li Xian endured for a moment longer when he suddenly noticed Bi Hao's movements becoming wider. A joy sparked in his heart; the moment he had been waiting for had arrived.

In that instant, he let out a low roar.

All the anger in his chest surged out.

The first move of the Bull Strength Fist, [Raging Bull Charge], was unleashed instantly. The punch flowed smoothly, having been accumulating power for a long time. The moment the punch was thrown, it was as if a raging bull was charging forward, its sharp horns ramming into the target!

"Ah!" Bi Hao was startled and hastily switched from offense to defense.

This punch didn't defeat Bi Hao, but it completely disrupted his footing.

Li Xian silently recited in his heart: "Green Bull Flicks Its Tail!"

He spun and threw a punch, using the twisting force of his waist and abdomen to increase the power of the move. Though it was a fist technique, it was as nimble as a whip. The thousands of swings in the past were all for this very moment. A warm current from his Dantian flowed into his fist, its momentum incredibly heavy!

*Bang!*

This punch landed on Bi Hao's shoulder, almost shattering it. A faint sound of bone cracking was heard.

But it wasn't Bi Hao's bone; it was Li Xian's. As a laborer, he didn't have enough food or warm clothes. His physique was weak, and his bones weren't good. In contrast, Bi Hao, looked after by his uncle, lived a very comfortable life.

Li Xian endured the pain without saying a word. Bi Hao, however, let out a miserable cry. After being struck, he wanted to create distance. From a glance, it seemed as if Bi Hao was the one with the fractured bone.

"Trying to run!"

Li Xian only knew three moves. This combination of moves had to be unexpected and achieve victory in one go; otherwise, it would be useless. In that moment, his left hand shot out, using the skill [Weeding].

There was naturally no grass to be weeded on this擂台, but Li Xian's target was Bi Hao's hair!

He grabbed a handful of hair, and the third move, [Raising Bull Head], met Bi Hao's face perfectly.

As this punch landed, Bi Hao's facial features were all caved in. A patch of hair on his head was pulled out by the roots, oozing threads of blood.

Li Xian then delivered a final kick, kicking him off the擂台.

At the same time, the last bit of the incense burned out. Everything was timed perfectly!

He didn't need to win many times; he just needed to win the most crucial one.

Bi Hao covered his scalp. A touch brought a hand full of blood. He inhaled sharply from the pain and cursed, "Damn it! You bastard!"

"You lowly dog, you lowly dog! I'll kill you!" Bi Hao rolled up his sleeves, wanting to get back on the stage for another fight. He had already come to his senses; the kid's fist technique wasn't complete. Otherwise, he would have seized the opportunity to kill him, not just kick him off the擂台.

"You, kid, you've been hiding deep enough."

"Hiding so deep, probably just for this one moment. If we go again, you'll see how I cripple you." Bi Hao's face was full of viciousness; he was extremely angry in his heart.

"The match is over," Pang Long said calmly.

Bi Hao was stunned, only then did he come back to his senses. He looked at the long incense beside him; it had burned out, and the smoke had already dispersed.

His heart sank. He didn't care about anger anymore. Suddenly, he didn't know where he was or what to do. He said in a daze, "I... I lost?!"

He confirmed it repeatedly in his heart, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. The guards and laborers all had strange expressions; no one had expected this outcome.

"The guard recruitment match... lost? Lost to the most unremarkable lowly slave?"

The outline of the truth gradually became clear.

A buzzing sound filled his mind.

A moment later, a faint hope remained in his heart: "Even if I fell off the擂台, my martial arts attainments are clearly superior, not something these lowly slaves can compare to. Perhaps I have already won Commander Pang's appreciation! If I fight for it a bit more, there's still a chance!"

So he mustered his courage and said, "Commander Pang, the rules are dead, but people are alive. My martial arts are higher than his, as everyone has seen. The purpose of the match is, I presume, to select talented individuals with strong martial arts. Could I... have another match with that lowly... Brother Li?"

As soon as he finished speaking.

Pang Long said calmly, "The match is over. Li Xian is the victor."

"Commander Pang... Commander Pang..." Bi Hao became even more panicked.

"Return to the laborer's quarters," Pang Long concluded, waving his hand impatiently.

"But..." Bi Hao gritted his teeth, his heart filled with extreme unwillingness. "Commander Pang, I object to the rules. This is unfair. I implore..."

Pang Long looked at him, but did not speak.

Bi Hao suddenly came to his senses and shrank his head. "Commander Pang's word is final. I... I lost."

Li Xian let out a heavy breath, thinking to himself, "I have finally taken the first step. Today's great gamble was not in vain."

"That Bi Hao, who tried every trick and schemed a thousand times, probably never would have imagined that he would end up losing to me. He must hate me to the core right now."

He couldn't help but look at Bi Hao.

"It's ruined, it's all ruined. I... I prepared so painstakingly, but in the end, I still lost!"

"He's so lowly, yet he had to compete with me. Wouldn't it have been better to just be a laborer honestly? Damn it, damn it. What will I say to Uncle Luo if he finds out?"

Bi Hao was dispirited, his mind in a daze as if in a dream, his heart in a tangled mess. He was unwilling to accept this reality.

Li Xian walked over to him and cupped his fists. "Brother Bi, thank you for taking care of me in the laborer's quarters."

"You lowly..." Bi Hao was about to curse, but met Li Xian's smiling face.

Li Xian was now a guard. The term "lowly slave" should now be Li Xian's to curse him with.要知道, his uncle Luo Fang, was able to become a steward, also relying on the fact that he used to be a guard!

Becoming a guard meant there was a chance to get in touch with some superficial martial arts that the Madam might reveal! For ordinary people, getting a bit of it could be a lifetime of benefit, and Luo Fang was a prime example.

The reversal of identity and change in status made Bi Hao feel even worse. All of this, all of this, was supposed to be his!

"Brother Li, congratulations," Bi Hao said with a smile that was uglier than a cry.

"Same to you, same to you." Li Xian originally wanted to retort and curse Bi Hao as a lowly slave to vent his anger. But then he thought, the term "lowly slave" was better left unsaid.

The one being cursed would naturally feel terrible. But the one cursing... would indirectly admit that both their own and others'人格 are lowly: as long as one has a higher status, one can treat those of lower status as beasts. In this way, it is the one cursing who more strongly identifies with the label of "lowly slave." When facing people of higher identity and status in the future, they would unconsciously feel inferior, placing themselves in the "lowly slave" category. After all, they themselves treat their subordinates the same way.

Li Xian could adapt to the rules of this world and climb up step by step. But he was unwilling to be assimilated and become someone like Bi Hao.

Hearing the words "same to you," Bi Hao felt a stabbing pain in his heart. This power was far more damaging than foul language.

Bi Hao squeezed out from between his teeth: "Same... same to you." Covering his闷 chest, he hurriedly walked out of the large courtyard.

In the distance, Pang Long nodded secretly.

He is successful but not arrogant, enduring but not cowardly.

This kid... is quite interesting.

"Newcomer, come with me," Pang Long called out.
