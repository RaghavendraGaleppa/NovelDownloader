# Chapter 271: The Monk Who Buries Love? The Divine Monk Huai Kong (1/2)

The next morning, at dawn.

Inside the minor heaven of the Water Clan's side hall.

Within the rushing river, a flood dragon shadow surged upstream, churning up great sprays of white foam as it occasionally dodged the reefs hidden beneath the water.

The current grew faster and faster, yet the flood dragon within the water was never washed away.

Speed had always been Little Li's weak point.

Now, transformed into the body of a flood dragon, a little practice in the water felt like divine assistance.

*Boom—*

Water splashed violently as the flood dragon shadow leaped into the air, transforming in mid-air into a bare-chested youth.

Under the sunlight, the upper body of the Heavenly Flood Dragon, Little Li, was muscular yet possessed the streamlined beauty of a leopard. A faint black luster shimmered over his skin. Though his frame wasn't large, he gave off an aura of immovability.

The flood dragon shadow behind him added a touch of extraordinary, sharp-edged majesty to the young man.

This was evident from the expressions of the female demons not far away.

"The demon clan is indeed gifted with extraordinary talent," Li Mo couldn't help but sigh as he shook the water droplets from his body.

His speed in the water now was only slightly slower than Huang Donglai's speed on land.

The benefits were great.

But there were downsides as well.

Uncle Chen came for a longer time every morning, and many restless thoughts would surface in his mind...

At times like these.

To clear his mind, Little Li could only gaze at the ice lump in his mind—the Painting of Ascending the Dao—using the moonlight to calm his heart.

However, his soul didn't grow much; as a demon, he could no longer observe other divine intents.

"No wonder Brother Murong always fails to abstain from lust," Li Mo deeply understood just how soft Brother Murong's weak point was.

Softness and hardness sometimes complement each other. If one place is too soft, it causes another place to be too hard.

*Whoosh—*

At that moment, the turbulent river slowed down. Wu Qing looked at him with satisfaction and surprise.

"Not bad. You have already mastered the Water Control Technique of the鸣蛟 (Ming Flood Dragon) clan."

"Back when I was at the Seventh Grade, my speed was about the same."

Li Mo cupped his fists. "Thank you for your help, Auntie. I haven't seen Brother Murong for the past two days. How is his cultivation at the Empty Mountain Temple?"

As he spoke, he took out some dried meat for breakfast to fill his stomach.

"He..." Wu Qing's expression was complex.

"Xiao'Er faced considerable resistance when he tried to join the Empty Mountain Temple as a demon."

"Ah... after all, this is a pure land of Buddhism," Li Mo nodded, understanding.

"And the great masters also said that Xiao'Er finds it difficult to sever his worldly attachments, especially regarding love..."

Li Mo thought of the instincts deeply ingrained in male flood dragons and sighed. "Brother Murong has actually been working hard all along, it's just that it hasn't been of much use."

"Yes, fortunately, his spiritual roots are excellent. It was only because Great Master Hengyuan overruled the opposition that he was accepted and even given a Dharma name."

"What is it?" Li Mo took a bite of his dried meat. The thought of having to call him by his Dharma name next time made him feel it was somewhat amusing.

"Zang Ai (Burying Love)."

*Pfft—*

Li Mo spat out his dried meat.

The name was fitting, but it sounded strange.

Zang... Master Zang Ai?

A non-mainstream monk?

Well...

It was indeed quite non-mainstream for Brother Murong to become a Buddhist disciple as a half-demon.

*Dong—*

As they spoke, a bell sound pierced through the clouds and entered the minor heaven.

It was the signal for the morning recitation at the Empty Mountain Temple, also reminding the demons in every minor heaven.

The competition for the Celestial Jade was about to begin.

Li Mo walked out of the minor heaven with the other demons. Passing by the Tree of Affinity, they arrived in front of the main hall of the Empty Mountain Temple. Although it was called the main hall, it wasn't as resplendent as a typical temple; instead, it was an ancient, unadorned monastery.

Many demons had already gathered here.

Besides the Disaster Beast clans, the young talents from the major clans of the Southern Frontier had followed their elders to converge at this place.

The moment Li Mo arrived, his gaze swept through the crowd of demons while he activated his Eye of Fate.

The ice lump hadn't arrived yet.

---

He simply took out a small notebook and began taking notes.

Not long after.

Information suddenly appearing before him made him pause.

The young man had golden hair, golden eyes, golden armor, and golden wings, with an aquiline nose... It was exactly that male bird who had been blocked by a group of female demons and came along to join the fun previously.

【Name: Zhi Duo Luo】
【Age: 29 (4120)】
【Physique: Golden Peng Bloodline】
【Realm: Seven Apertures of Observation.】
【Fate: Blue with a hint of Purple】
【Evaluation: The God Son of the Hundred Beasts Hall, a branch of the Summon Demon Cult. Created by Han Zhen before the fall of the Great Shang Dynasty, using his own Way of Profound Mystery combined with the Golden Peng divine intent. He has been sleeping in the Southern Frontier for many years, practicing the True Scripture of Summoning Gods, growing his soul through incense and wish power, with the ultimate goal of allowing the Golden-Winged Great Peng, one of the Great Shang's totems, to reappear in the human world.】
【Recent Encounter: Intended to take advantage of the mutual destruction of Wu Mo and Luan Bing to be the fisherman who gains from the conflict.]

No wonder Zhi Duo Luo blocked the way that day.

He was clearly eyeing Li Mo's so-called 'True Dragon Bloodline'!

"Why is it the Summon Demon Cult again..."

Li Mo scanned the half-demons beside him.

Indeed.

They were all people from the Summon Demon Cult, all ranked on the Hidden Dragon List, and with quite high rankings.

"The Empty Mountain Temple stands aloof from the world and never fights with other forces."

"The strong within the temple might not be unaware, but they probably don't intend to do anything about it..."

Li Mo retracted his gaze.

His expression was a bit strange.

Mutual destruction?

Him and the ice lump?

Little Li suddenly realized he was taking things too seriously. These few half-demons might not pose much of a threat to him at all.

Unless the Summon Demon Cult wanted to make a big fuss in the Empty Mountain Temple's territory.

He just needed to be a little careful.

"The Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan has arrived."

"Just by looking at her appearance, you can tell she is definitely a pure-blooded Azure Luan. Even if the True Phoenix descended to the world, it would be about the same."

"Keep your voice down. She looks cold, but she's ruthless. Since she appeared, she has slain over a hundred Disaster Beasts, averaging two a day."

"She's looking at me?"

"Looking at your grandmother's leg, she's looking at Wu Mo!"

"Archenemies, they must be archenemies. Otherwise, how could they spot each other in a crowd of demons like that?"

The demons whispered and discussed in low voices.

Heavenly Flood Dragon Little Li lowered his gaze.

Then he saw the silk socks peeking out from her fair ankles. Li Mo couldn't help but curl the corner of his mouth.

"Hmph..."

The cold and pure Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan let out a soft snort.

To outsiders, she was clearly angry. She was already as noble and aloof as a lotus, something to be admired from afar, and this cold snort made the air in the field turn icy.

However, in the eyes of Heavenly Flood Dragon Little Li, it was truly captivating.

To be honest, if it were before, he would have found that frosty jade-like face too cold to approach.

But who could it be that the silk socks were a gift from him...

As for the group of half-demons led by Zhi Duo Luo, the corners of their mouths couldn't help but curl up uncontrollably.

A fight.
There would definitely be a fight.
And then they would sow discord...

Hehehe!

"Amitabha."

After a Buddhist chant, a group of monks walked out from the main hall, led by Hengyuan and others wearing patchwork robes.

The leading old monk had white eyebrows, and his robe was tattered. If he stood on the street and mingled with beggars, people would only think he was the cleaner one among them.

However, all the demons present lowered their heads to pay their respects; no one dared to underestimate this abbot of the Empty Mountain Temple.

The Divine Monk Huai Kong, a Seventh Grade Master of Profound Mystery.

This was the reason why, for the Celestial Jade, all demon clans had to follow the rules of the Empty Mountain Temple to compete for it.

At this moment.

The gaze of this Master of Profound Mystery suddenly fell upon the young man and woman standing at the very front of the demon crowd.

Huai Kong was stunned.
