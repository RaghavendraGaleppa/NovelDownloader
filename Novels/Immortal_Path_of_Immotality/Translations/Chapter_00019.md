# Chapter 19: The Tomb's Sudden Change  

The night was pitch black, so dark that one couldn't see their own hand in front of their face.  

The tunnel, though rough and uneven, wasn’t too difficult to traverse. Lin Shan stumbled forward, taking about a hundred steps, when suddenly he felt a chilling draft sweep through the air. The path beneath his feet became smoother.  

He knew he had left the tunnel and entered the tomb’s main passage.  

His steps slowed. The tomb passage was far more dangerous than the tunnel. The tunnel had been dug by grave robbers, but the passage was built by the tomb’s original architects—likely riddled with traps.  

The three groups that had entered before him hadn’t returned. Who knew whether they had fallen to zombies or traps? Unlike Wu Yuanwai’s five lackeys, Lin Shan wasn’t a professional grave robber. Those men had experience dealing with traps.  

Regret gnawed at him. He should have brought those five along.  

But then again, he still had Brother Rooster.  

Lin Shan patted the cage at his waist.  

Brother Rooster: "Cock-a-doodle-doo?"  

---  

After roughly two hundred steps, the dim glow of his firestarter revealed a pile of corpses ahead. Lin Shan halted, instantly alert.  

Moving cautiously forward, he saw that the bodies were riddled with arrows, most already rotting and foul. He couldn’t discern their origins—their clothes were indistinguishable amidst the bloodstains coating the walls and floor.  

Lin Shan removed the cage, opened the wire door, and pulled out the shivering rooster. He tied a rope around its leg, then removed the cloth gag. The rooster, surprisingly well-behaved, didn’t squawk or run. Instead, it huddled close to Lin Shan, unwilling to leave.  

A cold wind howled through the passage, the darkness ahead yawning like a gaping maw.  

"Go on," Lin Shan coaxed. "There’s sorghum ahead—your favorite."  

Brother Rooster didn’t budge.  

"Go on, there are young hens waiting for you!"  

The rooster pressed closer.  

**THUD!**  

Lin Shan kicked it forward.  

A flurry of feathers scattered as Brother Rooster reluctantly began scouting ahead.  

---  

The rope lengthened as the rooster moved deeper.  

"Were these people killed by something other than traps? Did I misjudge?"  

Just as doubt crept in, the rooster suddenly let out a frantic "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" followed by the terrifying *whoosh* of arrows slicing through the air.  

Lin Shan ducked, watching in horror as a storm of arrows rained down. A dark shape—Brother Rooster—dodged frantically amidst the barrage.  

Three breaths later, silence returned.  

Lin Shan’s back was drenched in cold sweat. Had he been in the rooster’s place, he’d have been turned into a pincushion.  

But now, with the trap exposed, how was he supposed to proceed?  

Before he could ponder further, the rope jerked. A dark figure hopped toward him.  

"Cock-a-doodle-doo!"  

Lin Shan: "..."  

It survived?  

Holding the firestarter closer, he confirmed it was indeed Brother Rooster—now nearly featherless and looking utterly miserable.  

Encouraged, Lin Shan sent the rooster forward again.  

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*  

"Cock-a-doodle-doo!"  

As expected, another volley of arrows erupted. Yet, after a chaotic dance of squawks and hops, Brother Rooster emerged unscathed once more.  

Truly, a legend. Lin Shan gave a mental salute.  

After several more attempts, the trap finally exhausted its arrows.  

Thus, a man followed a rooster through the eerie tomb passage.  

---  

The deeper they went, the colder the air became. Lin Shan shivered, goosebumps never leaving his skin.  

They passed two more clusters of corpses—some frozen to death, others torn apart by claw marks. Lin Shan examined them grimly, noting intestines spilled across the ground.  

The brutality was unmistakable.  

These victims had likely fallen to the ancient corpse. Their positions—heads facing outward—suggested they had fled from deeper within, only to be hunted down.  

Lin Shan’s instincts screamed at him to turn back. The ancient corpse was too close.  

Yet, after coming this far without finding any antiques imbued with ancient essence, returning empty-handed felt unbearable.  

Another voice argued: *You’ve already entered the tomb. Taking a few relics from the dead would suffice as proof for Nightingale. You’re young—there’s no need to throw your life away.*  

But the temptation of potential treasures gnawed at him.  

Lost in thought, Lin Shan suddenly felt dizzy. The cold had seeped into his bones. How had those grave robbers survived this?  

Gritting his teeth, he lit two more firestarters. The feeble warmth was little comfort.  

At some point, he lost the rope. Brother Rooster was on its own now.  

The passage widened, its walls covered in black moss—damp and fuzzy under his fingers. The floor bore only scattered footprints, no more corpses.  

The darkness stretched endlessly, the flickering firelight his sole companion.  

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he turned a corner and spotted a figure slumped against the wall.  

The corpse, long dead, clutched a broken sword—its other half embedded in its chest. A green-black claw mark marred its side.  

Lin Shan examined it silently. This was likely the first-rate expert from the three groups. He had tried to defend himself but was instantly overpowered.  

Beyond this corner lay the ancient corpse’s resting place—and the antiques Wu Yuanwai’s men had abandoned.  

Now, the final choice:  

*Advance or retreat?*  

Having come this far, Lin Shan’s resolve hardened.  

Human nature dictated that hesitation thrived with options, but a glimmer of hope could ignite defiance.  

*Fortune favors the bold.*  

Tightening his coat, Lin Shan drew his ring-pommeled saber and positioned the gourd of black dog blood for quick access.  

His goal was clear: retrieve the antiques, avoid the ancient corpse, and leave immediately.  

But he prepared for the worst.  

*If discovered, find an antique with ancient essence, enhance the saber into a divine weapon, and use the dog blood to gain the upper hand. If the essence is sufficient, upgrade the saber twice...*  

Meticulously planning each step, Lin Shan edged toward the corner.  

Just as he moved—  

**BOOM!**  

A thunderous explosion rocked the tomb. A shockwave hurled him backward.  

Before he could react, the wall before him shattered, revealing a vast underground plaza.  

Stone pillars lined the space, each crowned with eerie ghost flames that flickered stubbornly against the turbulent air.  

At the plaza’s center, dust swirled amidst deafening thunder and furious roars.  

Lin Shan coughed blood, his body wracked with pain. The musty stench of centuries-old decay choked him.  

One moment, he had been strategizing. The next, he was flattened by an unseen battle’s aftermath.  

**"ROAR!"**  

A furious bellow echoed. A charred, severed torso—half of a monstrous figure—landed beside Lin Shan.  

Blackened skin, fanged jaws, and clawed hands left no doubt.  

"The ancient corpse!"  

Before Lin Shan could process this, an earth-shaking voice boomed:  

**"Remnants of the Black Lotus Sect! Today, you meet your end!"**
