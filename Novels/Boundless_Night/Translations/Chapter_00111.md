**Chapter 111: Breakthrough**

Qin Ming's exhaustion from the battle vanished, as if he had consumed a powerful tonic. His sluggish essence, qi, and spirit instantly revitalized. Even with his wounds and bloodstains, it was clear he had regained his vigor.

"What a wonderful place!" he exclaimed, his wounds seemingly less painful.

The stone door behind them slowly closed, but the Mountain River Spirit Nest wasn't dark. Spiritual light shimmered, rising from the earth's ley lines. Although there was a stone table and copper lamp in the Spirit Nest, its overall structure was naturally formed. A pool lay before them, within which two types of spiritual light intertwined, resembling two fish chasing each other. From a crevice in the Mountain River Spirit Nest, mist billowed out, shaped like a large tree, scattering flakes of shimmering light that drifted down like falling leaves.

The Spirit Nest was less than a hundred square meters. The stone walls bore peculiar patterns; upon closer inspection, they appeared to be natural cloud formations, some even resembling characters.

Li Qingyue spoke, "Words formed by natural patterns are highly favored by transcendent practitioners for copying. From them, one can comprehend extraordinary powers."

She was no longer so dispirited; her condition was improving, and her eyes regained their luster. Her tattered silver armor, set against her snow-white skin, exuded a unique and unconventional beauty.

"You'll be able to recover, right?" Qin Ming asked with concern.

"No problem at all. I might even advance further," Li Qingyue nodded. Her consciousness light shone brightly again, and her Yellow Court was revitalized.

"That's good," Qin Ming sighed in relief. He then asked, "My essence, qi, and spirit are growing stronger and stronger, like I'm continuously drinking powerful tonics. What's happening?"

Li Qingyue smiled, "There's a special substance here, or rather, a peculiar energy, that stimulates the human spiritual field. Don't worry, the periphery of the Spirit Nest won't harm us. It's harmless; for people like us, it will only bring positive transformations."

The first realm for transcendent practitioners is Mind Purifying. It involves opening the consciousness light, which is related to the spiritual field, forming their foundation. Transcendent sects value spirit nests mainly because of their connection to these areas.

Qin Ming was surprised, "This is just the peripheral area?"

Li Qingyue nodded, "Yes. Adapt to it first. If you feel no issues, you can try entering the core area with me." She was heavily injured and dared not venture immediately into the depths of the Mountain River Spirit Nest. She needed to recover her state here.

Qin Ming nodded. If merely being here felt like consuming a tonic, what would it be like in the core area of the Spirit Nest? He was quite expectant. He carefully observed the stone cave, his expression one of astonishment. Some stone walls surprisingly bore natural depictions of soaring immortals, which were truly magnificent. He mused to himself, "Could those folk legends have originated from seeing these natural patterns?"

Li Qingyue said, "Transcendent practitioners only speak of being 'near-immortal,' never of 'ascending to immortality.' Their ultimate goal is to seek truth."

"That's very profound!" Qin Ming pondered. During the pioneering era, the incredibly powerful beings discovered by various factions in the depths of the Night Mist World were only referred to as near-immortal creatures, god-like beings, and so on.

Li Qingyue evidently thought of something as well. "We must strive to improve ourselves. The population is growing rapidly, and high-grade fire springs are becoming scarce. When the giant cities need to expand, it will likely be time to venture into the depths of the Night Mist World for pioneering. The Great Opening Era brings both endless opportunities and various dangers."

"Indeed!" Qin Ming nodded seriously. He had heard Meng Xinghai mention these things. The future was likely to be a grand era accompanied by glory, bloodshed, brilliance, and elegies, full of uncertainties.

Qin Ming circulated the Silk Scripture technique to treat his injuries. Nourished by the peculiar substance within the Spirit Nest, he recovered rapidly. His three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit were exceptionally abundant.

Li Qingyue said, "It seems you're very adaptable here. Come with me into the core area of the Spirit Nest and try it. If you feel any pain, tell me immediately, and I'll get you out right away." Now she was radiant, her pale face regaining its crystal-clear luster. She once again appeared ethereal and otherworldly, like a celestial immortal draped in tattered armor.

"I don't think it'll be a problem," Qin Ming said.

Li Qingyue smiled without a word. She channeled the divine light born from her Yellow Court to impact a stone slab on the ground engraved with dense runes. As immortal mist permeated the air and spiritual light intertwined, the area quickly opened, revealing a second layer, the core of the Mountain River Secret Nest, which had previously been hidden.

Li Qingyue floated down lightly. After landing, she took a deep breath. Her shattered silver armor clanged softly, resonating with her. She used a secret method to heal her injuries, completely relaxing her body and mind. Qin Ming saw that there were numerous light points distributed in the void of the stone cave below.

As he landed in the core area of the second layer of the Mountain River Spirit Nest, he instantly felt dizzy and lightheaded, stumbling on his feet, almost falling over. This time, it was Li Qingyue's turn to steady him, asking concerned, "Are you very uncomfortable? I'll send you out." She reassured Qin Ming that he could still gain many benefits from the first layer of the Spirit Nest.

Qin Ming shook his head, "At first, I felt like I was drunk. Now, I'm just slightly tipsy, completely relaxed in body and mind. My condition has never been better." This was true; he was surprisingly adaptable to this place.

Li Qingyue held him, saying, "Don't force yourself. If you get a headache, tell me immediately, or something serious could happen." The Mountain River Spirit Nest could stimulate the spiritual field and enhance consciousness light. However, if one wasn't a transcendent practitioner and didn't follow that path, they wouldn't be able to withstand the divine energy of this place.

"I'm really fine," Qin Ming said, then began practicing his techniques, performing the Golden Silkworm Art and Li Fire Energy. His entire body felt light, as if he were soaking in a hot spring, incredibly comfortable. Especially his head, where a warm current surged, making him want to hum softly in pleasure.

"You... were probably delayed. Perhaps you could also walk the path of a transcendent practitioner," Li Qingyue showed a strange expression. This old friend had progressed extremely fast on the path of rebirth, capable of slaying Outer Saints after five rebirths. Now, he seemed to also be able to embark on her path, which was truly rare.

Li Qingyue said, "The Cui family, in order to protect Cui Chonghe, said that your natural talent was extraordinary. Looking at it now, they weren't wrong." She felt it was a pity that Qin Ming had been hidden away for many years, completely unable to access what he should have learned.

"It's nothing. If I have talent in this area, it's not too late to start now," Qin Ming said. There was no use regretting it now; time couldn't be reversed.

Subsequently, he practiced the techniques from the Silk Scripture here. This was his fundamental scripture, capable of governing all techniques like Li Fire and Golden Silkworm. The place quieted down. Both began to heal their injuries, circulating their respective fundamental techniques.

Qin Ming immersed himself. Silver mud and golden threads emerged on his body's surface, forming the Golden Thread Jade Robe, which covered him, flowing with a hazy immortal mist. This was truly rare; usually, this phenomenon only appeared when his body underwent rebirth and he fell into a deep sleep.

After Qin Ming's wounds healed, the scabs began to fall off automatically. Though it was only a slight sound, it still startled Li Qingyue. She saw the Golden Thread Jade Robe on Qin Ming and also noticed a faint spiritual light emerging on his forehead. She murmured, "His consciousness light is already beginning to overflow even before he has truly embarked on the path of a transcendent practitioner. This truly indicates extraordinary talent."

When Qin Ming opened his eyes, he found Li Qingyue looking at him. "What's wrong?" he asked.

"I'll impart a mantra to you. Try it here."

"The path of transcendence?" Qin Ming asked.

"This mantra cannot be passed on to others," Li Qingyue cautioned.

"Okay!" Qin Ming nodded. He began to breathe, circulating a special breathing technique, accompanied by corresponding movements.

"Very fast progress. At this rate, you'll soon awaken your consciousness light," Li Qingyue nodded, though without too much surprise. An hour later, Qin Ming opened his eyes. True consciousness light intertwined before his forehead; he had indeed entered the path.

Soon, his expression subtly changed. He had actually cultivated a wisp of consciousness light using the Silk Scripture technique, and now it had merged with the light he had just formed. Afterwards, the merged consciousness light flowed throughout his body, with only a small amount remaining. Qin Ming carefully felt it and discovered that his physical qualities had improved!

"What's happening?" he was somewhat confused.

After listening to his detailed explanation, Li Qingyue's voice softened, "Could it be that you are naturally suited for the path of bodily mutation?"

Qin Ming was lost in thought. "My path, in the rebirth stage, primarily focuses on improving physical qualities. It's only in the manifestation stage that it first involves the power of consciousness. Has the premature birth of consciousness light now been corrected back to its original trajectory? But the gained spiritual power hasn't been lost; it has just nourished my flesh and blood!" Not all of his consciousness light had returned to nourish him; a portion still remained.

Li Qingyue examined his body, "The stronger your physical body, the more consciousness light it can bear, as if maintaining a state of balance." She smiled, "That's good too. Specialization allows one to go further. Moreover, when your flesh and blood become strong enough in the future, anything is possible."

Qin Ming pondered if this was due to his body's unique constitution or a characteristic of the Silk Scripture technique.

"Don't just stare blankly. Your current state isn't bad either," Li Qingyue said. She activated her consciousness light, injecting it into the various mysterious symbols on the stone walls. These were arrangements made by her patriarch, capable of fully reviving the Mountain River Spirit Nest. "You should be able to adapt to the divine energy here now."

A moment later, the previously scattered light points in the void connected and began to arrange themselves in an orderly fashion. Ripples, like water waves, appeared one after another in the Mountain River Spirit Nest, covering both of them and greatly stimulating their consciousness light.

Li Qingyue's injuries were healing. Her tattered battle armor hummed continuously, and like her body, it became crystalline and translucent, emitting a dazzling radiance. The power of consciousness she could mobilize naturally far surpassed Qin Ming's current stage. Her wounds healed at a visible rate, minor bone fractures automatically mended, and her Dao bones became as sturdy as before. In her sea of consciousness, a golden sun seemed poised to leap out of the dense misty surface, its spiritual light blooming, about to dispel the dark fog.

Qin Ming discovered that he didn't need to circulate any technique at all; his consciousness light was improving as if it were receiving some kind of radiation, stimulating his spiritual field, and thus undergoing a qualitative change!

"No wonder it's called the Mountain River Spirit Nest!" he exclaimed. Since circulating any technique had little effect, he simply let go, passively accepting the Spirit Nest's radiation and stimulation, allowing his spiritual field to change. His consciousness light improved quickly, and its consumption was not slow, almost simultaneously nourishing his flesh and blood.

"This isn't exactly a sixth rebirth for me, but the effect is no worse!" Qin Ming found that the divine energy fed back from the spiritual domain was continuously enhancing his physique, and his Heavenly Light was also growing stronger. He felt incredibly satisfied, truly perceiving the changes within himself, which were no less significant than a rebirth!

"Since I don't need to circulate any technique, I'll practice the 'Wuji Sutra' here." Qin Ming wasted no time and began to study the newly acquired wondrous art. Through spiritual resonance, he had already grasped the true essence of this sutra. 'Wu' belongs to Yang Earth, and 'Ji' belongs to Yin Earth. The characters 'Wu' and 'Ji' are enough to indicate the domain it involves: this is a wondrous art related to earth. The disciples of the Tathagata sect praised it, saying it was more precious than the Li Fire Sutra, which was no exaggeration.

Qin Ming quickly became engrossed, eventually beginning to practice it. The Mountain River Spirit Nest was connected to the Earth's Ancestral Vein. Besides the divine energy that stimulated the spiritual field, what it had in abundance was earth vein essence. As soon as he began practicing, earthy yellow clouds and mist rose from beneath his feet, gradually engulfing him.

Outside the Luofu Immortal Mountain ruins, many people were closely monitoring the latest developments.

"It seems the near-immortal artifact is about to find its owner. The competition among the core disciples is becoming clearer."

"Brother Liu, I feel your junior brother is going to win."

"Not necessarily. Perhaps your junior sister will stand out and obtain the near-immortal artifact."

Some people talked with smiles, while naturally, others had grim expressions.

"Hmm, Li Qingyue still hasn't come out. Has she not given up yet? But all parties have confirmed that she suffered severe injuries, even affecting her foundation, completely disqualifying her from the competition."

"Perhaps the problem is more serious than we imagined. She might even be too weak to walk out."

***

In the Mountain River Spirit Nest, Li Qingyue had fully recovered. Her consciousness light was growing ever brighter, and her strength was slowly increasing, about to ascend to the next level. Qin Ming was completely engulfed by earthy yellow light mist. The 'Wuji Sutra' he practiced had already reached the introductory level. Furthermore, his flesh and blood were continuously nourished by the feedback from his consciousness light, already comparable to a sixth rebirth!
