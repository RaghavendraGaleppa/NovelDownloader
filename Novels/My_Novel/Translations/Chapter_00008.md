# Chapter 8: A Desperate Gamble, Strategy Amidst Brashness

Outside the estate's guard courtyard, a commotion erupted.

"Steward Luo, he ran this way!"

"What are you standing there for? Chase him! The audacity! I, Luo Fang, have never seen such a reckless and lawless menial servant!"

"But..."

"You bastard! You lowly scum, are you trying to protect him?"

Pang Long stared intently at the water clock before him. There was still half a quarter of an hour left before the time was up when he heard the noise. His eyebrows slightly furrowed.

"Who is making such a racket? Xiao Fang, go check it out."

"Yes!"

The guard standing to Pang Long's right bowed respectfully, took a few steps back, and turned to stride out of the courtyard.

Seeing the group of menial servants heading their way, he immediately frowned. "A guard recruitment competition is being held here. What is the meaning of this?"

Luo Fang glared at the leader of the Ninth Class. That man was certain that Li Xian was inside this courtyard.

*Why is that wretch so bold? How dare he stay out all night last night?*

He had already guessed the reason.

Somehow, he must have found out about the guard recruitment competition and foolishly hoped to become a guard, thereby escaping Luo Fang's control.

*The nerve!*

*In his dreams!*

"What a dead lowlife, daring to play tricks on me Luo Fang. Let's see how I'll deal with you!" Luo Fang muttered to himself.

When he looked at the guard Fang Tianyu, however, his expression turned into a friendly smile.

"Brother Fang, here's the situation: there's a scoundrel in our menial servant class who doesn't follow the rules and has committed a fault. To avoid punishment, he's trying to use the guard recruitment competition as a hiding place."

"What do you mean?" Fang Tianyu frowned.

Luo Fang thought, *Haven't I ever been a guard? You yellow-haired brat, what's there to be arrogant about?*

But considering Pang Long was in the courtyard, he remained respectful and said, "I, Luo Fang, naturally wouldn't dare to offend Lord Pang. But it is my duty, so I had no choice but to come here to ask for clarification."

"I hope you can help me report to Lord Pang and let him decide how to handle this matter."

Fang Tianyu heard this and thought it made sense. He immediately walked back into the courtyard and whispered the details to Pang Long.

Pang Long's gaze fell upon Li Xian upon hearing this. Li Xian stood tall and proud, meeting his gaze head-on without a hint of guilt.

After a moment, Pang Long said indifferently, "Go tell Luo Fang. The affairs of the menial servant room, I do not meddle in. I only know that right now, a guard recruitment competition is being held. All unrelated personnel, leave immediately."

"Yes!"

Fang Tianyu relayed the message verbatim. Luo Fang laughed and said, "Lord Pang is perfectly right, perfectly right."

He bowed and left the vicinity. Only after returning to the menial servant room did he explode in anger, making the hundred or so menial servants of the Ninth Class line up.

He lashed out with his whip.

"Does it hurt?"

"If you have to blame someone, blame your class for producing a white-eyed wolf."

After whipping them until their skin was broken and flesh was torn, he had people pour hot water on them first, then cold water, mercilessly tormenting those menial servants.

"What a Li Xian... I'd like to see what kind of waves you can stir up!"

"Heh, in the end, you'll still have to come back to me."

After venting his fury, Luo Fang tossed the whip aside and flexed his aching wrists.

The menial servants of the Ninth Class, bearing their injuries, were sent to do the dirtiest and most exhausting work.

Whenever the name "Li Xian" was mentioned, everyone harbored a fierce hatred, wishing to drink his blood and eat his flesh.

This was truly a strange matter.

It was Luo Fang who beat and scolded them, while Li Xian only fought back.

Yet this hatred was directed solely at Li Xian. When it came to "Luo Fang," the hatred would completely vanish, replaced by fear and respect.

It was utterly unreasonable.

"The time is up."

Pang Long stood up from his chair and announced, "The guard recruitment competition begins today."

"There is only one spot for this recruitment."

"The content is simple: a single arena has been set up in the courtyard. There is only one rule: within the time it takes for one incense stick to burn, the last person standing on the arena will be the new guard!"

As soon as his words fell, a menial servant was the first to leap onto the arena, warily scanning his surroundings.

It wasn't long before another menial servant climbed onto the stage. Both were menial servants, not particularly strong or robust. Their fight naturally lacked any aesthetic appeal.

But a certain ferocity...

It was truly shocking.

In the first match, one menial servant defeated another by biting off his ear.

The defeated servant rolled off the arena, while the victor was covered in blood.

Pang Long nodded secretly: "For a menial servant to turn his life around, he relies on... that kind of ferocity."

The other guards also watched with great interest.

After several matches, the casualties were surprisingly high.

Li Xian glanced at Pang Long, his mind replaying the rules of the competition.

"One incense stick's time... Whoever can stand until the end wins."

"In other words, there is no limit to the number of times one can step onto the arena. My only real opponent is Bi Hao."

"Why not step onto the arena early, pretend I don't know martial arts, deliberately mislead Bi Hao, and make him underestimate me?"

"Then, pretend to be defeated and get kicked off the arena, using that to lie low. When the incense is about to burn out, I'll get back on the stage... to fight for that one slim chance!"

Having thought of this plan.

Just as one match ended, Li Xian stepped directly onto the arena and entangled with a menial servant even thinner than himself.

He showed no technique at all, like a ruffian in a street fight, using teeth and claws without restraint. Striking the groin, clawing at the eyes... he used it all.

Bi Hao stood with his arms crossed, looking supremely confident and full of disdain. "How could these people be worthy opponents for me?"

"But Uncle Luo was right. These mad dogs, seeing their only chance to turn their lives around, are truly throwing their lives away."

"It's a shame they have no brains."

Bi Hao found it amusing.

Pang Long, however, frowned, a hint of disappointment in his eyes. "This kid Li Xian... is this all the ability he has?"

*Thud!*

Li Xian pushed his opponent off the arena with both hands, stood up panting, and roared, "Who's next!"

"I'll go!"

Another menial servant rushed onto the arena, lunging at Li Xian.

Although Li Xian intended to hide his true strength, it was not an easy task. Everyone was a cornered beast. In such a situation, the power a person could爆发 was terrifying!

*Rip...*

The menial servant's fingernails were extremely long, tearing Li Xian's arm. Li Xian cursed, "Get lost!"

He twisted his body and kicked the servant hard, sending him flying off the arena.

He didn't have to wait long.

Another servant immediately pounced, tackling Li Xian to the ground. This servant seemed to have learned wrestling and tried to lock him in a naked chokehold.

Li Xian's eyes turned ruthless. He reached out to gouge the man's eyes. The servant cried out in pain, and his strength momentarily faltered. Li Xian seized the opportunity to counterattack.

Using all his might, Li Xian won again.

The guard Fang Tianyu said, "This kid only has brute strength. If it weren't for that Bi Hao, he might have been chosen as a guard. Lord Pang, Bi Hao has a martial arts background. Isn't this a bit too unfair?"

"A rule is a rule. I don't discuss fairness with menial servants," Pang Long said indifferently.

As they were speaking.

Li Xian won another victory. The next match, however, saw Bi Hao step onto the stage.

Bi Hao said coldly and proudly, "White-eyed wolf, let me show you my strength. Go back to the menial servant room and behave yourself!"

Without another word, he kicked out. Li Xian could have dodged, but he deliberately pretended he couldn't, using the momentum to roll off the arena.

"What a vicious kick," Fang Tianyu said in surprise.

Bi Hao's kick had used hidden force, aiming for the internal organs. A person with a weaker constitution might have been killed by that one kick.

Li Xian was indeed in extreme pain. But he had internal energy to protect his body, so he didn't lose his ability to move.

He lay on the ground, not getting up. He pretended to be in agony, but his gaze was exceptionally calm as he secretly glanced at the incense stick in the distance.

The act was convincing enough!

He focused on recovering his strength while waiting for the final moment.

Bi Hao, with his martial arts foundation, was far superior to ordinary menial servants. Once he was on the stage, the situation became one-sided.

Even so, a few desperate madmen still managed to leave him wounded.

The incense burned bit by bit.

Bi Hao stood firm, looking down at the menial servants sprawled and groaning on the ground, and laughed loudly. "Hahaha, you pack of dogs! What makes you think you can compete with me? What makes you think you can compete with me?!"

Pang Long glanced at the incense and felt there would be no more surprises.

"The incense is about to burn out. If anyone wants to try, seize this last chance," Pang Long reminded them.

This guard recruitment competition... followed the usual conventions and ultimately failed to bring him any excitement.

At that moment, Li Xian slowly got to his feet. Without a word, he walked toward the arena once more.

"A defeated opponent! How dare you step onto the stage again?" Bi Hao flew into a莫名 rage upon seeing Li Xian climb back onto the arena.

Li Xian gently rubbed his stomach and stepped onto the stage, looking as if he were about to faint. But deep within his eyes, a sharp light was already brewing.
