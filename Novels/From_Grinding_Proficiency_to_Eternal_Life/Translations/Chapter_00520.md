# Chapter 520: Surging Undercurrents

The killing intent from the Divine霄 Nine Firmaments Profound Vault Indestructible True Lord, cultivated by Xu Yunfan, probed relentlessly, seeking the weak points in the sword intent to launch targeted assaults.

He naturally did not know where the flaws in this sword light lay, but the Eight Scenery Clouds were layered and all-encompassing. Given enough time, they would inevitably find them.

Seeing that his sword strike had not completely pierced through the Eight Scenery Clouds, Xu Yunfan secretly let out a sigh of relief.

The surprise in his eyes was unmistakable.

He truly had not expected that this profound artifact-refining law possessed such wondrous offensive capabilities.

The Eight Scenery Qi, condensed from the true art "Mysterious Capital Eight Scenery Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra," was far more mysterious than he had anticipated.

This true art truly deserved its reputation as one of the pinnacle true methods of the Mysterious Capital lineage within the Primordial Origin Sect.

The Eight Scenery Qi was not a uniform, pure energy. Its core essence lay in the vast power contained within the eight fundamental phases of heaven and earth: Qian (Heaven), Kun (Earth), Zhen (Thunder), Xun (Wind), Kan (Water), Li (Fire), Gen (Mountain), and Dui (Lake).

Within every wisp of cloud qi, it seemed as if a small cosmos was flowing.

Some were the earth's root marrow that carries all things with the virtue of厚土 (Rich Earth); some were the "highest good is like water" that nourishes and stimulates spiritual vitality; some were the Nine Heavens Thunder that is fierce and invincible, shattering all evil; some were the Pure Yang True Fire that gently warms all things and nurtures spiritual charm; and there were also the supreme functions of differentiating filth and stabilizing space.

The Sword Dao philosophy of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, "One Sword Breaks Ten Thousand Laws," emphasizes the reduction of countless sword intents to the simplest, purest, and sharpest point of锋芒 (edge). It uses an incomparably pure ultimate intent to sever all obstacles and reach the origin of the Dao.

This magnificent sword light was the perfect embodiment of this path; its concept of shattering all things was enough to tear through most conventional defenses.

However, at this moment, facing this peerless sword aura that severs causality and shatters ten thousand laws, the Eight Scenery Qi controlled by Xu Yunfan displayed a completely different approach.

The wondrous uses of the Eight Scenery Clouds, which were nearly perfected on his proficiency panel, flowed through Xu Yunfan's mind.

Even the creator of this art might not be able to use it better than Xu Yunfan.

The Eight Scenery Clouds did not engage in a head-on clash with extreme hardness but instead utilized its all-encompassing "Ultimate Complexity" attribute to evolve into endless variations.

He guided it with his spiritual sense, his mana surged, and he formed hand seals.

He transformed the Eight Scenery Qi into a giant, sky-covering cloud palm.

As soon as this giant palm took shape, the space under its笼罩 (envelopment) seemed to be solidified layer by layer, becoming sluggish and stagnant. This was the combined wondrous use of the Kan and Gen phases, creating an invisible "quagmire."

Simultaneously, the guided先天清浊之气 (Primordial Clear and Turbid Qi) circulated within the palm, transforming into the Primordial Turbid Evil Origin, which became the Filthy Yin power within the Kun phase. Like maggots in a bone, it continuously eroded and corroded the pure and sharp sword intent锋芒, causing its power to quietly dissipate.

Even more brilliantly, Xu Yunfan simultaneously operated the mana from the Divine霄 Nine Firmaments Profound Vault Indestructible Scripture, integrating the destructive power of the "Breaker of Armies" and "Killing伐" contained within it into the true meanings of the Li and Zhen phases of the Eight Scenery Qi.

Although this power did not directly clash with the strongest point of the sword aura, like tempered golden threads, it constantly wandered, probed, and searched for the weak gaps within the flowing intent of the sword light within the layered clouds, launching targeted assaults with the might of a thunderous rage.

This technique almost perfectly combined the sharp offensive power of the Divine霄 Nine Firmaments with the myriad transformations of the Eight Scenery Qi.

If not for the attribute panel, Xu Yunfan would not have been able to achieve this step.

However, upon second thought, recalling his recent arduous, ascetic-like closed-door cultivation, he realized these were the fruits of his hard work.

His talent was inherently如此 (like this).

For a time, the pure sword intent that should have been unstoppable and shattered all things was trapped in this "quagmire of change" woven from multiple fundamental attributes of heaven and earth.

The sword qi continuously tore through the layers of cloud curtains, but the Eight Scenery Qi was生生不息 (endlessly regenerative), with its attributes constantly shifting.

The spatial stagnation was regenerated as soon as it was broken; the turbid evil's contamination was seeped in again as soon as it was blocked; the thunderous killing intent was blocked, and a new gap was sought.

The power of the eight phases, under his exquisite control, combined and evolved, forming an extremely intricate and infinitely resilient net.

This ultimate "Complexity" and "Change" became the supreme method to restrain the condensed "Simplicity" and "Sharpness" of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

It even made Xu Yunfan feel that this Eight Scenery Clouds art was specifically created to counter the Sword Dao of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

It was just that the Eight Scenery Clouds was extremely difficult to master; controlling the eight types of cloud qi with microscopic precision was an almost impossible task for the vast majority of people.

As one side weakened and the other strengthened, although the magnificent sword light was still peerlessly sharp, it was like being trapped in a boundless swamp, being worn down layer by layer. Its speed was drastically reduced, and its brilliance visibly dimmed.

The sword light continued to erupt, breaking through layer after layer of clouds, but its speed was clearly obstructed, and its light began to fade.

Xu Yunfan wondered which Foundation Establishment perfection Great True Person from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect this was. With a single sword strike, it almost forced him to exhaust all his reserves just to delay it.

If there were another sword strike...

Xu Yunfan figured he might have to leave.

Just as Xu Yunfan was using the Eight Scenery Cloud Hand to wear down the magnificent sword light layer by layer.

In the core of the Eastern Wastes battlefield, the sky, which had been dyed with magnificent colors by the immense Buddhist light and Primordial Origin Immortal Qi, suddenly rose a pure, flawless, and lofty profound aura.

"Hmph!"

A light snort, implicitly carrying Dao authority, seemed to fall from the nine heavens, bearing a supreme will that governed all and defined the cosmos.

It was the Clear Source Wondrous Way承运 Profound Vault True Lord.

He was on the distant battlefield, but the aura of the Bodhi禅 that suddenly appeared in the寒鸦关 (Cold Crow Pass) direction had already alerted him.

Chu Chengnan's Golden Core Dao Comprehension was of great use to him, and he naturally would not allow others to disrupt the process. A considerable portion of his consciousness was tied up in it.

Almost at the instant the Great Awakening Bodhisattva's枯寂 (desolate) Buddhist hand seal, which contained the origin power of the Nirvanic Lotus Dao Fruit, was about to invisibly strike the foundation of Chu Chengnan's soul across an immeasurable distance.

*Hum!*

A pure, clear, and hazy immortal light arrived later but reached first.

This hazy immortal light was crisp and clear, without a grand and mighty aura, yet it was refined and condensed to the extreme, carrying an indescribable先天 Dao妙 (Primordial Dao Mystery).

This immortal light seemed to possess a will, spreading and diffusing silently in the void. Wherever it passed, it seemed as if all filth, defilement, and alien auras were forcibly cleansed and purified, returning to the most fundamental "Clear" and "Still."

This was the signature Dao method of the True Lord Clear Source, the Wondrous Way True Law of Heaven and Earth's Clear Qi.

The essence of this immortal light was the origin manifestation of the "Immortal Palace Clear Qi" condensed from his Golden Core mana.

The Nirvanic Lotus fire on the desolate Buddhist hand seal, which ignited the Dao Heart and extinguished the soul, and the concept of归化 (returning to transformation), upon contact with this hazy immortal light, were like残雪 (lingering snow) meeting the scorching sun, or like ink dripping into a pure, clear spring.

Silently and soundlessly, the Nirvanic Buddhist power and karmic牵引 (pull) contained in the Bodhisattva's finger, which was enough to severely injure or even extinguish a Foundation Establishment perfection Great True Person, was instantly包裹 (enveloped), neutralized, and消弭 (eliminated) by the seemingly gentle Immortal Palace Clear Qi.

There was no earth-shattering collision, no violent release of energy.

Only the purification and归元 (return to origin) belonging to a supreme Dao method.

The invisible Buddhist power shackles pointing at Chu Chengnan, under the True Lord Clear Source's precise remote intervention, were "erased" like this,消散 (dissipating) into nothingness, as if they had never appeared.
