# Chapter 94: Transaction  

"Fellow Daoist Qiu, can you still make a profit buying spirit rice at this price?" Li Shiming asked in surprise.  

"Of course, our shop doesn't do business at a loss. As you know, spirit rice isn't something that can be sold at a high price—it's already a low-margin business. Within the sect's territory, there aren't many primary spirit planters, and even fewer who cultivate spirit fields independently.  

"Changming Island's market is just one of many markets within the sect's territory. Spirit planters usually sign contracts with various spirit plant shops. If I offered a low price, wouldn't you be snatched up by another shop right away?" Qiu Tan explained frankly.  

Due to the climate conditions of the Tianhai Sect, the spirit fields within the Nine Peaks are protected by the sect's grand formation and aren't much affected by the weather.  

However, the spirit fields in the sea can only produce spirit rice for six months out of three seasons each year, making survival difficult for primary spirit planters.  

Thus, apart from the professional spirit planters trained by the Tianhai Sect, few cultivators who entered the sect through the Ascension Assembly chose to become spirit planters.  

This isn't to say that being a spirit planter is a bad profession, but in the early stages, it's more challenging compared to other auxiliary professions.  

Of course, this difficulty is relative. Compared to ordinary sect disciples, spirit planters still have it much better.  

The reason Qiu Tan paid special attention to Li Shiming was that he discovered Li Shiming was a newcomer in this batch.  

This batch was special. Normally, the Ascension Assembly would bring in thirty or forty newcomers each year, and with qualified newcomers from the sect's sea territory, the sect would gain fifty or sixty newcomers over five years.  

However, the incident where this year's spirit root seedlings were attacked, leaving only a few survivors, had long been spread among the sect's Qi Refinement disciples.  

Apart from deepening the enmity between the Tianhai Sect and the Xuanming Sect, it also made attentive Qi Refinement disciples take notice of this batch's spirit root seedlings.  

After meeting Li Shiming, Qiu Tan had someone investigate his background.  

Li Shiming was the only newcomer in this batch who had his own cave residence outside the sect. The other newcomers were still busy with the simplest tasks and hadn't even left the sect's Nine Peaks.  

Li Shiming was also the only spirit planter. Given the lack of talent in this batch, there wouldn't be any new spirit planters for at least the next five years.  

"I have two thousand catties of spirit rice here, and I also need to buy some spirit seeds!" Li Shiming said after some thought.  

He didn't want to bother selling it slowly. Spirit rice wasn't some treasure, and while the quantity was large, it could still be explained away.  

After all, he'd already been a spirit planter before joining the sect—the excess spirit rice was just his stockpile.  

"Two thousand catties of spirit rice?" Qiu Tan was momentarily stunned but quickly recovered, pulling Li Shiming into a nearby reception room.  

There were still two other customers in the shop, and Qiu Tan didn't want such a promising supplier to be poached by others.  

"Are you sure it's two thousand catties?" Once inside, Qiu Tan confirmed again.  

Li Shiming took out ten sacks from his storage bag, each containing two hundred catties of spirit rice.  

"Fellow Daoist Li, how about this? From now on, you supply your spirit rice exclusively to me, and I'll increase the purchase price by ten percent each time!" Qiu Tan said through gritted teeth after seeing the two thousand catties of spirit rice.  

Competition was fierce these days. Between markets and merchants, everyone had their own backing, so no one could resort to underhanded methods—they had to compete with better terms to secure suppliers.  

Qiu Tan treated spirit planters like Li Shiming as important future suppliers.  

But Li Shiming had surprised him. Two thousand catties of spirit rice suggested that Li Shiming must have some special method in spirit planting. Otherwise, given his age, even if he'd started cultivating as soon as his spirit root manifested at twelve, it would be hard to accumulate two thousand catties.  

Moreover, based on Qiu Tan's experience, this batch of spirit rice had all been produced within the past year.  

Qiu Tan didn't care what method Li Shiming used—he wasn't a spirit planter himself. But he was determined to keep Li Shiming as a supplier.  

"Deal," Li Shiming agreed after a moment's thought.  

A stable channel was a good thing. Even if he stopped planting spirit rice in his machine room space, his spirit fields would still produce over a thousand catties of spirit rice annually for sale.  

"By the way, what kind of spirit seeds do you need? As long as they're available within the sect's territory, I can get them for you!" Qiu Tan said, seeing that Li Shiming had agreed.  

They didn't discuss signing any contracts. Verbal agreements among cultivators were rarely broken.  

In the cultivator community, breaking an agreement was a serious matter—those who did would be ostracized by others.  

Unless it involved something extremely important, a verbal agreement was sufficient.  

"I've prepared a list," Li Shiming said, handing Qiu Tan a piece of paper.  

Qiu Tan took it and saw that some of the seeds were for expensive medicinal herbs that primary spirit planters could cultivate.  

Many primary spirit planters would buy seeds for such herbs, hoping that careful cultivation would yield a good harvest and earn them a tidy sum.  

Of course, the reason these herbs were expensive was their difficulty to cultivate. Even though they were within the capabilities of primary spirit planters, even intermediate spirit planters struggled to ensure survival rates.  

Qiu Tan knew this but didn't try to dissuade Li Shiming. Spirit planters grew by tackling difficult plants.  

There were also seeds for seasoning-type spirit plants. Seeing this, Qiu Tan couldn't help but smile, recalling how he'd met Li Shiming during a transaction involving sea boar meat.  

Clearly, Li Shiming had a thing for food. Seasoning-type spirit plants had little practical value but still took up space in spirit fields.  

Finally, there were seeds for three special medicinal herbs. When Qiu Tan saw these, he looked up at Li Shiming.  

"I can't get these three types of seeds, but if you really need them, I can try to find them for you. They should be available for purchase," Qiu Tan said honestly, though he had questions.  

He knew these three herbs were resources the Xuanming Sect sought. Such seeds wouldn't be found in the Tianhai Sect.  

But the war between the Tianhai Sect and the Xuanming Sect had lasted many years, with casualties on both sides and many storage bags seized.  

Most of the Xuanming Sect's resources were useless to Tianhai Sect cultivators.  

Qiu Tan planned to ask around among Tianhai Sect cultivators he knew. These three herbs, while valuable, weren't unheard of, so the chances of finding them were high.  

"Fellow Daoist Qiu, thank you so much! How much spirit stone will it cost?" Li Shiming was delighted to hear that the herbs could be purchased directly, but his funds were limited. These three herbs were late-stage Qi Refinement resources, and he might not have enough.  

"If you trust me, you can leave the 2,100 spirit stones from the two thousand catties of spirit rice, take the available spirit seeds, and I'll procure the three herbs for you. Any excess or shortfall in spirit stones can be settled later," Qiu Tan said generously.  

---  

Li Shiming flew on his paper crane, smiling. His trip to the market had gone well.  

He'd bought the spirit seeds he needed, sold his excess spirit rice, and even secured the last three materials needed for his bronze corpse to advance to iron corpse.  

He hadn't expected it to be so easy. The three materials that even the bronze corpse's original owner in the Xuanming Sect couldn't obtain were readily available through the Tianhai Sect.  

Qiu Tan had spoken with such confidence that Li Shiming suspected he already knew who had the materials.  

Li Shiming had also acquired the materials for talisman ink and all the relevant knowledge a Qi Refinement cultivator should possess, all at a low price with Qiu Tan's help.  

Apart from the 2,100 spirit stones from selling the spirit rice, he'd only spent a little over a hundred spirit stones.  

The most important gain was establishing a channel through Qiu Tan. Though Qiu Tan ran a spirit plant shop, he had deep connections with many stores. Through him, Li Shiming could sell or purchase any spiritual item.  

When he first left Changming Island's market, Li Shiming was extremely cautious, wary of a repeat of his experience at the rogue cultivator market.  

His first visit to a market as a cultivator was a memory he'd rather forget. If he hadn't thrown that "thermite bomb," his cultivation journey might have ended there.  

But Changming Island's market lived up to its reputation for safety. Even after flying for an hour, he encountered no pursuers.  

While IBMz15 monitored their surroundings, Li Shiming took out a jade slip containing knowledge for Qi Refinement cultivators.  

He pressed it to his forehead, and a flood of information entered his mind, also transmitted to IBMz15.  

The knowledge covered common spiritual herbs, ores, and materials a Qi Refinement cultivator might encounter. When traveling, cultivators could come across various spiritual items, and this knowledge would prevent missed opportunities due to ignorance.  

Some materials required special harvesting methods. Without them, even if collected, their spiritual energy would dissipate, greatly reducing their value.  

He also realized he lacked the standard containers most cultivators carried: jade boxes for storing herbs, a skinning knife at the artifact level, a container for spirit blood, and a vessel for collecting souls.  

These items were essential. Spirit herbs found in the wild would lose much of their energy without a jade box.  

The skinning knife, spirit blood container, and soul-collecting vessel were a set of artifacts for processing spirit beasts.  

The sea boar he'd encountered earlier had little value beyond its meat, but mid-to-high-tier spirit beasts had valuable hides, spirit blood, and souls. Without the right tools, much of their worth would be lost.  

The knowledge also covered elixirs—not for refining them, but for identifying them.  

Recognizing elixirs prevented cultivators from being cheated by unscrupulous merchants when purchasing them.  

Qi Refinement cultivators used first-grade elixirs, further divided into low, medium, high, and top quality based on efficacy and impurities.  

The quality mattered greatly for the effects and side effects of elixirs.  

For example, low-grade first-grade elixirs required careful management of elixir toxicity. While their effects were weaker, the toxicity had to be strictly controlled.  

Generally, there was a monthly limit on low-grade elixirs to prevent toxicity from affecting the body.  

Each step up in quality reduced toxicity and increased efficacy.  

Top-grade elixirs were the best—they had no toxicity, the strongest effects, and no resistance buildup.  

For cultivators, resistance was a hidden risk.  

It wasn't obvious in daily life, but when a cultivator who'd never taken elixirs and one who'd taken many both reached peak Qi Refinement and were given the same Foundation Establishment Pill and auxiliary elixirs, the former had a one-to-two times higher chance of success.  

This conclusion was the result of centuries of research by many factions in the cultivation world.  

Yet despite knowing this, cultivators still used elixirs to boost their cultivation.  

Not everyone was a prodigy with a single spirit root who could reach peak Qi Refinement effortlessly without elixirs.  

Top-grade elixirs, which didn't cause resistance, were rare due to their unpredictable production.  

Most alchemists only produced one or two top-grade elixirs in their lifetimes, with no clue how to replicate the process.  

The elixirs Li Shiming had obtained from loot—the Hao family's low-grade fasting pills and the Xuanming Sect disciple's medium-grade Xuan Yin Life Nourishing Pills—were of poor quality.  

He thought that even if he were starving, knowing the drawbacks of low-grade fasting pills, he wouldn't take them.  

The knowledge also covered artifacts.  

Within the sect, artifacts from Li Peak were the best. For sect disciples, artifacts were one of the few things they couldn't skimp on—they were matters of life and death.  

Thus, the knowledge strongly recommended that once a disciple had enough merit points, their first purchase should be a Li Peak artifact to strengthen themselves.  

Seeing this, Li Shiming took out his Spirit Turtle Shield and examined it closely, confirming it bore no Li Peak mark.  

"Ripped off," he muttered, shaking his head.  

He thought of the old cultivator's sincere farewell smile—of course it was sincere, given how much he'd profited!  

"I'll make do for now," he said, fiddling with the shield. It didn't seem bad, but he wasn't about to return to the market for another purchase.  

After inquiring about the prices of high-grade artifacts and flying boats, he realized just how poor he was. His savings were practically nothing.  

Even if he couldn't afford a spirit boat yet, he at least needed to replace his paper crane for faster travel over the sea.  

All of this required substantial spirit stones. He still had to cultivate and needed to save some for Qiu Tan's procurement of the three herbs.
