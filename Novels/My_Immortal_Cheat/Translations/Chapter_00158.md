Chapter 158: Departure

Lord of Thunder's glabella split open, and the Eye of Thunder opened once more. Simultaneously, a massive vertical pupil also opened in the void, brewing countless bolts of lightning. Thunderous dragons rolled within it, as if alive, emitting roars that shook the heavens.

This sight inspired awe. By now, everyone was fighting desperately. The divine thrones within the Pantheon were the utmost priority in their ancient gods' schemes; they absolutely could not afford to lose them.

Boom!

Zhou Changsheng's expression was fearless. A half-segment of an ancient pagoda floated above his head, from which golden glazed light drifted down. Although it appeared like flowing pulp, it was indestructible. The Grim Reaper's scythe hovered before him, seemingly chanting something as runes circulated, and wisps of black substance floated out, encircling Zhou Changsheng as if corroding the golden glazed light.

In the distance, Xuan Zhenzi sat cross-legged in the void, his entire body glowing. A cloud of purple qi floated above his head, and a tiny figure sat within it. He was fully activating the ancient pagoda. Although Zhou Changsheng currently appeared to possess unparalleled combat strength, it was, in fact, entirely due to the small pagoda's effect. Once Xuan Zhenzi was exhausted, Zhou Changsheng would also be finished immediately.

Wei Chuan's grandfather and the powerful expert from the light surrounded Xuan Zhenzi, guarding him against any unforeseen circumstances.

"Brother Changsheng, end this quickly! I can't hold on for much longer," Xuan Zhenzi secretly transmitted his voice to Zhou Changsheng. Every moment now was consuming his immense primordial essence; he was about to collapse.

Zhou Changsheng's expression remained unchanged, not betraying any hint to his opponents. He replied, "I understand!"

He clenched his fists, his body like divine gold, his eyes glowing, and his spirit like a divine rainbow. He activated a secret technique, restoring his injured body to its peak state. Relying on the ancient pagoda's protection, he ignored the Grim Reaper's divine abilities, his arm and fist resembling a great dragon.

"Lightning!" the Holy God Lord roared. At this moment, his hand rested on the Pantheon. Veins bulged on his slender, jade-like hand. Although the Pantheon now appeared to be only a palm-sized bronze ancient hall, its actual weight could crush a world. If not for a special method taught to him by the God-King, he would simply be unable to collect it.

"I am the Lord of Thunder! God of Ten Thousand Thunders!" The Lord of Thunder chanted a divine incantation. A thick pillar of lightning shot down from the thunder-eye, with countless lightning dragons entwined around it, firmly locking onto Zhou Changsheng.

Boom!

The lightning pillar struck the ancient pagoda above Zhou Changsheng's head. In the distance, Xuan Zhenzi spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, his body becoming unstable. His hands moved rapidly, forming profound seals. The golden glazed light descending from the half-segment of the ancient pagoda also dimmed slightly, but it eventually stabilized. However, Zhou Changsheng's forward momentum paused momentarily.

"Hah!" Zhou Changsheng watched as the Holy God Lord was about to collect the Pantheon, and crimson fire overflowed from his eyes. Nine true dragons appeared out of thin air, encircling him. He reached out and grasped the ancient pagoda above his head, his body sinking slightly. Veins bulged on his hand as the nine true dragons converged upon it, forming profound patterns that shone with golden radiance.

"Zhou Changsheng, you bastard!" Xuan Zhenzi saw Zhou Changsheng's actions, his purple eyes widening as he roared, his gaze flickering. Finally, he gritted his teeth. "After this is over, you and I are not done!"

He still allowed Zhou Changsheng to proceed, not recalling the ancient pagoda. He swiftly pulled out a purplish-gold pill, which appeared incredibly precious. Even with Xuan Zhenzi's status, he showed a pained expression as he put the pill into his mouth, fearing he wouldn't have time to consume it later.

The Grim Reaper extended his hand, grasping his scythe, and transformed into a streaking light, moving forward. The Lord of Thunder's eyes bulged as he looked at Zhou Changsheng, who held the ancient pagoda. What kind of power was this, to be able to lift a Heavenly Venerable artifact with only physical strength?

The Holy God Lord's expression also changed drastically. It was now a critical moment for him to control the Pantheon; there could be no mistakes. This body could be sacrificed, but the Pantheon had to be within their grasp. But at this moment, all his concentration was on refining the Pantheon, leaving him unable to act.

"Agh!" Zhou Changsheng, holding the ancient pagoda, raised it high and swung it towards the Holy God Lord with immense force. The Grim Reaper and the Lord of Thunder were only a step away from him, but it was like an unbridgeable chasm.

Clang!

At the last moment, the Holy God Lord could only barely wield the Pantheon to block the attack. Xuan Zhenzi instantly fainted, his body almost splitting apart, but the purplish-gold pill in his mouth dissolved, and a cloud of purple qi enveloped him, barely sustaining his life. The Grand Dao roared here. The most primal collision between two Heavenly Venerable artifacts unleashed incredible power. Neither the Holy God Lord nor Zhou Changsheng had truly mastered the Heavenly Venerable artifacts in their hands, but even a mere physical collision between them was horrifyingly powerful, comparable to the collision of two small worlds!

Both instantly flew backward, and the Grim Reaper and the Lord of Thunder were also affected. Zhou Changsheng was caught by Wei Chuan's grandfather. A layer of faint golden runes circulated on his body—this was his last life-saving measure, refined by a Heavenly Venerable. Even so, his breath was faint, like a wisp of smoke. The hand that held the ancient pagoda had exploded, a bloody mess, and cracks covered various parts of his body. If not for the life-saving measure within him, he would have been killed by the counter-shock force immediately.

The Holy God Lord's expression was grim. A phantom image of his divine kingdom appeared behind him, almost solidifying, continuously pouring energy to maintain his host body from dissipating. In the recent collision, his host body had actually been damaged long ago, but he was maintaining it at all costs to refine the Pantheon. Even holy spirits within his divine kingdom were sacrificing themselves. The side of the Pantheon in his hand that was struck was slightly distorted. The main gate had been knocked open, and some divine thrones fell out—these were shaken loose by the shockwave from the two Heavenly Venerable artifacts.

Yan Mo's speed was not slow at all. Holding an ancient ruler, he strode forward fiercely and collected the scattered divine thrones. The Grim Reaper and the Lord of Thunder dared not advance. It wasn't that they feared death, but that they were wary of Yan Mo delivering an attack to the Holy God Lord just like Zhou Changsheng did.

The two sides were in a standoff, almost at their wits' end. Zhou Changsheng and Xuan Zhenzi had completely lost their combat strength, while Wei Chuan's grandfather and the powerful expert of light were already heavily injured and, after successive battles, lacked the strength to fight again. And although Yan Mo held the ancient ruler, appearing full of imposing aura, he was actually strong on the outside but weak within. The Holy God Lord also had no combat strength at this point; he was only forcibly holding on by relying on his divine kingdom, merely using his host body as a link to refine the Pantheon. He couldn't attack at all. The Grim Reaper and the Lord of Thunder, however, still had combat strength. But looking at Yan Mo's ancient ruler, it was difficult for them to gauge his true condition. After a series of unexpected events today, they now only wanted to quickly leave with the Pantheon.

"Go!" The Holy God Lord suddenly spoke. The Pantheon transformed into a streaking light and entered his forehead. With the help of the God-King's hidden trump card and special methods within the hall, he had finally refined the Pantheon. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to refine a half-step Heavenly Venerable artifact so simply, especially one that had fallen from the Heavenly Venerable rank.
