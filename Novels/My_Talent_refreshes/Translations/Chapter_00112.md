# Chapter 112: Golden Orchid Fruit

Standing in the spirit field, Chu Ning meticulously observed the two rows of Iron Stem Orchids closest to the Gold Origin Fruit. He finally confirmed his suspicion.

The Iron Stem Orchids in the row closest to the Gold Origin Fruit had fruits that were basically all tinged with golden yellow. In the row behind it, only a small portion had a similar golden-yellow hue. Further back, only a sporadic one or two plants showed this change. It was indeed highly probable that a hybrid mutation had occurred.

Upon reaching this conclusion, Chu Ning was momentarily unsure how to feel. In fact, when cultivating spirit plants, especially on a large scale, different spirit plants are often cultivated separately. These twenty mu of spirit fields were indeed separated from other spirit fields. However, within these twenty mu, they were not separated. Last season, Chu Ning had planted Gold Origin Fruit and Purple Crystal Bamboo, and the two spirit plants had no mutual influence. Chu Ning had overlooked this aspect for a while.

To be precise, it wasn't a complete oversight. Chu Ning was very clear about the cultivation methods for Gold Origin Fruit, and there was no mention of potential influence from Iron Orchid Fruit flowers. Chu Ning speculated that this was largely due to the fact that Iron Stem Orchids and Iron Orchid Fruits did not exist in the Green Gorge Mountains before. Thus, those who recorded the Green Stream Sect's archives were unaware that the two spirit fruits could affect each other.

Now, looking at these two rows of Iron Stem Orchids, Chu Ning's brows furrowed slightly, caught in a dilemma. If he kept them, he wasn't sure whether such a hybridization was good or bad. Could these Iron Orchid Fruits still grow normally? And after growing, could they still be used for body tempering? If he didn't keep them and destroyed them to replant, it would mean nearly two and a half months of effort wasted.

"Forget it, I'll take a gamble."

Gritting his teeth, Chu Ning decided to keep these Iron Orchid Fruits. Rather than wasting two and a half months, he might as well give it a try. If these mutated spirit fruits could eventually mature, then he would see what they would turn out to be. If they couldn't grow, at most, he'd waste another three months. Anyway, it was just two rows; the rest were basically normal.

With this thought, Chu Ning simply stopped worrying about whether these Iron Orchid Fruits were hybrid mutations and cultivated them according to normal methods. Subsequently, Chu Ning also began to experiment with these unusual Iron Orchid Fruits in various ways. After a series of attempts, Chu Ning discovered that these two rows of Iron Orchid Fruits absorbed spirit energy significantly faster. His Azurewood Spring Bloom Art, with a 30% increase in casting frequency, was still absorbed by them.

Chu Ning then discovered that this batch of Iron Orchid Fruits seemed to require more water. If he didn't cast the Sweet Rain Art for two days, the surface of the spirit fruits would appear somewhat shriveled. Chu Ning naturally wouldn't be stingy with his spells and increased the frequency of his casting accordingly.

What also pleasantly surprised Chu Ning was that ever since they bore fruit, these two rows of hybrid-mutated Iron Orchid Fruits grew noticeably faster than the normal ones. With his increased casting frequency, this batch of Iron Orchid Fruits was also half a size larger than the others. At the same time, as time passed, the brown skin of these Iron Orchid Fruits slowly faded, and the originally interspersed golden-yellow color began to deepen continuously. Following this trend, by the time they were fully ripe, the color of this batch of Golden Orchid Fruits would, in all likelihood, not be brown, but rather golden-yellow, just like the Gold Origin Fruits.

Two months later, in the spirit field.

Chu Ning held a jade box and began to pick the Gold Origin Fruits. The Gold Origin Fruits, after being picked once, seemed to shorten their regrowth time slightly. It took just over a month for a Gold Origin Fruit to be picked, then be re-stimulated to bloom. From blooming to fruiting, it now only took four months to ripen. Chu Ning naturally intended to sell all these Gold Origin Fruits to Gu Xiaohang. Due to the increasing number of late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators in the market, Gu Xiaohang had already started selling Spirit Essence Pills. The Gold Origin Fruit was also one of the important ingredients for Spirit Essence Pills. However, unlike Core Gathering Pills, the refining of Spirit Essence Pills required other more advanced materials.

At this moment, Chu Ning picked all the Gold Origin Fruits and stored them. Then he went to the rows of Iron Orchid Fruits and cast the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art. After finishing the spell, Chu Ning walked to the row closest to the Gold Origin Fruits.

"Can these still be called Iron Orchid Fruits? Or should I call them Golden Orchid Fruits?" Chu Ning chuckled, shaking his head as he looked at the two rows of now orange-yellow Iron Orchid Fruits. Then he sat down cross-legged and began cultivating the Azurewood Everlasting Spring Cultivation Method. These two rows of Iron Orchid Fruits absorbed spirit energy faster, so cultivating with the help of the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art also yielded better results. For the past two or three months, Chu Ning had basically been cultivating the Azurewood Everlasting Spring Cultivation Method in this spirit field.

After ending his cultivation, Chu Ning naturally glanced at his cultivation proficiency.
[Azurewood Everlasting Spring Cultivation Method (Yellow-rank Low-grade), Third Layer (500/2100)]
[Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Unbreaking Sinews (313/1500)]
[Soul Refining Art, First Layer (780/1000)]

"In about another month, I should reach the eighth level of Qi Condensation!" Chu Ning revealed a slight smile. It had been nearly five months since he entered the late-stage Qi Condensation. During these five months, Chu Ning spent the first month or so steadily cultivating with the help of the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art. After that, once he bought Spirit Essence Pills from the Wind Gorge Market, Chu Ning began to cultivate rapidly with their help. However, Chu Ning wasn't too reckless; after taking Spirit Essence Pills for a few days, he would usually pause for a bit and cultivate only with the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art and spirit stones. In the past few days, after all his Spirit Essence Pills were consumed, Chu Ning was not in a hurry to buy more elixirs. He felt that relying too much on elixirs for this stage of cultivation wasn't ideal, and it was good to cultivate steadily for a short period.

In fact, his progress was quite good. As of today, his proficiency in the third layer had reached 500. Based on Chu Ning's previous experience, breaking through 600 proficiency in the third layer should correspond to entering the eighth level of Qi Condensation. To advance from the eighth to the ninth level of Qi Condensation, he would need to add another 700 proficiency, breaking through 1300. As for adding another 800 proficiency to reach 2100, that should be the peak. If he wanted to continue cultivating, he would need to find subsequent cultivation methods.

However, Chu Ning also had a vague feeling that if his Azurewood Everlasting Spring Cultivation Method reached the complete third layer, the refreshed innate spiritual talent might be different, and it was very likely related to his next stage of cultivation. This had some reference, considering his previous cultivation of the Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art to perfection. It was precisely for this reason that Chu Ning wasn't far from the eighth level of Qi Condensation, yet he wasn't in a hurry regarding cultivation methods.

"I've stopped taking Spirit Essence Pills for a while; I can consider using them again, otherwise, I won't reach the eighth level of Qi Condensation in a month."

Chu Ning rose from the spirit field, placing Spirit Little White directly into his spirit beast pouch. Chu Ning surveyed his surroundings with his divine sense, and after confirming no one was present, he used the Illusionary Transformation Art to change his appearance. In recent months, there were still too many rogue cultivators and immortal cultivation families nearby. Chu Ning had to be cautious every time he changed his appearance. Furthermore, going to Gu Xiaohang to buy Spirit Essence Pills with his current displayed cultivation of the fifth level of Qi Condensation was not appropriate. He needed to change his identity.

With a completely new face, Chu Ning entered the market and headed straight for Gu Xiaohang's Spirit Pill shop. It wasn't a market day, and he wasn't sure if Gu Xiaohang would be open. He could only try his luck; if not, he would come another time.

To Chu Ning's slight surprise, not only was Gu Xiaohang there, but there was also someone else. Chu Ning knew this person; it was Du Han from the Enforcement Hall. The two were currently chatting about something, and Gu Xiaohang, facing outwards, had a look of distress on her face. Upon seeing the unfamiliar Chu Ning, she visibly let out a sigh of relief.

"Senior Brother Du, I have a customer. I should attend to them first." Gu Xiaohang said, then eagerly walked quickly towards Chu Ning. Her demeanor was such that if Chu Ning hadn't been certain his Illusionary Transformation Art was flawless, he would have suspected she recognized him.

"Alright, I'll wait for a bit." Du Han, with his back to the outside, now turned around and looked at Chu Ning, his brows slightly furrowed. He seemed very displeased by Chu Ning's appearance. Chu Ning felt a little baffled by this but quickly withdrew his gaze. He was currently in the identity of a seventh-level Qi Condensation rogue cultivator and didn't know Du Han.

"Fellow cultivator, what pills do you need?" Just then, Gu Xiaohang asked. Chu Ning quickly replied, "Do you have Spirit Essence Pills, fellow cultivator? Or other pills used by late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators?"

"Spirit Essence Pills? Yes." Gu Xiaohang replied quickly. "But I'll have to trouble fellow cultivator to wait a moment while I fetch them for you."

Chu Ning was slightly surprised. Shouldn't she have such pills in her storage bag? Of course, he didn't ask further, merely nodding. Gu Xiaohang then turned and walked inside. As she passed Du Han, Gu Xiaohang paused slightly and said with some apology, "Senior Brother Du, please head back for now. I need to get pills for my customer."

Du Han, however, smiled. "It's fine, Junior Sister. Go ahead and attend to your customer. I'll wait a bit." Gu Xiaohang didn't say anything more and hurried into the courtyard. She was gone for quite a while.

Only then did Gu Xiaohang re-emerge, holding a jade bottle, and came up to Chu Ning, apologizing, "Fellow cultivator, I apologize. I have too many pills, and this Spirit Essence Pill isn't commonly used recently, so it took me a while to find it."

Chu Ning could somewhat guess now that Gu Xiaohang was intentionally stalling for time. Connecting it with Du Han's visit, though he didn't know the specifics, he could guess a bit. Taking the pills from Gu Xiaohang, Chu Ning casually asked, "How many pills are in this bottle?"

"Ten pills."

Hearing Gu Xiaohang's reply, Chu Ning's brows furrowed slightly. His original intention was to buy thirty pills.

But Gu Xiaohang had hurried off earlier without asking. Gu Xiaohang had been observing Chu Ning's expression, and seeing him frown, she immediately asked, "Does fellow cultivator feel it's not enough? I can go get more."

Chu Ning nodded. "Yes, please get me two more bottles."

Upon hearing this, Gu Xiaohang's face lit up with joy. "Alright, fellow cultivator, please wait a moment while I fetch them for you."

Watching Gu Xiaohang's slow retreat, Chu Ning sighed inwardly. "Senior Sister Gu, this is all I can do to help you."

At this moment, Chu Ning keenly felt an unusually displeased gaze fall upon him. Without needing to think, Chu Ning knew it must be Du Han. He simply pretended not to notice, and took the pill bottle in his hand, opened it, and sniffed. Gu Xiaohang, perhaps knowing she couldn't stall any longer, didn't take long to re-emerge. She then casually handed Chu Ning two jade bottles together.

"Three bottles of Spirit Essence Pills, 600 low-grade spirit stones."

Chu Ning took them, then retrieved 600 spirit stones from a spare storage bag and placed them on the table in front of Gu Xiaohang. He had prepared extra storage bags ever since he bought the Illusionary Transformation Art in Wind Gorge Market. After opening the other two jade bottles and confirming there were no issues, Chu Ning put all the jade bottles into his storage bag. Then, he turned and left directly.

"Junior Sister Gu, about my proposal just now, I wonder what you think..." Chu Ning vaguely heard Du Han's words. Further on, he walked away, and could no longer hear anything.

Leaving the market, Chu Ning deliberately found an secluded spot, dispelled his Illusionary Transformation Art, and then slowly walked back to the market. To Chu Ning's slight surprise, Du Han was still at Gu Xiaohang's shop at this moment. However, Gu Xiaohang was now standing outside the shop. The two were still talking about something. Compared to before, Gu Xiaohang's face clearly showed more helplessness.

"Alas, a beauty can indeed cause trouble," Chu Ning muttered to himself. But what made Chu Ning a little curious was that Gu Xiaohang had been in the market for almost a year now. He had never seen Du Han show any interest in her before; why had he suddenly latched onto her today?

"Junior Brother Chu!"

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, Gu Xiaohang let out a surprised cry. Chu Ning's steps paused slightly, and he finally turned his head. He saw Gu Xiaohang quickly walking towards him.

Behind her, Du Han followed.

"Junior Brother Chu, you mentioned a couple of days ago that the Gold Origin Fruits could be harvested. Have you picked them yet? If not, let's go pick them now; I'm waiting here to refine pills."

"The Gold Origin Fruits were picked today," Chu Ning replied truthfully.

Upon hearing this, Gu Xiaohang immediately said, "That's wonderful! Let me take a look at Junior Brother's Gold Origin Fruits first." With that, Gu Xiaohang turned to Du Han and said, "Senior Brother Du, I need to go inventory the Gold Origin Fruits with Junior Brother Chu, so you..."

Du Han now seemed to finally be a bit impatient. He gave a soft "Mm," then said, "In that case, Junior Sister Gu, please reconsider my proposal. I'll come back another day." With that, Du Han turned and left. He didn't show any dissatisfaction towards Chu Ning. Clearly, Du Han also knew that Gu Xiaohang was just looking for an excuse to get rid of his entanglement, and there was no real relationship between her and Chu Ning. Moreover, Chu Ning's current cultivation of the fifth level of Qi Condensation was not something he or Gu Xiaohang would put much thought into.

Once Du Han left, Gu Xiaohang let out a soft breath, looking relieved. Having done all that, Gu Xiaohang turned and looked at Chu Ning. "Junior Brother Chu, let's go to your shop and see the Gold Origin Fruits."

Chu Ning, at this moment, pretended to be completely unaware of the situation. He just nodded, then took out his restriction token, opened his shop door, and welcomed Gu Xiaohang inside.

"Senior Sister Gu, these are one thousand Gold Origin Fruits. The quantity is the same as before." Chu Ning took out several jade boxes from his storage bag and opened them one by one, displaying them in front of Gu Xiaohang. Gu Xiaohang merely glanced at them generally, then collected all the boxes. Then, from her storage bag, she took out 1000 low-grade spirit stones and placed them in front of Chu Ning. Chu Ning separated 50 of them to the side, then smiled at Gu Xiaohang, "Senior Sister Gu, 950 spirit stones will be fine."

Gu Xiaohang nodded noncommittally, then took back the 50 spirit stones. However, she immediately seemed to realize her lapse and quickly offered Chu Ning an apologetic smile. "I'm so sorry, Junior Brother Chu, but Senior Brother Du has been bothering me all day, and I'm quite vexed."

"It's alright," Chu Ning said with an indifferent smile.

At this point, Gu Xiaohang seemed to have an urge to confide in someone, and she voluntarily spoke to Chu Ning: "Senior Brother Du has been stuck at the ninth level of Qi Condensation for some time, unable to enter the complete stage.

Recently, I don't know what happened, but he suddenly thought of breaking through with dual cultivation and wants me to be his Dao companion." As she said this, Gu Xiaohang's face turned slightly red.

Chu Ning then understood. No wonder Du Han had never shown this intention before, suddenly clinging to Gu Xiaohang now.

"I've made it very clear to him that I am single-mindedly pursuing the Dao and have no intention of seeking a Dao companion for now. But Senior Brother Du, sigh..." Gu Xiaohang's face was filled with sorrow.

This matter had nothing to do with Chu Ning, but thinking that Gu Xiaohang had been quite helpful to him during her year here, Chu Ning hesitated, then casually offered, "Senior Sister, why not find a good reason? For example, you once swore an oath not to seek a Dao companion until you reach the Foundation Establishment stage. If you break this oath now, it would affect your Dao heart, which would be truly detrimental to your future cultivation..."

Chu Ning stopped there, not saying more. Gu Xiaohang, listening, had eyes that suddenly became incredibly clear. "Why didn't I think of that?"

A gentle expression reappeared on her face, and Gu Xiaohang gave Chu Ning a bright smile. "Thank you, Junior Brother."

"You're welcome, Senior Sister."

Chu Ning watched Gu Xiaohang's hurrying departure and shook his head. If Gu Xiaohang said that, Du Han naturally wouldn't be able to pester her further. After all, affecting one's Dao heart was a profound and abstruse matter; even Du Han couldn't force it.

The street was deserted, so Chu Ning simply closed his shop door. Returning to his courtyard, he immediately consumed a Spirit Essence Pill and began cultivating.

For the next few days, Chu Ning continued his routine of farming, talisman crafting, and cultivating. He cultivated spirit plants while simultaneously improving his cultivation, striving to reach the eighth level of Qi Condensation as soon as possible.

Ten days later, the two mutated rows of Iron Orchid Fruits in the spirit field ripened first. Chu Ning simply named them "Golden Orchid Fruits" and harvested them one by one, placing them in jade boxes to bring back to the market. However, Chu Ning was still unsure of the Golden Orchid Fruits' specific use. He would need to explore how to use them.
