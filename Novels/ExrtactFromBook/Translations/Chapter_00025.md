# Chapter 25: Can't Finish It! There's Just Too Much!

The moose was massive in size, yet moved with astonishing speed! 

Its swinging antlers created terrifying sonic booms as it smashed through mountains and shattered boulders along its charging path.

Han Yue darted around the moose on golden light, nimble as a hummingbird, effortlessly evading every attack. With the moose's neck wound still gushing blood, Han Yue took his time. 

Periodically, he'd flash toward the beast on his golden radiance, slashing out blade energy to add fresh wounds. His [Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique] gave him speed far surpassing the moose's - not a single attack could touch him!

Instead, Han Yue began using the moose as target practice, honing his combat skills while familiarizing himself with the power of second-rank demonic beasts. As time passed, his coordination between golden light and blade energy grew increasingly fluid and lethal.

The golden light flickering through the air moved with graceful fluidity, like a dancing spirit. At every turn, a blade's edge might flash out - any opponent failing to guard would find themselves grievously wounded.

Before long, the moose was covered in wounds, its entire body dripping blood. At this rate, it wouldn't last much longer!

As a second-rank demonic beast, the moose wouldn't go down without a fight. Realizing it couldn't match Han Yue's speed, it retreated into a mountain hollow, pressing its back against the stone cliff to face its attacker. This halved Han Yue's angles of attack, forcing frontal assaults only.

Then, the moose exhaled a demonic wind from its nostrils, whipping up a storm of shattered stone and yellow sand toward Han Yue - its innate ability, [Wind Call]! 

The gale, infused with the moose's magic power, was devastating. It reduced visibility to zero while toppling trees and collapsing hillsides!

In the next instant— 

The golden light vanished!

Han Yue had simply... left!

The moose was stunned. What kind of shameless tactic was this? It had just mustered its full strength, and the opponent didn't even try to fight back—just fled?

Unable to sustain the magic expenditure indefinitely, the moose eventually ceased its windstorm. But the moment the gales stopped, the golden light returned, slashing blade energy across its nostrils!

Blood sprayed from the moose's nose and mouth, forcing it to unleash [Wind Call] again. Yet the golden light disappeared the instant it opened its mouth!

After several rounds of this cat-and-mouse game, the moose exhausted its magic reserves completely, unable to summon another gust.

Defenseless, it could only endure Han Yue's methodical blade strikes, each one chipping away at its life. 

After nearly a full day, the moose finally collapsed with a mournful cry, dead.

Final tally: the moose had attempted over five hundred counterattacks, used its innate ability seven times, suffered sixty-seven blade wounds (twenty-five fatal), dying a warrior's death.

Han Yue, meanwhile, had expended over half his magic reserves—a near-even match that could have ended in mutual destruction.

This battle marked Han Yue's first true victory against a second-rank demonic beast, representing a qualitative leap in his cultivation path.

Wrapping the moose's corpse in his storage, Han Yue rode his golden light back the way he came. Though his speed advantage had kept him safe from fatal blows, the prolonged battle's tension had left him mentally exhausted.

Streaking through the skies, the triumphant hunter's heart swelled with excitement!

Returning to Flesh Market, Han Yue went straight to the trading house's first floor to find the manager.

"Brother Blade! You've finally come!" The manager, who hadn't seen Han Yue in days, was practically weeping with anticipation.

Under the manager's eager gaze, Han Yue produced his corpse pouch and shook out an enormous moose carcass in the processing area.

"Is that...? Am I seeing correctly?"
"Gods! That's a huge deer!"
"Look at that blood aura—that's no first-rank beast!" The crowd buzzed with excitement.

"Brother Blade... you're selling a second-rank beast this time?" The manager's voice cracked with emotion.

"Got lucky with this big fellow. Have it appraised for me."

The manager immediately abandoned Han Yue to circle the moose twice before climbing onto its head to inspect its nostrils. Returning, he reported:

"Brother Blade, this is indeed a second-rank moose. I'd estimate it advanced less than ten years ago. With its [Wind Call] ability, its combat strength was considerable."

"Our house prices second-rank beasts in two tiers. First tier—initial stage second-ranks—fetch around five thousand trade coins. Second tier are peak second-ranks with nascent third-rank magic—minimum ten thousand coins."

"This moose qualifies for first tier—five thousand coins."

A single second-rank beast equaled twenty first-ranks in value! Though hunting them required more energy and time, Han Yue's earnings would more than double at this rate. Moreover, as his skills improved, he'd hunt them even faster.

After consideration, Han Yue said, "Please process the moose as usual, but I'll be keeping the lungs."

The manager responded promptly, "For your information, Brother Blade, the [Wind Call] ability stems from the lungs. They're the most valuable part. If you keep them, we can offer four thousand two hundred for the remainder. Acceptable?"

"Deal." Han Yue agreed.

"Excellent! Please rest while we prepare everything—it won't take long!"

The trading house's expert butchers made quick work of the carcass. Within minutes, the moose was quartered and the lungs delivered to Han Yue.

By now, the first floor was packed with spectators watching the second-rank beast being processed. Many were already negotiating with staff to purchase portions—second-rank flesh was always in short supply, and this moose would be gone quickly.

Returning to Courtyard Nine with the lungs, Han Yue found Xiao Liu waiting dejectedly at his door. The boy's face was pale, his voice hoarse with despair.

"Brother Blade... I failed. I couldn't absorb the energy." 

Han Yue just smiled, ruffled his hair, and led him inside before producing the massive lungs.

"Eat this, and you'll succeed for sure!" Han Yue declared, pointing at the organ taller than a man. "If this doesn't work, we'll find another way!"

Xiao Liu stared at the enormous lungs, utterly dumbfounded.

Can't finish it! There's just too much!
