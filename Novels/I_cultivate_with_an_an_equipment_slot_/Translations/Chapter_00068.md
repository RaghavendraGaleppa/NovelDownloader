# Chapter 68: Reward of a Third-Grade Spiritual Plant  

The "Old Lei" Mo Changqing mentioned was none other than the Peak Master of Thousand Treasures Peak—Lei Kunhai.  

He was one of the few Golden Core late-stage cultivators in the Qingheng Sect, and his profound mastery of artifact forging elevated his status within the sect.  

The grandson Lei Kunhai doted on was actually his great-grandson.  

His own sons and grandsons had either died of old age or perished in the frontier wars. Among his remaining descendants, this great-grandson was the only one with spiritual roots suitable for cultivation. Naturally, Lei Kunhai cherished him dearly.  

Moreover, his great-grandson possessed a high-grade spiritual root, making his cultivation talent quite decent.  

Now that his great-grandson had successfully reached Foundation Establishment, Lei Kunhai was preparing to pave the way for him to become the Seventh True Disciple of the Qingheng Sect.  

At this moment, if Zhang Yan sought to become a True Disciple, he would directly compete with Lei Kunhai’s great-grandson. Though Zhang Yan’s comprehension was exceptional, his opponent was a full major realm above him.  

Thus, their chances were roughly equal—each had their own strengths. The final decision would depend on the influence of their respective backers.  

Though Zhuge Wan was one of the seven Golden Core cultivators in the Qingheng Sect, she still fell short compared to Lei Kunhai.  

"Senior Brother, you’ll help me, won’t you?" Zhuge Wan gazed at Mo Changqing with a meaningful look.  

"Of course! What kind of question is that? In my heart, Zhang Yan is like my own disciple. Who else would I help if not him?" Mo Changqing wouldn’t violate sect rules for Zhuge Wan, but within the bounds of propriety, he naturally leaned toward Zhang Yan.  

After all…  

He might need Zhang Yan to support him in his old age someday!  

Moreover, as someone who had established his Foundation with multiple spells, Mo Changqing understood better than most the advantages of such a path.  

It wasn’t just about gaining additional divine abilities—his mana would also be denser and purer than that of ordinary cultivators.  

While some could achieve similar effects by using top-tier spiritual materials for Foundation Establishment, these couldn’t compare to the growth potential of divine abilities.  

"However, Junior Sister, we must convene an Elder Council for this matter," Mo Changqing said softly.  

"Indeed, Senior Brother is right." The position of True Disciple was of great importance, and the Elder Council couldn’t be bypassed.  

"There’s still time before the Elder Council convenes to decide on the True Disciple position and the secret realm quota. During this period, have Zhang Yan focus on cultivation. His comprehension is excellent, but his strength is still far too lacking."  

Mo Changqing rubbed his temples.  

Originally, with Zhang Yan’s comprehension, securing the True Disciple position should’ve been effortless.  

But alas…  

He only had a low-grade spiritual root.  

If he had even a mid-grade spiritual root, not only would the True Disciple position be his, but even the position of Sect Heir wouldn’t be out of the question.  

---  

After leaving Qingheng Peak, Zhuge Wan returned to Wood Spirit Peak and immediately summoned Zhang Yan.  

"Master."  

Zhang Yan bowed slightly.  

"I intend to secure the True Disciple position for you, but your cultivation is still too weak. You must cultivate diligently from now on."  

Zhuge Wan waved her hand and handed Zhang Yan several bottles of pills—all nourishing elixirs with no side effects.  

Though she was anxious about his progress, his future was paramount. If he took cultivation-boosting pills and accumulated pill toxins, even if he became a True Disciple, he could still be stripped of the title.  

"Thank you, Master! This disciple will not fail your expectations!"  

Looking at the pills in his hands, Zhang Yan couldn’t help but sigh.  

He had always said that if he didn’t buy them, someone would give them to him.  

And now, here they were—free pills!  

---  

"Alright, go and cultivate now." Zhuge Wan dismissed him with a wave.  

After leaving his master’s cave abode, Zhang Yan didn’t return to his own residence immediately.  

Instead, he headed straight for the Sect Master’s spiritual herb garden.  

After all, the Sect Master had said he could freely choose three spiritual plants!  

This time, he intended to maximize his gains.  

Heaven’s gifts, if refused, would bring misfortune.  

If Zhang Yan didn’t take them, the Sect Master might think he looked down on him!  

So he had to take them.  

This time, it wasn’t the same attendant who opened the garden for him.  

Instead…  

It was Mo Changqing himself.  

For some reason, when Zhang Yan saw the Sect Master this time, he noticed an odd expression on his face.  

Dressed in his Daoist robes, Mo Changqing reluctantly opened the garden gate, watching as Zhang Yan pounced on the treasures like a starving wolf entering a flock of sheep. He nearly tore his beard out in distress.  

These were spiritual plants he had painstakingly accumulated over many years!  

Though it was Zhang Yan’s second visit to Mo Changqing’s garden, he was still awestruck.  

And strangely, in just the few days since his last visit, it seemed like there were even more treasures inside!  

He really wanted to take everything!  

But glancing at Mo Changqing beside him, Zhang Yan dismissed the thought.  

His ambition was great, but his strength was lacking—no way could he win against the Sect Master.  

The most valuable treasures in Mo Changqing’s garden were at its heart.  

Zhang Yan ignored the outer plants and went straight for the core.  

At the very center of the garden was a clear spring.  

Its waters bubbled gently, exuding a rich spiritual energy.  

This was actually a spiritual spring!  

Within the spring, several emerald-green lotus leaves floated gracefully.  

These leaves were the most precious spiritual plants in the garden—a third-grade spiritual plant capable of directly benefiting Golden Core cultivators.  

Their value was beyond measure.  

Seeing Zhang Yan’s gaze fixated on the spring, Mo Changqing felt his breath hitch.  

These third-grade spiritual plants were his most prized possessions.  

"Is this the Serene Heart Lotus?" Zhang Yan frowned slightly before asking.  

"Indeed, it is." Mo Changqing nodded lightly, feigning indifference. "A third-grade spiritual plant. It bears lotus seeds every thirty years. The seeds can calm inner demons and enhance spiritual sense."  

"Enhances spiritual sense? Sect Master, you really have quite the collection!"  

Zhang Yan’s eyes lit up as he looked at Mo Changqing. Only now did he realize how deep his Sect Master’s reserves ran.  

Last time, he had taken a spiritual tea that boosted spiritual sense.  

Now, here was another treasure—the Serene Heart Lotus!  

"Sect Master, you once said I could freely choose three spiritual plants from your garden. Does that offer still stand?"  

Zhang Yan smiled as he asked.  

"Of course! My word is my bond!" Mo Changqing nearly gritted his teeth as he spoke.  

At the same time, he reminded himself inwardly: *Don’t be angry, don’t be angry. This is my dear junior sister’s disciple—practically my own disciple in all but name. Sooner or later, these treasures will be his anyway. It’s just a matter of timing!*  

"Good. In that case…" Zhang Yan pointed at the Serene Heart Lotus and declared, "I’ll take this one!"
