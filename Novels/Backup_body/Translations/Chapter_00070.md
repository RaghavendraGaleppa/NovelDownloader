# Chapter 70: A Brief Note on the Official Release!

The book officially launches at midnight tonight. After years of writing, I've come to realize that lengthy prefaces serve little purpose, and playing the sympathy card is even less appealing. The essence lies in the content itself, so unlike previous releases where I'd write thousands of words of introductory remarks, I'll channel that energy directly into the main text and focus on stockpiling more chapters.

For every 1,000 additional initial subscriptions, I'll add 10,000 words of new content!  
For every 1,000 additional monthly votes, another 10,000 words will be added!  

The extent of this release's word count explosion depends entirely on you, dear readers, to spur me onward!  

After all, as a diligent, hardworking, handsome, dashing, erudite, and extraordinarily talented (omitting ten thousand words here)... serious author, when it comes to bonus chapters—the sky's the limit!  

With this brief note delivered, I'm off to write!
