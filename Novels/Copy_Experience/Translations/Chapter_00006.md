# Chapter 6: The Difficulty of Foundation Establishment  

Lu Xun took out several talismans from his robe and enthusiastically introduced them:  

"I have Concealment Talismans, Fireball Talismans, Earth Spike Talismans... Each one is meticulously crafted."  

The young man listened attentively, took a few talismans from Lu Xun's hands, and examined them carefully before waving his hand decisively.  

"I'll take twenty for now. If the quality is as good as you say, I might purchase more from you in the future!"  

"Haha, rest assured, my friend. My talismans won't disappoint you!"  

Lu Xun was pleasantly surprised as he completed the transaction of twenty talismans with the young man named Xiao Hu.  

"Today went smoothly! Thirty talismans sold just like that!" Lu Xun thought to himself, feeling delighted.  

"Thank you for your kind words, Brother Gao!"  

He didn't forget to clasp his hands in gratitude toward the fish vendor nearby.  

"Haha, no problem at all! Fellow cultivators should help each other out!"  

The fish vendor waved his hand dismissively, his face beaming with a warm and friendly smile.  

"He seems like a helpful and enthusiastic cultivator," Lu Xun mused.  

The first two customers had set a good tone for the day. Over the next several hours, Lu Xun managed to sell another thirty talismans.  

"This is strange. All of them are regular customers, but their demand for talismans has suddenly increased. Has something happened?" Lu Xun couldn't help but feel suspicious.  

The next day, he set up his stall again, but luck wasn't on his side—he only sold ten talismans.  

The third day, the fourth day...  

It took him a full seven days to sell all one hundred and ten talismans.  

"One hundred and ten spirit stones! Hahaha! And it hasn't even been a year yet. Who would believe it?"  

Filled with excitement, Lu Xun wasted no time and immediately purchased nine hundred and sixty blank talisman papers.  

He planned to focus on talisman-making until the end of the year!  

After buying the papers, he still had ninety-three spirit stones left.  

As he returned to his courtyard, he was surprised to see a cart parked outside his gate. Several burly mortals were moving in and out, carrying furniture from inside.  

The Qinghu Market also had its share of mortals—some were from the Mo Family, while others were descendants of cultivators who performed menial tasks that cultivators avoided.  

"What's going on?"  

Lu Xun's eyes widened in surprise as he quickly walked past the cart and entered the courtyard.  

Inside, Leng Quan, dressed in a black martial outfit, stood in front of his small building, directing the mortals as they moved his belongings.  

"Brother Leng, are you moving out?" Lu Xun asked as he approached.  

Leng Quan nodded. "I'm planning to go into seclusion to break through to the fifth layer of Qi Refinement. I need a residence with richer spiritual energy."  

"Brother Leng, you're not even forty yet and already aiming for the fifth layer. You might have a chance at Foundation Establishment in the future!"  

At these words, Leng Quan's expression darkened slightly, and he shook his head.  

"I only have a lower-grade spiritual root. Reaching the late stages of Qi Refinement would already be an achievement. As for Foundation Establishment... *sigh*."  

The Qi Refinement stage was divided into ten layers: the first three were the early stage, layers four to six the middle stage, seven to nine the late stage, and the tenth layer was Qi Refinement Perfection.  

These divisions existed because cultivators often encountered bottlenecks at these thresholds.  

For example, He Qing and Old Man Xu were stuck at such a bottleneck. Both had poor aptitudes—it had taken them twenty to thirty years just to reach the third layer of Qi Refinement.  

Leng Quan seemed to be doing much better, now on the verge of reaching the fifth layer. If he survived his adventurous lifestyle, he might even reach the sixth layer.  

But beyond that, the bottleneck between the sixth and seventh layers would be extremely difficult for him to overcome due to his lower-grade spiritual root.  

Even if he succeeded, it would likely take a long time.  

And if he failed to reach Qi Refinement Perfection before the age of sixty, he would have no hope of achieving Foundation Establishment.  

In the cultivation world, it was said that if one did not establish their foundation before sixty, they would never succeed.  

The most basic requirement for Foundation Establishment was that a cultivator's essence, qi, and spirit must all be at their peak.  

Just as mortals' physical condition declined after twenty-five, cultivators' vitality began to wane after fifty. By sixty, they could no longer meet the minimum requirements for Foundation Establishment.  

"Brother Leng, don't be disheartened. Focus on the journey, not the destination. No matter the outcome, as long as you've tried your best, you haven't failed!"  

Lu Xun offered some encouraging words.  

He had spoken casually, but Leng Quan's eyes suddenly brightened.  

"Focus on the journey, not the destination... Well said, Brother Lu! That has always been my belief. Even if I never achieve Foundation Establishment, reaching this point with a lower-grade spiritual root is something to be proud of!"  

"Haha, who can predict the twists and turns of fate? Perhaps one day, Brother Leng will stumble upon a great opportunity and ascend to Foundation Establishment in a single step!"  

"Then I’ll take your auspicious words to heart!"  

Leng Quan clasped his hands in farewell. As the last piece of furniture was carried away, he strode out of the courtyard without looking back, embarking on his own path.  

---  

The small building stood empty, and the courtyard felt a little lonelier.  

"If I didn't have that stone tablet, I'd probably be walking the same path as him," Lu Xun sighed to himself.  

After a moment of contemplation, he turned and returned to his own quarters.  

Time passed slowly as Lu Xun settled into a monotonous routine.  

Talisman-making and farming—these two activities dominated his life, leaving no room for anything else.  

He even set aside cultivation entirely.  

This continued until the end of the year.  

"Xiao Lu, keep up the good work next year. I hope you can grow even more spirit rice!"  

Fatty Mo patted Lu Xun's shoulder with a meaty hand before taking his share of the rice—along with the portion he had skimmed off for the Mo Family—and flying away on his sword.  

Fatty Mo was quite satisfied with his comfortable life.  

And so was Lu Xun.  

After selling Fatty Mo a hundred catties of spirit rice for three spirit stones, Lu Xun took the remaining two hundred catties back to the market and sold them to his neighbors for five more spirit stones.  

This brought his total savings to one hundred and one spirit stones.  

But that wasn't all.  

The nine hundred and sixty blank talisman papers had been completely used up.  

Lu Xun now possessed two hundred and fifty first-grade low-tier talismans.  

"Once I sell these talismans, I'll take a break from crafting and focus entirely on cultivation!"  

"Cultivation is the foundation of everything!"  

With this decision made, Lu Xun set out for the market the next day.  

The fish vendor, Brother Gao, was still in his usual spot, a large fish tank placed in front of him.  

Hong Yuyu's stall remained empty.  

"It seems like I see him every time I come here," Lu Xun mused.  

Noticing his gaze, Gao Tianqiang turned and gave him a friendly smile.  

Lu Xun returned the smile with a nod before sitting down and waiting for customers.  

Unfortunately, luck wasn't on his side—after waiting for over three hours, not a single customer approached.  

With a sigh, he packed up and went home.  

The next day, he tried again, setting up his stall and waiting patiently.  

A few cultivators came by and bought seven or eight talismans.  

The third day was more fortunate—he sold over a dozen.  

On the fourth day...  

"You're selling talismans again, my friend!"  

Turning around, Lu Xun saw the young man called Xiao Hu, whom Gao Tianqiang had introduced before.  

"How were the talismans you bought last time? Were they satisfactory?"  

Lu Xun immediately smiled and stood up, clasping his hands in greeting. This was a big customer!  

"Not bad. The quality is decent. How many do you have this time?"  

"I've been diligently crafting talismans without pause, exhausting all my efforts. I’ve produced two hundred talismans, including Concealment Talismans, Fireball Talismans..."  

Before Lu Xun could finish, the young man waved his hand.  

"Two hundred? I'll take them all!"  

"Such deep pockets!" Lu Xun was impressed.  

"You're truly generous! Here are all the talismans."  

Lu Xun quickly handed over the talismans. After inspecting them, the young man tossed a bulging pouch to Lu Xun.  

Opening it, Lu Xun saw thumb-sized low-grade spirit stones inside. A quick count confirmed there were indeed two hundred.  

After taking the talismans, the young man exchanged a few words with Gao Tianqiang before leaving.  

Clutching the spirit stones, Lu Xun couldn't help but wonder:  

"Why would a fifth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator need so many talismans?"  

If he had money to burn, he could have bought mid-tier or even high-tier talismans instead of stocking up on low-tier ones.  

Such behavior was usually seen among those affiliated with factions.  

"Could he be a procurement officer for a small cultivation family?" Lu Xun speculated.  

Apart from the dominant Mo Family, the Qinghu Market housed several smaller cultivation families that relied on the Mo Family for survival.  

These families were typically at the Qi Refinement level, with only seven or eight, or at most a dozen, cultivators among them.  

For them, bulk purchases of talismans weren't unusual.  

"Ah, why should I care? I just need to focus on selling my talismans."  

"Still, I should be cautious around him. Knowing I have so many spirit stones, he might get greedy."  

Because of this wariness, Lu Xun hadn't disclosed the full extent of his stock, selling only a portion to the young man.  

He continued his sales over the next couple of days until all his talismans were gone.  

This brought his total wealth to three hundred and fifty-one spirit stones!  

"Damn, is this the kind of fortune a first-layer Qi Refinement cultivator should have? I need to boost my cultivation level fast!"
