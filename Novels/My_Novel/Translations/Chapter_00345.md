Chapter 345: No One Answers Her Cries, No One Hears Her Calls; The Sword-Breaking Madam Has Met Her Match

She was both furious and ashamed. She never imagined that her first great defeat in life would come in such a manner. She would have preferred to lose a sword duel or be defeated in a martial contest... anything but this kind of embarrassment, which was truly unbearable.

She could not speak, and she already knew that Li Xian's resolve to leave was absolute. She felt a creeping numbness in her scalp. "With this brat's cautious nature, he probably won't hurt me, and he might not even have the heart to, but he definitely won't let me go easily.落入 his hands, I'm really going to suffer."

She tried to break free from the sword intent, but her eyes suddenly widened in shock. Li Xian first followed the "Silk Garment" method of the "Silk Garment Jade Confusion Technique" and firmly wrapped Shen Cai'chang in the 'silk garment.' Knowing that she couldn't escape this capture method, he took another set of Green Silkworm Ropes and integrated the "Silk Garment Method" with the "Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword."

This was originally not an easy feat, but Li Xian had grasped the essence of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword, applying its moves flexibly and breaking free from the rigid framework of the sword style. Being naturally clever, after some research, he created a "Silk Sword Garment," which also served the purpose of binding, specifically targeting the vital points around the body to make movement difficult, yet it contained the principles of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword.

If this garment were worn by someone else, the principles of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword would be of little use, leaving only the binding capability. But for Shen Cai'chang, it plunged her deep into the quagmire of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword, silently combining the Yin and Yang swords. The sword intent circulated around her body, invisibly suppressing her cultivation, making it impossible for her to break free alone. Shen Cai'chang let out a mournful cry, thinking to herself, "This little bastard... he has endless tricks just for me. He actually came up with such a method, finding a unique way to neutralize my abilities. I... I'm so angry with him. He... he can't possibly have more tricks up his sleeve, can he?"

Seeing that he truly had a backup plan, Shen Cai'chang was so angry her head spun. "It's one thing for you to be so cautious with others, but you're not the least bit lenient with me either. You fear me like a tiger, yet you've used all your skills to capture a dragon."

She let out two muffled sounds, her beautiful eyes filled with killing intent as she glared at Li Xian twice. It was as if there was some cosmic retribution. In the past, Shen Cai'chang had used the Eight Ultimate Seals to trap Li Xian, making him "cut off from heaven and earth, cut off from water and fire."

Now, Li Xian had made her lie helplessly with her limbs in the air, making her cries to the heavens go unanswered and her calls to the earth go unheard, leaving her completely immobile. Shen Cai'chang was knowledgeable, but she couldn't solve her current predicament. She could only resign herself to Li Xian's arrangements.

She felt a strange sensation. She had always been proud, confident, and demanding of perfection, craving control. She was accustomed to mastering everything and arranging matters perfectly, insisting that everything go according to her will. If Li Xian had obeyed her, she would have meticulously planned what martial arts he would practice, what food he would eat, what miscellaneous skills he would learn... all to ensure complete control. Now, it was the complete opposite of her nature. Even her own limbs, which she was born with, were difficult to control, and her eloquent tongue was unable to speak. She had a faint feeling of this when practicing the "Silk Garment Jade Confusion Technique," but it was never as clear as it was now. The intense reversal left her at a loss, feeling extremely embarrassed.

The entire process took half a day. By the time noon had passed, the warm sun was high in the sky. Birds flapped their wings joyfully, and fish played in the water. The area around the lake was full of life. Li Xian had used all the skills he had learned in his life on this, and he felt exhausted. Seeing that Shen Cai'chang was completely restrained, he felt a hint of pride. "The Madam has been riding on my head, acting tyrannically for so long. It's about time I had a moment to hold my head high. A true man should be like this."

Shen Cai'chang's forehead broke out in a sweat, and she let out a soft breath. All she could do now was glare at Li Xian with her eyes. One wrong step leads to eternal regret; she never expected to have a day like this.

Li Xian said, "Madam, don't blame me. You used a giant cocoon to trap me last time. This time, we're even." Shen Cai'chang thought, "Ah, so he really did hold a grudge about that." She let out two "呜呜" sounds, feeling utterly helpless. She truly could do nothing to Li Xian now. She saw Li Xian's eyebrows slightly raised, clearly extremely proud, and secretly regretted not having bullied and pricked him more in the past.

Li Xian thought, "The Madam always wants to capture me and take me back. Now I've turned the tables and captured her. Judging by her appearance, she should be in a bind and unable to escape. Why can't I take the Madam away?" This thought suddenly occurred to him, and his mind became agitated.

But he calmed down and thought again, "I'm afraid it's not that simple. The reason I can trap the Madam now is entirely due to the功劳 of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword and the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword. I have the advantage of timing, terrain, and support, while the Madam is only barely trapped. This sword intent will eventually dissipate. The Madam is knowledgeable and has vast abilities; she might be able to break free quietly? By then, I'd be in deep trouble. I'll consider capturing the Madam only when I truly have the ability to defeat her in the future."

"By then, if the Madam dares to act arrogant again, I'll spank her butt and give her a good lesson. Hahaha, that would truly be a display of my masculine might and high spirits."

He couldn't help but smile, feeling a pleasant breeze on his face and a great sense of pleasure. This scene was caught by Shen Cai'chang, who couldn't help but glare at him, guessing that Li Xian was laughing at her pathetic state, and felt an immense sense of indignation. She didn't know that even though she was in a pathetic state now, her charm was still exceptional.

Li Xian said, "Madam, please wait a moment." He turned and left, walking through the forest with the Seven Star Steps. This was deep in the dense forest, with few paths around. The weeds grew in a mess, and the snow was piled up thickly. Sometimes, if he stepped into empty space, his foot would sink deep into the snow and into a pile of rotten leaves. The cold air stored in the pile of rotten grass and leaves could freeze a foot in an instant, making walking very difficult. Li Xian ran to a secluded path and saw a carriage and a white horse.

A few days ago, Li Xian and Shen Cai'chang had arrived by carriage. They had been so focused on practicing their swords that they had forgotten everything else and had neglected these items. The white horse was so hungry it was drowsy, lying on its side in the grass.

Li Xian checked its breath and found it was still alive. He immediately sent his internal energy into it to warm its body. The white horse gradually regained its breath, but after several days without food or water, it had no strength to get up.

Li Xian said, "Wait a moment." He looked around and saw a small stream to the east. He also saw a green tree nearby with large leaves that had not fallen. He slapped the tree trunk, scattering the leaves. Then, using the "Pure Yang Energy Garment," he caught the leaves in mid-air and quickly walked to the stream.

He used the "Cloud-Catching Mist" move from the "Cloud-Piercing Hand," his palm grabbing and pulling in the water. The water, as if it were a solid object, was easily "picked up." Li Xian used the leaves to hold the water and threw it to the white horse.

Li Xian repeated the process, continuously using the Cloud-Piercing Hand to fetch water and throwing leaffuls of water. After getting some water, the white horse regained a bit of its breath, but it was still extremely weak. Li Xian knew it was starving, and just drinking water was useless, so he tried to find some dry grass to feed it.

Only then did the white horse recover its vitality. Li Xian unhitched the carriage, led the white horse, and tied it to a tree. He gently patted its back and said, "You just wait here and behave."

Although the white horse was just an ordinary horse, it was very intelligent and nodded its head. It stayed老实 under the tree. Li Xian jumped onto the carriage. It was spacious and warm inside, with the lingering fragrance of Shen Cai'chang's hair and body.

There was an incense burner inside, but the fire had gone out. Under the table, there was a supply of incense charcoal, shaped like square jade, a light yellow color. When burned, it was warm and moist, not dry or harsh, with a faint, pleasant fragrance. The tables, chairs, and bed curtains... the specifications were very high. The bed was covered with a layer of snow beast fur, which still retained a bit of warmth. The Madam had lain on this fur blanket when she rode in the carriage. Li Xian thought, "The Madam is very good at enjoying life. Anything that belongs to her is bound to be good. Come to think of it, I've never really explored her carriage. I have a beehive and an orchard in my water gourd, and I'm a person of some stature now, so I also have a carriage when I travel. But my carriage is very simple, bumpy on the road, and the space is cramped. I always thought that you get what you pay for, and this carriage is indeed exceptional."

"This kind of carriage deserves a good look. In the future, when I have enough money and settle down to build a manor, my travel gear should also be presentable."

For a martial artist, travel gear is a matter of face. The carriage trade is a deep and complicated business. Li Xian had been in the Jianghu for some time, and this path was becoming clearer to him. He knew how to judge a person by their possessions. He carefully examined the carriage's interior and found a hidden compartment on each side. He pried one open and found two precious swords, one blunt and one sharp, which were given as a bonus when the carriage was purchased.

The carriage business has all sorts of tricks; they often hide precious or famous swords in the carriage. Buyers who pry open the hidden compartments might find a pleasant surprise. There was once a martial arts master who bet his entire fortune on a luxury carriage and opened it to find a famous sword. Riding on the prestige of the famous sword, he carved out a territory for himself.

These were the "Mother and Son Blunt Swords," which had a small reputation. The mother sword was blunt, symbolizing tolerance. The son sword was sharp, symbolizing aggression. With both swords in hand, the sword techniques become unpredictable and flexible. Li Xian took out the two swords, and their bodies lightly touched, making a "ding" sound.

The surrounding trees "rustled" and shook. Li Xian marveled, "Good sword! Good sword!" The sound made by the two swords colliding subtly matched the wonderful effect of the "Ethereal Immortal Melody." It made the trees shake continuously. If one were to practice a corresponding sword style, one could uncover many more wonderful uses.

Li Xian sighed, "It's a pity I already have the 'Sinking River Sword' and the 'Green Sword.' With two more swords, I wouldn't be able to hide them on my body." So he put the two swords back in the hidden compartment.

There was a bookshelf in the carriage, filled with miscellaneous books. There were "Records of Flying Dragon City," "Map of the Cold Snow Mountains," "Traveler's Miscellaneous Accounts," "Notes on Snow Grass"... Every time Shen Cai'chang arrived in a new place, to buy land or run business, she would study the local area thoroughly. She would plan before acting, which was very steady and shrewd.

As he was flipping through them, he found a roll of "Green Silkworm Ropes" inside the bookshelf. Li Xian took it along with him, thinking of the Madam's angry gaze, and instead of being afraid, he felt curious. He thought, "It's useless just lying here, so I might as well take it for the Madam again and make the best use of it."

He closed the carriage window and went down to the carriage. He tried to lift the carriage on his back and head towards the snow lake. The carriage was made of 'Iron-Sinking Wood' and was very heavy. With each step, his foot sank deep into the snow. Li Xian carried the carriage on his shoulder and ran quickly for more than ten miles, feeling a little tired. Afraid that the Madam would freeze for too long, he carried the carriage and ran as fast as he could, all the way back to the snow lake. It took him about an hour.

He saw the dignified Sword-Breaking Madam, Shen Cai'chang, being pestered by birds and beasts. The animals, taking advantage of her helplessness, chirped and circled around her. Shen Cai'chang was extremely angry. Her hands and feet were bent back and connected, with no place to exert force. She desperately twisted her body, lying on her side in the grass, feeling for stones with her fingers on the ground. It was hard to find one, but she immediately shot it out, knocking down a bird.

But she was already drenched in sweat, having exhausted all her strength. Li Xian drove away the flock of birds and brushed the stray snow off Shen Cai'chang's body. Shen Cai'chang's beautiful eyes were filled with grievance as she glared at Li Xian twice. At this moment, she was helpless and delicate. Even with her naturally ruthless nature, it was all hidden away.

Shen Cai'chang caught a glimpse of the carriage and thought, "This little bastard went to carry the carriage. This carriage is very heavy and sturdy, but he has the strength to waste on such things." Her body was lifted, and she felt the warmth of his embrace, which made her heart stir.

There was a carriage but no horse. Li Xian carried Shen Cai'chang into the carriage and immediately felt the warmth. He gently laid her on the snow fur blanket and blew a breath of pure energy to clean the snow and dirt off her. Shen Cai'chang glared at him in displeasure. "This brat has arranged everything for me perfectly. He must have been plotting and planning against me for a long time. Sigh... it's not unjust that I've fallen into his hands."

Li Xian took out the yellow jade incense charcoal, lit it, and put it in the incense burner. A warm heat slowly permeated the air, quiet and leisurely, making it quite comfortable for a moment. Li Xian then rummaged out another Green Silkworm Rope. Shen Cai'chang's heart skipped a beat. "He must have rummaged through my carriage and found the Green Silkworm Ropes I usually practice with. With his nature, he'll naturally use them on me again." A dark line appeared over her head, and she quickly shook her head to beg for mercy.

After Li Xian finished wrapping her in the silk garment again, he saw that Shen Cai'chang's long hair was like a waterfall, scattered all over her body. He helped her coil it up and fix it with a golden hairpin, making her look more dignified. He covered her with a layer of bedding, hiding all her embarrassment.

Shen Cai'chang gave Li Xian a look and cursed inwardly, "At least he has a little conscience." She closed her eyes and calmed her breathing. This series of treatments left her overwhelmed. She really couldn't have predicted that the Five Swords Agreement would end like this.

Li Xian pulled out three strands of his hair, planted one outside the carriage and two inside. The hair took root upon touching the ground and could transmit sensations, acting as eyes and ears, giving him full control of the situation inside and out.

Li Xian thought, "This way, it'll be foolproof. The Madam can't move. If I don't take some measures and just leave her here, it would still be improper." He closed his eyes and sensed, the situation inside and outside the carriage appearing in his mind.

The hair had excellent hearing but poor eyesight. But after being tempered by the "Five Organs Expelling Turbid Yang Meridian," its eyesight had gradually improved and could now distinguish figures and movements. Li Xian asked, "Madam, are you hungry?"

Shen Cai'chang kept her eyes closed and ignored him, thinking to herself that she was so angry with him she was dizzy, how could she eat anything else. But fighting against the Five Mountain Sword Alliance together and practicing swords in the lake for several days had indeed consumed a great deal of her strength, internal energy, and energy. Now, the carriage was warm. Although she was in a trap, there was no immediate danger to her life, and instead, she gradually felt a sense of comfort. Even if there were danger, Li Xian would surely挡 it first. Her appetite was whetted.

Li Xian smiled. "I guess you are. I'm also very hungry. Madam, wait a moment, I'll go into the city to buy some food." He ran out of the carriage. Shen Cai'chang let out two "呜呜" sounds, and then saw the carriage door close, leaving it quiet and still.

It was now past dusk, and the sky was dark. The birds and beasts in the forest were all asleep, and a faint white moon shone on the lake like a mirror. Shen Cai'chang was extremely闷气 and bored. She let out a long sigh. Resisting was useless, so she could only endure it and take the opportunity to practice the "Silk Garment Jade Confusion Technique."

After a while, she opened her eyes with a grievance. At this very moment, the Silk Garment Jade Confusion Technique was progressing surprisingly fast.

Li Xian found the white horse and rode it back to the city. Flying Dragon City was as bustling as ever, with no curfew. In the distance, tall buildings were adorned with red lanterns and carved beams and painted rafters, with people coming and going. The streets were lined with dense shops, lively and crowded, with the fragrance of food wafting through the air. Street vendors were calling out to sell their goods non-stop.

Li Xian thought, "The Madam is used to eating delicacies of mountains and seas. It should be fine for her to have some street food occasionally. Come to think of it... I've been in Flying Dragon City for a long time, and one thing has followed another. I haven't really strolled through the city streets and alleys properly. Now that everything is settled, I should take a good stroll before I leave. It wouldn't be a wasted trip."

He dismounted and led the horse for a stroll. First, he found an inn nearby, bought some hay to feed the white horse full, and left the horse at the inn.

He walked through the streets and alleys, seeing roadside performances, acrobatics, and iron flower spraying... Flying Dragon City was in a relatively remote location, already on the edge of the Great Wu's territory. Further northwest, there were endless white snow and continuous snowy mountains, extremely cold and treacherous, a natural barrier that was very difficult to cross.

He Wentiian controlled such a terrain. If he had the help of the Five Mountain Sword Alliance and the Nine-Orifice Dragon Heart Corpse Soldiers, he would have the opportunity to carve out a kingdom for himself. Unfortunately, he was too hasty and too ambitious, leading to his downfall and eternal regret, with all his plans coming to nothing.

Li Xian saw that Flying Dragon City had the custom of eating "hot pot." He got a hot pot, added charcoal fire underneath, poured water into the pot, and once the water boiled, he gradually added ingredients. Eating while it was hot was extremely enjoyable. When the snow is falling heavily, it's so satisfying to get together with friends inside, drink and eat meat, and warm oneself by the charcoal fire.

"There was similar food in my previous life, just with a different name. Although the snow and wind aren't heavy now, it's just right."

Li Xian bought his ingredients. He bought horse meat, wild boar meat, civet cat meat... each with its own flavor. Then he strolled along the road, observing the street food. If he was interested, he would wave his hand and buy two portions with great generosity.

By the snow lake, all was quiet and still. Shen Cai'chang lay on the bed. Although she occasionally struggled, she couldn't break free. Ever since Li Xian had arrived in Flying Dragon City, he had a faint feeling that danger followed him. Now, the many mysteries and difficulties had all been thoroughly resolved. His mood was carefree and leisurely, and only now did he have the time to tour the city.

He saw a street vendor selling candied haws. The bright red sugar coating wrapped around round fruit pulp. Li Xian's appetite was greatly stimulated, so he bought a string. The sugar coating was crisp and sweet, the fruit pulp fragrant. The taste was quite good. So he bought two more strings and wrapped them in oil paper.

Li Xian bought things along the way. As he passed the "Green Fragrance Pavilion," he frowned. He sneaked into the pavilion and saw the maid, Xiao Tuan, with her hands on her hips, directing dozens of staff to clean the courtyard.

Xiao Tuan was holding a branch, her face looking fierce. But she was still young and innocent, so she didn't have any real ferocity. She deliberately imitated Shen Cai'chang's tone of voice, but it was a bit forced.

She shouted, "Hurry up! If anyone slacks off, I'll hit their palms with this branch! Don't look at me for being small, hehe, if anyone takes a hit, the feeling will be so painful they won't be able to make a sound."

She had seen Shen Cai'chang use the Heart-Aching Sword to stab Li Xian's palm, as if she were hitting his palm. She learned from her example and used it to establish her authority. But she waved the branch around without actually hitting the staff. Instead, she earned a 'reputation for benevolence.' When she raised her arm and shouted, all the staff rushed to take orders from her.

Li Xian pondered, "This Xiao Tuan seems quite clever, and her temperament is much better than Qiu Yue's. At least, that's what I see now. The Madam is bound by me, and it's not a solution to keep this stalemate forever. I'll need her help later. But there's no rush. The Madam's cultivation is very high. When I practice the sword with her, borrowing her cultivation to evolve the sword techniques, and with the Yin-Yang principles involved in the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword, the sword intent can last for a very long time. I estimate that even with the Madam's abilities, she won't be able to do anything for the next ten days or so. That gives me time to get everything in order."

He crossed the secret door of the Green Fragrance Pavilion. Just as he was about to leave the city, he suddenly heard a passerby say, "Hurry, hurry, or we'll miss it if we're late!" "Yes, it's a rare Flying Dragon Festival, and the City Lord is hosting it in person. He is so generous and benevolent. If it weren't for him, how could we have such good days?" "In previous years, the festival was organized by the Worry-Free Tower. This year, the Worry-Free Tower suddenly collapsed, so we had to change the location." "What a pity. Lord He loves his people like his own children. How could he have encountered such a tragedy? A perfectly good tower, how could it just collapse?"

Li Xian thought to himself upon hearing this, "He Wentiian is indeed insidious and cunning, but even if it's an act, he really has managed the people of this place well and is loved by them. I haven't heard any news about him since I came out of the tomb. I wonder what happened to him later."

The crowd gathered towards a venue. It turned out that today was the seventh day of the second month, the Flying Dragon Festival. The streets were extremely lively, and the flow of people was like a river.

Li Xian followed the crowd towards the festival. After waiting for half an incense stick's time, He Wentiian appeared in public to celebrate with the people, and the atmosphere became extremely hot. He Wentiian wore a red robe, his face full of smiles, and spoke only words of celebration.

Li Xian focused his gaze and saw that He Wentiian was completely unharmed. He was inwardly amazed. "Could it be that the Five Mountain Sword Alliance just let He Wentiian go like that? The Five Mountain Sword Alliance prides itself on being a famous orthodox sword sect, but He Wentiian captured their female relatives, secretly harmed them several times, and finally surrounded and killed them with a heavy force. The Five Mountain Sword Alliance couldn't be so merciful as to pretend nothing happened."

Li Xian felt it was strange. "Now the Five Mountain Sword Sects have all left the city. Well... I'll go and investigate. But if it really is He Wentiian, I'm definitely no match for him, so I should hide my figure well. The Madam is tied up now. If I cause trouble, it won't be easy to handle." He was extremely vigilant, shrinking his body and hiding in the crowd. His eyesight was extremely strong, locking onto He Wentiian's figure. Even amidst the chaotic flow of people, he could always perceive his movements.

He Wentiian was as comfortable as a spring breeze, treating people with a gentle and refined manner, showing a noble air. He walked away with a stately gait, surrounded by city guards for protection. Li Xian couldn't get close for the moment. He observed the surrounding buildings and found a "Flying Dragon Tower," which was very tall and had a wide view. He kept an eye on He Wentiian while sneaking into the Flying Dragon Tower and climbing to a higher place to observe with his eyesight.

He saw He Wentiian get into a sedan chair and head towards the west of the city. Li Xian thought, "There are many city guards patrolling the streets and alleys. If I use my lightness skill, I'll be detected immediately. It would be extremely bad if my figure is exposed then. I'll first remember his direction, predict his location, run quietly to the nearby area, and then climb to a high place to look for him. This way, I can observe his movements while always hiding myself."

He opened his heavy pupils, and his eyesight increased dramatically. He raised his eyebrows and looked, and many details came into view. There were many pedestrians in the city, and the carriages moved very slowly. The carriage was entirely green and decorated luxuriously, making it quite conspicuous. Li Xian predicted a location and arrived there first. On the way, he used the "Cloud-Piercing Hand" to snatch a Jianghu traveler's bamboo hat.

When he arrived at the location early, he climbed to the top of a tall building and looked down at the streets and alleys from a high place. With his heavy pupils' powerful eyesight, he could find He Wentiian's tracks. He saw the carriage turning left and right, and it actually arrived at a government office. He Wentiian flicked his sleeve and got out of the carriage. The runners of the government office quickly came to greet him.

Li Xian secretly said, "Could it be that this He Wentiian is really so diligent that he's still handling civil affairs late at night?" He used his heavy pupils to see through the walls of the government office and saw a familiar figure. It was Han Qingxiao, whom he had met by chance at the Worry-Free Tower in the past. Li Xian felt extremely strange and couldn't figure out the reason for a moment.

He observed for a while longer, and Lin Aoshan came out of the hall. She was smiling brightly and her steps were lively, not at all like seeing an enemy. He Wentiian's expression was solemn as he whispered something to Han Qingxiao and Lin Aoshan. Lin Aoshan and Han Qingxiao's expressions suddenly sank, and they looked left and right, extremely vigilant.

Li Xian pondered, "Could it be that my secret observation, which I thought was flawless, has already been detected? The Madam had this ability in the past, being very sensitive to gazes. It's not surprising that He Wentiian detected it. I'm hiding very far away, so even if he detects me, he can't do anything to me. But this He Wentiian is extremely strange. Logically, if he knows he's being tracked, he should dispatch the city guards to search, not discuss matters with Han Qingxiao."

Han Qingxiao shouted from afar, "I am Han Qingxiao of the Celestial Patrol Division of the Great Wu Dynasty. Senior, for secretly following us, it is beneath your dignity. If it is possible, please come out and meet us!" As he spoke, he secretly activated the Ethereal Immortal Melody within him. Ordinary mortals cannot hear the Ethereal Immortal Melody. This shout could only be heard by those with martial arts cultivation.
