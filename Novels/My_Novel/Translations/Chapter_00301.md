# Chapter 301: The Mistress Wields Her Power, the Green Snake Suffers; There Are Always Greater Heights, Desiring Precious Treasures

Li Xian chanced upon the Ghost Python Spear. The shaft was heavy, a rare and formidable weapon. He executed the 'Ghost Spearplay of the Remnant Specters,' unleashing moves like 'Gale-Whipped Tough Grass,' 'Remnant Specter Playing in Water,' 'Weary Human Shadow,' and 'Withered Crow Defeating the Moon.' His prowess surged by several degrees. Moreover, the Ghost Python Spear contained a profound 'Ghost Python Spirit,' its shaft heavy and sturdy yet flexible and versatile.

His spirits soared, and he danced wildly within the courtyard. His progress in the martial path was faster than usual. He recalled the 'Four Great Rankings,' which included the 'Divine Weapons Ranking.' It recorded special armaments; obtaining any one of them would drastically increase one's strength. Furthermore, the emergence of a divine weapon would inevitably draw the contention of all sides.

Li Xian thought, "The grand era of martial arts is infinitely splendid. Whenever I make some progress and feel complacent, I think of the vast world and realize I am but a drop in the ocean, insignificant. This only spurs me to practice even harder. One day, even if the world is vast, there will be a place for me."

[You have digested the essence of heaven and earth, Proficiency +1]

Li Xian had consumed the flesh of the precious creature. Through the reinforcement of consumption, circulating his qi through the meridians, and suppressing his blood to retain nearly half, he had already digested eighty percent of it. Twenty-three strands of heaven and earth essence remained.

To advance further in the martial path, he needed more heaven and earth essence and the flesh of precious creatures. Li Xian thought, "I still have a portion of the Yellow Nine Ginseng. If I can find the Morning Yellow Dew, I can trade the ginseng for it. Then I can obtain the 'Golden Light' technique. I need to find a way to inquire about this."

Hao Qing's brows furrowed slightly as she found a seat, her gaze secretly sizing things up. She thought, "Since leaving the Water Altar, I have offended many people. This woman's appearance and temperament are exceptional. She sits alone in the hall, with neither wine nor food, nor porridge or rice. She doesn't seem like a guest at an inn. She must be waiting for someone, perhaps also here to kill me. A beautiful woman like this, a venomous vessel, is hard to come by. She doesn't know her own limits, yet dares to come for me." Thinking of this, she felt a hint of amusement and disdain, settling down calmly.

The woman sipping tea and waiting was naturally Wen Caishang. The young girl was named 'Xiao Tuan'.

It turned out that back at the Water Altar island, when Hao Qing's Snake and Li Xian exchanged palms, Li Xian knew that a heavy blow would mean certain death, while a light one would result in severe injury for a long time. Before striking his palm, he抽出了几缕蚕丝 (pulled out several strands of silkworm thread) and sent them into Hao Qing's hair with his palm wind.

The silkworm threads were made of a special material. Blended into the hair, they were extremely difficult to detect. Even though Hao Qing's cultivation was not weak, she couldn't sense them. After she left the Water Altar and stirred up trouble outside, it wasn't long before Wen Caishang noticed her.

Wen Caishang said softly, "I have long heard that the Candle Cult's Envoy, Green Snake, is exceptionally skilled in poison and very powerful. It is a great honor for Caishang to meet you today. If the Envoy doesn't mind, please come and sit closer."

Hao Qing's pupils contracted slightly. She was eccentric and domineering, but she rarely flaunted the 'Candle Cult' name. To have her identity seen through at a glance, how could she not be shocked. She sneered, "Then may I ask who you are? Knowing my title, you still dare to invite me closer. Is it that you don't know the immensity of heaven and earth, or are you supremely confident?"

Wen Caishang gently rolled up her sleeve and put down her teacup. She said, "Caishang is just an ordinary person, not worth mentioning. Neither do I know the immensity of heaven and earth, nor am I supremely confident. I met you by chance at the inn and felt curious. I have a few questions to ask. Please come and sit." As soon as she finished speaking, the surrounding tables and chairs suddenly made several 'cracking' sounds and all fell apart. Only Wen Caishang's table and chair remained intact.

Hao Qing's face showed shock. She leaped from her seat, looking at Wen Caishang with suspicion, completely unaware of how it was done. She had always been eccentric, how could she tolerate being threatened. She was about to retaliate when she suddenly felt her clothes were entangled with countless invisible silkworm threads, crisscrossing in an infinitely complex pattern. If she tried to resist, the numerous threads would be like sharp blades, instantly flaying her alive.

Since she began practicing martial arts, she had never encountered such a strange situation. She had no idea how the silkworm threads were laid out, and cold sweat streamed down her back. Although her methods were profound, in this situation, she felt a bit of fear. The power displayed at the first meeting was already so terrifying. Even if she could counter this move, she would likely be unable to handle the subsequent, more powerful techniques. Her temperament was eccentric, her actions dictated by whim, and she was notoriously unpredictable, making her very difficult to talk to. But in this situation...

She naturally became reasonable, gentle, and even-tempered.

Hao Qing said solemnly, "Your methods are impressive. Did you lay an ambush for me long ago? If you came for my life, why waste so many words?"

Wen Caishang said, "Envoy Green Snake, this young girl only invited you for a drink and a chat. Why be so agitated?" Two teacups were already placed on her table. One had touched her red lips, the other was still empty.

Xiao Tuan poured tea into the other cup. Wen Caishang picked it up with her slender fingers and gently pushed it towards Hao Qing. The teacup flew across and stopped right in front of Hao Qing's nose. The hot steam of the tea brushed against her cheeks. She suddenly felt her cheeks burning. The tea in the cup was boiling and evaporating, the cup wall trembling slightly, as if containing a hint of celestial music.

The evaporating tea enveloped her face, causing a burning pain. Hao Qing focused her gaze and saw that although the cup seemed to be suspended in mid-air, there was actually a silkworm thread supporting it from the bottom. This thread continued to extend, stopping just a hair's breadth from her neck.

She swallowed hard. Her hand trembled slightly as she picked up the cup. The tea was scalding hot, containing potent internal qi. The cup wall vibrated, containing a lingering celestial melody. This cup of tea was itself an extremely powerful martial art.

An ordinary person would be severely injured just by drinking it. Hao Qing's hand trembled as she brought the cup to her lips and drank it in one gulp. The tea fragrance was long-lasting. As the tea entered her stomach, blood rushed to her chest.

She suppressed it forcefully, pretending to be calm. In reality, she had already suffered a significant injury, deeply feeling that this woman's martial arts attainment was terrifyingly high.

Wen Caishang smiled softly and said, "Please, take a seat." Her gentle voice carried an undeniable authority.

Hao Qing's face twitched. She focused her gaze and looked around her body. The fine, crisscrossing silkworm threads parted to make a path. She walked to the opposite side of Wen Caishang and sat down helplessly, placing the teacup on the table.

Her movements were extremely light.

Wen Caishang took the teapot, rolled up her sleeves, and poured tea for Hao Qing. She said, "This is the 'Panlong Tea' I brought specially. Its fragrance is long-lasting. It needs to be sipped slowly to appreciate its subtleties. Unfortunately, this little girl is clumsy, her tea-making skills are拙劣 (crude), ruining such good tea."

Xiao Tuan gave an embarrassed smile. Wen Caishang said gently, "You... you dare to laugh? I've been too lenient with you." Her eyes showed a strange glint.

Wen Caishang put down the teapot and gently pinched Hao Qing's chin with her slender fingers, applying a bit of force. Hao Qing had to tilt her head back, allowing Wen Caishang to scrutinize her. She felt extremely humiliated, but how could she dare to say a word.

The other disciples of the poison sect present were unaware of the situation. They only saw their usually arrogant master becoming utterly submissive.

Wen Caishang sighed softly, "Your eyes are charming, your looks are not bad." Her eyes filled with resentment.

Hao Qing felt a great sense of humiliation. At this moment, even if she wanted to fight to the death, her entire body's internal qi had been suppressed. The ferocity and recklessness she had shown towards Shi Fei were all reined in.

A moment later, Wen Caishang withdrew her fingers. Hao Qing felt as if she had been pardoned, cold sweat pouring down as she gasped for breath. She quickly cupped her hands and said, "Senior, this junior does not know where she has offended you. Please be clear, and this junior will correct it."

Wen Caishang said, "Has my little man seen you?"

Hao Qing said, "Little man?" Wen Caishang nodded slightly. Hao Qing was polite in her tone, but her heart was pounding, and her injury was severe.

Hao Qing was completely bewildered. "Please be clear, Senior." She secretly felt regretful, reviewing the past. Wen Caishang pointed to her own forehead and said, "He has a red mole here."

Hao Qing's heart skipped a beat. She thought, "Ah! The 'little man' this Senior is referring to is that Hua Wu Cuo. He... he was poisoned to death by me. How... how can he have such a powerful wife? How did she find me so quickly? If I say I know him, she will ask for details. What should I do?"

She said respectfully, "May I ask for your name, Senior?"

Wen Caishang said, "Wen Caishang." Hao Qing's temperament was eccentric and untamable, and she was disdainful of her reputation in the Jianghu. She did not know the name 'Wen Caishang' and said, "So it is Senior Wen, my apologies. Are you looking for your little man because he is lost?"

Wen Caishang said, "My little man is mischievous. I just let him have his fun." She turned her hand and poured herself a cup of tea, taking a light sip on her own.

Hao Qing said, "Your relationship with that little man must be very good." Wen Caishang said, "Not exactly. If I see him, I must punish him severely. I'll pierce him full of holes."

Hao Qing asked, "And then?"

Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes rippled. "He would surely be in great pain, and I would feel great heartache. Then I would heal his wounds, treat him with excellent medicine, and comfort him well. I would keep him by my side. But this matter is hard for me to forget easily. Whenever I think of it, I can't help but pierce him full of holes again. Who told him to dare deceive even me?" As she spoke, her words were filled with both resentment and affection, a mix of anger and love.

Hao Qing's scalp went numb. Her mind raced: "I, Hao Qing, consider myself unpredictable and willful. But in front of her, I wouldn't dare to act out in the slightest. Her words are calm, but they hide deep affection. I absolutely cannot say that Hua Wu Cuo is dead, nor can I reveal his whereabouts. Otherwise, if she finds out the truth, she can find me now, and she can find me in the future. I must use her deep affection to my advantage, trick her with words, then seek a chance to use poison to turn the tables and escape this dangerous situation. Even capture her!" She said, "Senior... I am quite skilled at finding people. If you don't mind, I might be able to help you find that little man. And I also know a way to make him never leave you again."

Wen Caishang smiled meaningfully and said softly, "You are quite clever."

Hao Qing said joyfully, "Then does Senior agree?"

Wen Caishang shook her head. "But you like to play little tricks. I don't like people playing little tricks. You have definitely seen my little man."

Hao Qing broke out in a cold sweat. "Senior's little man is exceptionally handsome. If I had seen him, I would surely have an impression. Senior... Qing's Snake truly did not lie to you. Please be clear."

Wen Caishang sighed. "I hate being lied to the most. I'll give you a chance. Say it again. If you lie again, I'll ask you to leave your head behind."

Hao Qing's heart pounded. She was caught in great hesitation, not knowing if the other was deliberately bluffing or truly knew the inside story. Wen Caishang said gently, "Please say it again. Have you seen my little man?"

Hao Qing felt her whole body go weak. She didn't dare to gamble anymore and nodded. "I... I have seen him."

Wen Caishang said, "That's a good and clever girl. Please continue. What is your relationship with my little man?"

Hao Qing suddenly understood. The reason Wen Caishang had scrutinized her face was because she was jealous. Hao Qing thought: "Even if she is jealous, she might not kill me immediately. If she knows I killed her little man, my end will be miserable." She quickly said, "I... my relationship with him is... I quite appreciate him. His martial arts talent, his looks, his way of dealing with the world, are all commendable."

Wen Caishang smiled meaningfully again. "You're not being a good girl again." As her words fell, a green light flashed. Hao Qing suddenly went numb. A 'buzzing' sound reached her ears. A moment later, she came to her senses and saw a very deep trench on the ground, like a sword mark. The sword mark extended for about forty to fifty feet.

A arm fell off, getting stuck in the sword mark.

Pain suddenly struck Hao Qing. She realized her left arm had been severed.

Hao Qing's face turned pale. She secretly felt fear. How this sword was swung, she still couldn't detect. If it had been aimed at her neck, she would already be dead. She quickly covered her severed arm, her eyes flickering as she thought, "My blood contains a unique toxin. Though it's a pity my arm is gone, if I can use the blood's nature to poison this woman, that would be wonderful!" She was about to use her power to harm her when she suddenly felt an immense terror. The thought was forcefully suppressed, and she didn't dare to act rashly.

She didn't know that Wen Caishang's Silkworm Technique protected her body, and she was proficient in all paths. Though the Way of Poison was not her specialty, her attainment was still considerable.

Wen Caishang took a light sip of her tea and said, "You're still lying to me. Since you don't dare to speak, then I will. If I'm not mistaken, you and my little man are enemies, aren't you?"

Hao Qing's heart pounded like a needle had pricked it. She felt deep fear. This woman had come for no apparent reason and knew everything for no apparent reason. Her expression was ashen as she said, "No... that's right. He and I are indeed enemies."

Wen Caishang said, "That's more like it." She then asked, "Why did you become enemies?"

Hao Qing said truthfully, "There... there was no reason. I purely..." Wen Caishang nodded. "The Jianghu is vast, filled with strange and eccentric people. Making enemies with someone isn't necessarily about conflicting interests. Sometimes, others simply find you displeasing to the eye and hold a grudge. I've taught him this principle."

Hao Qing asked, "I bullied him. Aren't you angry with me?"

Wen Caishang thought: "Though he is a hundred times in the wrong, if others dare to bully him, I would naturally be displeased. But this little thief is cunning and wants to avoid my pursuit. If I don't let him suffer some bullying, how will he know who treats him best." She said, "Jianghu grudges, what is there to be angry about? With your strength, bullying him is more than enough. He was only driven to desperation by you before he belatedly remembered me."

She added, "In the end, it means... he still thinks of me."

Hao Qing knew that after this point, there was nothing more to ask. She had already lost an arm and was no match for this woman. Though this woman said she wasn't angry, judging by her temperament, she was not a kind or generous person and would surely make things difficult for her. Her life was likely forfeit.

The only plan now was to use the news of her little man's death to disturb her mind, then seize an opportunity to escape quickly. Her life and death rested on this one gamble. Hao Qing said, "Don't you want to know what happened to your little man after he opposed me?"

Wen Caishang said, "Go on."

Hao Qing said, "He is dead. He was killed by my Yin Demon Heart-Devouring Palm!" Wen Caishang showed no surprise, a hint of contempt at her lips. She said, "Though you have empty cultivation, you are no match for my little man."

Hao Qing was stunned. It was completely different from what she had expected. She thought, "She loves her little man so much. Why is she so calm upon hearing of his death? Could it be she doesn't believe me? I'll continue to provoke her." She pretended to be calm and said with a faint smile, "I am indeed no match for you, but your little man is also no match for me. You can kill me easily, so can't I kill him easily?"

Wen Caishang said, "Arguing with you is meaningless."

"You are about to be played to death by him, yet you are completely unaware."

She then let out a long sigh and said, "Sigh, my feelings are so complicated now. I want to kill you, but I don't want to give him what he wants. Yet, you have bullied him, and I am truly angry. My little man, how dare you bully him? You injured him, and my heart aches terribly. But he has betrayed me like this, why should I be angry for him? Yet, I can't help but be furious."

Hao Qing saw that Wen Caishang was not provoked at all. She knew her fate was entirely in the other's hands, with no hope left. She sat down in despair, listening to her soft words as if being flayed alive.

Wen Caishang said, "After thinking it over, you will take one of my moves. If you survive, you live. If you don't, then you die here."

Hao Qing said, "Please proceed, Senior."

The next instant, a 'cracking' sound, and this wilderness inn collapsed. Hao Qing's figure was sent flying, enveloped by a powerful internal qi, plowing a deep trench in the ground. Wherever the qi passed, grass and trees were reduced to dust.

With a 'thud', Hao Qing's body crashed into a large tree. The tree split with a sound, its trunk leaning over. The leaves turned from yellow to green, then from green to yellow, before 'rustling' down, turning the tree into a withered stump.

This was the 'Four Seasons Alternating Moon Palm'. It contained the perception of the four seasons' cycle. The palm qi was long-lasting and indelible, its force endless. Hao Qing's momentum was still unstoppable, unable to be halted. She felt her life was about to end. Her body was like a small boat, the palm qi like a wild wave, pushing her far away. Along the way, collisions with tree trunks, stones, and the ground could not stop her momentum.

In that instant, she had flown over a hundred zhang. This force, though it caused Hao Qing numerous external injuries—skin broken, blood flowing, bones fractured—was not a fatal blow.

The Four Seasons Alternating Moon Palm...

The palm qi seemed to演 evolve through the four seasons. Wen Caishang's cultivation was high, and her martial arts attainment was profound. This palm qi contained the evolution of the four seasons. If she struck into empty space, the qi could linger for months. This was all because her martial arts evolution had reached an extremely high level.

Hao Qing was struck by this palm. In an instant, her body felt as if it were passing through spring and summer, then enduring autumn and winter... sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes dry and stifled. Wen Caishang had comprehended the principles of Yin and Yang from the 'Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword'. It resonated with the Four Seasons Alternating Moon Palm, creating a mutual school of thought. The palm force possessed an even greater sense of the passage of time, the alternation of sun and moon.

Hao Qing could not dissolve the palm force. She felt even more... that every time her body passed through spring, summer, autumn, and winter, her qi and blood would weaken a layer. It was as if she had aged a year, wasted a year of her life.

She was terrified. As she flew backwards, the palm qi gradually fused into her body. Martial artists seek to train their bodies to be like the heavens and earth. If this palm qi fused into her body, the heaven and earth within Hao Qing's body would be in chaos with the four seasons. How could she feel comfortable.

Even if she could barely survive, her lifespan would rapidly decrease, as if 'a day feels like a year'. It wouldn't be long before she was old and feeble.

In this critical moment, she immediately activated her poison technique, seeking to dissolve it. Fortunately... Wen Caishang's 'Four Seasons Alternating Moon Palm', though profound in attainment, this move 'Four Seasons Alternation' was newly领悟ed (comprehended) and not fully under her control. If she wanted to kill Hao Qing, she had many palm techniques and sword moves to use, making it easy to kill her instantly or make her die in agony. But precisely because she was unsure whether to kill her, or rather, because she was angry that Hao Qing had bullied her lover, yet she was unwilling to completely顺 (follow) her lover's wishes, she was in a contradictory mood and used this palm technique.

Whether she lived or died, even Wen Caishang did not know.

Only a 'cracking' sound was heard.

Hao Qing was sent flying several miles, crashing into a boulder. Cracks appeared all over her bones. Her internal organs, muscles, and flesh... all suffered tremendous damage. The palm qi finally subsided, and the evolution of the four seasons gradually stopped. She was severely injured, her life hanging by a thread, but she had indeed barely survived.

This place was several miles away from the inn.

It wasn't brute force. Wen Caishang's pure physical strength was not as good as Li Xian's. It was purely that her internal qi and martial arts attainment were profound. After leaving her body, it continued to evolve, making the pushing force not diminish, carrying Hao Qing several miles away. This showed that Wen Caishang had not held back and did harbor a hint of killing intent.

Hao Qing lay on the ground, gasping for breath. She checked her body and found her injuries were severe. The toxins she had nurtured inside her were all affected by the palm qi and had been震杀 (shaken to death). Suddenly, a fragrant breeze blew, and a pair of white boots appeared in her vision. She looked up.

Wen Caishang was before her. Her hands were placed in front of her abdomen, her hair bun fluttering gently, her posture still elegant.

She said, "You have some ability. Since you didn't die, then live on."

Hao Qing felt as if she had been granted a pardon. She dared not hold any resentment and said, "Thank you for your mercy, Senior." Watching her departing figure, graceful as a startled swan, elegant as a swimming dragon, until it disappeared from sight, she finally breathed a long sigh of relief. For the first time in her life, she tasted the feeling that there are always greater heights and there are always people beyond oneself.

Xiao Tuan asked in confusion, "Madam, weren't we going to capture him? Why didn't you ask for his whereabouts?" The 'him' in her words referred to Li Xian.

Wen Caishang remained silent. She thought, "That little thief is as cunning as a fox, becoming harder and harder to catch. My silkworm thread tracker has been identified by him. Otherwise, he would never have appeared in this Hao Qing's hair. Even if I asked for his whereabouts, I would surely come up empty. What's the use of asking?" A hint of anger flashed in her beautiful eyes.

She rolled up her sleeves and looked at the 'sword brand'. Their minds were connected. If Li Xian had died, she would have sensed it. That's why when she encountered Hao Qing, she had a suspicion.

She returned to the inn.

This place was in the wilderness, and the inn was built of wood. It suddenly collapsed, startling all the guests inside. They were thrown into a state of confusion, their heads bleeding from being struck by debris. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured.

Everyone was indignant and furious, all seeking compensation from the innkeeper. The innkeeper was heartbroken, having suffered the greatest loss, his face turning a dark green, unwilling to compensate.

Wen Caishang walked over gracefully. Everyone immediately looked at her, their eyes dazed, showing infatuated expressions. Someone痴痴 (stupidly) said, "Oh, a fairy from the moon has descended to earth." Wen Caishang said softly, "This young girl acted a bit too heavily, damaging the inn and disturbing your sleep. I am truly sorry. Xiao Tuan, take a few taels of gold and give them to the innkeeper. Consider it compensation."

Her tone held no apology, but her manners were impeccable.

Upon hearing that she had 'damaged the inn', everyone's hearts tightened. No one dared to blame her.

Wen Caishang returned to the carriage. She lay on her side, her gaze distant. This 'Xiao Tuan' was a girl she had encountered by chance. The girl was clever and deft with her hands, used by Wen Caishang for her 'Silkworm Garment Jade Concealment Technique'.

The relocation of the manor was already seventy percent prepared. Another major matter was progressing steadily. She was skilled in handling affairs, weighing benefits, and playing with people's hearts, all of which she did with ease. The people and things she planned for were all proceeding as planned.

"That little thief's cunning far exceeds my expectations. But even if I don't know where he is, I have a way to capture him."
