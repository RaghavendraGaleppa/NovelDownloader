# Chapter 597: Departure

Wherever the silk threads passed, the deep structures supporting the Heavenly Realm groaned with a grating sound, and it was visible to the naked eye that the realm's celestial canopy was being eroded and decomposed...

It was like a giant, rotten tree being devoured by billions of worms.

It was less like a Pu Du True Lord and more like a colossal scavenger perched upon a corpse, greedily sucking in the last remnants of the Primordial Origin Dao Rhyme of this Heavenly Realm.

That was the Dao Fruit of the Heavenly Emperor, the very foundation upon which the Heavenly Court existed.

Xu Yunfan could feel the authority and celestial dignity that once belonged to the master of this realm's Heavenly Court being finely torn apart and devoured into Pu Du True Lord's inner world.

The Dao Will of the Taihua Lingxu Realm naturally felt a degree of displeasure, but faced with a Golden Core True Lord who declared 'My fate is in my own hands, not in the heavens', it could only feel a sense of helplessness. It instinctively accelerated its own consumption of the Heavenly Realm's celestial canopy.

With every wisp of origin energy extracted, the celestial dome fractured even more completely.

In response, a massive shadow covering half of the Heavenly Realm's firmament appeared. This was the root system of the Taihua Lingxu Realm.

It was like a dark red celestial body of unimaginable size, forcefully squeezing its way into this realm from the shattered void beyond the heavens.

Its edges rubbed violently against the spatial barriers of the Heavenly Realm, and every tremor triggered violent spatial collapses that spread for thousands of miles.

The outer layer of the Taihua Lingxu Realm was not rock or earth, but rather writhing, flesh-like tentacles that seemed to be alive.

Wherever they passed, the void barriers of the Heavenly Realm were like prey torn apart and devoured by a giant beast, disappearing inch by inch, patch by patch, completely covered and assimilated by the writhing roots.

The Heavenly Realm, this once sacred diadem that hung above countless minor worlds, was now riddled with holes, on the verge of completely returning to the chaotic void.

Its final cry of agony was the spatial fissures that covered the world and the ceaseless, ever-present void storms.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained as calm as still water as he retracted his gaze. His spiritual sense, like invisible tentacles, spread out with迅猛 speed.

In this vast wasteland of apocalyptic dust, he used the secrets of Heavenly Mechanism and Karma to precisely search for top-tier remnants that had not been completely plundered in the previous rounds, or those that could only be born and erupt at the very edge of destruction.

In the end times, world treasures are naturally born.

Flashing lights, one after another, of ancient or strange fluctuations were drawn into his袖中乾坤 (Sleeve Universe).

The opportunity was rare; one would regret it immensely if missed.

One treasure after another, or fragments of incomplete Dao Rhymes, were continuously thrown into the Sleeve Universe.

Xu Yunfan's speed was as fast as a ghost, his gaze precise.

He could even feel the occasional crossing of a few powerful spiritual senses from the shadows, filled with vigilance and probing, but none would pay much attention to a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator like him.

Furthermore, he had the banner of True Lord Qingyuan hanging over his head.

The immortal light of Pu Du True Lord grew increasingly scorching, and the rumble of the Taihua Lingxu Realm's writhing and devouring was deafening. Time was passing by the second.

Finally, after a last, incredibly powerful spiritual sense swept through the depths of a shattered divine hall and confirmed that not a trace of valuable origin energy remained, Xu Yunfan's figure shot up into the sky.

It was time to leave this realm. If he didn't, he would be in great danger when this realm's celestial canopy was destroyed.

The Sleeve Universe was heavy, filled with the most bountiful plunder of this trip.

As he flew back, Xu Yunfan's figure paused slightly, his gaze falling upon the lands of the mortal kingdoms below, which had become a true purgatory.

These mortal kingdoms had long since been turned to scorched earth and ruins in the initial shockwave. The surviving creatures were completely numb, either huddled in the corners of collapsed mountain caves waiting for death, or wandering aimlessly like walking dead under the blood-colored sky.

When the celestial dome above them completely collapsed and vanished, these trillions of creatures dependent on the Heavenly Realm, along with the even more vast layers of minor worlds below, would silently turn into a wisp of dust in the void.

Xu Yunfan retracted his gaze, no longer feeling a shred of pity.

To be fair, the Primordial Origin Sect's actions were indeed in line with the style of extraterrestrial demons. Not only the Primordial Origin Sect, but the Bodhisattva Pure Land and the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect were the same.

And he, Xu Yunfan, as a disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect with outstanding military merits for being the first to ascend, was essentially doing the same by seizing what he needed from destruction.

A complex, indescribable meaning slowly settled and merged into his Dao Foundation.

Hmm, as a disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect, it was hard to disentangle himself from this.

Xu Yunfan no longer lingered. His form transformed into an unremarkable star-grey stream of light, rushing towards the periphery of the Heavenly Realm, towards the direction of the breach created by the power of the Taihua Lingxu Realm.

Having left the core of that dilapidated realm, the scene before him changed dramatically.

A vast, colorless, and lightless void platform appeared before him.

This was a transitional zone where the annihilation of the old realm and the entrance to the new realm intertwined.

In the distance, the colossal Taihua Lingxu Realm entrance, which occupied his entire field of vision, was constantly expanding and contracting, like a writhing giant mouth, devouring the last remnants of the Heavenly Realm. Each writhing motion brought about a silent spatial tremor.

Countless dark red streams of light, like massive blood vessels, flickered around the entrance, pumping the essence of what was devoured back into the depths of the Lingxu Realm.

This void zone in front of the entrance was known as the First Ascension Platform. Several figures stood there, some surrounded by solid golden light flames, some exuding an unfathomable, nebula-like vast aura, and more majestic existences with Buddhist light contained within but oppressive might hidden. They each occupied a region, and though their auras were not linked, they had cut off and sealed this void space.

They were all Golden Core True Lords.

His evasion light instantly retracted to its limit, becoming completely inconspicuous. He respectfully flew along the safe passage edge tacitly permitted by these existences.

The air was filled with fluctuations of spiritual sense probes, sweeping meticulously over every corner like water ripples. The terrifying will contained within was enough to make a Foundation Establishment cultivator's soul tremble.

Xu Yunfan lowered his gaze. Within his Dantian, the origin power that had been baptized by the Heavenly Realm's Grand Yin Mysterious Mirror Dao Fruit operated quietly, activating the Primordial Origin Sect's secret art to conceal karma. It flowed like water over solid rock, perfectly concealing and suppressing all the spiritual power fluctuations of the late Foundation Establishment stage.

Although a Golden Core True Lord was as powerful as the sun, under his deliberate concealment, unless they conducted a deep investigation on purpose, they would only get the impression that he was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator with a solid foundation.

Soon, Xu Yunfan clearly locked onto the center of the First Ascension Platform, where a suspended stone hall floated.

Above the entrance to the hall were two ancient seal script characters.

Qingyuan.

This was the temporary residence of True Lord Qingyuan, the Golden Core True Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect in this invasion of the Heavenly Realm.

As a disciple under True Lord Qingyuan, Xu Yunfan naturally had to pay his respects.

As he approached the stone hall, the pressure originating from the Golden Core realm suddenly intensified.

It felt like an invisible weight of millions of tons descending upon him all at once.

Xu Yunfan dared not be negligent. He landed at the foot of the stone steps, straightened his robes and hat, and bowed deeply.

"Lower-branch disciple Xu Yunfan, greets True Lord Qingyuan!"

His clear voice pierced through the void, carrying the respect of a disciple meeting his elder.

The silence lasted only a barely perceptible moment.

The seemingly heavy stone door of the hall opened silently inward.

Inside, there were no carved beams or painted rafters, but a deep, swirling flow of immortal palace pure energy. The clear light illuminated a figure seated upon a cloud platform in the void.
