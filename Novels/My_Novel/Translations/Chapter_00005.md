# Chapter 5: Boiling the Elixir, Plans in Chaos

Three days passed in a flash.

In the back courtyard of the desolate house, Li Xian threw a fierce punch. The force of the fist was terrifying, tearing through the air with a sound that seemed to resemble the roar of a Green Ox.

\[Wild Ox Fist · Incomplete Form\]

\[Proficiency: 412/1000 Mastery\]

\[Description: The wild ox eats grass, focusing on dormancy. One must settle their breath and guard their spirit, neither arrogant nor rash, to achieve great things.\]

Hearing footsteps approaching, Li Xian quickly retracted his stance and lowered his head to pull weeds.

Playing the slacker… he was already well-versed in the act. He would pull a patch of weeds and practice a few sets of fists. This way, he could fool the inspectors, and no one would know that he was secretly practicing martial arts.

"Twelve days left. At this rate, my Wild Ox Fist is bound to improve further, reaching Minor Achievement!"

"It's a pity this fist technique is merely an incomplete form, not a complete system."

His greatest rival was Bi Hao. This fellow was well-versed in the "Three Talents Fist." Though Li Xian didn't know the specifics of the fist technique, it was at least complete.

If they were to face off head-on, unless he could catch him off guard and defeat him in a single move, the other party, relying on the completeness of his fist technique, would surely be able to secure victory.

The situation was not optimistic. The only way to seize this opportunity was to study and train diligently, striving for a higher attainment in the Wild Ox Fist.

"Know the enemy and know yourself, and you will fight a hundred battles without defeat. In a few days, I'll go spy on Bi Hao practicing his fist."

Li Xian heard the footsteps fade away. He kicked the weeds to the side, spread his legs, and began practicing the Wild Ox Fist again.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency +1\]

Accumulating the capital for a turnaround, bit by bit.

Another three days passed in the blink of an eye. The proficiency of the Wild Ox Fist had reached 712. Before the Guard Competition, breaking through to the Minor Achievement realm was practically a sure thing.

What delighted Li Xian even more was that his Weeding skill had also made progress.

\[Skill: Weeding\]

\[Proficiency: 29/2000 Grand Mastery\]

\[Description: After weeding countless times, have you not yet achieved enlightenment? Weeds cannot be eradicated completely; they grow again when the spring breeze blows. The principle of endless vitality lies within. You now possess a tenacity that is out of the ordinary!\]

He had gained insight from weeding.

In Li Xian's perception, he had become more steady. He had endured the boredom and loneliness, and withstood the toil and the bitter cold.

Just as Li Xian thought everything would continue this way, the next day, at noon, a sudden gong rang out.

Li Xian frowned. This was the sound to summon the laborers. Anyone who heard the gong three times and failed to assemble could be executed according to the manor's rules.

"What on earth is happening? I've never encountered a situation like this."

In front of the laborers' quarters, over a thousand laborers had gathered, pushing and shoving against each other.

Everyone was busy with their work during the day, not a moment to spare. They were all covered in dust and grime, their laborer tunics gray and tattered.

Li Xian was no exception.

During the assembly, Li Xian deliberately looked around but didn't see Bi Hao. When he passed by Luo Fang's hut earlier, he faintly heard the sound of fist winds...

It seemed Luo Fang had arranged for Bi Hao to practice martial arts inside his room.

"Luo Fang is truly generous to Bi Hao. But he must have his own motives. If Bi Hao becomes a guard, Luo Fang's position will be even more stable."

In the crowd, Li Xian pondered silently.

Luo Fang ordered the squad leaders to take a headcount of their respective squads. Seeing that no one was missing, he finally spoke: "You people, your luck is simply too good, too good."

"I'm telling you, the honor of serving the Madam of the manor is something you wouldn't be able to get even if you begged for it!"

Luo Fang went on with his usual heartfelt praise for the mysterious Madam of the manor. He finally said: "The Madam is going to boil an 'Elixir.' This Elixir requires a large amount of water to be stewed. You, over a thousand of you, starting today, will put aside all your other work and focus on transporting water from a mountain spring three miles away back to the manor."

"The squad leaders should already know what to do. I don't need to go into detail. Get started."

With a wave of his sleeve, he left alone.

Li Xian sensed something was amiss and grabbed a nearby laborer, asking, "What's going on? Boiling an 'Elixir,' does it really require over a thousand laborers to transport water?"

"You must be new," the laborer sighed. "What those big shots deal with isn't something we can understand. We just do as we're told. Asking questions won't get you any benefits."

In a daze, Li Xian was swept along by the crowd out of the One-Harmony Manor. He was assigned to stand about thirty yards from the manor.

The squad leader of the ninth laborer squad said to Li Xian, "Number Twenty-Seven, you wait here. When you see someone bringing water, you go receive it, then pass the water to the next person."

Li Xian understood... So the water transport was done in a relay. Each person carried the water for a stretch, ensuring the flow of water never stopped.

"Truly something, this Madam... With a single thought of hers, we have to work our hearts out."

Li Xian steadied his mind and asked, "Squad Leader, in the past, how long did something like this usually last? Doesn't our manor have water?"

The squad leader frowned, showing a look of displeasure. Li Xian, quick-witted, slipped three coins into the squad leader's pocket and added, "I'm just curious. I hope the Squad Leader can enlighten me."

The squad leader put away the money, and his expression softened considerably.

"Telling you is fine. A person like the Madam, her food is vastly different from ours."

"I heard this time they're boiling a certain strange meat. It needs to be stewed until soft and tender to remove the toxicity. Conservatively estimated... it will take three days and three nights to boil. Of course, we have water in the manor... but what if it's not enough?"

"So, the moment the boiling starts, we also need to start transporting water. Do a good job. Every time we encounter something like this, those who survive can get a reward of ten coins."

"And what's more, you get a full meal. At the very least, you'll get a chicken leg. Tsk tsk, that flavor."

The squad leader revealed an expression of anticipation.

Li Xian's heart skipped a beat. "There's a risk of death?"

"Of course," the squad leader said impatiently. "As long as the Elixir is being boiled, we have to keep working. We only get a short break at noon and in the evening. With this kind of intensity, you'll either be worked to death or exhausted to death. You..."

"You look pretty scrawny. I really can't say if you'll be able to hold on."

"This..." Li Xian felt a deep sense of powerlessness. This sudden accident had completely disrupted his plans.

Staying here and transporting water at all times meant he couldn't practice his fist technique!

"Three days... I hope it can be boiled in three days, that way I still have a chance!"

Li Xian clenched his fist.

Living in a deep mansion, one's fate is not in their own hands. Meanwhile, Bi Hao... is quietly practicing his fist right now.

Comparing the two, the gap immediately widened.

But since he was here, he had to make the best of it. There are many difficult things in the world and few easy ones. Giving up easily is not Li Xian's style.

Autumn had already passed, and winter was approaching. After a brief warm breeze, the chill in the air grew stronger.

"Water coming! Those behind, hurry up and receive the water!"

"Ouch, be careful! Don't splash it, or you'll get whipped."

On a distant hill, laborers carrying a bucket in each hand rushed down the mountain.

After handing over their buckets, they hurriedly climbed back up the mountain path to continue fetching and delivering water, repeating the process over and over.

Li Xian looked out from afar. Each laborer was a tiny black dot, and the dots formed a line...

Like diligent ants, building a martial artist's tower with their own flesh and blood.

And he himself was just one of the many black dots.

"Number Twenty-Seven, what are you spacing out for? Hurry up and receive the water!"

A laborer in the distance shouted.

Li Xian quickly ran over, picked up a bucket of water in each hand, and hurriedly delivered it to the next laborer.

He had internal energy in his body, and thanks to the tenacious attribute added by his Weeding skill, carrying the water back and forth was much easier.

He probably wouldn't be worked to death, but it was a huge waste of his time.
