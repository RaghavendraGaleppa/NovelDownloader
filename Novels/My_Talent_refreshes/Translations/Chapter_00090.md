# Chapter 90: Flying Magical Artifacts and Shapeshifting Spells

"Fellow Daoist can see the entire auction hall from the room. If you fancy any item, you may bid directly. All our rooms are equipped with restrictions."

The attendant led Chu Ning into the room, then stood outside the door and spoke. "If Fellow Daoist successfully bids for an item, it will be delivered via the circular platform in front. Fellow Daoist just needs to place the corresponding spirit stones on it."

Chu Ning nodded, indicating he understood. Then, remembering something else, he asked the attendant, "What if there's nothing suitable for me at this auction?"

The attendant smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist can approach me directly after the auction, or tell me what you're looking for now. I can check if such items are among the auctioned goods. If not, I can arrange to find them for you beforehand."

Hearing how convenient this was, Chu Ning immediately said, "In that case, Fellow Daoist, please keep an eye out for any flying magical artifacts and comprehensive books on spirit beasts."

After a pause, Chu Ning added, "Also, please look out for any spirit pills or herbs that can strengthen divine sense."

The attendant's expression remained normal when hearing the former requests, but a hint of surprise appeared on his face when Chu Ning mentioned spirit pills and herbs for strengthening divine sense. Clearly, he was quite curious as to why a mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator like Chu Ning would inquire about such items. However, his surprise was fleeting, and he quickly regained his composure.

"Understood, Fellow Daoist, please wait a moment." The attendant replied, then turned and left.

Only now did Chu Ning curiously examine the small room. He had previously felt a layer of restriction in the small rooms on the first floor of Cloud Sea Pavilion back in Green River Market. These restrictions could block prying eyes and even alter voices. Now, he wanted to see for himself.

Chu Ning looked around and found the small room to be square, only about ten feet in size. Three of its walls were made of an unknown metal, but the wall facing forward was a transparent material. It looked like it was made of glazed glass. A faint, thin halo of light shimmered on the surface of this glass, clearly indicating some sort of restriction. Presumably, it was this restriction that served to block observation and alter voices.

"Although this restriction blocks external observation, these rooms on the second floor aren't spaced very far apart. When people enter or exit, if one pays a little attention, they can actually still glimpse who they are."

Chu Ning couldn't help but mutter to himself.

"Fellow Daoist, may I enter?" Just then, a voice, belonging to the same attendant, sounded from outside the room. After Chu Ning responded, the attendant walked in. He then handed a jade slip to Chu Ning.

"Our shopkeeper says that since Fellow Daoist came with a Foundation Establishment senior, you are a distinguished guest of our Pavilion. This jade slip contains some basic information about the items in this auction, as well as details about the spirit beast books you just mentioned. Feel free to browse it first, and call me if you have any requests."

Chu Ning immediately took the jade slip, and after the attendant left, he began to examine it. As he browsed the information within the jade slip, Chu Ning felt a mix of joy and concern.

What delighted Chu Ning was that there truly was a flying magical artifact in this auction. Named the Gale-Chasing Shuttle, it was a high-grade, shuttle-shaped artifact. According to the jade slip, after being crafted from high-quality materials, several superimposed wind-element arrays were inscribed upon it. Its flying speed was extremely fast. However, because it was a high-grade artifact, especially a relatively rare flying one, its starting bid was as high as 700 spirit stones.

"Originally, I just wanted to see if there was a mid-grade flying magical artifact I could buy for use. Now, a high-grade flying artifact has actually appeared at this auction. This means the competition will naturally be fierce, and it will probably cost quite a few spirit stones in the end."

Chu Ning muttered to himself, but he was determined to acquire this Gale-Chasing Shuttle. This was because it was the only flying magical artifact available in this auction.

Regarding books on spirit beasts, the jade slip indicated that none were being auctioned. However, Cloud Sea Pavilion also provided two books for Chu Ning's reference. One was called the Myriad Beasts Atlas, mainly introducing the habits and characteristics of various spirit beasts and demon beasts. Its price in the jade slip was 200 low-grade spirit stones. The other, named the Classic of a Hundred Beasts, detailed cultivation methods for 100 types of spirit beasts, priced at a hefty 2000 low-grade spirit stones.

Chu Ning thought about it and decided that even if he were to buy one, he would opt for the Myriad Beasts Atlas. After all, he just wanted to find information related to Little White, and had no interest whatsoever in cultivation methods.

However, when Chu Ning saw the information in the jade slip regarding spirit medicine for strengthening divine sense, he directly shook his head. According to the information provided, such spirit medicine was hard to come by even among Foundation Establishment cultivators, and their prices were typically measured in tens of thousands of spirit stones. This forced Chu Ning, who had originally considered buying some spirit medicine to accelerate his Spirit Refinement Technique cultivation, to abandon the idea altogether.

However, within the same jade slip, another item caught Chu Ning's interest.

Before Chu Ning could finish reading the information about this item, a gentle bell sound rang out. He looked up and saw a middle-aged man in brocade robes slowly appearing on the circular platform between the first and second floors.

"Fellow Daoists, I am Bai Shuangquan, the host of this Cloud Sea Pavilion auction." The auction was about to officially begin.

After a simple opening speech, the auction officially commenced.

The first item Bai Shuangquan brought out for auction was a high-grade defensive magical artifact. Chu Ning had already seen the relevant information. He knew that although this artifact was high-grade, it was more suitable for water-attribute cultivation techniques. Therefore, Chu Ning had no interest in it. Ultimately, this water-attribute high-grade defensive artifact was bought by a cultivator for 1150 spirit stones.

"Defensive artifacts are indeed more valuable than offensive ones, and this flying artifact's starting bid is even 100 spirit stones higher than the defensive artifact's..."

Chu Ning secretly grumbled to himself. He remembered that a high-grade gold-attribute offensive artifact he had seen at an auction in Green River Market had only fetched a final price of 700 spirit stones.

Chu Ning had also reviewed the next few auctioned items beforehand. Since they weren't what he needed, Chu Ning remained silent.

"The seventh item for auction is the Gale-Chasing Shuttle, a single-person flying magical artifact. Starting bid is 700 spirit stones, with each increment no less than 50 spirit stones..."

Hearing Bai Shuangquan's voice, Chu Ning's spirits lifted. It's here.

"750 spirit stones!" As soon as Bai Shuangquan's words fell, a voice immediately rang out. "800 spirit stones!" "850 spirit stones!" Subsequently, various bidding voices rose one after another. Chu Ning felt his teeth itch with frustration.

His original intention was not to bid immediately, to avoid everyone driving up the price all at once. But his silence didn't mean others would also remain silent. After five or six people successively made bids, the price quickly surpassed 1000 spirit stones. Seeing this, Chu Ning also joined the bidding, as waiting too long would make him stand out too much.

"1050 spirit stones!" Chu Ning spoke, but the voice that was transmitted outside was somewhat deep and resonant.

"1100 spirit stones!" Immediately, another voice followed, "1150 spirit stones!"

Chu Ning waited for one or two breaths before speaking again: "1200 spirit stones."

To Chu Ning's surprise, this time the voice had changed again, becoming an older, more aged sound.

This undoubtedly made Chu Ning feel a touch of emotion.

"This voice-altering restriction is quite interesting. The voice changes each time, and even the direction of the sound is different. It seems Cloud Sea Pavilion had already accounted for the small flaw I'd previously thought of. Even if a bid is successfully made, one wouldn't know which room it came from."

At this moment, the venue fell silent for a brief moment. Then Bai Shuangquan's voice rang out, "1200 spirit stones, any other Fellow Daoist wishing to bid?" As soon as he finished, another voice reappeared. "1250 spirit stones."

Hearing this, Chu Ning sighed helplessly in his heart and calmly spoke, "1300 spirit stones!"

The venue fell silent again. Bai Shuangquan continued to ask, "1300 spirit stones, any other Fellow Daoist wishing to bid?" He asked twice consecutively, but this time, no one responded.

"1300 spirit stones, sold!" As Bai Shuangquan's words fell, Chu Ning secretly sighed in relief.

His biggest goal for this trip had finally been achieved, though the Gale-Chasing Shuttle's price was raised to a whopping 1300 spirit stones. Even with his current wealth, he couldn't help but feel a slight pang of heartache.

In just a short while, a circular tray appeared on the platform in front of Chu Ning, bearing a black shuttle-shaped magical artifact. Chu Ning picked it up and examined it, then took out 1300 spirit stones from his storage bag and placed them on the tray. The tray then teleported away.

Having successfully bid for the Gale-Chasing Shuttle, Chu Ning naturally paid less attention to the subsequent items. His focus was now on the fifteenth auctioned item.

The auction proceeded item by item, and the first fourteen items were quickly concluded. Bai Shuangquan's voice soon rang out again.

"The fifteenth item for auction is a volume of Shapeshifting Spells. After cultivating this spell, one can freely change their appearance and voice. A reminder: this spell cannot conceal or alter one's spiritual power fluctuations. The starting bid is 300 spirit stones..."

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning's eyes lit up slightly. This was precisely the item he had been very interested in when he had examined the jade slip earlier. His Yin Wood Spirit Body had the ability to automatically conceal his spiritual power; if he wished, he could even completely suppress his spiritual power and appear as a mortal. However, he had always felt that if he could combine it with an item that changed his appearance, the effect would naturally be even better. And this current Shapeshifting Spell undoubtedly fit Chu Ning's intentions perfectly.

"300 spirit stones." Chu Ning immediately bid the starting price.

At this moment, someone else bid, "330 spirit stones."

Chu Ning waited for two breaths, and finding no one else bidding, he followed up with his own bid, "360 spirit stones."

Perhaps because this Shapeshifting manual lacked the ability to conceal or alter spiritual power fluctuations, others were not interested. After all, even if an ordinary cultivator changed their appearance, they would still be recognized once their aura was sensed by others.

After Chu Ning's latest bid, no one else made an offer. Chu Ning thus successfully acquired this volume of Shapeshifting Spells for 360 spirit stones.
