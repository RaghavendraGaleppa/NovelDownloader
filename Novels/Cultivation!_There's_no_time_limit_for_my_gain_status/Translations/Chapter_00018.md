# Chapter 18: Wood Yin Infusion

In such a dense environment of Yin energy, an ordinary person would drop dead within ten seconds of exposure.  

Jiang Li, as an internal martial artist with vigorous Qi and abundant blood, still felt an all-pervading chill. Over time, the cold penetrated from his skin to his bones, then spread back from his bones to his skin. If an outsider had been present, they would have seen Jiang Li's entire body turn blue and purple, his lips blackened—hardly resembling a living person.  

**[Afflicted by Yin Energy Infusion: Wood Yin Infusion is active on self.]**  
**[Wood Yin Infusion: Loses 1 HP per second, all attributes reduced by 30%, Constitution attribute decreased. Duration: 12 hours.]** (－＋)  

This was the first time Jiang Li had seen a status effect measured in seconds—and a detrimental one at that. Losing one HP per second? No wonder ordinary mortals couldn’t withstand the Yin energy emanating from this cultivator’s graveyard.  

However, Jiang Li didn’t immediately dispel the effect or resist it with his internal energy. Instead, he focused his mind and began actively guiding the Yin energy into his body using the method described in the *Ghost Wood Art*.  

Wasn’t this the very reason he had secluded himself in bitter cultivation for over half a month?  

Though the current state was agonizing, absorbing the energy required no effort at all. The seed he had been visualizing in his mind was now taking shape at an unprecedented speed, becoming vivid, three-dimensional, and brimming with vitality!  

**[Ghost Wood Art (Qi Refining Chapter) LV0 → LV1]**  
**[Ghost Wood Art (Qi Refining Stage) LV1 learned. New profession "Qi Refining Cultivator" obtained. Replace primary profession?]**  

On his status panel, the level of the *Ghost Wood Art* silently updated, and a conspicuous prompt appeared. Without hesitation, Jiang Li selected "Yes," and his primary profession was instantly replaced.  

**[Name: Jiang Li]**  
**[Age: 13]**  
**[Race: Human]**  
**[Primary Profession: Qi Refining Cultivator, Stage: Early]**  
**[Secondary Profession 1: Martial Artist, Level: First-Class]**  

There was a distinct difference between primary and secondary professions. Based on past gaming experience, primary professions gained 20% more experience. But in reality, how this would manifest remained to be seen.  

After successfully entering the Qi Refining stage through the *Ghost Wood Art*, Jiang Li immediately noticed the difference. The bone-chilling numbness gradually receded, and his stiff body regained sensation.  

Now, far from feeling discomfort, he experienced a soothing warmth akin to a spring breeze.  

When he checked his status panel again, **[Wood Yin Infusion]** was still active.  

But the situation had changed entirely. What had once been a deadly poison to him was now an unparalleled tonic!  

**[Wood Yin Infusion: Cultivation speed of *Ghost Wood Art* increased by 300%. Duration: 2 hours.]** (－＋)  

The status had shifted from the debuff column to the buff column, and the effect was astonishingly beneficial. Without hesitation, he held down the plus sign for five seconds.  

**[Wood Yin Infusion: Cultivation speed of *Ghost Wood Art* increased by 300%. Duration: ∞]** (－)  

With this effect alone, his cultivation speed now rivaled that of a top-tier spiritual root—completely incomparable to before.  

Jiang Li didn’t open his eyes. Seizing the moment, he continued circulating his cultivation technique.  

Half an hour later, he completed a full cycle of Qi circulation, and a strand of pure Wood Yin spiritual energy flowed into his dantian. Only then did he withdraw from his meditative state, unable to suppress his joy.  

The moment he opened his eyes, he was startled—a greenish ghost flame hovered right in front of his face.  

Jiang Li stumbled back two steps before realizing there wasn’t just one ghost flame—there were at least a hundred, silently burning around him without emitting any heat. The scene was unnerving beyond words.  

It was like waking up to find a hundred burly men standing by your bed, smiling at you.  

"This place isn’t safe!"  

Having achieved his goal, Jiang Li hoisted the locust wood onto his shoulder and made a swift exit.  

This was sheer luck. The high mortality rate among the outer disciples of the Hidden Scripture Valley had created this graveyard—a place dense with Yin energy yet almost devoid of ghosts.  

It was practically tailor-made for his cultivation. Combined with the locust wood, it had allowed him to master the *Ghost Wood Art* and obtain a new cultivation-boosting status.  

"Now that I’ve entered the Qi Refining stage, I can start taking elixirs to aid my cultivation. That’ll make my progress even faster."  

"However, ordinary mid-grade spiritual root disciples usually take at least a month to reach this stage. My speed surpasses even most high-grade spiritual roots."  

"I’ll have to keep a low profile but also visit this graveyard more often. Otherwise, my rapid progress won’t make sense."  

Carrying the log, Jiang Li moved with newfound agility, his body much lighter than before.  

As a cultivator, his physique had undergone subtle changes. The Wood Yin spiritual energy in his dantian alone continuously replenished his strength, far surpassing the quality of his previous internal energy.  

"Just entering the Qi Refining stage already puts me on par with—or even above—peak mortal martial artists."  

"Cultivation and martial arts truly belong to different realms. Once I learn proper spells, even a Xiantian martial artist would be no match for me."

Returning to his dormitory in haste, Jiang Li placed the locust wood in his courtyard. The night was too dark for him to notice the fresh sprouts that had begun to emerge from the old tree.  

Back in his room, he first checked the clay pot by the window. Gently brushing aside the soil, he found the seed beneath showed no signs of sprouting. Unfazed, he watered it lightly before turning away.  

Sitting cross-legged on his meditation cushion, Jiang Li retrieved a porcelain vial from his robes—a bottle of Qi-Nourishing Pills to aid his cultivation.  

**[Consumed Qi-Nourishing Pill: Qi Nourishment is active on self.]**  
**[Qi Nourishment: Increases vitality, boosts Qi Refining cultivation speed by 50%. Duration: 2 hours.]** (－＋)  

Without pause, Jiang Li popped pill after pill into his mouth.  

Warm currents surged in his abdomen, his blood boiling so fiercely his face flushed red. The pure spiritual energy locked within the pills slowly dispersed, absorbed by his *Ghost Wood Art* and continuously strengthening the Wood Yin spiritual energy in his dantian.  

Only when his body felt bloated—like a balloon about to burst—did he stop.  

**[Overconsumption of Qi-Nourishing Pills: Accelerated Qi Nourishment is active on self.]**  
**[Accelerated Qi Nourishment: Increases vitality, boosts Qi Refining cultivation speed by 200%. Duration: 3 hours.]** (－＋)  

After holding the plus sign for five seconds—  

**[Accelerated Qi Nourishment: Increases vitality, boosts Qi Refining cultivation speed by 200%. Duration: ∞]** (－)  

Only now did Jiang Li realize how blissful cultivation could be. A steady stream of spiritual energy flowed into his dantian, his Wood Yin spiritual energy growing stronger by the moment. He could distinctly feel himself becoming more powerful with every passing second.  

A 500% increase in speed—was this how geniuses with supreme spiritual roots felt?  

Truly, the novels hadn’t lied. This sensation was even more exhilarating than… certain other activities. The idea that cultivators could seclude themselves for years or decades suddenly made sense—it was far from the tedious ordeal outsiders imagined.  

Unnoticed, time slipped away in the tranquility of cultivation.  

In Jiang Li’s mind, the visualized seed cracked slightly, revealing the faintest hint of a sprout.

One week later, in the outer sect’s grand lecture hall.  

The Teaching Elder stepped inside, paused, then smiled in satisfaction.  

"It seems some of you have already made a breakthrough!"  

"Let me see who they are."  

Picking up a name list, the elder scanned the seated disciples.  

"Yu Banxia, high-grade spiritual root. Very good—this shows you’ve been diligent."  

The praised Yu Banxia, always seated in the front row, puffed out his chest with pride.  

After a few words of encouragement, the elder’s gaze shifted toward Jiang Li.  

"Jiang Li… mid-grade spiritual root?"  

The Teaching Elder frowned.  

"Jiang Li, did you take pills prematurely?"  

His tone carried clear disapproval. A mid-grade spiritual root disciple breaking through to Qi Refining at this stage? His first thought was pill abuse.  

But in the very first lecture, he had explicitly forbidden mid- and high-grade spiritual root disciples from taking pills before Qi Refining entry—it would severely hinder their future potential!  

Only those with low-grade spiritual roots or worse, who struggled to enter Qi Refining without aid, were permitted to use pills.  

Now, believing Jiang Li had defied his teachings, the elder was displeased.  

"Elder, this disciple did not take pills prematurely. My breakthrough is entirely thanks to your guidance."  

Instead of arguing, Jiang Li began with flattery. He had no interest in escalating minor conflicts into grudges or life-and-death enmities.  

"Oh? From the start of your cultivation until now, it’s only been twenty-some days. Even the other high-grade spiritual root disciples haven’t broken through yet. Tell me, what guidance allowed you to surpass them so quickly?"  

The elder remained skeptical. If Jiang Li had a cultivation background—say, an elder setting up an array to assist him—that would be one thing.  

But Jiang Li’s background was clean, and he was just an ordinary outer disciple. What resources could he possibly have?  

"Elder, this disciple practices the *Ghost Wood Art*. In last week’s lecture, you mentioned..."  

Calmly, Jiang Li explained his methods—with slight omissions.  

Before he even finished, the elder’s frown had completely vanished.  

How could the elder not know about the outer sect’s mass graves? He had personally exterminated dozens of ghosts there.  

That locust wood was Yin-aligned—common knowledge in the cultivation world. Ordinary locust trees might take a century to become spirits, but planted in the outer sect’s graveyard? They’d turn malevolent in a decade.  

If Jiang Li cultivated the *Ghost Wood Art* there, his speed would naturally be… well, ghostly.
