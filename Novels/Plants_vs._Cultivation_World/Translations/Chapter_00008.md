# Chapter 8: Resource Support

Upon hearing Yao Shifeng's words, the four of them snapped out of their thoughts and turned their attention to him, waiting for him to continue.

After a moment, hesitation appeared on everyone's faces. The favor Yao Shifeng had asked of them was to borrow money—or more accurately, cultivation resources. His reasoning was simple: pooling their resources together to rapidly boost one person's cultivation first, after which that stronger individual would protect and assist the others.

The logic was sound, but cultivation resources were extremely precious for those with inferior spiritual roots like them. Without natural talent, they could only rely on resources to progress. If they gave up their resources, advancing would become exponentially harder. 

Moreover, why should Yao Shifeng be the one to receive the pooled resources instead of someone else? At the very least, Wu Jinfei, the second most talented among the five, had his own thoughts on the matter.

Seeing their hesitation, Yao Shifeng felt uneasy. He knew this was somewhat rushed, but with his plans disrupted, he had no choice but to take the risk. Yet, since no one outright refused, there was still room for negotiation.

Indeed, despite their hesitation, none of them intended to reject the proposal outright. Yao Shifeng's plan was undeniably practical. 

The world of cultivation was far from safe. Even within the sect, competition was fierce. As outer disciples with inferior spiritual roots, they were easy targets for bullying. But with a stronger cultivator's protection, many troubles could be avoided.

"Brother Yao, how about we each give you half of our resources?" Chu Feifei spoke up after exchanging glances with the others. "Without cultivation resources, we won't be able to progress. If we fail to reach the Qi Refining stage within a year, we'll be forcibly assigned to one of the obscure peaks."

"Deal!" Yao Shifeng nodded. This was already a favorable outcome. Asking them to hand over all their resources would have been unrealistic.

Without further delay, everyone took out three spirit stones. The cultivation resources they possessed were limited—three Qi Condensation Pills and three spirit stones each. 

If given the choice, they would naturally part with the spirit stones. While spirit stones had multiple uses—assisting cultivation, setting up formations, aiding in artifact refinement, and serving as currency—they paled in comparison to the immediate benefits of pills for cultivation.

Yao Shifeng wasn't surprised by their choice. He knew none of them had used their pills yet. Given their resource scarcity, they wouldn't consume them unless their progress stagnated.

However, spirit stones, being the universal currency of the cultivation world, could still be used to purchase other resources.

But when Gu Mo handed over his share, Yao Shifeng was taken aback. Instead of spirit stones, Gu Mo offered three Qi Condensation Pills.

With the Solar Essence at his disposal, Gu Mo had no need for pills. Spirit stones were far more valuable to him—the spiritual energy in his flowerpot was gradually depleting, and he would soon need to replace the stones. Losing his current stock was not an option.

"Brother Yao, how about I trade these three Qi Condensation Pills for three spirit stones?" Gu Mo calculated his needs. Securing three more stones would provide an extra safety net.

"Of course!" 

Yao Shifeng snapped out of his surprise and eagerly made the exchange. At this stage, pills were far more valuable than spirit stones.

"Everyone, I promise you this—your support today will be repaid many times over in the future." Yao Shifeng stood up solemnly after collecting the resources. 

This was the starting point of his rise. By leveraging the group's collective resources, he would gain an advantage in cultivation, allowing him to stay ahead step by step until he became a powerhouse envied by all.

Beyond mere words, Yao Shifeng also shared all the cultivation insights he had accumulated. Once everything was settled, they agreed to meet again in a month. 

The extended interval was because Yao Shifeng planned to focus entirely on cultivation, striving to break through to the Qi Refining stage as soon as possible.

"Gu Mo!"

Just as Gu Mo was about to leave, a voice called out to him—it was Chu Feifei. "You promised to exchange insights on the Cleansing Technique with me."

"Of course, I haven't forgotten!" 

Gu Mo smiled, then turned to the other two who were also preparing to leave. "Hu Hai, Wu Jinfei, would you like to join us?"

Both shook their heads. They had little interest in the Cleansing Technique. With half their cultivation resources gone, they needed to train even harder.

Undeterred, Gu Mo began explaining his insights on the technique to Chu Feifei. Given his mastery, guiding her was effortless. Under his instruction, Chu Feifei felt as if a veil had been lifted from her understanding.

At that moment, Gu Mo seemed shrouded in mystery to her. Though she hadn't mastered the technique yet, she had studied it for days. It was clear to her that Gu Mo's comprehension far surpassed that of a beginner.

"Gu Mo, thank you!" 

After digesting his teachings, Chu Feifei bowed deeply. In the cultivation world, imparting knowledge was an immense favor. It was no wonder Yao Shifeng had managed to secure half their resources after just a few days of sharing his insights.

It wasn't just the feasibility of his plan—it was also their gratitude for his guidance.

"Who knows? I might need your help next time." Gu Mo waved it off before they parted ways. Chu Feifei returned to practice the Cleansing Technique, now brimming with confidence thanks to his advice.

Meanwhile, Gu Mo resumed his own cultivation. In about two months, he too would step into the Qi Refining stage.

But half a month later, a major incident occurred. Fan Shaoming—the first outer disciple to reach Qi Refining—was ambushed and severely injured by an unknown assailant.

As rumors spread, more details emerged. Fan Shaoming's rapid progress had been due to a treasure in his possession—an artifact capable of gathering spiritual energy. 

Artifacts were far superior to ordinary magical tools. For an outer disciple, such a treasure was an irresistible temptation. Once exposed, it was only a matter of time before others coveted it.

Fan Shaoming's secret had been uncovered because his cultivation speed drew too much attention. A little investigation had revealed the truth, making the subsequent attack inevitable.

Had this happened outside the sect, the matter would have ended there. Killing for treasures was commonplace in the outside world. The fact that Fan Shaoming survived with only severe injuries was already fortunate.

But since this occurred within the sect, such an incident would not be allowed to pass quietly.
