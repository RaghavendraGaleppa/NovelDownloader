# Chapter 71: You Can Accomplish Great Things!

At the very moment Lu Yang reported to True Monarch Yinshan, Ancestor Yun, who was inside the secret realm, suddenly felt a tremor run through his body, as if a great calamity was about to befall him.

"...Is it your avatar?"

Ancestor Yun quickly performed a divination, instantly understanding the cause and effect. A trace of despair then appeared on his face: "Ultimately, this tribulation cannot be escaped."

His reincarnation this time heavily relied on secrecy. It was entirely due to the Sword Pavilion's Sect Master concealing the heavenly secrets that he hadn't been discovered. But once exposed, even the Sword Pavilion's Sect Master wouldn't be able to rescue him.

In other words, his final life-risking gamble had completely failed. The Sect Master's mission was incomplete, and there was no longer any hope of returning to Foundation Establishment. Furthermore, without him, the Yun family's status in the Sword Pavilion was bound to plummet, no longer a high and mighty Foundation Establishment immortal clan, perhaps even facing imminent demise.

"...No, there's still a chance!"

Ancestor Yun looked at Lu Yang, a terrifying killing intent suddenly appearing in his eyes. His hatred for Lu Yang was so profound that even the waters of three great rivers couldn't wash it clean.

The next second, a look of grim determination appeared on his face. With a thought, the Taiyi Golden Radiance that had been circling him rapidly rolled back, finally gathering entirely at his fingertip, transforming into a sharp sword qi.

This sword qi was a divine ability called "Fixing Primordial One Slash, Enduring with the World." Though the sword qi appeared unremarkable, it could actually directly lock onto an enemy's karma. Once the sword was unleashed, as long as the target's karma remained, the sword qi would not dissipate. In the past, the Witchghost Dao was completely annihilated by a Golden Core True Monarch, the Sect Master of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion of that generation, using this divine ability. Not a single person was left alive. Furthermore, because the Witchghost Dao had left behind a secret realm inheritance, its karma had not dispersed, so the sword qi also persisted for a thousand years.

However, this sword attack was not something ordinary cultivators could unleash. Because it involved karma, only Foundation Establishment cultivators could use it. And Ancestor Yun, having fallen from his Foundation Establishment realm, could only unleash this strike by sacrificing his own life.

In other words, at this moment, he intended to perish together with Lu Yang!

"With the 'Heaven-Scrutinizing Device' concealing the heavenly secrets, if I sacrifice my life to slay this devil and then reincarnate, perhaps there's still a sliver of hope to escape with my life—" Although he was already on his second reincarnation, forcefully initiating a third reincarnation before even returning to Foundation Establishment would cause severe damage to his cultivation. Even if he truly managed to escape, in the future he would inevitably be trapped by the 'mystery of the womb', becoming a mere mortal, never again achieving transcendence.

"...At least, I'll kill you first!"

Ancestor Yun stared intently at Lu Yang, then activated his divine ability. His entire essence, qi, and spirit rapidly disintegrated, all merging into the sharp sword qi he had condensed.

"Strike!"

With a furious roar, the sword qi howled forth, plummeting directly towards Lu Yang's location. Instantly, Lu Yang felt an intense sense of crisis.

"You want to fight me to the death?"

With a thought, Lu Yang's figure completely merged into the Saintly Form behind him. He then manipulated the Saintly Form to extend two heaven-reaching hands, grabbing towards the sword qi. The two became entangled. The Saintly Form's hands were shredded apart by the sword qi, bone and flesh separating. A large portion of the sword qi was also forcibly torn off by its hands. However, on the sword qi's side, as Lu Yang's karma remained undissipated, the sword qi immediately absorbed ambient energy to replenish itself, and the torn sword qi instantly returned to its original state.

On the other side, the Saintly Form was in a similar situation. After all, it was merely an manifestation conjured by Lu Yang using qi, not a true physical entity. As soon as he circulated his spiritual power, he immediately regenerated the damaged flesh and blood.

Thus, both sides fell into a stalemate.

Seeing this scene, Ancestor Yun sighed, but felt no lingering attachment. At this moment, he had lost his physical body, with only a wisp of his soul remaining in the world. Before the Saint Sect's True Monarch arrived, reincarnating as soon as possible was the best strategy.

Just then, Ancestor Yun suddenly felt a chill sweep through his heart. Looking back, he saw Lu Yang in the distance, smirking at him.

"Senior, why are you in such a hurry to leave?"

The next second, he saw a wisp of his own qi appearing in Lu Yang's hand. Lu Yang then drew a circular light, using the qi to project Ancestor Yun's image.

"...No!"

Ancestor Yun's pupils instantly constricted. Amidst his shock and fury, he was utterly baffled: "Profound Yin Soul-Seizing Great Art... How did he capture my qi?" The Profound Yin Soul-Seizing Great Art allowed one to kill enemies from a distance by merely capturing their qi. Ancestor Yun had long calculated that Lu Yang had learned this divine ability, so during their combat, he had been extremely careful to conceal his qi, absolutely not giving Lu Yang any chance to capture it. It should have been foolproof... But he hadn't expected that his qi would still be captured by Lu Yang! And in his current state, having lost his physical body and only retaining his soul, if this art struck him, he would likely be instantly scattered into oblivion, losing any chance of reincarnation!

"Heavenly Lord, save me!"

For a moment, Ancestor Yun had no choice but to postpone his reincarnation. Instead, in his soul form, he activated the 'Heaven-Scrutinizing Device', attempting to block Lu Yang's Profound Yin Soul-Seizing Great Art.

"Too late!"

Lu Yang waved his hand, severing Ancestor Yun's image within the circular light. Ancestor Yun immediately focused his spirit, preparing to counter.

Then, nothing happened.

Ancestor Yun blinked, stunned in place. The imagined remote curse-killing of the Profound Yin Soul-Seizing Great Art didn't appear; it was as if it were fake...

"...No!"

It *was* fake! He was stalling for time! Ancestor Yun suddenly awakened, daring not to linger any longer. With a wave of his hand, he opened a black passage, and his soul was about to rush into it.

However, at that very instant, a vast aura abruptly entered the Dharma Refinement Secret Realm!

"Seal the Heavens and Lock the Earth!"

Only a grand voice echoed inside and outside the secret realm, a golden proclamation. The black passage Ancestor Yun had just opened was instantly sealed back up.

"No—!!!"

The black passage was the gateway to reincarnation. Seeing this, Ancestor Yun instantly screamed, his soul violently trembling. He glared at Lu Yang with a ferocious expression: "You dared to trick me!?"

"What can you do to me?"

Lu Yang smiled faintly, then saw another large hand extend from outside the secret realm. It gently pinched the sword qi that had been endlessly entangled with him, instantly shattering it.

No matter how powerful a divine ability, against a higher cultivation realm, it was still utterly useless.

*This is Foundation Establishment, indeed.* Lu Yang sighed inwardly. Even though he had witnessed it many times, the crushing dominance of a Foundation Establishment True Monarch over a Qi Refinement cultivator still filled him with involuntary awe.

The next second, True Monarch Yinshan's figure appeared beside Lu Yang.

"Well done."

True Monarch Yinshan praised, then turned to look at Ancestor Yun's soul, laughing loudly: "So it's you, old fogey Yun Qingchuan!"

"Yinshan..."

Ancestor Yun's eyes darted, seemingly wanting to say something more, but before he could, True Monarch Yinshan raised a hand and struck his soul with a palm.

Boom!

The next second, all of Ancestor Yun's conscious thoughts were completely erased by True Monarch Yinshan, leaving only a blank soul held in True Monarch Yinshan's hand. After all, having fallen from the Foundation Establishment realm, even if his soul still retained a trace of its previous rank, it couldn't compare to a true Foundation Establishment True Monarch. Moreover, True Monarch Yinshan's cultivation had improved since the matter of Skeleton Mountain; he was now at the Mid Foundation Establishment stage, even less comparable to Ancestor Yun.

Buzz!

With Ancestor Yun dead and the Heaven-Scrutinizing Device now masterless, True Monarch Yinshan naturally didn't stand on ceremony. He immediately seized and suppressed it, taking it into his hand to examine.

"What a treasure, truly a magnificent treasure..."

Ancestor Yun had been able to conceal heavenly secrets with this artifact and reincarnate into the secret realm without detection, which showed its extremely high quality, even making True Monarch Yinshan's heart stir. However, this matter concerned the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, and it involved the soul of a Foundation Establishment True Monarch. According to sect rules, he had to report it to the Sect Master for a ruling. But once reported, this extraordinary treasure wouldn't remain hidden and would inevitably become a target for many. Given his current strength and status, he might not be able to keep it.

Just then, Lu Yang suddenly stepped forward and bowed.

"Senior Brother, your junior brother takes the liberty to ask for an impudent favor... Might I borrow the soul of that orthodox Foundation Establishment cultivator for a use? I guarantee to return it in its original state within ten years."

"Oh? You want this old fogey's soul?" True Monarch Yinshan raised an eyebrow, then shook his head: "You certainly dare to think big. However, this concerns the Sword Pavilion. Once I report it, the Sect Master will surely inquire, and then both this soul and the magical artifact cannot be kept."

"However... there isn't no way to bend the rules." At this point, True Monarch Yinshan suddenly changed his tone, looking at Lu Yang with a half-smile: "Many things, if left unreported, are but a trifle."

Lu Yang was momentarily stunned by these words, then revealed a puzzled expression: "Conceal what matter?"

"...Good! As expected of my Saint Sect disciple, you will accomplish great things!"

The two exchanged a look, an unspoken understanding passing between them.

The next second, True Monarch Yinshan tossed Ancestor Yun's soul into Lu Yang's hand, then put away the Heaven-Scrutinizing Device, before gracefully departing.
