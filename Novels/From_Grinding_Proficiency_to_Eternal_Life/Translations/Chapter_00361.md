# Chapter 361: Breakthrough, Land Immortal

In the next moment, it seemed as if only one sound remained in heaven and earth: the wailing of the dragon veins and the thunderous roar of the nation's fortune collapsing.

"Boom!"

There was no time to react. Six pillars of Xuanhuang Qi simultaneously poured into his body. The immense energy, like a raging tempest in a furious sea, washed through his four limbs and every bone.

As soon as it made contact, Xu Yunfan's skin cracked inch by inch, only to rapidly heal under the nourishment of the Xuanhuang Qi. His flesh and bones continuously重组, with every inch of his muscles shimmering with a jade-like luster.

His heart beat like a war drum, and with every pulse, it resonated with heaven and earth. Within a radius of three zhang around him, gravel and dust strangely floated up, as if time had frozen at this very moment.

In his vision, a massive amount of information regarding the Xuanhuang Qi strengthening his body popped up.

Until the final message...

*'You have successfully broken through the shackles of the Ninth Realm of Martial Arts and stepped into the Land Immortal Realm. Your body has been sublimated.'*

*'You have acquired a Martial Dao Divine Ability.'*

*'This world is flawed. Foundation Establishment failed...'*

Suddenly, a vertical crack appeared on his brow, and a golden light burst forth, like a third eye opening.

With his vision, the landscape of a thousand miles was fully visible. He saw the墨家机关兽 (Mo Family Mechanized Beasts) lurking beneath the quicksand of the Molan Dao, saw the ancient inscriptions on the bronze giant gate deep within the Ghost Cry Abyss of Lingnan, and even saw the surging hot magma within the underground mineral veins of the Xuanming Desert in the Western Regions.

"Land Immortal Realm..."

Xu Yunfan murmured, yet his voice was like a great bell, shaking the remaining walls of the training platform into crumbling dust.

At this moment, he seemed to no longer be an ordinary martial artist.

His true qi had completely materialized, transforming into liquid golden slurry flowing through his flesh and blood. With a mere lift of his hand or a movement of his foot, the energy of heaven and earth was at his command like a part of his body.

With a thought, a golden lotus bloomed under his feet. When the lotus petals unfurled, Buddhist chants and Taoist melodies echoed around him.

He flicked a finger, and a thread of true qi turned into a fine filament. It pierced through a barren mountain ten miles away in an instant. The mountain silently disintegrated into dust, yet the wild grass at its base remained completely unharmed.

Even more wondrous was that he sensed his soul could now leave his body and travel.

His spiritual sense spread out like a net, covering a radius of ten miles. With one thought, he could peer into people's hearts; with another, he could alter the weather.

He attempted to draw upon the power of heaven and earth. Immediately, wind and thunder gathered. Amidst the churning dark clouds, a purple lightning bolt struck down, but it condensed into a lightning pearl in his palm, as gentle as a pet.

"So that's how it is..."

Xu Yunfan's eyes were filled with joy.

The Land Immortal Realm had already transcended the shackles of martial arts.

He looked down at his own hands. His skin was as smooth and moist as jade, yet it contained enough power to shatter mountains.

Just then, a sudden change occurred!

Dugu Jiu, watching the battle from afar, had his pupils constrict violently. A tiny crack appeared on the rusty sword in his hand with a "crack" sound.

He muttered to himself, "The physical body becoming a sage, true qi communicating with the divine... This is no longer something human power can resist. The Land Immortal Realm?!"

Xu Yunfan closed his eyes, savoring the surging new power within his body, then suddenly opened them. A golden light blazed in his eyes.

He lightly lifted his right foot and took a step forward.

"Rumble!"

The entire training platform instantly collapsed three zhang, yet his figure had already appeared in the sky a thousand zhang high. The sea of clouds beneath his feet condensed automatically like a staircase.

He overlooked the vast earth and suddenly let out a long howl. The sound wave was like a dragon's roar, scattering the dark clouds for a hundred miles.

The moment sunlight poured down, all the martial artists inside and outside Yujing City couldn't help but look up at the figure in the high sky, their expressions filled with shock.

Could human power truly reach such a realm?!

At the summit of Qingwei Mountain, the sea of clouds churned.

The last wisp of Xuanhuang Qi from the Luotian Grand Altar merged into the Taoist Sect's fortune. The firmament suddenly tore open, and golden light cascaded down like a waterfall, enveloping the entire mountain peak.

The spiritual energy of heaven and earth, which had merely been rising from the earth's veins, was condensed by these wisps of Xuanhuang Qi. Guided by the rituals and ceremonies of the Luotian Grand Altar, it actually merged into the earth veins of Qingwei Mountain, transforming into a vibrant spiritual vein that surged once more. In the underground caves, dried-up springs gushed forth sweet spring water again.

Even the withered trees and grass, which had decayed due to the forced extraction of the Taoist Sect's fortune, now sprouted and regained vitality at a visible speed.

Bi Yuan stood in the center of the altar. His white hair moved without wind, and his turbid eyes reflected the golden glow filling the sky. He slowly raised his hand, feeling the surging true qi within him. The realm that had stagnated for many years actually loosened at this moment, taking a step forward.

"Heaven bestows sweet dew, the merit is complete..."

He muttered softly, his voice hoarse but carrying an unprecedented sense of relief.

Behind him, the elders and disciples of the Taoist Sect sat down cross-legged one after another, bathing in this gift from heaven and earth. Some broke through bottlenecks, some healed their injuries, and others took this opportunity to comprehend higher martial arts attainments.

The entire Qingwei Mountain seemed to have been injected with new life.

Bi Yuan looked toward the direction of Yujing City. His gaze pierced through thousands of miles of clouds and mist, as if seeing that figure standing on a golden lotus, looking down upon all living beings.

"Seven parts of Xuanhuang Qi entered him, three parts returned to my Taoist Sect..."

The corner of his mouth curled up, revealing a complex smile. "This time, my Taoist Sect has ultimately prevailed."

The神器 (Divine Instrument) of the nation should naturally be changed.

The Great Zhou Empress is dead, Xuanhuang has changed fate, and the national fortune has changed hands.

From this day forward, under the heavens, there is only the Taoist Sect!

Next, they must gather the power of the world to welcome the descent of the Heavenly Demon and stifle it from within.

He slowly raised his hand, waved his sleeve, and the runes on the altar lit up one by one. Finally, they transformed into a pillar of light that shot straight into the sky, stabilizing the unseen threads of fate.

As the Sect Master of the Taoist Sect, with countless threads of fate connected to him, he naturally could sense the subtleties.

"Pass down the order..."

Bi Yuan's voice was like a great bell, echoing in every corner of Qingwei Mountain. "From this day on, the Taoist Sect opens its gates to accept disciples and widely spreads the Taoist methods. All disciples of my Taoist Sect must take helping the world as their duty and protect all living beings!"

"Respectfully obeying the Sect Master's decree!" The disciples responded in unison, their voices shaking the nine heavens.

Inside Yujing City, Xu Yunfan slowly landed, standing with his hands behind his back. The Xuanhuang Qi around him had not yet dissipated, lingering like swimming dragons around the hems of his clothes, constantly being absorbed into his body to consolidate his foundation.

Even the dragon scale armor he wore, having been washed several times by the Xuanhuang Qi, became increasingly miraculous.

He raised his eyes to look at the shadows in the corner. A golden light swirled in his eyes, as if he could see through reality and illusion.

"Senior Dugu is quite at leisure."

His voice carried a hint of teasing, but not a trace of fatigue. For him, this battle was merely like snapping his fingers to crush an ant. He hadn't even fully stretched his muscles and bones, let alone that he had now broken through the shackles of the Ninth Realm and ascended to a higher level.

His strength compared to his former self was like the difference between clouds and mud.

The Heavenly Sword Dugu Jiu stepped out from the darkness, the wrinkles on his aged face trembling slightly.

He stared at the charred remains of the Spine Sword on the ground, his throat moving, and finally let out a long sigh. "This old man originally thought... at least blood would flow for ten miles."

He never expected the battle to end so quickly. Even though the Empress's vitality was withered, as the ruler of the Great Zhou, she naturally had many hidden assets, even wielding a staff made from the bones of a Land Immortal.

Yet she couldn't withstand three of Xu Yunfan's swords.

His thin fingers unconsciously stroked the scabbard. The sharpness that once dominated the martial world now turned into a self-mocking smile at the corner of his lips. "It seems even the qualification to watch the battle was granted by you."

"You flatter me, Senior."

Xu Yunfan's fingertips gently stroked the still-burning pure yang flames on the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace, his smile deepening. "Those three sword techniques just now were my ultimate moves."

(That's all for today, the follow-up is still being sorted out, the path to immortality will begin soon.)
