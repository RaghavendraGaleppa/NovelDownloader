# Chapter 35: Angry Fist, Farewell to My Brother

“Brother!”

Li Xiaofan suddenly shouted excitedly. Luo Fanghan’s hair stood on end as he circulated his internal energy to brace his shoulder and counter the force.

However, he was shocked to find that the hand gripping his shoulder was as firm as stone, and the internal energy behind it was incredibly potent. Two streams of internal energy wrestled covertly. But while Luo Fanghan’s hands were occupied holding Li Xiaofan, Li Xian—who had rushed over from behind—still had one hand free.

Li Xian clenched his fist, fueled by rage, and executed the move “Fist Stabilizes the Eight Directions.” This punch was heavy and solid; the moment it was thrown, peace was enforced in all directions.

Luo Fanghan’s scalp went numb. He turned his head abruptly, only to meet an iron fist head-on, taking the blow squarely.

*Bang!*

This punch was filled with killing intent, holding nothing back. Knowing he couldn't dodge, Luo Fanghan could only channel his internal energy to protect his face.

But Li Xian was fully prepared, whereas Luo Fanghan was hastily defending. The disparity between the two was vast. In an instant, his nasal bridge was crushed, and several teeth were knocked out.

His body was blasted away, plowing a trench several yards long in the snow.

Li Xian looked like a God of Slaughter, his face filled with killing intent. He helped his brother up and brushed the snow off him. “Xiaofan, are you alright?”

“I’ve caused you trouble, Brother,” Li Xiaofan said, hanging his head in shame.

“It’s not your fault,” Li Xian said coldly. He looked at Luo Fanghan with killing intent that he didn't bother to hide, like freezing needles.

Inside the One-Union Manor, D-rank guards patrolled in a linear fashion, while C-rank guards patrolled in “blocks.” Furthermore, C-rank guards had the authority to mobilize D-rank guards to a certain extent.

Hearing the commotion outside and receiving a report from a D-rank guard, Li Xian had immediately come to investigate. Seeing Luo Fanghan forcing his brother to sign a life-binding contract, his anger was impossible to contain.

“Pah!”

Luo Fanghan spat out a mouthful of blood and struck first: “Good, Li Xian! How dare you attack me, a steward, for the sake of an outsider?”

“Do you know this violates the Manor’s rules? You’ve abandoned your post without permission. I’m going to report this to Commander Pang!”

Li Xian said coldly, “I’m afraid not. This area falls under my patrol jurisdiction, not yours. Now... I am the one questioning you. You abandoned your post and disrupted the peace of the Manor.”

“You’re just a mere D-rank guard, how dare you be so arrogant!” Luo Fanghan raged, jumping in anger.

“D-rank?” Li Xian pulled out the “C” character token. “Open your dog eyes and take a good look. What is this token?”

Luo Fanghan focused his gaze. He was most familiar with this token—it was the C-rank Guard Token. He used to be a C-rank guard himself. His seniority was high, but he had never been able to advance further. After his blood and energy declined and his energy wasn't what it used to be, he had no choice but to step down from the guard position and take up the relatively idle job of a labor steward.

“You... you actually became a C-rank guard?!” Luo Fanghan’s eyes widened, revealing a look of horror.

His fierce aura was immediately suppressed.

“Uncle-in-law, don’t listen to his nonsense! He’s only been a guard for a short time; it’s impossible for him to be a C-rank guard!” Bi Hao couldn't hide his jealousy and screamed hysterically.

“Shut up!” Luo Fanghan scolded him.

“Correct, I am already a C-rank guard,” Li Xian said coldly. “You lot are laborers, yet you aren't doing your work. You’ve disrupted the Manor’s regulations. According to the Manor rules, I have the right to punish you.”

Before the words had fully faded, Li Xian took a step forward and struck first to punish Bi Hao. He sent a stream of internal energy into the spot where Bi Hao was already injured.

Martial artists feared internal energy entering their bodies and being unable to dissolve it far more than external injuries. This would cause the injury to relapse and lead to serious chronic ailments.

Li Xian flashed past the others, his hands clamping onto the shoulders of the other laborers. With a forceful twist, the sound of bones shattering echoed.

For every laborer who had participated, whichever hand had touched Li Xiaofan had that hand twisted and broken.

“Steward Luo... save... save us,” those laborers cried out in terror, looking to Luo Fanghan for help.

But they saw Luo Fanghan’s face shifting between light and dark; how could he speak up for them?

“Damn it, how did this kid become a C-rank guard so quickly?”

“This is too fast. I struggled for six years just to touch the threshold of being a C-rank guard, but he did it in just over a month. Just over a month!”

Luo Fanghan didn't know if it was from the cold or fear, but his body trembled uncontrollably.

After Li Xian had dealt with all the irrelevant people, he slowly walked toward Luo Fanghan. “Steward Luo, last time you sought me for a spar, I didn't agree. This time... I am seeking you for a spar. Do you dare accept?”

“This... this...”

Luo Fanghan didn't answer, but his courage had already failed him.

He had enjoyed comfort for a long time. Although he hadn't neglected his martial arts, he couldn't stop the loss of his blood and energy. Although his many years of experience meant he might not necessarily lose, the fist ultimately fears the young and strong...

Once a fight started, no matter the outcome, he wouldn't gain anything.

He suddenly came to his senses. The last time they met, he had the confidence to win. In just these few days, the situation had changed so drastically.

“Silence implies consent!”

Li Xian kicked the snow. With a *whoosh*, snowflakes splashed everywhere. Luo Fanghan’s heart shuddered, and his vision was blurred by the snow.

*Bang!*

A heavy blow struck the back of his head immediately, nearly sending him tumbling. He roared, “You’re going too far, kid! Do you really think I’m afraid of you?” He spun around and threw a punch.

But he hit nothing but air. At that moment, he heard the whistling of a fist from his right. He quickly raised his hand to block, but instead, a pain shot through his groin as he was kicked by a rising kick.

“Ouch!” Luo Fanghan wailed in agony.

“A martial artist’s duel... should make reasonable use of the terrain to increase one's own advantages!”

Although Li Xian was angry, he wasn't blinded by it. He was confident, but never arrogant.

Every few punches, he would sweep his leg, sending the snow on the ground flying to block both parties' vision. Although Li Xian’s vision was also restricted, he had the advantage when executing the “Four Directions Fist.” His movements became even more unpredictable.

“Enough!”

After more than ten exchanges, a loud shout suddenly rang out, and the suspended snowflakes were blown away.

It was Pang Long.

Pang Long was still more than forty yards away. With just a shout full of energy, it was like a strong wind blowing in, sweeping away the snow.

Li Xian was secretly amazed, thinking: “Commander Pang’s cultivation is profound. The sheer volume of his internal energy is truly unimaginable!”

“Com... Commander Pang,” Luo Fanghan said. He was beaten to a bruised and swollen face, hunched over, clutching his lower half, his eyes filled with tears of pain.

He felt a wave of relief. This kid’s attacks were too ruthless. If Pang Long hadn't come, he might have actually been beaten to death.

“I have already been informed of this matter. No one needs to explain. Let this end here,” Pang Long said as soon as he arrived, delivering his verdict.

He then looked deeply at Li Xian: “I grant you a day’s leave to accompany your brother.”

Li Xian glanced coldly at Luo Fanghan. Seeing that the matter had come to this, he had no choice but to let it go for now. “Alright, I will obey Commander Pang’s arrangement.”

“Brother, the Winter Exam is approaching. I have to go with the team to Huangtian County.”

Seeing his brother, Li Xiaofan was naturally delighted. His eyes were full of admiration; his brother seemed to be very powerful now. The bad guys couldn't bully them brothers anymore.

“Work hard,” Li Xian smiled easily, gently stroking his brother’s head. “It’s okay if you don’t pass. My situation is better now, so I can take care of you.”

“By the way.”

Li Xian took a pouch from his chest. “There are over three hundred coins in here. Keep them safe. If you need anything, use them. Don’t save them.”

“As the saying goes, people rely on clothes and horses rely on saddles. When you go to the exam, throw away your old clothes and let the clothes inside show, so you won't be laughed at.”

Li Xian sighed deeply. “Once we brothers make it big, it would be great to buy a proper house in the county, with a plot of land. Mom died early, wasn't she hoping for this?”

“Brother...” Li Xiaofan was extremely reluctant to part ways at the moment of separation. His eyes were somewhat moist, but he didn't want to worry his brother, so he pretended to be proud.

“Brother, if I happen to pass the exams all the way and become the Grand Champion, I’ll buy you a big mansion in the Capital.”

“Hahaha,” Li Xian laughed. “It’s a deal. Having a champion brother will surely be very glorious.”

The two brothers chatted for a while longer. Seeing it was getting late, Li Xiaofan had to hurry back.

In the snowstorm, that thin, small figure walked further and further away.

Sometimes Li Xiaofan’s eyes were blurred by the snow, and he couldn't tell the direction, so he looked back. As long as he saw Li Xian’s figure, the direction became clear, and he walked faster.

Li Xian watched his back, seeing him off. His heart was filled with worry and reluctance. With his brother taking this step, the care Li Xian could offer would be much less.
