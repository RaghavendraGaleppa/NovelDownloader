# Chapter 226: Have You Ever Seen a Dragon? (1/2)

Night had fallen.

Inside the private room, the lamplight was dim. The candlelight filtering through the glass lantern cast a hazy, soft glow, making the room feel so enclosed that even moonlight seemed unable to penetrate it.

"Take off your shoes."

Li Mo sat on a small wooden stool, looking seriously at Ying Bing, who was reclining on the massage chair. He hoped to repay the "Ice Cube" for her hard work earlier, and at the same time... see if he could get another round of investment.

As for why he was sitting on a small stool...

"Take off my shoes... for what?"

Although Ying Bing's jade-like face remained as cool and indifferent as ever, her slender, fair hands had already gripped the fabric covering the massage chair tightly.

"Have you ever seen a dragon?"

Li Mo asked solemnly.

"I have."

Ying Bing nodded.

Li Mo: "......."

Did she see one in her past life or in a dream?

This response completely threw him off.

Catching his momentary speechlessness, Ying Bing tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear. "Oh, then I haven't."

"Alright, you're about to."

Li Mo maintained a mysterious expression.

Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed slightly, a small question mark seemingly floating above her head.

Li Mo: "Because you're about to enjoy the 'Dragon-Tail Service'."

Ying Bing didn't quite understand what this莫名其妙 (outlandish) adjective meant.

But Li Mo said this was a service the tavern was about to offer its guests.

If it's for guests, it should... be relatively normal.

Besides, it had something to do with dragons.

Dragons don't even exist among the ten thousand beasts of the Southern Frontier anymore; it's a solemn and dignified character, often used by the imperial family.

Li Mo added, "If you feel it's inappropriate or uncomfortable, tell me at any time."

The young man was in high spirits. He didn't know why he was so enthusiastic.

"Add something?"

"Add?"

"Forget it, let's add some Lotus Seed Wine for you. The effect will be better."

He poured the Snow Lotus Wine, which wouldn't be easily bought even for a thousand taels of silver, into the basin. Even though the water would be dumped later, he didn't feel it was a waste.

But he soon changed his mind.

Her long, slender calves, fairer than snow and whiter than frost, with nails like cardamom seeds slightly curled, tested the water temperature before she finally placed her feet inside.

"Mm..."

"What's wrong?"

Ying Bing found that Little Li had fallen into deep thought.

Li Mo was thinking that this water would be dumped later, and for some reason, he felt a bit heartbroken.

Hmm, it must be because of the high-quality wine added to it, which helps relax muscles and improve circulation...

"Then I'll... start. You need to relax."

"Mm."

Ying Bing turned her face to the side, saying nothing.

Li Mo discovered that although the Ice Cube's face maintained its usual indifference, whenever she got nervous, her fingers and toes would involuntably curl up.

This was a truth he had observed after getting to know her.

It was just a guess before, after all, practice is the only standard for testing truth!

A moment later.

"Are you done?"

"I haven't even started yet."

"But you've... been rubbing for a long time."

"Impossible, it must be that you feel the seconds dragging on."

"....."

Li Mo was using the techniques of the "Plucking Flowers" finger skill, but how should he put it...

Perhaps this was the game between a technician and a customer.

The more indifferent the Ice Cube's expression, the more Little Li wanted to find her pressure points.

So he found a rather sensitive acupoint and pressed down with a *splat*.

Hmm...

Fortunately, his reflexes were sharp.

Otherwise, that water-dripping, white jade-like foot would have almost ended up in his mouth.

Then, looking up, Li Mo saw written in her clear, deep eyes:

*Not amused.*

So Little Li behaved himself.

But seriously, no kidding.

The person who created the "Plucking Flowers" finger skill was truly a genius. Even after removing the core part, its effectiveness was still outstanding.

And did Little Li take it seriously?

Anyway, from the customer Ice Cube's perspective, Little Li himself was enjoying it.

In any case.

Ying Bing's tense body gradually relaxed.

But that annoying system not only never fails to show up, it's never late either.

[Ding-dong—]

[Time until the next ranking comparison: one minute countdown.]

The system's virtual text seemed to overlap perfectly with Little Li's figure.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes to look at him, her eyelashes, tinged with a strange luster, trembling slightly.

---

She didn't have the same confidence as the previous two times.

She had lost both times before. Although she had also mastered a divine skill now, what exactly was that technique Li Mo just used?

"You seem to go to the top of the Sword Pavilion quite often?"

Li Mo was seriously using the techniques of the "Plucking Flowers" finger skill, but talking to Ying Bing didn't distract him; after all, his hands now had a mind of their own.

"Yeah, I was thinking of copying that strange stone, but I never succeeded. I did make some progress, though..."

"Copying the strange stone... for what?"

"Something so miraculous, what if it's a Divine Form of the Great Dao?"

Li Mo smiled.

Ying Bing just thought he was joking: "You can't paint a Divine Form of the Great Dao right now."

She had never heard of a Divine Form of the Great Dao being copied.

The most powerful painting sage she knew of could only copy Extreme Forms, and that required favorable timing, terrain, and human conditions.

Usually, the inheritance of an Extreme Form is achieved by a powerful expert separating a part of their soul essence at a great cost to form a Divine Intent Mark.

Ying Bing didn't find it strange that Li Mo could comprehend two Divine Intents.

Usually, a cultivator at the Divine Observation Realm would be considered good if they could fully comprehend one Divine Intent. Some only comprehend the Lower Form.

However, she herself was on the path of observing the Extreme Forms of a hundred birds to condense the Phoenix Divine Form.

"If you want to comprehend other Divine Intents, you should find one that suits your constitution."

"But I don't know what my constitution is specifically suited for."

Li Mo shrugged.

He only felt that the ones he drew himself were a match.

"It can't possibly be a stone."

"What if a monkey jumps out of the stone?"

"You..."

Ying Bing's cold gaze suddenly froze.

Her line of sight moved downward, landing on the hand on her calf.

As they were chatting...

When did his hand get there?

Li Mo maintained a professional expression and cleared his throat:

"Let me know if you feel uncomfortable."

"Now..."

Ying Bing's lips parted slightly.

But the countdown was ticking away, about to reach zero.

3...

2...

1...

[The results of the third Eastern Wilderness Domain's prodigy ranking have been announced.]

[Congratulations, Host, for achieving second place in this prodigy ranking.]

[Reward is being issued...]

[Detected that the Host has activated the Loser's Punishment. All rewards are stored in the system space and will be issued after the punishment mechanism is completed.]

[This punishment's content is: Request 'Li Mo' to touch you.]

[Requirement: Over 80% of your total body surface area.]

Ying Bing bit her lip, momentarily dazed.

It was unexpected, yet it made sense.

Perhaps deep down, she had already prepared herself for this possibility?

The air seemed to fall silent for a moment.

Li Mo suddenly felt the smooth arch of her foot tense up, and her relaxed leg became nervous again.

*Hmm...*

To be honest, it's not a matter of whether the Ice Cube can adapt to it anymore.

Little Li felt that he should also calm down and take a cold shower or something.

It's a bit hard to bear.

However, the investment feedback hadn't been triggered yet. Was it because this investment wasn't complete, or did this not count as an investment behavior?

"It's normal to be unaccustomed to a 'Dragon-Tail Service' the first time."

"Let's stop here for now."

However, just as he shook the water droplets off his hand and stood up, Ying Bing's soft voice came from behind him. She seemed to be making a great effort to maintain her composure.

"Didn't you say... I could see a dragon?"

"What dragon?"

"The dragon from the Dragon-Tail Service."

"???"

Li Mo turned around, confused.

Her face, which should have been like a cold, clear moon or frost, now seemed to have transformed into a moonlight reflection on a lake, shimmering with faint ripples.

It must be a problem with the lighting.
