Chapter 301: The First!

The training grounds were plunged into dead silence.

"A Qi Refining Realm cultivator... fighting a Body Tempering Realm expert head-on?"

A disciple of the Xuanxiao Peak muttered to himself, his long sword clattering to the ground.

He had cultivated the sword for twenty years, priding himself on his talent, yet at this moment, even the courage to hold his sword had been crushed.

"How is this possible..."

The heir of the Qingming Peak's pupils constricted violently, his fingernails digging deep into his palm.

This Body Tempering Grand Master had planned to wait until Xu Yunfan exhausted his strength before making a move. However, not only had the opponent's vital energy not faded, it had instead surged, even showing signs of rising further.

Such subversive combat power sent a chill, unprecedented in his heart, surging through him.

On the high platform, Vice Sect Master Shen Wuya could no longer maintain his faint, ambiguous smile. His eyes were fixed on Xu Yunfan with a profound, inscrutable gaze.

As a Grand Master of the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining, he naturally saw the embryonic form of the "Ten Thousand Laws Return to the Stream" contained within Xu Yunfan's strike.

It gathered the top martial arts of various sects into one body.

"Does he intend to walk the path of the Sword Sovereign, the Lonely Nine?"

Shen Wuya lowered his eyelids, his expression thoughtful.

Back then, the Sword Sovereign Lonely Nine possessed talent that shocked the world. Relying on the effects of the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Technique to reshape his body, he forcibly plundered the top cultivation methods of the other five major sects, practiced the Ten Thousand Laws Return to the Stream, transformed into the Sword of Heaven, and suppressed the contemporaries, fighting the top experts of the six major sects single-handedly without falling behind.

"This child... is he truly from the Tiangong Cave?" Purple Realm Taoist's beard and hair trembled slightly, the whisk in his hand moving without wind.

He had cultivated the Purple Cloud Primordial Skill of the Flowing Cloud Peak for over a hundred years. Although he had yet to grasp its essence to condense true qi and enter the Ninth Realm, he considered his eyesight profound. He could see that when Xu Yunfan withdrew the Dragon Tiger Hibernation Breath Technique, the mixed internal arts within his body actually fused perfectly, even nourishing the pure yang true qi. It was simply不可思议 (unthinkable).

The Head of the Punishment Hall, Cui Yu, remained silent for a long time before finally speaking in a hoarse voice: "Xu Yunfan, victory."

With these four words, the entire crowd erupted in an uproar.

His complex gaze swept over Bi Yuan, only to see the Sect Master with a smile at the corner of his mouth, a spark of hope burning in his eyes.

It seemed... he saw hope...

But wasn't the Dao Sect strong enough already? Why would the Sect Master reveal such a joyful expression?

At this moment, the entire Dao Sect had no more doubts, looking at him almost like a celestial being.

The thirty-six consecutive duels allowed Xu Yunfan to become famous in a single battle, implicitly achieving the position of the number one among the Dao Sect's youth.

A Qi Refining Realm cultivator suppressing a Body Tempering Realm expert to become the first was truly a feat that shocked the world.

The Peak Masters who had secretly colluded turned pale with anger, while the younger disciples stared intently at Xu Yunfan, their eyes filled with both awe and an unextinguished fighting spirit.

Because the mountain pressing down on their heads was a Qi Refining Realm cultivator who had only joined the sect for just over two months!

---

Seven days had passed since Xu Yunfan stepped onto the thirty-six consecutive dueling stage. After Chu Cangming stepped up and fought him, Xu Yunfan emerged victorious, and no one else dared to challenge him. He naturally won.

On this day.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on the Xuan Jade Platform at the peak of Qingwei Mountain, his vital energy and blood flowing like mercury, slowly boiling as the Meridian Cleansing Bone Marrow Skill circulated.

His eyes were slightly closed. The bones within his body emitted a faint "jade bone resonance," and the strength flowing through his flesh and blood surged like rivers and streams, scouring every corner.

'You diligently cultivate the Meridian Cleansing Bone Marrow Skill, receiving the medicinal power of the Ginseng King, aided by the Dragon Tiger Harmonizing Pill. Proficiency +1'

'You...'

As proficiency prompts flashed across his vision, Xu Yunfan's emotions remained unmoved. He focused entirely on guiding the blood and strength within his body, following the extremely complex circulation path of the Meridian Cleansing Bone Marrow Skill to form a complex great cycle throughout his body.

Every time it circulated, a section of bone marrow deep within his bones would be slowly assimilated by golden marrow.

Since the battle on the thirty-six consecutive duels, he knew well that his strength was still insufficient. The ability to fight Chu Cangming and win was entirely due to him possessing the Dragon Scale Armor and the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace, two divine weapons.

If he were to take off the armor and Chu Cangming were to put down the divine weapon, and they fought bare-handed, Xu Yunfan would have to use the Lin Character Mantra, entering the Lin State, disregarding the burden on his body, and even suppressing his own potential, constantly breaking through his limits to fight for a sliver of life, and look for an opportunity to win.

At this moment, he guided the pure yang true qi of the Pure Yang One Qi Skill to blend with the cleansing power of the Meridian Cleansing Bone Marrow Skill. The dragon spine trembled section by section, actually condensing a faint golden film of strength on the surface of his body.

It won't be long now!

Xu Yunfan glanced at the attribute panel. The proficiency of the Meridian Cleansing Bone Marrow Skill in the skill column had reached 832 points. At most, half a month was needed to reach the Great Perfection at 1000 proficiency.

Once the Meridian Cleansing Bone Marrow Skill reaches Great Perfection, he could begin cultivating the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Technique, with strength entering the organs, vital energy forming a shield, and stepping into the realm of a Body Tempering Grand Master.

Even within the Dao Sect, this would absolutely be considered a high-level position.

Of the thirty-six peaks of the Dao Sect, only the first five peaks had Peak Masters who achieved the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining. The Peak Masters of the other peaks were merely Body Tempering Grand Masters.

With the Dao Sect providing spiritual pills and miraculous medicines without regard for cost, Xu Yunfan naturally would not waste them.

Suppressing the thoughts rising in his heart, Xu Yunfan continued to move his blood and vital energy, cultivating the Meridian Cleansing Bone Marrow Skill.

Three hours later, Xu Yunfan suddenly opened his eyes, exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, and his aura rose sharply.

The pores all over his body relaxed, expelling foul, black impurities. His skin became as jade, translucent with light, and a faint thunderous sound echoed deep within his bone marrow.

Just at this moment, Qing Song hurried over holding a medicine box, followed by several Dao Sect laborers carrying a bronze medicinal cauldron. Inside, the Eight Treasures Cleansing Heaven Soup was steaming, with hidden radiance appearing.

Before the medicine box was even opened, a refreshing and heart-stirring exotic fragrance had already diffused, making one's blood and vital energy surge and bones go numb upon smelling it.

"Senior Brother Xu..."

Qing Song bowed respectfully, his eyes unable to hide his envy. "The Sect Master specifically instructed that an extra dose of pills be added for you tonight."

He carefully opened the medicine box, revealing a purple-gold pill the size of a dragon's eye inside. Its surface was densely covered with lightning patterns, and faint electric currents flowed within.

"This is the 'Purple Gold Forging Bone Pill.' It uses the essence blood of a beast born with natural lightning as a guide, supplemented by thirty-six types of spiritual herbs to refine. The entire Dao Sect's inventory is no more than three pills."

Xu Yunfan's gaze sharpened, well aware of the preciousness of this pill.

He was just about to speak when he suddenly heard light footsteps coming from outside the courtyard, accompanied by the crisp and pleasant sound of bells.

"Junior Brother, don't辜负 (let down) the Sect Master's good intentions."

Two beautiful figures, one in green and one in red, arrived gracefully.

Senior Sister Qing Luan wore a plain white Taoist robe, her hair pinned up with a jade hairpin, her气质 (temperament) as cold as the moon. Senior Sister Chi Shao wore a red dress like fire, a string of silver bells hanging at her waist, her smile as bright as the morning sun.

Senior Sister Qing Luan raised her fair hand, her fingertips glowing with a faint green light: "This 'Purple Gold Forging Bone Pill' has a domineering药性 (medicinal property). It needs to be guided by our Dao Sect's secret 'Nine Revolutions Pushing Palace Hand' to harmonize the qi impact. Otherwise, it's easy to damage the blood and vital energy."

Her tone was calm, but it allowed no refusal.

Senior Sister Chi Shao blinked and said with a playful smile: "Little Junior Brother, the Sect Master is afraid you are young and impulsive and can't withstand the dryness and violence of this pill, so he specifically sent the two of us to 'guard' you."

She emphasized the word "guard," making Senior Sister Qing Luan cough lightly.

Xu Yunfan naturally did not refuse and smiled as he accepted, cupping his hands: "Thank you, two Senior Sisters. You specially came here personally late at night..."
