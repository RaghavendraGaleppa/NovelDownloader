# Chapter 626: The Cultivation System of Incense and Prayers

Her face was breathtakingly beautiful, making it hard to believe this was a stone statue. Perhaps it was due to the so-called divinity of this world; the statue's visage seemed to surpass the limits of mortal imagination.

Her features were deep and harmonious, carrying a distinct exotic charm that differed from the mainland's mainstream aesthetics. Her forehead was smooth and full, her nose straight as if carved by a knife, and her lips were slightly pursed, the corners of her mouth seeming to hold a faint, ambiguous smile that was neither sorrowful nor joyful.

This beauty did not belong to the mortal world; it was detached and noble, the manifestation of perfect divinity in the hearts of believers.

She tilted her head slightly and lowered her gaze, her eyes seeming to pierce through the cold stone, gazing at every believer who entered the church, or perhaps listening to the whispers of the unseen.

Most striking was the posture of her hands.

She held an exquisitely crafted instrument. It had a harp-like main frame, but its strings were not distinct and separate; instead, they flowed upwards into the mid-air, converging to form a sculptural image resembling a "Listening Horn" or a "Sound Wave Vortex." It cleverly combined the "expression of song and praise" with the "capture of listening," perfectly condensing her dual divine roles into this static image.

Xu Yunfan stopped a few steps before the altar.

Squinting his eyes, he looked at the statue with great interest. It was a masterpiece of art, no matter where it was placed.

It wasn't out of admiration, but a pure, slightly critical appreciation.

*'The craftsmanship of the person who carved this is quite good, to give stone such a sense of rhythm...'* he thought to himself, his gaze naturally sweeping over the statue's smooth body lines.

*'Hmm, they also knew how to capture the key points. Where it should be slender, it is slender; where it should be full, it is full... This figure's proportions are top-notch even among mortals.'*

He admitted that this divine statue was indeed impossibly beautiful, especially with that deep and mysterious exotic temperament, which added a touch of novelty.

It wasn't boring to come all this way just to see it.

Most importantly, it seemed to have been endowed with a quality of immortality. Although similar to the Immortal Gold Nature condensed at the Foundation Establishment perfection stage, it seemed to be bestowed by this world's Heavenly Dao rather than refined by oneself.

This made the statue similar to an animated spirit of the Incense and Divine Path.

"This world is quite interesting," Zhang Ziyang, who had been inside the Star Spirit Banner all along, spoke up at the right moment.

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly.

"Master, do you think this world is good?"

Zhang Ziyang said, "This Great World is marvelous. This divine statue is condensed with Incense and Prayers, and its cultivation system is quite profound."

Zhang Ziyang had not been idle all these years. With Xu Yunfan's massive contribution points, he had exchanged for a great number of scriptures within the Primordial Origin Sect. Combined with what Xu Yunfan had "found" outside, one could say he had become a learned and erudite scholar.

He had continuously innovated his Divine Travel Dharmakaya and Mystic Spirit Transformation Divine Dao, gaining profound insights and comprehension of the Incense and Divine Path.

Zhang Ziyang continued, "From just this divine statue, this world's cultivation system is indeed unique. After Foundation Establishment, one can rely on faith and prayers to condense Immortal Gold Nature, thereby ascending to the so-called Divine Throne."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred. "Master, do you wish to study in this world?"

Zhang Ziyang did not deny it and nodded slightly. "I find this world quite suitable for me."

Xu Yunfan said, "Then I will find an opportunity later to rebuild a physical body for you."

Hearing this, Zhang Ziyang was quite moved and emotional.

"Yunfan, it is truly not easy for you to maintain a certain level of your original heart in an environment like the Primordial Origin Sect."

Xu Yunfan laughed. "Master has helped me a great deal over the years. What harm is there in me helping you in return?"

Logically speaking, although Xu Yunfan's tone was confident when he said this, he felt a bit guilty in his heart.

After all, when Zhang Ziyang first entered the banner, although Xu Yunfan had not placed any restrictions, the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi cultivated through his attribute panel had an almost unbelievable level of control over magic treasures.

Zhang Ziyang, who had become a banner spirit, had long been subtly influenced by an invisible power of indoctrination, changing his subconscious.

Although Zhang Ziyang could not perceive it, if he ever harbored thoughts of harming Xu Yunfan, Xu Yunfan would be the first to know.

Otherwise, Xu Yunfan would not have agreed so readily.

Surviving in the Primordial Origin Sect all these years, although most of the time was spent in seclusion on the Divine Thunder Peak, one cannot just stay indoors; one must go out to purchase things occasionally.

One cannot easily trust anyone.

The path of cultivation is, by nature, a solitary journey.

It was just that Zhang Ziyang was unaware of this.

Just as his gaze, filled with a hint of casual amusement, lingered on that perfect stone-carved face for a moment.

The originally half-lowered, frozen eyes of the statue lifted an imperceptible fraction.

The feeling was extremely诡异 (strange), as if a figure in a fine painting had slightly moved their eyes.

Xu Yunfan's eyes narrowed sharply.

It was not an illusion.

The light at the top of the altar had subtly changed at some unknown time. The movement of a shadow line happened to pass over the statue's pupils, creating an illusion similar to "pupil constriction."

But he could clearly feel an extremely weak yet incredibly solid gaze, like a tangible, icy needle, shooting out from the statue's bottomless eyes. It was precise, instantly crossing the distance and piercing him.

*Hiss...*

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred, but he was not afraid.

In an instant, the sandalwood smoke swirling in the church stopped drifting, and the flames burning on the candlesticks in the corner stalled for half a breath.

The statue was looking at him.

A cold, rebuking gaze instantly pierced the unique quiet dust and incense scent of the church, stabbing into Xu Yunfan's eyes.

The statue's originally carved deep and moving eyes now shimmered with a strange crystalline luster. It was no illusion; they were locked onto him, carrying a coldness and anger akin to a god gazing upon an ant.

She felt a gaze that had violated her.

But the amused curve at the corner of Xu Yunfan's lips did not change in the slightest; instead, it deepened a bit.

He did not immediately look up to meet those now-demonic eyes. His gaze seemed to still be停留在 (lingering on) the exquisitely carved instrument in the divine statue's hands.

A creation somewhat like a combination of a lute and a harp.

Aetela. According to the legends of this world, this is an ancient and vast fantasy world.

Beneath the sky, deities are as numerous as the grains of sand on the Ganges.

This world has ancient and vast pantheons, such as the Divine Court of Light that governs glorious order and the hymns of life, its brilliance covering myriad nations.

There is also the Dark Church hidden in the abyssal shadows, weaving conspiracies and feeding on fear.

The Natural Heart Pantheon, which reveres primal life force and the balance of all things, uses forests and wilderness as its temples.

Besides these three prominent pantheons, there are countless deities wandering outside, with诡谲 (surreal) natures.

Those who govern dreams and misfortune, those who preside over a specific craft, and even those who favor the growth of a rare type of fungus...

The dominions of Aetela are fragmented and vast. It is said there are tens of thousands of them, jointly managing the rules and the trajectories of all living beings in this world.
