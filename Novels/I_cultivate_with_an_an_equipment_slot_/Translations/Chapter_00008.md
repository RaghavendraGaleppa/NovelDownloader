# Chapter 8: Spirit Devouring Flower and Rewards  

Cultivation knows no calendar, and years pass unnoticed.  

In the blink of an eye, seven days had gone by.  

Though Zhang Yan had reached the Qi Refining stage and become a cultivator, he still hadn’t abandoned his work in the spirit fields. Each day, he toiled under the sun and cultivated at night—a simple and frugal life, yet peaceful and content.  

Over these past few days, Old Lin had witnessed Zhang Yan’s terrifying talent firsthand.  

He knew Zhang Yan had learned the Wood Essence Technique from the Enlightenment Peak. The Wood Essence Technique was a common spell among spirit plant cultivators, but the level of mastery varied depending on one’s comprehension.  

Old Lin had also practiced the Wood Essence Technique.  

It had taken him a full three years to barely reach the Minor Achievement stage.  

Yet now, he stood dumbfounded as he watched Zhang Yan.  

With a mere flick of his fingers, Zhang Yan summoned a wisp of emerald-green light. The moment it touched a stalk of spirit rice, the plant visibly grew taller, and its already mature grains plumped up further.  

**Minor Achievement in the Wood Essence Technique!**  

Old Lin could hardly believe his eyes.  

**Seven days.**  

That was all it had taken Zhang Yan to reach Minor Achievement.  

Three years versus seven days—the sheer disparity left Old Lin speechless.  

"Y-you’ve already reached Minor Achievement in the Wood Essence Technique?" Old Lin’s voice trembled slightly as he spoke.  

"Indeed. It seems I have some talent for spell cultivation," Zhang Yan replied with a modest smile.  

He saw no reason to hide his progress—after all, spells were meant to be used, and others would notice sooner or later. Besides, displaying his proficiency might even bring unexpected benefits, especially in a field as practical as spirit farming.  

"Young and accomplished… truly young and accomplished," Old Lin muttered, struggling to find words before finally settling on praise.  

"Just luck, just luck," Zhang Yan said humbly, clasping his hands in a polite gesture.  

He still worked under Old Lin, so it was best to remain modest.  

Truthfully, he would have preferred to work independently, but he didn’t yet have his own spirit field. Without it, he couldn’t sustain himself.  

Moreover, Old Lin’s harvest was imminent.  

Zhang Yan still remembered Old Lin’s promise—**a share of the profits.**  

Even if it was just a single spirit stone, he’d take it.  

Poverty made one pragmatic.  

"Unfortunately, my cultivation is still too low—only at the first layer of Qi Refining. I can’t cast spells many times yet, otherwise my progress would be even faster," Zhang Yan murmured to himself.  

Old Lin’s face stiffened. Without a word, he turned and walked away.  

**This kid was too much.**  

Seven days to Minor Achievement, and he still wasn’t satisfied?  

"Come to think of it, my daughter hasn’t visited in a while. Maybe I should call her back," Old Lin muttered under his breath, glancing at Zhang Yan’s youthful face.

After finishing his work in the fields, Zhang Yan checked the time and headed straight for the Enlightenment Peak.  

Today’s lesson was on the Wood Essence Technique.  

Since he had already learned the spell, he intended to make the most of the lecture.  

Upon entering the Enlightenment Hall, he spotted Mu Sen immediately.  

The hall was nearly full, with only a few empty seats left.  

Mu Sen gave Zhang Yan a slight nod in acknowledgment.  

Ordinary disciples might not catch his attention, but Zhang Yan was hard to forget—after all, Mu Sen had never seen a disciple so… *unique* in his pursuit of female cultivators.  

Zhang Yan found an empty seat and settled in, waiting for the lecture to begin.  

"Excuse me, may I sit here?" A clear, melodious voice sounded beside him.  

"Of course, this seat’s free," Zhang Yan replied automatically before turning his head.  

To his surprise, the speaker was none other than the young woman he had encountered last time.  

"It’s you again, you lecher!" Ji Yourong’s eyes widened in recognition, her temper flaring instantly.  

"Don’t slander me," Zhang Yan frowned.  

This woman was ridiculous.  

All he had done was buy the meditation cushion she was sitting on—how did that make him a lecher?  

He had paid for it fair and square!  

"You—!" Ji Yourong opened her mouth to retort, but at that moment, Mu Sen began his lecture.  

Swallowing her words, she could only glare at Zhang Yan in frustration.  

Causing a disturbance here would get her thrown out of the Enlightenment Peak.  

---  

"Last time, we covered the basics of the Wood Essence Technique. Today, we’ll discuss its applications."  

"The Wood Essence Technique condenses wood-attributed spiritual energy. Not only can it accelerate plant growth, but it can also be used for healing."  

Mu Sen held up a seed in his palm.  

With a surge of spiritual power, the seed sprouted, its roots and stems rapidly expanding. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a grotesque flower with a gaping maw lined with razor-sharp teeth.  

The flower thrashed violently, as if roaring silently at its surroundings.  

Gasps of shock filled the hall.  

No one had expected a mere seed to unleash such a fearsome creature in an instant.  

"This is a **Spirit Devouring Flower**. It lacks intelligence but instinctively attacks anything with spiritual energy."  

"Its combat strength isn’t high—the strongest only reach late-stage Qi Refining. However, since the Wood Essence Technique can rapidly cultivate it, it’s extremely practical."  

Mu Sen smiled at the audience.  

"To those who achieve Initial Mastery in the Wood Essence Technique first, I will reward them with ten Spirit Devouring Flower seeds."  

Zhang Yan’s eyes lit up.  

"Initial Mastery grants Spirit Devouring Flower seeds?"  

Unable to contain himself, he blurted out, "What if someone reaches Minor Achievement?"  

"Minor Achievement?"  

Mu Sen glanced at him. "In addition to the seeds, I’d reward them with other spirit plant seeds—or even a magical artifact."  

"Minor Achievement?"  

"Most of us haven’t even reached Initial Mastery yet. Who knows how long it’ll take to reach Minor Achievement?"  

Murmurs of disbelief spread through the crowd.  

Spell cultivation wasn’t like other skills—it required years of practice and innate talent.  

To most, Zhang Yan’s question seemed presumptuous, if not outright delusional.  

"Spirit plants? Magical artifacts?"  

Zhang Yan’s gaze sharpened with determination.  

He stood up and declared firmly,  

**"My Wood Essence Technique has already reached Minor Achievement!"**
