# Chapter 24: Escaping the Mortal Coil

After handling everything, Han Li returned to his dwelling, collapsing onto his bed and immediately falling into a deep sleep.

Han Li felt as if the experiences of that single day were longer than his entire fourteen years combined.

"It's good to be alive!"

A smile on his lips, Han Li couldn't help but think this before drifting off to sleep.

Han Zhen returned to his dwelling and recounted the events that transpired in Divine Hand Valley to Zhang Tie, modifying a few key details. For instance, he mentioned discovering a spell called the Corpse Refinement Art and its accompanying materials at Doctor Mo's residence.

After hearing all of it, Zhang Tie remained silent for a long time, lost in thought.

"Cultivators, huh…" A relieved smile actually appeared on Zhang Tie's honest face.

He recalled his helplessness, humiliation, and worry when Doctor Mo had examined him in the past. It turned out the problem wasn't with him after all.

Standing atop the mountain, Zhang Tie gazed in the direction of Divine Hand Valley.

"Brother Zhen, is it true that without a spiritual root, one truly cannot cultivate?"

Upon hearing this, Han Zhen was somewhat surprised, yet he remained noncommittal.

Cultivators would fight to the death over a single spiritual plant.

To prolong their lives, sworn enemies could temporarily set aside their hatred and cooperate, even going so far as to scheme against over a hundred people just to find someone with a spiritual root.

However, regardless of the world, immortality has always been a long-standing pursuit of humanity; even emperors were no exception.

Now, this was no longer a vague legend but a tangible opportunity laid before him.

Despite knowing the cruelty of the cultivation world, Zhang Tie still posed that question.

Han Zhen explained the concept of spiritual root attributes to Zhang Tie and gave him a choice.

He could return to the mundane world as a mortal, where his strength from the third level of the Elephant Armor Art would ensure he wouldn't fare poorly.

Or, he could strive for that sliver of a chance to step into the cultivation world.

Zhang Tie decisively chose the latter.

"Lanzhou, Guangui City, Mount Tainan."

Under the night sky, the sound of horse hooves gradually faded into the distance. Who knew when they would meet again?

…

…

Han Li sat in Doctor Mo's usual spot, intently reading the Evergreen Art's incantations.

Several days had passed since Doctor Mo's death.

Before Han Li's last return to Divine Hand Valley, some disciples of the Seven Mysteries Sect had also noticed his extremely frail state.

Therefore, few suspected anything when Doctor Mo suddenly passed away.

On the grounds of not wanting to be disturbed, Han Li only allowed Sect Master Wang to come and pay respects to his savior.

A few months later, the reputation of "Doctor Han" began to spread within the Seven Mysteries Sect.

The reason Han Li established this reputation was that he couldn't find a better location than Divine Hand Valley for the time being, and he needed a legitimate reason to occupy it.

Within the valley, he wouldn't be disturbed and could openly use the small green bottle to accelerate the growth of medicinal herbs to aid his cultivation.

Therefore, Han Li intentionally placed a large bell at the valley entrance, so even Han Zhen would have to ring it if he wished to see him.

Han Li also set a clear goal for himself: cultivate the Evergreen Art to the eighth level within four years and learn at least three spells.

During this period, Han Li also left Divine Hand Valley for the first time in a long while.

To avoid unnecessary trouble, he specifically chose to travel along narrow, winding paths.

After watching a sparring match between fellow disciples he hadn't seen in years, Han Li couldn't help but sigh at how much everyone had changed.

While preparing to wash himself in a small stream, Han Li encountered Senior Brother Li, who had just performed exceptionally well in the sparring match.

Having been "baptized" by Doctor Mo, Han Li naturally harbored the thought that one must always be on guard against others. He proceeded to treat Li Feiyu.

As expected, Li Feiyu repaid kindness with ingratitude.

However, Han Li was no longer someone to be slaughtered at will.

In the Seven Mysteries Sect, having an informant who listened to his commands wasn't a bad idea.

This incident made Han Li's heart even colder.

Without absolute certainty and sufficient benefits, he would absolutely never again offer help to others.

…

…

A Qi Condensation sixth-level spiritual sense allowed Han Zhen to possess a photographic memory.

Of course, Han Zhen only memorized the spell incantations recorded in the last few pages of the Evergreen Art's manual.

The wording of these incantations was composed of a certain complex grammatical vocabulary.

However, Han Zhen had the blessing of [Heaven Rewards Diligence]; no matter how difficult something was to comprehend, as long as he repeatedly pondered it, each time he would gain a new understanding.

He didn't consider the simplest Heavenly Eye Art first. Such a minor technique involving the use of spiritual power would only take an instant to master once more complex spells were learned.

Han Zhen first chose the offensive Fireball Art. This was his first encounter with a complex spell, and Han Zhen didn't know if his talent for magic was good or bad.

"If I can learn the Fireball Art within half a year, that will be a success."

This was the lower limit Han Zhen set for himself. Surely, he couldn't be worse than Han Li in terms of spell talent, right?

During his first study session, Han Zhen read through the Fireball Art's incantations and began to perceive their true meaning word by word.

During the second study session, Han Zhen could already understand the meaning of each sentence, but they still made no sense when combined.

…

And so, with each study session, he circulated his spiritual power according to the incantations.

Three days later, Han Zhen, who had been motionless for a long time, suddenly raised his left hand and extended his index finger.

Suddenly, a slight fluctuation occurred in the air, and tiny sparks appeared out of thin air at Han Zhen's fingertip.

Then, for no apparent reason, a fist-sized red fireball formed in the air, and an intensely hot temperature permeated the entire room.

If not for the fact that there was nothing else in the cultivation chamber, it would likely have spontaneously combusted.

"Am I a genius?"

Seven days later, the walls of the cultivation chamber were pitted and uneven, with some areas even scorched black.

Below the stone wall, there was also a "puddle" of molten iron that had solidified after melting.

After seven days of diligent practice, Han Zhen finally achieved minor success with the Fireball Art.

After he could flexibly control the Fireball Art, Han Zhen quickly shifted his focus. He had been looking forward to the Object Manipulation Art for a long time.

Because the Fireball Art had a clear disadvantage: it was easily dodged by those skilled in movement techniques or nimble footwork.

If the Object Manipulation Art could guide small arrows to attack enemies at extremely high speed while also being able to turn, then Han Zhen's offensive methods would become much richer.

As he practiced, Han Zhen gradually mastered the use of the Object Manipulation Art.

However, he could clearly feel that his Qi Condensation sixth-level spiritual power could not sustain the manipulation of small arrows for too long.

The arrow itself was only part of a magic tool; if he had the original matching bow, it might be much easier.

Han Zhen temporarily put the Spirit-Stabilizing Talisman and Wind Manipulation Art last, deciding it wouldn't be too late to cultivate them after breaking through to the eighth level of the Evergreen Art.

The Spirit-Stabilizing Talisman was constrained by the need for talismans, and Han Zhen himself was already a master of movement techniques, so there was no rush to use the Wind Manipulation Art.

After all, the cultivation realm was the foundation of everything; spending too much time on spell cultivation would be putting the cart before the horse.

Two years later.

This year, Han Zhen was eighteen years old, and Han Li was sixteen.

Han Zhen emerged from the cultivation chamber, having finally cultivated the Evergreen Art to the eighth level of perfection after two years.

Aside from the Spirit-Stabilizing Talisman, he had also mastered the other four spells to a state of profound proficiency.

"It has finally come to this day…"

Han Zhen stood atop the highest point of Mount Cai Xia, the peak of the Setting Sun Peak's main hall, looking out at the mountains stretching for dozens of miles around.

Six years had flown by in a flash, and it was finally time for farewells.

There were still two years remaining until the Seven Mysteries Sect and the Wild Wolf Gang engaged in full-scale war.

The Immortal Ascension Token in Revered Golden Light's possession was something Han Zhen was determined to obtain.

Even if he didn't need it himself, he could trade it with Han Li, who might need it in the future, for many things.

Even if Han Li feigned difficulty to avoid revealing his wealth, it would still put Han Li in his debt.

Without subsequent cultivation methods for the Evergreen Art, these two years certainly couldn't be wasted.

On this day, the bell outside Divine Hand Valley was rung once more.

Han Li, who had achieved success in cultivating the Heavenly Eye Art, understood the moment he saw Han Zhen had reached the eighth level of the Evergreen Art, perfect completion.

"Is he leaving?"
