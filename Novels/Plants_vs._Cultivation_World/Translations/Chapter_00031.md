# Chapter 31: Conditions  

"This is just the first investment, Boss Yao. We can provide 100 spirit stones every year from now on," Wu Jinfei said as he handed over the spirit stones, continuing to explain the group's earlier discussion.  

A single investment was clearly not enough to ensure Yao Shifeng's rise as their backer. Thus, they had agreed to invest in him annually—25 spirit stones from each of them. While this amount might be a burden initially, as they became more proficient in their tasks and their income increased, 25 spirit stones would become easily manageable.  

Wu Jinfei's words filled Yao Shifeng with delight. This was an unexpected boon. While he had already planned to seek support from them yearly, their proactive offer was even better.  

"Of course, Boss Yao, there's a condition," Wu Jinfei took a deep breath and glanced at Gu Mo. The proposal for continuous investment had come from Gu Mo, as had the condition that followed—one the others found entirely reasonable.  

"What condition?" Yao Shifeng straightened slightly.  

"The condition is that you must show us tangible progress in your cultivation," Wu Jinfei said seriously. The worst outcome of an investment was seeing no returns, so when Gu Mo proposed this condition, everyone had agreed.  

"Deal!"  

Yao Shifeng saw no issue with this demand. If he couldn't keep advancing in strength, what was the point of aiming for greatness? His confidence reignited, and he brimmed with determination.  

After agreeing to meet again a year later, Yao Shifeng hurried off, eager to convert the spirit stones into tangible power.  

"Hu Hai!"  

Gu Mo called out to Hu Hai before he could leave. Under the other's puzzled gaze, Gu Mo tossed him a small pouch.  

"What's this?"  

Opening the pouch, Hu Hai found a pound of spirit rice inside. Though he worked in the Alchemy Peak and wasn't fully aware of the situation in the Spirit Plant Hall, he knew that obtaining specialty products from one's assigned peak wasn't impossible for a labor disciple—but it wasn't easy either.  

In the Alchemy Peak, Hu Hai's task was processing medicinal herbs. The raw materials provided exceeded the required output, accounting for processing losses.  

If the losses were too high and he failed to meet the quota, the task would be deemed a failure, and he'd receive no reward. But if he mastered the technique and minimized waste, the surplus could become his extra income.  

At present, Hu Hai was barely scraping by. It would take him a few more years to reliably reduce losses and earn excess materials for trade.  

Now, Gu Mo had simply handed him a pound of spirit rice—proof, in Hu Hai's eyes, that Gu Mo had already gained a foothold in spirit farming.  

However, Hu Hai had just spent 25 spirit stones investing in Yao Shifeng and had nothing left to buy Gu Mo's rice.  

"This is what I promised you—spirit rice once I joined the Spirit Plant Hall," Gu Mo said with a smile. It was repayment for Hu Hai's earlier goodwill.  

Hu Hai paused, then recalled their discussion back in the labor disciple quarters when they were deciding their paths.  

"Then next time, I'll bring you some herbs," Hu Hai accepted the rice and made his own promise in return.  

"Gu Mo, you really are full of surprises."  

Once Hu Hai had left, Chu Feifei approached Gu Mo. She had long suspected there was more to him than met the eye—ever since experiencing his Cleaning Technique. And time and again, Gu Mo had proven her right, delivering one pleasant surprise after another.  

"I'm nothing compared to you!"  

Gu Mo glanced at Chu Feifei. She was likely the most advanced in cultivation among their group. Though Yao Shifeng had been the first to reach Qi Refining, his progress had stalled at the Talisman Peak. Meanwhile, Chu Feifei, aided by her unique constitution, had caught up.  

If they were to invest in someone, Chu Feifei would be the best choice. If her special physique were fully unlocked, her potential would rival that of inner disciples.  

"Come on, let's find a quiet spot to discuss the Cleaning Technique!" Chu Feifei shot him a look, knowing her secrets were already exposed to him. But this also meant she could openly seek his guidance—something that had become a crucial part of her training.  

"Actually, I have a favor to ask of you too," Gu Mo nodded.  

"Oh? What is it?"  

Hearing that Gu Mo needed her help, Chu Feifei perked up. He had assisted her many times, and she was eager to return the favor. Mutual aid was the foundation of strong bonds.  

"I have a damaged formation disk. Can you take a look and see if it's repairable?" As a labor disciple of the Formation Peak, Chu Feifei's knowledge of arrays far surpassed his. If the disk could be restored, Gu Mo would gain a dual-purpose treasure—capable of both illusions and defense.  

"No problem. But don't get your hopes up—my understanding of formations is still rudimentary." When she heard Gu Mo had acquired a formation disk, Chu Feifei's eyes gleamed with realization.  

This Gu Mo was full of hidden depths. While others were still struggling with basic tasks, he had somehow gotten his hands on a formation disk—even a damaged one was worth a fair sum.  

"No worries."  

Gu Mo waved it off and led Chu Feifei away from the market. Under her astonished gaze, he produced a paper crane.  

Spirit rice, a formation disk, and now a paper crane? Chu Feifei was stunned. How could a labor disciple of just one year possess such assets?  

"Get on!"  

Gu Mo beckoned to the dazed Chu Feifei. The damaged disk was set up in his spirit field, so he needed to take her there.  

The best option for repairing it would have been hiring a full-fledged formation master, or at least an experienced Formation Peak labor disciple. But Gu Mo had chosen Chu Feifei—someone who had only been at the peak for a year—for one simple reason: trust.  

He already knew her biggest secret. By revealing some of his own minor ones, he could deepen their mutual confidence.  

Trust was a rare and precious thing in the world of cultivation.  

Besides, Chu Feifei's help came cheap. Even if she couldn't fix the disk now, Gu Mo could wait. He could even prepay her—effectively supporting her in advance. Who knew? In time, he might gain a reliable formation master as an ally.
