# Chapter 254: The Way of Sorcery - Sword Control, A Marriage Contract

The dream was misty, neither entirely real nor completely illusory.

Since ancient times, there have been countless tales of legacies passed down in dreams. Most people believe that the more powerful the legacy, the deeper it must be hidden. However, Lu Dongzhi acted contrary to this conventional wisdom. Although his tomb contained precious treasures, it was difficult to find martial arts manuals or recipes for the Way of Sorcery.

The stele containing the legacy dream was actually set up outside the cave. If one had the fate, why would they need to enter the tomb to seek it? A single glance might resonate with the legacy, and the dream would be bestowed upon them.

"The Way of Sorcery... do you know what the Way of Sorcery is?" Lu Dongzhi asked.

Li Xian immediately gave a concise answer, describing his own understanding. Lu Dongzhi was extremely surprised, asking if Li Xian had an exceptionally brilliant master. For martial artists rarely speak of their knowledge of the Way of the Martial Path. Many martial artists enter the realm of the Way of the Martial Path in a daze, their knowledge lacking any systematic structure.

Seeing that Li Xian had a fairly deep understanding of the Way of the Martial Path, and knowing that the legacy dream wouldn't last through the night, Lu Dongzhi got straight to the point. "Since you already know of the Way of Sorcery, I won't say much more. I consumed the essence of heaven and the精华 of earth, mastering three paths of sorcery."

"Dream Legacy, Riding the Wind, and Caressing the Crane."

Li Xian listened quietly.

Lu Dongzhi said, "You already understand the Dream Legacy sorcery. It was purely a stroke of luck for you, brat, and has no other use. The Way of Sorcery - Riding the Wind allows one to fly and hover in the air."

"This sorcery, when paired with lightness skill, allows one to ride the wind and remain suspended in the air for a long time. How unrestrained and elegant! Can natural barriers and treacherous terrain stop me even a little? Is there any place I cannot go?"

"As for the Way of Sorcery - Caressing the Crane. It was something I comprehended in the early stages of my martial arts practice, when my realm was still shallow, after recklessly consuming various things. But when paired with 'Riding the Wind', one can 'Ride the Wind and Caress the Crane', which is quite excellent."

Li Xian couldn't help but feel a sense of yearning, and asked further, "It's so powerful, why do you feel regret?"

Lu Dongzhi said, "I once invited seven other martial artists to an island in a certain sea region. That sea was filled with towering waves, full of danger. Ships could not cross it, only flight was possible."

"My seven friends and I each sought methods to cross the sea. The Way of the Martial Path, the Way of Sorcery, rare treasures and artifacts... we tried everything we could."

"But in the end, we failed!"

Li Xian said, "Senior, you travel by crane, covering a thousand miles in a day. Surely you could cross the sea?"

Lu Dongzhi said, "With 'Riding the Wind' and 'Caressing the Crane', if I may be so bold, I can go anywhere under heaven. Even the boudoir of the Empress of the Nanyang Dynasty, hehe... I could sneak in every night, and no one would know."

"But sorceries like 'Riding the Wind' and 'Caressing the Crane' consume a great deal of mental energy when activated. And the sea is vast and boundless. Halfway through the journey, amidst the wind and waves... my spirit would be exhausted, forcing me to abandon the attempt halfway!"

"If only I had mastered the 'Way of Sorcery - Sword Control', paired with my Pure Yang Divine Sword, it would have been possible to cross the vast ocean!"

He let out a heavy sigh at this point.

Lu Dongzhi said, "So, my greatest regret is that I never truly 'Controlled the Sword'."

Upon hearing the words 'Sword Control', Li Xian's mind immediately conjured the image of a divine figure standing atop a flying sword, slaying enemies a thousand miles away.

Lu Dongzhi said, "This 'Dream Legacy' sorcery was originally meant to be 'Sword Control', but something went wrong along the way, leaving me with a lifelong regret. Therefore, my greatest regret, and my greatest legacy, is the 'Sword Control Recipe'."

Li Xian asked suspiciously, "Senior Lu, what if I also end up with a 'Dream Legacy' after consuming it?"

Lu Dongzhi was merely a wisp of a dream legacy. Hearing Li Xian's disdain for the "Dream Legacy" sorcery, he felt a pang in his heart, his face twitching. The path of sorcery is infinitely profound. Even the slightest deviation in consumption can lead to a completely different sorcery.

What one's heart yearns for is often unattainable.

Lu Dongzhi said, "I have already modified the recipe. If you strictly follow the recipe for consumption, it may not be 'Sword Control', but it definitely won't be 'Dream Legacy'. Alas, 'Dream Legacy' isn't bad either; some clan forces are quite fond of it."

He cupped his hands towards the white mist. A scroll of recipes appeared.

The recipe read:

Way of Sorcery - Sword Control.

Essentials of Precious Treasures: Earth Essence 36 - Earth魁, Heavenly Essence 31 - Heavenly魁, Human Yellow 15 - Sword Tomb Yellow.

Below it detailed the taboos for consumption, the sequence of consumption... and so on, very thoroughly.

Lu Dongzhi's consumption order was: Sword Tomb Yellow, Earth魁, Heavenly魁, resulting in the "Way of Sorcery - Dream Legacy". But to achieve the "Way of Sorcery - Sword Control", one must first consume Heavenly魁, then Earth魁, and finally taste Sword Tomb Yellow.

However, "Heavenly Essence" is difficult to find, and "Earth Essence" is hard to come by. Even if Lu Dongzhi were to try a thousand more times, he would still follow the order of Sword Tomb Yellow, Earth魁, Heavenly魁.

Li Xian said, "Senior Lu, Heavenly Essence and Earth Essence are incredibly difficult to find. I'm afraid I won't be able to obtain them. It's helpless to have the recipe but none of the ingredients."

Lu Dongzhi said, "You are right. To find a trace of Earth Essence in a few hundred years is extremely fortunate. Heavenly Essence is even rarer, rarely appearing in the world."

"This is indeed a great challenge, but you, brat, have good fortune!"

"I have Heavenly Essence, and I also have Earth Essence. But... I have stored them elsewhere. Since you are the inheritor of my dream legacy, these things are all for you. You can go and retrieve them when the time comes!"

Li Xian asked, "Where are they stored?"

Lu Dongzhi said, "The Heavenly魁 is in the Nebula Palace, the Earth魁 is on Mount Huangfu, and the Sword Tomb Yellow is not difficult to find. Many sword-secting clans have traces of it."

Li Xian muttered to himself, "If these treasures were mine, I wouldn't have the heart to store them elsewhere."

Lu Dongzhi seemed to sense this, coughed lightly twice, and said, "At the time, I was pursuing the Palace Master of the Nebula Palace, so I tried to curry favor by storing the Heavenly魁 there."

Li Xian saw that Lu Dongzhi was unpretentious and easy-going. He relaxed as well and asked with a smile, "Did you succeed?"

Lu Dongzhi shook his head and sighed, "I, Lu Dongzhi, am unparalleled in my elegance, but I can't always get what I want. It's a pity and a lament. Heaven is jealous, and people resent it. The Palace Master of the Nebula Palace just wasn't interested in me."

Li Xian thought to himself that the "Way of Sorcery - Sword Control" was still far from being within reach. But obtaining the map was already a pleasant surprise, and he dared not ask for more.

Lu Dongzhi said, "As for my second greatest regret. In my entire life, I had many disciples, but none received my true transmission. Since you have answered my dream legacy, regardless of your talent, there is something about you that I quite appreciate."

"You must attempt to cross the sea on my behalf."

Li Xian said frankly, "Even without your legacy, your map has already saved my life. If I have the chance in the future, I will surely do my best to serve you. However, I cannot guarantee that I will be able to cross the sea."

Lu Dongzhi said with satisfaction:

"I like your attitude!"

He spoke of the past:

"Back then, the eight of us约定 to cross the sea, all to express our spirit and display our heroism. In the end, we failed, which was a great regret, but it was to be expected. If you say we were heartbroken or disappointed, that wasn't quite the case. After all, that sea is incredibly dangerous, with thunderous roars, how could it be easily crossed?"

"After the failure of crossing the sea, we were all injured. We gathered at the Eight Immortals Tower to drink, and I drank to my heart's content. Suddenly, I said, 'My friends, in this lifetime, it is unlikely we will see that island. But perhaps in later generations, there will be a genius who can fulfill our unfinished regret. I hear that Lords Li and Han have both accepted formidable disciples. How about this... let us make a pact to cross the sea. Let it be passed down from generation to generation?' The other seven all agreed."

"Over the years, the pact to cross the sea may have been forgotten. But I have kept my promise and told you this matter. It is up to you to decide!"

He immediately spoke of the location of the sea and various details. Finally, he passed down the [Five Organs Expelling Turbid Qi and Meeting Yang Meridian].

Then he spoke of his third greatest regret: "Alas, actually, the third regret concerns a romantic partner. I stored the Earth魁 on Mount Huangfu, in fact, to pursue a beauty. In the end, I didn't win the beauty's heart, but I ended up with a marriage contract."

Li Xian cupped his hands and said, "Senior Lu... truly... truly broad-minded!" He thought to himself, "A Heavenly Essence and an Earth Essence... all used for courtship."

Lu Dongzhi sneered, "Heh, since you answered my dream legacy, you must be at least a bit of a lecher. We're two of a kind, don't laugh at me."

Li Xian said, "Senior, I am very honest."

"I don't think so." Lu Dongzhi's voice grew faint, turning into white smoke and dissipating.

Li Xian snapped back to reality. The feeling of floating vanished, and he stood firmly on the ground, back in the secret study of the tomb. The candlelight flickered, casting shifting shadows. Li Xian's fatigue was gone, his mind clear. Recalling the events that had just occurred, he couldn't tell if they were real or a dream.

He savored the memory carefully. The [Five Organs Expelling Turbid Qi and Meeting Yang Meridian] was imprinted in his mind, every word and sentence incredibly clear. Li Xian rejoiced, "It seems the dream just now was indeed real. The mystery of the Way of Sorcery can actually leave a legacy for a thousand years."

The Sword Control recipe was also real!

Suddenly, a yellow paper drifted down from a bookshelf. Li Xian raised his hand and sucked it into his grasp.

It was the "Marriage Contract" Lu Dongzhi had mentioned. The content was concise, with just a few words explaining the reason for the betrothal.

It turned out... the events of that year were quite complicated. Lu Dongzhi was indeed a womanizer by nature, but the Zhao family woman on Mount Huangfu was also a peerless beauty.

At the time, the Zhao woman was comprehending the Way of Sorcery and lacked "Earth Essence - Earth魁". Lu Dongzhi happened to have some, so she spoke up to ask for it.

Lu Dongzhi naturally agreed. He gave half an inch of Earth Essence for the Zhao woman to comprehend her sorcery. The woman said, "I am very grateful that you lent me the Earth Essence, but I cannot marry you in this lifetime. State your conditions."

Lu Dongzhi did not force her and said, "Alright, be with me for three years. If you still don't like me, then so be it."

The Zhao woman knew she would never fall for Lu Dongzhi. She was grateful for his help and couldn't bear to betray his sincerity, but she was even less willing to wrong herself. So she thought of a compromise and said, "You are so persistent, very well. I will be with you for three years, but I will not fall in love. In the end, I will still owe you. How about this: even if you and I are not fated. Our descendants can repay this bond for us?"

Lu Dongzhi readily agreed and did not take back the Earth魁.

And so... this marriage contract came into being. However, before the three years were up, he had urgent business and left in a hurry. The remaining Earth魁 was stored on Mount Huangfu. Later, after three years had passed, the two truly had no fate, and thus the origin of the marriage contract was established.

Li Xian muttered, "Senior Lu has had more than ten romantic partners, but his nature is hard to change. First, he courted the Palace Master of the Nebula Palace, then he flirted with the Zhao family woman on Mount Huangfu... Tsk! This marriage contract is probably useless. This matter happened thousands of years ago, who would still remember? Besides, who knows if Mount Huangfu and the Nebula Palace even still exist."

"From the looks of it, the most useful legacy is indeed the [Five Organs Expelling Turbid Qi and Meeting Yang Meridian]. This scripture seems very profound; I'll study it slowly when I have time. For now, I must leave this forest quickly!"

He tidied up the study. He bowed respectfully in all four directions, then turned back the way he came, moving swiftly.

Lu Dongzhi's tomb was enormous, encompassing a vast area. The part Li Xian had explored was less than one ten-thousandth of it. But he had achieved his goal and gained unexpected rewards. He couldn't take all the benefits of the tomb. He turned back, full of enthusiasm.

Suddenly, he heard the sound of "da" "da" coming from a turn ahead. It was quite far away, but because the tomb was secluded and Li Xian's hearing was exceptionally sharp, he could hear it clearly.

Li Xian frowned. Having been with Wen Caishang for a long time, he knew she was elegant and dignified. Her steps were light and soundless, leaving only a scent of fragrance to tease the nose. These footsteps were definitely not hers.

"The footsteps of the person approaching are one light and one heavy, their breath is unsteady, as if they have been frightened. It is definitely not the Madam. Could there be someone else who has sneaked into the tomb? I'll hide and observe quietly!"

He pondered this in his heart.

He was very familiar with the tomb's mechanisms. He hid himself in the shadows, extinguished his torch, and listened intently. The sound of footsteps grew closer.

Li Xian observed secretly, getting a clear look at the two figures. One was from the "Wuji Blade Gate", and the other was from the "Rain of Swords Tower".
