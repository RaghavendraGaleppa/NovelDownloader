# Chapter 496: Dharma Name Wukong

She lightly tapped her fingertips, and a fleeting image appeared: the twelve towering sword peaks of the Wansheng Sword Sect suppressing the origin of the void. "The Third Sword Realm is the absolute peak he can reach in this world."

"No matter how strong his body is, he is merely the number one mid-stage Golden Core cultivator within the Taihua Lingxu Realm. As for the late stage? He can forget it."

It was a joke. The late Golden Core stage—she, Miao Di, had undergone hundreds of reincarnations and only just managed to touch the mid-stage Golden Core realm after spending tens of thousands of years.

Lü Chunyang had reached the mid-stage Golden Core and merged with a cave heaven, maintaining an eternal state in just a short thousand years. This was already the limit of tolerance for the other Golden Core True Lords of the Wansheng Sword Sect.

To take another step forward, some of those Sword Sect True Lords would have to leave, vacating their positions for Lü Chunyang to take.

Upon hearing this, the shock in Sanzang's eyes gradually faded, replaced by compassion once more. He clasped his hands together and chanted the Buddha's name softly. "Amitabha. Even if it is only the mid-stage, such sword dao attainments are rare throughout history."

After saying this, he no longer paid much attention. Since Lü Chunyang was confined to the mid-stage Golden Core, as long as he was careful in the future, there was no need to worry too much.

Moreover, Lü Chunyang's actions had already signaled his intentions to the Bodhisattva's Pure Land, and he did not want to offend him too much.

As for that Xu Yunfan...

Sanzang's mind raced. If there was an opportunity in the future, he would certainly not show mercy. Converting him into a member of the Eight Legions would not be bad either.

He turned his gaze eastward. Atop the mountain peak, the Chaos Stone Embryo swallowing the essence of the sun and moon became even clearer amidst the Buddhist light.

"Since he has already entered the game, it is fate determined by the Buddha. That Dao Embryo bears the vast karma of our Buddhist sect and absorbs the foundation of the True Martial Dao Rhyme. It is truly the missing 'Release' in the ritual!"

"We must form a connection in the Eastern Wasteland."

Miao Di Bodhisattva nodded, her voice like a clear spring cleansing the spiritual platform.

Beneath her feet, the lotus platform spun slightly. The boundless incense and wish power transformed into a golden bridge that pierced through the void in an instant, reaching the top of the nameless barren mountain in the Eastern Wasteland.

Sanzang understood. His moon-white monk robes fluttered as he stepped out. The distance of billions of miles between the Sumeru Buddhist Realm and the Eastern Wasteland妖土 shrank to a single step on the golden bridge.

Atop the nameless mountain peak, the fierce astral wind howled.

Sanzang's figure silently manifested beside the玄黄 (Xuanhuang) giant stone.

He extended his right hand, as smooth as jade, and gently pressed it against the rough, cold surface of the giant stone.

The moment his palm touched it, the two intertwined Buddhist and Martial Dao rhymes inside the stone embryo suddenly flared brightly. The entire mountain trembled slightly as if resonating.

"Om, Mani, Padme, Hum..."

The majestic and grand Six-Word Mantra flowed from Sanzang's lips. Each syllable transformed into a tangible dark golden seal, layer upon layer branding onto the surface of the giant stone.

The dark golden "Swastika" Buddhist rune deep within the stone embryo, like a long drought meeting rain, greedily devoured the pure Buddhist power. It shone brilliantly, instantly suppressing the restless Black Water Xuanwu Dao Rhyme and even dyeing the flowing Xuanhuang Primordial Qi with a layer of faint golden light.

"Take the stone as your body, bear my karma; absorb the Buddhist Dao Rhyme, shape your true spirit."

Sanzang lightly tapped the top of the stone with his fingertip, and a pure Buddhist seed merged into it. "From this day forth, you shall be my first true disciple, named 'Wukong'."

With the true words settled, the chaotic Dao patterns flowing through the giant stone gradually faded, replaced by a layer of gentle and restrained dark golden treasure light.

Although it was still nurturing a stone embryo, its core had already awakened a ray of ignorant yet vast Buddhist spiritual light.

The first Buddha Son of the Bodhi Pure Land was finally born at the peak of the Eastern Wasteland妖土, responding to the calamity!

Sanzang withdrew his hand. His gaze swept over the vast, endless, and demon-qi filled Eastern Wasteland beneath his feet. The depths of his profound eyes reflected the billions of mountains and rivers.

He turned and bowed to Miao Di Bodhisattva. Miao Di Bodhisattva nodded, withdrew the wish-power golden bridge, and spoke.

"The Buddhist affinity has gathered, and the ritual should begin. The position of the Self-Ruling King Buddha requires four people. Besides Wukong, two more disciples are needed."

"Sanzang understands."

Sanzang replied, then took a step down from the peak.

Where his foot landed, the demon soil beneath his feet actually bloomed with a golden lotus platform formed purely by Buddhist light. In a single step, he crossed ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers.

As the lotus platforms formed and vanished, majestic ancient cities, wild jungles, and great marshes...

All flowed beneath his feet like a painting.

His steps seemed slow but were actually swift. With every step, a lotus bloomed, measuring the billions of miles of mountains and rivers of the Eastern Wasteland with his feet.

The vast Buddhist light, like a tidal wave, spread out from beneath his feet, soaking every inch of land and every strand of atmosphere it passed.

The ancient, savage, and fierce aura permeating the Eastern Wasteland silently melted and transformed under this irresistible King Buddha's majesty, like snow melting against boiling water.

A supreme ritual aimed at using the entire Eastern Wasteland as the arena to open up a Buddhist land and welcome the descent of the "Great Compassionate Radiant Lotus Victory Self-Ruling King Buddha" position.

At the moment of his first step, it had already silently begun on the Eastern Wasteland!

And with every step Sanzang took, his cultivation rapidly dissipated.

After three steps, the Buddhist light completely scattered.

After ten steps, the golden lotus withered.

When Sanzang had taken three thousand six hundred steps, the brilliant Buddhist light flowing around him was like a candle in the wind.

The shadow of the Sarira suspended above his head faded bit by bit. The vast Buddhist power in his body, like a flood opening a gate, poured entirely into the Eastern Wasteland beneath his feet.

Where the demon qi dissipated, the scorched black rocks gradually took on a sandalwood golden color, and withered trees sprouted new buds as if meeting spring.

In the end, Sanzang had become an ordinary man, a mortal flesh and blood body. He landed at the edge of the Eastern Wasteland, walking step by step toward the nameless mountain peak where the stone embryo was nurturing.

Only after the last trace of light completely vanished from the horizon did Lü Chunyang slowly turn around, looking at Xu Yunfan, whose face was slightly pale due to the separation of his primordial spirit source and the stripping of his fundamental law.

He spoke in a gentle tone. "Although the *True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture* has been extracted and transferred, your foundation of mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation has not been shaken, only your realm is slightly unstable."

"Given your foundation and talent, as long as you find a suitable new method, change your path, and practice diligently, within three years at most, you will surely return to your peak, and perhaps even make further progress."

Xu Yunfan suppressed the excitement in his heart regarding the attribute panel and bowed deeply again without hesitation, his voice filled with sincerity and expectation. "This disciple's foundation is damaged, and the road ahead is dim. I ask the Ancestor to guide me!"

Lü Chunyang nodded slightly and calculated briefly.

He raised his right hand. In his palm, three tiny sword shadows, yet containing a power that made Xu Yunfan's heart tremble, flowed agilely like swimming fish, chasing each other.

Without any visible movement from him, these three sword seals turned into微光 (faint light) and merged into the depths of Xu Yunfan's brow, the Purple Mansion.

'You have obtained three Golden Core Sword Intents.'

The panel prompt appeared, making Xu Yunfan overjoyed.

Lü Chunyang's voice sounded directly in Xu Yunfan's ear.

"These are three protective sword intents refined from my Golden Core cultivation. Sword One: Breaking Illusion, breaks all illusions and obstructions. Sword Two: Calamity Annihilation, annihilates all disasters. Sword Three: No Return, goes forth without returning to destroy."

"When facing life-and-death tribulations, heart demon invasions, or being traced by powerful external forces from afar, these sword intents will naturally manifest to protect their master, preserving a sliver of life."

After imparting the life-preserving sword seals, Lü Chunyang raised two fingers like a spear. A point of brilliant starlight condensed at his fingertip, and he lightly tapped the void before him.

Instantly, golden, flowing-fire-like points of light poured out from his fingertip. Amidst the dense starlight, they quickly spread and outlined a golden seal text diagram, mysterious and unpredictable, encompassing the movement trajectories of the周天 (heavenly) stars.
