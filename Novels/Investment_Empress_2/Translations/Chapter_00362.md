# Chapter 362: Entering the Ice Cube’s Room at Night, What to Do If Discovered?

In the South, within the Temple of the Deep Forest Valley.

“Holy Son, these are the things I saw and heard today.”

Luo Yexian sat boldly in the seat once occupied by Han Zhen, reporting to the Holy Son. His expression could only be described as ‘I did it on purpose, but pretended it was an accident.’

After all, he had delivered ‘tribute’ to the High Immortal. He felt that a meteoric rise was just within reach.

The Holy Son’s figure swayed slightly. He looked at his overly pleased uncle-in-law, a hint of coldness in his eyes, but he didn't explode. Instead, he fell into deep thought.

Mountains of gold...

Spiritual treasures scattered everywhere...

The Primordial Golden Crow...

Nine Dragons Dragging a Palace!

If any one of these were true, it would be enough to shock the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths!

However, the Demon-Calling Holy Son was not easily deceived. His eerie voice rang out again:

“The Great Thousand World is full of wonders. How can you be sure this wasn't an illusion?”

“For instance, the Holy Maiden of the Drizzle Pavilion, Yin Mianmian. Her Devil Body, at the Outer Scene realm, can shift between reality and illusion. Who is to say there aren't similar treasures or methods?”

Luo Yexian revealed a confident smile:

“Holy Son, nephew, you know your uncle. Do I look like the type to believe others easily?”

“When I was browsing the miscellaneous goods room of the Vast Expanse Immortal Sect, I already verified it.”

The Master of the Hundred Beasts Hall wasn't exactly clean-handed.

He pulled a few items from his怀里 (bosom).

A palm-sized lump of gold, a night pearl the size of a baby’s fist, and a jade bottle containing a full bottle of Six-Patterned Pills.

“I took these randomly. If it were an illusion, they would have revealed themselves by now.”

The Demon-Calling Holy Son remained silent for a long time, unable to suppress his surging emotions.

If this were truly the case.

Wasn't his return to the number one spot on the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List) just around the corner?

He remained silent for a long time before slowly speaking:

“I will bring two Dharma Kings from the sect to investigate.”

“Also, next time you report official business, use your title!”

***

Pay attention, this man is called Xiao Li.

He was lying on his familiar bed, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. He could only stare at the ceiling counting silver notes, hoping it would help him fall asleep.

Unfortunately, he neither fell asleep nor finished counting the notes.

“I haven't practiced today, and I haven't finished reviewing the battle against the Golden Crow projection.”

“It must be the guilt of not working hard enough that's keeping me from sleeping.”

Li Mo couldn't help but sigh at how much he wanted to work hard.

Even if he became number one on the Hidden Dragon List one day, he could righteously say in his acceptance speech that it was all due to sweat and effort.

I wonder if the Ice Cube has rested yet...

Li Mo sat up straight and looked out the window. The room not far away was pitch black, the lights already out, only a faint glow visible.

“Did I misread the signal?”

At dinner today, when the Ice Cube left the table, she definitely gave him a look. She was clearly waiting for him.

Thinking of this, Li Mo left the room in the dark, stepping lightly onto the corridor.

The Li residence was not small. At night, it was deserted and silent.

But after just a few steps, footsteps sounded from ahead.

Li Mo was startled.

The other person was also startled:

“You brat, are you crazy? You walk without a sound! You scared the hell out of me.”

“Dad, why are you wandering around in the middle of the night?”

“What am I doing? I’m coming back from the latrine. What else would I be doing? Looking for food?”

“Heh, what a coincidence. I was also going to the latrine to... *cough*... relieve myself.”

Li Mo laughed it off and headed towards the latrine.

“This brat.”

Li Dalong tightened his belt. He suspected his son was being two-faced, but he had no evidence.

Watching his son hurry away, he could only mutter suspiciously and turn back to his room.

***

Behind the latrine, hearing his father’s footsteps fade away, Li Mo finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Even the mighty Li Jianxian, fourth on the Hidden Dragon List, would inevitably let his guard down when he got home. But that was just a small slip-up, not a big deal.

Confirming there was no movement from his parents' room, Li Mo finally went to Ying Bing’s room.

Young Master Li carried himself with a heavy sense of stealth, like a thief.

Even though it was his own home, it wasn't clear what he was stealing...

*Squeak—*

The room wasn't locked!

Moonlight poured into the wing room. It was as plain and cold as the Ice Cube herself. Aside from the table, chairs, bed, and necessary tea set, there were no other items.

It wasn't that the Li family was stingy or cold.

In fact, because Ying Bing was the daughter of an old friend, his parents treated her very well, even better than they treated their own biological son, Li Mo.

It's just that Ying Bing previously didn't like extra things.

Ying Bing was sitting on the bed. The calm, eternal light of the Jade Phoenix God illuminated her face, making it look like a bright moon in a dream. Hearing the movement at the door, her eyelashes trembled slightly, but she didn't move.

As if she hadn't heard.

Li Mo moved closer, gazing at the Cold Fairy’s face.

Lately, he felt that the ethereal aura the Ice Cube naturally possessed was becoming even more distinct.

It shouldn't be an illusion...

They say a girl changes eighteen times before adulthood, but how could the Ice Cube change...

“I'm here, Ice Cube.”

Ying Bing gently pursed her lips, took a cushion out of the big-headed doll, placed it beside her, and patted it gently.

“Come here.”

“You waited a long time.”

“Mm, waiting for a gentleman to sneak into a woman's boudoir in the middle of the night.”

Li Mo felt inexplicably guilty under her deep gaze.

Come to think of it.

When he was home before, he had entered the Ice Cube's room very few times, let alone sat on her bed.

“Ice Cube, let's practice quickly.”

Li Mo grabbed her fair hand, employing the topic diversion technique.

Ying Bing put away the Jade Phoenix God and nodded slightly. The moonlight outside the window suddenly brightened.

Both of them had Double Divine Forms.

But the Lunar Divine Form, as the first Divine Intent they observed, remained the foundation of their realm.

Li Mo had obtained a Divine Intent that could slightly slow time and temporarily clear negative emotions, with more mysteries waiting to be discovered.

The Lunar Divine Form could complement any other Divine Form.

Moreover, it could complement the Ice Cube's Lunar Divine Intent...

The moon gradually drifted away from the center of the sky.

The two tacitly stopped. The Ice Cube teacher gave a light tutorial, summarizing most of the Golden Crow projection's fighting style.

“Little Golden Crow, I’m definitely taking you down today!”

Li Mo said as he lay down, scratching his neck hard.

Did he get bitten by a mosquito while hiding behind the latrine?

What kind of mosquito is this vicious? It's already winter!

The Little World trembled.

Li Mo closed his eyes and peacefully entered the dreamland.

“......”

Ying Bing opened her mouth slightly, then gently bit her lip.

She wanted to say, what if Uncle and Auntie suddenly come in? What would we say if they saw it in the morning? We can't just say he was sleepwalking...

But seeing that Li Mo had fallen asleep in three seconds, with a slightly red patch on his neck.

Like a peach blossom.

The tranquility in Ying Bing's eyes trembled slightly.

PS: Some readers mentioned that it feels a bit flat recently. It's mainly because we just finished a small climax, so there is a difference in plot rhythm and emotion. But climaxes are built up bit by bit.

This book isn't even half over yet, and there are still many things to be written. Please have a little confidence in this little author.
