# Chapter 37: Smooth Retrieval and a Skeleton

Seeing Qi Chuan agree, a trace of joy immediately appeared on Qi Chan'er's fair little face.  

"Shall we set off now?" she asked with slight excitement.  

Qi Chuan nodded. Since he had agreed, he wouldn't waste any time.  

Thus, the two of them cast Levitation and left the small rocky island, heading out of the black swamp. Soon, they emerged from the swamp.  

Beyond the black swamp lay a dense, towering forest.  

The two traversed the forest, venturing deeper into the Cloudrise Mountains.  

Along the way, they moved cautiously, concealing their tracks to avoid encounters with demonic beasts. Occasionally, when they couldn't avoid it and came across one or two low-tier demonic beasts, they struck swiftly and decisively, eliminating them with minimal disturbance.  

Thanks to their careful approach, the journey proceeded without any mishaps.  

After some time, they finally arrived outside a hidden valley.  

The area was strewn with rubble. Qi Chuan, his body nearly transparent from his Concealment spell, hid behind a large boulder with a dense forest at his back.  

Peering through the scattered rocks ahead, he could see the narrow entrance to the valley. Thick branches extended around the entrance, nearly blocking it entirely and making it difficult to spot.  

Through a small gap, however, he could faintly glimpse a jade-like glow emanating from within—likely the Spirit Ginseng Fruit they sought.  

"There used to be a few Crimson Jade Serpent Grass on this rocky ground, but I harvested them a month ago. If not for them, I wouldn't have discovered this hidden valley. I ventured inside cautiously but retreated immediately when I spotted the Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees from a distance."  

Beside him, Qi Chan'er was also under the effects of Concealment, her body appearing translucent. A trace of lingering fear flickered in her expression.  

Back then, she had been completely unprepared and lacked the Corpse Centipede Blood. If she had run headlong into the swarm of Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees, the outcome would have been dire—her bones likely wouldn't have remained intact.  

She then pointed to a spot nearby.  

Following her gesture, Qi Chuan indeed saw signs of recent harvesting among the rocks, along with a few tiny sprouts of Crimson Jade Serpent Grass.  

"Let's scout the situation first," Qi Chuan said.  

The two cautiously approached the valley entrance and peered inside. True enough, within the small valley, atop a mound, grew a towering emerald-green tree. Its branches and leaves shimmered with a jade-like radiance, and among the uppermost branches, several spirit-rich, white-jade fruits could faintly be seen, each covered in fine, ginseng-like tendrils.  

This was undoubtedly the Spirit Ginseng Fruit.  

Qi Chuan's gaze shifted slightly downward, and his pupils contracted sharply. Beneath the tree, suspended from a thick branch, was a massive hive the size of a giant vat. Clinging to it were hundreds of palm-sized demonic bees, their bodies a mix of pitch-black and dark crimson.  

*Buzz...*  

The bees' compound eyes gleamed with a sinister red light as their wings vibrated faintly, filling the air with a faint, unsettling hum.  

"Indeed, several hundred low-tier demonic beasts," Qi Chuan murmured with a nod.  

He could sense that these Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees weren't particularly strong—even among low-tier demonic beasts, they were relatively weak. Even the queen bee, roughly the size of a human head, seemed to remain within the low-tier range, though slightly stronger than the worker bees.  

Qi Chuan then swept his gaze across the rest of the valley. From this angle, the layout was clear—there were no other demonic beasts inside, though a few spots shimmered with spiritual light, indicating the presence of valuable spirit herbs.  

If the opportunity arose, they could gather some of those as well.  

"Well?" Qi Chan'er looked at him expectantly.  

Qi Chuan didn't hesitate. "Let's proceed."  

With that, he moved swiftly, positioning himself about twenty paces from the valley entrance. He then activated Concealment to its fullest extent, rendering himself not only completely invisible but also suppressing his aura to near imperceptibility.  

Qi Chan'er blinked in surprise. Even she could barely sense his presence now. If she hadn't witnessed him hiding there herself, she would have assumed the spot was empty.  

"His Concealment is this advanced too?"  

She smacked her forehead in realization. "Right, I almost forgot—he's a prodigy in spellcraft. In just four years, he mastered the Fireball Technique to the Great Completion stage. Even if he only devoted a little effort to Concealment, his progress would still be remarkable."  

She then retrieved the vial of Corpse Centipede Blood, preparing to lure the bees.  

Nearby, Qi Chuan watched her movements calmly.  

His Concealment was still only at the Entry stage, not yet Minor Completion, but it was far more refined than the average practitioner's. Over the past few months, whenever he had spare time, he had devoted extra effort to this spell, recognizing its utility in most situations.  

With a bit more practice, reaching Minor Completion wouldn't be an issue.  

This gave him added confidence in their mission. Given the Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees' limited intelligence, they were unlikely to detect him while he was concealed.  

Under Qi Chuan's watchful gaze, Qi Chan'er smeared the Corpse Centipede Blood onto her Golden Light Ring.  

Though the blood had corrosive properties, it posed no threat to a high-grade magical artifact.  

Once the application was complete, she retreated while maintaining Concealment, putting distance between herself and the ring.  

At the Qi Refining stage, the range for controlling magical artifacts was limited but not excessively so. By keeping her distance and relying on the Corpse Centipede Blood's allure, the chances of the bees detecting her were slim.  

She then guided the Golden Light Ring into the valley.  

With a series of hand seals, the ring emitted a faint golden glow, accelerating the spread of the Corpse Centipede Blood's scent. Soon, the entire valley was saturated with its foul, bloody odor.  

*Buzz...*  

The moment the stench permeated the air, the hive beneath the Spirit Ginseng Tree erupted in agitation.  

Like a dark cloud, hundreds of Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees took flight, their compound eyes blazing with crimson light as they surged toward the Golden Light Ring.  

Qi Chan'er promptly withdrew the ring, leading the swarm out of the valley.  

The bees pursued relentlessly, their focus locked onto the scent, oblivious to the concealed figures of Qi Chuan and Qi Chan'er.  

Seeing the swarm successfully lured away, Qi Chan'er maintained her Concealment, carefully guiding them farther off to buy Qi Chuan time to harvest the Spirit Ginseng Fruit.  

Once the swarm, the ring, and Qi Chan'er had vanished into the distance, Qi Chuan finally moved.  

He stepped into the valley, scanning the hive beneath the tree. As expected, only a handful of bees remained. After confirming the valley was otherwise clear, he swiftly approached the Spirit Ginseng Tree.  

*Buzz...*  

The few remaining bees sensed an intruder and took flight, their venomous stingers glinting menacingly.  

*Swish—*  

A gray shadow flashed, and the bees were bisected mid-air, their bodies plummeting to the ground. Against a high-grade magical artifact, these low-tier demonic beasts stood no chance.  

"Even the queen bee left. The Corpse Centipede Blood's allure is truly potent," Qi Chuan mused.  

He had prepared to face dozens of remaining bees, but only a scant few remained, making his task far easier.  

Shaking his head, he leaped onto the tree's crown, where several white-jade fruits nestled among the branches, their ginseng-like tendrils curling delicately.  

Nodding in satisfaction, Qi Chuan retrieved several jade boxes, carefully plucking each of the six Spirit Ginseng Fruits and storing them inside.  

As he prepared to leave, however, his gaze caught on something unusual—a sizable hollow in the tree, partially concealed by emerald foliage.  

Within the hollow, a shadowy figure seemed to be seated.  

"Someone's here?"  

A chill ran down his spine, but he quickly dismissed the thought. This was the Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees' lair—even a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator wouldn't dare face hundreds of them head-on.  

Hesitating briefly, Qi Chuan cautiously approached the hollow, ready to flee at any moment. But when he drew close enough to see the figure clearly, his eyes widened in shock, and he froze in place.  

"This is..."  

Inside the hollow sat a person.  

But not a living one.  

To be precise—it was a skeleton.
