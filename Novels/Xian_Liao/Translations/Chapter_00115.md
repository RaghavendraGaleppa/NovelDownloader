# Chapter 115: Snake Control

After some time had passed, Zhang Jingxiu had thoroughly explored the three-hundred-li radius of the waters. There were two particularly dangerous areas he had avoided approaching.

Meanwhile, as the underwater palace's medicinal garden cultivation progressed smoothly, Zhou Qing took advantage of Zhang Jingxiu's hunting expeditions to systematically organize the aquatic demon beasts he had recently captured.

The strength of demon beasts could generally be distinguished by the presence and power of their inner cores, but creatures of different sizes had varying abilities and characteristics, requiring different strategies when encountering them in battle.

Interestingly, aquatic creatures here seemed to easily become demon beasts, yet during this period, Zhang Jingxiu had only managed to hunt three with inner cores. Zhou Qing's compilation of aquatic demon beast information primarily focused on these three:

1. **Tigerhead Fish**: Head resembling a tiger's with a fish body, about the size of an actual tiger. Its fins were extremely sharp, it moved with great speed, and it had a vicious nature. Its weakness lay in its belly.

2. **Crimson Blood Dragonfish**: Entire body blood-red, up to ten zhang in length, with scales so tough that physical cultivators below the third level of Body Refining would struggle to penetrate them. However, the soft scales under its chin were its fatal weakness.

3. **Frost Odd Fish**: Could shoot ice blades, with a body harder than the Crimson Blood Dragonfish. Its strength was roughly equivalent to the first level of Body Refining, slightly slower than the Tigerhead Fish, and about three zhang in size. Its inner core had frost attributes that could calm the mind and slightly gather spiritual energy when carried.

These three aquatic species didn't exclusively appear within the three-hundred-li radius but had either wandered in while hunting or evading predators.

Additionally, Zhang Jingxiu had sensed danger in two locations at depths of at least a thousand zhang. Whenever he approached, he felt as if standing at a cliff's edge, his body uncontrollably pulled downward. As a Crucible Realm cultivator, he could easily resist the pull, but venturing further would likely be perilous.

Periodically, Zhou Qing would transport most of the aquatic demon beast carcasses back. Storage pouches could preserve the freshness of the corpses to some extent, and Zhou Qing had also derived a spell from the Heavenly Frost Fist technique—Frost Envelops the World. By casting it, he could freeze the carcasses with extreme cold.

While Frost Envelops the World was only moderately effective underwater, its power and range increased significantly on land, making it excellent for dealing with ordinary demon beasts.

Zhou Qing now intended to train a new assistant—the little snake.

Mao Ri was somewhat averse to aquatic environments, preferring mountainous forests, so it mainly served as a guard. The little snake, however, thrived in water.

Zhou Qing planned to enhance the snake's strength. By merging the Sacred Heart Art with the Demon Seed Gestation Technique and leveraging his powerful spiritual sense, he developed a beast-taming method. This allowed precise control over the snake and, through a spiritual imprint, enabled him to perceive its surroundings within a hundred-li range.

This was a semi-fusion, primarily manifesting as his spiritual sense merging with the snake's demonic soul. Given his current spiritual power, he could only spare a portion to control the snake. With more knowledge of beast-taming techniques, he could further refine this method.

Inside the underwater palace, Zhou Qing monitored the little snake's transformation through their spiritual connection. He had fed it the Frost Odd Fish's inner core, marking a significant evolution.

The core quickly dissolved within the snake, triggering the release of accumulated life essence from previously consumed demon beast flesh. Zhou Qing could sense the snake's body undergoing intense pain as new flesh rapidly grew. Its hisses deepened, carrying a draconic tone.

A mysterious force from the snake's bloodline activated, channeling the life essence to evolve it into a stronger demon beast. Cracking sounds echoed as its crimson scales shed, replaced by dark green, bone-like scales that visibly grew tougher and exuded a chilling aura.

"Not red anymore," Zhou Qing noted with surprise. The new scales were clearly more resilient and frost-imbued, likely influenced by the Frost Odd Fish's core. The snake, though previously red, had no fire attributes, relying instead on venomous fangs for offense.

As the snake evolved, Zhou Qing gleaned insights into frost-based Dao principles from its bloodline memories, transmitted through their spiritual link. These insights could enhance Frost Envelops the World, potentially developing it into a wide-ranging frost domain or barrier—especially useful in the mortal realm, where cold-aligned spells were potent due to inherent frost-related natural laws.

The transformation completed in about ten days. The snake remained one chi long, its strength doubling—though still only formidable among creatures of similar size. Its cold, piercing eyes now carried greater intimidation, and its speed had increased by half. A strike from Zhou Qing's Vajra Finger caused pain but left no damage, confirming the new scales' superior defense with room for further improvement. The protrusions on its head had also become more pronounced.

When Zhang Jingxiu returned from hunting, Zhou Qing suddenly warned, "Brother Dao, watch out!" A swift snake shot toward Zhang like a flying sword. Though Zhang's preternatural reflexes allowed him to dodge, he broke into a cold sweat. "Since when was this snake so strong?"

Zhou Qing laughed. "As expected of a Crucible Realm expert. The snake can only manage a sneak attack, and you still avoided it." The snake excelled as a hidden weapon but would be overpowered in direct combat against a third-level Body Refining cultivator. Its incredible defense and speed, however, made it difficult to fatally injure.

Mao Ri watched the snake warily, sensing a rival. If not for its aversion to water, the snake wouldn't have risen so easily. Still, as a veteran who had fought alongside the Tiger King, Mao Ri consoled itself—the snake was too small to serve as a mount anyway.

Zhang Jingxiu grinned at Zhou Qing's praise. "Did you think I was just hunting all this time? I've been honing my martial arts too. That lazy Fu Song still hasn't broken through to the Crucible Realm. At this rate, he'll stagnate."

Zhou Qing smiled. "It's been a while since I've stretched myself. How about we spar somewhere?" Fighting inside the palace would be too restrictive.

"Perfect. I found a good spot," Zhang replied.

They emerged onto the water's surface—staying submerged for long was stifling. Zhang often surfaced for air, and small islands dotted the area about a hundred li away. Skimming the water, they left white trails in their wake. The vast lake resembled an inland sea, with only one distant shore visible.

Upon reaching the scattered islands, Zhang said, "We can fight above or below."

Zhou Qing nodded. "Plenty of underwater reefs—complex terrain." The rocky islands were equally jagged and maze-like.

Landing amid the stone forest, Zhou Qing chuckled. "Testing my sword control in tight spaces, Brother Dao?"

Zhang grinned. "I need every advantage I can get." Before he finished speaking, Zhou Qing's Greenwood Sword shot forth. Zhang advanced instead of retreating—keeping distance would mean certain defeat. Though he knew Zhou Qing surpassed him in physical combat despite being a Qi cultivator, he had no better option.

Zhang dodged the sword's edge, weaving through the rocks to close in. Zhou Qing engaged him in close combat, their clashes sending shockwaves that toppled stone pillars. Soon, Zhou Qing disengaged, controlling the Greenwood Sword from afar. Zhang countered with blazing true energy that gradually weakened the sword's attacks.

Despite the fierce exchange, Zhou Qing remained in complete control. Suddenly, he transmitted a mental warning: "Brother, cease fighting and conceal your aura." He had long taught Zhang the Phantom Concealment technique, useful for hunting.

They hid their presence. Moments later, a flying vessel approached with four cultivators aboard.

"Strange," muttered a middle-aged man. "The spirit compass detected energy fluctuations from a battle, but there's nothing now."

A woman beside him pointed at the disturbed rocks. "Look below."

"Ah! They must have left," the man said. "Fighting so recklessly in the wild—do they not fear attracting powerful demon beasts?"

The woman frowned, then paled as a massive shadow loomed overhead—a giant avian creature with a wingspan of dozens of zhang, its head resembling a yaksha's, body tinged purple and green.

"Yaksha Eagle!"
