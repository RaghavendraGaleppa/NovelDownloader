**Chapter 6: The Golden Age**

Qin Ming’s heart stirred. Could the "technique" he was once told he couldn't master now be perfected and fully integrated?

He had returned from the wilderness, and a fiery glow seemed to burn within him, making even the bitter winter feel warm. The surge of strength throughout his body was no illusion; with a flick of his toe, he sent the stone roller in the courtyard airborne.

He leapt, feeling a strong sense of suspension, and snatched a handful of snow from the eaves.

As he exhaled, a white stream of air shot out, like a spear trailing a dense mist, emitting a loud whoosh as it cut through the air.

Qin Ming moved vigorously, using diaphragmatic breathing. His flickering figure stirred the accumulated snow from the ground into the air, causing the courtyard to be pelted anew with goose-feather snowflakes.

With every movement, his entire skeletal system responded. A horizontal sweep of his arm shattered all the dancing snowflakes in front of him.

His flesh and blood vitality increased significantly, his body felt scorching hot, and silvery patterns interlaced within his pores, drawing out copious amounts of sweat, as if purifying his body.

Qin Ming felt completely relaxed and comfortable, his entire being enveloped in a faint silver glow.

Such a phenomenon during "Newlife" was considered rare.

He trained for a long time, expending a great deal of energy, and only stopped when he truly felt exhausted.

Newlife was a process, and Qin Ming believed he was transforming, expecting his desires to be realized in the coming days.

He didn't return indoors, instead sitting quietly in the courtyard, allowing the stirred snow to fall upon him. He feared no bitter cold; his entire body felt warm and comfortable.

This was completely different from the past. When he was recovering from his illness, he would still feel cold even when wrapped in thick quilts on a heated kang bed.

Qin Ming closed his eyes, visualizing himself internally, repeating the difficult movements from earlier, engaging in consciousness force training.

The silver ripples that had just faded now reappeared. His breathing, guided by his thoughts, constantly adjusted, becoming exceptionally complex and difficult to discern any pattern.

Thought arose from the spirit, and Qi moved by will. As a result, the flowing light on his body brightened slightly.

The courtyard grew quiet, and Qin Ming was covered in snowflakes.

A long time passed until he stopped thinking, completely emptying his mind.

Only when the silver glow on his body completely vanished did he slowly open his eyes, sensing the changes within himself. He was certain that a vibrant Newlife force was burgeoning within his body.

Qin Ming calmly picked up the two-hundred-plus-jin millstone in the courtyard, then gently set it down.

"Newlife will most likely complete within two days," he mused, now having a clear idea.

At this moment, he felt an unsurprising, intense hunger.

Qin Ming cooked a pot of mushroom soup, making walnuts, almonds, and chestnuts his main meal, and treating red dates and hawthorn berries as side dishes. He ate with great enjoyment.

After sufficient rest, a new round of training began. He wanted to accelerate the "Newlife" process.

Qin Ming moved like a snapping bow, his actions like explosive thunder, stirring up the snowflakes across the entire courtyard. His flesh and blood vitality grew increasingly stronger.

And so, when he tired, he would nap; when hungry, he would feast on dried fruits; and after recovering his energy, he would train. From dusk till deep night, a vigorous life force continuously surged within him.

Before going to sleep, he washed himself with ice-cold water, feeling no chill. His tall, slender body, devoid of any excess fat, had tight muscles and smooth lines. His damp black hair glistened with water droplets, and under the fiery glow of a sunstone, his skin glowed brightly, exuding a sense of power.

During the night, he slept soundly, dreamless, sinking into the deepest level of sleep. As he was accelerating his Newlife, his body continuously brimmed with fresh vitality.

The next day, Qin Ming's appetite greatly increased, and he was already eating seven meals.

The main reason was the considerable energy expenditure of this postnatal transformation.

Even the most delicious food grew tiresome after so many consecutive meals, especially since it was all dried goods that he needed to consume with hot water.

"What a pity, there aren't many mushrooms left. I can't even make some fresh soup," Qin Ming lamented.

What made him frown was that his food reserves weren't much; at this rate, they would only last another day.

"Am I a bottomless pit? Half a beast-hide bag of dried goods only lasted three days," Qin Ming muttered to himself.

The "technique" aiding his Newlife could not stop. When still, he was like a towering mountain; when moving, he was like an eagle soaring through the sky. The silver light emerging from his pores grew increasingly intense.

He genuinely felt his physical capabilities strengthening, not in an instant, but through gradual changes.

Qin Ming walked to one side of the small courtyard and attempted to lift both millstones together. With a sudden burst of strength, he actually managed to move them from their spot.

Lu Ze happened to push open the courtyard gate and entered, instantly dumbfounded.

"Little Qin, what is this..." he exclaimed, his face filled with surprise. Just yesterday, he had felt sorry for Qin Ming, believing he would miss the Newlife in his golden age, and today he witnessed such a sight.

In the courtyard separated by a wall, Liang Wanqing also came over upon hearing the commotion and was stunned when she realized what had happened.

"Just like Er Bingzi from the neighboring village, he can lift over four hundred *jin* of heavy objects right after Newlife," Lu Ze genuinely rejoiced for Qin Ming.

"Newlife in the Golden Age, Little Qin truly did it," Liang Wanqing said, noting that in all these years, he was the first in Twin Trees Village to achieve this.

"Uncle, you're amazing!" Wen Rui also ran over, his big eyes sparkling as he looked up at him, his small face full of admiration.

"I feel that the Newlife changes are still ongoing," Qin Ming said.

He had already realized that the process would exceed his earlier estimates and was far from over.

Liang Wanqing, with a look of astonishment, said, "In our region, even for those who achieve Newlife during the Golden Age, lifting five hundred *jin* after stabilization is the limit. Little Qin couldn't possibly be approaching that, could he?"

"It's said that in that bright city far away, there are youths who can lift six hundred *jin*," Lu Ze said, eager to know what heights Qin Ming would reach once his Newlife transformation concluded.

A sudden clamor arose from the street.

Liang Wanqing went out and quickly returned, saying, "Old Granny Zhou's health has failed."

Qin Ming had seen her on the road just yesterday. Recalling her frail body and pallid face, her condition had indeed seemed very unwell.

"What's the reason?" Lu Ze asked.

Liang Wanqing sighed, "It's said she hasn't eaten enough recently, coupled with her already poor health, which led to this problem."

Qin Ming and Lu Ze went to the street and learned the details.

Old Granny Zhou's son had gone out some time ago, but returned without food and was severely injured himself, with a broken bone in his right arm.

This winter, every household was short on food. With the pillar of her family incapacitated, Old Granny Zhou was consumed with worry. Every day, she quietly set aside the food she was supposed to eat, taking only a small amount to fill her stomach.

Many people had already gathered in the Zhou family's courtyard. After Qin Ming and Lu Ze entered the house, they saw Old Granny Zhou lying motionless, her face waxy and yellow, without a sound.

Two children were weeping, kneeling nearby, loudly crying out for their grandmother.

Before Old Granny Zhou passed away, she told them where to find food—some ground potatoes and hard, cold steamed buns that she had hidden in bamboo baskets under the ice and snow.

As for the nuts Qin Ming had given her, she hadn't even brought herself to eat a single one.

It was only today that her family learned she had been frugal, deliberately saving her own rations. She worried that her heavily injured son, Zhou Changyu, would no longer be able to bring back food, and feared her grandchildren would starve. She herself would rather eat less or not at all.

Zhou Changyu, learning the truth, was heartbroken. The man, nearly thirty years old, was in tears, slapping his own face forcefully, saying he was useless and unfilial for not discovering this sooner.

His wife also knelt there, sobbing uncontrollably.

Many people in the courtyard sighed. In such a year, the entire region was suffering from disaster, with everyone lacking clothes and food, making life very difficult.

Qin Ming felt a lump in his throat. Just two days ago, when he saw the pallid Old Granny Zhou, she had tremblingly taken out a few dried ground potato pieces and tried to press them into his hand.

Now, he didn't even need to think to know that those were the rations she had routinely and secretly saved every day.

Such a kind old woman, gone just like that. Qin Ming stood in silence for a long time.

After dusk, the people in the courtyard gradually dispersed. Qin Ming returned, carrying a cloth bag containing five *jin* of nuts, which he handed to Zhou Changyu, asking him to control his grief.

"Brother Qin!" Zhou Changyu, his eyes red, tried to refuse. He knew how difficult it was to find food in the wilderness these days.

Qin Ming placed it in his hand, urged him to accept it, and turned to leave.

It was already very late, and the sounds of weeping could still be heard from the Zhou family's home.

Qin Ming sat in the dark courtyard. Others still had relatives to mourn, but what about him? The few unclear faces in his mind grew increasingly blurry. He feared that one day he would completely forget them, losing every last memory.

On this cold winter night, he gazed up at the night sky, seeing nothing, lost in thought for a long time, feeling an inexpressible sense of loneliness.

In his mind, there was a hazy lamplight, and faint figures. He wanted to get closer to see clearly, but he could never touch those childhood memories that had long faded.

Suddenly, a heart-palpitating aura washed over him, incredibly oppressive, causing Qin Ming's body to instantly tense. In the pitch-black night sky, where he couldn't see his hand in front of his face, two golden lanterns actually appeared, mysterious and awe-inspiring!

Then, the peaceful winter night erupted into a wild gale. All the snowflakes on the ground surged violently upwards, and the rooftops seemed as if they would be torn off, shaking violently.

Across the abyssal black night sky, the pair of golden lanterns swept by, accompanied by fierce winds, exuding an incredibly terrifying oppressive force that almost made one suffocate!

Qin Ming's pupils contracted. He guessed it must be a higher being, impossibly massive, flapping its wings like dark clouds blotting out the sky as it passed over Twin Trees Village.

The golden lanterns were its eyes. As it moved further away, the sudden storm quickly weakened, then dissipated.

A stir rippled through the village. Many people came out, discussing what had happened.

The older villagers, who had experienced similar events, though solemn, told the younger generation not to panic, explaining that it was likely just a higher being passing through on its journey.

Qin Ming returned from the street and sat in the courtyard for a long time, gazing at the boundless night sky.

Night enveloped the world, blocking the paths to distant places, making this world even more mysterious. Waves rippled in his heart; he truly wanted to go out and see the vast lands for himself.

Finally, he stood up resolutely and practiced the specific sets of movements he remembered most clearly from his childhood.

Even with a desire in his heart, he needed strength to achieve it.

Gradually, a vigorous Newlife force emerged from his body, and a faint mist of light appeared on his skin.

A long time later, he felt an unprecedented hunger. The Newlife transformation had not stopped; in fact, it seemed to be intensifying.

Qin Ming ate a pile of dried goods with hot water, but still didn't feel full.

When images of mutated squirrels and the black mountain goat from Yang Yongqing's house by the village entrance appeared in his mind, he couldn't help but swallow.

He genuinely craved meat; just thinking about it made him feel as if he could smell the rich aroma of cooked meat. He realized this was his body signaling that it needed nourishment.

Only after Qin Ming ate yet another pile of nuts did that abnormal craving slowly subside.

"It seems I'll have to go into the mountains again once dusk falls," he thought. He needed to satisfy his body's demands to ensure his Newlife proceeded without any issues.

In fact, after he gave five *jin* of dried goods to the Zhou family, his own food reserves were no longer very abundant.

He awoke early after a dreamless night. Although his stomach was very hungry, his spirit was exceptionally vigorous. He had a feeling that with the ongoing Newlife transformation, he should now be able to lift over five hundred *jin*.

"Most importantly, Newlife is still ongoing." This made him intensely curious about what level he would ultimately reach.

He began to stretch his muscles and bones.

Next, Qin Ming performed the Dragon Spine technique: first, he arched his waist forward, then forcefully bent backward, making his entire spine form an exaggerated crescent-like curve in reverse. His vertebrae popped loudly all the way up, and his flesh and blood vibrated intensely with them.

Starting from his tailbone, Yang energy surged forth, climbing all the way up his Dragon Spine until it reached his head.

Qin Ming's entire body tingled, as if an electric current was passing through him. All his pores opened, and his whole body felt warm and comfortable, enveloped by Yang energy.

At the same time, a layer of silver light rippled on his body's surface, clearer than ever before.

Undoubtedly, this significantly accelerated the Newlife process!

Before dusk had fully arrived, Qin Ming was already outside the village. Various dried fruits could no longer satisfy his needs; his appetite seemed insatiable.

The thought of rock goats, night deer, and black-feathered pheasants roasting over a bonfire, their fat sizzling and dripping onto the embers, made him unable to resist. His mouth watered, and wind seemed to gather under his feet as he wished he could instantly rush into the dense wilderness forest.
