# Chapter 570: Master of the Heavenly Realm

He simply raised the True Martial Sword in his hand high, pointing it directly at the heavens to command the great array.

It was as if he held a scepter that commanded the authority of thunder.

*Hummm!!!*

The array disc high in the sky spun rapidly, unleashing a brilliance more piercing than ever before.

The Five Elements Heavenly Thunder, which had accumulated to their peak and already caused the entire battlefield's spiritual energy to twist and crack, found their most violent outlet.

*BOOM!!!*

A sound too immense for words!

A thunderbolt that seemed to split the heavens and earth tore through the tranquility of the "Heavenly Realm."

It was no longer a serpent of lightning, but an ocean of thunder.

The apocalyptic storm of five-colored lightning, like a celestial river pouring down or a divine spear cast by the heavens to destroy the world, tore through the thick clouds. Ignoring the barriers of space and time, it descended ferociously under the guidance of the True Martial Sword raised by Xu Yunfan.

The moment the thunder descended, Nezha's three pairs of eyes widened simultaneously. The overwhelming divine light from his six treasures was instantly swallowed by the merciless ocean of thunder.

The moment his colossal three-headed, six-armed golden body came into contact with the torrent of Five Thunders, the divine power barrier he was so proud of shattered like paper. His sturdy physical form cracked and charred inch by inch.

"Argh!!"

Nezha could only let out a miserable scream before his three-headed, six-armed golden body completely disintegrated within the five-colored thunderstorm. Even his soul failed to escape, utterly annihilated within the resplendent heavenly thunder.

*'You have successfully killed a先天神圣 (Primordial Divine). Proficiency in the Divine霄九宸玄穹不灭真经 (Mystic Firmament Nine Heavens True Scripture of the Unfailing Void) has increased.'*

Xu Yunfan's gaze was as cold as ice. He glanced at the attribute panel in his vision, then turned his eyes to the still considerable number of Heavenly Soldiers and Generals. With a flick of the True Martial Sword in his hand, the Nine Heavens Five Thunders Yin-Yang Chaos Spirit Suppression Array disc suspended high in the sky began to spin violently.

The thunder that filled the sky surged back like a torrent, transforming into billions of interwoven lightning serpents that descended upon the tens of thousands of remaining Heavenly Soldiers and Generals in the sea of clouds.

*Crash-boom!*

Lightning rampaged, and silver armor shattered.

The once solemn and majestic battle formation of the Heavenly Soldiers was devoured by the violent sea of thunder in an instant.

The smell of scorching flesh mixed with the piercing shriek of dissipating spiritual energy filled the air. The immortal light dimmed, and the banners were incinerated. The last vestiges of resistance melted away like snow.

In less than the time it took to drink a cup of tea, the one hundred thousand Heavenly Soldiers were reduced to ash.

The thick scent of blood mixed with the burnt odor of thunder, forming a solemn, reddish mist that shrouded the mountains and forests below.

Xu Yunfan stood atop the remnant clouds. His divine sense swept over the devastated battlefield. More than half of the Qi-refining disciples from the Primordial Origin Sect had been lost. The survivors, like bloodthirsty hyenas, their eyes already red, were led by a few Foundation Establishment True Masters and transformed into streaks of flowing light, howling as they charged towards the magnificent, immeasurably clear-glowing giant gate deep within the clouds.

The Southern Heavenly Gate!

The shouts of battle shook the heavens and the earth as they charged straight into the Heavenly Court.

These people, including those few Foundation Establishment True Masters, naturally knew that sweeping through the inside would yield great opportunities.

Xu Yunfan paid them no mind.

The honor of being the first to ascend was now as easy as taking something from a bag. His true target was the supreme foundation nurtured by this Heavenly Realm.

The World Root Qi.

In the Taihua Lingxu Realm, if one wanted to pluck the Root Qi, the moment they made a move, the heavens' gaze would fall upon them in the next instant. And in the instant after that, endless calamities and miasmic qi would descend upon their body, bringing the Five Decays of the Heavens and Man.

It was incredibly difficult to survive.

Generally, Foundation Establishment True Masters pluck World Root Qi in other realms.

After all, as an Outer Realm Demon, it is only natural to devour the World Root Qi of a realm.

Xu Yunfan did not hesitate.

"洞冥蚀天箓 (Mysterious Nether Devouring Heaven Talisman)."

"青龙雷珠锁劫镇运 (Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Locks Calamity and Suppresses Fate)!"

His hands formed seals at lightning speed. A faint, grayish mist circulated around him, and subtle azure thunder patterns as fine as dragons and snakes flashed and vanished within the folds of his robes.

Two secret techniques operated simultaneously. His own aura and traces, as well as his karmic connection to this heaven and earth, instantly became blurred and indistinct, like a drop of ink falling into a vast ocean, quickly fading away.

The malicious intent directed at him that permeated the world slightly stagnated.

It was now.

Xu Yunfan's figure flickered, landing in a valley torn apart by the great battle, its earth veins shattered.

Here, the spiritual energy was as thick as substance, and below, it seemed as if a dragon's vein was dormant and groaning. It was the perfect node to absorb the World Root Qi.

He sat cross-legged in mid-air, palms facing upward, fingers spread. The true words from his mouth vibrated like thunderous drums. A phantom, chaotic microcosm appeared around him, its aura ancient and primordial—this was the proto-grotto-heaven he had forged.

Fine, faint golden streams of air, invisible to the naked eye but bearing the imprints of the world's laws, were forcibly pulled from the depths of the shattered earth, from chaotic void nodes, and even from the dissipating spiritual essence of the fallen Heavenly Soldiers and Generals.

The proto-grotto-heaven floating around Xu Yunfan pulsed like a heart, and an inexplicable energy suddenly rippled outwards. Then, as the proto-grotto-heaven contracted, it began to draw in the streams of Qi.

They swarmed into the proto-grotto-heaven above Xu Yunfan's palms like fish returning to their nest.

*Hummm...*

The proto-grotto-heaven trembled violently, emitting a low, resonant hum.

Its originally illusory and unstable edges, after absorbing this pure World Root Qi, rapidly became solid. The chaotic-colored soil within grew even more substantial, and the purple origin point at its core that carried the Divine Thunder became even more dazzling. A majestic, oppressive might was contained within, as the proto-grotto-heaven took a solid step towards stability and perfection.

Xu Yunfan's mind was immersed within it, feeling his connection to this grotto-heaven become even closer and more complete. It was like a chaotic egg waiting to hatch, feeding back immense vitality and power to compensate for the消耗 from his previous great battle.

However, such an act of stealing from the heavens could not last.

In less than half a quarter of an hour, the world's malice intensified suddenly, like ice wrapping around him.

Xu Yunfan frowned. It seemed the concealment from his two secret techniques had reached its limit.

The sky above the valley seemed to open an invisible giant eye, locking tightly onto his position.

The wind ceased, birds and beasts vanished, and even the rich spiritual energy of the world became stagnant and heavy. Breathing came with an invisible resistance.

The Dao of this realm had completely locked onto this Outer Realm Demon who was stealing its Root Qi.

Xu Yunfan's eyes snapped open, a flash of lightning within them. He immediately ceased any hesitation, preparing to tear through space and flee, to go into hiding once more.

This place was not suitable for a long stay.

He would find another place to lie low, and once this realm's Dao could not find him, he could resume his absorption.

Just as he was about to move.

*BOOM!*

An indescribable, terrifying pressure that shook the entire Heavenly Realm and its乾坤 (universe) erupted from the depths of the magnificent Heavenly Court suspended high in the nine heavens.

Xu Yunfan looked up sharply, his expression grave.

This was a supreme might that transcended the Foundation Establishment level, containing immeasurable magical power, and even the collision of fruit-level powers.

Countless golden halls and jade palaces twisted and trembled in the shockwave. The clear qi that filled the sky surged like a raging sea, but was firmly held back by an equally terrifying killing intent.

A grand figure, shrouded in immeasurable clear light, was seen atop the firmament. With every movement, it drew upon the vast clear qi of the universe, evolving the true meaning of the myriad Dao techniques. With a single palm strike, it seemed as if the entire sky pressed down with it. It was none other than the Master of this realm, the Heavenly Emperor.
