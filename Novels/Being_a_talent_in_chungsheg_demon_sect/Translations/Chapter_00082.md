# Chapter 82: Negotiating with a Tiger

Unlike Zhao Xuhe and Lu Yuanchun, Luo Wuya was not a lecherous man. Thus, he had been observing the scene in secret with his spiritual sense from beginning to end.

However, even so, when he saw the woman who had been as cool and pure as a snow lotus at the banquet now lying disheveled on the bed, her robes in disorder, like a trampled flower, with even tear stains on her delicate face, the strong contrast still couldn't help but stir something unusual within him.

"Junior Sister Yu..."

Luo Wuya took a deep breath, then waved his hand. A ray of shimmering light enveloped Yu Suzhen, somewhat alleviating the awkward atmosphere between them.

Luo Wuya clearly saw a hint of relief and gratitude on Yu Suzhen's face.

But soon, her expression turned to helplessness and self-mockery: "I didn't expect to become a laughingstock for Senior Brother... Please, Senior Brother, do not spread this matter."

"Junior Sister Yu, you worry too much."

Luo Wuya sighed. He had been a bystander from beginning to end, and although he didn't know the specifics, he was sure that Yu Suzhen had most likely been coerced by Lu Yuanchun.

"I will keep this matter confidential for Junior Sister."

"Thank you, Senior Brother..."

As soon as these words were spoken, Yu Suzhen's beautiful face grew even more bitter, her lovely eyes reddened, and she looked like a pear blossom bathed in rain. Between her glances, a thousand sorrows and myriad grievances seemed to brew.

Soon, Luo Wuya learned the full story.

"So that's it... Junior Sister Yu and Junior Brother Zhao were originally deeply in love. Later, Junior Brother Zhao was accepted as a disciple by the Heaven-Mending Peak Master, but Junior Brother Lu interfered and caused trouble. For Junior Brother Zhao's sake, you went to reason with him, but you were entrapped by him, lost your innocence, and he gained leverage, which is why you've fallen to this state..."

Luo Wuya looked at Yu Suzhen and sighed.

As the second senior brother of the Three Rivers Society, he naturally knew that Zhao Xuhe was now the Heaven-Mending Peak Master's chosen son-in-law. How could he possibly form a dao-partner relationship with an outsider?

Undoubtedly, Yu Suzhen's feelings had been deceived.

At the same time, Yu Suzhen struggled to support herself and whispered, "Senior Brother, it's late now. I need to rest. Please don't take offense, Senior Brother."

"I understand."

Luo Wuya nodded, naturally seeing Yu Suzhen's predicament. He wanted to help but didn't want to get involved in this muddy situation, so he could only sigh.

"I, Luo, will take my leave."

With that, he turned and departed.

After he left, Yu Suzhen slowly got up and sealed her immortal abode. The sorrow and grief on her face quickly receded, replaced by an expression of indifference.

"...This should work."

Zhao Xuhe, Lu Yuanchun, Luo Wuya—these were the three big fish Yu Suzhen had set her sights on during this period. For them, she had specially devised three different strategies.

The strategies differed for different people.

For instance, with Zhao Xuhe, Yu Suzhen had determined he was inherently a man of many loves, so she deliberately pretended to fall in love with him, willingly becoming his secret lover.

As for Lu Yuanchun, Yu Suzhen had tested him multiple times and saw that he secretly envied Zhao Xuhe's favor with the Heaven-Mending Peak Master. So, she deliberately went to him under the guise of being Zhao Xuhe's dao-partner. One wanted to strike, the other was willing to take it, and naturally, they smoothly hooked up.

As for Luo Wuya, Yu Suzhen's strategy was different again.

After all, Luo Wuya was unlike the previous two; he was at the perfected Qi Condensation stage, aiming for Foundation Establishment. To him, feminine charms were, if not outright 'red dust skeletons' (illusory beauty hiding decay), then close enough.

Such people sought emotional value.

To put it plainly, it was like convincing a fallen woman to lead an honest life. If Luo Wuya truly became fixated on this, he would have bitten the bait, and Yu Suzhen would naturally know how to control him.

If he didn't become fixated but genuinely intended to stay out of it, that was fine too. After all, he was just a backup. Yu Suzhen wouldn't bother him; her 'fish pond' was vast, and she wasn't lacking this one big fish. All their previous interactions would just be considered forming a good connection, which might yield unexpected benefits in time.

Prescribing the right medicine for the ailment, serving dishes according to the guest's taste.

This was Yu Suzhen's self-cultivation as a 'sea king' (player). And these were just the big fish; she also had many smaller fish utterly devoted to her.

If not for this, how could her cultivation progress by leaps and bounds?

"Incredible, incredible."

Inside Skeleton Mountain, even Lu Yang couldn't help but marvel at Yu Suzhen's extraordinary talent and unique approach. If this continued, she might really ensnare all the disciples.

"It's just a pity, her actions are still too grand."

Lu Yang formed a hand seal with one hand, and a round light spun behind him, reflecting countless possible events, all of which pointed to a single outcome—

"What are you doing?"

In an instant, the sudden voice startled Yu Suzhen, making her spin her head around. Even Lu Yang, who was prepared, swallowed hard.

A young man, dressed in black and white daoist robes, with a youthful face and hair like a crane's, possessing a transcendent bearing, appeared in Yu Suzhen's immortal abode without any warning. A kind smile graced his face, yet his eyes were icy cold, fixed directly on Yu Suzhen, as if he could see through her very soul.

At that moment, Yu Suzhen's delicate face froze in place.

Not only that, but even her thoughts, intentions, and even her fears were frozen simultaneously, as if she had instantly transformed into a rigid stone statue.

This was merely the aftershock.

Because at this very moment, the Heaven-Mending Peak Master wasn't looking at her. The spiritual sense attached to his gaze was truly locked onto Lu Yang, who was behind her!

"Which fellow Daoist dares to scheme against my disciples?"

"From where did you obtain the Heaven-Stealing Art?"

Facing the Heaven-Mending Peak Master's questions, Lu Yang remained calm. He wasn't surprised by the Peak Master's appearance, after all, Zhao Xuhe and Lu Yuanchun were both his disciples.

Moreover, he had obtained the Heaven-Stealing Art from Zhao Xuhe in his previous life.

However, where had Zhao Xuhe obtained such a profound secret art? Considering the characteristics of this art, the answer was self-evident.

This was actually created by the Heaven-Mending Peak Master!

Therefore, ever since he began to cultivate Yu Suzhen into a Child of Destiny, Lu Yang had been prepared for the Heaven-Mending Peak Master to discover him and come knocking.

Of course, he couldn't meet the Heaven-Mending Peak Master in person.

So he could only make Yu Suzhen suffer a little, using her as bait to lure out the Heaven-Mending Peak Master, and then meet the Peak Master through her.

"...Insignificant tricks, Senior, please forgive my presumption."

With a thought, Lu Yang activated the Heaven-Stealing Art, directly taking over Yu Suzhen's body. He chuckled lightly, "I merely wish to discuss a transaction with Senior."

"...It's you?"

Before Lu Yang had finished speaking, the Heaven-Mending Peak Master raised an eyebrow: "That day, it wasn't Grandmaster Hongyun, but you who secretly seized Daoist Panlong's karmic inheritance?"

Immediately after, the Heaven-Mending Peak Master showed no anger, but instead smiled: "Interesting."

"What makes you qualified to bargain with me?"

"By Senior's blood relative."

Lu Yang calmly stated, "Senior Brother Chen was saved by me, and now there's still a glimmer of hope for his rebirth. Senior wouldn't want to see your son's soul scatter, would you?"

"Xinan!?"

As soon as these words were uttered, the Heaven-Mending Peak Master's expression instantly changed.

He immediately began to deduce karma. Soon, Chen Xinan, who had lost the protection of the divine talismans, was uncovered by him.

However, no matter how he calculated the heavenly secrets, he could not obtain any further information, nor could he ascertain Chen Xinan's current state.

This only made the Heaven-Mending Peak Master even more curious. After all, to be able to block his heavenly divination indicated that either there was another Foundation Establishment Grandmaster behind the opponent, or they possessed a wondrous heavenly artifact. Regardless of which it was, for this person to dare threaten him, it was truly audacious.

Truly worthy of being a disciple of my Saint Sect!

"...Speak then."

A moment later, the Heaven-Mending Peak Master finally spoke: "What do you want in exchange for returning Xinan? A wondrous Foundation Establishment item? Or a great divine ability..."

"Neither."

Lu Yang shook his head: "I plan to have Yu Suzhen control Xiao Shiye using the Heaven-Stealing Art, but I need a Senior to conceal the karma for Yu Suzhen."

"...Oh?"

As soon as these words were spoken, the Heaven-Mending Peak Master's expression finally changed significantly. He looked at Lu Yang with keen interest: "You want to scheme against Grandmaster Hongyun?"

Lu Yang smiled: "Precisely!"

Xiao Shiye was Daoist Hongyun's bait. If Yu Suzhen rashly controlled him, it would certainly be discovered, and Lu Yang himself couldn't conceal the heavenly secrets.

Therefore, to snatch food from a tiger's mouth, the only way was to find a Foundation Establishment Grandmaster to cooperate with. The Heaven-Mending Peak Master was undoubtedly the most suitable candidate. On one hand, there was Chen Xinan as a hostage, and on the other hand, the Heaven-Mending Peak Master's relationship with Daoist Hongyun was clearly not good.

Of course, Lu Yang was also well aware of the risks of cooperating with the Heaven-Mending Peak Master.

One careless move, and the cooperation could turn into a double-cross.

This was a negotiation with a tiger!
