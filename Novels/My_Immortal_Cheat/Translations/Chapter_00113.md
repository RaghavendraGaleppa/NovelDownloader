## Chapter 113: Cleansing the Eyes

Mu Su didn't harbor any hatred towards the other realms for jointly attacking the Divine Realm in ancient times. Perhaps it was because too much time had passed, or perhaps it was because Mu Su felt no sense of belonging to the so-called Divine Realm. If the few great sects remaining from antiquity were already like this, it wasn't hard to imagine how much more so the ancient Divine Realm, where the Divine Dao flourished, must have been.

After a discussion, the two headed towards Mount Myriad Gods. All the astonishing phenomena had vanished by now, leaving only a single pillar of light that still pierced the heavens and earth, connecting to an unseen, unknowable place, guiding those who rushed towards it.

The news of the Myriad Gods Hall reopening exploded like a bomb across the God-Forsaken Land, instantly stirring countless hearts. This was no longer the flourishing Divine Realm of ancient times; the gods had vanished, and miracles were no longer manifest. Not everyone's faith was so pure; if they could become gods themselves, it seemed like a good alternative.

From Zhou Tian and Mu Su's perspective, their current location didn't seem too far, but that was actually due to the immense height of Mount Myriad Gods. Endless mountain ranges stretched out from Mount Myriad Gods. Although none of the other peaks were as tall as Mount Myriad Gods, differing vastly in size, they were still incredibly majestic and perilous, like sharp swords piercing the sky. Every ancient tree was thick and towering; even the vines coiling around their bark were as thick as a fist, dappled with golden spots. Their crowns spread like umbrellas, allowing only sparse moonlight to filter through the gaps.

Within the myriad peaks and valleys, fierce beasts roamed freely, and primeval ferocious beasts emerged. Various terrifying sounds rose and fell, shaking the rivers and mountains, making all the trees tremble and scattering leaves flutter down. The Myriad Gods Mountain Range had been unmanaged for countless years. Many incredibly powerful fierce beasts had reappeared. In ancient times, even an ordinary person could travel freely through the Myriad Gods Mountain Range, but now, even a relatively strong sect like the Holy God Sect dared not venture too deep.

Zhou Tian and Mu Su chose a direction. Mu Su had lived here for many years. Although he hadn't delved deep, he was quite familiar with some of the surface paths.

Rumble!

Mu Su watched as ten thousand bolts of lightning descended in the distant sky, like an ancient雷狱 (Lei Yu - Lightning Purgatory) arriving. The nearby sky was overcast, dark clouds churning, and thick, dragon-like lightning bolts weaved through them. That was a supremely powerful fierce beast nearby, whose territory was incredibly vast. Its body was as tall as a mountain, on all fours, with blue skin all over. Its head resembled a lion's, its fur was golden with electric arcs mixed in, and the tip of its tail had a white hammer-like growth, wrapped in lightning glow.

"Roar!"

A earth-shattering beast roar, accompanied by an incredibly thick pillar of lightning, its purple light dazzling. But to Mu Su's surprise, this powerful attack instantly vanished without displaying its astonishing destructive power. A moment later, a figure appeared before Mu Su, completely naked, his bare backside exposed. Mu Su's eye twitched. Although this wasn't the first time he'd witnessed it, each time made him feel as if his eyes were being defiled.

This figure was none other than Zhou Tian, who now wore an expression of profound satisfaction, as if he'd just relieved himself after a week of constipation. With practiced familiarity, he took the clothes from Mu Su's hand and put them on.

"You..."

Mu Su was interrupted by Zhou Tian before he could speak.

"What is wrong with you? Why do you always have to provoke those fierce beasts, and why do you never wear clothes when you do it?"

Zhou Tian mumbled with irritating familiarity, "I say, big brother, do you really need to ask the same question every time? Haven't I told you? I was born to seek excitement. If I don't seek a bit of excitement each day, I feel uncomfortable all over. It's the same principle as how you always need to 'cleanse your eyes' after seeing my perfect naked body."

Mu Su's face was speechless, wearing an expression that said, 'I'd believe a ghost before I believe you.'

"Alright, let's go." Zhou Tian called out, then opened his Undying System. After days of persistent effort, his death count had increased by another seven. The 'Level' column had become: 8/16, meaning eight more deaths and he would be able to level up again.

After Mu Su had "cleansed his eyes," the two of them resumed their journey. As they delved deeper, the scenery in the mountain range became increasingly dark and dangerous, the forest almost completely blocking out all light.

Bang!

A warg-like creature, several tens of feet tall, sprang out of the forest. Its fur was pitch black and bristled, and it bared its fangs, staring at them. Green saliva dripped down, corroding small pits in the ground.

Boom!

A thick pillar of lightning shot out from Zhou Tian's hand. The warg vanished before it could even utter a roar, and a scent of cooked meat wafted through the air.

"Have you decided what kind of god you want to be yet? Otherwise, the Holy God Lord's divine position wouldn't be bad; it's quite imposing. Too bad he hasn't fallen yet." Zhou Tian asked, a hint of regret in his voice, as if nothing had just happened.

"Everything is still unknown. It's too early to think so much," Mu Su said helplessly. Zhou Tian made it sound as simple as drinking soup. Why didn't he ask what method was suitable for killing the Holy God Lord instead? Although Mu Su could tell that the lightning pillar Zhou Tian had just unleashed was very similar to the one the fierce beast had created, he also knew Zhou Tian would definitely not explain, so he didn't bother to ask.

"With my help, you'll definitely succeed, don't worry," Zhou Tian patted Mu Su's shoulder, wearing a look that said, 'Leave it to me.'

Mu Su's cheek twitched. It was precisely *because* of Zhou Tian's help that he felt so unsettled.

The two chatted idly, when suddenly, the light in the forest brightened. The sunrise had arrived, and the sky was once again filled with dazzling sunlight.

"Here, take my clothes. Watch them carefully, this is my only set. If they're gone, I'll strip the clothes right off your back."

As the next refresh for death counts approached, Zhou Tian intended to use up his daily death allowance. He handed his removed clothes to Mu Su, meticulously instructing him, not forgetting to add a threat at the end. Neither of them possessed any spatial storage items. Zhou Tian's clothes had been bought in Seiler City using Mu Su's money; they were already tattered but still wearable. If they were to break, he'd be forced to go around naked, which would be quite embarrassing for him.

Mu Su nodded with a resigned, lifeless expression.

"Hehehe." Zhou Tian rubbed his hands, revealing a sly grin, and vanished from the spot.

"Where's that big guy I just saw?" Zhou Tian searched all over the forest. The density of fierce beasts in the Myriad Gods Mountain Range was relatively high; if he wanted to court death, he wouldn't have to worry about not finding a fierce beast.

Zhou Tian's naked figure flashed continuously through the forest, and he quickly found the enormous creature he had just seen. It was a creature with dark wings, its body stood erect like a human's, its four limbs possessed sharp claws, its entire body was covered in purple scales, and it had two goat horns on its head. Its beast eyes were incredibly dark.
