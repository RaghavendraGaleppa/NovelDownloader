# Chapter 25: Seizing the Bone  

"That damned woman—she's ruthless enough to even take on a Three-Eyed Crimson Hound! But her absorption technique is truly domineering, forcefully suppressing it!"  

Wang Chan muttered to himself before quickly regaining his composure and continuing to observe.  

As expected, the same scene from before repeated itself—  

Madam Cheng and the Three-Eyed Crimson Hound were locked in a bizarre entanglement.  

This close-quarters battle was a test of endurance.  

"If I were to release two black needles now and vaporize them, this would be the perfect chance to finish them both."  

Wang Chan's fingers itched with temptation.  

Unfortunately, he and Madam Cheng were bound by a Heart Demon Oath, preventing him from outright killing her.  

But his goal wasn't to kill her—or the dog.  

He immediately activated the mid-grade Diamond Talisman pressed against his chest, enveloping himself in a thick golden barrier.  

Glancing at the glowing golden runes swirling across the barrier, Wang Chan felt a surge of confidence.  

Taking a deep breath, he dashed into the valley, heading straight for the corpse of the Flood Dragon-Tiger.  

His sudden appearance startled Madam Cheng, while the suppressed Three-Eyed Crimson Hound could only widen its eyes in shock, unable to make a sound.  

Only after recognizing Wang Chan did Madam Cheng's panic turn to relief.  

"Brother Wang, you came at the perfect time! Just like last time, use your needle to break this… this beast's Yin Heel Acupoint!" she urged, her voice a mix of urgency and embarrassment.  

Wang Chan ignored her. Instead, he channeled his magic power into his palm and ran his hand over the Flood Dragon-Tiger's corpse, swiftly searching for its high-grade demon bone.  

"Brother Wang, this beast's body is incredibly tough, and I'm already poisoned by its crimson venom. If you don't act now, I won't be able to suppress it much longer. If my technique backfires, my foundation will be ruined, and I'll never have a chance at Foundation Building again..."  

Seeing that Wang Chan still paid her no mind, Madam Cheng adopted a pitiful tone laced with threat: "If that happens, our Heart Demon Oath will mean nothing!"  

Hearing her threat, Wang Chan sneered. "If you survive this, Madam Cheng, feel free to come for revenge."  

In the past, he had no choice—he was too weak.  

But now, with the black and white needles as his trump cards, he wasn't necessarily afraid of her. If she broke the oath first, he could kill her without hesitation and eliminate the threat for good.  

Especially after obtaining this high-grade demon bone—his combat power would only grow stronger.  

Just then, Wang Chan's roaming hand suddenly stopped. His eyes lit up with excitement.  

The Flood Dragon-Tiger's high-grade demon bone was actually its horn!  

Outwardly, the horn looked as unremarkable as an ox's, but inside, it was engraved with profound mystical patterns.  

---  

As expected, the high-grade demon bone was hidden within the horn.  

Without wasting another second, Wang Chan grabbed the horn and yanked hard—but it didn't budge.  

He then pulled out a spirit blade from his storage pouch, intending to either cut off the horn or the beast's head, but the blade couldn't even leave a scratch.  

"As expected of a high-bloodline demon beast! Even though it's only at the low-grade stage, its body rivals that of a mid-grade demon beast!"  

Refusing to give up, Wang Chan summoned a white needle. After a brief hover, it shot straight into the base of the horn.  

The white needle, imbued with thunder-attribute power, pierced effortlessly into the Flood Dragon-Tiger's skull, leaving a deep hole—though it couldn't sever the entire head.  

But that was fine. If one strike wasn't enough, he'd try again.  

Three strikes later, Wang Chan finally held the intact horn in his hand. Rough and heavy, it exuded an intimidating aura.  

He swiftly stored it in a jade box and tucked it into his storage pouch.  

His gaze then swept over the rest of the corpse.  

Every part of a Flood Dragon-Tiger was valuable—scales, hide, tendons, claws—all could be used to craft mid-grade magical artifacts. Even its blood was a potent tonic, far superior to that so-called "Tiger Bone Seven-Leaf Wine."  

Unfortunately, he had already used the white needle once.  

His magic power was only enough for one more strike—either with the white or black needle—leaving him no energy to dismember the corpse.  

His storage pouch didn't have enough space for the entire Flood Dragon-Tiger.  

And he certainly couldn't just carry the corpse back openly—such recklessness would only invite robbery and murder by nightfall.  

Seeing Wang Chan summon a previously unseen mid-grade white needle—so powerful that it effortlessly retrieved the horn—Madam Cheng's expression darkened, as if realizing why he no longer feared her threats.  

However, noticing his lingering interest in the rest of the Flood Dragon-Tiger's remains, she took a deep breath and said:  

"Two months apart, and Brother Wang's needles have grown so fierce and brutal—how enviable. But this Flood Dragon-Tiger possesses high-tier bloodline and has awakened a high-grade divine ability. Even in death, its defenses rival those of a mid-grade demon beast. Your needles may be sharp, but you won't be able to dismember it quickly."  

Wang Chan watched her silently.  

"This Flood Dragon-Tiger's high-grade divine ability is no joke. If not for the injuries inflicted by Brother Chen and Patrol Officer Tian, it would never have fallen to this Three-Eyed Crimson Hound," Madam Cheng continued. "Right now, Brother Chen and Patrol Officer Tian are on their way. They'll be here soon."  

"Which Brother Chen?" Wang Chan narrowed his eyes.  

---  

"Brother Wang, living at Lotus Mountain, surely you've heard of Brother Chen?" Madam Cheng replied with a faint smile. "If you're willing to use that brutal white needle of yours to help me, I can assist you in dismembering this corpse before Brother Chen arrives. However—"  

"No need!" Wang Chan cut her off decisively.  

He had suspected the Flood Dragon-Tiger's injuries were linked to Brother Chen, and Madam Cheng's words confirmed it.  

Brother Chen could appear at any moment.  

Recalling how Deputy Chief Yu—a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator—had his arm severed in a single strike from Brother Chen, Wang Chan immediately abandoned any lingering greed for the corpse.  

His goal in this risky venture had been to obtain the high-grade demon bone.  

Mission accomplished—why linger?  

If Brother Chen and the beauty-marked woman arrived, escaping would be impossible.  

As for Madam Cheng? He couldn't care less.  

Without another word, Wang Chan turned to flee.  

Seeing his ruthless departure, Madam Cheng panicked. Her eyes flickered before she quickly added:  

"If I'm not mistaken, that horn must contain the high-grade demon bone! No doubt, Brother Chen is coming precisely for it!"  

Wang Chan's steps faltered.  

"I'm a demonic cultivator, and right now, I can't move. If Brother Chen catches me, I'm as good as dead. But before I die, do you really think I'd still honor our Heart Demon Oath?" Madam Cheng said coldly. "Of course, if Brother Wang is confident he can escape Brother Chen's pursuit, then by all means—"  

"Where is the Three-Eyed Crimson Hound's Yin Heel Acupoint?!"  

Wang Chan barked.
