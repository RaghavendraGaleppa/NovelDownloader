# Chapter 112: Response

Liu Xiaosheng walked away leisurely, while Yang Ji frowned.

He hadn't expected that revealing his talent would bring both benefits and drawbacks. Indeed, all things are mutually complementary and restrictive, with ups and downs, pros and cons; everything has two sides, an inescapable law. This Liu Xiaosheng actually took an interest in him and insisted on recruiting him, which was quite troublesome. If he were just a person, it would be easier to handle, but the main issue was that he was a "demon."

This demon wasn't a human who cultivated demonic arts, but a true Outerworld Celestial Demon. Celestial Demons are cunning and skilled in trickery. Earth Demons are ferocious and tyrannical by nature. These two major races often preyed on other races and were the most reviled in the myriad worlds. Once discovered, they would be hunted down and killed like rats scurrying across the street.

Celestial Demons, in particular, were a great scourge to cultivators, full of stratagems, directly targeting the weaknesses of the human heart, capable of inducing heart demons and causing cultivators to die tragically. Many people hated them to the bone yet were deeply wary of them. Due to the Celestial Demons' ability to induce heart demons, the Ten Great Daoist Sects and the Ten Great Demonic Sects had even opened Celestial Demon Hunting Grounds, directly connected to the outer void. Disciples would enter to train, confront Celestial Demons, temper their character, cultivating a radiant mind, enlightened thoughts, pure and free from delusion. Through the tempering of Celestial Demons, their minds would transform, achieving the grand state of 'Great Freedom from Delusion,' where worldly affairs cause no disturbance and the immortal path no worry. This state was like that of eminent Buddhist monks meditating, their sarira radiating Buddha light, impervious to evil.

Of course, achieving true freedom in controlling the seven emotions and six desires, and remaining unaffected by anger, delusion, greed, etc., was extremely difficult. Even Immortal Kings couldn't fully achieve it; if they could suppress heart demons, it was only because they hadn't encountered a powerful opponent capable of inducing their heart demons. To be saddled with a Celestial Demon, and a Demon Emperor at that, made Yang Ji's head ache. This was equivalent to a Mahayana stage existence.

He sat down and pondered for a moment, knowing that with his own strength, it would be impossible to erase the karmic entanglement completely. If possible, he didn't want to meet this Celestial Demon, but their previous conversation had already created karma between them. That demon's expression brooked no refusal; it truly intended to claim him. If he refused, he didn't know what disaster might befall him, especially since this was a cunning Celestial Demon.

After some thought, Yang Ji decided to shift the problem, letting the sect deal with that demon. If the sect listened to him, that would be for the best; if not, he'd be out of options.

"Honored Master, do you really plan to tell the sect that this kid is a Celestial Demon? He's a true disciple, of noble status. If the sect doesn't believe you and accuses you of slandering him, and if this kid finds out, it could be big trouble. Perhaps, *snap*, he'll kill you to silence you." The Buddha-Child, as expected of one who had absorbed countless cultivators' soul fragments and cultivated the Supreme Buddha-Demon Scripture, became increasingly insightful, instantly considering all the pros and cons.

How could Yang Ji not know? But if he didn't take any action, he could only be forced to join the Reincarnation Heaven Domain and serve under someone else. This was not what he wanted to see.

"Of course, we can't approach those Void Refinement or Body Integration stage elders. We must find the true high-level figures. Such individuals possess clear insight, discerning the smallest details, knowing the stakes, and won't act rashly. Even if I say that Liu Xiaosheng is a Celestial Demon, such figures wouldn't act like minor characters, tattling on a true disciple. On the contrary, they might secretly take it seriously, and if Liu Xiaosheng is indeed found to be a Celestial Demon, then I'll be free." Yang Ji's thoughts spun a thousand times in an instant, considering all possibilities.

"Then who should we seek?" The Buddha-Child asked, frowning.

"Elder Chunye?!" Suddenly, both the man and the orphan spoke at the same time.

"Elder Chunye guards the Dao Pagoda and is in charge of all the sect's cultivation methods and divine abilities. He is absolutely the core of the core of the sect; otherwise, he wouldn't be in this position. Moreover, Elder Chunye is approachable, the only high-level figure I can access."

"It must be him, and only him," Yang Ji affirmed, his eyes gleaming.

"Alright, Honored Master, to avoid bowing to that demon, let's go find Elder Chunye. That son of a bitch! He actually wants Honored Master to kneel and serve him as master? Where does that leave me, your Buddha-Child? Dream on!" The Buddha-Child grumbled indignantly.

Yang Ji didn't go directly to the Dao Pagoda; instead, he first went to the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance, bought a good pot of Monkey Wine, and only then hurried over.

At this moment, outside the Dao Pagoda. Under the pretext of claiming a divine ability, Yang Ji obtained permission from two gate-keeping disciples and entered. Elder Chunye, as usual, was still drinking alone.

"Oh, young Yang, what wind blew you here again? Come quickly and have a couple of drinks with me." Seeing Yang Ji approach, Elder Chunye turned his head, his messy hair swaying. A smile immediately appeared on his handsome face, full of the vicissitudes of middle age yet uniquely charming, as he gestured for Yang Ji to come and sit. Yang Ji had drunk with Elder Chunye once before when he came to collect the "Golden Light Traversing the Earth" divine ability. Over time, they had grown somewhat familiar with each other.

"Elder, today I saw a pot of excellent three-thousand-year Monkey Wine at the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance. I know you're fond of this, so I specially brought it to show my respects," Yang Ji said respectfully with a smile.

"Oh? Three-thousand-year Monkey Wine? Sit, sit quickly." Chunye's eyes lit up, and he repeatedly gestured with his hand.

"Come, Elder, I'll pour you some." Yang Ji pulled out the stopper. A rich, mellow, fragrant aroma unique to spiritual peaches immediately diffused, the wine a pale yellow, like liquid jade or golden elixir, thick and fragrant.

"Good, good, this is excellent Monkey Wine. How did you get it? When I went to the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance before, they only sold me two-thousand-year-old wine. Young Yang, you've got your ways," Chunye said, raising his cup to smell the aroma, praising Yang Ji.

Yang Ji didn't know about this; he had merely told Bai Bi'er that he needed a fine pot of wine, the more precious, the better. He hadn't expected that even Elder Chunye couldn't buy this three-thousand-year Monkey Wine. It seemed Bai Bi'er was truly reliable.

"Come, pour yourself some too. Let's have a drink," Chunye said, smiling and raising his cup. Yang Ji also filled his cup and smiled as he drained it with Elder Chunye. With one cup down, a delightful fragrance filled their stomachs.

The two savored the taste with narrowed eyes for a moment. Only then did Elder Chunye look at Yang Ji with a half-smile: "Speak, young Yang, do you have something to tell me today?"

Yang Ji chuckled, "Elder, your insight is sharp as a torch; nothing can be hidden from you."

"Offering courtesies for no reason? How could I not know?" Elder Chunye smiled, raising an eyebrow. "Speak."

"Elder, I'm really going to say it," Yang Ji said, steadying himself.

"Don't be hesitant, just say it," Elder Chunye said, putting down his cup.

"Elder, the true disciple Liu Xiaosheng is a Celestial Demon. Although he has a human body and human soul, his consciousness and memories since childhood are not human; they are the reincarnated consciousness of a Demon Emperor. Such methods are extraordinary. He has no demonic qi, yet he possesses the heart of a Demon Emperor. For such a demon to join our Boundless Dao Sect, I don't know what his intentions are." Yang Ji transmitted his voice, his tone serious.

"Hmm?" A bright light suddenly flashed in Chunye's eyes, and he abruptly looked up. Yang Ji had imagined countless reactions from him, but he had not anticipated his next words.

"How do you know he's a Celestial Demon? Have you told anyone else? Don't you dare ruin the sect's plan, young man," Chunye said, his voice solemn and his face serious.

"Ah? The sect knows?" Yang Ji was stunned.
