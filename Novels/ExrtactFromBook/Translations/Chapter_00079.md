# Chapter 79: The Master-Disciple Pact  

Li Changle's true disciple cave abode was located on the northern side of Feilai Peak.  

Though it had been uninhabited for centuries, it remained exactly as he had left it.  

Following the trail of magical energy, Han Yue arrived at Li Changle's cave, only to find his master already seated in the courtyard, waiting for him.  

After more than half a year of recuperation, Li Changle had fully restored his cultivation and was in excellent condition.  

Gone was the sharp, intense demeanor he had when first freed from imprisonment. Now, his aura was as gentle and refined as jade—the very image of an enlightened master.  

Han Yue, seeing his master so transformed, was delighted for him.  

Li Changle spoke first:  
"Yuanchu, it's been half a year since you arrived. Have you adjusted to life in the Shenxiao Palace?"  

Without hesitation, Han Yue replied:  
"Disciple feels extremely well!"  
"The profound teachings of our sect have already allowed me to make great progress in just half a year!"  
"All the elders and fellow disciples have been very kind and welcoming."  

Li Changle nodded and continued:  
"Now that you've mastered the *Minor Thunderclap Art*, you may consult the *Ancestral Transmission* for any cultivation questions. This has been the way of our Shenxiao Palace disciples for ten thousand years."  
"Our sect has always been small in number within the *Jade Firmament Realm*, and there is little competition among disciples. The atmosphere is harmonious."  
"If you encounter any difficulties, don't hesitate to seek help from your peers. Do not worry about disturbing their cultivation."  

Han Yue acknowledged his master's words and took the opportunity to ask a question of his own:  
"Master, I often hear that the top sects of the *Jade Firmament Realm* are tasked with safeguarding their continents and protecting the people."  
"Yet our Shenxiao Palace has few disciples and is the sole supreme power in Reed Continent. How do we manage to defend the entire territory?"  
"Wouldn’t other cultivation forces in Reed Continent harbor ambitions or act against our sect’s rules?"  

Li Changle chuckled.  
"Yuanchu, you see the surface but not the root."  
"The five inner continents of the *Jade Firmament Realm* are vast and separated by immense distances. Each faces its own calamities, and their geographies and cultures differ drastically!"  
"You hail from Osmanthus Continent, so you know that despite its rampant demonic disasters and powerful monsters, its environment is bountiful—food and water are plentiful."  
"In terms of population, Osmanthus ranks among the top two, rivaling Central Continent, with a populace a thousand times that of Reed Continent!"  
"Naturally, the number of cultivators there flourishes, creating fierce competition and a thriving atmosphere."  
"But Reed Continent is entirely different."  

"Reed Continent is plagued by natural disasters far more terrifying than those of other lands!"  
"When you next venture out, you will witness this firsthand."  
"Ninety percent of Reed Continent is besieged by relentless calamities—so harsh that not only humans but even demonic beasts struggle to survive."  
"Only along the banks of the Heavenly River are there signs of life. Thus, Reed Continent has the smallest population, not even matching a single large county of Central Continent!"  
"In such an environment, the greatest enemy of both man and beast is nature itself."  
"You will find a culture unlike any other—one that values unity, cooperation, and the belief that human will can conquer heaven. Every resource, every life, is fiercely protected."  
"Even the demonic beasts here ally with humans for survival."  
"Because of this unique landscape, Reed Continent has no other sects besides Shenxiao Palace."  
"Only a few clans and powerful beasts have formed fortified settlements, struggling to survive together."  
"Thus, internal conflicts requiring our intervention are rare. Most battles are fought against nature."  
"Yet despite this, under the pressure of calamities, Reed Continent imposes no barriers to cultivation. Though our population is small, we boast the highest proportion of cultivators among all continents—each one resolute in Dao-heart and skilled in combat!"  
"Moreover, Shenxiao Palace’s teachings are systematic and profound. We focus on nurturing elites, producing mighty experts. Though few in number, every disciple here rivals the true inheritors of any great sect!"  

Li Changle’s detailed explanation gave Han Yue a swift understanding of Reed Continent’s circumstances.  

Having yet to read the sect’s foundational texts, Han Yue had known little about the continents. Now, he realized the *Jade Firmament Realm* was not only vast but also incredibly diverse in its regional conditions.  

Li Changle continued:  
"Yuanchu, broadening your horizons is vital to cultivation. Once you’ve stabilized your foundation in a few years, you should journey beyond the mountains. Seclusion alone won’t forge a top-tier Golden Core—experiencing Reed Continent’s perilous landscapes will temper your spirit."  

"Understood, Master!" Han Yue wholeheartedly agreed.  

"I summoned you today because your grandmaster Shangxi and I have decided that I will enter seclusion for three years. Upon emerging, I will assume leadership of Shenxiao Palace."  
"Before I withdraw, there are matters I must settle with you."  
"In the *Body Entry* stage, the greatest pitfall is greed—becoming enamored with our sect’s powerful divine abilities and secret arts while neglecting core cultivation."  
"That’s why Shenxiao Palace grants each new disciple only three divine arts."  
"I know you’ve already made progress in cultivation, but do not grow overconfident!"  
"I set a three-year deadline for you. Within this time, master the foundational teachings."  
"Once I emerge, you must devote yourself entirely to refining your essence."  
"As the only one who understands the profundity of your *Nectar* ability, I will use my sect contributions to exchange for a Golden Core-stage refinement art—one that will greatly accelerate your progress!"  

"Thank you, Master!" Han Yue bowed deeply.  

"Go now and cultivate diligently." With that, Li Changle dismissed Han Yue and prepared for his three-year seclusion.  

When he emerged, the three centuries of suppression would be transformed into nourishment, propelling him to the peak of the third rank—just one step from the realm of Longevity.  

As Han Yue flew back to his cave, he pondered his path forward while listening to his fellow disciples’ discussions.  

The current topic was swordsman Miaosheng’s recounting of a battle against a colossal starfish, arguing that sword techniques were far superior to talismans when facing regenerating foes.  

Of course, this was no ordinary starfish—it was a prince under the command of *Golden Ao*, the Eternal Sea King of the Eastern Ocean.  

Yet not everyone agreed. Miaoyun, a talisman specialist, insisted that her divine talismans could effortlessly annihilate such creatures!
