# Chapter 212: Journey to Líluan Mountain

At dawn, a gentle breeze swept through as the Ministry of Internal Affairs took control of the northern ruins. Teams of law-enforcing cultivators from the Moonview City Alliance cordoned off the area, processing the remaining assets and corpses. All findings would eventually be submitted to the Ministry for official records, assessing losses and compensation to restore public trust.

However, following last night's battle, over ten thousand transient cultivators had already left Moonview City by morning. It was foreseeable that more would continue to depart in the coming days. Capital naturally seeks safety—cultivators, being human, also yearn for peaceful environments to practice their arts.

Those who remained were mostly long-term residents with deep roots in the city—relatives, social networks, businesses, and memories tied them to this place, making departure difficult.

As for Patriarch Yang and his allies, despite cooperation from local clans, their exhaustive search yielded no trace of the real Bear Mountain Master. It seemed the man had vanished amid last night's chaos. Left with no choice, they departed to seek elsewhere.

Thus, the whereabouts of Bear Mountain Master became an unsolved mystery. Of course, if anyone in the city knew, it would undoubtedly be Lin Shan. Having witnessed the terrifying power of that purple tentacle and the fall of the legendary Melting Gold Patriarch, Lin Shan was both awed and wary.

With the Black Skeleton Demon Lord soon to recover to Golden Core stage and their impending journey to the Dai Family for breakthrough resources, Lin Shan saw no need to pursue Bear Mountain Master's trail. Let the higher powers deal with that purple tentacle's eventual resurgence—such concerns were beyond a minor player like him.

The mention of eldritch beings reminded Lin Shan of his encounter during his Qi Refining days in Bianliang, capital of the Great Song, when he cursed the heir of Prince Qi's household. A monstrous eyeball had appeared then, later rumored to be in possession of the Violet Sky Sect. After the demonic calamity, all news of it vanished—its current status unknown.

Shaking off these thoughts, Lin Shan discussed recovery plans with the Black Skeleton Demon Lord for the coming three months. The demon explained that as an infernal being, skeletal clans had multiple advancement paths. Ordinary skeletons like itself had even more varied options—its original form had used magma tempering, a hellish bone-refining technique equivalent to this world's "Flawless Body" forging method before Golden Core breakthrough.

For liquefied essence refinement and flawless Golden Core formation, their counterparts were "marrow soul-forging" and "Hundred-Aperture Soul Core" condensation. Unlike humans, skeletal clans formed their soul cores within the skull, similar to how demons formed demon cores or ghosts formed spectral cores. Additional transformations like "bone proliferation," "joint metamorphosis," "jade marrow bones," or "crystal inlays" depended on individual cultivation methods and lineage.

To swiftly recover to Golden Core stage, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord needed to enter an active volcano's magma chamber. After scanning maps, they chose Líluan Mountain in Pengpi County, northwestern Lu State—a remote, sparsely populated area ideal for secluded cultivation.

Lin Shan instructed Lü Xiuming to lead their forces to join the alliance against the Dai Family in three months, temporarily handing over Lin Trading Company's operations. As for the previously arranged buyer, Merchant Wu, the failed fish farm venture and Moonview City's post-battle economic downturn led to his breach of contract, though he compensated Lin Shan with spirit stones.

Though regrettable, Lin Shan wasn't overly concerned. Once the Black Skeleton Demon Lord regained Golden Core strength, he planned to establish his own faction using his long-time followers as core members. He also considered recalling his subordinates from the Eastern Sea when possible.

A thousand miles east of Moonview City, a group hurried along on a pangolin spirit beast ridden by Dai Budong. The Dai clansmen slumped despondently—the loss of Melting Gold Patriarch had shattered their morale. Their original mission to investigate and capture the culprit was now impossible without Golden Core support. Moreover, last night's anti-Dai upsurge made remaining in Moonview City perilous.

With their Golden Core protector gone and public outrage mounting—led by the Yang Family and eight other Golden Core cultivators—the Dai contingent fled overnight, abandoning even Bear Mountain Master in their dungeon. The mysterious purple tentacle that could combat late Golden Core experts and poison Melting Gold Patriarch suggested origins beyond their comprehension—perhaps a protective measure left by the Nascent Soul master Pure Lotus Hermit.

Facing catastrophic consequences upon returning home—two Golden Core elders dead, business assets lost, and their target escaped—Dai Budong's group shuddered at the unimaginable retribution awaiting them.

"This is utterly unjust!" Dai Budong cursed, burdened by undeserved blame.

His clansmen looked expectantly to Zhu Duiyou for solutions. After a dramatic performance of reluctance and feigned suicide attempts with a mundane sword (easily thwarted by his followers), Dai Budong "reluctantly" agreed to their collective urging to defect rather than face certain death back home.

Thus, the group vanished into obscurity, never to be seen again in Lu State's cultivation world.

At Líluan Mountain in Pengpi County—a 2,000-zhang active volcano surrounded by a vast lake—the Black Skeleton Demon Lord inhaled the sulfurous fumes with relish before plunging into the molten depths. Lin Shan, hovering nearby on his Descending Cloud Banner, settled in to await its Golden Core transformation, unaware of what changes would emerge from this secluded cultivation.
