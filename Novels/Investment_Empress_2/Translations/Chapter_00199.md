# Chapter 199: A Surge in Fortune and the Reward: The Scripture of the Golden Elixir Divine Pill

The bright moon hung high in the sky.

The owner of this room was clearly someone who understood aesthetics, as every piece of furniture and decoration showed careful consideration.

However, the owner would never have imagined that the room would one day be personally cleaned by the Empress of the Phoenix (from her past life).

At this moment, Ying Bing was holding a broom, sweeping the house clean.

Even the pair of walnuts on the table, which had been polished over many years to develop a rich patina, were wiped spotless by her using a cloth and circulating her True Qi.

"This feeling is..."

"Acting according to the heart, and thoughts flowing unobstructed?"

Sensing the flow of inscriptions on the small figure within her Dantian, the second acupoint gradually filling up, Ying Bing gently put down the broom and cloth and opened the window.

The breeze was gentle, and the moon was bright. The small courtyard was quiet and still.

She gazed at the Taiyin star, her eyes reflecting it like a secluded spring under the moonlight.

Observing the divine is for tempering the spirit and honing the will, yet the strength of one's state of mind is the root of the spirit.

Now, she could remain calm and composed in the face of all things.

She was just about to begin her training when the system's notification sounded:

* Ding! *

* Time until the next ranking comparison: 8 days. *

"Eight days..."

Ying Bing's eyelashes lowered.

Going with the flow was one thing, but wanting to top the rankings was also a deep-seated desire in her heart.

However, no matter what the final result was, she could now face it with equanimity.

* Reminder! *

* The next punishment will be: Requesting the winner to touch you (covering at least 80% of your body). *

The corner of Ying Bing's eye twitched.

...

In another room.

Li Mo was tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep. As he recalled Ice Cube's behavior today, he found it filled with two words:

"Abnormal!"

Or three words:

"Something's not right!"

Since when did Ice Cube care about others?

She even actively requested dual cultivation?

Even a sudden change in personality wouldn't explain this...

Could it be... palliative care?!

Is something about to happen to me?

After thinking for a long time without finding an answer, Li Mo decided to draw his rewards to calm himself down.

To be safe, he first opened his status information.

**Name:** Li Mo
**Age:** 16
**Physique:** Profound牝 Divine Body
**Cultivation Realm:** One Acupoint of Observing the Divine (on the verge of a breakthrough)
**Destiny:** ???
**Evaluation:** Carries a Divine Body, destiny is chaotic, future is unpredictable.
**Recent Events:** At Hengyun Sword City, comprehended the 'Spiritual Stone of the Immortals,'领悟了一门完整的神功锤法, and obtained the title of Sword Immortal of Yunzhou ("I call you Sword Immortal, do you dare to answer?").*

"..."

Ignoring the system's inexplicable attempt at humor, Li Mo let out a soft sigh.

Unfortunately, he still couldn't see his own destiny.

The "Recent Events" section also didn't mention anything that was about to happen.

* You have multiple pending investment rewards. Would you like to claim them? *

"Claim."

Li Mo said softly in his heart.

* Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in Dong Chang'an, allowing him to avoid disaster during the attack by the Fine Rain Tower. *
* Investment Reward: 3,000 taels of gold. *

* Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in Lu Mo, allowing him to avoid disaster during the attack by the Fine Rain Tower. *
* Investment Reward: Three-Turn Supporting Origin Grass. *

...

A long string of rewards followed one after another.

This batch of rewards was much longer and more dazzling than the last.

---

After all, the last time was about guiding many people, while this time was about saving the lives and fortunes of many people.

Therefore, as long as the destiny wasn't white, the rewards were all quite good.

Li Mo sorted the rewards as usual.

Sigh.

Counting gold and piling it into a mountain was such a boring process.

And those strange treasures, genius earthly treasures, how could there be so many? Some he didn't even recognize, and he couldn't even finish reading the introductions.

Roughly calculating, the value of the Baohuan Tower was only about one one-hundred-and-fiftieth of Li.

Moreover!

"The most fragrant one, Ice Cube's reward, hasn't been opened yet!"

Little Li looked at the unclaimed rewards and couldn't help but ponder.

Could Ice Cube's abnormal behavior be related to this investment reward he was about to claim?

They had only dual cultivated...

It was understandable to get a reward for dual cultivation, but reaching enlightenment while cultivating was truly baffling.

"Claim."

Li Mo shook his head and first claimed the reward.

* Investment Reward: The Scripture of the Golden Elixir Divine Pill *

* [The Scripture of the Golden Elixir Divine Pill]: "Not limited to external elixirs and gold-making arts, also involves Qigong and Shouyi. It is mysterious and profound, containing the ultimate principles, and is the fundamental method for refining external elixirs." *

"Elixir Refining?"

Li Mo thought from the name that it would be similar to the *Scripture of the Zodiacal Stellar Primordial Elixir*...

No.

It couldn't be said to be purely elixir refining; it just included that part.

Besides refining external elixirs, it also included methods to control them.

"One Primordial Elixir Scripture, one Divine Elixir Scripture."

"Could these two produce some kind of synergy..."

Li Mo thought of the divine skill he had just obtained today.

*The Human道 Killing Hammer of Heaven and Earth Overturning* had three forms.

The requirement for the first form was to have at least seven Primordial Elixirs in one's body, forming the Big Dipper, to be able to summon the power of a falling star.

Including his Sword Pill, he was still short of four Primordial Elixirs.

If he relied on himself to cultivate, who knew how long it would take.

This was also the drawback of the *Scripture of the Zodiacal Stellar Primordial Elixir*; it required a long accumulation of time.

"What if I refined external elixirs?"

Little Li started thinking hard.

He remembered that Elder Xue had a similar attempt, and although this attempt suffered some setbacks, it...

Ultimately succeeded on him and Junior Brother Xiao Bao.

Was there a possibility that the problem... lay with the elixirs?

If he used the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir Divine Pill* to refine elixirs, could they be similar to Junior Brother Xiao Bao, successfully replicating Elder Xue's theory?

Li Mo's thoughts wandered, and he thought of many things for a moment.

However, in the end, he still shook his head slightly.

"It's a pity Elder Xue isn't in Yunzhou."

"Otherwise, I could ask him..."

The feeling of having a divine skill but being unable to use it was uncomfortable.

Li Mo hoped to turn it into his own as soon as possible, making it one of his ultimate trump cards.

After studying it a bit, he found that his martial arts insights were truly exhausted.

This external elixir术 was also directly imprinted in his mind.

After contemplating it for a while, he felt his head grow heavy, and the burden on his spirit was immense.

"It's almost midnight."

Li Mo looked at the moon high in the sky outside the window.

He walked out of his room and arrived at Ice Cube's door.

Looking at the closed door, he was just about to knock.

* Pa— *

The door opened.

Their eyes met.

PS: Typos will be corrected later.
I saw the guest appearances from the audience, I'll pick a few to arrange later, but I can't guarantee the roles will be very decent...
I'm moving tomorrow, so I need to get up early to write, mwah.
