# Chapter 63: The Grim Palace

Moonlight filtered through the gaps between the eaves, shattered into fragments by the countless figures hiding on the ridges, beams, and rooftops.

Xu Yunfan lay prone on the rear side of the roof, his earlobes twitching slightly with the rhythmic breathing sounds rising and falling in the distance.

The place was practically packed.

It was utterly ridiculous!

He knew perfectly well that with such a large group of people flooding into the Thousand Buddha Temple, even if the rumors were baseless, there were bound to be some unscrupulous characters among them.

Or rather, there were definitely unscrupulous characters.

However...

Xu Yunfan changed his mind. He felt he couldn't leave. If he missed this opportunity, once the Thousand Buddha Temple was on guard, the only way to sneak in again would be to fight his way in.

Suddenly, he turned his head to look at another side of the eaves, where Su Shiyu was feeling her way along the roof tiles.

"Brother, aren't you going down?"

Su Shiyu, her face covered, spoke in a deliberately rough voice, cupping her hands in a mock salute.

This girl hadn't even grasped the窍门 of moving her Qi and blood yet; she hadn't even entered the path of martial arts, yet she dared to wade into these muddy waters among a crowd of bandits.

The deliberately lowered voice drifted over, carrying the scent of osmanthus rouge. Xu Yunfan squinted at the silver-threaded cloud patterns embroidered on her face veil.

She was, after all, the young lady of the Su family; even her night clothes were tailored from Zhongzhou's cloud brocade, standing in stark contrast to the coarse linen and hemp worn by most of those around.

Xu Yunfan was inwardly speechless, his face cold as he said, "Third-rate skills, not even having entered the path of martial arts, and you dare come here to join the fun? Looking for death?"

Su Shiyu was choked into taking a step back, the筒瓦 (roof tiles) crunching under her boots.

Suddenly, a graceful black figure flashed out from the side. The figure clad in a tight-fitting night suit outlined a heart-stopping curve under the moonlight.

"There's no need for you to worry, Sir. Let's go."

The woman's voice sounded like it was dipped in an icy spring. As she pulled Su Shiyu down from the eaves, the rhythm of her swaying waist seemed to unconsciously match the rhythm of a snake shedding its skin.

Hearing this, Su Shiyu was pulled along by the woman but turned her head to glance at Xu Yunfan, particularly at the long staff on his back. She hesitated for a moment before quickly following the black-clad woman down the eaves.

Although she felt something was familiar, knowing Xu Yunfan's temperament, he probably wouldn't join in such a lively affair.

Su Shiyu abandoned the thought of calling out.

Watching Su Shiyu move away, disappearing around a corner with the black-clad woman, Xu Yunfan shook his head slightly and thought no more of it.

"Who goes there?!"

A thunderous roar suddenly erupted from the distance, unmistakably from the temple's martial monks reacting.

Eighteen torches shot up like red snakes. The dull thud of the martial monks' copper rods striking the ground startled the entire temple's vermin.

With so many people, it would be strange if they weren't discovered.

Perfect opportunity!

Xu Yunfan's foot arches suddenly tensed. His two hundred and thirty pound body shot towards the rear courtyard of the Thousand Buddha Temple like an arrow released from a bow.

The explosive force from his shin bones could easily shatter the筒瓦 into spiderweb-like cracks, yet as he touched the tiles, he used the ball of his foot as a pivot to spin and dissipate the force. The entire movement was like a giant python rolling over, not even disturbing the copper bells at the eaves.

Moving with the speed of a rabbit and the agility of a falcon, Xu Yunfan crossed over the roofs and climbed to the peaks, landing without a sound, causing no disturbance whatsoever.

At the instant of each landing, Xu Yunfan would cover the surface with the sole of his foot, then his body would crouch like a great cat, increasing the contact area with the roof to disperse the sound and minimize noise.

Combining the wall-climbing and roof-walking from the Flying Legs technique, the agile leaps of the Spirit Ape, and the silent landing effect from his hunting skills, his movement technique had reached an astonishing level.

Especially for traversing eaves like this, his weight of over two hundred pounds felt like nothing.

This body, tempered to perfection, stretched out in the dark night. The tremor of every muscle transformed into precise force, perfectly distributing the weight of the long staff on his back between his ten fingers and his foot arches.

He glanced back at the chaos. As the temple's candles were lit, illuminating the place brightly, those who had sneaked into the temple, if they lacked sufficient light body movement skills, would most likely be beaten out by the temple's martial monks.

Climbing over the high wall, he mounted a roof and lay low, watching as several hundred martial monks, holding熟铜棍 (cast copper rods), quickly rushed towards the front courtyard, led by over a dozen martial instructors.

They moved with the stride of dragons and tigers, their sleeves fluttering, their speed extremely fast.

For a time, the rear courtyard became much quieter, leaving only the monks holding lanterns, patrolling methodically.

Listening to the shouts and roars that occasionally echoed through the entire Thousand Buddha Temple from the front courtyard, and the increasingly clamorous sounds of weapons clashing, Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. He glanced at a team of monks passing below, their faces slightly tinged with worry.

He seized the opportunity. His figure was like a wild goose; in mid-air, he executed a sparrow hawk flip and landed on a row of houses, beginning to search slowly.

When Xu Yunfan had dodged the lanterns of the patrolling martial monks for the fifth time, he arrived at a corner of the temple grounds built against the mountain. He looked at the Buddhist hall before him, constructed as if embedded into the mountain body, surrounded by high walls, with only a corner of the flying eaves visible.

A flicker of strangeness passed through Xu Yunfan's eyes. He was certain that this place was most likely what he was looking for.

Following the scent, he climbed over the final courtyard wall and passed through seven layers of glazed treasure roofs.

Suddenly, a thick, strange fragrance flooded his nasal cavity. Xu Yunfan's nostrils flared, and a rusty, sweet taste rose in his throat.

This scent was like a hundred kinds of spices calcined in a bronze furnace for a hundred years, mixed with the sweet, fishy smell of some animal fat.

This was no ordinary incense; it seemed to be the burning of faith from millions of worshippers.

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan's muscles tensed violently, and his pupils contracted slightly.

Cold sweat seeped from the hand gripping the dripping eaves. The hall before him seemed like a living creature, breathing in and out a mist from an unknown source.

The relief carvings of eight gnarled arms on the vermilion lintel of the Buddhist hall seemed to sway with his gaze, constantly changing their gestures.

It turned out to be a problem with the carving technique.

It took a good while for Xu Yunfan to relax his muscles slightly. He looked up and saw that the roof tile he was holding had been indented three inches by his finger strength.

Xu Yunfan remained silent, feeling that something was wrong in his heart. He immediately had the thought of retreating.

This place was too诡异 (strange/uncanny); it was best to leave first.

Thinking this in an instant, Xu Yunfan hooked his hand and flipped back onto the roof. He took a step, intending to cross the high wall, when he felt the scene before him blur slightly.

By the time he reacted, he had already landed in front of the Buddhist hall's gate.

The moment the bronze lock on the large door turned to dust before his eyes, a chilling sandalwood mist surged out from the hall.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. Behind the wide-open hall, what greeted his eyes were three-headed Bodhisattva statues on the offering platform slowly turning amidst the incense smoke.

The central head gazed down with compassion, the left one glared with fangs, while the right one had nothing but a dark, empty eye socket. Below, the eight arms formed various mudras, as if they were about to step down from the offering table at any moment.

The gilded patterns on the offering table oozed dark red, clearly the result of dried blood soaking through a century's worth of scriptures.

The sides of the Buddhist hall were lined with various statues of Arhats and Bodhisattvas. However, in this诡异 environment, their originally dignified and benevolent appearances had turned sinister and eerie, looking at people with venomous eyes.

*'You are affected by an ominous aura; illusions seem to appear before your eyes.'*

Xu Yunfan's expression changed. Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately formed the Seal of Lin (Lin Yin), silently reciting the Heart Mantra of the Highest Good is Like Water in his mind.
