# Chapter 48: Five Senses Connection  

The importance that the Scripture Valley placed on this news didn't surprise Jiang Li.  

If Yu Banxia and the others were still stuck on the first layer—seeing only the immediate profit of a few thousand spirit stones from the children involved—then the sect stood at a higher vantage point, focusing on the phenomenon itself and the greater benefits it could bring.  

As for Jiang Li? He was probably already on the third layer.  
(◡‿◡)  

"Young Jiang Li, you've done well. This time, you've stumbled upon a great opportunity."  

"As long as nothing goes wrong, the sect won’t treat you unfairly. You could even become an inner disciple directly."  

Jiang Li handed the communication spirit stone back, and Elder Weng Sanqi seemed to be in an excellent mood.  

As expected, the lion's share of the credit would naturally go to the elder. Such was the way of the world, where status and position dictated rewards.  

As for the "nothing goes wrong" part, it naturally referred to...  

"Elder, rest assured. Every word I’ve said is true, without the slightest falsehood. There will be no mishaps."  

Jiang Li knew exactly what the elder was worried about—the authenticity of the information. He had verified it repeatedly and was certain there were no issues.  

"Good, confidence is good."  

"What’s with that strange expression? If you have something to say, speak up."  

Having benefited from the situation, Elder Weng Sanqi was far more talkative than before. Noticing Jiang Li’s hesitant expression, he urged him to speak.  

"It's like this, Elder Weng. Besides entering the inner sect, are there any other options I could choose from?"  

The reward hadn’t even been finalized yet, and Jiang Li was already thinking about how to spend it.  

"Oh? What’s wrong? The benefits of being an inner disciple are considerable. That’s not enough for you?"  

Elder Weng’s ruddy face showed confusion and a hint of displeasure. For most outer disciples, entering the inner sect was a lifelong dream.  

Especially since Jiang Li only had a mid-grade spiritual root, the elder wondered if he was being greedy for more.  

"Elder, the Outer Sect Grand Competition is coming up soon. I’d like to earn my way into the inner sect through my own abilities."  

Jiang Li didn’t outright say that the outer sect disciples were trash and he didn’t want to waste his reward opportunity. Instead, he framed it as wanting to rely on his own efforts.  

Though the meaning was the same, one phrasing made him sound like a schemer, while the other made him seem admirably determined.  

His answer took the elder by surprise, and the elder’s expression softened.  

These higher-ups were always like this—firmly convinced of their own beliefs and quick to judge others based on their own values.  

Even a simple suggestion being rejected could provoke their displeasure. Until Jiang Li’s status matched or surpassed theirs, he had to tread carefully and stroke their egos.  

"Oh? You’re that confident about winning the Outer Sect Grand Competition?"  

"Wait—did you have a conflict with that disciple from the Shu Mountain Five Elements Peak before?"  

Elder Weng hadn’t paid much attention earlier, but now he recalled Yin Qiu’s strange behavior and parting words.  

The sword cultivators of Shu Mountain’s Five Elements Peak were notoriously formidable. Yet, Yin Qiu had actually invited Jiang Li to a rematch—proof that Jiang Li must have something special about him.  

"There was a minor disagreement with Senior Brother Yin Qiu at first, but this disciple didn’t disgrace the Scripture Valley."  

Jiang Li modestly cupped his hands, but his meaning was clear: he hadn’t lost.  

"You didn’t lose against a Five Elements Peak disciple?"  

Elder Weng’s shock mirrored Yin Qiu’s earlier expression. As expected, outer disciples were inherently looked down upon.  

With poor talent, scarce resources, and low status, they were at the very bottom of the hierarchy.  

"Truly unexpected. The disciples of the Five Elements Peak are no ordinary opponents. For you to have such skill after just a few months in the sect, no wonder you’re confident."  

"If that’s the case, I do have a suggestion for you..."  

After hearing the elder’s words, Jiang Li’s eyes lit up, and he fell into thought.  

"Elder Weng, this disciple has one more request."  

Unused favors expired, depreciated, or even became void.  

Jiang Li understood this principle well, especially when dealing with someone like Elder Weng, who drank daily and had a poor memory.  

Setting aside pride, he cupped his hands and spoke again.  

"Speak. As an elder, I should reward you in advance."  

This was the price for Jiang Li handing the credit over to the elder.  

"This disciple wishes to learn the technique you used to see and hear through your puppets."  

He truly had no other choice. The *Parasitic Puppet Corpse Technique* allowed him to control zombies but didn’t grant shared senses.  

When the black zombie was nearby, it wasn’t an issue. But now, after being ashore for half a day, the zombie seemed to be stuck somewhere. No matter how he manipulated it, it wouldn’t move.  

The *Parasitic Puppet Corpse Technique* had a glaring flaw in this regard. If he could fix it, he should—at the very least, he needed to retrieve that black zombie.  

"You want to learn the *Five Senses Connection Technique*?"  

Elder Weng Sanqi looked surprised.  

"The *Five Senses Connection Technique* is an esoteric art. It’s not hard to learn, but without puppet techniques, it won’t be very effective."  

"Young man, spreading yourself too thin isn’t wise. Are you sure you want to learn this?"  

He glanced at the alchemy apprentice token hanging from Jiang Li’s torn robes.  

"Alchemy alone could occupy a cultivator’s entire lifetime. And now you want to study puppetry too?"  

"Elder, I have other uses for the *Five Senses Connection Technique*. Please teach me."  

Jiang Li inwardly sighed at the elder’s overactive imagination but reassured him.  

"Fine. Here’s the jade slip for the *Five Senses Connection Technique*. Come to me if you have any questions."  

The elder pulled out a jade slip from somewhere and casually handed it to Jiang Li.  

Jiang Li immediately asked several complex questions before retreating to a nearby hut to begin practicing.  

Esoteric arts weren’t bound by the five elements or yin and yang. They were mystical techniques that allowed cultivators to pierce the secrets of the world through wisdom, encompassing incantations, seals, talismans, and rituals.  

As Elder Weng had said, the *Five Senses Connection Technique* wasn’t particularly difficult to learn—at least, the basics weren’t.  

However, mastering it to the elder’s level—where he could simultaneously connect with dozens of puppets for an entire day—was another matter entirely.  

The *Five Senses Connection Technique* consisted of two parts: the method and the seal.  

Typically, a cultivator first had to imprint a seal onto a puppet or another object with sensory orifices, creating a channel and node for their spirit to pass through.  

Then, using the method, they could link their own senses to the object, achieving the effect of shared perception.
