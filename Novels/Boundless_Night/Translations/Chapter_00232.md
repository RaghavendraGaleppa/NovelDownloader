# Chapter 232: Testing the Method

“You have slightly surpassed the most legendary disciple of the immortal sect’s training ground in a duel, already embarking on the path of legend. However, you must avoid arrogance and impetuosity, as that was merely a wisp of Chu Pianran’s consciousness, far from comparable to her true form.”

Such a voice echoed in Qin Ming's ears.

He realized he had indeed become fully immersed, as if he had truly returned to ancient times, facing a legendary figure of that era. The duel felt utterly real. At this moment, he seemed to be bathed in ancient glory, rising like a new star. At the very least, the ancient disciples of this training ground were all looking at him in this manner. Even the Immortal Path disciples from the present world were lost in thought. The impact of the battle they had just witnessed was immense. The strongest young warrior of the divine era would likely shine brightly even in this generation.

“I hope she’s already dead and didn’t live to see this era, otherwise, the trouble would be immense!” Qin Ming pondered. Should the purple-clad woman’s true form appear, she could undoubtedly crush him. Her cultivation was unfathomable, at least rooted in the Third Realm.

“Hmm?” Qin Ming felt uneasy, an inexplicable panic seizing him. His hairs stood on end as he sensed impending danger. He turned and immediately departed. Various profound arts resonated within him; Wood Essence Qi, Earth Qi, and other energies were drawn in, nearly boiling, lifting him several inches off the ground, as if he were levitating. The moment he landed, he executed the *Dragon-Serpent Scripture*. Dragon-Serpent Force erupted, black and white light swirling around him. He was like a dragon in the sky, able to fly briefly, streaking across the firmament. The instant he touched down, Qin Ming activated the *Immortal Butterfly Scripture*. Luminous wings seemed to unfurl from his back, like a divine butterfly flapping its wings—they were formed from Skyglow—allowing him to glide a significant distance once more. Throughout this process, he repeatedly pushed his speed to its limits.

Qin Ming mused on the source of the danger. Could that woman truly be alive, so furious that she was about to emerge and pulverize him?

In the distance, a blazing inferno appeared, burning fiercely, radiating crimson light, and accompanied by a verdant glow. It rose from the depths of the immortal training ground and then charged towards him at extreme speed.

“I heard a newcomer, seeking to rise, trampled upon Senior Sister Chu’s spiritual abode and offended her divine presence. If left unpunished, what respect for hierarchy remains in our sect?” A male voice echoed from within the flames.

Undoubtedly, it was a wisp of pure Yang conscious energy, emanating extremely terrifying fluctuations. In an instant, he materialized. A young man enveloped in a crimson blazing sun, wreathed in green light, seemed to be walking on azure clouds. This miraculous sight caused many ancient disciples to exclaim, “Senior Brother Zhao.”

“Zhao Shuyu, as a core disciple, you must not kill inner disciples.” A warning voice rang out.

The young man in the sky shook his head, saying, “A mere newcomer dares to act so impudently right after arriving? He must be punished. Even if it’s a slight violation, I can bear the consequences.”

Qin Ming immediately understood. This was likely a supporter of Chu Pianran, willing to attack him even if it meant violating the ancient sect rules. He dared not risk lingering, as he had entered with his true body. He didn't know if, after being severely wounded, he could safely leave like Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan.

“Hmm, a warrior, actually?!” Zhao Shuyu was drawing closer, his crimson sun radiating light as he rode on azure clouds, pursuing at extreme speed.

Qin Ming’s expression subtly changed. Was this yet another ancient person who was still alive? Otherwise, all the ancient disciples were merely characters in the play and wouldn’t be able to perceive his true state.

“A Third Realm master!” After landing, Qin Ming activated the *Golden Cicada Scripture*. Within his body, a sound like a cicada’s chirp resonated, accompanied by thunderous roars. With a rumble, although he didn’t take flight, his speed once again began to surge.

Behind him, Zhao Shuyu pointed a finger, and a long saber of pure Yang light materialized, striking out like lightning towards the figure ahead. At the last moment, Qin Ming, like a phantom traversing the Sea of Night Mist, shifted his body horizontally and increased his speed once more, about to burst out of the fog-shrouded mountain gate.

Zhao Shuyu let out a soft cry, seemingly employing an incantation. Intricate immortal script appeared on the pure Yang long saber before it exploded, affecting the entire area in front. Qin Ming dodged swiftly, but was still struck by a stream of light, immediately coughing up blood and being sent flying.

His heart was chilled. A core disciple of an ancient immortal training ground, after reaching the Third Realm, was terrifyingly strong. Even the aftermath of an attack had wounded him. If he had faced him head-on, he wouldn't have had a sliver of hope of survival. Who said immersion carried no danger? Joining such a sect might lead to encountering living core disciples who would obstruct them. If Qin Ming’s reaction had been a fraction of a second slower just now, he would have been killed.

Once he reached the outside, he had nothing to fear. In the distance, two elders appeared like ghosts or gods, arriving in an instant.

“What happened?” Yu Gensheng asked.

“I suspect there are living people in this training ground,” Qin Ming quickly informed them.

Zhao Shuyu clearly had no intention of giving up. He condensed another pure Yang long saber, which shot over like lightning. The saber light flying out of the mountain gate indirectly proved that he was not merely a character in the play.

Zhao Ziyuan reached out and gently flicked his finger. The several-meter-long saber shattered, transforming into pure Yang spiritual light that burned away, then completely dissipated.

Zhao Shuyu’s pupils contracted, and he retreated silently. “A small punishment for the newcomer, to serve as a warning.” Only after he had gone far did he utter this sentence. Did he want to make himself appear more like an ancient character in the play?

“He’s covering it up. That wisp of conscious energy is real,” Yu Gensheng said, watching his retreating back.

Zhao Ziyuan said, “Back during the great upheaval of Kunling, some ancients actually survived from that era until now. This is interesting.”

Qin Ming’s expression was solemn. A step slower just now would have been a dead end.

“You go back in later. We’ll guard nearby!” Yu Gensheng said.

Qin Ming had already brought out some immortal path medicinal formulas, exciting both elders. Coupled with Qin Ming’s desire to go inside and test theories, verifying certain issues on the path forward, the two naturally gave their full support.

“Don’t get too deeply immersed. Those are just nearly real experiences; your cultivation and dao cannot be brought out. Also, be wary of living people suddenly appearing.”

“Yes, I know,” Qin Ming nodded. He was well aware that there were truly existing great medicines, rare treasures, and the like inside, not just an experience. However, he probably wouldn’t be able to obtain them, as they were likely in the living areas.

Qin Ming healed his injuries. The damage inflicted by the living person was not merely part of the immersion; it was real and had carried over to reality.

Half an hour later, he re-entered the mountain gate. Soon, a voice echoed in his ears, informing him that he had become a provisional core disciple. To become a true core disciple, he would have to defeat someone like Zhao Shuyu and take their place.

“In ancient times, there probably wasn’t a concept like ‘near-immortal seed’. Core disciples must have been the highest-ranking disciples, and they’ve already reached the Third Realm. Forget it, that’s not for me right now.” Qin Ming wasn’t too fixated on this; provisional core disciple was good enough.

Immediately after immersing himself, he went to collect resources and found that the quality of the elixirs, food, clothing, and other provisions had significantly improved. He had warriors following him, and other disciples became his attendants. With a single word, he could order these people to help him with tasks. Furthermore, in this kind of experience, if he focused on a certain matter, it was as if he could ‘turn the page’, accelerating the process, quickly passing days, months, or even years.

Qin Ming was shaken. To test methods and make errors like this could yield incredibly valuable experience. No wonder Immortal Path disciples and esoteric sect disciples were rushing here like madmen.

“I need various malevolent energies, spiritual essences, exotic substances, Nine Heavens Pure Qi, and otherworldly materials,” he told his attendants. Provisional core disciples already had the authority to mobilize some valuable resources for their own use.

When Qin Ming first experimented, he was quite casual, choosing to refine Earth Mother Qi, Netherflame Malice, and Ethereal Heavenly Qi. This process was arduous and extremely time-consuming! During this period, he ‘consumed’ a large quantity of elixirs provided by the immortal training ground, enhancing his spiritual nature, accumulating cultivation, and cultivating the *Wind Control Scripture*, *Netherworld Scripture*, and *Withered Scripture*. He continuously ‘turned pages’, accelerating the progress of this experience, finally determining that he would need one or two years.

Qin Ming was stunned. He was now a provisional core disciple of the immortal training ground, with abundant resources. Did it really take this long to advance from the early Outer Sage realm to the middle Outer Sage realm? If he were a rogue cultivator, having to find these miraculous substances himself, cultivate assiduously, and meticulously refine them, how long would that take? No wonder Meng Xinghai sighed bitterly, saying that even a small step took ten years!

“This definitely won’t do!” Qin Ming shook his head.

Next, he examined his Skyglow. The malevolent energies and spiritual essences he refined this time did indeed cause Skyglow to change, and its power increased. However, it was far from what he had imagined, not a qualitative transformation. The reason his Skyglow was so dominant and formidable now was because of the incredibly solid foundation he had laid in the First Realm, making it no weaker than, and perhaps even stronger than, the Four Imperial Forces. This current change in Skyglow left him very disappointed! He reflected: he hadn’t seen enough highly destructive exotic substances, nor had he practiced many health-preserving scriptures. Overall, he hadn’t done well enough.

Qin Ming said, “Bring me the rarest items, the most peculiar exotic substances, and the otherworldly materials. I want to select them myself.” He felt that selection was crucial. The malevolent energies and spiritual essences he had used in his first refinement were too arbitrary. To achieve the strongest Skyglow, he needed to choose extremely dangerous things. He knew well that different ratios and combinations would yield vastly different Skyglows. Some dangerous items were precisely what he needed. The miraculous substances used by past patriarchs to nurture Skyglow must have been incredibly bizarre and terrifying. In fact, he felt that once the Skyglow Force underwent its ultimate transformation, all ‘external objects’ should be shed, to ‘wash away the lead and reveal the true essence’. However, in the process, he would have to ‘seek out wonders and hunt for oddities’ in the Night Mist World, searching for unique forbidden items, longevity spiritual sources, and the like.

Someone told him, “Forgive me, Senior Brother, your authority is not enough. You cannot mobilize those priceless exotic substances, otherworldly materials, and so on.”

Qin Ming was lost in thought. His rank wasn't high enough! He couldn't help but ask, “What priceless miraculous substances do we have in our treasury, and what are their origins?”

“Quite a few. Some fell from the void, some originated from the deepest parts of the Night Mist World, some are the sole remnants of deities, some are extracted from fallen stars, oh, and there’s also Kunling’s local Immortal Glue…”

Qin Ming instinctively felt that some of these things were incredibly rare in the world. If he could refine them, he could ‘nurture’ extremely terrifying Skyglow Force, making it truly undergo a qualitative transformation. But unfortunately, he couldn’t get them. These were accumulations from the immortal training ground over long ages, and his qualifications were far from sufficient to call upon them.

“Hmm, Immortal Glue?” Qin Ming felt it sounded familiar; he seemed to have heard of it before.

“It’s the sap of the Immortal Tree. It can bring the dead back to life and regrow flesh on bones. If a great disaster comes, our lineage can use it to preserve a portion of its ‘embers’, ‘freezing’ time, which is also a form of indirect longevity.”

Qin Ming immediately knew what it was. In the temple of the Fourth Forbidden Land, that woman had invited him to drink Fragrant Mist Tea. The ingredients contained in that incense were all priceless, including: powdered tip of the Purple-Gold Divine Whale’s horn, Tears of the Firmament from the deepest parts of the Night Mist World… And among them, there was even the sap of the Immortal Tree from the Kunling Ruins. In fact, that day, what Qin Ming drank wasn’t authentic Fragrant Mist Tea, but merely incense ash. Yet, it led him to an epiphany, its effect less than one percent of the genuine product. Now, hearing that the immortal training ground’s treasury contained Immortal Tree sap, his mouth practically watered.

“Is there anything particularly peculiar that I *can* mobilize?” Qin Ming asked.

Someone informed him, “There are discarded extraterrestrial objects, which will eventually be thrown away and buried because they are too dangerous; touching them could lead to death.”

“Bring them here! I want to study them!” Qin Ming’s spirits immediately lifted.
