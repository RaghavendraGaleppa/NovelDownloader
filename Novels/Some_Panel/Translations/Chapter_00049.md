# Chapter 49: Geniuses Should Be Valued (Part 2)

"All cultivation methods and spells within the sect will be open to me? Including top-tier cultivation methods, top-tier spells, and even Grand Divine Abilities?" Yang Ji gulped, truly astonished. The sect's benefits were too good, so good that he felt it was somewhat unrealistic. Could it be a pyramid scheme?

True Monarch Ling Gu chuckled, "Of course, we won't hand you the entire book. Instead, you'll receive them one scroll at a time for comprehension. Once you master one, you can apply to study the next."

"During this process, the greater the potential for comprehension you display, the higher your corresponding treatment will become."

"Let alone top-tier cultivation methods and spells, if you are truly outstanding, the sect would be eager to place all divine abilities and spells before you for cultivation. Besides, haven't you already learned half a move of a Grand Divine Ability from the Sword Dao Projection?"

True Monarch Ling Gu paused, then continued, "Genius disciples are valued most highly in our Canglan Sect. As long as you perform exceptionally, the sect will provide you with the corresponding cultivation resources. We will absolutely not be stingy like other sects, where disciples have to fight tooth and nail for a tiny pill. Such things do not exist in our Canglan Sect."

"If a sect fears wasting resources and thus fails to cultivate its outstanding disciples, it can only be said that such a sect is too short-sighted."

"For a sect to prosper eternally, it relies not on numbers, but on peak cultivators."

"A Soul Transformation Venerable can ensure a sect's strength, while a Void Refinement expert can elevate a sect to another level entirely."

"The sect spares no effort in cultivating Changxiao because the cultivation potential he has displayed is unmatched. The entire sect treats him as a Void Refinement seed."

"The sect will not suppress geniuses, because geniuses are the future of the sect."

"If your displayed comprehension talent is as outstanding as Changxiao's, then the sect will spare no effort to find spiritual objects that can enhance your innate aptitude. You will only need to cultivate in peace."

"Not only that, a spot to the Dao Sect will also be reserved for you."

"The Dao Sect, that place has Loose Immortals! Immortal artifacts, immortal qi, immortal pills, and all sorts of unimaginable and incredibly powerful divine secret arts are there. If one can join the Dao Sect, it's truly like stepping one foot into the Immortal Realm; the fortune is immense."

"Young friend, you were able to comprehend a move and a half from the Sword Dao Projection. It seems you are fated with our Canglan Sect. If you can join our sect, you will surely shine brightly and have boundless prospects."

True Monarch Ling Gu paused again, then smiled, "Of course, whether or not you join, all of this still depends on your personal will."

Such advantageous terms made it untrue for Yang Ji to say he didn't want to join. However, recalling his own cultivation and aptitude, he pondered for a moment before saying, "Senior, I am currently at the Ninth Level Qi Condensation. I wonder if I am qualified to join the sect?"

"You are at the Ninth Level Qi Condensation, with a low-grade innate aptitude. According to regulations, you would only be able to join as an outer disciple three years from now. To avoid breaking sect rules, I will personally come to pick you up in three years," True Monarch Ling Gu mused, then suddenly spoke.

"I wouldn't dare trouble True Monarch. This junior can make his own way there at that time," Yang Ji was truly overwhelmed with flattery. This sect was simply too good; they genuinely valued talent.

Li Changxiao glanced at Yang Ji, his gaze subtly shifting, then transmitted a message to True Monarch Ling Gu, "Martial Uncle, rules are meant to restrict the mediocre. With Junior Brother's comprehension, he can be admitted exceptionally. Why wait three years?"

"Changxiao, human hearts have many facets, and good and evil are hard to discern. You wouldn't want the sect to cultivate an evildoer, would you? These three years can be used to observe his temperament," True Monarch Ling Gu replied via spiritual transmission.

"Then I shall listen to Martial Uncle," Li Changxiao secretly nodded.

"Young friend, in that case, it's settled. I'll wait for you at the sect in three years," True Monarch Ling Gu stood up with a smile. Yang Ji and Li Changxiao followed him out of the secret chamber.

After only two steps, True Monarch Ling Gu turned back and said, "Oh right, young friend, why don't you come live with me on Changhuan Island? You can tell me if you need anything, and I can also look after your safety."

"No need, Senior. This junior is accustomed to living here." Living under the supervision of a Nascent Soul True Monarch was somewhat unbearable for Yang Ji, so he immediately shook his head and politely declined.

"Then, I will send a Golden Core disciple to be your Dao Protector for these three years, ensuring your safety," True Monarch Ling Gu said again.

"Senior, that's quite unnecessary. I am Brother Yang's elder brother, am I not his Dao Protector? I, Mang Biao, can guarantee his safety!" Mang Biao leaned in, patting his chest vigorously.

"Yes, Senior. With Brother Mang Biao here, there shouldn't be many in this Vile Demon Sea who can harm me." Yang Ji understood True Monarch Ling Gu's intentions. Sending someone over was half for his protection, and half for observing him.

The thought of someone monitoring his every move made him feel greatly uncomfortable.

Mang Biao was better; although he also monitored him, it was only to prevent him from leaving the island and didn't interfere with his life, which made him much more at ease.

And now, with the "senior and junior brother" relationship he shared with Li Changxiao, Mang Biao wouldn't dare to do anything detrimental even if he had a hundred times the courage. So, Yang Ji once again refused True Monarch Ling Gu's kind offer.

Upon hearing Yang Ji's words, Mang Biao was naturally overjoyed, constantly fawning and flattering, no longer displaying his former blunt and domineering aura, but instead looking exactly like a personal lackey. It seemed that for the sake of his illness, he had truly gone all out.

"In that case, very well!"

True Monarch Ling Gu eyed Mang Biao, then smiled at Yang Ji, "Young friend, it's my turn to guard Changhuan Island for the next fifty years. This means I will be in the Vile Demon Sea for most of the next five decades. If you have any needs, you can come find me anytime."

"Anytime? What exactly is Brother Yang's status? How can a Nascent Soul True Monarch, revered by all, be so good to him?" Mang Biao stared at Yang Ji, his eyes darting around. While utterly baffled, he also developed an unusual fawning intention.

It's always right to cling to the thigh of someone even a Nascent Soul True Monarch values!

"Thank you for your generosity, Senior. If this junior has any needs, I will certainly come to trouble you," Yang Ji bowed respectfully.

"Mm, then I shall return to Changhuan Island. Changxiao, what about you? Do you want to come to the island for a sit-down?" True Monarch Ling Gu looked at Li Changxiao.

"No, Martial Uncle, I plan to return to the sect," Li Changxiao replied.

"Mm, very good!" True Monarch Ling Gu swept his gaze over everyone, then ascended into the sky, disappearing into the distance.

"Junior Brother, in three years, I will meet you at the sect gates." Li Changxiao smiled faintly, then also leapt upwards, flying into the sky. He quickly turned into a black dot and vanished.
