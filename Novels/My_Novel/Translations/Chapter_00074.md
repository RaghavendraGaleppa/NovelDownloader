# Chapter 74: Circulating Qi Through the Meridians and Weaving Men into Sails

“That Bloody Palm Zheng is quite the character—a martial artist who has undergone a complete transformation.”

Pang Long glanced into the distance and slowly continued, “That said, he does have some grievances with our manor.”

“You’ve been a guard for some time now. If you’ve been observant, you should know that the Madam has many industries, including farming and sericulture.”

“Any business involving agriculture and sericulture inevitably离不开 water sources. The Madam once owned a plot of land whose upstream water source was cut off by Bloody Palm Zheng, causing the land to lie fallow for a time.”

“Oh?” Li Xian asked, “If that’s the case, why didn’t the Madam make a move to capture him?”

Though he didn’t know what kind of force the Black Water Gang was, he was sharp enough to realize the Madam was no ordinary person. Dealing with Bloody Palm Zheng of the Black Water Gang should have been a piece of cake for her.

“The Madam is a noble person; how could she involve herself in such disputes?” Pang Long said with a hint of pride.

In truth, he had similar doubts himself.

They walked for a while, soon leaving the forest and entering Huangyu County. They found a restaurant and ordered two meals.

While waiting for the food, Pang Long said uncertainly, “The Madam rarely interacts with the surrounding forces. I personally suspect there are two reasons for this.”

“Commander Pang, please go on.”

Li Xian took the hot tea, filled Pang Long’s cup, and offered it to him with both hands. Pang Long took it, took a sip to moisten his throat, and savored the tea’s fragrance before saying:

“First, it’s out of disdain. Although these gangs are local tyrants, the Madam is a person of great stature. Naturally, she disdains to make a move.”

“And the Madam lives in seclusion; to go out of her way for them would be giving them too much face.”

“Second… the Madam has seen the grand world. To her, such things are lighter than a goose feather.”

“Third… perhaps it has something to do with the Madam’s own feuds from the martial world.”

Having drained his cup of tea, Pang Long stopped his wild guesses.

The Madam’s thoughts were unfathomable.

“This meal is on me.”

“It’s been a long time since I’ve had roasted fish, braised pork, or lamb with vinegar and wine. Hahaha, you’re in for a treat.”

Pang Long ordered a full table of dishes. This time, he didn’t just plunge into the soup and wolf it down. Instead, he picked up the tender, smooth fish meat and savored it, appreciating its delicate flavor.

Li Xian gazed into the distance, worried about his younger brother. But then he suddenly thought, his brother was very smart, and he had already “plucked the flower”* and carried plenty of travel money with him.

With his intelligence, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to reach the provincial capital and successfully enroll.

Li Xian used tea as wine and took a big gulp, washing away all his worries. He felt a sense of carefree cheerfulness instead.

His brother had found his path.

As the older brother, he had to figure out how to make a name for himself too!

“Delicious!”

Li Xian ate large mouthfuls of rice and meat. Amidst the smell of cooking fire, his strength gradually recovered.

After eating and drinking his fill, they headed back to the manor.

[Four Directions Fist]
[Proficiency: 256/10,000 (Perfected)]

Over this period, Li Xian hadn’t deliberately practiced the Four Directions Fist. But after fighting someone last night, his proficiency in the fist art had clearly increased, which was a pleasant surprise.

[Clear Breeze Leg]
[Proficiency: 319/5000 (Great Mastery)]

[Green Jade Palm]
[Proficiency: 169/2000 (Proficient)]

All his martial arts had seen some progress.

“Commander Pang has two arts at Great Mastery, three at Minor Mastery, and five at Proficiency, plus ten years of bitter training, before he barely managed to circulate qi through the meridians.”

“I now have one art Perfected, one at Great Mastery, and one at Proficient, and I’m already very close.”

The quality of martial arts matters more than quantity.

On the premise of quality, having more is naturally better.

Li Xian sat cross-legged in the snow. He tried to circulate the meridians again, condensing qi into threads that绕行 through the acupoints, breaking through the 300 barrier and approaching 350…

“As long as I proceed step by step, circulating qi through the meridians is only a matter of ten days or so!”

Li Xian steadied his mind, neither anxious nor impatient.

Step by step, he had to ensure every step was solid.

He practiced his palm and leg techniques without cease. The lake of internal qi in his dantian went from a slight ripple, to a constant undulation, and finally to surging waves.

With each practice session, a trace of internal qi would quietly appear.

Qi comes from martial practice, and principle is understood through the fist.

One day, he suddenly had an insight. He executed the seventh form of the [Green Jade Palm]: Green Waves Crashing on the Sand. This palm technique emphasizes power and momentum, aiming to defeat the enemy with a single palm strike. Thus, it consumed a great deal of qi. As he struck, internal qi surged out of his body, churning up a flurry of snow like a wave.

[Proficiency +2]

His whole body trembled, and his internal qi condensed another fraction.

Li Xian chewed on some dried meat to restore his physical strength. After resting and feeling his internal qi was full, he immediately sat down. The qi threads绕行 through the 361 major acupoints.

Finally, Heaven rewards the diligent. He succeeded in completing the “Circulation of Qi Through the Meridians.”

The moment the qi thread connected its head and tail, Li Xian opened his eyes. He couldn’t quite describe the feeling.

He just felt his five senses were sharper, and he could vaguely perceive the subtle parts of his body. A wonderful feeling arose within him:

“Ah…”

“So this is what my body is like.”

A mortal’s clay body is a crude, unrefined thing. It leaks wind and water, unable to hold the essence of heaven and earth or contain his blood and qi.

That is why it constantly leaks away.

Circulating qi through the meridians is the first step to locking down his blood and qi.

Only at this moment could he be said to have taken the first step on the path of martial arts.

Li Xian suddenly heard a bird chirping lightly from a treetop. He leaped up, jumping much higher than usual. He was a good ten feet off the ground when he reached out with a swift, sharp hand and grabbed it.

The bird was now in his grasp.

“Haha, good bird, go on.”

Li Xian gently stroked the bird’s head and let it go. He wanted to find something to test his martial arts on.

He scooped up a handful of snow from the ground, infused it with qi and squeezed. The snow turned into ice crystals, which he tossed into the air, flying more than a dozen yards away.

His improvements were quite balanced across the board.

“Among all the guards, how many could possibly have achieved the Circulation of Qi Through the Meridians?”

So far, among guards of his caliber, the only one confirmed to have achieved “Circulation of Qi Through the Meridians” was Hua Hanying.

“Not enough, not enough!”

Li Xian clenched his fist.

The next step should be “Solidifying Blood and Closing the Apertures”!

Paper cannot wrap fire. Three days after Zheng Caiqi’s death, the news finally reached Bloody Palm Zheng.

“My son!”

Bloody Palm Zheng was enraged. He ordered a thorough investigation and captured Yang Cheng, who was originally one of the Black Water Gang’s thirteen flag-bearers, to find out the whole story.

The Black Water Gang got its name because there is a Black Water River near their territory.

This river flows through several regions, irrigating many places. The Black Water Gang acts overbearingly and has claimed the great river as its own.

The Mountain Wind Stronghold is also affected by this and holds a grudge against the Black Water Gang. It can even be said that they have long-standing enmity, with many conflicts and frictions arising from the water source.

Yang Cheng thought to himself that his life’s accumulation—power, reputation, and status—was all here. If he fled to a distant place, he would have to start over from scratch. This delay might very well bring his martial path to an end.

Weighing his options, he decided it would be better to defect to the Mountain Wind Stronghold.

But he was unlucky. Under normal circumstances, the chieftain, Ma Daozi, would have been happy to accept him. However, was a crucial period for the stronghold, and they were unwilling to clash with the Black Water Gang.

So, they pretended to agree but tied him up that very day.

They used him as a bargaining chip to negotiate with the Black Water Gang.

One could say that Yang Cheng, in his cleverness, had outsmarted himself. If he had fled elsewhere, in the vast sea of people, he might not have been caught.

In the end, his petty schemes were too many, and he was too attached to his status. By the time he wanted to regret it, it was already too late.

After several days of negotiations, Yang Cheng was tied up in a bundle and sent back to the Black Water Gang.

His knees were smashed, and he was forced to kneel in the main hall of the Black Water Gang.

The gang leader, Bloody Palm Zheng, sat with a grand and imposing air, his face covered in stubble. He looked coldly at Yang Cheng. “Flag-bearer Yang, I treated you well. Why did you kill my son!”

“Gang Leader, the Seventh Young Master wasn’t killed by me, it was… it was a youth!” Yang Cheng panicked, sweat beading on his head.

“Who!” Bloody Palm Zheng said.

“I… I don’t know his… Ah! I know, it’s… it’s Li Xiaofan’s older brother.”

Yang Cheng’s mind raced. He wanted to name the killer to appease the Gang Leader’s anger. He didn’t know who Li Xian was, but he knew the student who had “plucked the flower,” Li Xiaofan. The youth who had saved Li Xiaofan was a few years older than him.

So he made up a story, saying it was his older brother.

Little did he know he had hit the mark.

“Who is Li Xiaofan?” Bloody Palm Zheng asked.

“He… he is a student who ‘plucked the flower,’ from Qingning County,” Yang Cheng said.

“A student who ‘plucked the flower’?” Bloody Palm Zheng was surprised, then let out a cold snort. “So what if you ‘plucked the flower’? Before you’ve grasped the mysterious fortune, if you offend me, you’ll still suffer a fate worse than death!”

“Go investigate if this Li Xiaofan has an older brother.”

“As for you… Yang Cheng, you failed to protect your master and attempted to defect to the Mountain Wind Stronghold. According to gang rules, your limbs shall be severed, and you will be hung on a ship’s sail as a warning.”

Yang Cheng’s face turned deathly pale. He kowtowed, crying, “Gang Leader, spare my life, spare my life!”

“Spare your life?” Bloody Palm Zheng said. “Heh.” With that, he suddenly drew his blade. With a few swift horizontal and vertical slashes, he severed Yang Cheng’s hands and feet.

The speed of his blade was terrifying…

Yang Cheng’s four limbs were gone, but he didn’t feel the pain yet. It was only after three breaths that he let out a piercing scream.

Another three breaths passed, and the force of the blade at the wounds dissipated, only then did the blood begin to gush out.

Several men from the hall walked out, fetched some iron spikes, drove them into Yang Cheng’s bones, hoisted him up, and carried him out.

On the Black Water River, on the great ship of the Black Water Gang, hanging from the sails were rows of people with no hands or feet.

They had been woven into human-flesh “sails,” wailing in agony. It was a horrifying sight.
