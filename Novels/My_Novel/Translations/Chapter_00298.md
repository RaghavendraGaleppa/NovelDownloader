Chapter 298: Crushing Victory, the Might of the Residual Demon

The dancers swayed their figures and retreated from the stage. Commander Shi spoke in a clear, loud voice: "Everyone, the feast has come to an end. However, there is one unresolved matter that requires the use of this venue. If you wish to witness some excitement, you are welcome to stay."

This moment had been anticipated for a long time. Everyone was already aware of the situation and secretly excited, so no one left. All eyes turned to Commander Shi. Nan Gong Liuli felt a bit nervous, but seeing Li Xian’s calm and steady demeanor, she felt reassured.

Commander Shi said: "Over a month ago, there was a grand event at the Water Altar,想必 everyone has heard of it. That day, the newcomer Hua Wu Cuo of the Flower Cage Gate won the championship, without dispute."

The disciples all nodded, discussing noisily. Those in the know recounted the events of that day—how Li Xian was a dark horse, how he won, and how formidable he was. Those who didn't know listened with great interest, exclaiming in surprise. Occasionally, comments like "Long live the Flower Cage Gate" or "Who says the Flower Cage Gate has no talents?" could be heard. They all regarded him as a role model, hailing him as the Great Flower Thief.

The deeds of the flower thieves were naturally despicable and shameless. They bore a heavy infamy in the martial world. For the sect to suddenly produce such a figure, they felt a sense of pride and honor.

Hearing this, Li Xian felt a strange sensation in his heart, sighing: "It seems my identity as a flower thief is truly set in stone." Nan Gong Liuli’s face flushed slightly: "You aren't much better than an ordinary flower thief." She then said, half worried and half gloating: "But you'll have to use a pseudonym when you go out in the future. Otherwise, you'll definitely be hacked to death by spears and blades."

Commander Shi continued: "However, that grand event ultimately wasn't perfect; there was a flaw. That match was between Hua Wu Cuo and the disciple of Elder Hao Qing She, Zeng Xiao Ke. Although Hua Wu Cuo won, Elder Hao Qing She was suspicious, leading to an unpleasant scene at the time."

"I mediated and decided that matters concerning the young should be resolved by the young. We would choose another time for a rematch. However, a private duel is hard to convince the masses, and this matter concerns the fairness of the sect rules and the final result of the grand event. It would be improper for me to decide alone. Taking this opportunity with everyone present, let us all act as witnesses and see who truly wins or loses from that match."

His words were calm but sharp, putting both Hao Qing She and himself on the spot. If Li Xian wins, Hao Qing She’s unreasonable trouble-making would be confirmed, and she would lose great face before the many elders. If Zhao Lei wins, Shi Yufei’s favoritism would be confirmed.

Zhao Lei was already excited, feeling that if she made a move, she would win immediately. She cupped her fists and said: "Commander Shi, before we begin, there are some things that need to be made clear."

Shi Yufei said淡淡ly: "Speak."

Zhao Lei said: "According to the bet that day, if I win, what should happen to him?" She pointed a finger at Li Xian.

Shi Yufei said: "He shall be at your disposal." Zhao Lei smiled: "And his beautiful wife?"

Shi Yufei said: "Also at your disposal."

Zhao Lei laughed: "That is excellent. I hope Commander Shi follows the agreement and does not show favoritism." Her words disdained Li Xian and underestimated Commander Shi. This person was extremely unwise, and the elders nearby secretly shook their heads.

She pointed and gestured several times. Li Xian remained completely calm, composed as he drank a cup of tea. He asked: "Elder Hao, this junior also has some matters to confirm with you."

Hao Qing She narrowed her eyes but did not respond. Li Xian said: "Since Zeng Xiao Ke repeatedly demanded fairness, let us see it through to the end. If I lose, she can do as she pleases. But if I win... if I want her life, please do not blame me, Elder Hao."

His sharpness gradually emerged, his eyes fixed on Hao Qing She. As for Zhao Lei, he didn't even look at her.

He thought further: "I am already at odds with Hao Qing She, and we can no longer coexist on this island. Today, I must kill Zeng Xiao Ke. Since that is the case, let me escalate the conflict. If I can provoke Hao Qing She into attacking me, it might push Commander Shi to decide to expel Hao Qing She. Even if Commander Shi refuses to expel her, I can use this as an excuse to leave the Water Altar and avoid this venomous snake!"

Hao Qing She said: "You little brat, I didn't kill you that day, and yet you are so bold. Did I allow you to speak to me like this?"

Shi Yufei fixed his gaze on her, locking his aura onto her.

Hao Qing She knew there were many people here, and everyone would intervene, making it difficult to succeed in a fight. She coldly said: "Good disciple, go and capture this boy. Let's see how long he can remain arrogant."

Zhao Lei gracefully leaped onto the training platform. Here, red silk hung in decoration, the ground was vast, and the view was open. The elders at the side tables and the disciples at the round tables could all see the details of the arena clearly.

Li Xian wiped the Peach Blossom Spear and adjusted the Sunken River Sword at his waist. He rose from the cushion, his long hair moving without wind, the red mole between his eyebrows eye-catching. He walked slowly towards the platform, and everyone secretly marveled at his extraordinary handsome appearance. The many beauties and wives, confined to their residences, often kept lonely boudoirs, and their hearts fluttered incessantly. They all cheered inwardly.

Nan Gong Liuli drank wine and raised her eyebrows, a sense of pride in her heart. She thought: "This stinky little brother, when he gets serious, really is quite intimidating."

The Peach Blossom Spear was crimson red, its tip sharp, and its length perfectly suited his stature. Li Xian breathed evenly. Although he was confident and domineering, he did not underestimate his opponent. His gaze was fixed tightly on Zhao Lei.

Zhao Lei thought: "You ambushed me last time, and I suffered some losses. Today, on the擂台, I will be careful, and you won't be able to ambush me again. With your martial arts attainment, how can you match me?" Seeing Li Xian step onto the擂台, she felt as if she had already claimed victory.

There were no idle words between the two. After a moment of adjusting their breath, they engaged. Li Xian thrust the spear into the ground with a "thud," causing the entire platform to tremble, and dust rose four inches off the ground. This force shocked the onlookers, and even Hao Qing She was startled.

He charged forward, abandoning the use of the spear. Instead, he executed the "Green Wave Soaring Sky" move from the "Green Silk Palm." In their previous encounter on the street, Li Xian's palm had not even clashed with Zhao Lei before Commander Shi and Tang Feng intervened. He chose to start with this move to connect with the previous incident.

Zhao Lei was extremely arrogant. Looking down on her opponent, she naturally used the "Poison Kill Palm" to fight head-on. This time, their palms met, and no one stopped them. Only a "thud" was heard, and the Qi waves swept outward.

Zhao Lei let out a "ah" scream as she was sent flying and rolling. Her right arm, which had clashed with Li Xian's palm, was bent and broken, hanging limply. Her entire body's flesh and muscles were filled with immense force, and she suddenly felt the world spinning, her footing unstable, and a sweet taste in her throat. Although she came from a humble background, her life had been smooth. Her excessive arrogance made her unable to see her own weaknesses and her opponent's strengths; she was truly an extremely foolish character.

Li Xian reused his tactic, starting with the Green Silk Palm. She also reused her tactic, but her "Poison Kill Palm" had a twisting and killing Qi, which Li Xian already knew. However, the surging and mighty palm force of Li Xian's Green Silk Palm, she did not know.

That day, when the flying leaves shot over, Li Xian had been able to收放自如. This ability was already quite profound. If she were smart, she should have been on guard long ago. Unfortunately, she was incredibly foolish and didn't know that behind a simple palm strike, besides martial arts competition, there were also many calculations.

Her grand words turned into cries of agony. Although Zhao Lei was in pain, Hao Qing She's face was also extremely unsightly. Zhao Lei now felt fear and tried to retreat, stepping back several zhang to distance herself. She steadied her breath, and a five-colored poisonous mist emanated from her pores, enveloping her entire body.

This was the 'Colorful Cloud Immortal Robe Skill'. It was a low-level martial art, aimed at spreading poison like an immortal robe, beautiful and splendid. But inside, it was an extremely dangerous martial art. Practicing required soaking in poisonous soup, and over the years, poison sacs would grow under the skin. She spread the mist this time, and it instantly扩散 very wide.

Li Xian's belly formed a furnace, boiling and refining the Qi. He then activated the "Xun Wind Breath" martial art, blowing the refined Qi like a fierce wind. The white mist instantly消散 the poisonous mist. Zhao Lei hurriedly fled, rolling around the擂台, several times trying to spread strange poison and then施展 the Colorful Cloud Immortal Robe Skill, but the poison had not yet left her body before it was dissolved by the refined Qi.

Elder Tang Wenshu of the Earth Altar said奇特ly: "Strange, what martial art is this, so powerful?"

Shi Yufei stroked his beard and smiled: "Wu Cuo is a newcomer of the Flower Cage Gate, naturally he has some means of self-protection. This child's temperament is steady, not comparable to those杂货色."

Yan Hao praised: "Wu Cuo is indeed a talent. Not only is his martial arts talent exceptional, but his Five Elements strange evasion is also quite commendable. If the various elders are interested, after some contact, you will naturally know."

The elders of the Earth Altar whispered and discussed among themselves.

Hao Qing She frowned tightly, her face unable to hold. She thought: "What trick is this Zhao Lei playing? Her strength is not bad, how could she show signs of defeat at first glance? I特意 made the scene big, not to丢 my own face!" Her expression was awkward.

When she first saw the white mist, she felt it was strange, able to dissolve her poison. She had thought that although this mist was strange, it must be caused by some strange treasure to avoid poison, but looking again, it was definitely not the case.

Zhao Lei trembled with cold sweat; several attempts to施毒 were ineffective. She had originally wanted to humiliate Li Xian in various ways in front of everyone,欲 to turn him into a human vessel. But after just one move, she was already不堪一击.

She gritted her teeth and thought: "I practice poison arts, originally not擅长 with Qi and strength. Losing in a palm strike is not a big deal; it's just that he took advantage. Hmph, this white mist he spits out, able to disperse poison gas, must be that old man Shi's favoritism, giving him some treasure in advance that can avoid poison mist. He holds it in his mouth, acting so pretentiously, extremely hateful!"

She immediately tried another move, shaking her whole body, and a four-winged centipede flew out. This centipede was very special, its body contained potent poison, and it could穿石过隙, even defensive martial arts would find it hard to block. Moreover, this centipede moved swiftly through the ground and air, incredibly agile and fast, making it防不胜防.

It suddenly钻出 from underground, pouncing straight at Li Xian's face. Li Xian's dual pupils had immense vision, observing everything in minute detail. He immediately raised his spear to刺, sparks flew, and he struck the centipede, making it "hiss" in pain.

This centipede's scales were tough, which was beyond Li Xian's expectation. Although he injured it, he couldn't kill it in one blow.

Zhao Lei's poison arts were excellent. Her strength and ability were not weak, but she was克制 by the white mist and couldn't use any of it. She saw that the four-winged centipede was unharmed in the white mist, so she knew 'insect arts' could be useful. She was certain Li Xian had a treasure to克制 poison, and her heart was furious like madness. She immediately unleashed a frenzy of poisonous insects, determined to achieve victory.

Poison cockroaches, poison moths, poison spiders, poison snakes... these many poisonous insects were living things, not belonging to the "turbid" Qi, so the "refined Qi" was naturally useless. Zhao Lei paid a heavy price. Her sleeves were wide, and by right, they couldn't contain thousands of poisonous insects.

But with one wave of her sleeve, hundreds or thousands of poisonous insects would appear. It was terrifying. Her sleeves waved continuously, and poisonous insects crawled all over the擂台. This involved the 'Insect Breeding Poison Sutra' she had learned. This poison art was very complex, but it could make poisonous insects breed and mate on the spot. Thus, one became two, two became three, giving a feeling of endlessness.

Zhao Lei's chest drummed like thunder, and the spread of the poisonous creatures accelerated rapidly. They surrounded Li Xian from all sides, creating a feeling of covering the sky and sun. The disciples outside the arena felt their scalps tingle and goosebumps rise. Poison moths gathered in groups, like dark clouds blocking the light. Those crawling on the ground and flying in the air made it seem as if there was no way to heaven or earth.

Commander Shi frowned slightly. Although he didn't like Zhao Lei, she was indeed not bad.

Li Xian spat a mouthful of essence blood onto the spear tip. The tip immediately ignited with a red flame. Li Xian used the spear as a brush and blood as ink, drawing a circle on the spot. Fierce red flames burned, and poisonous insects crawling into the fire were burned black. However, there were too many and too vast a number of poisonous insects, and the poison moths spread poison powder,飘零 and scattering all over the sky.

Relying solely on blood fire, it was very difficult to deal with all of them. Li Xian remained composed, storing his Qi within the 'Pure Yang Qi Robe', and then震出 his internal Qi. A 'hum' muffled sound, an无形 wave spread,震毙 countless poisonous insects, while Li Xian remained unharmed.

Shi Yufei and other seasoned elders' eyes flashed with brilliance. They looked at each other and all thought of the 'Pure Yang Qi Robe', but they didn't dare to conclude. How rare is this turbid robe? How could it be encountered so easily? Or perhaps it's another martial art that produces a similar effect?

Li Xian震 his body several times. No matter how many poisonous insects there were, they couldn't get close. The poisonous insects bred, giving a sense of endless life, but the insects were tiny. No matter how many there were, with one shake of his robe, they were all killed.

Zhao Lei's ruthlessness had been aroused, her viciousness激. She gritted her teeth. Although the Insect Breeding Poison Sutra could make poisonous insects reproduce, if they reproduced too much, her control would weaken. At that time, her insect arts would失效, and the poisonous insects would scatter and fly everywhere, making victory even less likely.

Li Xian observed calmly. He also noticed this anomaly. When the poisonous insects first appeared, they indeed covered the sky and earth,势如席卷. At the same time, they were not without refinement. For example, the poison spiders crawling on the ground, originally欲 to attack the lower body, suddenly spat silk,缠在 a moth, which carried it flying, suddenly jumping at the face.

There was order within chaos, with real and fake changes.

There were also声东击西,顾左击右...

The attack of the poisonous insects暗合 the principles of martial arts. However, human martial arts are concentrated on the body, on the hands and feet. And this martial art principle is distributed among the poisonous insects. But after Li Xian震 his robe several times, the poisonous insects suffered heavy casualties. The later generations that were bred lost this martial art principle. They all turned into杂乱围袭, even less worthy of mention.

After several stalemates, Li Xian seemed to be at a disadvantage, but in reality, he firmly held the high ground, carefree and secure. Zhao Lei saw that his internal Qi was abundant and knew it couldn't be拖ged for long. She immediately奏起 "Lingering Immortal Sound". The many poisonous insects, hearing the sound, retreated like a tide, crawling back onto her entire body.

She controlled the insects like her hands and feet. Extremely exquisite, she immediately施展 a "Ten Thousand Spider Whip" martial art. Countless poison spiders吐丝 intertwined, forming a long whip. Her Qi followed the whip, and its killing power was quite formidable.

Li Xian held the long spear, its tip stained with fire. With several thrusts, he截断 and shattered the Ten Thousand Spider Whip. Zhao Lei had already fallen into a complete defeat, yet still resisted desperately. Using the poisonous insects covering her body, she engaged Li Xian in close combat.

Fists and feet exchanged moves. Her poisonous insects sometimes blocked his vision, sometimes attacked from left and right. It was truly exquisite, but Li Xian possessed the "Pure Yang Qi Robe", and the poisonous insects and beasts found it extremely difficult to get close. He handled the situation with ease and leisure.

Zhao Lei's eyes were full of resentment. She thought that如果不是 Commander Shi showed favoritism and gave Li Xian a treasure to avoid poison, she could easily win with just her poison arts. Now her moves were exhausted, while Li Xian had only just begun to show his sharpness.

Zhao Lei knew she was about to lose, and distractedly shouted: "Commander Shi, you are unfair!"

Li Xian was very surprised, thinking: "This woman, seeing she is about to lose, is delirious. Her skills are truly not enough to make her so arrogant. But Hao Qing She is also present. If I kill her while she is speaking, Hao Qing She will seize the opportunity to make trouble, and this matter will never end. I need to win beautifully." He kicked her in the side of the face, sending her flying several zhang. Then he withdrew his spear and stepped back.

Shi Yufei was startled, and said: "The擂台 match, everyone has witnessed. How can you say it is unfair?"

Zhao Lei shouted sharply: "If you hadn't given this boy a treasure to avoid poison in advance, he would have long been defeated by me! Commander Shi, you are unfair!"

Shi Yufei said: "You woman, truly rare. When did I give him a treasure? What treasure to avoid poison, this old man has never heard of it."

Zhao Lei questioned: "He spits white mist, how can it消 my poison arts? How do you explain this?" Shi Yufei said: "Why should this old man explain to you? This is Wu Cuo's own opportunity. Whether it is a treasure or a skill. Moreover... this move Wu Cuo already used at the grand event. Could it be that from that time, this old man was already favoring him?"

Zhao Lei shouted: "I am不服. Master, please uphold justice for me."

Hao Qing She's eyes flickered. Seeing Zhao Lei's sophistry and lack of martial arts demeanor, although she was eccentric and漠视人命, her face also couldn't hold. The many elders all looked at her, making her feel she had lost all face.

Li Xian originally wanted to hear what Zhao Lei had to say, but it was just such sophistry. He said: "Zeng Xiao Ke, since you are so不服, then watch closely. If I truly wanted to defeat you, you wouldn't even be able to施展 your poison arts. Why would I need to borrow some treasure to avoid poison?"

As his words fell. A ghostly aura surrounded him, and Li Xian's figure was shrouded in a chilling aura. The sound of ghostly wails lingered. Zhao Lei suddenly felt her whole body go numb, as if blinded by a ghost. She felt Li Xian's figure disappear. Immediately after, her right arm hurt, and a long spear had pierced through her arm.

Li Xian said: "This is [Panic and Confusion]." The spear technique was so fast it was invisible. In an instant, he thrust hundreds of times. Each thrust was not fatal, but it had the effect of startling gods and frightening ghosts.

Each thrust of the spear sent gusts of wind, causing the red silk decorations on the擂台 to fly everywhere. Originally, the red-sleeved stage was a place for music and dance. Now, it was also music and dance. But the music was ghostly music, and the dance was ghostly dance.

In that instant... on the擂台, there seemed to be a scene of demons dancing wildly. Charming, demons, ghosts, and spirits, rampant and evil.

Shi Yufei and Yan Hao both stood up, their expressions excited, saying: "Good, good, in such a short time... Wu Cuo's Residual Demon Spear has improved again!"

Zhao Lei faced the "Residual Demon Spear" with no room to resist. Li Xian's [Panic and Confusion] was enough to kill her. But he only injured her skin and flesh, delaying taking her life.

He saw that Zhao Lei's eyes were full of不服. He also knew this woman was vicious by nature, arrogant to the sky, but in reality, she didn't have that ability. He依次施展 "Residual Crow Defeating the Moon", "Red Demon Playing in the Water"... and many other ghostly spear techniques.

The disciples of the Flower Cage Gate had何曾见过 such martial arts. For a moment, they were莫名 excited, and actually cheered and danced like monsters and ghosts, like charming, demons, ghosts, and spirits, shouting strangely.

When Li Xian danced the spear, he truly had the spirit of拨动 wind and moving clouds, and捭阖 heaven and earth. It was quite感染, full of spirit and style... all显 in the spear's momentum. The elders of the Earth Altar exclaimed in admiration. Shi Yufei stroked his beard and smiled. Yan Hao drank and nodded. Ye Cheng leaned forward, Meng Han spilled his wine...

The many beauties and wives were even more mesmerized, feeling dizzy.

Zhao Lei initially wanted to resist, but after taking a few spear thrusts, her expression became terrified. Each of these thrusts was enough to take her life. Her poison arts, insect arts, and palm techniques could not block this martial art.

Her eyes were blinded by ghosts, and she couldn't see where Li Xian was. She had an unreasoned arrogance since childhood, and this arrogance was now crushed to pieces, turning into deep fear. Suddenly, she let out a "ah" scream, her mind fled, and she fled in panic, rushing out of the擂台.

Li Xian's killing intent brewed, but he did not pursue. He asked: "Commander Shi, who won this battle?"

Shi Yufei said happily: "Naturally, you did." Li Xian said: "Then according to the agreement, how to deal with Zeng Xiao Ke should be my decision?"

Shi Yufei said: "Her treasures are all yours. If anyone has any objections, they can come and discuss with this old man."

Li Xian said: "Good, this disciple is now going to kill this woman." Shi Yufei nodded in agreement, secretly glancing at Hao Qing She. He knew that Li Xian spoke so bluntly, wanting Shi Yufei to help, to keep Hao Qing She in check.

Li Xian said softly to Nan Gong Liuli: "You go back to the Green Ox Residence first." Nan Gong Liuli nodded.

Zhao Lei was defeated on the spot, terrified beyond measure. This unreasoned arrogance of hers had come without reason. To dissipate it, it was actually simple. Just meet a true expert, be utterly defeated, and it would be completely散ed.

By then, even if she had higher martial arts, she would fall back to the mud. Unfortunately, Zhao Lei practiced poison arts, and since she started learning martial arts, she had never suffered a setback. She was擅长 at施毒, always defeating people silently.

Today, she fought Li Xian on the擂台. She used all her means, but couldn't do anything to him. Later, when her mind was fragile, she was scared out of her wits by the Residual Demon Spear. When fleeing, she even forgot to use her lightness skill.

She ran straight back to her residence,蜷缩 in a corner of the room. Her face was pale with fright. Li Xian followed the trail back, the spear tip pointing straight at Zhao Lei's throat. Zhao Lei smelled the scent of death and naturally begged for mercy in every way, showing all her ugly sides. She even talked about her tragic background and the hardships along the way, just to plead for her life.

Li Xian knew this woman was vicious by nature and ruthless in her methods. He decisively thrust his spear. Zhao Lei resisted desperately,欲 to施展 poison arts. But it was too late, and she was killed under the spear.

Li Xian thought: "This woman's mind is incomplete. It's only because she met Hao Qing She that she could achieve this. Even if she doesn't die by my hand, she will surely die by someone else's hand someday."

He used the "Heart Fire" characteristic, combined with the "Vomiting Blood Classic", spitting赤色 blood fire to burn the corpse to ashes. Zhao Lei practiced poison arts, soaked in poison baths daily, and the poisons had long soaked her entire body. After death, her skin and flesh swelled. When burned, "噗嗤" a sound, yellow-green pus water bubbled out, spreading a layer of poison gas.

After the corpse was burned, a layer of poison liquid remained around.

Li Xian spat white mist to dissolve the poison liquid. At this moment, he suddenly heard "呃呃", "cough cough"... and other strange sounds coming from the inner courtyard. He quickly went to investigate and saw six human vessels hanging from the blood-neck tree, trembling violently.

But because their tongues were cut and their throats were哑, they couldn't let out a single sound.

It turned out...

These six tragic human vessels were each tortured by Zhao Lei to cultivate poisonous insects. After Zhao Lei died, the poisonous insects had a hidden感应 and fell into a frenzy, biting wildly. They endured the pain, naturally twisting and struggling.

But because they couldn't hear, they didn't know what was happening.

Li Xian's heart tightened: "This Zhao Lei is truly worthy of death, her methods so cruel. Among these people, four women and two men... after being摧残 by her like this, the pain they endured is unimaginable. She once said she wanted to turn me into a human vessel,想必 is like this. I ended her with one spear, it was truly too cheap for her!"

"They suffer so, they are ultimately extremely pitiful. If I have the ability, I will do my best to help them escape their suffering!"

He immediately observed, seeking a solution. These many poisonous insects穿皮过肉, hiding deep within the flesh, making nests and points. It is extremely difficult to catch them with ordinary methods.

And these human vessels had their hands and feet broken, their entire bodies covered in bloody holes, dripping with blood. Their appearance was骇人. It might be better for them to die like this. Li Xian didn't think too much, using the "Chasing Cloud Hand" move "探云取物".

These poisonous insects' feet and tools had barbs. Pulling them directly would tear off large pieces of skin and flesh. "探云取物" aimed for lightness. With a pinch and lift of his fingers, before the poisonous insect could察觉, it was抓出. Li Xian then applied a little force and crushed the insect to death.

Soon, most of the poisonous insects were抓出.

A few poisonous insects remained,钻 deep into the flesh, and there was no way to get them out. Li Xian thought: "This method of引虫 might be藏 in the room." So he entered the room to search.

Soon, he found the method of引虫. Following the method, he引 the poisonous insects from deep within the flesh out, then夹 with his fingers and带出 from the body. Li Xian secretly felt a chill. Six human bodies were养ing nearly a thousand centipede. Some were as细 as hair, some as粗 as fingers...

Suddenly, one person trembled all over, their breath stopped, and they died. Immediately after, the second, third, fourth... all trembled and died on the spot.

It turned out... they endured the suffering, suddenly feeling no more insect bites, feeling a great relief, their minds松散, and thus died.
