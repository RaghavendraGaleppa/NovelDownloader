# Chapter 92: Anomaly of the Iron-Stem Orchid

For dinner, Chu Ning ate several bowls of spirit rice himself, while also serving a bowl to Little Spirit. The little fellow no longer showed the hesitant expression it had yesterday. It seemed to know that this would be its future sustenance and obediently began to eat.

After dinner, Chu Ning tidied up a bit and returned to his room. Without rushing to cultivate, Chu Ning picked up the jade slip containing the Illusionary Transformation spell with great interest. After a brief understanding of its contents, he immediately became very interested.

This Illusionary Transformation spell had no specific attributes or ranks. According to its description, the method involved using spiritual power to alter the shape of one's bones and muscles throughout the body. Therefore, once mastered, one could freely change their height and appearance. Moreover, even if investigated by someone with higher spiritual power or divine sense, because the Illusionary Transformation truly altered bones and muscles, they might be able to tell that a secret art was used, but wouldn't be able to discern the original appearance.

"Since it's a spell without specific attributes, for me, it's no different from a wood-elemental spell. I should be able to cultivate it quickly then." Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately reread the contents of the jade slip several times, committing them firmly to memory.

Following this, Chu Ning began to alter his bones according to the methods described in the Illusionary Transformation spell. As it was his first attempt, Chu Ning didn't dare to start directly with his face. He tried to slightly shorten one of his feet. As spiritual power circulated, his left foot felt a strange, subtle squeezing sensation. The next moment, when Chu Ning placed both feet together, he was surprised to find his left foot was indeed a segment shorter than his right. Spiritual power circulated again, and the foot immediately returned to normal.

"Interesting." Intrigued, Chu Ning began to experiment repeatedly with his feet, making them larger one moment and smaller the next... And as Chu Ning inadvertently glanced at a certain part of his body, a strange thought arose. However, the thought was quickly dismissed; that part had no bones anyway. He continued to experiment on other parts of his body. Instantly, his entire person became tall and short, fat and thin in rapid succession.

What particularly surprised Chu Ning was that after using the Illusionary Transformation spell, it didn't require spiritual power to maintain the effect. Spiritual power was only needed when reverting to the original form. Moreover, once the bones transformed, the muscles within would also change accordingly, making it appear very natural. After practicing on all the bones in his body until he was proficient, Chu Ning finally set his sights on his slightly refined face.

He picked up a mirror and began using the Illusionary Transformation spell to adjust his face. The next moment, he nearly dropped the mirror. Facial adjustments were much more subtle; he had just been careless, failing to align the bones on both sides of his cheeks to the same height, causing his entire face to slightly twist. His appearance was truly indescribable.

He readjusted, and after several attempts, Chu Ning finally became more proficient, meticulously shaping his face little by little. After a series of adjustments, his original slightly refined face vanished. In its place was a young man with an extremely ordinary face. Immediately, Chu Ning applied the Illusionary Transformation spell to his body, making himself a bit shorter. At the same time, the Qi Refining Sixth Layer aura, which his Tiger Wood Spirit Body had been suppressing, was directly released.

Looking at this completely different face, Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction. He then stood up, left his room, and walked a circle around the courtyard. After feeling no discomfort and no impact on his spiritual power or other spells, Chu Ning couldn't help but chuckle.

"Even someone who sees me every day wouldn't recognize me, let alone someone who doesn't." Chu Ning had just thought of this.

"Ying!" A sound rang out, and Little Spirit looked over. A hint of alertness flashed in its two small eyes, but soon, this trace of alertness completely vanished. Then, its two small eyes rolled, and it let out another "Ying!" sound towards Chu Ning. It was as if it was saying, "I know it's you."

This immediately startled Chu Ning. "Is this Illusionary Transformation spell so useless? Little Spirit can see through it with one glance?" However, as this thought crossed his mind, Chu Ning felt it wasn't right. Recalling Little Spirit's unique qualities, he thought it might have other ways of distinguishing. The best way was to find an acquaintance the next day to verify it.

That night, Chu Ning tirelessly practiced the Illusionary Transformation spell. He even tried transforming into his face from his previous life, feeling a touch of melancholy for a moment.

The next morning, after breakfast, Chu Ning took Little Spirit out of the market. He then directly took out his Wind Chasing Shuttle, preparing to head to the spirit fields.

"Come on, let's go for a ride!" Chu Ning spoke to Little Spirit, using his divine sense to tell it to perch on his shoulder. Little Spirit nimbly jumped onto Chu Ning's shoulder. Chu Ning then stepped onto the Wind Chasing Shuttle. At the same time, spiritual power surged into his feet, and the next moment, the Wind Chasing Shuttle soared into the air.

Then it streaked across the sky, darting straight forward.

"So fast!" Chu Ning, caught off guard, almost stumbled but managed to steady himself in time.

"Ying!" Little Spirit, at this moment, also looked curious and delighted.

"You certainly know how to enjoy yourself," Chu Ning said to Little Spirit with a smile. "You look quite formidable, when will you fly yourself?"

"Ying!" What he received was Little Spirit's slightly aggrieved whine.

Chu Ning briefly felt the speed, and his eyes brightened. The speed of this Wind Chasing Shuttle was three times faster than his previous Wind Manipulation. The spirit fields, which originally took a quarter of an hour to reach, were now arrived at in just a short while. Putting away the Wind Chasing Shuttle, Chu Ning felt a subtle lingering desire. The distance was still too short; he hadn't even fully indulged his craving. Chu Ning then smiled and shook his head; this was probably just like driving in his previous life: always wanting a car when he didn't have one, but once he actually had one, he'd get tired of driving it.

Little Spirit looked at Chu Ning's expression, revealing a cute, confused look, seemingly not understanding what Chu Ning meant. Chu Ning didn't pay attention to the little fellow. He observed the growth of the Purple Crystal Bamboo and Golden Yuan Fruits, then began casting the Azurewood Spring Bloom spell. Both spiritual plants were doing well, and as his cultivation improved, the effect of the Azurewood Spring Bloom spell seemed to get better and better. After applying the Azurewood Spring Bloom spell to all the spiritual plants, Chu Ning didn't linger and left the spirit fields directly for his courtyard.

The Purple Crystal Bamboo, due to a few days' delay, wasn't currently providing very good support for cultivation. Although the Iron-Stem Orchids in his courtyard weren't fully grown, the Azure Spirit Fruits were growing quite well. Moreover, these two spiritual plants absorbed spiritual qi faster, making them more effective for cultivating the Azurewood Everspring Art. Chu Ning still planned to cultivate those two spiritual plants as quickly as possible.

However, Chu Ning also hadn't forgotten his intention yesterday to test the Illusionary Transformation spell. So, he directly cast the Illusionary Transformation spell within the spirit fields, changing into another appearance. At this moment, his gaze turned to Little Spirit. If Little Spirit continued to follow him like this, it would inevitably be seen by others in the market. Others would naturally recognize it at a glance, which would actively expose his ability to use the Illusionary Transformation spell.

"Little Spirit, come into the spirit beast pouch." Chu Ning took out his spirit beast pouch and waved at Little Spirit. Little Spirit glanced at it, its small head shaking constantly. Chu Ning frowned, "You can usually stay outside, but when I have business, you must go into the spirit beast pouch, otherwise..."

The little creature was extremely intelligent; it seemed to understand that Chu Ning was serious, and then it responded with a "Ying!" in agreement. Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction, used the spirit beast pouch, and directly put Little Spirit inside.

Immediately after, Chu Ning began to ride the wind towards the market. He naturally didn't use the Wind Chasing Shuttle, as he was currently in another form. Upon entering the market, Chu Ning saw that Gu Xiaoqing's shop was open, so he walked straight over. Since it wasn't a market day, there were usually fewer customers, and Gu Xiaoqing wasn't standing guard at the front of the shop. After Chu Ning arrived at the shop and called out, Gu Xiaoqing emerged from the inner room.

"Fellow Daoist, what kind of pills do you wish to buy?"

"Do you have any Energy Gathering Pills?" Chu Ning asked. His voice had also changed; it was less youthful and rougher, not as clear as before.

"Yes," Gu Xiaoqing said, taking out a jade bottle from her storage bag. "Ten spirit stones per pill. How many do you need?"

Chu Ning took out 100 spirit stones from his storage bag. "Give me ten, then."

"There are exactly ten pills in this bottle," Gu Xiaoqing said, handing over the jade bottle.

Chu Ning took it but didn't leave immediately. Instead, he deliberately and slowly opened the bottle cap to look, then took out a pill and sniffed it. This allowed Gu Xiaoqing ample time to observe him. Seeing this, Gu Xiaoqing smiled and said, "These are genuine, mid-grade, low-level Energy Gathering Pills. We are from the Azure Stream Sect, so Fellow Daoist can rest assured."

Chu Ning nodded, then deliberately inquired about two types of higher-grade pills. Then, under Gu Xiaoqing's surprised gaze, he left the shop.

"This person is clearly only at the sixth level of Qi Refining, yet he wants to buy higher-grade pills, and he didn't even come on a market day. A bit strange," she muttered.

Chu Ning released his divine sense, perceiving Gu Xiaoqing's murmuring behind him, and a faint smile appeared on his face. His series of actions and words had completely drawn Gu Xiaoqing's attention. Yet, the other party showed no signs of recognizing him, which greatly relieved Chu Ning. The Illusionary Transformation spell was indeed effective.

Leaving the market, Chu Ning found an deserted spot and reverted to his original appearance. Only then did he return normally to his shop's courtyard. For now, the Illusionary Transformation spell had no immediate use for him. However, for the always cautious Chu Ning, he felt that this item would be useful sooner or later.

Arriving at the backyard, Chu Ning prepared to apply some Azurewood Spring Bloom spells to the Azure Spirit Fruits and Iron-Stem Orchids again, and incidentally use the Azure Spirit Fruits to cultivate the Azurewood Everspring Art. But as his gaze swept over the Iron-Stem Orchids, he was suddenly taken aback. The growth of four Iron-Stem Orchids was distinctly better than the others. The next moment, Chu Ning's gaze turned to Little Spirit in surprise. These Iron-Stem Orchids were precisely the ones that Little Spirit had peed on yesterday.
