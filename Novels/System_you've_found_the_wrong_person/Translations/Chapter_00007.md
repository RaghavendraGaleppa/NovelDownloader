# Chapter 7: Enemies Are Riding This Way  

The northern wind howled like a blade, whipping up clouds of dust.  

A broad-palmed hand with thick fingers held a bronze mirror. The mirror gleamed golden with clear leopard-pattern engravings, though its surface was smudged, as if coated in grease, distorting the reflection into a hazy, indistinct image.  

The owner of the hand was a short, dark-skinned middle-aged man, standing no taller than five feet. His narrow eyes squinted as he studied the bronze mirror in his palm, watching Wang Xiong being struck down by a single sword stroke.  

With a sneer, he remarked, "Another fool."  

"I gave him fair warning, but he refused to listen."  

"That Dou Changsheng is just a country bumpkin—how could he possibly cultivate innate qi?"  

"The information is real, but the real Dou Changsheng has long since vanished, probably living it up somewhere. The one we're dealing with now is an impostor."  

A tall, slender figure in a high hat and flowing robes stood a few feet away, gazing into the distance. "There's no mistake."  

"That innate qi is undoubtedly from the *Three Origins Return to Qi Art*."  

"The Wang Clan of Xiangzhou is definitely involved."  

"Despite the Prime Minister's repeated warnings, the Wang Clan has ignored them—not only sending someone but even a direct descendant."  

"At his age, achieving innate qi marks him as a chosen talent, destined to compete for a place on the Human Rankings, make a name for himself, and uphold the Wang Clan's prestige."  

The short, dark man chuckled coldly. "A shame."  

"He won't live to see that day."  

"Getting involved in the Northern Conflict was his death sentence."  

"Even if he were a Pure Yang Grandmaster, he'd be doomed—let alone a mere junior like him."  

"I, the Earth Walker, despise people like him the most—those who rely on their family's influence and a bit of talent to act arrogantly."  

"If he'd stayed quietly in Xiangzhou, I wouldn't dare touch him. But now, he's no longer a Wang."  

"That Ironclad Mad Lion, Wang Xiong, turned out to be all bark and no bite. Still, he served his purpose—he exposed Dou Changsheng's true strength."  

The tall-robed man nodded. "Indeed."  

"That sword strike just now was masterful, far beyond ordinary skill."  

"The precision suggests at least a decade of practice. To have such flawless fundamentals at his age—truly impressive for a noble scion."  

"If all his sword techniques are this polished, he'd be a terrifying opponent."  

"But that strike had several openings."  

"It proves he's only just begun learning this technique."  

"To conceal his Wang Clan origins, this descendant has gone to great lengths."  

"Still, using swordplay now doesn't necessarily reveal his true skills. After all, this isn't a life-or-death struggle. If pushed to the brink, he wouldn't stubbornly stick to a newly learned technique."  

"He's undoubtedly an innate martial artist—and a formidable one at that."  

"So we must proceed with caution."  

The Earth Walker said gravely, "Noble heirs train from childhood under their elders' guidance, with no shortage of resources. They're all-rounders—swordsmanship, palm techniques, footwork, and qi mastery—with no weaknesses. Their strength is unquestionable."  

"So, Wind Wings, we brothers mustn't act recklessly. Charging in blindly like Wang Xiong would be suicide."  

Wind Wings chuckled. "Wang Xiong was promoted by the Prime Minister, breaking through to innate level. But what kind of techniques does he even know?"  

"What profound fist arts has he mastered?"  

"To think he dared confront a Wang Clan descendant alone."  

"As if the *Three Origins Return to Qi Art* were made of paper."  

"The Wang Clan of Xiangzhou has endured for a thousand years, weathering countless storms. How many heroes and villains have risen and fallen, yet their name still stands tall over Longma?"  

"How many prodigies, famed masters, and demonic experts have fallen to this very technique?"  

"So we'll use the pawns at our disposal. The Hu people have spent years preparing, cultivating forces in the north."  

"The Black Horse Gang, which roams three counties, plundering but not killing, is funded by the Hu."  

"These men have already been handed over to the Prime Minister. We'll use them as fodder."  

"The Black Horse Gang's leader may only be a peak post-natal martial artist—inferior even to Wang Xiong—but his hundred mounted brothers wield sabers with real skill."  

"Even the mightiest warrior can't hold off a pack of wolves. In open terrain, an ordinary innate martial artist would be no match."  

"Even if this Wang descendant is extraordinary, the gang can exhaust his qi and stamina while revealing his techniques."  

"Once the time is right, we'll strike together and ensure victory."  

The Earth Walker muttered a few words before reaching into his robe and pulling out a manual. "Wind Wings, you're the fastest. Deliver this yourself."  

"We're not sending the Black Horse Gang on a fool's errand. These saber-wielding riders may seem fierce, but their strength lies in their horses."  

"With this military manual, their leader can unite his hundred men into a single force, combining their power."  

Wind Wings took the book, flipping through it briefly before exclaiming, "This is forbidden literature—basic formations, but still prohibited."  

"It's nothing complex, just a method to synchronize their qi, merging a hundred men into one. That alone could make the Black Horse Gang a real threat."  

"Right now, any innate martial artist could slaughter them in open combat. But with this, their leader could briefly match an innate expert—and once the gang assembles, escape would be impossible."  

"The Black Horse Gang colludes with the Hu. Isn't this aiding the enemy?"  

The Earth Walker replied coldly, "Without proper incentive, why would they fight wholeheartedly?"  

"The leader knows that even if he loses his hundred men, with this manual, he can rebuild and rise even higher."  

"A mere manual in exchange for our safety—isn't that worth it?"  

"Besides, once we're done, we can just kill these Hu collaborators."  

"And once we obtain the Pure Yang Grandmaster's blood, with the Prime Minister's treasures and techniques, we'll break through to the next realm."  

"If the Great Jin becomes too hot for us, we can always flee to Eastern Qi or Western Qin."  

"With strength, the world is ours to roam."  

Wind Wings sighed. "Dirty work is never easy."  

"But for rogue cultivators like us, how else can we rise?"
