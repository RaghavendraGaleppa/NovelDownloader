# Chapter 11: Little Cang Mountain  

As the one-month deadline approached, Qin Chong headed toward the valley entrance.  

No longer searching for spirit herbs and traveling during daylight, flying through the valley was relatively safe.  

Qin Chong had harvested over fifty spirit herbs on this trip. Though most were of low maturity, they could still be exchanged for nearly two hundred spirit stones. Including the portion he had kept for himself, this journey had been quite fruitful.  

When he arrived at the valley entrance, many cultivators had already gathered. Some clustered in small groups, while others, like Qin Chong, stood alone.  

Judging by their expressions, everyone seemed in high spirits, clearly satisfied with their gains—a stark contrast to when they had first arrived.  

Suddenly, a streak of light descended, and a figure landed right beside Qin Chong—it was the scruffy old man, Zhao Yin.  

"Brother Zhao, you must have had quite the harvest this time," Qin Chong greeted him warmly.  

"Harvest my ass! I almost got myself killed," Zhao Yin grumbled.  

Qin Chong frowned slightly. It seemed the old man had encountered a tough opponent. With his seventh-level Qi Refining cultivation and his Flame Tiger, Zhao Yin should have been able to contend with peak Qi Refining cultivators.  

"What happened?"  

"Ah, just rotten luck. Ran into a second-rank demon beast. If not for my Flame Tiger fighting desperately, this old man would've been done for."  

"A second-rank demon beast? I thought their presence here was just a rumor."  

"They're real, alright. One guy even got swallowed whole this time. What a pity for my Flame Tiger..."  

"Did it die?"  

"No, but it's badly injured. Might take a long time to recover, and I'll have to feed it some spirit herbs."  

"Well, surviving is already a blessing. Good thing you tamed that Flame Tiger earlier, or you'd be keeping that unlucky fellow company."  

"Hmph, you're right. Gains and losses go hand in hand."  

As they spoke, the last cultivator arrived at the valley entrance. Now, they only had to wait for Huang Fei to open the barrier.  

"The time's up. Why hasn't anyone from Canglong Valley opened the barrier yet?" someone complained.  

"Just wait a little longer. Complaining won't help, and you don't want them hearing you," another advised.  

Qin Chong glanced around and got an idea.  

He sent a voice transmission to Zhao Yin: "Brother Zhao, how about another trade while we wait?"  

"Again? What else do you have to trade?"  

"Not between us. There are nine others here."  

"You want to organize an exchange? Not a bad idea. Why don't you propose it?"  

"Ah, I'm just a nobody. Someone as esteemed and powerful as you would have more influence."  

"Fair point. A little brat like you wouldn't command much respect."  

The term "little brat" irked Qin Chong, but he couldn't refute it—at sixteen or seventeen, he did look the part.  

"Fellow Daoists, your attention, please!" Zhao Yin cleared his throat and called out loudly.  

The cultivators turned to look.  

"It's rare for so many of us to gather here. I propose a small exchange—everyone can trade for what they need. If interested, gather around. We don't have much time, so let's make it quick."  

At first, the crowd hesitated, but as two people stepped forward, the rest followed. A small trading session began.  

Half an hour later, everyone returned to their original spots.  

Qin Chong's biggest gain was offloading all the materials he had taken from Huo Yuanliang. He had also left the man's storage pouch on a giant tree in the Gourd Valley, easing his worries.  

Additionally, he acquired several beginner-level secret techniques—some for taming beasts, others for controlling insects, and even a few basic alchemy and artifact-forging manuals. All would be useful to him.  

Another half-hour passed before the barrier suddenly vanished, and the three Canglong Valley disciples reappeared.  

But something was off. Huang Fei, their leader, seemed unsteady, his aura erratic and his face pale, as if he had just been in a fierce battle.  

"Fellow Daoists, form two lines. Senior Brother Zhang and I will exchange your spirit herbs for spirit stones. Don't try anything—we'll be inspecting your storage pouches," Liu Hao announced.  

"What about the Lightning Binding Curses on us?" someone shouted.  

"Stay calm. Once Senior Brother Huang recovers his energy, he'll remove them one by one. Hurry up—we don't have much time. We must leave Great Cang Mountain before nightfall."  

At Liu Hao's words, the cultivators complied, stepping forward to exchange their herbs.  

As the first cultivator approached, Liu Hao and Zhang Kui each released a white Spirit-Seeking Mouse—no larger than a palm. When someone came forward, the mice would sniff vigorously.  

Spirit-Seeking Mice were typically bred by major sects. Though weak in cultivation, they were extremely sensitive to spiritual energy, their sense of smell surpassing even that of Spirit-Devouring Beasts.  

Disciples on herb-gathering missions often rented them from their sects—they were incredibly useful.  

When Qin Chong stepped forward, his heart pounded. He worried whether the creature could detect the Eight Trigrams Mirror inside him. Even the slightest risk of exposure was unacceptable.  

"Brother Qin, your harvest seems rather meager," Liu Hao remarked, noting the fewer herbs Qin Chong presented.  

"Ah, my cultivation is weak, and this is my first time leaving the family, so..."  

"No matter. You'll improve with more experience."  

Relieved, Qin Chong accepted the spirit stones and stepped away. The worst had been avoided.  

Once the exchanges concluded, Liu Hao summoned the Flying Dragon Boat. After everyone boarded, they departed Great Cang Mountain. Huang Fei remained on the boat, still recovering, though his complexion had improved.  

Only after leaving the mountain range did Huang Fei awaken from his meditation. One by one, he removed the Lightning Binding Curses from the cultivators.  

Qin Chong had assumed the boat would take them near Pingyang City, but as soon as they entered Little Cang Mountain, Liu Hao announced, "Fellow Daoists, this is where we part ways. My senior brothers and I have other tasks. We won't escort you further."  

The cultivators exchanged glances but had no grounds to object.  

Compared to Great Cang Mountain, Little Cang Mountain was far less dangerous. With their mid-to-late Qi Refining cultivation, everyone could protect themselves.  

One by one, they disembarked, summoning their flying swords to leave. Qin Chong, being the weakest, was the slowest and fell behind.  

Suddenly, Zhao Yin's voice whispered in his ear: "Kid, don't rush out of the mountains just yet. Find a place to hide for a while. Good luck."  

Before Qin Chong could reply, Zhao Yin had already flown out of transmission range. Slowing his flight, Qin Chong's expression darkened with unease.
