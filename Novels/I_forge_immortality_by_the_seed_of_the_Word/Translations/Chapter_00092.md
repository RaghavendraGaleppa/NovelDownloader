# Chapter 91: Twenty-Four Steps

"Senior Brother Zhang!"

As Zhang Jing approached, Chen Xiandao and Shen Qingqing called out in unison.

Their voices immediately drew the attention of surrounding outer courtyard disciples from other academies, all turning curious gazes toward Zhang Jing.

The disciples from Shenxiao and Xuanguang Academies looked on with simple curiosity.

But the outer courtyard disciples of Longhu Academy wore expressions mixed with hope and anxiety. Their academy's two top-grade talents had just failed to break into the Second Void Heaven. Zhang Jing had become their last hope.

Yet Senior Brother Zhang, like those two top-graders, had only been cultivating in the academy for a short time. If he failed too...

Then they, the disciples of Longhu Academy, would truly have no face left before the outer courtyard disciples of the other two academies.

The expressions on the Longhu disciples' faces only deepened the curiosity of the other academies' disciples. The man who had been compiling a list of outer courtyard geniuses paused his work to stare intently at Zhang Jing's approaching figure.

"May I ask who this senior brother is? Why do you all—"

"That's a secret for now," Shen Qingqing replied with a mischievous glint in her eyes.

"Brother Chen, Fairy Shen, have you two already attempted the Heavenly Staircase challenge?" Zhang Jing asked as he came to a stop, ignoring the dozens of varied gazes fixed upon him.

"Senior Brother Zhang, these spirit god projections are extremely powerful. You must be careful," Shen Qingqing said, her beautiful eyes filled with concern.

Clearly, she wasn't certain how far Zhang Jing could progress. She only hoped he could at least reach the Second Void Heaven.

"Senior Brother Zhang, you absolutely must not underestimate this challenge," Chen Xiandao added solemnly.

"Understood. Thank you both for the warning."

With a nod, Zhang Jing transformed into a streak of rainbow light and shot toward the first step.

The so-called "step" was actually a massive arena—a hundred zhang in length and width, forged from some indestructible-looking green-gold material covered in Dao patterns.

As the radiant light descended, Zhang Jing landed softly at the arena's center like a feather. His gaze swept across the surroundings, taking in the frozen shadows standing motionless around the arena's perimeter—some humanoid, but most were bizarre, unidentifiable shapes.

Just as he was observing...

Crack!

A stiff sound suddenly rang out.

Following the noise, Zhang Jing saw a nine-zhang-long winged tiger shadow slowly come to life, transforming into a vividly colored giant beast radiating formidable power.

Roar!

With a thunderous roar, the giant tiger beat its wings and leaped dozens of zhang into the air, descending upon Zhang Jing with murderous intent.

Seeing this, Zhang Jing actually felt relieved.

So it wasn't all the shadows attacking at once. That was good to know.

He looked up at the snarling beast—peak Qi Refining Tenth Level cultivation, a powerful physique, and utterly emotionless, a perfect killing machine. For most people, this would indeed be troublesome to deal with. No wonder these served as guardians of the Heavenly Staircase.

With a thought...

Ding! Ding!

The crisp sound of clashing metal echoed across the arena.

From the clear river water, three spell-fish leaped out, transforming into half-human-height blades of terrifying sharpness. Arranged in a triangular formation, they shot toward the tiger with cold, deadly light.

In an instant...

Tiny ice crystals drifted down like snow, covering the arena floor in an even layer of eerie crimson.

A flash of light appeared in Zhang Jing's palm.

Spiritual Essence +10!

Without pause, Zhang Jing transformed back into rainbow light and shot toward the second step.

The guardian spirit projection here was slightly stronger than the first, but still couldn't withstand his Three Methods Dao Seed version of the Frozen Blade Technique.

Spiritual Essence +10!

Time flowed steadily.

Third step. Fourth step. Fifth step...

Zhang Jing advanced like an unstoppable force. Apart from the few seconds spent observing the first step's arena, none of the subsequent steps even slowed him down for half a moment.

Ninth step.

Watching his three Frozen Blades shatter effortlessly against an armored man's defenses, Zhang Jing couldn't help showing surprise.

The guardian here wasn't just slightly stronger than the eighth step—it was on an entirely different level.

But that was all.

At least in Zhang Jing's estimation, its combat power hadn't completely surpassed the Qi Refining Tenth Level realm.

The next moment...

Whoosh—

The Five Treasures Spirit River surged violently, dozens of Frozen Blades raining down like a storm upon the armored figure.

This time, there were no surprises.

The armored man dissolved into a cloud of crimson mist.

Spiritual Essence +20!

"The next level should be the so-called Second Void Heaven," Zhang Jing murmured before transforming into light once more and vanishing upward.

Below...

Only when Zhang Jing's light had completely disappeared did the Longhu Academy outer courtyard disciples finally relax, bursting into cheers.

Heaven be praised!

Someone from their outer courtyard had finally entered the Second Void Heaven!

Meanwhile, Shen Qingqing and Chen Xiandao stood frozen in shock.

Especially Shen Qingqing.

Having been stopped at the ninth step herself, she knew exactly how terrifying its guardian was. Yet Zhang Jing had cleared it so quickly?

"The gap between us has grown too large," she thought bitterly. During the outer courtyard examination, she had ranked first while he was third. She was supposed to be the top-grade talent!

"You Longhu Academy folks really know how to hide your strength," remarked the man compiling the genius list, watching the name rapidly climbing the Spiritual Essence rankings with awe.

Second Void Heaven.

This time, it was an endless grassland.

After a brief glance, Zhang Jing immediately shot toward the next set of stairs.

First step.

Looking at the fallen guardian's corpse, Zhang Jing's expression turned serious.

He could clearly feel it—the guardians here had undergone a qualitative leap in strength, vaguely surpassing the Qi Refining Tenth Level.

This meant that in a few more steps, spells alone wouldn't be enough. He'd need to fully activate the Five Treasures Spirit River, and perhaps even employ the 60% comprehended Nether Python Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme.

"Come then, let's see my limits!"

A bright smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face as rainbow light carried him upward once more.

Meanwhile...

On the grasslands below, Qin Nian spotted the streak of light. Though he couldn't see who it was, his intuition told him it was Zhang Jing.

"I stopped at the seventh step of Second Void Heaven. I wonder if you can surpass me?"

Not far away, Xuanguang Academy's top-grade talent also noticed the light, confusion rising in his heart.

"Who is that?"

He'd confirmed Longhu Academy's two top-graders couldn't break into First Void Heaven anytime soon, and inner courtyard disciples had all advanced to higher voids long ago.

What sorcery was this?!

He hurriedly checked the Spiritual Essence rankings.

Soon after...

Staring at the monstrous guardian that was still charging toward him despite the boiling Five Treasures Spirit River infused with Nether Python Dao Rhyme, Zhang Jing let out a long breath.

This was his current limit.

To progress further would require deeper comprehension of Dao Rhyme.

Having realized this, Zhang Jing didn't stubbornly press on. He withdrew, descending slowly onto the icy plains below.

Third Void Heaven, sixth step!

His eyes flashed as he immediately checked the Spiritual Essence rankings:

[614: Zhang Jing (Qi Refining Tenth Level • 24 Steps • Longhu Academy)]

Ahead of him at the thirtieth step was an inner courtyard Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Behind him at the sixteenth step was an outer courtyard disciple named Qin Nian, followed by another at the twelfth step named Shen Xiao—apparently the top-grade talents of Shenxiao and Xuanguang Academies respectively.
