# Chapter 5: Qi Refinement Method

Receiving Gu Mo's affirmative answer, Yao Shifeng's smile widened. As a noble of the Great Xia Dynasty, he understood well that achieving great things required more than individual effort—especially for a mere outer sect disciple like himself.

Had he possessed a mid-grade or even high-grade spiritual root, the sect would have provided him ample resources for cultivation without needing to forge connections. Unfortunately, Yao Shifeng had only been assessed with the lowest-grade inferior spiritual root—an outcome he found unacceptable. In the mortal world, he had been an esteemed aristocrat, yet in the immortal cultivation world, he was relegated to the lowest rank of outer sect disciples. He refused to resign himself to this fate.

Thus, Yao Shifeng resolved to climb the ranks step by step. After all, there were precedents of outer sect disciples eventually becoming inner sect disciples. During his time in the scripture pavilion, he had studied cases of outer sect disciples who had risen unexpectedly. Combining this research with his current circumstances, he settled on forming connections with fellow disciples from his homeland.

In a private dining room, Yao Shifeng, Gu Mo, Hu Hai, Wu Jinfei, and Chu Feifei gathered around a table. After Gu Mo agreed to join, Yao Shifeng had invited everyone to dine together and get acquainted.

Through their conversation, Gu Mo formed a general impression of the other three besides Yao Shifeng. Hu Hai was a short, somewhat timid youth whose demeanor suggested an inferiority complex, likely tied to his humble origins. In contrast, Wu Jinfei was a burly, talkative young man whose spiritual energy assessment had placed him in the upper-middle range. Chu Feifei, the only woman in the group, was a striking fifteen- or sixteen-year-old with an already curvaceous figure—a fact that drew frequent glances from both Hu Hai and Wu Jinfei.

"Friends, I have some cultivation insights I'd like to share with you all," Yao Shifeng announced after their introductions. Forming this small group served his own purposes, and to reap benefits from it, initial investment was essential.

At the mention of cultivation insights, everyone's attention turned to him. At this stage, nothing was more important than cultivation—strength was everything. Although the sect would send Qi Refinement stage senior brothers to instruct them, those rote lectures couldn't compare to detailed personal insights.

"My family elder once joined the sect and left behind some cultivation notes," Yao Shifeng explained under their gazes. His family's noble status in Great Xia stemmed from that very elder. Though merely an outer sect disciple who had passed away over a century ago, the legacy left behind had maintained his family's aristocratic standing.

Among that legacy, the cultivation notes held significant value. With their help, Yao Shifeng had become one of the top performers among outer sect disciples. Unfortunately, his ancestor had been an ordinary outer sect disciple with no remaining sect connections after so many years, leaving Yao Shifeng no one to rely on.

Taking a deep breath, Yao Shifeng began sharing his family's cultivation insights. While these would be priceless treasures to rogue cultivators, their value diminished somewhat within the sect—yet they remained highly valuable to outer sect disciples.

"I see!" Gu Mo thought as he listened, finally gaining clear understanding of Qi Refinement stage cultivation. After initially drawing qi into the body, the next step involved continuously accumulating spiritual energy to open meridians and complete minor celestial cycles. Different techniques required opening varying numbers of meridians, but all Qi Refinement stage methods followed the same progression: nine minor cycles, three intermediate cycles, and one grand cycle.

Completing one minor cycle marked advancement to the first layer of Qi Refinement. Three minor cycles meant reaching the third layer, after which came the first bottleneck between early and middle stages—merging three minor cycles into one intermediate cycle to enter mid-stage Qi Refinement. Completing three intermediate cycles brought one to the ninth layer, and merging those into a grand cycle signified Great Perfection of Qi Refinement.

Noticing their thoughtful expressions, Yao Shifeng smiled faintly. By sharing these precious insights—only a portion of what he possessed—he had solidified this group's cohesion. He would gradually reveal more in the future.

As Yao Shifeng concluded, the group expressed their gratitude. "Our current task is rapid cultivation progress. Let's meet again in a week to discuss any issues," he said, waving them off.

"That Yao Shifeng is no simple man," Gu Mo mused back in his quarters, reflecting on the other's performance. Not that it mattered—Yao Shifeng had shared valuable knowledge, and Gu Mo didn't mind reciprocating in kind.

Retrieving the Sunflower from his black mist space, Gu Mo noted the evening sky. Having kept it stored all day, the plant bore no solar essence, confirming it couldn't accumulate the energy while in that space—it needed exposure to sunlight.

"Time to cultivate," Gu Mo murmured, studying the sect-provided Qi Gathering Technique manual. Immersed in cultivation, the week passed swiftly.

By their next gathering, Gu Mo had made remarkable progress—all thanks to the Sunflower. A single portion of solar essence equaled two days of his arduous cultivation (defined as over eight hours daily). Moreover, the essence could be absorbed in mere breaths.

In simpler terms, Gu Mo's cultivation speed that week matched that of a low-grade spiritual root cultivator. If an inferior root's speed was 1, a low-grade root ranged from 2-4 (varying between individuals). Mid-grade roots reached 5-7 times faster, and high-grade up to 10 times—before accounting for additional boosts from superior techniques, spiritual lands, or elixirs.

The Sunflower's essence had effectively altered Gu Mo's spiritual root quality—an astonishing effect proving its immense value. Moreover, that week Gu Mo had discovered additional uses for the solar essence.
