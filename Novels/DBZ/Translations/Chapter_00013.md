# Chapter 13: Soulshaking Mountain  

The next day finally arrived—the official start of the auction.  

Early in the morning, a medium-sized flying vessel, nearly eighty zhang in length, tore through the clouds and descended from the sky.  

Judging by the flowing cloud patterns painted on the vessel, everyone immediately knew who had arrived.  

A red-robed elder flew out from the stone hall and respectfully greeted them.  

"Fellow Daoists Chen and Shi, it's been a while," the red-robed elder said with a hearty laugh.  

Two figures descended from the flying vessel first, both exuding the aura of Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

"As expected of the Liuyun Sect, a Golden Core-level force governing a hundred-thousand-mile radius. They can casually dispatch two Foundation Establishment experts," Wei Qian mused.  

The cultivation world of Zhao Country was divided into five major regions: Yangzhou, Linzhou, Louzhou, Daizhou, and Yunzhou.  

The Liuyun Sect was the most powerful faction in Yunzhou.  

The reason it wasn't called the sole ruler of Yunzhou was because there was another formidable force in the region—a great cultivation clan capable of rivaling sect powers: the Alchemy Cauldron Xiao Clan!  

Wei Qian shifted his gaze to another part of the horizon, where another medium-sized flying vessel was descending. This one bore the image of an ancient bronze cauldron.  

A flag fluttered atop the vessel, emblazoned with a large character: "Xiao!"  

This time, it was the Li Clan members beside Wei Qian who stared in awe at the Xiao Clan's procession.  

Wei Qian understood their fascination. For clan cultivators like them, a grand family like the Alchemy Cauldron Xiao Clan was undoubtedly the object of their deepest envy.  

"Look at that person!" Li Guchen suddenly spoke up, his gaze fixed on a young man descending from the Xiao Clan's vessel.  

"Isn't that the Xiao Clan's young master, Xiao Yuan?"  

Xiao Yuan? Who was that?  

When it came to higher-level information, Wei Qian was completely in the dark. After all, as a rogue cultivator, his knowledge was far inferior to these clan cultivators.  

*If I get the chance, I must find something like a library and thoroughly study this kind of information,* Wei Qian thought to himself.  

Li Wanhai narrowed his eyes slightly before saying, "It is Xiao Yuan. Four years ago, I saw him once in Blackscale Immortal City. Back then, he was only at the sixth level of Qi Refinement. Now, he’s at the Great Perfection stage!"  

Even Li Wanhai himself seemed surprised by his own words.  

But the next moment, he shook his head and sighed with a bitter smile. "Well, with his superior spiritual root talent and status as the Xiao Clan’s young master, it’d be strange if he *didn’t* achieve this."  

"Alright, the auction organizers have arrived. Let’s tidy up and head in."  

---  

This auction was an opportunity for the Li Clan to both sell items and potentially acquire treasures.  

Li Wanhai selected a few people—Li Caiwei, Li Guchen, and others—to accompany him.  

The remaining twelve, including Wei Qian, stayed behind.  

"Guard the camp while I’m gone," Li Wanhai instructed before entering the auction. "No trouble while I’m away."  

"Yes!" the twelve responded in unison.  

Watching Li Wanhai lead the seven toward the auction hall, Wei Qian felt no resentment.  

*The outside world may be fascinating, but I don’t yet have the strength to fully explore it.*  

*I just hope this auction ends smoothly without any complications.*  

He found himself missing the simple routine of working, meditating, and cultivating on Mist Ridge Mountain.  

With that thought, he turned to the remaining eleven and said, "I’ll be in my tent. Call me if anything happens."  

Returning to his tent, he sat down and began meditating.  

Though the spiritual energy here far surpassed the mortal world, it was still much thinner compared to the mid-grade spiritual vein on Mist Ridge Mountain.  

Wei Qian’s actions were more out of habit than necessity.  

After meditating for about two hours, his ears twitched at the growing commotion outside.  

He opened his eyes.  

Stepping out of the tent, he frowned in confusion. The area outside the auction was bustling with excitement. Many rogue cultivators were in a frenzy, and he spotted dozens of streaks of light darting across the sky—Qi Refinement cultivators flying on their artifacts.  

"What’s going on?" Wei Qian asked one of the Li Clan members on guard.  

The man was visibly excited, his eyes burning with fervor. "This auction has something huge! The Alchemy Cauldron Xiao Clan just put up *three* Foundation Establishment Pills for sale!"  

"Now, all the cultivation clans and wealthy rogue cultivators are scrambling to gather spirit stones!"  

*Foundation Establishment Pills!*  

Wei Qian was no stranger to their reputation. These were divine pills that increased a Qi Refinement cultivator’s chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment!  

Even if the breakthrough failed, consuming one could still preserve the cultivator’s life.  

When these pills were first created forty thousand years ago, they were hailed as the "Greatest Pills of All Time!"  

As the world’s spiritual energy gradually waned compared to ancient eras, the importance of Foundation Establishment Pills only grew.  

But the number of pills available was pitifully small compared to the demand.  

"Scarce as hen’s teeth" was the perfect description.  

Many cultivation clans had wealth enough to buy two or three pills—yet often found none available.  

So when the Xiao Clan suddenly released three Foundation Establishment Pills at this auction, the frenzy was inevitable.  

Instead of excitement, Wei Qian felt a deep sense of foreboding.  

*This is trouble! Three Foundation Establishment Pills up for auction? Once it ends, this place will turn into a battlefield!*  

Were all those flying cultivators truly just gathering spirit stones? How many were secretly plotting to *steal* the pills if they couldn’t buy them?  

Wei Qian was certain that some ancient, near-death Foundation Establishment experts were already rushing here.  

Given enough time, even the Li Clan’s ancestor from Mist Ridge Mountain might show up.  

After all, securing just *one* Foundation Establishment Pill could ensure the Li Clan’s prosperity for another two centuries!  

As Wei Qian pondered the situation, Li Wanhai and his group unexpectedly returned from the auction.  

Upon reaching the camp, Li Wanhai’s expression was grave. "Gather everyone. We’re packing up and leaving *now*."  

Wei Qian was overjoyed.  

*That’s exactly what I wanted to hear.*  

Li Guchen hesitated. "Uncle, shouldn’t we stay and try our luck?"  

"Foolish!" Li Wanhai snapped—while Wei Qian mentally echoed the sentiment.  

"With Foundation Establishment Pills in play, the moment the auction ends, there’ll be a bloodbath," Wei Qian explained. "The longer we stay, the greater the danger. If we don’t leave now, we might not get another chance."  

Li Wanhai nodded approvingly. "Exactly."  

Though he had briefly entertained the idea of staying, he ultimately suppressed his greed. He had even withdrawn their auction items to ensure a swift departure.  

But the worst-case scenario unfolded.  

The sky darkened abruptly. An overwhelming pressure descended from the heavens.  

A shrill, ghostly voice cackled:  

*"How could you hold a demon-slaying auction without inviting the Seven Demon Sects?"*  

*"This old man—Soulshaking Mountain’s Impermanence True Monarch—has come to join the fun!"*
