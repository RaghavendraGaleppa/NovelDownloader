# Chapter 159: Transaction

Upon speaking, he pulled out a scroll from his embrace. It looked incredibly ordinary, seemingly made only of white cloth. When unrolled, there were no patterns inside, exceptionally plain. Yet, a profound fluctuation resonated in the air, as if connecting to some unknown place.

The scroll floated, emitting light. Then, a gate of light opened in the void, and the Sacred God Lord stepped into it, with the Lord of Death and the Lord of Thunder following closely behind. The light gate closed, leaving only one sentence echoing in the air:

"When we return again, we shall turn the world upside down!"

The divine kingdom's holy spirits below also dissipated, and the portal connecting to the divine kingdom closed.

Yan Mo was somewhat stunned, wondering why the Sacred God Lord and the others had left in such a hurry. If the stalemate had continued, with the divine kingdom as a backing, the final outcome would have been uncertain. Moreover, their method of leaving was very strange; they didn't leave through the divine kingdom, but used a secret art.

Boom!

A moment later, a massive roar came from the sky. Everyone looked up to see a corner of a colossal city squeezing out from the void. Its mottled stone walls, adorned with golden flowing bloodstains, showcased an immense grandeur and magnificence.

"This is... Heaven Pass."

Yan Mo's brows relaxed. So that was it. Although he didn't know what had been blocking Heaven Pass all this time, the Sacred God Lord and the others had clearly received news that Heaven Pass had broken through its restrictions, which was why they left in such a rush. With his mind relaxed, the pent-up vital energy in Yan Mo's body gave way. His vision blurred, and he fainted.

One day later, a naked figure suddenly appeared in the void – it was Zhou Tian, freshly resurrected.

"I knew it!"

Before he could even react, a colossal hand radiating brilliant light grasped him. Space shifted, and he reappeared in an unknown location. Those left behind to clean the battlefield looked up strangely, only able to vaguely perceive spatial storms permeating the void, indicating that the spatial barrier here was already incredibly thin.

This place was surrounded by forests, with thick trees dozens of feet tall. The air was fresh, indicating they were far from the apocalyptic battlefield of Mount Myriad Gods.

After seeing who stood before him, Zhou Tian's eyelids couldn't help but twitch.

"Senior Saint Demon, what is the meaning of this?"

Standing before him was none other than Saint Demon, currently in his Saint form, clad in white robes, elegant and refined as jade, a smile gracing his face. "Peak Physique? Heavenly Venerate methods? Impressive, truly impressive. To think I, Saint Demon, who has traversed the world for ten thousand years, was actually deceived by a mere greenhorn."

"Senior Saint Demon, what are you talking about?" Zhou Tian had a bad premonition; it seemed he had been exposed.

"Stop feigning, kid. You were favored by a Heavenly Venerate; how could Zhou Changsheng not know?"

"That's because..." Zhou Tian's mind raced, trying to come up with a plausible lie.

"Don't bother with excuses. No Heavenly Venerate can directly create a Half-step Heavenly Venerate." Saint Demon interrupted Zhou Tian's attempt to speak. At that realm, every life form is unique. Perhaps a Heavenly Venerate could directly create a Heavenly King, or even a Dao Lord, but anything related to a Heavenly Venerate themselves is absolutely impossible. This was Zhou Tian's biggest loophole.

"Since you know I have a way to reach Half-step Heavenly Venerate strength, and you still dare to come find me, aren't you afraid I'll crush you?" Zhou Tian sneered, wanting to roll up his sleeves, only to realize he was still naked and had no sleeves to roll. He awkwardly rubbed his arm instead.

"I know you are very special and have your own trump cards, but you probably can't use them easily, can you? In this period, you've used that method a total of three times: once against me, once against that kid from Grand Luo Academy, and once against the God-King. And coincidentally, the strength you displayed each time was the strongest present. How interesting. What kind of method is this?" Saint Demon waved his hand, and a simple plain robe appeared on Zhou Tian's body, as he spoke casually.

'Old hooligan, bah, spying on me!' Zhou Tian cursed inwardly, feeling a headache from the schemes of these old monsters. Saint Demon had probably suspected him that day and had been secretly observing him ever since.

Before Zhou Tian could speak, Saint Demon pointed a finger, and a ray of colorful light floated out. Zhou Tian instantly transformed into a small pixie, his wings fluttering behind him. A moment later, Saint Demon acted again, and Zhou Tian returned to normal.

"You really can't use that method right now. Interesting. What exactly is the price?" Although Saint Demon seemed to be asking, he was actually just muttering to himself. He knew Zhou Tian wouldn't answer him.

"Did you just turn me into one of those little trinkets?" Zhou Tian pointed at the pixies fluttering around Saint Demon. He had just felt his consciousness enter an inexplicable space, chained up, and then observed everything from a peculiar and eerie perspective.

"Indeed." Saint Demon nodded.

"Can you turn me back... Bah! A warrior can be killed but not humiliated!" Zhou Tian roared indignantly, then vanished from the spot, escaping with teleportation.

Saint Demon shook his head and smiled, taking a single step and instantly catching up to Zhou Tian.

"I can cross ten thousand li in a single step. Do you want to compete with me in speed?" Saint Demon said calmly, following closely beside Zhou Tian. Each time, he took only a gentle step, yet he always kept up with Zhou Tian.

"What exactly do you want from me?" Zhou Tian stopped and gave up on running. He had already guessed he couldn't outrun Saint Demon, but he had to try. Now, seeing the situation, it seemed he truly couldn't escape. He had already used up his revival count for today, so he couldn't use the Cultivation Replication skill again. But as long as he got through today, everything would be fine, and he would have bargaining chips. And judging by Saint Demon's intentions, he wasn't planning to settle scores.

"I wish to complete a transaction with you," Saint Demon stopped as well, his hair radiant, his body gleaming, and spoke.

"Transaction? What transaction?" Zhou Tian was slightly surprised, not expecting Saint Demon to use such a refined term.

"You come with me to a place and help me retrieve something." Saint Demon stated simply.

"Senior, if it's something you can't even obtain, how could I possibly get it?" Zhou Tian said with a bitter expression.

"No, you are very special, with unique methods. I have great confidence that you can obtain it." Saint Demon shook his head, his gaze fixed on Zhou Tian, a mysterious light flickering in his eyes.

"What if I don't agree?" Zhou Tian tried asking.

Saint Demon smiled faintly, and two words popped out of his mouth:

"Guess."

'I'll guess your ****,' Zhou Tian cursed inwardly, pondering for a long time. This old man was not simple, and now he knew quite a bit about him. Zhou Tian wasn't afraid of Saint Demon turning him into a pixie again; he could still perceive the outside world in that form, and then he could use his [Cultivation Replication] skill, targeting Saint Demon, to recover. Saint Demon didn't know the activation conditions for his skill, so there was no need to worry about him blocking that path.
