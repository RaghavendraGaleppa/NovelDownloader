# Chapter 130: The Grand Array Breaks, Demonic Sect Arrives, Trapped in Ghost Mist

"Spiritual Resonance burst! Use your artifacts to defend!"

Almost simultaneously with the sudden eruption of flowing light, an urgent roar echoed across the mountain peak. It was none other than the cultivator surnamed Yan.

Chu Ning, with his hand pressed against the Dharma Power pillar, was already prepared. Almost immediately, the three mid-grade, mid-tier defensive talismans he held were simultaneously activated. Activating three such talismans at once was already the limit of what he could do. At the same time, the Dharma Power in his left hand poured into the Earth Spirit Bracelet, activating this defensive artifact, which was comparable to half a top-tier artifact. Chu Ning instantly deployed his strongest defensive measures.

The others also mostly activated their defensive artifacts without delay. At this moment, the scattered green glows, flying back at an even more furious pace, struck the various cultivators on the mountain peak.

"Tss!!!"

"Ah!!" "No!"

Accompanied by the sounds of defensive shields shattering, screams rang out one after another.

At this moment, five or six rays of green light shot towards the shield in front of Chu Ning. Their speed was unprecedented. The outermost layer, a mid-grade, mid-tier defensive talisman, offered almost no resistance and was shattered instantly. The second mid-grade, mid-tier defensive talisman met the same fate. Then, the rays slammed into the third layer.

The third light shield resisted for a brief moment but did not hold out long before breaking once more. However, this bought Chu Ning some time, and three more mid-grade talismans appeared in his hand. Without any hesitation, Chu Ning activated them. He no longer cared about the stone pillar at this point and withdrew his hand, ready to retrieve more talismans from his storage bag.

But at that very moment, a stream of green light, following the stone pillar, directly struck Chu Ning's palm. Then, it flashed and vanished, sinking into his palm. Chu Ning was startled. However, the next moment, feeling no abnormality, Chu Ning dismissed further thoughts and swiftly retrieved three more talismans, holding them ready. Because at the same time, the green light that had pierced through three layers of mid-grade, mid-tier defensive talismans had heavily struck the yellow light shield of the Earth Spirit Bracelet.

The yellow light of the defensive shield glowed brightly, but the next moment, it completely shattered. However, at the same time, the incoming rays of green light also shattered and disappeared. Chu Ning, still within the light shields of the three mid-grade, mid-tier defensive talismans, was safe for now, but his expression was extremely grim. The talismans in his hand were ready for immediate activation. Because at this moment, the subsequent sparse rays of green light were still scattering, though fortunately, none struck his defensive shield again.

Only now did the sky full of green light and flowing light vanish, signaling that the Spiritual Resonance burst seemed to have ended.

"With such explosive power, can even half of the disciples here survive?"

As Chu Ning's heart tightened, he looked around and then fell silent. Among the original two hundred people on this mountain peak, there were now fewer than 10 figures remaining. This number included the cultivators surnamed Yan and Liu. The rest, like Wang Weizhong next to Chu Ning, and Zhuang Yunde and Luo Hongping whom he knew, had all vanished. Moreover, even their artifacts, storage bags, and other belongings had completely disappeared. It was as if these people had never appeared on this mountain peak.

Chu Ning's heart sank into an icy abyss. This scene was like those people had been teleported somewhere, and if Chu Ning hadn't just seen Wang Weizhong vanish into thin air before his eyes, perhaps he would have thought so too. But at this moment, he knew that these people had been utterly annihilated by the impact of those flowing lights, leaving no bones behind.

"The Wooden Spirit Seed was blocked, but no, the grand array can't hold..."

Before Chu Ning could ponder further, he heard another cry of alarm. Looking up, he saw the green light mass of the seed currently being blocked in mid-air by a five-colored light barrier.

"This Five Elements Qiankun Array, besides gathering Dharma Power, actually has such strong defensive capabilities."

Chu Ning looked at the sky with some surprise. The five-colored light shield blocking the Wooden Spirit Seed in the air was clearly connected to all their mountain peaks. It was indeed a manifestation of the Five Elements Qiankun Array. No disciples were casting spells now, but the array's defense had opened, clearly a pre-arranged measure. However, the five-colored light shield was visibly thinning at a rapid rate. The Wooden Spirit Seed had already breached a small portion of the shield; at this rate, the shield would be broken within a few breaths.

As Chu Ning and the others looked up, everyone inside and outside the spirit realm was also watching the scene in the sky. However, what they saw was not the same as what Chu Ning and the others witnessed. In the residential area with numerous buildings, disciples of different attributes were looking up at the sky. In their eyes, above the sky where the Five Elements Qiankun Array was set up, green light flickered. The flowing light shot straight into the sky. The next moment, the entire sky seemed to be illuminated by green light.

Then, everyone discovered that the spiritual energy of the entire world surged wildly towards the sky at a visible speed. The dense spiritual energy even transformed into white clouds, drifting in the air. This resonated with the soaring green light, forming a heaven-and-earth anomaly that enveloped all directions.

At the same time, under the gaze of Chu Ning and the others within the Five Elements Qiankun Array, the green light mass transformed from the Wooden Spirit Seed directly broke through the array's light shield and shot into the clouds. The next moment, invisible light waves rippled across the sky. Like the shifting of stars, everyone felt a blur before their eyes, and the scene before them changed. Both Chu Ning within the Five Elements Qiankun Array and the disciples of other attributes outside the array were all instantly teleported out of the spirit realm.

Their location was precisely where the five Golden Core elders of Qingxi Sect resided. The five Golden Core cultivators seated on stones were all profoundly skilled in Dharma Power, and their perception of the outside world was naturally extremely keen. As soon as the spirit realm's restrictions behind them showed even a slight reaction, all of them stood up. But before they could react, figures were directly teleported out. However, the five elders' gazes did not fall on Chu Ning and the others. Their eyes were cast afar, hundreds of miles away, where a green light shot into the sky. Even from hundreds of miles away, everyone could see it.

When the five elders saw the direction of the green light, they were slightly stunned. Because that direction was exactly where Qingxi Sect was located. The place where this Wooden Spirit Seed appeared was actually extremely close to Qingxi Sect! This was something none of the Golden Core elders had anticipated. Immediately, their expressions changed several times. Visible from hundreds of miles away, many disciples within Qingxi Sect were naturally drawn by the soaring green light. In the inner sect of Qingxi Sect, a small number of people, upon seeing this phenomenon, immediately showed incredibly complex expressions and cried out in alarm.

"Spirit Seed!"

Just as the green light, transformed from the Wooden Spirit Seed, was about to tear through the sky, a figure suddenly appeared in the air. Immediately, this person lightly raised their right hand, and a large white hand, formed by Dharma Power, fiercely grabbed downwards. It instantly seized the Wooden Spirit Seed, which was attempting to escape.

"Sect Master!"

The people within the sect cried out in surprise upon seeing the figure in the sky. This person was none other than Qingxi Sect Master, Xin Wuya. He had apparently already known the direction of the Spirit Seed and had appeared the moment the Wooden Spirit Seed burst out of the spirit realm.

Just as Xin Wuya was about to seize the Wooden Spirit Seed, hundreds of miles away, at Chu Ning's location, a deep shout suddenly erupted.

"Audacious!"

The usually taciturn Elder Yang in green robes suddenly let out a low roar. Immediately, he flicked his finger, and a spell shot out, hitting a Qi Condensation Completion disciple not far from Chu Ning. This Qi Condensation Completion disciple was instantly pierced by the spell, collapsing to the ground without any resistance. At the same time, a palm-sized talisman slipped from his hand.

"Positioning Talisman?"

Chu Ning was extremely familiar with various talismans. He only took a glance and recognized it as a basic, low-grade Positioning Talisman. Could it be someone from the Yin Demon Sect? A trace of doubt flashed in Chu Ning's mind.

"Humph!"

At this moment, the other Golden Core elders also took action. Several more disciples fell to the ground; they were all among those who had come later and helped activate the array with Chu Ning, numbering four or five people. But the next moment, the expressions of the Golden Core cultivators changed. One person, as he fell, surprisingly wore a smile on his face. And the runes on the Positioning Talisman in his hand flickered, clearly having been activated.

"Hehehe! Good, it's a pity your Qingxi Sect didn't act like a coward and hide, you really concealed yourselves well!"

Accompanying this voice, several black shadows suddenly appeared in the sky above everyone. However, these black shadows showed no intention of stopping, instead rapidly shooting towards the distance.

"Don't even think about it!"

Seeing this, the five Golden Core elders below rose into the sky one after another. At the same time, their artifacts shot out, blocking the several black shadows in the air. Each elder blocked a different Golden Core expert from the Yin Demon Sect, and coincidentally, there were exactly five of them.

Elder Yang, in green robes, who was at the forefront, faced a disheveled old man holding a ghost-head staff. Elder Zhu, with a dark face, who was at the very back, faced a skinny old man holding a Soul Summoning Banner. The other three Golden Core elders each confronted the remaining three Golden Core cultivators. The Yin Demon Sect's Golden Core cultivators also took action one after another, and various lights instantly intertwined in the air. A terrifying pressure immediately enveloped the entire sky.

"Not good!"

Watching this scene, Chu Ning furiously activated his Startling Thunder Steps, intending to flee into the distance. With so many Golden Core cultivators battling, even a slight aftershock would be enough to kill everyone.

"You insolent brat!"

At this moment, the dark-faced Elder Zhu in the air let out a furious roar. The next moment, the sky above Chu Ning and the others suddenly darkened. It was the skinny, black-robed old man fighting Elder Zhu who had thrown his Soul Summoning Banner down towards the crowd below.

Immediately, accompanied by gusts of sinister wind, countless black shadows assailed Chu Ning and the others on the ground. Instantly, everyone was enveloped in a black mist.

"What's happening?"

"Ah, I can't see."

"Everyone be careful."

"There are ghosts!"

Chu Ning first heard the shouts of the Qingxi Sect disciples around him. The next moment, cries of ghosts, some sharp and mournful, others sorrowful and resentful, reached Chu Ning's ears.

"Yin souls?"

Chu Ning, who instantly made a judgment, quickly took out two beads from his storage bag. One was the Green Light Pearl given by the sect before entering the spirit realm, and the other was none other than the Soul Stabilizing Pearl he had bought for a full ten thousand low-grade spirit stones from Yunhai Pavilion in Fengxia Market.

Even though Chu Ning knew little about the Dao of Ghosts, he naturally dared not easily release his spiritual sense in a place with so many Yin souls. With the Green Light Pearl and Soul Stabilizing Pearl in hand, Chu Ning's expression changed slightly when he saw the scene around him. Thousands upon thousands of Yin souls and ghost shadows filled the surroundings. These ghost shadows lunged at the Qi Condensation disciples.

Immediately, some disciples who were pounced upon had vacant eyes and remained motionless. Some had flickering eyes, radiating chilling Yin energy, while others became delirious and began attacking other disciples nearby. Chu Ning could also see these ghost shadows rushing towards him. They could even directly break through the light shield of the Green Light Pearl.

However, as they approached him, they were directly bounced away by an invisible wall. This, of course, was the effect of the Soul Stabilizing Pearl. Seeing this, Chu Ning's expression changed slightly, but his heart settled down a bit. This Soul Stabilizing Pearl could resist Yin soul attacks from entities below the strength of a Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator. If Yin souls were to reach Foundation Establishment late-stage, their strength in life would likely have to be Golden Core stage. The levels of these Yin souls and ghost entities should not be that high.

However, the next moment, his expression turned exceptionally grim, and he quickly dodged. A Qingxi Sect disciple at Qi Condensation eighth layer, with bloodshot eyes, was charging at him with an artifact.

"Senior Brother, wake up!" Chu Ning sharply shouted, attempting to awaken the disciple.

But this Qi Condensation eighth-layer disciple, whose nature had been lost due to the ghost entity, remained unmoved. Seeing Chu Ning dodging, he actually launched another spell attack. Chu Ning sighed inwardly and could only helplessly raise his hand, sending out a True Talisman spell from his talisman ring. The True Talisman spell, transformed from a Blazing Fire Talisman, shot towards the opponent. This person had no idea how to defend and continued to charge forward with a crazed expression.

"Tss!"

The fire light directly struck the disciple. Without any spell defense, his body was directly pierced by the True Talisman spell. Chu Ning silently watched the other party fall, and then a ghost shadow lunged towards him. With a thought, Chu Ning raised his hand and sent out another True Talisman spell, also transformed from a Blazing Fire Talisman. This time, it struck the ghost shadow in the air.

"Ah!"

In the air, the ghost shadow, struck by the spell, let out a piercing scream. However, it did not dissipate; instead, it lunged at Chu Ning even more frantically.

"These ordinary spells might cause some damage to these Yin souls and ghost entities, but it's difficult to eradicate them." Chu Ning sighed inwardly, then watched as the ghost entity, upon reaching him, was again bounced away by the invisible shield of the Soul Stabilizing Pearl.

At this moment, Chu Ning no longer cared about eradicating ghosts. He used his Startling Thunder Steps and quickly moved in one direction. Staying in this ghost mist was too passive; it was better to leave as soon as possible. But after running for a distance, Chu Ning's heart suddenly sank.

This ghost mist seemed to have some kind of array restriction; no matter how Chu Ning moved, it was as if he was just circling around, unable to leave the ghost mist. Chu Ning could only slowly move towards a corner, constantly dodging other disciples. However, occasionally, there were unavoidable situations, and Chu Ning could only reluctantly take action.

After a while, Chu Ning's eyes suddenly lit up. Not far away, Mu Ling was holding an artifact shaped like a jade ruyi. The jade ruyi emitted a soft yellow light that enveloped her, and the Yin souls and ghost entities seemed extremely afraid, avoiding her one after another.

Seeing this, Chu Ning immediately quickened his pace towards Mu Ling. Mu Ling, who was holding the jade ruyi and vigilantly watching her surroundings, saw someone quickly approaching her. Her face instantly became alert, and she picked up a talisman, ready to activate it.

"Senior Sister Mu, it's me, Chu Ning." Chu Ning quickly spoke.

"Junior Brother Chu?" Mu Ling also saw Chu Ning at this moment and was quite surprised to see him completely unharmed and clear-headed. However, seeing Chu Ning also holding something, she vaguely guessed that Chu Ning might also possess a treasure. Although both had questions, they had no intention of conversing at this moment.

However, after they converged, they both felt much more at ease. Both of them could resist the Yin souls and ghost entities, and if other Qingxi Sect disciples attacked, they could work together to fight them off. Gradually, this corner became incredibly safe. But not far from them, the scenes of Qingxi Sect disciples killing each other caused a hint of unbearable pain in Mu Ling's eyes. She couldn't help but voice her confusion:

"Are the sect's Golden Core elders completely unable to free themselves? Are these thousands of Qi Condensation disciples just left to fend for themselves?"

Hearing Mu Ling's words, Chu Ning shook his head. In fact, he had already been cursing inwardly for a long time. However, enveloped by the ghost mist, they naturally didn't know that the situation outside had already drastically changed.

When the dark-faced Elder Zhu saw the Yin Demon Sect's skinny elder take out and throw down the Soul Summoning Banner, he roared and took out his own artifact, preparing to block. But the next moment, his pupils suddenly widened. His gaze towards the front was filled with unconcealed shock. He saw that the chubby Elder Xie of Qingxi Sect was not fighting the white-haired elder from the Yin Demon Sect he was originally blocking.

Instead, both of them simultaneously attacked Elder Gui, the red-robed elder who was currently fighting another Golden Core cultivator. Elder Gui also noticed the anomaly at this moment. His丹炉 (danlu, alchemy cauldron) suddenly enlarged, enveloped in crimson flames, and he himself flashed and disappeared into the cauldron. The next moment, the attacks from the two Yin Demon Sect cultivators and the chubby Elder Xie simultaneously struck the cauldron.

"Bang!"

Accompanied by a heaven-shattering roar, the cauldron directly exploded, and flames splattered everywhere.
