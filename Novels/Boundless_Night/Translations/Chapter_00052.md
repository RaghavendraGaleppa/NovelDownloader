Chapter 52: It's Really Here

Qin Ming was astonished. Was this blade manual truly going to exceed his expectations and continuously surprise him?

The elder's blade technique was already astonishing enough, allowing him to witness a very profound artistic conception of the blade dao. However, his Heavenly Radiance Force had only recently achieved initial success, and he was still unable to fully unleash the power of that strongest strike.

Now, he hadn't even begun practicing the elder's Heavenly Radiance Force, yet this "Tathagata Force" was reacting?

Soon, Qin Ming shook his head again. He shouldn't harbor such high expectations. If someone had truly cultivated the Tathagata Force, they probably wouldn't even deign to look at this blade manual.

The Sky-Propping Force, Tathagata Force, and others were all stronger than even the Gigantic Spirit God Force, belonging to legendary force techniques. One must know that the latter's goal was to achieve godhood, already making it extremely powerful.

After considering these points, Qin Ming had already made a judgment: the legendary Heavenly Radiance Force could not possibly appear in this book.

His mind began to fully immerse itself in the book, engaging in immersive reading and resonating with the emotions within.

The more focused he became, the more concentrated his spirit, the clearer those sounds and images grew.

Qin Ming first looked at the section on "Tathagata Force." A single phrase contained such intense emotional fluctuation, revealing the deep obsession of the person who left the notes.

Before him, a burly, bearded man appeared, carrying a broad blade on his back, sighing as he gazed up at the night sky during a thunderstorm.

Finally, he even shouted, "Tathagata Force, I'll train your damn Nail Force!"

What was this situation? Qin Ming was startled, almost losing focus again and exiting the resonant state because of that remark.

A moment later, he understood. The burly, bearded man, following clues and enduring many hardships, finally discovered the secret treasure left by his predecessors and obtained a few pages of paper.

The opening was very deceptive. The first paragraph informed any later cultivators that this secret technique was related to the Tathagata Force!

However, as the man read carefully, excitedly flipping to the last page, he almost tore the papers. The last line read: "This is a Nail Force with extremely strong penetrating power."

The original owner of the papers had very earnestly informed future generations that the Nail Force was absolutely a component within the combination of the Tathagata Force.

Qin Ming was also speechless for a moment, understanding the burly man's feelings.

In fact, any foundational secret art of a sect is composed of many force techniques combined, ultimately merging to form the rare Heavenly Radiance Force.

Not to mention those legendary force techniques.

Everyone knew that the "true transmission on a single page" of the Tathagata Force would surely be densely covered with various force techniques.

Qin Ming sighed, no wonder the burly man's message contained a word of "hate." He was probably dumbfounded and bitter back then, as he had exhausted all his effort in pursuing those papers.

Subsequently, Qin Ming began to follow and learn.

Despite all his curses, the man still studied this force technique, practicing it with intense indignation, feeling as if he had been tricked.

As Qin Ming resonated with him, he was influenced, almost letting anger flare up as well.

Initially, he tried to suppress it, but later discovered that the more he allowed himself to get angry, the stronger the spiritual resonance became, and the clearer the insights.

Immediately, he completely let go!

When he closed the book, he was still muttering, "I'll train your damn Nail Force!"

Qin Ming closed his eyes, spending a full quarter of an hour to calm himself before finally shaking off that emotion.

He went into the courtyard and began to practice seriously. It was incredibly smooth, without any sense of stagnation, as if he had been studying it for most of his life.

The Heavenly Radiance Force within Qin Ming flowed rapidly, a sharp light emerging from his fingertips as the Nail Force gradually took shape.

He echoed the emotions of his predecessors, as if he had personally experienced those events. Their insights and experiences were firmly grasped by him, transforming into his own "resources."

However, this did not mean that his Nail Force had accumulated decades of "cultivation."

Because he had only witnessed those things and resonated with those insights and experiences, not directly gained power. He still had to practice it himself.

In a sense, this emotional resonance holds the greatest value and effect when dealing with various "techniques," such as studying blade manuals, spear arts, or sword scriptures. It allows for rapid and efficient mastery, with a single moment of enlightenment making it seem as if one had practiced for decades.

However, the elevation of his life level, such as Qin Ming's transition from second rebirth to third rebirth, and the accumulation of total Heavenly Radiance Force, still required him to accumulate it himself.

In those latter areas, he could not achieve success overnight.

"Even so, it's enough! After all, some force techniques are extremely difficult to practice and not easily comprehended," Qin Ming said, feeling very satisfied. Holding the crystallization of his predecessors' painstaking efforts, and achieving spiritual resonance with it, brought him immense gains.

He studied it carefully, concluding that this Nail Force was quite formidable. Although its name wasn't very pleasant, it was extremely useful in actual combat.

With Qin Ming's own comprehension, practicing the Nail Force wouldn't be difficult. But with those experiences and insights, being able to quickly get started, he was naturally willing, as it saved him precious time.

Qin Ming didn't exert much force; with just a gentle poke of his finger, he pierced into a stone millstone.

The Heavenly Radiance Force that emerged from his practice of the silk-bound book possessed multiple characteristics such as adhesion, tearing, and penetration. Without a doubt, the Nail Force could be integrated into it!

Suddenly, Qin Ming heard crying. He pushed open the door and stepped out.

"Old Master Li from the Li family just passed away," he heard this news on the street.

Qin Ming's heart sank. He looked up at the night sky, roughly estimating the location. The black mist that had appeared not long ago had likely landed near the Li family.

A chill ran through his heart. What was this situation?

Were there truly various soul-reaping ghosts and monsters in this world? He didn't believe in such things; even the so-called mountain monsters were just advanced aberrant creatures.

However, he had indeed discovered black mist, invisible to others, moving like a spiritual serpent from afar.

"Was that the invisible thing that Cao Long and Mu Qing spoke of, something even powerful families fear?" Qin Ming's heart tightened.

He observed the vicinity without drawing attention, but he didn't see the black mist again.

Twin Tree Village wasn't large, with only about forty households. Any little stir would quickly become known throughout the entire village.

Xu Yueping arrived, sighing, "Now that grain is being transported from the outside, and mutated creatures have retreated from the outer mountains, hunting has become safer. Just when it seemed like life was about to get better, some elderly people passed away at this very moment."

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming immediately felt something was wrong and asked, "Have many elderly people passed away recently?"

Xu Yueping nodded, saying, "Yes, in the surrounding villages, elderly people have been passing away every day recently."

Then, as if remembering something, he added, "There were also a few young people who were injured while hunting who didn't make it recently."

He lowered his voice: "Some say that the deceased young people might be connected to entering the mountains to pick up weapons. No one dares to go there recently. However, another group of people brought back weapons and didn't encounter any trouble."

Qin Ming frowned. He suspected that all of this was related to the black mist.

Moreover, he had originally seen the black mist in the great rift valley where weapons were scattered.

Qin Ming's emotions were complex. He couldn't speak of these matters to others.

His splendid mood, achieved from cultivating the Coiling Silk Force and Nail Force, was utterly ruined. Would that unfathomable yet extremely dangerous black mist return?

Qin Ming felt a strong sense of urgency, with no certainty in his heart. He didn't want to leave his fate to uncertain factors.

He strode towards Old Man Liu's house, wanting to ask where there was a blacksmith.

"You want to forge a blade, and you want to do it yourself?" Old Man Liu showed a surprised expression.

Qin Ming nodded, "Yes, I need to find a reliable blacksmith. I urgently need a good blade right now."

Old Man Liu shook his head, "So many things have happened recently, and people can go hunting in the mountains again, so the blacksmiths are incredibly busy. They're swamped right now and definitely can't spare a spot for you. How about you go early tomorrow, before they start their work?"

Qin Ming thought for a moment, then nodded. He figured if he went now, they definitely wouldn't be willing, and paying an exorbitant price at such a sensitive time would be too conspicuous.

He felt that since the black mist had just visited Twin Tree Village, it would likely move to another place for now. If such a small village had continuous deaths, it would seem abnormal no matter what.

"Let's leave in the middle of the night," he said. "It's my first time forging a blade, and I have no experience, so I don't know how long it will take."

"Why bother? Just have someone forge it," Old Man Liu said. He was well acquainted with the blacksmiths, but he was undergoing his third rebirth and it was inconvenient for him to go out and greet them. He kicked the big yellow dog, saying, "Doggy, get up, help me deliver a letter."

...

After Qin Ming returned home, he meticulously studied the blade manual to calm his mind.

He once again saw the elder, wielding his blade.

The elder had mastered a form of Interception Force, a very profound Heavenly Radiance Force technique, refined from a blend of various common force techniques.

Qin Ming didn't know how many types he had specifically integrated, as that emotional segment wasn't strong, and the scene was rather dim.

Qin Ming obtained the final Interception Force. As soon as he started practicing, he knew that this Heavenly Radiance Force technique was extremely powerful and considerably complex.

If he were to study and comprehend it himself, it would likely take a very long time, as it was no longer a single-attribute force technique, but quite profound.

Qin Ming saw that segment of the elder's memory: his comprehension of Interception Force was astonishingly for the pursuit of the legendary Sky-Severing Force!

Unfortunately, although the elder's talent was extremely high and he had progressed far on the blade dao, his life level ascension couldn't keep up, and he couldn't acquire famous force techniques. Being able to research and develop the Interception Force was already his limit.

"Just this one Interception Force makes consuming the three-colored flower worth it!" Qin Ming now understood the value of the Interception Force.

"Severing the Sky with a single line, hoping to tear open the night curtain..." He clearly discovered that even the blade manual had evolved based on this Heavenly Radiance Force. The strongest strike within it held its meaning in the words "Severing the Sky."

Qin Ming sat quietly, silently digesting for a long time. The Interception Force was indeed remarkable.

Not long after, he showed a look of surprise. His Heavenly Radiance Force truly touched upon all aspects, allowing it to integrate with the Interception Force!

Now he finally understood why that annotation was on the silk-bound book. It was indeed a deliberate reminder to future generations: "Integrate" is the only word!

"One must seek within oneself, and also borrow from external objects."

Clearly, seeking only within was not enough. Without spiritual substances, how could he rapidly elevate his life level by merely grinding away slowly on his own?

And without other force techniques, how could he integrate?

Qin Ming drank the last of the spiritual substance. After his body heated up again that night, he completely achieved his third rebirth, even faster than his second rebirth.

He felt the changes in himself. His strength had surely long surpassed three thousand jin, and his speed, physical resilience, and other bodily attributes had also improved, resulting in a significant increase in overall physical quality.

In the middle of the night, Qin Ming opened his eyes, left his home, and met up with Old Man Liu.

The blacksmith was in Silvervine Town. At this hour, it was extremely quiet; even if business was booming, no one would be working in the dead of night.

Old Man Liu, now overflowing with vitality, personally helped Qin Ming pump the bellows, raising the furnace temperature.

However, to Qin Ming's astonishment, he couldn't melt the mutton-fat jade iron no matter what he did; it only turned red-hot.

"What rare treasure is this of yours? You really have something! It must be some mysterious product from the great mountains, right?" Old Man Liu guessed immediately.

"Keep pumping the bellows!"

Ultimately, Qin Ming gave up on melting it. Taking advantage of the mutton-fat jade iron being red-hot, he swung a large hammer and smashed it furiously. Fortunately, they were underground; otherwise, the commotion in the dead of night would have been too great.

With Qin Ming's immense strength, he was still greatly exhausted by the end, as he hadn't stopped, putting all his might into every strike.

"I, an old man, underwent my third rebirth just to become a blacksmith's apprentice?"

Old Man Liu really couldn't bear to watch any longer. He stepped in himself, his skill somewhat superior to Qin Ming's, as he was well-acquainted with the blacksmiths and had personally forged blades here before.

Qin Ming learned quickly. He took the large hammer again and, with great effort, finally forged the blade.

After the final quenching, neither of them could sharpen its edge; it simply wouldn't yield to grinding.

Old Man Liu couldn't tear his gaze away. He sighed, "I think when you go to a larger place, you can have this blade re-forged. We truly can't do anything more here; the material is simply too good."

"Hmm, I'm still not sure what weapon I'll ultimately use in the future. I'll make do with this for now," Qin Ming said, looking at the blade body, which was as pure white as jade. This material was simply too conspicuous.

He brushed on the pre-prepared mineral coating, then dried it with fire.

If he truly wanted to peel off the coating, with the adhesion property of his Heavenly Radiance Force, he could simply brush his hand over it and remove it all.

Due to limited materials, even with the hilt, it wasn't as long as an arm, but it was sufficient, and Qin Ming found it quite handy.

As for the very small piece of shimmering blue jade iron, Qin Ming didn't touch it. Overly delicate small objects simply couldn't be forged here.

Qin Ming asked, "Is it a bit too early to go to that household to borrow the secret manual now?"

"The sky is as dark as ink; even the breakfast stalls in town haven't opened yet. It wouldn't be appropriate to go this early."

The two walked around the town for a long time, but couldn't even find a place to eat breakfast first.

Qin Ming's pupils contracted. What he feared had indeed arrived; he saw that black mist again.

It was actually lurking in the town, having just emerged from a household. It seemed to have spotted them both and was rapidly approaching.

"Old Man Liu, let's just go home first," Qin Ming said, pulling him to turn around and winking at Old Man Liu in the dense darkness of the night.

After Old Man Liu's third rebirth, even in such profound darkness, he could clearly see Qin Ming's expression. He immediately nodded and said, "Alright!"

The two slipped into a small alley, changing their route.

The black mist immediately changed direction and followed them.

Qin Ming realized that they had been completely targeted. It was probably because there was no one else on the streets in the latter half of the night, making the two of them too conspicuous.

Another possibility was that they had encountered the black mist in the great rift valley before. This wasn't their first meeting, and the black mist might have remembered them.

"Alternatively, could it be that when I noticed it yesterday, the black mist also noticed me?"

Regardless of the situation, things would most likely not end well today!

"Let's go, back to the village, and grab some prey on the way!" Qin Ming said, naturally tightening his grip on his blade hilt, and left Silvervine Town with Old Man Liu.

The black mist seemed very pleased for them to enter a deserted area, following silently.

As the trees on both sides of the road grew denser, the black mist could no longer hold back and suddenly lunged towards the two of them.

Qin Ming didn't hesitate either. He had been secretly on guard for a long time, and as it drew near, he delivered a backhanded strike with his blade!
