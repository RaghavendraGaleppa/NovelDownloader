# Chapter 96: Secret Martial Art, Cicada Refining Body Technique

The wound was not a cut from a blade, but a carbonized burn mark left by high heat. Dark red cracks spread like a spiderweb, and scorching fire Qi rushed down his trachea into his lungs, forcing him to cough up mercury-like blood mixed with sparks.

Before the blood droplets could hit the ground, the heat radiating from the mace’s body vaporized them into a silver mist, casting an eerie halo under the moonlight.

Xu Yunfan’s muscles swelled in the heat, and the soles of his shoes crushed earth and stone as he stepped forward.

The gilded mace swept across with the momentum, smashing into Chen Tiangang’s blocking right elbow. The elite steel-like bone emitted a crisp sound like porcelain shattering. The broken end actually melted into a translucent orange-red colloid, dripping down like softened molten glass.

Chen Tiangang stumbled back violently, thick, mercury-like blood spurting from the severed elbow. The sound of it corroding the stone slabs upon hitting the ground mixed with a burnt smell to fill the air.

Before the third breath was over, Xu Yunfan had already spun to Chen Tiangang’s backside.

The three breaths of fire Qi accumulated at the tip of the gilded mace condensed into a point of blazing white light, stabbing straight toward Chen Tiangang’s back.

The fire Qi accumulated over three breaths pierced into his core. The immediate vaporization of his body caused a vacuum collapse, and Chen Tiangang’s body exploded from the inside out.

Xu Yunfan reversed his hand and retracted the mace. Liquid glass residue flung off the mace’s tail burned honeycomb-like holes into the blue stone slabs.

The residual heat of the battlefield had yet to dissipate. The distorted air made the scattered body parts look as if seen through a layer of boiling water.

Thirty paces away, half a glass finger was stuck in the scorched earth. Inside the coral-like cavity left by the evaporated blood, a beetle, charred to a cinder, was still curled up.

The gilded mace was sheathed. The golden fire patterns on its body gradually cooled down until they returned to normal.

Xu Yunfan immediately wrapped it in a black cloth. Upon exiting the ‘Lin’ state, Xu Yunfan sat down on the ground with a thud, gasping for breath. Waves of extreme exhaustion assaulted him.

Muscle soreness, slight cracks in his bones from overexertion, and the dense, deep purple patterns covering his entire body made him look somewhat ferocious.

He couldn't continue fighting; he needed to rest for a period of time.

*‘You fought for your life amidst death and danger, swinging a heavy hammer in your hand. Your potential was stimulated, and the proficiency of the Red Copper Body Cloak Hammer Technique increased significantly.’*

*‘You utilized Cicada Strength and realized the method of high-frequency vibration between bones. The proficiency of Cicada Strength has increased.’*

*‘Your tendons snapped, moving like thunder and lightning. You constantly advanced and dodged, stepping and twisting your body, blocking from the side with perfect ease. The proficiency of your Fleetfoot Skill has greatly increased.’*

*‘...’*

The proficiency information prompts on the attribute panel in his vision appeared almost like a screen-filling刷屏 (scrolling list).

After a single battle, his skin-tempering proficiency was only two or three hundred points away from perfection.

He looked back at the distant Thunder Accumulation Mountain. Even from this far away, he could still see the firelight reaching the sky and the thick smoke connecting with the clouds.

Xu Yunfan put the iron casket back on his back and picked up the broken heavy hammer. If he found a blacksmith later, he might be able to reforge it.

He stroked the iron casket on his back. Whether it was an illusion or not, he felt that the gilded mace was more handy to use this time compared to the last.

Just as he was preparing to leave, Xu Yunfan suddenly stopped. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of a red glow. He turned his head and walked to a pile of minced meat.

He picked up a tree branch and pried it open, revealing a palm-sized iron sheet.

He took it out for a look.

*Cicada Refining Body Technique.*

Several large characters were written on the iron sheet.

Xu Yunfan stroked the dents on the iron sheet. He didn't know what material this iron sheet was forged from, but a slight numbing sensation transmitted from his fingertips.

The seemingly chaotic patterns on it, under the washing of the rain, actually revealed the direction of muscle textures.

*Whoosh!*

A whistling arrow brushed past his ear and nailed three inches deep into the ancient cypress behind him.

Xu Yunfan looked up. He naturally knew that the sound of his fight with Chen Tiangang had alerted the Tiger-Rushing Black Armor Army patrolling at the foot of Thunder Accumulation Mountain.

Fifty zhang away, the Black Armor cavalry had already formed a Wild Goose Feather Array. The nine-ringed greatsword of the leading lieutenant shone with a cold light in the rain as he charged forward alone on his horse.

"Do you guys from the Tiger-Rushing Black Armor always act this recklessly?"

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but grin. Just as the lieutenant’s nine-ringed sword劈 (chopped) toward his head, Xu Yunfan’s spinning and arm-swinging action brought forth the sound of wind and thunder.

Although he couldn't use martial arts, the opponent was at most a Second-Refinement Martial Master. He didn't even need to summon a trace of his blood Qi.

*Clang!*

The long handle of the broken heavy hammer arrived later but struck first, hitting the back of the blade. The heavy bintie sword, weighing dozens of pounds, snapped with a sound.

Xu Yunfan was stunned for a moment. The force application method he had just used was subconsciously the wing-vibrating technique from Cicada Strength.

Bone trembling, under high-frequency vibration, a punch could easily turn a person into a pulp. Yet, this mouthful of bintie greatsword was easily snapped like this.

The remaining seven riders thrust their armor-piercing spears in unison, but they saw Xu Yunfan’s back muscles undulate strangely.

The spear tips scraped past his skin, leaving only white marks on the surface.

He stomped his foot arch, spun his body up, and the long handle of the heavy steel hammer in his hand shot out like a viper spitting its tongue.

The Adam's apples of the seven Black Armor soldiers facing him almost凹陷 (collapsed) simultaneously. The Black Armor cavalrymen covered their necks and fell from their horses, their eyes bulging as they stared at their twisted cervical spines.

After clearing the enemies in front of him, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate in the slightest. He exerted force through his foot arch, his figure shooting like an arrow leaving the string, and he darted into the old forest beside him, disappearing from sight.

The remaining Black Armor cavalrymen roared in anger, but in the end, they could only watch helplessly as Xu Yunfan escaped.

Fighting on foot was a disadvantage for cavalry to begin with, let alone charging into an old forest with long spears; it was no different from seeking death.

It wasn't until he reached a mountain stream, in a place with few human traces, that Xu Yunfan finally stopped.

He was already over a hundred miles away from Thunder Accumulation Mountain.

With his hunting skills, he had been covering his tracks along the way, so he didn't need to worry about enemies catching up.

He casually hunted a river deer, cleaned it by the stream, twisted some wild growing side vegetables, crushed them into juice and smeared it over the cleaned deer, then set up a bonfire to roast it slowly.

Fortunately, he usually kept some seasonings in his waist pouch; otherwise, with his refined palate, it would be hard to swallow.

Once everything was prepared, Xu Yunfan flipped his hand and took out the iron sheet, studying it carefully.

This *Cicada Refining Body Technique* required a Cicada as a guide, and subsequently needed to引雷淬体 (draw lightning to temper the body). It utilized the numbing sensation caused by the surging lightning to practice, which could toughen flesh and blood and further enhance blood Qi and physical quality.

*"The cicada forms a cocoon, the thunder and fire forge the gold..."*

This was a Secret Martial Art!

Xu Yunfan’s spirit lifted.

Secret Martial Arts were different from traditional martial arts. They were not limited by realm and could enhance a person's foundation and blood Qi.

Why did the warriors from those aristocratic clans and major sects, coming out casually, seem much stronger than warriors of the same realm from ordinary sects? It was because they cultivated Secret Martial Arts that improved quality and efficiency.

The conditions for cultivating Secret Martial Arts were strict, and it was difficult for ordinary sects to gather the necessary requirements.

No wonder the Cicada Sect chose to establish its gate at Thunder Accumulation Mountain and erected a Thunder Tower at the summit.

If he didn't have the systematic knowledge of the Cicada Sect, he wouldn't have known this point.

Perhaps it really was a first-rate sect in the Great Zhou back in the day.

However, what excited Xu Yunfan was that this Secret Martial Art didn't actually require a Cicada as a guide or lightning tempering for the entry level. As long as he cultivated Cicada Strength to Great Perfection, making his own bones vibrate and tuning his state to a specific strange vibration state would suffice. It could greatly toughen the body and provide a leapfrogging boost to the *Cicada Cloak* external training.
