# Chapter 17: Solo Hunt

Han Yue soared freely across the sky, leaving behind a trail of radiant light in his wake. It had been a long time since he'd flown with such unrestrained freedom!

This significant breakthrough in his cultivation had once again transformed his mindset. Now, he regarded this forest as his personal hunting ground. First-level demonic beasts no longer posed any threat to him—these countless monsters had become nothing more than resources waiting to be harvested.

Han Yue soon flew past the hunting grounds of the Meat Distribution Outpost, venturing deeper until he reached an area approximately ten thousand kilometers away. The energy expenditure of his [Golden Light Flight Technique] had barely reached ten percent, while the primordial qi within his [Heavenly Origin Treasure Lotus] had already begun replenishing itself. Han Yue felt invincible.

Finally, he halted his flight and began his descent. Below him, a black bear demon was feasting on the carcass of a large deer, completely unaware of Han Yue's approach. Han Yue gave the beast no time to react—as he descended, a massive violet blade aura erupted from his form.

[Thoughtless Slash]!

The blade aura shot downward, instantly severing the black bear's neck before embedding itself deep into the earth. The massive bear's head crashed to the ground, creating a sizable crater. Blood gushed from the severed neck, raining down in a crimson shower. With a single strike, Han Yue had decapitated the first-level black bear.

At the Mastery stage, [Thoughtless Slash] could now project formidable blade auras, granting Han Yue a degree of ranged attack capability. Testing the technique on the black bear, he had unleashed one-third of the remaining energy stored in the [Thoughtless Slash] talisman—the destructive power was terrifying. Han Yue stored the bear's carcass in his Corpse Storage Bag, securing his first harvest of the day.

After cleaning up the battlefield, Han Yue summoned his golden light once more and soared away. Before long, he spotted a first-level boar demon. In a flash, he appeared beside the creature and—with a single motion—pierced its temple with a violet blade aura. After several agonized howls, the boar collapsed dead. Han Yue dispatched first-level demonic beasts as easily as plucking melons from a vine. The boar joined the bear in his storage bag, adding to his growing spoils.

At this point, the only limitation on Han Yue's hunting was his storage capacity. With room for just one more demonic beast carcass, he would have to return soon. Undeterred, Han Yue activated his [Golden Light Flight Technique] once more and continued his search. Patrolling the skies above the Demon Forest, he soon found new prey and struck again.

A violet blade aura descended from the heavens, slaying a slumbering Steel Ghost Ox. With this kill, Han Yue's Corpse Storage Bag reached full capacity. Without hesitation, he summoned his golden light and vanished from the scene.

After leaving the Meat Distribution Outpost, Han Yue had followed a triangular flight path with a ten-thousand-kilometer radius, covering an enormous area teeming with countless demons. Amidst this vast expanse, Han Yue was but a drop in the ocean. The entire journey spanned tens of thousands of kilometers, yet—even including hunting time—it took him less than half a day. His hunting efficiency far surpassed that of ordinary cultivators at the outpost.

Upon returning, Han Yue headed straight for the trading house. On the first floor, he approached the manager and sold the three demonic beast carcasses he'd collected, earning eight hundred trade coins—a substantial haul. Back in his quarters, Han Yue turned his focus inward to assess the gains and losses from his expedition.

Within his sea of consciousness, both of his divine ability talismans showed significant energy depletion. The [Golden Light Flight Technique] had consumed nearly thirty percent of its reserves, corresponding to an increase in proficiency:

[Divine Ability: Jade Void·Golden Light Flight Technique]  
[Proficiency: Novice (9%)]

Traversing tens of thousands of kilometers with the technique had deepened Han Yue's mastery. Meanwhile, the [Thoughtless Slash] was nearly depleted of energy, yet its proficiency hadn't increased—progress at the Mastery stage had become considerably more challenging.

In his dantian, the [Heavenly Origin Treasure Lotus] and Thunder Nurturing Runes formed an inexhaustible source of power, continuously generating thunder-attribute mana. Occasionally, a new Thunder Nurturing Rune would condense, circulating through Han Yue's body with his mana and adding to his accumulated strength. All his expended resources were gradually being replenished.

This expedition had not only earned him considerable wealth but also honed his divine abilities, strengthened his mana, and enriched his combat experience—truly killing multiple birds with one stone. Han Yue adjusted his routine, making hunting expeditions the cornerstone of his daily cultivation.

Thus began a period of intense yet fulfilling activity for Han Yue. On odd days, he would hunt, traversing thousands of kilometers in golden light and leaving carnage in his wake. On even days, he replenished his mana, condensed runes, and tempered his body. Spare time was spent processing spoils, with occasional meat distribution duties—his schedule was packed to the brim. His hunting grounds expanded ever further, eventually encompassing an area thirty thousand kilometers beyond the Meat Distribution Outpost.

Soaring among the clouds daily, Han Yue began to feel the transcendent exhilaration of an immortal riding the winds. The number of demons falling to his blade grew steadily, and with it, his accumulated wealth. He had long since upgraded his equipment, purchasing his own Corpse Storage Bag for five thousand trade coins—a model three times larger than Fang Yi's, capable of holding ten demonic beast carcasses. This significantly boosted his hunting efficiency.

On one such return from a hunt, Han Yue brought Xiao Liu along to browse the trading house as usual. Having witnessed Han Yue's relentless hunting spree over the past period, Xiao Liu had become thoroughly awed.

"Brother Blade, how many did you bag this time?" Xiao Liu chattered excitedly. "Your hunting exploits are the talk of the entire outpost! People keep asking me about you—I've been singing your praises everywhere. Several trading houses are practically begging you to join as their leader! My sister says the pressure's killing her—she's training like mad every day now. Says she needs to reach the second level soon, or you'll be taking over as our house leader!"

Though talkative, Xiao Liu's cheerful personality made him a favorite assistant of Han Yue's. "Enough chatter, Xiao Liu," Han Yue said with amusement. "When are you going to absorb qi into your body? New Year's not far off—still planning to gamble on a second-level demon beast?"

"Of course! Now that I'm following Brother Blade, I'm bound to succeed this year!" Xiao Liu declared, punching the air.

As they bantered, they arrived at the trading house. The first-floor manager spotted them from afar and scurried over, grinning obsequiously. "Brother Blade! Right on schedule—I've cleared space for you already!" The manager's sycophantic treatment of his best customer knew no bounds.

Han Yue nodded and produced his Corpse Storage Bag. With a shake, six massive demon carcasses tumbled out, stacking into a grisly mountain of flesh that reeked of blood for kilometers around.
