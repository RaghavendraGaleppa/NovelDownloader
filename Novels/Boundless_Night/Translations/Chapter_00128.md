# Chapter 128: Divine Domain

In the living room, filled with bronze artifacts, the calming incense in the purple copper censer had burned out and was not re-lit.

On the dark ebony tea table, the faint, lingering fragrance of camellias wafted up as a man and a woman calmly and leisurely drank tea.

Qin Ming entered the living room and recognized them at a glance. The man was Cui He, in his early thirties, with a peaceful expression and hair that shimmered with a faint green luster.

“Well, well, boy, it’s been two years. You look much more energetic than before.” Cui He stood up, strode over, a smile on his face, and placed his hands on Qin Ming’s shoulders, shaking them warmly.

“Fourth Uncle,” Qin Ming greeted with a smile.

In the past, his relationship with Cui He was merely cordial, with little interaction. But today, with Cui He smiling at him, Qin Ming couldn’t respond coldly.

“Hmm, good. Your body has strong vitality. You’re a promising candidate for the New Life Path,” Cui He observed him, a flash of green light in his eyes.

Qin Ming knew that Cui He practiced the *Evergreen Wood Cultivation Art*, a powerful secret tome that allowed him to absorb plant vitality, filling his body with vigorous life.

“I was gravely ill and barely survived; how could I have any vitality? Fourth Uncle, on the other hand, your cultivation has deepened remarkably, your body is brimming with the fresh energy of plants. You must have gained decades of lifespan beyond ordinary people.”

Qin Ming had long since activated his technique to conceal his aura, so even with Cui He’s hands on his shoulders, he couldn’t fully discern Qin Ming’s abundant vitality.

Cui He wrapped an arm around his shoulder and said, “You’re such a humble child. As a man from our Cui family, you shouldn’t lack ambition. No matter what, even if you no longer use that name, you are still my nephew.”

Qin Ming smiled and said, “I’d like to be high-profile, but I don’t have the strength for it. If only I had half of Fourth Uncle’s power from his youth, I would definitely go out and make a name for myself.”

“You two are quite good at flattering each other.” The woman drinking tea rose. Dressed in black, she was quite cold and beautiful, yet also exuded an aura of nobility.

“Aunt.” Qin Ming felt a strong resistance internally, yet he had to smile and feign civility with them.

The woman in black was Cui Shuning. In the past, Qin Ming’s relationship with her had been distant. Even though they often met, there was a sense of alienation, and it was clear she had long known their true identities and the truth.

“Fourth Uncle and Aunt usually focus on cultivation. How do you have time to come to this remote place today?” Qin Ming asked.

Cui He replied, “We were passing by on an errand and decided to drop in on you. Sigh, what happened back then was truly complicated. Don’t take it to heart. Your parents actually miss you very much.”

Qin Ming nodded with a slight smile, knowing these words were just for show.

“Why don’t you come back with us?” Cui Shuning’s cold face broke into a smile, like ice melting, a stark contrast to her usual demeanor.

“You’ve suffered outside these past two years. Come with us,” Cui He also nodded, his green hair flowing with light, exuding strong Wood-Elemental essence.

Qin Ming’s hairs nearly stood on end. If he went back, he certainly wouldn’t be able to leave again. He might not die, but he could forget about walking the New Life Path.

After fully recovering his memories, based on his understanding of these “elders,” they would most likely confine him to a courtyard.

Qin Ming now had precise control over his body. He instantly relaxed and shook his head, saying, “If I go back, it’s bound to stir up a lot of trouble.”

“Are you still practicing the Silk Tome?” Cui Shuning asked nonchalantly.

Qin Ming knew the main event was coming. They probably had suspicions, which was why two direct descendants were sent out.

He sighed lightly, his eyes dimming. “My skull was shattered, and I lost my memory for over two years, so I stopped practicing the Silk Tome technique. I haven’t practiced it since.”

“Sigh, you’ve suffered,” Cui Shuning reached out to touch his head.

Qin Ming felt disgusted, strongly resisting. He truly didn’t want anyone touching his head.

For a moment, he didn’t even want to pretend anymore.

Finally, Cui Shuning withdrew her hand, sighing lightly, “You’ve grown up. It’s not appropriate to treat you like a child anymore.”

In truth, it was mainly her潔癖 (germophobia/neat freak tendencies). Born into a millennium-old aristocratic family, accustomed to luxury and nobility, she didn’t want to touch the hair of a young man who now had little connection to her, even if he was quite handsome. She still felt a bit of disdain.

“That used to be your obsession. You started practicing it from a young age, for over a decade. With your natural talent, you might have succeeded if you had continued,” Cui He sighed.

Qin Ming’s cultivation realm was still low, otherwise, he would have truly wanted to grab them and ask how this “obsession” was formed.

Fortunately, he had ultimately succeeded in mastering the technique from the Silk Tome!

Qin Ming put on a dejected expression and said, “Fourth Uncle, Aunt, can you return the Silk Tome to me? It’s the only thing my grandfather left me.”

Cui He nodded and said, “The Silk Tome has been taken by the Old Ancestor for research. Once he emerges from seclusion, I will personally send it to you.”

Qin Ming didn’t believe a single word of the latter half of his sentence; they clearly had no intention of returning it.

He realized that unless his strength reached a certain level, or he had a powerful external backer, it would be difficult to retrieve the Silk Tome.

Cui Shuning said, “I heard that you were personally chosen by Meng Xinghai as the top talent in this city. It seems you are progressing steadily and quickly on the New Life Path. Your talent is indeed astonishing.”

Qin Ming said, “I’m ashamed. I accidentally became someone with connections. It’s all thanks to Uncle Meng’s kindness. My true strength is a bit exaggerated.”

Cui He laughed, “I heard you got into a fight with that brat from the Li family and kicked Li Qingxiao twice? Excellent! Truly worthy of a child from our Cui family, that’s how it should be!”

Qin Ming guessed that this was Cui He’s only “true smile.” Seeing the Li family suffer a setback would greatly please the Cui family.

Cui Shuning also smiled. “Indeed, well kicked. The Li family only has about eight hundred years of history, yet they're already presumptuously trying to swallow an elephant and enter the ranks of millennium-old families. They overestimate themselves.”

Then, her expression turned serious. “Your talent is extraordinary, and you can go very far on this path. Why don’t you become a Jade-Armored Guard for Chonghe?”

Cui Shuning stared at his face, seemingly not wanting to miss any change in his expression.

Qin Ming thought to himself: *How audacious of you!*

He shook his head and said, “My strength is too low; I can’t be a Jade-Armored Guard.”

Cui He also spoke up, “We’re all family. You and Chonghe should be as close as brothers. Now that you’re no longer practicing the Silk Tome technique and have truly embarked on the New Life Path, with the Cui family behind you, we can provide you with all sorts of resources to help you rise quickly. Your realm will soon improve, and you can go help Chonghe.”

He was also staring at Qin Ming’s face, green light swirling in his eyes.

Qin Ming shook his head, refusing again.

He had once sworn that after his arduous cultivation, he would not be anyone’s follower, much less a guard for Cui Chonghe!

Qin Ming looked at the two of them. What exactly did they want to do?

He suddenly realized that the Cui family was suspicious about whether he had mastered the technique from the Silk Tome.

Cui He suddenly said, “Qin Ming, if you’re not coming home, you’re not being low-key enough here. Even far away in Radiance City, we all know you’ve become the ‘top talent’ of a city.”

Qin Ming was taken aback. Cui He’s change of demeanor was too quick; his smile had suddenly vanished, and his words were quite stiff.

He noticed that both of them were watching him.

Qin Ming frowned. The two of them had first shown affection, then suddenly asked about the Silk Tome, then suggested he become Cui Chonghe’s guard, and now their attitude was harsh, blaming him for being high-profile.

He understood that they were doing this intentionally, observing his expressions and probing his mind through different attitudes and emotions.

Ultimately, the Cui family, for some unknown reason, felt uneasy about him.

Qin Ming pondered, believing their only concern was probably that he had succeeded in mastering the technique from the Silk Tome.

“I’ve already changed my name and settled in a remote place. I’m no longer the Cui Chonghe of the past. Is that still not enough?” he asked sincerely.

Cui Shuning nodded and said, “Indeed, it’s still not low-key enough.”

Cui He looked very serious and asked, “Are you planning to join an ancient lineage or a special advanced academy? Why don’t you come back to the Cui family with us?”

Qin Ming had been patiently "playing along," enduring them for a long time.

Now, his smile vanished, and he didn’t want to say anything more.

If the Cui family continued to pressure him like this, it would be too much. He was Qin Ming now; he had long since cut ties with his past. What more did they want?

It was clear that some people in the Cui family were growing increasingly uneasy and wanted to sabotage his future, preventing him from joining an ancient lineage or a special advanced academy.

“You two, leave. You’re not welcome here,” Meng Xinghai walked into the living room, his face displeased.

Cui Shuning smiled. “Brother Meng, we are talking with our own family’s child. It has little to do with you.”

Cui He also spoke, “Brother Meng, we have a deep affection for this child. This is our family matter. We came here to take him back and nurture him carefully.”

Meng Xinghai’s face darkened. “We all know each other’s backgrounds. Don’t speak such words in front of me. You two leave immediately, or don’t blame me for being impolite.”

Cui Shuning chuckled, “Brother Meng, don’t be angry. Can’t we be reasonable? This truly is a child raised by our family. No matter where we go to argue, we are in the right.”

“You abandoned him. If you’re not afraid of losing face and being seen as cruel and ungrateful, then by all means, dredge up all those past events and tell them again. Besides, don’t say I have no relation to him—this is my future son-in-law.”

Meng Xinghai’s words not only startled the two Cui family members but also made Qin Ming slightly dazed.

“You don’t even have a daughter. How could he be your son-in-law?” Cui Shuning laughed.

Meng Xinghai said, “If I don’t have a daughter, can’t I have one? Furthermore, if time is short, can’t I just adopt a daughter?”

Cui Shuning’s face turned slightly cold. “Brother Meng, you value a child raised by my family that much?”

“If you don’t leave, then I’ll have no choice but to ask you to get out!” Meng Xinghai’s expression hardened. He had heard all the conversations in the living room and had tolerated them for a long time.

“Brother Meng, you’ve gone too far!”

“Meng Xinghai, I advise you not to be so overbearing.”

With a *boom*, all the ancient bronze artifacts in the living room began to glow, and the calming incense in the purple copper censer even ignited on its own.

“You refuse to show me face, is that it?” Meng Xinghai’s voice was chilling.

From the purple copper censer, burning incense billowed out a large amount of white mist, which spread rapidly, covering the two individuals in front.

Naturally, they wouldn’t surrender. Cui He’s entire body emitted a greenish light; his hair and eyes turned emerald green, and terrifying power erupted!

Cui Shuning’s glabella expanded with a spiritual light of consciousness, transforming into a spiritual blade that slashed forward.

In the living room, all the ancient bronze artifacts became crystal clear, emanating ripples that instantly solidified the space.

Neither Cui He nor Cui Shuning could move. They were suppressed, gasping for breath, their faces pale.

“This is… Divine Domain?”

“His divine consciousness has transformed into a domain!”

The two spoke one after another, realizing that the other party’s strength was a cut above theirs; they were simply not on the same level.

The white mist drifting from the purple copper censer acted like ropes, binding the two of them. It coiled around their bodies in layer after layer of white mist. Then, the two were lifted off the ground and thrown out of the living room, landing awkwardly in the courtyard.

“Begone!” Meng Xinghai reprimanded.

The two said nothing, got up, and immediately left.

Meng Xinghai slapped his forehead and said, “Drat, these two deliberately offended you. They were actually testing my attitude towards you to assess your current potential and status.”

He had initially wanted to chase after them but stopped. “Forget it. If you want to enter the ancestral grounds of a great sect or a famous advanced academy, you’ll have to show your true abilities anyway. A talent hidden in a bag will eventually pierce through; it can’t be concealed.”

It took Qin Ming a long time to calm his emotions. The arrival of those two had severed the last lingering ties to his past!

“Uncle Meng, do I need to live anonymously? Should I just go into… the dark mountains?”

Meng Xinghai said, “Where are you getting such ideas? Don’t worry, some people in the Cui family can’t dominate everything in the Night Mist World. Just perform well and strive to become a core disciple of a top-tier major power as soon as possible.”

Qin Ming breathed a sigh of relief. “Then I feel much better. Uncle Meng, besides my arranged duel with Qi Daoming from Radiance City, I think some people from the Cui family will also step in to test me. They want to verify some things. How about, Uncle Meng, you and I discuss it? If Cui He tries to interfere and sends someone to participate, make him put the *Evergreen Wood Cultivation Art* as the wager.”

Meng Xinghai’s eyes held a strange look. Just a moment ago, he thought Qin Ming was dejected and about to be relegated to the desolate wilderness of the Night Mist World, but now he found that Qin Ming was still eyeing their secret tome.

“After all, I lived in the Cui family for over ten years; I know Fourth Uncle Cui He’s style,” Qin Ming said calmly.
