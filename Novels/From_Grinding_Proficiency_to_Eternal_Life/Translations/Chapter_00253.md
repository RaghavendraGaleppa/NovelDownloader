# Chapter 253: Suddenly, Ten Thousand Zhang of Pure Radiance

The great dragon of his spine trembled segment by segment, actually transmitting the rumbling roar of earth veins surging upward.

Under the condition that the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique had reached perfection, the unique phenomenon of "Earth Vein Forging Bones," exclusive to the Marrow Cleansing Realm, began to slowly manifest.

His entire body's muscles and pores tightened, and the great dragon on his back burst forth with waves of Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength, which began to circulate within his spine bones.

He lightly flicked his arm bone with his finger, and it actually produced a deep, resonant sound like that of a great bell. A trace of joy could not help but flash through his eyes. This was precisely the sign of "Jade Bone, Golden Sound" recorded in the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique!

Only by cultivating the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique to its extreme, reaching a state of near perfection and flawlessness, could one achieve such a spectacle.

Under the violent scouring of his vital blood, muscle fibers frantically reorganized, and the knotted muscle bundles swelled up like magma earth veins.

Every strand of muscle was entwined with the unique golden-red flow of light of the Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength. The subcutaneous fascia rose and fell with his breath, faintly outlining the scale patterns of the Nine-Headed Xiangliu.

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly, and he instantly understood that it was because of the fierce beast essence qi remaining after he had devoured too many demon beasts' flesh and blood. He immediately drew upon his Pure Yang Internal Breath, using the fierce and yang energy to continuously cleanse and convert it.

So that's how it is...

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a bit fortunate in his heart. If not for the Pure Yang One Qi Technique and the Attribute Panel's enhancement, he would have anticipated this step much earlier if he were to devour demon beasts' flesh and blood and absorb their essence qi so recklessly.

A moment later, when Xu Yunfan suddenly clenched his fist, the explosive force from between his fingers directly tore apart the rock wall three zhang away. His eyes moved slightly; he hadn't expected that just by unleashing his vital blood and挥出 pure power, he could already cause a small-scale disturbance in the atmosphere of heaven and earth.

His vital blood surged through his body like pythons.

The originally thick and sticky blood, like mercury, now seemed to have condensed into ten thousands of strands flickering with a golden-red hue.

These thick mercury-like bloodstains washed through his entire body with the pumping of his heart, destroying the old marrow wherever they passed, and new marrow began to be born immediately.

Nine muffled thunders exploded from deep within his kneecap. The turbid marrow that had accumulated in his spine for over twenty years turned into green smoke and evaporated from the top of his head. The new golden marrow, like molten iron, climbed up section by section along the spinal canal.

When the golden marrow passed the Baihui acupoint at the top of his head, Xu Yunfan's seven orifices suddenly spewed out rosy clouds. Behind him, nine towering mountains of alternating reality and illusion appeared. This was the concrete manifestation of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique reaching perfection.

A Marrow Cleansing Grandmaster could already penetrate the marrow with strength, rise to the head, and train strength into the brain.

Only in this way could one achieve microscopic control of strength, reaching the internal organs, and thus train the organs.

The transformation brought by the Marrow Cleansing Realm went far beyond this.

The Three Jiao Sword-Nourishing Technique's refined Three Jiao meridians, under the calcination of the Pure Yang Internal Breath, actually began to generate a large amount of sword qi.

The vibrations echoing within his bone marrow were continuous like thunder. Each breath caused the dragon scale armor leaves to rustle and tremble.

Xu Yunfan could clearly perceive that the Thousand-Jun Mountain momentum he carried with his every movement could, with a casual shake, unleash the power to shake mountains.

"The Marrow Cleansing Realm... strength penetrates the microscopic, reaching the internal organs!"

Xu Yunfan clenched his five fingers in the air, and the air actually cracked with a sonic boom.

The sword qi derived from the Three Jiao Sword-Nourishing Technique, under the calcination of the strength derived from the Pure Yang Golden Marrow, roamed his body like ten thousand needles. The thunder-like vibrations within his bone marrow caused the dragon scale armor leaves to rustle and tremble, each leaf shimmering with a golden-red glow.

"So that's how it is..."

Xu Yunfan slowly raised his head. With each breath, wisps of spiritual qi began to continuously enter his body through his nostrils, moving from his bone marrow and dispersing throughout his entire body.

He could finally, without using the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, just by using his marrow strength, draw upon the spiritual qi of heaven and earth into his body.

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly. The spiritual qi he inhaled and exhaled through his nostrils suddenly stagnated. He raised his head and looked toward the center of the small world secret realm.

He saw the end of the sky in that direction explode with ten thousand zhang of pure radiance. Clear and transparent light pierced through the secret realm's clouds and shot straight into the heavens, illuminating the thousands of miles of mountains and rivers as if they were a world of glazed glass.

The light was like a celestial river pouring down, sacred and clear, dyeing half the sky a glazed color. Where the clouds were pierced, ethereal fairy music seemed to linger.

A Divine Weapon!

At least an Eighth Rank Divine Weapon awakening in its entirety, pouring out its reserves accumulated over countless years, could produce such a spectacle.

Judging by its momentum, it might even be the legendary Ninth Rank Heaven and Earth Divine Weapon!

Weapons in the world: first and second rank are mundane tools; third, fourth, and fifth rank are divided into upper, middle, and lower grades; sixth rank are Treasure Tools; seventh, eighth, and ninth rank are Divine Weapons.

Nine is the extreme, worthy of being called a Heaven and Earth Divine Weapon!

It cannot be forged by human power; it is truly born of heaven and earth. Either it is nourished by earth veins day and night, or it is baptized by heavenly thunder. Only after a long period of growth can it achieve success.

To think that a Heaven and Earth Divine Weapon would emerge in this small world secret realm...

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered. He had just entered the Marrow Cleansing Realm and naturally did not fear the others in the secret realm.

Perhaps these true disciples of top sects were either stuck at the Sanhe stage or徘徊 at the Flesh Refining Realm. Since he had now entered Marrow Cleansing, he naturally wouldn't have the slightest fear.

If he could seize the Heaven and Earth Divine Weapon...

He tapped the ground with his toes and soared into the air. The formidable strength from his marrow in the Marrow Cleansing Realm unleashed an astonishing force, and nine waves of air rippled out from beneath his feet.

He left behind layers of sonic booms and vanished from his original location in an instant.

When he arrived at the source of the pure radiance, the scene before him made Xu Yunfan's pupils contract sharply.

A collapsed mountain body was split open as if by a giant axe, and from the crevice, the eaves of a half-ruined White Jade Palace were visible.

It seemed that because of the eruption of the pure radiance, this mountain had been blown apart from within, revealing this White Jade Palace.

The star stones embedded in the palace body were gushing forth pure light. The bronze bells hanging from the corner of the eaves rang on their own without wind, and the sound waves they produced actually shattered the nearby demons into clouds of blood mist.

On the lintel of the palace, five complex characters he couldn't recognize were carved in meteoric iron. The brushstrokes were like swords, and each character exuded an astonishing sword momentum.

From within this palace, the ultimate brilliance was emerging.

Xu Yunfan's gaze was like lightning, sweeping over the surroundings in an instant, finally locking onto a corner of a nearby mountain peak.

He glanced at the faintly visible White Jade Palace below. His figure suddenly blurred, and the next moment, he appeared at the edge of the cliff like a ghost.

"Brother Su, I hope you have been well!"

The corners of his mouth curled up, his voice low and cold, his gaze falling on Su Zhenhe, who was crouching at the edge of the cliff.

This true disciple of the Xuanzhen Sect was currently staring intently at the palace below, his eyes flashing with a look of wild joy, and he hadn't even noticed Xu Yunfan's arrival.

When he heard Xu Yunfan's voice, a piercing chill shot up Su Zhenhe's spine. His muscle memory reacted before his consciousness did. Two bursts of air exploded from his heels, and his figure shot backward three zhang like a startled sparrow.

When his back slammed against the rock wall, the特有的 bloodthirsty aura of the Dragon Scale Armor came rushing at him.

Xu Yunfan stood with his arms crossed on a lava crevice three zhang away. The Taotie pattern on the end of the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace was spewing a dark red glow.

After reaching Marrow Cleansing, he could finally subdue this divine weapon with his own immense power.

It was truly not easy.

Various emotions constantly intertwined in his eyes.

As his Adam's apple rolled with difficulty, dozens of emotions flashed through Su Zhenhe's eyes.

He was horrified that the other party could silently break through his five-zhang range. He was terrified because he smelled the fresh scent of blood on the Dragon Scale Armor.

But more than that, he was thinking about whether Xu Yunfan had discovered the White Jade Palace below, and the killing intent that surged in his heart.
