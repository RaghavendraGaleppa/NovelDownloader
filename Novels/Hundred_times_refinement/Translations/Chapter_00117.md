# Chapter 67: The Essence of Ginseng

As another disciple finished asking a question and sat down, Lin Xuan seized the opportunity to stand up first. He bowed respectfully and said, "Esteemed Elder, this junior pays his respects. I have a cultivation question I'd like to ask for your guidance."

"Hmm, speak," the elder replied, his eyes still half-closed, though his expression showed he was pleased with Lin Xuan's politeness.

"Recently, while practicing Spirit Control Technique, I've encountered difficulties. No matter how hard I try, I make no progress. I humbly request your guidance, Elder."

"Spirit Control Technique?"

The elder opened his eyes and scrutinized Lin Xuan from head to toe. The gazes of the other elite disciples were drawn to him as well, including even the Cloud Fairy, who gave him an extra glance.

The reason was simple—one would only practice the Spirit Control Technique if they possessed a spirit artifact. And spirit artifacts, being simplified versions of magic treasures, were extremely rare. Even among these elite disciples, only a few owned one.

"You're Ye Tian?"

"Yes," Lin Xuan replied calmly, though inwardly he breathed a sigh of relief. According to the demonic cultivation manual, this disguise technique could only be seen through by cultivators two realms higher than him. But whether it was truly that effective, Lin Xuan wasn't entirely confident. 

The elder was a peak Foundation Establishment expert, and Lin Xuan had felt nervous when standing up, hoping the technique's description wasn't exaggerated. Seeing that the elder indeed mistook him for Ye Tian, the stone in Lin Xuan's heart finally settled.

"Show me your spirit artifact."

This time, Lin Xuan didn't hesitate. With his wealth of treasures, a low-grade spirit artifact was nothing to him. He smoothly took out the Fire Serpent.

"Just a low-grade spirit artifact."

Lin Xuan noticed that the three cultivators at the seventh layer, including the Cloud Fairy, merely glanced at it before turning away, clearly possessing better treasures. 

The other elite disciples, with the exception of a few who showed no envy, were all filled with admiration. This further proved how precious spirit artifacts truly were.

"You're practicing Spirit Control Technique?"

"Yes. The Manipulation Technique can only unleash part of a spirit artifact's power, so I boldly..."

Before Lin Xuan could finish, the elder interrupted, "At your current sixth-layer cultivation, while it's theoretically possible to practice the Spirit Control Technique, mastering it is more suited for Foundation Establishment cultivators. Hitting a wall and making no progress is normal. Set it aside for now and resume after you've built your foundation."

"Thank you for your guidance, Elder." Lin Xuan spoke politely, but inwardly he had no intention of giving up. In two battles, he had deeply experienced the immense power of spirit artifacts. Though he was now at the sixth layer of the Spirit Movement Stage, Foundation Establishment was still far off. Who would want to wait that long? 

Feigning reluctance, he hesitantly asked, "Elder, is it truly impossible to master the Spirit Control Technique without reaching Foundation Establishment?"

"Of course it's possible," the elder replied firmly. "Otherwise, the technique wouldn't specify that it can be practiced in the late Spirit Movement Stage. It's just that lower-level cultivators need a stroke of luck to master it."

"A stroke of luck?"

"Indeed. It's not just about spiritual roots—it also requires a bit of fortune and inspiration. Hard work alone won't suffice."

Lin Xuan frowned. The so-called "inspiration" was too elusive. Some might break through by chance, while others might suddenly grasp it after long practice. But for most, they would remain stuck at the bottleneck.

He knew his own aptitude well and had little confidence in himself.

"Elder, is there no better experience or shortcut?"

"There is—unless you consume large amounts of Ginseng Essence while practicing the Spirit Control Technique." The elder, Li, was growing impatient with Lin Xuan's persistent questions.

Ginseng Essence?

The disciples below all gasped at the mention. As the name suggested, this medicinal ingredient was the essence extracted from ginseng—and only from ginseng over a thousand years old, refined through secret methods.

"Large amounts"? That was a joke. Forget Ye Tian—even Sect Leader Yunhe Zhenren couldn't afford such extravagance.

Lin Xuan froze, his face ashen—but only on the surface. Inwardly, he was ecstatic. Consulting the elder had been the right move. Consuming Ginseng Essence could help break through the bottleneck in practicing the Spirit Control Technique—something he would never have discovered on his own.

To others, Ginseng Essence was indeed precious. Even in the cultivation world, thousand-year spirit herbs were exceedingly rare. But Lin Xuan was different—the blue star sea within him granted him the ability to purify items.

Ginseng Essence only formed in thousand-year ginseng. But through purification, even hundred-year—or even decades-old—ginseng could yield the essence for him.

Suppressing his excitement, Lin Xuan feigned a crestfallen expression, bowed to Elder Li, and turned to leave the hall.

His departure didn't raise suspicions. According to Floating Cloud Valley's rules, attendance at lectures was optional. Whether one came or left midway, no one would stop them. His exit, seemingly due to frustration over unresolved cultivation issues, was perfectly normal.

The elite disciples reacted differently—some indifferent, some gloating, some uncaring...

Only Ma Tianxiong patted Lin Xuan's shoulder. "Junior Brother Ye, don't take it to heart. You can practice it slowly after Foundation Establishment."

Far from being disheartened, Lin Xuan was in excellent spirits. Ideally, he would have liked to stay longer—the elite hall elder's cultivation far surpassed that of the instructors at the Young Eagle Pavilion. Listening to his teachings would greatly benefit his future cultivation.

But he had no choice. The Heavenly Demon Disguise Technique, though exquisite, had a time limit. If his true appearance were revealed, it would spell disaster. Weighing the pros and cons, Lin Xuan reluctantly left.

The elite hall was heavily guarded, but fortunately, its restrictions were one-way—allowing exit but not entry. Entering triggered the restrictions to verify identity, but leaving was much easier, with no barriers.

Lin Xuan safely departed the elite hall.
