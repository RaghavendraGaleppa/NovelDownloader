**Chapter 44: Extreme Soldier Body Transformation, Divine Weapon Acquired!**

The dark, ancient hammer hung silently, inverted, at the boundary between ice and fire. It was approximately three hundred paces from the cave entrance.

"Hoo..." Li Mo exhaled a plume of white mist, his forehead slick with sweat. After walking a hundred paces, he was already drenched, his very bones itching from the vibrations within. He was exhausted, but the light in Li Mo's eyes grew brighter. The divine weapon tempered his bones; with every step, he could feel his qi and blood strengthening, his physique being honed to greater power. In just a hundred paces, he had actually opened another meridian.

Thirteen meridians.

For normal martial artists, twelve meridians was the limit, at which point they would begin condensing blood into qi, transforming internal energy into breath. Li Mo had now completely surpassed the Qi and Blood Realm. Furthermore, his progress was far from over.

One hundred and forty paces.

"The pressure is getting more intense." Li Mo's steps became increasingly difficult, his physical body reaching its limit at this point. Fine lines of blood faintly appeared on his skin. He had already used the Extreme Soldier Body method as much as possible to reduce the damage caused by the weapon's sharp killing aura. But a divine weapon was still a divine weapon.

"Fortunately, I still have some martial dao insights left," he muttered. "Otherwise, I'd have to stop here today..." Li Mo still wanted to try. As a result, when he took another step forward, the oppressive killing aura instantly surged from all directions. Blood immediately seeped from the lacerations, his body showing faint signs of collapse. He quickly retreated.

"Alright, no more struggling." Little Li, realizing the formidable power, let out a sigh. He would have preferred not to resort to using his insights, but reality wouldn't allow otherwise. He couldn't get the divine weapon just by relying on sheer effort. "Let's start with twenty years' worth," he thought.

Li Mo's mind stirred, and he chose to gain insight into the Extreme Soldier Body.

**[Ten years of martial dao insights successfully injected.]**
**[Year 1: Observing the divine weapon 'Armageddon Meteorite Hammer,' you gain a deeper understanding of body-refining, and begin contemplating the core principles of "Extreme Soldier Body."]**
**[Year 8: You finally comprehend "Extreme Soldier Body" to the Grand Completion realm.]**
**[Year 10: You begin exploring the profound mysteries of body-refining and attempt to reach the Transformation realm...]**

After ten years of insight, his comprehension of Extreme Soldier Body directly reached Grand Completion. No, to be precise, it was eight years. Little Li covered his face, once again facing reality. For superior sword arts, the 'ice block' taught him personally. For ultimate body-refining methods, he practiced himself. Yet, the former consumed several times more martial dao insights than the latter.

"Alright then." Li Mo activated the Grand Completion realm Extreme Soldier Body. Instantly, the frenzied, sharp killing aura from all directions became much more docile. He walked more resolutely towards the Armageddon Meteorite Hammer. One step, two steps... ten steps, a hundred steps... In the blink of an eye, he was only about fifty paces from the ice-fire boundary.

Just as Li Mo stepped within fifty paces.

Boom—

The sound of the hammer, like thunder, exploded. The sharp killing aura instantly surged again. He felt as if he had walked into a whirlpool, constantly enduring countless scourges every moment.

"No wonder the Armageddon Meteorite Hammer can forge Profound Weapons," Li Mo mused. "With one strike from this hammer, even famous artifacts probably couldn't withstand it." Li Mo even felt like a weapon himself, being baptized by this divine hammer. The first patriarch of Divine Weapon Peak must have been a formidable expert. At the very least, his attainments in body-refining were undeniable. No wonder Elder Cold Crane just let this hammer lie at the bottom of the Divine Edge Cave. Perhaps it was because he wanted to use it but lacked the strength to do so...

"Even Vision God Realm experts might not be qualified to stand before this hammer," he thought. "What kind of powerhouse can wield it as an extension of their arm?"

Li Mo stopped thinking further. "I'll be the one to push it further first." Martial dao insights were poured into the Grand Completion realm "Extreme Soldier Body."

**[Year 1: Observing the divine weapon, you gradually comprehend the true meaning of 'transforming body into weapon,' and begin to emit a sharp killing aura from your own being.]**
**[Year 3: Your own sharp killing aura resonates with the divine weapon's killing aura, complementing each other.]**
**[Year 12: You finally reach the pinnacle of perfection, understanding this cultivation method no less than its creator.]**
**[Insight complete, "Extreme Soldier Body" has reached the Transformation realm!]**
