# Chapter 116 Settling In

On his way back to Jiufeng, Li Shiming couldn't help but think about the deceased Qi Refining cultivator. He had a suspicion—perhaps this cultivator's death wasn't related to the Law Enforcement Hall at all, but had suffered in his stead.

Judging by the timeline, the Qi Refining cultivator at Yingzui Island had been killed shortly after Qiu Tan and the two shop assistants disappeared. He didn't share this deduction with Uncle Zhuge—not because he didn't want to, but because he couldn't. There were simply too many things he couldn't explain.

Once again arriving at Zhongfeng, this time he headed straight for Tianhai Hall at the summit. Tianhai Hall was the main hall of Zhongfeng, located halfway up the mountain, and served as the core of Tianhai Sect.

"Elder Yu, Zhuge Xuan requests an audience!" Uncle Zhuge announced at the entrance of Tianhai Hall, channeling his spiritual power into his voice. Despite his anger, he suppressed his rage upon arriving here, though his tone still betrayed his fury.

"Junior Brother Zhuge, come in!" a booming voice called from inside.

"Follow me," Uncle Zhuge gestured to Li Shiming before stepping into the grand hall first.

The hall was bustling with cultivators, all busy with their tasks. Uncle Zhuge led Li Shiming to an inner section, entering a spacious office. A tall, burly man sat behind a desk piled high with documents.

"Take a seat, Junior Brother Zhuge. Speak your mind—as you can see, I'm swamped here..." The burly man was about to complain when he noticed Li Shiming entering behind Uncle Zhuge and abruptly stopped. Some words could be said in front of a junior brother but not in front of disciples.

"Elder Yu, this is Li Shiming. He recently passed the formation master examination—a genius formation master from our Jingfeng. The Law Enforcement Hall seized his cave residence and assigned him a suicide mission. I've brought him here to demand an explanation!" Uncle Zhuge pointed at Li Shiming as he spoke.

Truth be told, Li Shiming couldn't see any semblance of a sect leader in Elder Yu.

"You're Li Shiming? Don't worry, you won't lack a cave residence," Elder Yu said with a reassuring smile upon hearing Li Shiming's name, as if recalling something.

"But it's not just about the cave residence. A disciple died inside after the Law Enforcement Hall transferred ownership!" Uncle Zhuge pressed, puzzled by Elder Yu's attitude.

"I understand," Elder Yu raised a hand to calm him, then issued a command through his sect leader's token. Only then did he scrutinize Li Shiming.

He knew of Li Shiming—Junior Sister Yin had approached him about the cave residence issue. Had she not insisted on waiting for Li Shiming's return, he would have resolved it long ago.

During this time, Elder Yu hadn't been idle. He had already investigated the entire matter and was merely waiting for the final steps.

At that moment, Law Enforcement Hall's Steward Xu entered the office with his trusted subordinate, Han Tianlei. Steward Xu greeted Uncle Zhuge with a smile, but the latter remained cold and unresponsive.

Han Tianlei, however, paled upon seeing Li Shiming. The joy of meeting the sect leader vanished, replaced by sheer terror. He couldn't fathom how a newly recruited disciple with no background could appear before the sect leader.

"Han Tianlei, from the Han Clan of Nanshan Country. In your fifty-three years in the sect, you've sent three Qi Refining disciples on missions to Nanshan Country—all of whom disappeared, after which you profited greatly. This report from Nanshan Country's stationed cultivator confirms the Han Clan's collusion with the Profound Nether Sect, using living humans to cultivate demonic techniques." Elder Yu's measured tone carried lethal weight.

"Sect Leader, spare me!" Han Tianlei prostrated himself, begging for mercy.

"Elder Yu, Han Tianlei has erred, but he's also rendered great service to the sect. Shouldn't his punishment be lighter?" Steward Xu interjected, realizing this was Zhuge Xuan's doing. Having recently benefited from Han Tianlei and finding him useful, Steward Xu had to show support—otherwise, who would work for him in the future?

"Xu Peiran, do you think you're blameless?" Elder Yu's icy gaze turned to Steward Xu.

A terrifying aura filled the room—Elder Yu's presence surpassed any Foundation Establishment cultivator Li Shiming had encountered.

Steward Xu stared blankly at Elder Yu. Knowing the sect leader's temperament, being addressed by full name meant serious trouble. He glared resentfully at Li Shiming, unable to comprehend why a mere disciple would warrant such a response.

"Xu Peiran, your greed for petty gains is one thing, but you're a Law Enforcement Hall steward! If even you are corrupt, what does that say about our sect? Surrender your position. Use your sect merit points to purchase Yingzui Island—it will belong to Li Shiming permanently. Prepare to guard the Tianhai frontline for twenty years!" Elder Yu said with disappointed fury.

Upon hearing about using his merit points for Yingzui Island, Steward Xu felt a pang but remained composed. Though the island held little value, renting and purchasing were entirely different. Purchasing granted permanent ownership—a cost far beyond any Qi Refining cultivator's means. Even for Steward Xu, it required years of accumulated merit points, which he accepted.

But the twenty-year frontline assignment drained the color from his face. He stared at Elder Yu in disbelief, thinking it a joke.

Elder Yu spoke again—this time via sound transmission, unheard by others. After hearing the message, Steward Xu's resistance vanished. He now wished to depart immediately for the frontline. Though dangerous, it was preferable to facing the wrath of an elder upon their return. Moreover, Elder Yin was lenient compared to the Profound Nether Sect's Ren the Demon—death would be a mercy then. Elder Yu's punishment was protection.

"I accept my faults and submit to your judgment," Steward Xu said, producing his identity jade slip to transfer Yingzui Island's ownership to Li Shiming.

Li Shiming watched in stunned silence. Elder Yu's decisive actions suggested prior knowledge of the entire affair—a terrifying display of intelligence-gathering. He wondered if his own secrets had escaped the sect leader's notice.

Uncle Zhuge sensed the undercurrents—Elder Yu knew more than he let on, seemingly waiting for Li Shiming's arrival.

Han Tianlei was taken away by the Law Enforcement Hall—this time as a prisoner. His punishment would follow a full investigation, but survival was impossible. He could only pray for a swift death rather than soul annihilation.

After thanking Uncle Zhuge, Li Shiming returned to Yingzui Island with a Law Enforcement Hall elder surnamed Xu.

Elder Xu first inspected the murder scene, meticulously recording all evidence.

"The sect leader has ordered this small-scale mountain-protecting formation as compensation from the Law Enforcement Hall. The original defensive formation will be reclaimed by the sect's grand formation," Elder Xu said after completing his tasks and removing the body.

Once Elder Xu left, Li Shiming stared incredulously at the storage pouch in his hand. The small-scale mountain-protecting formation wasn't a simple array disk but consisted of multiple formation flags and a spirit artifact as its core. This was merely the small version—medium and large versions required higher-grade materials and greater complexity. Such formations were typically reserved for protecting entire peaks or serving as a minor sect's guardian array.

Li Shiming retrieved a jade slip from the pouch, containing the formation's schematics. Normally, specialized formation masters would handle such setups, but as a qualified formation master himself—and given the need to minimize outside involvement—he undertook the task.

"Elder Yu is truly kind!" Li Shiming felt a surge of gratitude.

Unbeknownst to him, Elder Yu doubted Han Tianlei's involvement in the murder. The sect leader suspected an external sect's intrusion, given the victim was merely a junior herbalist hired by Han Tianlei to tend the spirit bamboo and fields—hardly a motive for murder.

Elder Yu deduced Li Shiming's connection to Yin Shilan—why else would the reclusive Yin Shilan intervene on his behalf? For Li Shiming's safety and as restitution for the Law Enforcement Hall's grave error, the formation was funded from the hall's public coffers.

---

Li Shiming spent an entire day setting up the small-scale mountain-protecting formation. Though theoretically sound, his practical experience was lacking. The complex process solidified his foundational knowledge and honed his skills—invaluable for future projects.

His progress wasn't slow. The setup required surveying Yingzui Island's terrain, spiritual energy distribution, magnetic fields, and more. Each adjustment enhanced the formation's efficacy.

At noon, he messaged Yin Shilan to inform her of his return.

Meanwhile, Yin Shilan checked her identity jade slip, her lips curling slightly upon seeing the message. She'd known of Li Shiming's return since his meeting with Elder Yu and had awaited his message. Glancing at her pocket watch, her earlier annoyance faded—he'd remembered their agreed-upon time.

"You're forgiven," she thought, replying to inquire about his journey.

Li Shiming avoided mentioning his troubles, instead regaling her with tales of Nanshan Country's customs. Both exercised restraint, ending their conversation at the appropriate time.

With the formation complete, Li Shiming had much to do. He integrated surveillance cameras into the array—their lack of spiritual energy fluctuations made them undetectable beneath the formation's cover. Four cameras monitored the island's interior and surroundings, ample for Yingzui Island's modest size.

Security ensured, he planned his next steps. Venturing into the underground space—untouched during his absence—he noted Steward Xu's failure to discover it. The space technically lay beyond Yingzui Island's boundaries. Extending the formation to include the overlying waters, he planned to build a dock—both as cover for the underground space and for future mundane shipments.

Catching two spirit fish, he reflected on his stagnant "Vajra Body Protection Art" progress during his travels. As he prepared fish soup, thoughts of Ren Fei'er—who loved his spirit cuisine—brought a smile. Retrieving his communication jade slip, he found it blinking incessantly with messages:

"Big Brother, are you back yet?"
"Big Brother, why so slow?"
"Jerk, did you throw away the jade slip?"
"Sorry for the tantrum earlier—a kitten annoyed me."
"I miss your stories."
...

The messages had started three days after their separation—likely when her family took her home. Li Shiming's delayed return, caused by the Han Tianlei affair and formation setup, had drawn her ire.

"Fei'er, I just finished handling matters. Guess what? When I returned, Yingzui Island was seized! Thankfully, Sect Leader Yu dealt with Han Tianlei—the island is officially mine now!" Li Shiming shared his recent events.

"That villain Han Tianlei is despicable! He mustn't go unpunished!" Ren Fei'er declared, united in indignation.

Their mutual condemnation of Han Tianlei stemmed from different grievances—Li Shiming's recent troubles and Ren Fei'er's near-abduction by the old monk Du Yuan—both traceable to Han Tianlei.

"Big Brother, I found records on refining corpses. Activate your jade slip's location—I'll send them now!" Ren Fei'er suddenly remembered something important.

Li Shiming checked his surroundings before activating the jade slip's positioning function aboveground. How would she transmit the records? Was she in the sect?

As he pondered, the formation alerted him to an intrusion. Donning his goggles, he saw a small bird bumping against the barrier.
