# Chapter 281: The Fruit of the Marriage Tree

Even the southern border in late autumn was touched by a chill, adding a touch of desolation to the suspended temple in the twilight.

After the Five Elements Realm closed, the demon clans did not leave.

In the main hall of the suspended temple, vegetarian dishes were surprisingly laid out, with all the demons present, their expressions varied.

Monk Huai Kong sat beneath the stone statue of the Buddha, his eyes lowered, neither joyful nor sorrowful.

He pressed his palms together and said:

"The mission of the suspended temple in the southern border was to protect the Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens. For thousands of years, flowers have bloomed and withered."

"Now that the karma has run its course, after this banquet, there will be no more suspended temple in the southern border."

Previously, the demons harbored some illusions, but Huai Kong's words were now unmistakably clear.

The Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens has always been able to recognize its master.

It was just that for thousands of years, no demon had been able to do so.

Countless gazes turned to the head seat.

Every demon king and great demon present was a figure who could command wind and rain in the southern border, yet sitting on the head seat was a young girl.

She had sat there as soon as she entered, so naturally...

Although the suspended temple never restrained the demon clans of the southern border, it was still a warning bell hanging over their heads. Now, the suspended temple was leaving.

But a Divine Beast Princess who wielded the Divine Jade had appeared.

Would she perhaps become the Empress of the Azure Phoenix in the future?

What would become of the future of the southern border?

However, the hall fell silent, and for a moment, no demon spoke up to ask.

She was too fitting for the title of 'Divine Princess'.

She was already extremely dazzling and detached from the world. After obtaining the Divine Jade, even the Azure Phoenix Clan Leader, Shang Qinqin, who sat beside her, seemed to lose her luster.

Her distant gaze seemed to form an invisible, tight guard around her, making it unclear how one could get close.

To be honest.

When the demons entered the main hall of the suspended temple, they all wanted to kowtow to her first.

So who would dare to actively ask her?

They could only whisper amongst themselves.

"By the way, what about Wu Mo?"

"Could it be that after failing to seize the Divine Jade, he was seriously injured and left in despair?"

"The鸣蛟 clans are gone too. Are they worried that the bird clans might harm them..."

"Ah, it's a pity. I just don't know how the battle between the two went."

"Wu Mo was also a rare talent, with a chance to wield the Divine Jade. But his luck was poor, and he just happened to meet her..."

Just as the great demon kings were whispering to each other, they were suddenly interrupted by a voice:

"That's not it."

"??"

The demons were stunned, only to see that the speaker was the Azure Phoenix Divine Princess.

"He didn't have bad luck, nor did he lose to me."

Ying Bing's tone was soft and calm, her gaze seeming to pass through the Buddha hall to some unknown place, yet as clear as her words.

"Then why did you end up with the Divine Jade..." a great demon asked curiously.

"He yielded it."

"????"

"The Divine Jade... half of it will always be his."

Ying Bing's gaze was still fixed on the outside, but she gently nodded her head, confirming once again that she had not misspoken.

The expressions of the demons in the hall became incredibly varied for a moment, but mostly they were bewildered.

The Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens!

The future Demon Venerable of the southern border!

He just gave it away like that?

There was no alcohol at the suspended temple's vegetarian banquet, so why did they feel like they had drunk too much upon hearing this! Was there really a demon who could give such a thing away?

But the Divine Princess's expression when she said this was like a Bodhisattva statue that had just learned the colors of spring.

If it was him...

"Wu Mo once said that he hoped the demon clans could unite..."

"Could it be that he is leading by example, telling us that there are no irreconcilable gaps in the world by yielding the Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens?"

"Hiss... He leaves after his work is done, not even wanting to accept the admiration of other demons. This is truly a noble demon, a demon who has risen above lowly interests."

"Wuuu, this King is about to shed a little pearl."

The demons present felt they had discovered the truth.

"From now on, the Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens will not belong only to the Azure Phoenix Clan."

---

Ying Bing gently touched the big-headed doll at her waist and said softly:

"I will have the Divine Jade visit every clan periodically. You may discuss the order among yourselves."

With that, she no longer looked at the various demon kings with their different expressions and stood up to leave.

Monk Huai Kong glanced at Shang Qinqin out of the corner of his eye and let out a soft sigh:

"For today's vegetarian meal, there is one more thing for all the benefactors to taste, the Hundred-Flavor Fruit. It represents the flower that bloomed and the fruit that was born in the suspended temple in the southern border."

As he spoke, he took out an object, a red, heart-shaped, unusual fruit.

Ying Bing did not even turn her head.

"This Hundred-Flavor Fruit is a treasure that the Marriage Tree has accumulated over thousands of years..."

*Whoosh—*

Monk Huai Kong was a bit taken aback as the Azure Phoenix Divine Princess, who had just left, suddenly returned.

Ying Bing looked at the old monk with a calm expression, her fair hand opened and raised.

Her eyes clearly wrote: "Give it to me, thank you."

"One per person, benefactor, please."

He had just picked up a fruit.

Ying Bing's other hand let go of the big-headed doll, making a 'two' gesture.

Monk Huai Kong: "..."

The Azure Phoenix Divine Princess left without taking a single cloud with her.

She only took two fruits.

"The order for the Divine Jade, how should we decide? The first should still go to the鸣蛟 clan, after all, that was Wu Mo's clan..."

"Let's eat first, I'll try this fruit."

"Tsk, it's so sour, a taste of sharp sarcasm."

"Yours?"

"Hiss... not spicy."

"Huh? I feel a warmth in my belly? This fruit seems to have some divine effect..."

.......

At the same time.

In the water clan's pocket dimension within the suspended temple.

The water clans were enjoying Chef Li's large pot meal. Little Li, the young flood dragon, stood on a giant clam shell, holding a spatula, using the power of the Primordial Chaos to stir-fry the ingredients inside over a high flame.

By himself, he was stir-frying the food in five or six giant clams, yet he still had energy to spare.

After finishing all of it, Murong Xiao acted as the waiter, and the water clans began to feast heartily.

"Boss Mo, it's too hard on you."

"No, it's... you've also worked hard."

Li Mo jumped down from the giant clam, watching the water clans start eating and drinking without a care in the world, and sighed inwardly.

Many water clans had worked hard in the Five Elements Realm, but in the end, they got nothing.

He, on the other hand, had achieved merit... *cough*.

If only the investment feedback could be issued now.

"大概是 because Ying Bing hasn't completely refined the Jade Phoenix God yet, so the feedback is delayed?"

"Among the rewards, aside from the others, the Gilded Creation Seal is definitely included..."

Li Mo's thoughts drifted, his mind soaring higher and higher.

Then he shook his head, telling himself in his heart not to be greedy and bite off more than he can chew.

He still had many divine artifacts that he hadn't fully utilized yet.

For example, the "Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao," for example, the "Scripture of Myriad Heavens and Stellar Mysterious Pills," and even the "Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body," which he had obtained at the very beginning, had not reached the point of being completely perfected.

There was no rush for the investment feedback, let Ying Bing take her time...

She had just obtained the Divine Jade, and she would definitely have some things to deal with regarding the demon clans...

"Do you eat fruit after a meal?"

"Huh?"

Little Li was so focused on his thoughts that he would subconsciously take whatever was given to him.

So he found himself holding a red fruit in his hand.

Like a heart.

...

PS: Damn it, whenever I write about Ying Bing, I can't help but add details, making it more delicate.

This little failure author is about to be困晕了, good night to you, my dear readers.

I've already thought about today's sleep-talking:
"Please charge me up~~~"
