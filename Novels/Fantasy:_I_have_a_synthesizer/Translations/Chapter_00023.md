**Chapter 23: Dust Settles, Prodigy Camp!**

The next day, as the sunlight gently spread across the land, the entire Heng City gradually awakened.

Su Yu awoke from a night of cultivation.

He exhaled, expelling a mouthful of stale air, and his eyes gradually brightened.

"In a few more days, I'll be able to take another Marrow Tempering Pill, and then I'll break through to the Blood Refinement Realm!"

The thought alone filled Su Yu with excitement. Just half a month ago, he was merely a junior who hadn't even stepped into the Martial Artist Realm. Yet in the blink of an eye, he was about to advance to the Blood Refinement Realm. One must understand, the Blood Refinement Realm was already considered a top-tier expert in Heng City. Even a powerful figure like Li Tianhe, the founder of a corporation, was only in the Blood Refinement Realm. And he, having reached such a height in less than half a month, had to admit, his speed was truly astonishing. Even when looking across the entire Great Xia Dynasty, Su Yu's cultivation speed could rank among the top ten.

"There are still two or three months until the Gaokao. I wonder if I can break through to the Organ Tempering Realm. If I can, perhaps I can aim for a national ranking!" Su Yu murmured.

The Gaokao was the annual grand event of the Great Xia Dynasty, where prodigies from across the nation would have their results judged to enter better martial arts academies. Only by doing so could they 'carp leap over the dragon's gate' – ascend to a higher status.

Su Yu nodded.

A moment later, under the arrangements of the Heng City Martial Artist Association, Su Yu and Bai Zhan boarded a black sedan and slowly drove out of Heng City.

Inside the car, Bai Zhan sat upright, his gaze fixed on Su Yu, his expression grave.

"Su Yu, before we head to the Prodigy Camp, there are some things I need to remind you about."

Hearing this, Su Yu's interest was piqued.

"The Prodigy Camp, as you know, is a training ground specially prepared by the Jiangnan Province Martial Artist Association for the prodigies participating in the Gaokao," Bai Zhan began. "Here, there won't just be geniuses from your graduating class, but also some students who are retaking the Gaokao! The geniuses from your class will probably have a cultivation level similar to yours, but you were born in Heng City, where resources are scarce, and you've only recently stepped into the Martial Artist Realm."

"So, even though you possess golden-tier potential, you're still a bit behind in terms of cultivation realm," Bai Zhan continued earnestly. "When you get there, it's best to adjust your mindset. Don't underestimate yourself just because you perceive yourself to be behind others."

This was also Bai Zhan's greatest concern. While Su Yu's talent was undeniably monstrous, in a small place like Heng City, resources were pitifully scarce. If Su Yu had been born in a major city like Kyoto or Modu, he might already be an Organ Tempering Realm expert by now. This was the gap created by resources.

Su Yu's brow twitched slightly. "Geniuses? Shouldn't true geniuses have already entered martial arts academies?" he asked, a hint of confusion in his tone.

Bai Zhan smiled and said, "How should I explain this? You know what the Gaokao is for, right? Martial arts academies! But there are also differences among martial arts academies. In some, the strongest expert might only be a Grandmaster, while others even have a King-tier expert overseeing them! So, different martial arts academies are indeed different. You must pay attention to this when you choose your academy later. A good martial arts academy can bring you terrifying improvements, while some lesser ones merely guide you onto the right path, perhaps even lacking sufficient resources to distribute."

Now, Su Yu understood. So, these retaking students are actually aiming for better martial arts academies, then.

At this moment, Bai Zhan continued. "Of course, that's just one reason. More importantly, this year's Gaokao is a little different!"
