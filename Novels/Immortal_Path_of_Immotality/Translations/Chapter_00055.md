# Chapter 55: Split Soul

The green-robed elder opened his gourd, releasing a swarm of gray moths—about fifty or sixty in total. 

The moths fluttered their wings slightly, scattering luminescent powder around them. The intricate patterns on their wings carried a subtle mystery that captivated everyone present.

"These Mistlight Moths of mine have been cultivated into spirit insects," the green-robed elder explained. "They can release gray mist to conceal one's form or scatter poisonous fluorescent powder. If inhaled by cultivators, it dissolves their spiritual energy."

As he spoke, he formed a hand seal, and the moths began flapping wildly. Wisps of gray mist emerged, shrouding the elder's figure. 

To the astonishment of the onlookers, while they could still see the elder with their eyes, their spiritual senses could no longer detect his presence!

The black-robed Daoist nun couldn't help but praise, "Fellow Daoist, these spirit insects are truly remarkable! To be able to conceal one's aura—this is a life-saving skill at critical moments!"

The hook-nosed man beside her snorted coldly, "Wouldn't they also be quite convenient for ambushes?"

Dispelling the mist, the green-robed elder waved his hand with a smile. "You flatter me. It's merely a petty trick. If I were to provoke a Foundation Establishment senior, their divine sense would easily see through it."

Lin Shan, however, kept praising the elder's modesty: "Being able to evade the spiritual perception of Qi Refinement cultivators is already extraordinary. What about their poison-releasing ability?"

"Patience," the elder chuckled before forming another seal. The gray moths fluttered again, releasing a shower of fluorescent powder that settled on the table.

He invited everyone to experience its effects firsthand.

Lin Shan glanced around first. Seeing that the black-robed nun and the hook-nosed man showed no fear—each taking a pinch of powder to sniff without any visible reaction—he followed suit.

The moment he inhaled, he felt a slight discomfort in his mind, and a fraction of his spiritual energy dissipated.

The black-robed nun spoke up, "Fellow Daoist, I suppose these insects would only be effective in large numbers? With just fifty or sixty, their poison might only work on early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators. You'd need hundreds to affect us."

Lin Shan and the hook-nosed man nodded slightly, then glanced at the yellow-robed immortal master and the veiled woman, who were also testing the powder.

The woman's face was hidden behind her veil, but the immortal master seemed intrigued.

Indeed, the yellow-robed immortal master was tempted!

These moths could conceal auras and release poison—exactly what he, who lacked such means, desperately needed.

The green-robed elder smirked. "These fifty-plus Mistlight Moths are newly cultivated and still unclaimed. For just twenty spirit stones, any fellow Daoist can purchase them, bind them with a drop of blood, and command them."

Then, with a meaningful glance at the immortal master, he added, "Though their toxicity is modest, their concealment abilities are extraordinary!"

The others saw through his ploy but remained silent. It was clear the elder was trying to fleece the immortal master—the weakest among them with no means of defense. Here was an opportunity—would he take it?

Twenty spirit stones for a gourd of insects was steep—enough to buy a low-grade magical artifact in the cultivation market. 

While their value couldn't compare to artifacts, the elder was banking on the immortal master's need for survival tools.

Following protocol, the elder collected the moths and passed the gourd around for inspection.

The other three showed no interest. Spirit insects required numbers to be effective, and this small swarm wasn't worth twenty stones—their poison only worked on early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators. Their concealment merely hid auras; one's physical form remained visible.

Unless used in heavy fog or dense forests, their utility was limited.

When the gourd reached Lin Shan, he examined one of the moths. As expected, the enhancement panel showed no reaction—living creatures were beyond its scope.

But the gourd itself triggered a response:

**[Insect-Control Gourd]  
Quality: Man-made  
Description: An ordinary gourd refined to house a small number of spirit insects (contains a hidden fragment of a soul).  
Enhancement Cost: 4 points**

Lin Shan's eyes narrowed. He had wondered how a simple gourd could contain spirit insects—now he knew it had been artificially refined. But what was this soul fragment?

He glanced at the green-robed elder, who had been watching him closely and responded with a knowing smile.

Was this old man scheming?

Lin Shan probed carefully but found nothing amiss. Yet the enhancement panel's warning was unmistakable. 

Was the elder setting up the immortal master? 

It made sense—the immortal master was the weakest and carried substantial wealth.

Lin Shan debated whether to intervene. After all, the immortal master was his ally—they'd need to rely on each other during the journey ahead, forming a subgroup within this circle.

But exposing the gourd's flaw publicly might provoke a confrontation with the elder. Worse, without proof, nobody would believe him.

Still, he decided to test the waters. Playing with the gourd, he remarked, "These spirit insects are quite intriguing. I might be interested."

He looked pointedly at the elder, whose expression stiffened. 

The elder had assumed only the immortal master—a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator—would be desperate enough to buy such a small swarm. He hadn't anticipated Lin Shan's interference.

Had the young man discovered something?

The elder briefly doubted himself but quickly dismissed the thought. His soul-splitting technique was sophisticated—only Foundation Establishment experts or above could detect it.

This brat was nothing but a troublemaker!

Suppressing his irritation, the elder forced a dry laugh. "Such a small number would hardly benefit mid-stage cultivators like us. They're better suited for Fellow Daoist Huang's protection."

But aside from the immortal master and the veiled woman, everyone present was sharp. 

If the elder merely sought profit, why insist on selling to the immortal master?

The black-robed nun and the hook-nosed man exchanged thoughtful looks.

Lin Shan, reading between the lines, suddenly burst into laughter—startling the elder—before passing the gourd along. 

(If asked, he'd say he learned this from Nightingale.)

After the inspection, despite his lingering doubts, the immortal master found no issues and ultimately made the purchase—to nobody's surprise.

Next, it was the veiled woman's turn. She produced a shimmering blue pearl, its interior rippling like water.

"A Water-Avoiding Pearl," her youthful voice rang clear, hinting at a beauty behind the veil. "A low-grade artifact that allows submersion up to ten meters and grants immunity to low-level water-based spells."

The others exchanged odd glances. 

Immunity to water spells? 

Wouldn't that render the black-robed nun's Water Arrow Talismans useless?
