# Chapter 8: Mid-Grade Talisman Master

After harvesting the spirit rice that day, Lu Xu didn't dare to spend the night outside as he used to. He immediately transported the spirit rice to the market city overnight, and the next day, Fatty Mo came and collected seven hundred catties. After selling off a portion of the spirit rice by going through the streets and alleys, Lu Xu's spirit stones increased to a hefty two hundred forty pieces.

"I still have one more replication chance this year. This time, I'll go directly for a mid-grade Talisman Master!" Lu Xu thought to himself. "I need to check out the Divine Talisman Hall!"

The number of mid-grade Talisman Masters in Qinghu Market City wasn't large, mainly found in the Divine Talisman Hall and the Mo family. Among rogue cultivators, there were only a scattered few, and their skill levels weren't very impressive. As for the Mo family's talisman masters, they were difficult to access. Thus, Lu Xu could only set his sights on the Divine Talisman Hall.

The next day.

"Divine Talisman Hall!" Lu Xu stood before the grand, imposing building, looking up at its plaque, a thoughtful expression in his eyes. This Divine Talisman Hall, along with the Hundred Herbs Pavilion, Thousand Mechanisms Hall, and Ten Thousand Spirits Tower, among several other large establishments, almost entirely monopolized the mid-to-high-end business in Qinghu Market City across various fields like pills, artifacts, talismans, and formations. Only the low-end market was left for ordinary cultivators. Even the Mo family couldn't compete with them. To be able to overshadow the Mo family on their own territory, these large establishments naturally had extraordinary backgrounds. It was rumored that a vast force spanning across various nations stood behind them, one that even the Thousandfold Extinction Sect, the hegemon of the Wei State, dared not easily provoke.

Before coming here, Lu Xu had already deposited one hundred spirit stones into the Azure Stone Tablet, fully prepared. Taking a few steps forward, as soon as he reached the entrance, someone immediately came forward to greet him:

"Fellow Daoist, what kind of talismans are you looking to buy? Our Divine Talisman Hall is absolutely the best talisman shop in Qinghu Market City; we can even provide first-grade high-grade talismans."

"I wish to see one of your Divine Talisman Hall's guest elders," Lu Xu replied. "I want him to assess whether I have the aptitude to join the Divine Talisman Hall!"

Upon hearing this, the attendant stopped in his tracks, his gaze sweeping over Lu Xu, and he asked seriously, "Fellow Daoist, do you truly wish to join the Divine Talisman Hall? I advise you to think it over carefully!"

"I have already considered it meticulously for a long time," Lu Xu said, his gaze firm and expression solemn, looking utterly resolute. "Fellow Daoist, there's no need to doubt my determination. Please, lead the way!"

Seeing this, the attendant secretly shook his head. He himself was an apprentice at the Divine Talisman Hall, currently in the stage of doing miscellaneous chores. In the future, he too would face experiences similar to old man Xu, being exploited by the Divine Talisman Hall just to acquire those precious Talisman Dao knowledge. He had lost count of how many times he had thought of escaping. The Divine Talisman Hall was like a besieged city: those inside wanted out, while those outside desperately tried to squeeze in.

However, to squeeze in, one first needed aptitude, for not just anyone could join the Divine Talisman Hall. Talisman Path aptitude was even rarer than cultivation aptitude!

"Follow me," the attendant said. He didn't offer further advice, leading Lu Xu into the Divine Talisman Hall, up to the second floor. After winding through the corridors a few times, they arrived at a small room. A gaunt-looking middle-aged man sat there, his long, unkempt hair hanging down to obscure his face.

"Master Du, another person wishes to join the hall. I've brought him over!" the attendant said respectfully.

The gaunt man lifted his head, and a hoarse voice spoke, "What's his name? What's his age and cultivation?"

"Junior Lu Xu, seventeen years old this year, at the second layer of Qi Refining!"

"Lu Xu?!" The attendant gasped upon hearing the name, then quickly leaned in and whispered into the gaunt man's ear. Lu Xu vaguely caught phrases like "Spirit Stone Loan." He ignored this, directly activating the Azure Stone Tablet on the gaunt man.

"Check Talisman Dao experience!"

After a green light flashed in his eyes, a line of text immediately appeared before him:

[First-grade Mid-grade Talisman Master: 12/100 (Triple)]

"What does 'Triple' mean?" Lu Xu felt a little surprised. Without time to ponder, he quickly activated the replication ability.

As the green light flashed, countless experiences surged forth from the middle-aged man, pouring into Lu Xu's mind like a long river. This knowledge was vastly greater than any Talisman Dao knowledge he had previously encountered, practically threatening to fill his entire brain. Lu Xu stood rooted to the spot, while the middle-aged man's brow had already furrowed deeply as the attendant continued his explanation.

A moment later, he slowly said, "Since you've already taken out a Spirit Stone Loan to learn talisman crafting, perhaps it's best you don't join our Divine Talisman Hall!"

The attendant secretly chuckled to himself. Someone like Lu Xu, burdened by a Spirit Stone Loan, was destined to have little "oil" left to squeeze out. Naturally, the Divine Talisman Hall wasn't willing to recruit him.

"Senior, please, can you make an exception? I will work very hard to craft talismans..."

"Take him out!" the middle-aged man said impatiently.

"Fellow Daoist, please," the attendant shook his head, gesturing for Lu Xu to leave.

Lu Xu, looking dejected, slowly shuffled out of the Divine Talisman Hall.

Once he was far from the grand building, his expression immediately returned to normal. "Good thing I have a reputation for taking out Spirit Stone Loans," he thought. "Otherwise, if they actually tested my Talisman Dao aptitude and found it suitable, it would have been troublesome to refuse the Divine Talisman Hall!"

His pretext for wanting to join the Divine Talisman Hall was merely because the guest elders of the Divine Talisman Hall were notoriously elusive, rarely showing their faces, making it difficult to meet them and replicate their experience. Thus, he had devised this method. If the Divine Talisman Hall had truly accepted him, Lu Xu would have had a headache instead.

Returning home, Lu Xu sat cross-legged and closed his eyes to introspect. Before him appeared the Azure Stone Tablet:

[Name: Lu Xu]
[Lifespan: 17/107]
[Cultivation: Qi Refining Layer 2]
[Spiritual Root: Wood (Lower-Mid Grade)]
[Cultivation Art: Azurewood Art (Beginner) 50/100]
[Replication Points: 64]

[Skills - Spells]:
Minor Cloud Rain Art (Beginner): 98/100
Geng Metal Sword (Beginner): 91/100
Sharpening Art (Beginner): 77/100

[Skills - Talisman Crafting]:
First-grade Low-grade Talisman Master: 44/100
First-grade Mid-grade Talisman Master: 12/100 (Triple)

To Lu Xu's pleasant surprise, this replication not only granted him the experience for crafting first-grade mid-grade talismans but also significantly boosted his experience for first-grade low-grade talismans. It had soared directly to forty percent proficiency. Upon closer thought, it made sense: higher-grade experience naturally encompassed lower-grade experience. Replicating higher-grade experience would thus cause lower-grade experience to increase automatically.

Seeing that the number of Replication Points on the panel had dwindled to 64, Lu Xu immediately understood: "Does 'Triple' mean the spirit stones required for replication have tripled?" Lu Xu wasn't surprised by this; higher-grade experience was naturally more expensive than lower-grade.

"From now on, I'll be a first-grade mid-grade Talisman Master. Hehe, if outsiders knew, I'd be quite a famous person in this market city!" Lu Xu thought to himself. However, he had no intention of making a name for himself.

After replicating this batch of experience, Lu Xu immediately began crafting talismans like mad. Of course, he couldn't neglect the care of his spirit fields either. However, after hearing about rogue cultivators from old man Zhang, he became extra vigilant about leaving the market city. Whenever he needed to tend to his spirit fields, he would try to go out at noon when there were more people around. He even arranged times with other spirit farmers so they could go out together and look out for each other.

And so, days passed.
