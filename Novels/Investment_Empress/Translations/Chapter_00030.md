# Chapter 30: The Trial Begins, Encountering the Demonic Cult Again

From the carriage, looking out, Beast Peak was already visible. Beast Peak was the last peak in the Azure Abyss Mountain Range, and also the closest to the wilderness. Ahead, a vast crowd was gathered, inner and outer sect disciples clearly segregated. Without exception, they were all new disciples who had not yet participated in the sect trial. The moment the Sect Master's carriage stopped, it instantly became the center of attention.

"Is that the Sect Master's true disciple, Ying Bing?"
"Hiss... that Junior Sister is breathtakingly beautiful."
"Keep your voice down. I heard she's already reached the eighth meridian of the Blood Qi Realm. Elder Qian Bufan's true disciple told me she even received a set of Black Cloud Gauze inner armor for it."
"How long has she been here? Eighth meridian? What a monster!"
"Surely no one can become the top scorer of the sect trial in their first year? That would be truly astounding."
"Who's that next to her?"
"That's True Disciple Li. He entered the sect with her."
"I know, True Disciple Li is such a good person!"

Hearing the other disciples' discussions, Li Mo's mouth twitched slightly. *Thanks, I don't usually seek recognition for good deeds, so there's no need to give me a 'good person card'.*

"Moon-Gazing Abyss, it seems to be deep within the trial grounds." Scanning the map, Li Mo found the place Ying Bing had agreed to meet. The deeper one went into the trial grounds, the stronger the exotic beasts became. Moon-Gazing Abyss was a remote location, and on the way, they would have to pass through the territories of many late-stage ninth-grade, even peak ninth-grade, exotic beasts. Without considerable skill, it would be impossible to venture there.

"One hour..." Li Mo looked at Ying Bing, who had walked to the forefront of the crowd, and secretly cheered himself on. *Don't underestimate us transmigrators; we're basically cheats!*

Suddenly, Li Mo noticed a familiar gaze fixed intently on him: Wang Hu. Wang Hu still wore his arrogant expression, but a sickly pallor between his brows made him appear gloomy and sinister. Meeting Li Mo's gaze, he slowly drew his hand across his throat, making a cut-throat gesture.

"What's gotten into this guy now?" Feeling speechless, Li Mo instinctively sensed that Wang Hu's state was off. A thought stirred in his mind, and his Heavenly Mandate Divine Eye swept over.

[Name: Wang Hu]
[Age: 16]
[Aptitude: Tiger's arms, leopard's waist.]
[Realm: Blood Qi Realm, Eighth Meridian.]
[Destiny: Black]
[Evaluation: Possesses some talent. With diligent practice, he might achieve something in the future. However, he is narrow-minded, vengeful, arrogant, and prone to extreme paths.]
[Recent Encounter: Deeply implanted beast seed, has strayed far down the wrong path. His own vital blood was no longer sufficient to sustain it; he was preparing to devour the blood of exotic beasts, gradually losing his sanity.]

"Beast seed?" Li Mo's brow subtly arched. What puzzled him wasn't Wang Hu's fate, but the fact that Wang Hu had come into contact with the Demonic Cult. Before the outer sect disciples' trial, unless they renounced the sect, they were not allowed to leave the mountain gate. If Wang Hu had been inside the Azure Abyss Sect all this time, where did this Demonic Cult's beast seed come from?

"This sect trial is probably not going to be ordinary." Li Mo mused for a moment. *Hmm, if everything was normal when the Daughter of Destiny was involved, then that would be abnormal. Following the usual tropes, 'Ice Block' should turn the tide, perhaps even pull off a desperate counterattack? But since I now knew...*

"Master!" Li Mo ran directly to where the elders were seated.

"Hmm?" Shang Wu had been napping. Hearing her disciple's voice, she drowsily scratched her hair. "Is it mealtime?"

"I'll treat Master to a meal after the trial is over. I have something to report." Li Mo spoke, relaying his assessment. However, he found a reason to cover up the Heavenly Mandate Divine Eye, attributing his discovery to something else.

When the three words 'Demonic Cult' came out of his mouth, Xue Jing and Qian Bufan instantly became serious, and even the drowsiness in Shang Wu's eyes vanished.

"Are you certain it's a Demonic Cultist? This is no laughing matter." Qian Bufan's voice was low, and a hint of worry was vaguely visible between his brows.

"My father serves as a county captain and once apprehended a Demonic Cult fiend. I merely felt a similar aura; I cannot be entirely certain. However, considering the gravity of the matter, I thought it best to report it to the elders. Even if it's a misjudgment, it's better than withholding information." Li Mo's words were reasonable.

"Little Mo is a careful and reliable person." Xue Jing pondered for a moment, then said, "There's a ninety percent chance that boy named Wang Hu has practiced the Demonic Cult's evil technique, the Hundred Beast Blood Refinement."

"Their claws have extended into my Azure Abyss Sect." Elder Yin Hua Xuan of Beast Peak abruptly stood up, as if preparing to apprehend Wang Hu and interrogate him thoroughly.

"Yin Hua, look at you, so impatient again." Xue Jing stopped him, a hint of satisfaction appearing in his gaze as he looked at Li Mo, saying, "We understand. You may return and participate in the trial. Proceed as normal, as if nothing has happened."

"Yes."
