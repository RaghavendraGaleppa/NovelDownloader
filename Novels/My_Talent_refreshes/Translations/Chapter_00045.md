# Chapter 45: Spirit Refinement Technique

Qi Chongmao's disappearance might draw the sect's attention, possibly even an investigation. But even so, Chu Ning never considered handing over Qi Chongmao's body to the sect.

If the sect thoroughly examined the details of their confrontation or inspected their storage bags, Chu Ning's little secrets would inevitably be exposed. Moreover, he was quite interested in the contents of Qi Chongmao's storage bag.

By now, Chu Ning had begun to piece things together. The so-called secret technique Qi Chongmao had used against him at the beginning was likely a spiritual attack. Normally, Qi Refinement stage cultivators couldn't cultivate spiritual sense, let alone use it for attacks—even if Qi Chongmao claimed to have reached the sixth level of Qi Refinement.

However, Chu Ning didn't have time to inspect the storage bag yet. The sect still sent patrolling disciples every night. Fortunately, their fight had been brief and probably went unnoticed. Still, he needed to tidy up the slightly messy battlefield.

After casting a few cleansing spells, Chu Ning scattered some iron vine seeds and used growth acceleration techniques to quickly cover parts of the disturbed soil. Only then did he pick up the black wooden sword he'd used to block the thorn technique and store it away. That sword had been crucial in maintaining his attack rhythm.

Now, Chu Ning finally had time to erase Qi Chongmao's spiritual imprint and open the storage bag.

"Supposedly sixth level Qi Refinement, yet so poor?" Chu Ning couldn't help but frown at the meager contents—just over forty spirit stones, fewer than he possessed. The amount barely covered the talismans he'd expended during the fight, including both offensive and defensive mid-grade ones.

Besides the stones, there were two talismans—one water-based attack talisman and another Swift Movement Talisman. "This Swift Movement Talisman is useful," Chu Ning mused. "Good for escaping or closing distance for my Heavenly Fist technique."

Next, he examined two pill bottles. The one labeled "Recovery Pills" contained ten pills, which he happily stored away. He'd obtained similar pills from Old Man Sun before—they were excellent for restoring spiritual energy and would pair well with his Heavenly Fist technique, which consumed nearly thirty percent of his energy in a single full-power strike.

The second bottle, labeled "Spirit Nourishment Pills," held only five pills. Unfamiliar with their effects, Chu Ning stored them for later inspection.

Finally, his gaze fell on two remaining items—a jade slip and an unidentified bamboo token. Remembering the secret technique Qi Chongmao had mentioned, Chu Ning's eyes gleamed as he pressed the jade slip to his forehead, absorbing its contents.

What he discovered left him both relieved and shaken. The slip contained a fragmentary secret technique called the Spirit Refinement Art—a method to cultivate spiritual sense that could be practiced even during mid-Qi Refinement stages.

The technique had four levels, each exponentially increasing spiritual sense: double at first level, quadruple at second, eightfold at third, and beyond sixteenfold at fourth. Unfortunately, only the first two levels were recorded.

The technique included two subsidiary arts—one to test innate spiritual sense strength, and another called Phantom Spirit Thorn, a spiritual attack that could temporarily disable an opponent's energy manipulation. The latter worked best after mastering the first level, and at higher levels could even erase an opponent's consciousness instantly.

However, the drawbacks were severe—using it with weak spiritual sense could cause self-harm, and attacking someone with stronger spiritual sense risked backlash.

Now Chu Ning understood what had happened with Qi Chongmao. Eager for a quick victory, Qi Chongmao had opened with Phantom Spirit Thorn, implying he'd practiced it for some time. The brief duration of its effect suggested either Qi Chongmao hadn't mastered the first level fully, or...

Chu Ning's eyes sparkled at another possibility—that his own innate spiritual sense was unusually strong. Though past experiences suggested his talents were mediocre, with neither his Wooden Tiger Spirit Body nor Talisman Origin Spirit Body enhancing spiritual sense, he decided to test anyway.

After fifteen minutes of meditation using the assessment method from the jade slip, Chu Ning opened his eyes, astonished. "My spiritual sense is nearly twice as strong as an ordinary Qi Refinement cultivator's!"

This explained why Qi Chongmao's attack had only briefly affected him. If Qi Chongmao's spiritual sense was average, even with partial mastery of the technique, it would barely surpass Chu Ning's natural strength.

"With this advantage, I must cultivate this technique," Chu Ning resolved, though he'd need to find the missing levels later. His growing list of incomplete techniques—the Wooden Longevity Art stopping at late Qi Refinement, the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Manual's first volume, and now this—reminded him to be cautious.

He vowed to use Phantom Spirit Thorn sparingly, uncertain of opponents' spiritual strength. Qi Chongmao's mistake—using it against someone with stronger innate sense—had cost him dearly. Without that miscalculation, his sixth-level cultivation and other techniques might have posed real trouble.
