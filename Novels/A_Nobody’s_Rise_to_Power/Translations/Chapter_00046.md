# Chapter 46: Crossing the River Under Cover of Darkness

The next morning, Yang Can brought Li Damu and Qingmei to find Zhang Yunyi.

Upon hearing Yang Can’s purpose, Zhang Yunyi naturally agreed readily.

"I, Zhang, act openly and honorably. I actually look forward to a thorough investigation to prove my innocence," Zhang Yunyi said with a hearty laugh. He immediately instructed the steward, Wan Tai, to summon the chief bookkeeper from the manor’s accounting office.

Yang Can added, "Although Misses Sangzhi and Xiaotan are meticulous and gentle, I have no need for attendants here. I ask the Manor Master to take them back."

Li Damu immediately started coughing loudly upon hearing this.

Zhang Yunyi glanced at Qingmei, assuming that this young lady was feeling jealous of Yang Can.

*Heh,* he thought. *The reason Director Yang is flirting with the Young Mistress’s little maid is probably because he offended the Suo family too severely before and now wants to ease relations with them indirectly.*

*In that case, Director Yang is the one who needs Qingmei. Naturally, he will do his best to please her.*

Thinking of this, Zhang Yunyi smiled and stroked his beard. "Since Director Yang doesn't need them, I shall simply call them back."

"Ahem... Cough, cough!" Li Damu coughed violently a few more times.

Zhang Yunyi looked at Li Damu and said, "Mr. Li, since you have to audit the accounts of Feng'an Manor for the past three years, it will surely be a laborious task. Why don't I select one of them to serve you tea and water and attend to your daily needs? How would that be?"

"Hahaha, Manor Master Zhang is truly thoughtful. Then this old man shall not decline. However, there is no need to choose. Miss Xiaotan will do just fine. Hahaha, just fine."

Li Damu couldn't wait to make the selection, picking the one he liked the most.

Hearing this, Zhang Yunyi thought it was exactly what he wanted.

Sangzhi was merely a concubine, an item Zhang Yunyi could trade in his eyes. But she had to be worth the price!

In Zhang Yunyi's eyes, Director Yang was worth the price of Sangzhi.

As for Xiaotan, she was just Sangzhi's personal maid. He had originally intended to assign Xiaotan to serve Li Damu anyway.

Thus, Zhang Yunyi smiled and agreed.

A short while later, Wan Tai brought the chief bookkeeper of the manor.

Manor Master Zhang gave his bookkeeper some instructions and had him take Mr. Li away.

Yang Can then said, "I, Yang, am not versed in accounting. The urgent matter has already been entrusted to Mr. Li. But I cannot sit idly by. Why don't I patrol the manor? Otherwise, if the news reaches the Clan Lord and the Young Mistress, it would be hard for me to explain myself."

Zhang Yunyi raised an eyebrow. "Would you like me to accompany you?"

Yang Can politely declined. "It is the height of spring plowing. There is no need for the Manor Master to accompany me. However, I do need a few people familiar with the manor's affairs to accompany me."

Yang Can knew that if he refused to let anyone accompany him, Zhang Yunyi would inevitably be suspicious.

His gaze swept over the group of stewards behind Zhang Yunyi.

Zhang Yunyi laughed. "Our Yu family places farming above all, and Feng'an Manor is primarily agricultural. How about this? Let the village head, Lai Gulun, and the field supervisor, Peng Jin, accompany Director Yang on his inspection."

The village head Lai Gulun and the field supervisor Peng Jin—one managing people and the other managing land—were perfectly suited.

Thus, Lai Gulun and Peng Jin accompanied Yang Can and Qingmei out of Feng'an Fortress.

No sooner had Yang Can left than a glimmer of suspicion appeared in Zhang Yunyi's eyes.

The manor's accounts were indeed to be checked; he had been mentally prepared for this. In fact, he couldn't possibly be physically prepared, because Second Master Yu had handed over the accounts too quickly.

But in any matter, the decisive factor is always people.

And regarding people, he had already "burned incense" for Yang Can. He had also put in a word for Chief Steward Li Youcai (Li Damu).

Logically speaking, he had already won over Yang Can. As for that Li Damu, he was even more confident.

But he feared the "new官上任三把火" (new official's three fires)—what if Yang Can's ambitions were too great?

Pondering this, Manor Master Zhang waved his hand and called Wan Tai to his side.

"Wan Tai, go give Lai Gulun and Peng Jin a few words of instruction. Tell them... to serve Director Yang carefully."

Wan Tai understood implicitly and nodded. "Rest assured, Master. I will go right away."

"Wait!"

Zhang Yunyi called him back, his gaze darkening, his expression becoming conflicted.

After a long while, Zhang Yunyi stroked his beard and said slowly, "Tell our men to be ready. If the situation becomes uncontrollable..."

Zhang Yunyi's hand followed his stroked beard down to his chest, the movement sharp and decisive, like a knife chopping down.

Even though Wan Tai had followed Zhang Yunyi since he was young and had done his share of dirty work, he couldn't help but be startled.

"Master, Director Yang is a man sent by the Clan Lord! If something happens to him at our manor... even if there is no evidence, we will not escape responsibility."

Zhang Yunyi sneered. "Is the responsibility greater than that 'Mountain Goods' affair of ours?"

Wan Tai was taken aback. Zhang Yunyi continued to comfort him, "As long as there is no evidence, even the Clan Lord cannot kill us. But if the Clan Lord finds out about that 'Mountain Goods' affair, you know the consequences."

Wan Tai gritted his teeth, a cold light flashing in his eyes. "You are right, Master. I know what to do!"

Qingmei accompanied Yang Can to look at the village artisan workshops and visited some villagers.

Then they walked around the water reservoir outside the village and finally came to a field of crisscrossing paths on the west side of the village.

Yang Can stood on the ridge, looking out at the farmers plowing the fields. The spring breeze brushed his face, refreshing his mind and spirit.

Suddenly, a fragrant breeze wafted over. He turned his head, and Qingmei's charming face, capable of looking both joyous and vexed, was right next to his.

"Hey, are we just going to wander around like this all day?" Qingmei asked.

Yang Can laughed in amazement. "What, are you tired already?"

Qingmei glanced back. Peng Jin and Lai Gulun were chatting under a tree.

She lowered her voice and said, "You said there was someone else to break the deadlock. Why are we working so hard? My feet are sore from walking."

As she spoke, she stretched out her foot.

Yang Can looked down. A deerskin boot peeked out from under her pomegranate skirt. Even just the shoe looked incredibly small.

Seeing Yang Can staring fixedly, Qingmei shyly retracted her foot under her skirt.

"Are you listening to me?" Qingmei coquettishly asked.

Yang Can spread his hands helplessly. "If we stayed inside Feng'an Fortress the whole time, wouldn't Manor Master Zhang be suspicious?"

Qingmei whined, "I know you have plenty of clever ideas. Think of something then."

Yang Can suddenly flashed a wicked grin. "Well, there is a way. For example..."

Looking at Yang Can's lustful eyes, Qingmei's face suddenly turned red like the elm-leaf plum blossoms on the ridges in spring.

"You beast! Do you want to die?" Qingmei extended her foot and "vigorously" stomped on Yang Can's foot.

Perhaps because her foot was so small, or perhaps because Qingmei was so light, the stomp didn't hurt at all. Instead, it made Yang Can's heart itch.

Regarding Suo Chanzhi, Yang Can had been like Zhu Bajie eating the ginseng fruit—he hadn't had time to savor it.

As for Pan Xiaowan, she was like a female demon wanting to eat the Tang Monk's flesh; she wanted to be eaten but was also afraid to be eaten, possessing a unique charm.

As for this little Qingmei, Yang Can didn't have the heart to devour her just yet. Wasn't this ambiguous exchange a beautiful feeling in itself?

The thawing time of the fields on the ridges is much later than that of the Central Plains. The sowing period here is generally about a month later than in the Central Plains.

At this time, the land on the Central Plains is already full of thriving green seedlings, but here, spring plowing has just begun.

On the vast and flat fields, there is a scene of busy farming. Self-sufficient farmers, military-retainer households, and tenant farmers of Feng'an Manor are plowing the land.

The plowed land presents a soft state, like yellow waves.

Unlike the black soil of Liaodong, which can squeeze out oil, the soil on the ridges is generally yellow or brownish yellow.

Although it is not black soil, this place is indeed the "Granary of Longyou," and can be considered fertile.

The black soil of Liaodong is naturally formed chernozem. It is formed by the slow decomposition of large amounts of organic matter in the soil and is "born" fertile.

The soil in the Hetao area relies on irrigation from the Long River. The Long River is rich in various biological nutrients, which makes up for the local soil's inherent deficiencies.

Cheng Dakuan, the Leopard Head, was currently working in the field. His father-in-law, Old Man Cheng, was holding the plow, and Mrs. Cheng was leading the ox.

Her two sons and several cousins of similar age were playing on the ridges. The little daughter was wrapped in a swaddling cloth, sleeping soundly on a clean tree root protruding from the ground under a large tree.

Cheng Dakuan is the eldest son of the Cheng family and the most promising child. He has six younger brothers and two younger sisters—this is the glorious result of Old Man Cheng's life.

Of Cheng Dakuan's six younger brothers, two died young. So now he has four younger brothers and two younger sisters. The whole family is self-sufficient farmers.

Compared to the tenant farmers, the Cheng family's life is certainly much better. But this "better" is only relative to the tenant farmers.

As the eldest brother and with the best family situation, Cheng Dakuan helps his younger brothers and sisters a lot. Otherwise, with his treatment as a Yu family steward, if he only supported his own small family, life would be much more affluent.

Next to the Cheng family's land, in a row, were the lands of his younger brothers and sisters. This large expanse of land belongs to the Cheng family.

The younger brothers' families had no oxen. If they all waited for the eldest brother's ox to be free, they might miss the farming season. So now they can only use people to pull the plow. If there are no strong laborers in the family, this backbreaking work is impossible to do.

Fortunately, Old Man Cheng's unique talent is not just in being able to father many children; his children are also much taller and stronger than ordinary people. The Cheng brothers are all broad-shouldered and brawny, with immense strength. So although pulling the plow is hard work, the Cheng family can manage it.

In the field, Second Brother Cheng and his sixteen-year-old eldest son, with hemp cloth pads on their shoulders, arched their backs and pushed with their legs, plowing the land like old yellow oxen. Sweat flowed down their cheeks onto their chests and backs, or dripped directly from their foreheads and chins into the soil.

Second Sister-in-law Cheng held the plow from behind. The family of three was plowing. The more land they plow now, the faster the remaining land can be plowed once the eldest brother's ox is free. That way, the other brothers' families can get help sooner.

Suddenly, a pair of hemp shoes appeared in front of Second Brother Cheng.

Second Brother Cheng looked up and saw half a face with whiskers like halberds under a bamboo hat.

Before even seeing the eyebrows and eyes clearly, Second Brother Cheng recognized the visitor.

He exclaimed in surprise, "Big Brother?"
