# Chapter 127: Hero of Salvation, Li Shaoxia, Master Han Falls into Thought

"My... my legs?"

Tie Qi felt an itch in his legs, as if a thousand ants were crawling over his body.

Yet he felt no pain, only stared in disbelief, afraid it was a hallucination.

Bones grew from his empty legs, and on the bones, meridians and flesh rapidly sprouted.

It felt as if he were in a dream.

But the clear sensation of pain reminded him that this was real.

Tie Qi suddenly remembered.

Last night, when drinking with this young man, the other party had said there was a way to cure him, to allow him to walk again.

He had thought the young man was just drunk and boasting.

But...

"Silent through all that? Old Tie is one tough man," Li Mo thought to himself, giving a thumbs-up.

"Brother Li, what is...?" Tie Qi's throat was dry.

"Body-Fusing Earth Pill," Li Mo answered casually.

These few words sent shockwaves through Tie Qi's heart.

He had longed to recover from his disability and naturally knew that the Body-Fusing Earth Pill was a medicinal pill refined from Body-Fusing Grass and many other rare treasures.

In fact, even if he found the Body-Fusing Grass, he didn't know how long he would have to save to afford the other rare ingredients and the cost of hiring an alchemist.

The effect was so potent, and the pill's纹数 (vein count/purity) was not low...

And that pill had just been swallowed by him in such a dramatic fashion, without him even knowing.

"Brother Li, such a precious medicinal pill, I don't know how I could ever repay you..."

"Old Tie, you don't seem like the type to be so sentimental," Li Mo waved his hand and teased, "You weren't acting like this last night after drinking."

They hadn't known each other for long.

But he felt Old Tie was straightforward and bold, a person worth befriending.

Besides, Li Mo didn't lose anything; in fact, he gained a lot.

Tie Qi stood up, his mouth twitching, tears welling in his tiger-like eyes: "For the恩情 (favor) of giving me a new life, if Brother Li ever has anything you need, I will go through fire and water for you, without hesitation."

"It's fine, let's deal with the immediate trouble first," Li Mo pointed not far away.

After the Infernal Fire burned the Tree Demon King to ashes, the dense mass of tree demons began to stir restlessly again.

Perhaps it was due to their low intelligence, or maybe they felt the earlier flames wouldn't appear again.

"Okay!" Tie Qi nodded vigorously, wiping away the tears he had shed for the first time in his life. "Brother Li, can you move aside?"

"Huh? No need, I'm not that weak, I don't need to hide to the side."

"No, you're stepping on my halberd handle."

"......"

Alright.

In the end, the two didn't fight side by side.

Tie Qi charged into the fray alone, wielding his great halberd, carrying a sense of catharsis, as if breaking through and being reborn, clearing away the blockage in his chest and seeing the sun after the clouds.

After being a cripple for so many years, it was time for him to vent properly.

Li Mo just watched quietly from the side, letting him slaughter through the tree demon horde.

There was an unexpected surprise.

Tie Qi broke through to a higher realm during the battle.

As for the Beast Tokens dropped by the tree demons, Tie Qi pushed them all into Li Mo's hands.

He had already achieved the goal of this trip, even far exceeding expectations, so he naturally had no reason to insist on ranking high.

"The Ice Cube is killing way too fast," Li Mo looked up at the sky and clicked his tongue.

The rankings above the sky had changed significantly.

He had一路 (all the way) slain Bone Beasts, plus the gift from Tie Qi, totaling 70 Beast Tokens, and had now risen to second place.

The Ice Cube... 118, far in the lead.

Even if it were over a hundred pigs, it would take a while to slaughter them all, right?

Hmm...

If Li Mo took out his hammer, he might not be slower than that.

But it's unnecessary; being in the top fifty is enough.

"Brother Li, where do you plan to go next?" Tie Qi looked as if he was ready to follow Li Mo's lead.

"Wait a moment," Li Mo took out his little notebook again.

He checked off Tie Qi's name on it, then looked at the next place he needed to go and quickly planned his route.

His investment route focused on primary targets, while conveniently helping secondary targets along the way.

Bad people?

He helps bad people too; if an investment is needed, he invests.

---

But as the saying goes, help someone to the end, send a Buddha to the west. Those extremely evil types are quite easy to send to Buddha, right?

After Li Mo finished "shearing the sheep," he would warmly send them to the west.

...

The two traveled onward.

"Regret! This place is too dangerous, is my Falling Leaf Palm going to meet its end here today...?"

"Demon, taste my sword!"

"Demon, taste my halberd!"

"You are... Senior Brother Li, Brother Tie Qi?"

A person was surrounded by a horde of bone snakes.

The two descended from the sky and saved him.

...

"Yao Beiqing! How can you bear the name of the White Horse Sword Hero, ambushing a friend to steal Beast Tokens?"

"In this秘境 (Secret Realm), who knows it was me? I will still be the hero!"

"I misjudged you!"

"To be honest, I've had my eye on your wife for a long time. I'll go 'take care' of her as your best friend, marry your wife, raise your kid, hehehe..."

The two descended from the sky.

"Hypocrite, take my..."

"Wait, hold on."

Li Mo fed a healing pill to the man who had just let out a hehehe laugh and ambushed his friend, and even helped the villain heal.

After the healing was done, he sent the other party to the west with a single sword strike.

Tie Qi and the saved person were both dumbfounded.

You... are you a living Bodhisattva or a living King of Hell?

It's hard to understand. In any case...

This is just too extravagant and inhumane!

...

The above are just two snippets.

In reality, Li Mo, with Tie Qi in tow, acted as the judge of the Secret Realm, chivalrously upholding justice, doing far more than just this.

Of course, the truly evil and wicked people who had to be killed were actually a minority.

People who have been through the struggles of the Jianghu aren't so black and white.

Those who survived the disasters mostly lost the will to continue exploring the Secret Realm. After all, people only understand a truth after experiencing life and death.

Living is more important than anything else.

And the danger of this Secret Realm far exceeded their imagination.

Many who were advised did as Li Mo suggested, going to a certain safe place to lie low.

Hmm... that would be the Tree Demon Forest where no tree demons exist anymore.

After running into each other, they were inevitably surprised.

"You were... saved by Young Hero Li?"

"You too?"

"What a coincidence, me too."

"So... everyone here owes Young Hero Li a life-saving favor?"

"He didn't just save my life, he even saw that I was先天阉人 (naturally castrated) and gave me a Black Tiger Yang-Strengthening Pill. Alas, he is practically my reborn parent!"

"Ah, this..."

"Yeah! If it weren't for Young Hero Li, my son would have had to change his surname!"

The rescued people looked at each other, speechless, their hearts filled only with emotion.

Young Hero Li, he is truly... I could cry for him.

He is a person of noble character and integrity!

No, that can't even describe him.

He is the embodiment of justice!

Some were already discussing erecting a 生祠 (living shrine) and building a temple for Young Hero Li after they got out.

"It's not that the Buddha isn't worth worshipping, but worshipping Young Hero Li is more cost-effective!"

"That's right! When there's trouble, he really steps up! When there's a need, he really helps!"

"If anyone opposes Young Hero Li in the future, I will be their sworn enemy!"

"If a villain opposes Young Hero Li, it means that person is utterly wicked, and Young Hero Li is right to kill them!"

"If a good person opposes Young Hero Li, it means that person is a hypocrite with a double face! Young Hero Li is right to kill them!"

...

As more and more people were saved.

The rhythm seemed to become a bit strange.

That's not the point.

The important thing is that the atmosphere throughout the entire Secret Realm has become harmonious and friendly.

On the other side.

Deep within the Secret Realm.

Master Han, dressed in blood-red robes, always looking as if he holds all the cards and is unfathomably deep, fell into thought.

By his calculations.

The Secret Realm should have been a scene of blood and rain by now.

But...

"Why have so few people died?"
