**Chapter 210: Radiant Across an Era**

Under the twilight, the small town was bathed in a faint red mist.

Qin Ming was in a trance. He had heard of people walking on two boats, but never heard of treading two paths.

One was the Demonic Path, drawn out by fragmented demonic seeds. This time, he didn't thoroughly refine them with the tattered cloth, precisely to avoid being unable to resonate with this small path.

The other path was drawn out by his own overflowing Heavenly Light Energy, which was like pure Yang. This path was extraordinarily magnificent, seemingly paved with shattered great suns, with golden rays like flames.

He should logically walk this path, but with multiple demonic seeds, there were multiple paths. Why choose only one?

Moreover, the Demonic Path and the New Path also shared some commonalities.

Although he wanted to grasp both, there was one point: the two paths were under different feet. How could he proceed? Should he "split his legs" to walk?

Qin Ming actually tried it and immediately gave up. Not only was it awkward, but he couldn't walk fast at all.

He pondered for a moment. First, he concealed the demonic seeds with the tattered cloth, and then prevented the Heavenly Light from overflowing. After several attempts, he discovered he could control which path to take.

Furthermore, he could switch paths mid-journey.

He even continuously adjusted, allowing only a portion of Heavenly Light Energy to overflow while fully releasing the aura of the three fragmented demonic seeds. This allowed both paths to appear simultaneously and even overlap.

"This is not bad; I won't miss the scenery of any path," Qin Ming was very satisfied.

He tried multiple times, gazing ahead, and could see the scenery of both paths.

Most importantly, if needed, he could change his state and switch paths at any time.

Qin Ming wrapped his saber and bow, carrying them on his back. Then, his bones crackled as he activated the "Dragon-Serpent Transformation."

This was one of the methods of the sixth extraordinary technique. His physical body transformed, supplemented by "Blending Light with Dust," making it a perfect match.

He was ostensibly taking the Demonic Path, so he naturally needed to look more like a demon, also for convenience.

In an instant, Qin Ming's body became robust, his face sharply chiseled, with distinct features, quite heroic. He looked like someone who tolerated no nonsense.

His black hair was disheveled, and his eyes were as sharp as blades, exceptionally piercing. Even when standing still, he exuded the oppressive aura of an ancient beast.

"I am the Demonic Emperor? Forget it, let's keep a low profile. My name is Demon One." Qin Ming set off, immediately sprinting forward.

The path beneath his feet was churning with crimson mist, accompanied by wisps of purple qi. Under the cover of demonic clouds, the New Path was very blurry and temporarily hidden.

"Once truly on the path, looking at others' paths isn't as clear anymore," he gazed into the distance.

The Demonic Path, at times, was in the real world, and at other times, it seemed to enter a void-like place, as if foreign realms and secret realms merged. This path wandered between two worlds.

Along the way, dense forests were scattered, and mountains undulated. Qin Ming disappeared into the mountain bodies several times, vanishing directly, because the path beneath his feet passed through them, as if he temporarily entered another realm.

Soon after, he reappeared outside a large mountain in reality.

Before long, Qin Ming arrived at a "scenic spot."

A magnificent hall stretched before him, with surging crimson firelight. Inside, hot waves rolled, making one feel as if their body would burn even from a distance.

There was a plaque on the hall, written in demonic script, which Qin Ming couldn't understand at all. However, there was a certain imprint that activated as he approached.

He immediately understood what this place was.

Demonic Flame Hall, where one could refine the demonic body and enhance fleshly strength. This was a very painful tempering, but it offered immense benefits to the demon race.

Qin Ming stood still for a moment, then walked forward.

Just as he was about to step over the threshold, the demonic flames throughout the hall suddenly boiled.

"According to the Heavenly Demon Mirror's illumination, a descendant with aspirations to forge a path, having reached this place in the first realm, is undoubtedly of unparalleled brilliance for an era. However, the demonic seeds in his body are severely damaged, so he might not be able to pass through the Demonic Flame Hall."

Within this hall, a somewhat mechanical "voice" sounded, cold and devoid of emotion, reverberating in Qin Ming's mind.

He abruptly stopped, involuntarily inhaling a breath of fiendish fire aura.

Was there a demonic presence monitoring here? No, this was more like a legendary top-tier exotic treasure.

This short passage provided Qin Ming with some valuable information.

Only those who could embark on a path were considered to have aspirations?

He gave a wry smile. In truth, who hadn't harbored grand ideals in their heart? However, many people simply couldn't resonate with such mysterious small paths.

Ultimately, aspiring to great heights required extraordinary talent, inherently blocking ordinary people.

"There's even a Heavenly Demon Mirror hanging here. Who set this up?" Qin Ming mused.

Clearly, the other party detected his fragmented demonic seeds and recognized his demonic identity. It wasn't that "intelligent," so he could completely bluff his way through.

Qin Ming was certain that this couldn't have been set up by the Immortal Path or Secret Sect people; this area had only recently been conquered.

Moreover, here, Immortal Seeds, Demonic Seeds, Divine Seeds, etc., could all embark on a path. So, it shouldn't have been set up by that group of old demons on the plateau either.

"A Secret Realm is a fragment of a planet from beyond this world, this..." He couldn't help but fall into a daze upon closer thought.

However, he shook his head again. It shouldn't be that outlandish.

He had long heard that Kunling belonged to a legendary land. In ancient times, various anomalous creatures appeared there, not lacking god-like beings.

"No wonder I saw Sun Taichu's illusory figure. A place linked to myths and legends like this must hold immense appeal for him."

Qin Ming smiled. In such a place, he had received the evaluation of "radiant across an era," which was undeniably high.

He entered the Demonic Flame Hall. Instantly, wisps of runes lit up within the firelight, and the entire hall was engulfed in swirling firelight, which surprisingly resembled intertwining lightning.

It didn't burn his clothes; instead, it poured in from above, surging out from beneath his feet. Layer after layer of demonic flames, like falling waterfalls, cleansed every inch of his flesh and blood.

Qin Ming felt nothing; it was not even as potent as his Li Fire Energy.

Soon, the demonic flames changed from crimson to purple, mixing with demonic qi, continuously pouring in and "washing" his limbs and bones. The firelight grew more intense, and its strength increased.

Qin Ming realized that this was actually a primitive form of Heavenly Light Energy, not actual flames.

Eventually, he felt sharp pain. After all, this was passive "endurance," not a true confrontation.

In fact, later on, even his body began to tremble.

"A descendant with aspirations to forge a path, you have endured the strongest demonic flames' baptism in the first realm. During the process... your physique improved negligibly. Your physique is astonishing; a Heavenly Demon can be expected in the future, destined to establish a sect!" The cold evaluation voice sounded again.

Qin Ming carefully contemplated; his physical body showed no unusual changes after such cleansing.

He passed through the Demonic Flame Hall, wanting to say: "Is that all?"

Because, here, it didn't feel like he had undergone a "tempering."

"Highest local evaluation: the path beneath your feet can be expanded to five fingers wide." The mechanical voice sounded again.

Qin Ming was stunned. What was the use of that? Immediately, he saw that the Demonic Path beneath his feet had indeed widened a bit.

At this moment, he saw the blurry scenery on the other path: a tall platform, like a place for sacrificing to the heavens.

Qin Ming decisively switched paths. In an instant, he stepped onto the New Path paved with golden rays and rushed forward, ascending the stone platform standing amidst the clouds.

"A descendant with aspirations to forge a path, based on your physique and the circulating Heavenly Light, you will undergo optimal tempering."

Qin Ming realized that this place could provide targeted arrangements for various paths.

In fact, the early stages of the New Path and the Demonic Path had similarities.

The next moment, after he stood on the high platform, brilliant light suddenly descended from the sky. It was Heavenly Light illuminating everything, still pouring in from above.

"In the first realm, your physique no longer requires tempering and cannot be further enhanced."

Qin Ming frowned. Was he going to make a wasted trip? This was meaningless to him. Did this path only extend this far?

Ultimately, he also received the highest evaluation on this path, and the path beneath his feet widened.

Qin Ming returned to the Demonic Path. When he saw the new scenery ahead, he finally smiled, thinking, "Surely, this time he wouldn't return empty-handed?"

Because, from a distance, he could hear dragon roars. It was a giant palace where dragons and serpents intertwined.

"Is this related to scriptures?" Qin Ming was delighted; he actually grasped the true meaning of the Dragon-Serpent Scripture.

As he neared the place, he saw a dragon and a serpent rush out, exuding an extremely primitive, wild aura that enveloped everything, extraordinarily violent.

They immediately unleashed a killer move from the Dragon-Serpent Scripture—the Dragon-Serpent Combined Attack.

Moreover, this was somewhat different from what Qin Ming practiced, more like a demonic technique.

He immediately counterattacked, also using the same move, with black and white light rising from his left and right hands.

On the other side, the dragon soared through the sky, carrying lightning, embodying ultimate rigidity and pure yang. The serpent coiled on the ground, wrapped in yin mist. Both rushed together, attacking Qin Ming in the middle.

In an instant, lightning flashed and thunder roared, dragons flew and serpents danced, a truly astonishing sight.

Qin Ming defeated the dragon and serpent. However, more dragons and serpents rushed out from the giant palace. All were techniques from the Dragon-Serpent Scripture, forming tangible bodies, fiercely assaulting him.

Subsequently, the area became densely packed as dragon and serpent shadows continuously increased. This was tempering his understanding of the Dragon-Serpent Scripture.

If he didn't fall, it seemed the dragon and serpent shadows wouldn't disappear.

A voice sounded, saying, "A descendant with aspirations to forge a path, this place is the Enlightenment Combat Palace. You are fighting yourself, thereby comprehending deeper scriptural meanings."

Then, it spoke again: "According to the detection, the original demonic version of the Dragon-Serpent Scripture is present here, and it is performing its techniques for you."

Qin Ming understood why these dragon-serpent illusory figures displayed somewhat different techniques.

By the end, he was very fatigued because he was fighting himself. Many dragon-serpent illusory figures were reflections from his own mind, to the extent that later, blood even stained the corners of his mouth.

Until all the dragons and serpents dispersed, he gasped for breath, carefully replaying the events. Indeed, he had gained a new understanding of this scripture.

At the same time, the Enlightenment Combat Palace glowed, and he felt as if he was soaking in a hot spring. His minor injuries quickly healed.

Before long, the scene here changed. Dense golden silkworms appeared. Another extraordinary technique, the "Golden Silkworm Scripture," had its true meaning displayed. Could it also be related to the demon race? Qin Ming was surprised.

However, as he fiercely battled here, he realized that this was again a scripture supplemented by this place, very different from the "Golden Silkworm Scripture" originally practiced by humans.

Because the version he practiced had no relation to silkworms; it primarily embodied the "metal" domain among the five elements.

Ultimately, he again received the highest evaluation here.

Soon after, upon returning to the New Path, he encountered a divine temple. A series of intense battles ensued, corresponding to the Wu Ji Scripture, Heluo Scripture, Yi Wood Scripture, and Li Fire Scripture.

Later, the Dragon-Serpent Scripture and Golden Silkworm Scripture also manifested again.

He instantly understood: the six great extraordinary techniques he had mastered were all manifested here, allowing him to re-comprehend and consolidate them.

"This time, the gains were quite substantial, especially the Demonic Path, which actually offered some supplements to the Dragon-Serpent Scripture and Golden Silkworm Scripture!"

Qin Ming continued on his journey. In a plaza, he saw some standing statues. Although blurry, he could recognize some people.

He immediately saw Li Qingxu, dressed in feathered robes, holding a bamboo stick.

"What is the meaning of this?" Qin Ming couldn't resist, and slapped it!

***

Kunling City. Cao Qianqiu's eldest disciple sat calmly, smiling and drinking tea with a friend.

"Your junior brother, Li Qingxu, must have also embarked on that path."

"Yes, my teacher places great hopes on him. His physical problems caused by practicing special cultivation methods have now been remedied by dragon blood. In the future, he can hope to be near immortal, perhaps becoming a radiance that dazzles an era."
