Chapter 232: A Shift in Attitude and a Turn of Fortune

The wilderness was dense with flourishing trees. Dappled light filtered through the canopy, and a stream gurgled softly nearby. The two figures by the stream fell silent for a long while, their situation and attitudes having completely changed.

Wen Caishang felt utterly unaccustomed to this. The Ancestral Silkworm had been taken from her, leaving her with no more trump cards, and her heart itched with anxiety. Li Xian helped Wen Caishang up and smiled. "Madam, you are reasonable and understanding. I, Li Xian, admire you for it."

Wen Caishang cursed, "Vile servant!" She was filled with indignation, her expression a mix of anger and grievance, yet incredibly alluring. "You only know how to bully me. I can't even move right now; I don't know how much more humiliation I'll have to suffer from you."

"I wouldn't dare," Li Xian said. "With a beauty like you, Madam, I should be protecting you, not bullying you." Though he said this, he was still audacious, playfully teasing Wen Caishang for a while.

Their relationship had quietly been restructured. Wen Caishang, both angry and embarrassed, said, "You bastard! You're such a wicked brat!" She gave him a fierce glare.

She thought of her many misfortunes and experiences. In the end... she hadn't fallen into the hands of her enemies but had first been brought low by this young man. Her past glory had turned into a moment of embarrassment, and she couldn't bear to face it.

"Madam, let me clean your wounds first," Li Xian said. He helped Wen Caishang to the stream and removed her white dress.

Wen Caishang's face flushed red. The situation dictated her state of mind. Seeing Li Xian clean her wounds so meticulously and tenderly, his handsome features striking, she was deeply moved. "What Li Xian said is true. He doesn't owe me anything; it is I who have schemed against him most."

Wen Caishang had four wounds: her shoulders were bruised purple, and there were bloody gashes on her left leg and right arm. Ordinary external injuries healed very quickly and were already showing signs of closing. However, the internal injury remained in her body, difficult to expel.

Li Xian carefully and gently washed away the dirt and blood from her wounds. He helped Wen Caishang put her clothes back on and looked around. Seeing a vine hanging from a tree, he pulled it down and rubbed it between his hands to soften it.

He lifted Wen Caishang onto his back and tied the vine around his waist. He bounced up and down a few times and asked, "Madam, is it tight?" Wen Caishang nodded. "You certainly have your clever little tricks."

Li Xian laughed. "Madam, have you forgotten? I was born a hunter. It's just..."

"Just what?" Wen Caishang asked.

Li Xian said mysteriously, "It's just... ah, never mind. It's better not to talk about this."

"You!" Wen Caishang fumed. "Tell me right now."

"Are you sure you want to know?" Wen Caishang was exasperated. "I order you to tell me this instant, you vile servant!"

Li Xian said, "Since you call me a vile servant, then I am a vile servant. And since I'm a vile servant... naturally, I don't have to obey orders."

Wen Caishang gritted her silver teeth, fuming with rage. This scoundrel was showing his true colors and was truly in need of a lesson. Li Xian said, "Unless..."

"Unless what?" Wen Caishang asked. Li Xian replied, "You used to stab me with your sword as punishment. Now... since you can't hold a sword to stab me, you could kiss me instead, and then I'll tell you."

He was by nature romantic and unrestrained, and therefore audacious and lawless. He said it casually, not taking it seriously, and then continued walking with his head down.

Wen Caishang's face turned crimson. In the past, she had treated Li Xian as her own property, and kissing and hugging him had been a habit. But this "offering of a kiss" felt different. Wen Caishang's mind churned, unsure if she was willing or not. But she suddenly thought, "There are pursuers behind us. Perhaps Li Xian and I will never escape this ordeal. Why think so much?"

She kissed his cheek and said shyly, "What were you about to say? Hurry up and tell me. I've kissed you, so if you don't tell me now, I'll bite your ear off!"

Li Xian was stunned. He suddenly felt that although Wen Caishang no longer had her former air of being fair and composed, she had become much more lively and distinct. Li Xian smiled. "Alright, I'll tell you."

"Madam, have you noticed that with you tied to me like this, whether I'm climbing a slope or going down a ditch, it's very stable. I haven't thrown you off at all."

The barren mountains had no paths, overgrown with weeds and debris, and were full of strange rocks and pits. Every step was extremely strenuous. Wen Caishang said in surprise, "That's true."

"Of course," Li Xian said. "It's because... when I used to go hunting in the mountains, tigers were incredibly fierce. The wooden arrows I made myself sometimes had the wrong angle and couldn't even pierce a tiger's hide."

Wen Caishang listened, captivated. "And then?"

"So," Li Xian said, "unless I was short on money, I wouldn't risk hunting tigers. Nine out of ten times I went into the mountains, I was hunting wild boars. Those things are stinky, cunning, and have thick hides."

"But they're numerous. Usually... when I went out to hunt wild boars, I almost never came back empty-handed."

"That's true," Wen Caishang said. "When we were hunting on Xiong Hu Mountain, wild boars were rampant. I was too lazy to shoot them."

"When I, a mountain hunter, go hunting, I don't have a meat bag to carry things in. After killing a boar each time, I could only carry it on my back. But wild boars are heavy. How do you carry them?"

"I saw my father struggle to carry them. On muddy, pitted roads, he'd often slip and fall. So I thought of a way: use materials on the spot, and pull down vines from the forest."

"First, twist them three times to the left, seven times to the right... slowly, the vines become soft. Then I use a vine to tie it around my waist, thread it through the boar's legs, wrap it around the boar's body, and finally tighten it..."

"Hehe, no matter how much I jump around, the wild boar is stuck firmly to my back and can't be shaken off."

"You're quite clever," Wen Caishang nodded, then suddenly froze and cursed with a pout, "Ah! You went through such a long story just to compare me to a wild boar!"

"Hahaha," Li Xian laughed.

Wen Caishang was furious. "See if I don't bite your ear off!" She craned her neck to bite him. Li Xian, feeling the pain, shouted as he climbed the mountain, "Mercy, Madam, have mercy!"

"You're too hateful; I can't let you off easily," Wen Caishang fumed. "How dare you compare me to a wild boar, hmph!" But after a moment of anger, she reflected on it and found that this feeling was something she had never experienced before.

A subtle sweetness began to spread through her heart.

"I've never seen a hunter raise such a wicked creature," Wen Caishang cursed.

"Have you seen one now?" Li Xian asked.

Wen Caishang said with a captivating air, "Not only have I seen one, but I've also been bullied by him."

"Who! Who dares to bully the Madam? I, Li Xian, will be the first to fight them to the death!" Li Xian declared righteously.

"A thief crying 'stop thief'—not a bit honest," Wen Caishang laughed and scolded.

Li Xian was free-spirited and his words were amusing. In the midst of finding joy in hardship, he made Wen Caishang completely forget their predicament. The two walked through the wilderness, with no one around, their conversation more intimate than ever.

Night fell.

After a long trek, Li Xian finally found a decent-looking cave. It was dark inside, but the feng shui was good. There was a natural stone bench, perfect for resting.

"Here comes the wild boar," Li Xian said. He untied the vine and set Wen Caishang down. Wen Caishang said angrily, "How dare you tease me again!" She bit Li Xian's shoulder, but without any real force.

There was a stone bench in the cave. Wen Caishang sat on it, leaning against the stone wall, barely able to sit up.

Li Xian started a fire and roasted some meat, the aroma filling the air. Wen Caishang asked, "You vile servant, have you thought of a way to escape?"

Li Xian shook his head. "Not yet, but I promise I won't leave you behind."

"Easy to say," Wen Caishang retorted. The firelight illuminated her; it was hard to tell if it was the glow of the flames or a blush on her face, but she looked quite pretty.

"What's the plan for next?" Wen Caishang asked.

"The world is vast; there's always a path," Li Xian said. He took out a map to check the terrain. Seeing that they had reached the edge of the map, he said, "Before we continue our escape, we need to figure out the terrain. Right now... we need to get a new map."

"To get a map, we have to enter a city. The city is full of spies; it won't be easy," Wen Caishang said with a furrowed brow.

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Li Xian said. At this point, they both felt a heavy weight in their hearts. They knew they were in grave danger, and whether they could escape was unpredictable.

Li Xian roasted a rabbit, shredded the meat, and fed it to Wen Caishang. Her eyes shimmered, and she suddenly asked, "Li Xian, if you were to die because of this, would you blame me?"

Li Xian smiled. "Madam, why are you being so gloomy too?"

"Hmph," Wen Caishang turned her head away. She had always been dominant, treating others with harshness and arrogance. Combined with her high martial prowess, her true nature had never been revealed. Now, with her strength gone, she felt helpless and reverted to her true self, her thoughts becoming more and more numerous.

After eating and drinking their fill, Li Xian helped Wen Caishang lie down. Wen Caishang had been struck by the "Bone-Setting Finger," her bones rigid and her tendons knotted, making it difficult to move. Although she knew the method to undo the finger technique, her internal energy was completely depleted.

A martial artist's internal energy, when rested and nourished, can slowly recover and grow. However, the "Energy-Devouring Gu" was lodged in her energy lake, constantly sucking away. Therefore, Wen Caishang's energy lake was depleted and could not be replenished.

She had a deep understanding of martial principles. Since the righteous path was difficult, she turned to a devious one. She had Li Xian lay her on her stomach and used techniques on her back, applying energy and massage to stimulate her bones and relax her tendons.

It was effective. After an hour of effort, Wen Caishang could move her fingers. She predicted, "At this rate, in a few more days, I'll be able to walk without issue."

"If I persist with the massage daily, I might even be able to use sword techniques. But a devious path is still a devious path. The energy of the Bone-Setting Finger is difficult to completely dissolve, and my strength will be hard to recover."

Still, there was a glimmer of hope.

The sky darkened. Li Xian gently patted Wen Caishang's back to help her sleep peacefully. He, on the other hand, practiced his leg techniques in the cave, never letting up.

[Through a thousand dangers and ten thousand obstacles, my heart remains firm. Profound Leg proficiency +26]
[Even if the sky falls and the earth crumbles, I remain calm. Profound Leg proficiency +28]

Li Xian's "Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword" was nearing perfection in its first and second layers. However, the urgent task was to increase his leg strength and speed. Therefore, he focused on practicing the Profound Leg.

Every kick he threw brought progress.

[Profound Leg]
[Proficiency: 13598/20000 (Perfected)]

The slanted moon shone into the cave.

Wen Caishang suddenly said, "Among the martial arts of the world, some leg techniques can increase foot speed, but they can't compare to 'lightness skill' in the end."

"I have many lightness skills, and their quality is not bad. But unfortunately, I can't move. I can only guide you with words. Are you willing to listen?"

Li Xian was delighted. "Please speak, Madam."

Wen Caishang said with a captivating mix of charm and annoyance, "So respectful all of a sudden? Hmph, I was planning to teach you straightforwardly, but now you annoy me. You have to serve me until I'm not angry anymore, then I'll teach you."

As soon as the words left her mouth, she was startled. She wondered when she had started speaking in such a tone.

Li Xian said playfully, "Rest assured, Madam." He was both massaging her back, rubbing her shoulders, and kneading her legs. He said nothing but pleasant things, making her feel as if she were floating on air.

Wen Caishang sighed. "Ah, I've really been fooled by you. Look at you now; there's not a trace of the man from the manor left. You're audacious enough to bully your master."

"Alright, I'll teach you the lightness skill. I will speak, and you will listen. How much you can grasp depends on your understanding."

"First, go outside and see if there are any stars."

Li Xian said, "There are."

Wen Caishang said, "Good. I will teach you the Seven Stars Steps, a rare lightness skill that can be learned quickly. The Seven Stars Steps correspond to the 'Big Dipper' in the sky, namely: Tianshu, Tianxuan, Tianji, Tianquan, Yuheng, Kaiyang, and Yaoguang."

"Go outside, find a place where you can see the stars, and practice as I tell you. If you can master the basics in one night, combined with your quite good Breeze Leg and Profound Leg... your speed can reach another level."
