Chapter 71: The Thunderfire Alchemical Palace

Inside the Thunderfire Alchemical Palace, Qin Ming's body swayed violently. He felt like a small boat adrift on a stormy sea, being battered by colossal waves. If not for the throng of people pressing around him, he might have truly fallen to the ground. Within this golden palace, etched with the marks of time, the surging emotions were so intense that he found them almost unbearable, leaving him dizzy and disoriented.

"No, I want to live, I can't die here!"
"Ah Lan, wait for me to return and marry you. I can withstand the Heavenly Light's corrosion!"
"This old man is 120 years old, life is at its end. I craved the anointing of Heavenly Light to step into a higher realm and extend my life, but in the end, it's futile."
In an instant, Qin Ming resonated with dozens of emotions, all incredibly powerful, surging towards him with the unwillingness and resentment of those on the brink of death.

Moreover, even more emotions surged behind them, crashing towards him like successive waves. If it were just one emotion, he could delve into the person's life and savor it slowly. But with so many, it was an overwhelming torrent, truly more than he could bear. Qin Ming immediately withdrew from the resonance state. If he continued like this, he feared his mind would collapse under the onslaught. He naturally understood the situation. Over the past millennium, countless people had died in the Thunderfire Alchemical Palace. Each of them, before their death, was filled with despair, pain, and intense unwillingness. These emotions, gathered together, were truly terrifying.

Qin Ming rubbed his temples, recovering from the discomfort. His heart, however, remained turbulent, surging with restless thoughts. Aside from the secret texts recording the efforts of predecessors, a place like the Thunderfire Alchemical Palace could actually facilitate spiritual resonance. For a moment, Qin Ming's thoughts churned, and many ideas came to mind. He then stared at the thousand-year-old palace, wondering if, throughout the generations, any Newbies close to death had spiritual fluctuations that touched upon certain secret techniques. He shook his head. It was probably very difficult for someone with such an unyielding will to fight back with special methods even at death's door. He estimated that over ninety percent of people spent their final moments in fear, pain, and despair.

Qin Ming cautiously tried again, quickly touching upon over twenty intense emotions. As he expected, they were predominantly negative. In his perception, those jumbled emotions resembled a black sea, and he was somewhat unwilling to give up, wanting to fish out a few "treasures" from it. "I'll try again next time." It definitely wouldn't work now, as the Thunderfire Alchemical Palace was packed with people. Qin Ming was swept along, about to leave the ancient palace.

"I'm never joining a crowd again," Wu Zheng said with a long face when they returned to the inn. He hadn't managed to keep his other shoe either and had walked back barefoot in the snow. Even though he had just undergone his first Newbification and his physique was strong, he still couldn't quite bear it. Later, he took off his outer coat and wrapped his feet in it. "I didn't even get a clear look at what Mount Chixia and the Thunderfire Alchemical Palace actually look like!" Wu Zheng felt greatly wronged.

Xu Sheng chuckled, "Later, during the early spring outing, are you really not going? All the young ladies from various families will be out then. Don't you want to take a look?"
Wu Zheng stammered, "Well... we'll see about that."

Qin Ming asked, "Brother Xu, judging by the current situation, spring thunder might appear in a few days. If one wants to receive the Heavenly Light, should they go up the mountain in advance to wait, or they'll definitely miss it?"

Xu Sheng became serious. "You're actually thinking of going? Saying survival is next to impossible isn't enough to describe how dangerous it is there. You're still young, don't gamble your life away on a momentary impulse." Wu Zheng also chimed in, advising, "Brother Qin, don't be impulsive! We're not even twenty yet, and you underwent Newbification at the golden age. What's the rush?" Xu Sheng, naturally, strongly opposed him going on such an adventure.

Qin Ming, feeling helpless, revealed some information. "When I was on Mount Heibai, I once accidentally fell into a special node infused with Heavenly Light and successfully endured it." He figured that if anyone wanted to investigate him, this wasn't a secret at all, as the locals all knew.

Wu Zheng suddenly realized, "Ah, right! When you came to my house to read, my grandpa seemed to have mentioned this, saying you have a very tough life." He added, "You were still an ordinary person back then, so it was indeed lucky you survived. But the intensity of the Heavenly Light in the Thunderfire Alchemical Palace has increased many, many times over. You simply won't be able to withstand it."

Qin Ming could see that Xu Sheng was genuinely a good person, truly worried about him, which was why he repeatedly tried to stop him. But Qin Ming truly couldn't explain the details to him—that he could indeed withstand the Heavenly Light's erosion. "Brother Xu, you're a good person. Even though you're trying to stop me like this, I'm still going."

Xu Sheng sighed and finally told him about the need to go up the mountain in advance. "When the time comes, I'll personally go there and pull you out with a rope." This was clearly a euphemism for helping him retrieve his corpse.

Qin Ming said, "Brother Xu, find someone else to pull me out, and take me away as if I were a corpse. Hmm, I'll try to make myself look a bit disheveled then, so my appearance won't be easy to recognize." Xu Sheng was stunned and asked, "What are you planning to do?" Qin Ming explained, "It's to avoid being recognized if I go a second time. For the first time, you shouldn't show up either. Find someone else to take me away. After all, you used to be an itinerant merchant and know many people. What if your appearance makes them notice me?"

Xu Sheng simply couldn't believe his ears. What was this kid talking about? He had even planned for a second time! Was he incredibly bold, or just ignorant and fearless? "Brother Xu, I'm not joking." Qin Ming saw that Xu Sheng was indeed a good person, so he was prepared to trouble him for help. Seeing Qin Ming's confidence, Xu Sheng actually started to think he might survive. Only afterwards did he come back to his senses, feeling like he had gone mad himself, actually agreeing to help Qin Ming find someone to "collect his corpse" when the time came.

The next day, Qin Ming invited Xu Sheng to dinner at the best restaurant to express his gratitude. Xu Sheng was at a loss for words, and Wu Zheng was equally speechless. This was because both of them felt that Qin Ming was ninety percent certain to die on Mount Chixia this time, and they couldn't dissuade him. Yet, here he was, inviting them to dinner so cheerfully. Qin Ming began, "Actually, I still want to ask for Brother Xu's help. I'm wondering if there are any local families whose ancestors were once prominent but are now in decline. I'd like to pay to read their books, to borrow their secret texts. The price is negotiable."

Wu Zheng's eyes looked strange, feeling "hurt" invisibly, unintentionally offended by Brother Qin. Xu Sheng said, "You're very confident, thinking you can survive in the Thunderfire Alchemical Palace. You want to practice a *jinfa* in advance, so you can integrate it into your Heavenly Light *jin* on that day." Qin Ming indeed meant that. He already knew that the combination of spring thunder and external Heavenly Light would not only foster special spiritual substances that allowed people to undergo Newbification, but also, because of the accompanying dense Heavenly Light, its effect would be even stronger than that of the Three-Colored Flower. Those who could survive would be able to enhance the total quantity and quality of their Heavenly Light. That would be the most suitable time to integrate different *jinfa*.

Xu Sheng agreed, saying, "I'll help you inquire. Hmm, what kind of *jinfa* do you need? This is quite particular; you can't just combine them haphazardly." Qin Ming really wanted to say that any *jinfa* would do, but after a moment's thought, he decided to be more modest. "A more vigorous *jinfa*. If there isn't one, others can also be considered." Recently, he had been practicing the Yellow Mud Palm, having already mastered its soft *jin*. It was clear that this *jinfa* was extraordinary, likely having integrated various types of Heavenly Light *jin*. Now, learning one or two more would suffice, not wasting this opportunity to enter the Thunderfire Alchemical Palace.

The next day, Xu Sheng brought news: he had found a fallen family whose ancestors' incomplete techniques still remained, and their current situation was truly beyond words. Qin Ming immediately went with him. When he saw the dilapidated courtyard wall and the ancient house that seemed on the verge of collapsing, he realized that this family had truly fallen into ruin.

Xu Sheng sighed, "The Sun family used to have a large mansion. Alas, fortune is unpredictable. Over a decade ago, the old man of the Sun family was severely injured and died shortly after. His son also died accidentally two years ago, and his daughter-in-law ran off with someone. Now, only an old woman and her three-year-old grandson remain of the Sun family. It's truly difficult."

When Qin Ming saw the Sun family's old woman and the young child, he was instantly moved. The old woman's face was covered in wrinkles, her edges long smoothed by life, and her eyes were unfocused, devoid of any light, only brightening slightly when she looked at her small grandson. It was said that she used to be a young lady from a wealthy family, living a grand life when she married into the prominent Sun family. But now, her husband and son had successively died inexplicably, their family business was lost, and only a grandson remained for her to rely on. Qin Ming felt that if someone was truly targeting them intentionally, then this child would eventually meet with misfortune too. Upon seeing this child, his heart stirred, as if he was looking at his younger self. The three-year-old child's small clothes had many patches. He practiced a certain technique silently, showing great stubbornness. Qin Ming had once seen in his faded memories that his childhood had been very difficult and impoverished, raised solely by an old man who was likely his grandfather, who taught him the methods from a silk scroll.

"Take it and read. It's not worth much anymore. It's always being stolen, and it's completely incomplete. Usually, I just let any children who want to learn look at it for free," the old woman said, taking out a secret manual. She and her grandson lived very hard lives, and neighbors often helped them. She would let others read this book as a way of repayment.

Qin Ming took it, discovering that only the cover was ancient. The dozen or so pages inside didn't seem to be antiques; the Newbification technique was fragmented and incomplete, the *jinfa* descriptions weren't detailed enough, and the handwriting was rather scrawled. Both the beast-hide cover and the paper remarkably carried strong emotional fluctuations. After receiving it, Qin Ming thanked the old woman, sat on a dilapidated chair, and began to study it intently, concentrating his mind. Instantly, he saw certain truths.

"You of Xinyi Hall are too ruthless! My Sun family has declined, and indeed, it's not doing well in my generation, but you still want to seize my family's secret text. Ge Qianxun, I wrongly considered you a brother, yet you struck to kill me." An old man coughed up blood continuously, gravely wounded by people from Xinyi Hall who took the secret text. He only managed to clutch one page, the cover, in his hand. At this moment, he lay prone on the desk, wanting to write down the contents of the lost secret text. But he was already too weak; after writing twenty-some pages, he gave out, finally dying from vomiting blood. Clearly, other things happened later, and this fragmented book ultimately only had a dozen or so pages left. "This must be the truth behind the bloody incident from over a decade ago," Qin Ming sighed. He believed that the death of the old woman's son was also likely related to Xinyi Hall.

Afterward, he concentrated his mind again, resonating with the emotions within the leather cover, and obtained the complete contents of the secret text. This was a hammer technique, quite extraordinary. It contained two Heavenly Light *jinfa*: the Pounding *Jin* and the Whip *Jin*. Only by mastering both could the true power of this hammer technique be unleashed. This book couldn't compare to ultimate techniques like the Yellow Mud Palm or the Heaven-Severing Saber Intent, but Qin Ming was still very satisfied. Having two additional *jinfa* at this critical juncture would greatly help him.

He looked at the pitiable grandmother and grandson, as if seeing his own past life with his grandfather. He took out thirty daytime gold coins and, in front of the old woman, flicked them one by one into the ground. "Elder, I mean no disrespect. I'm just afraid that bad people might trouble you. Whenever you need it, quietly take out one coin. Later, if I master the hammer technique, I will write a new book for you, perfecting this method." Afterward, he took out a few silver coins and placed them in her hand. Without waiting for her to speak, he turned and left.

Xu Sheng, waiting in the courtyard, spoke, "You finished reading so quickly?"
"Mm, I've read it. Let's go," Qin Ming nodded. The old woman chased after them but found that they were walking too fast and she definitely couldn't catch up. Finally, her aged eyes welled up, and cloudy tears fell silently.

***

Earthly mists rose, and the weather grew warmer day by day. Light rain danced through the forests, and the accumulated snow melted quickly. Qin Ming had already ascended Mount Chixia. After these few days, the place had finally become much quieter, no longer a sea of people. On Mount Chixia, there was a popular mountain god temple. Some pilgrims, seeing the considerable number of people who had already moved onto the mountain, preparing to receive the Heavenly Light baptism, couldn't help but say, "In this day and age, do you even have to queue up to die?" Qin Ming heard these words and, instead of getting angry, couldn't help but chuckle.

This time, he had the chance to admire the scenery of Mount Chixia. When spring fully bloomed, the entire mountain would be ablaze with fiery red, all vegetation predominantly crimson. For now, he could only appreciate the peculiar sights like sheer cliffs and strange rock formations. For the next few days, he entered the brightly tiled, gleaming Thunderfire Alchemical Palace daily, enduring the impact of various resentments, meticulously searching for something. He wanted to fish for treasures in the black ocean of chaotic emotions and had never given up hope.

Boom!
On this day, the first spring thunder rumbled in the distance.
Qin Ming suddenly looked up. Was it finally coming?
