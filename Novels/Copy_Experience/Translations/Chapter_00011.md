## Chapter 11: Qi Condensation Third Level

When he saw the number 287, Lu Xu knew that Daoist Friend Liu was not far from the perfection of Qi Condensation Sixth Level.

The four levels on the stone stele – Entry, Minor Accomplishment, Major Accomplishment, and Grand Completion – correspond respectively to the Early, Mid, Late, and Grand Completion stages of Qi Condensation.

For ordinary cultivators, only by cultivating to the corresponding realm can they generate the corresponding experience.

A Qi Condensation First Level cultivator, no matter what, could not train the Azurewood Art's experience to Major Accomplishment, unless they were someone who had crippled their cultivation and re-cultivated.

But Lu Xu could!

He could directly copy the experience, allowing him to possess high-level experience at a low realm.

"287, that truly is a large number!"

Lu Xu turned and left.

Upon returning home, he placed the beast meat and spirit rice together.

Counting it up, he hadn't eaten meat in several years. Ever since he started cultivating, his diet had been extremely plain, and he genuinely missed the taste of meat now.

However, longing was longing; Lu Xu was not in a hurry to enjoy the beast meat immediately.

He planned to give some to each of his neighbors, to ensure they ate it without any issues before he consumed it himself.

Taking out 223 spirit stones, Lu Xu converted all of them into replication points. Added to the 64 replication points he already had, the number on the Bluestone Tablet's replication point line became 287.

The next day, he went to the market again, came to the old man's stall, and pretended to look at spirit wine, but mentally chanted.

"Replicate!"

After a flash of green light, a vast amount of experience flew out from the old man's body and poured into Lu Xu's mind.

This experience was about how the old man meticulously, little by little, raised his cultivation through countless trials.

It included how he broke through the bottleneck of the early Qi Condensation stage, and how he slowly raised his magic power to the sixth level of Qi Condensation.

With this experience, Lu Xu felt as if he had been a Qi Condensation Sixth Level cultivator in a previous life who cultivated the Azurewood Art, and was now reincarnated to re-cultivate.

"Daoist friend, you've been looking for so long, are you planning to buy a jar? This old man's spirit wine is brewed from the finest Purple Gourd Spirit Rice, and a jar only costs three spirit stones!" The old man approached with a warm smile.

Purple Gourd Spirit Rice is a first-rank mid-grade spirit rice. Its appearance is a purple gourd grown on a gourd vine, and after opening the gourd, it's entirely filled with spirit rice.

This kind of spirit rice was far superior to Lu Xu's Azure Lake Spirit Rice.

Lu Xu regained his senses.

He casually picked up a jar of wine, opened it, and sniffed. Immediately, a rich wine aroma assaulted his nose, and the purity of the spiritual energy contained within invigorated him.

"Then I'll take a jar!" Lu Xu nodded, handed the old man three spirit stones, and left with the jar of wine.

Back home, in the quiet room on the second floor, Lu Xu sat down cross-legged, calming his mind to sort through that vast cultivation experience.

The old man's experience from embarking on the path of cultivation to reaching the second level of Qi Condensation was identical to what Lu Xu had gone through.

Both of them cultivated the "Azurewood Art," and there was no situation where the cultivation method produced different effects on different people.

This was the advantage of common, widespread techniques.

Although the "Azurewood Art" was a widespread wood-element cultivation method, as ordinary as could be, it had no advantages compared to top-tier methods.

But its great advantage was precisely its commonness!

Its commonness meant that there was almost no possibility of going astray while cultivating this method, and at the same time, it was impossible for someone to intentionally leave traps within it.

"This way, the bottleneck from the third to fourth level of Qi Condensation will be much easier for me!"

Lu Xu possessed a mid-grade spiritual root; this bottleneck itself presented limited obstruction to him.

Now, with someone else's experience of breaking through this bottleneck, it practically ceased to exist for him!

"This is the benefit of replicating experience!"

A smile appeared on Lu Xu's face.

"After I take care of some miscellaneous matters, I'll enter seclusion for cultivation."

A few days later, Lu Xu went to harvest the spirit rice and completed the transaction with Fatty Mo, selling a portion of the spirit rice for five spirit stones.

Upon returning to his courtyard, Lu Xu saw a dark-skinned, ordinary-looking, slightly rustic youth diligently practicing a spell.

When he saw Lu Xu come out, he quickly put away his spell and grinned:

"Big Brother Lu, was business good today?"

"It was alright, sold a few talismans. Er-lengzi, your Geng Metal Art seems very proficient now!" Lu Xu smiled slightly, looking at the rustic youth.

This young man named Han Er-lengzi had a name that could be described as quite simple and down-to-earth.

In reality, he didn't have a proper given name, only the nickname Er-lengzi.

He was a cultivator who moved into this courtyard after Leng Quan. Originally a farm boy, he was only accidentally discovered by the Mo family's welcoming immortal envoy.

This rustic youth possessed a superior low-grade metal-attribute spiritual root; his aptitude was quite good. After being brought back by the welcoming immortal envoy, he was also placed under Fatty Mo's command, becoming a spirit farmer.

"I practiced for a long time to get it like this. I wonder when I'll be able to reach your level, Big Brother Lu!" Er-lengzi chuckled honestly, scratching the back of his head.

Then, a strong envy appeared in his eyes:

"Big Brother Lu, I truly envy you talisman masters. You must earn a lot of spirit stones, right?"

"Not at all, it's all hard-earned money. And you know, I'm still carrying a spirit stone loan!"

"Sigh, if only those moneylenders weren't so terrifying, I'd also want to learn talisman crafting like you, Big Brother Lu!"

"Definitely not, you're different from me!" Lu Xu quickly dispelled Er-lengzi's notion.

After encouraging him a few words, Lu Xu returned to his home.

Days passed one after another.

Lu Xu stopped crafting talismans. Aside from checking his spirit fields periodically, he dedicated all his time to cultivation.

Every three months, he would change his appearance and go to the Hundred Herbs Pavilion to buy a bottle of Qi Replenishing Pills.

Thus, a full year passed.

"Finally, I've broken through to the third level of Qi Condensation!"

Opening his eyes in surprise, Lu Xu stood up, feeling the surging and powerful magic power within his body, his entire being exuding an imposing aura.

Within his Dantian, a thumb-sized azure qi cluster slowly rotated and floated.

From time to time, wisps of azure qi flowed out from it, entering his meridians, circulating repeatedly, completing one grand cycle before returning to the Dantian.

"Hahaha, my strength has advanced another step!" Lu Xu was somewhat excited.

He slowly paced around the room. After his mood calmed down, he sat down cross-legged and introspected.

On the Bluestone Tablet:

[Name: Lu Xu]
[Lifespan: 19/111 years]
[Cultivation: Qi Condensation Third Level]
[Spiritual Root: Wood (Mid-low)]
[Cultivation Method: Azurewood Art (Minor Accomplishment): 287/300]
[Replication Points: 0]

[Skills - Spells]:
Minor Rain-Cloud Art (Minor Accomplishment): 131/300
Geng Metal Sword (Minor Accomplishment): 122/300
Sharpness Art (Minor Accomplishment): 117/300
Fireball Art (Entry-level): 29/100

[Skills - Talisman Crafting]:
First-rank Low-grade Talisman Master: 44/100
First-rank Mid-grade Talisman Master: 12/100 (3x)

His lifespan increased by another four years!

"As expected of a wood-element cultivation method!"

Lu Xu secretly praised. Although wood-element cultivation methods were not good for combat, when it came to nourishing life, no one could compare.

Besides the change in lifespan, a new spell appeared on the stone tablet.

This was something Lu Xu had incidentally practiced over the past year.

In fact, besides Fireball Art, the spells he learned also included Concealment Art, Spirit Eye Art, Object Manipulation Art, Cleansing Art, and so on.

These were basically standard cultivator spells; those who hadn't learned them almost didn't deserve to be called cultivators.

In fact, because the latter few spells were too simple, the Bluestone Tablet didn't even display them; only the experience data for Fireball Art appeared.

The Concealment Art's sole purpose was to hide one's cultivation, preventing others from seeing through it at a glance.

And the Spirit Eye Art happened to be the counter to this spell; casting Spirit Eye Art allowed one to see through hidden cultivations.

Furthermore, Spirit Eye Art could enhance vision, increase night vision, see through mist, and so on. It could be said to be a quite practical spell.

Normally, cultivators should have learned all these spells by their second year in the cultivation world.

However, Lu Xu had been too busy before and hadn't focused on these spells.

Now that he had ample time, he took some time to practice these spells.
