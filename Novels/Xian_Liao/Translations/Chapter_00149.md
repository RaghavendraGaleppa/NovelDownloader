# Chapter 149: Divine Thunder's Might, the Sword Slays the Great Demon

Meng Xuan's mind was in turmoil, but as a mid-stage Golden Core demonic cultivator, his instincts told him that not only was the Divine Thunder Light on Qing Hui Sword poised to strike him at any moment, but that damned Qin Fang's divine sense was also subtly lingering around him.

The body cultivator beside Zhou Qing had an unbroken surge of vital energy above his head, like an accumulating flood. Jin Guang was also watching him like a tiger eyeing its prey, while the great demon in the form of a firebird glared at him fiercely.

After Zhou Qing finished speaking, he appeared calm and composed. Yet among those present, Zhou Qing was the most enigmatic. Despite having only formed his Golden Core a dozen years ago—making it impossible for him to have reached the mid-stage Golden Core level—and his cultivation undoubtedly inferior to Meng Xuan's, this inexplicable sense of mystery lingered in Meng Xuan's mind. He simply couldn't gauge Zhou Qing's true depth.

"Either agree or disagree, just give us a straight answer," Zhang Jingxiu's voice boomed like rolling thunder, his blood qi surging. Though only at the early-stage True Body realm, far below the four demonic sect leaders, the distance between them in the hall was negligible for cultivators of their level. Who wouldn't feel a hint of fear facing a body cultivator?

"And that sixth Golden Core aura—I still can't detect it," Meng Xuan thought, making a difficult decision.

"Since Fellow Daoist Qinglingzi is the successor designated by Patriarch Tianxuan, why use the word 'borrow' for the Black Water Divine Stele fragment? Consider it a gift," Meng Xuan laughed heartily, showing no trace of anger.

The tense atmosphere in Tianxuan Hall eased slightly. Meng Xuan exhaled softly, feeling both relieved and somewhat disappointed. The others also relaxed somewhat.

For Daoist Shasheng and Chiyang, since they weren't the ones paying the price, avoiding conflict was best. Given the current situation, even if they allied with Meng Xuan, they wouldn't gain any advantage. Moreover, even if they won by some miracle, it would be a pyrrhic victory, allowing the demonic race to reap enormous benefits. Not to mention, Patriarch Tianxuan's fate remained uncertain.

If a late-stage Golden Core cultivator were to pass away and return their power to heaven, the disturbance would be impossible to hide as long as Patriarch Tianxuan remained in the Jingyang Dao Domain. Thus, they concluded that Patriarch Tianxuan was likely still alive but unable to act—which wasn't necessarily a bad thing.

Seeing Meng Xuan yield to Zhou Qing once again, Jin Guang couldn't help but smile, admiring Zhou Qing greatly. He was grateful he had resolved his grievances with Zhou Qing early on. Zhou Qing now had three Golden Core-level allies, his strength far surpassing Jin Guang's, yet he still allowed Jin Guang to retain his high status and authority in Tianxuan City—truly a man of great magnanimity.

From now on, Jin Guang decided to support Luopoling even more vigorously and instruct his clan members not to offend Fusong and the others.

Meng Xuan handed over the Black Water Divine Stele fragment to Zhou Qing without any tricks. Zhou Qing accepted it calmly and said, "Fellow Daoist Meng, thank you."

Meng Xuan's expression grew even more amiable. "Fellow Daoist Qinglingzi, there's no need for formalities. Our human race faces dire straits, with storms looming at any moment. We must unite as one."

Having yielded, he might as well go all the way. His Black Water Sect cultivated water-based techniques—water, the softest of elements. If brute force wouldn't work, then softness would overcome hardness. Water flows to the lowest places, yet it is closest to the Dao. Thus, temporary humility meant nothing.

Though a mid-stage Golden Core demonic overlord, facing the pressure of six Golden Core-level existences, with two potential allies ready to abandon him at any moment, what else could he do? Meng Xuan consoled himself well—there was no loyalty among the demonic path.

Daoist Shasheng and the others inwardly scorned him but couldn't help feeling some admiration. Meng Xuan's ability to bend without breaking, his utter disregard for reputation, was both despicable and intimidating.

Zhou Qing said, "Fellow Daoist Meng speaks wisely. We must unite to resist the demonic race."

Meng Xuan asked, "Then what is the second matter Fellow Daoist Qinglingzi wishes to discuss?"

He thought Zhou Qing, having just subdued him, must be riding high. By buttering him up, Zhou Qing might become overconfident and offend Daoist Shasheng, Chiyang, or even Qin Fang and Jin Guang, creating rifts. Then, Meng Xuan might have a chance to settle the score later. The heavens would repay his grievances in time.

Zhou Qing smiled faintly. "To be frank, my current cultivation is largely due to my skill in alchemy. I need the Black Water Divine Stele fragment for the spiritual herbs in the Divine Water Palace, to refine a pill that will aid my cultivation. After forming the Golden Core, our progress becomes increasingly difficult without elixirs to assist us."

His words struck a chord with Meng Xuan and the others. Their cultivation had stagnated at mid-stage Golden Core for years, with the late stage seeming just out of reach. As for Nascent Soul formation, it was a distant dream, like flowers in a mirror or the moon reflected in water—visible but untouchable.

They believed Zhou Qing's claim of being an alchemy master. Luopoling had been consistently selling spiritual pills, albeit low-grade ones, indicating the backing of an alchemy master. Moreover, Zhou Qing had not only formed his Golden Core but also had an early-stage True Body ally, a Golden Core-level great demon, and another mysterious Golden Core existence. Cultivating so many allies would be impossible without elixirs.

The third matter was forming a Golden Core alliance and electing a leader. They established rules: if any faction was besieged by the demonic race, the others must provide support. Currently, the human race was far weaker than the demonic race, and only unity could buy them time.

If Zhou Qing had once been the human race's hope as entrusted by Patriarch Tianxuan, now he was the hope for Meng Xuan, Daoist Shasheng, and others to break through their cultivation bottlenecks. A Golden Core-level alchemist was of immense significance.

Zhou Qing was unanimously elected as the alliance leader. The vote was conducted openly, with Qin Fang even growling, "Who agrees? Who opposes?" while glaring at Meng Xuan, hoping he'd abstain or oppose.

Meng Xuan wasn't fooled—he would have raised both hands in agreement if he could.

After Meng Xuan and the others left, Chiyang remarked, "The heavens of the Jingyang Dao Domain are about to change dramatically."

"Fellow Daoist Qinglingzi, though they've elected you as leader, demonic cultivators are untrustworthy. You must remain cautious," Qin Fang, the Blood Demon Sect leader, advised righteously. He was determined to seize this chance for his sect to reform.

Zhou Qing smiled confidently. "Thank you for the reminder. Such matters depend on mutual benefit, not force."

The news of the human alliance, uniting righteous and demonic factions under Zhou Qing's leadership, spread like wildfire. Bai Yue and the other demon kings soon learned of it.

Bai Yue sneered, "It seems the Black Water Sect has no sincerity. In that case, let us crush them." He planned to dismantle the human alliance piece by piece. If they could destroy one of the four great demonic sects without retaliation, they'd proceed to eliminate the rest. If Patriarch Tianxuan still didn't appear, Bai Yue would directly assault Luopoling.

As the beast tide approached, guided by the demon kings, a massive wave of beasts surged toward the Black Water Sect. The situation was overwhelmingly one-sided.

Bai Yue and the other two demon kings took positions at the rear, their auras firmly locking onto Meng Xuan in Black Water Palace, ensuring he couldn't escape. A Golden Core-level great demon, the Savage Bull, led the charge, assaulting the Black Water Palace's protective formation.

Soon, the formation's barrier rippled like water. Moments later, the three demon kings jointly unleashed a beam of primordial energy from afar, bringing the formation to the brink of collapse. The Savage Bull swung its massive spiked club, delivering the final blow.

With a deafening explosion that shook the heavens, the formation shattered. The colossal club swept through Black Water Palace, sending over a dozen demonic cultivators flying, blood spraying from their mouths.

As the formation broke, Meng Xuan attempted to flee but was immediately blocked by the three demon kings, each stronger than him. "Meng Xuan, you will die today," Bai Yue declared imperiously.

"Don't force me to self-destruct," Meng Xuan threatened, though he still held a Death Substitute Talisman. He hoped to buy time, waiting to see if Zhou Qing and the others would truly come to his aid.

Bai Yue's expression shifted slightly at the threat. A mid-stage Golden Core human cultivator's self-destruction was no small matter. "You humans scheme against each other. Meng Xuan, I'll give you one last chance—submit or die."

"Unless you swear not to harm me," Meng Xuan countered.

Bai Yue's voice turned icy. "Meng Xuan, don't refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit. You have ten breaths to decide." As he secretly gathered his demonic power for a decisive strike, the sky darkened abruptly.

Above Black Water Palace, black clouds gathered. The demonic cultivators inside were in disarray, wailing in agony. The Savage Bull rampaged, its club leaving none unscathed—even some beasts were reduced to pulp. To great demons, lesser beasts weren't truly part of their kind.

Suddenly, a green flying sword appeared in the sky. As it emerged, dark clouds converged, and terrifying thunder gathered under its guidance. A radiant light burst from the sword.

"By the might of heaven, let the thunder be summoned!"

In an instant, silence fell over Black Water Palace. A terrifying, oppressive, destructive aura spread through the beast tide. The sword's tip pointed directly at the Savage Bull, which shuddered uncontrollably.

Memories flooded its mind—of when it was just a newly awakened beast, cowering in a cave during a thunderstorm. Fear consumed its entire being.

The green sword summoned the heavens' wrath, unleashing a blinding pillar of divine thunder that struck the Savage Bull's head with unimaginable speed. Against such celestial might, the bull could only swing its club instinctively—a futile effort.

The Divine Thunder Light erupted with annihilating force. Qing Hui Sword pierced through the club and slashed down. A brilliant explosion, like a full moon, erupted from the Savage Bull's body. The sword's radiance was beyond description.

The great demon was slain.

The thunder's majestic power rippled outward, momentarily quelling the beast tide. The Savage Bull's mountainous corpse collapsed onto Black Water Palace's ground, creating a massive crater.

Then—one, two, three... eight Golden Core auras surged across the sky.

"Bai Yue, if you seek battle, then battle!" A hoarse voice echoed like rolling thunder as an aged figure flickered within the heavenly thunderlight, surrounded by swirling yin-yang energies.

"Tianxuan?!" Bai Yue and the other demon kings exclaimed, a primal fear gripping them.

Zhou Qing's offer was too tempting—the Purple Longevity Pill, capable of extending a Golden Core cultivator's lifespan. Even Meng Xuan now hoped Zhou Qing would succeed. Compared to the elusive secrets of the Divine Water Palace, the pill was far more tangible.

The alliance was formed, with Zhou Qing as its leader. The rules were clear: any faction under attack would receive support. Humanity's strength paled before the demonic race's; only unity could buy them time.

Once, Zhou Qing had been Patriarch Tianxuan's chosen hope for humanity. Now, he was the hope for Meng Xuan, Daoist Shasheng, and others to break through their bottlenecks. A Golden Core-level alchemist was invaluable.

Zhou Qing was elected leader by unanimous vote—openly, with Qin Fang glaring at Meng Xuan, daring him to oppose. Meng Xuan, of course, raised both hands in agreement.

As they departed, Chiyang mused, "The heavens of the Jingyang Dao Domain are about to change."

"Fellow Daoist Qinglingzi, though they've made you leader, demonic cultivators are faithless. Stay vigilant," Qin Fang advised earnestly, seizing the chance to reform his Blood Demon Sect.

Zhou Qing smiled confidently. "Thank you. Such alliances depend on mutual benefit, not coercion."

The news spread rapidly. Bai Yue, upon hearing it, scoffed, "The Black Water Sect is insincere. Let us destroy them." He aimed to dismantle the human alliance piece by piece. Crushing one of the four great demonic sects without retaliation would embolden them to eliminate the rest. If Patriarch Tianxuan still didn't appear, they'd assault Luopoling directly.

The beast tide surged toward the Black Water Sect, overwhelming its defenses. Bai Yue and the other demon kings pinned Meng Xuan down, preventing his escape. The Savage Bull led the assault, shattering the palace's formation with a final blow from its massive club.

As the formation collapsed, Meng Xuan threatened self-destruction, stalling for time. Bai Yue, wary of the consequences, offered him a choice: submit or die.

Then, the sky darkened. A green sword appeared, summoning divine thunder that annihilated the Savage Bull in a single strike. Eight Golden Core auras erupted across the sky, and Patriarch Tianxuan's voice thundered, "Bai Yue, if you seek battle, then battle!"

The demon kings trembled. The tide had turned.
