# Chapter 46: The Protagonist

The investigation indeed yielded some findings, though they weren't extensively related to Zixu.

"People from Daluo Academy contacted him?" Zhou Tian looked at the note on the table, where the ink was still wet, and said slowly.

The Prince of Qin's Estate was, after all, a colossal power within the Tianqin Dynasty, closely intertwined with the Qin Emperor. Within moments of Zhou Tian giving the order, information began to trickle back.

"Yes, Young Master. People from Daluo Academy did contact him. We couldn't ascertain the specifics of their conversation, but it happened the day after you humiliated them!" the black-clad servant, kneeling on one knee below, said in a deep voice. They could gather intelligence, but they weren't omnipresent overseers; discovering what someone said at a specific moment was still quite challenging.

"However, after contacting them, the people from Daluo Academy subsequently contacted several rogue cultivators. We investigated further and found that these rogue cultivators all experienced varying degrees of improvement in their strength after their contact, with three of them even making it into the top sixteen," the black-clad servant added.

Thump! Thump!

Zhou Tian's fingers tapped on the table, his brows furrowed. Why would people from Daluo Academy help those rogue cultivators? Zhou Tian couldn't figure it out on his own, but he had people under him. He spoke up: "What are your conjectures regarding their motives?"

"Reporting, Young Master, your subordinate speculates that they hold a grudge over the humiliation they suffered that day and are looking for an opportunity to retaliate. However, since you are not participating in the competition, they can only target the Crown Princess!" This black-clad servant was specially trained by the Prince of Qin's Estate, professional and thorough, even taking the initiative to explain the entire situation to Zhou Tian for fear he wouldn't grasp the full context.

"Targeting Tian Ling... How audacious..." Zhou Tian leaned back in his chair, his eyes deep, his chest rising and falling. Fury simmered within him as he said chillingly, "Can we eliminate them directly?"

"This..." The black-clad man hesitated for a moment before replying, "Young Master, I'm afraid not. They are, after all, Daluo Academy. Without a proper reason, the Empire would be in a very passive position!"

Zhou Tian half-closed his eyes, saying nothing. He had been too presumptuous just now. They were a power on par with the Zhou family, and the repercussions had to be considered. Otherwise, the subsequent cost could be immense; while it wouldn't lead to war, many other things would certainly have to be sacrificed.

After closing his eyes and pondering for a moment, Zhou Tian roughly formulated a plan and spoke, "When will Tian Ling be able to face one of these three individuals?"

"If she advances smoothly, she should encounter one of them in the quarterfinals five days from now!" The black-clad man didn't hesitate in the slightest; he had all this information at his fingertips.

"Good. Send invitations to the Prince of Xiaoyao's Estate, the Imperial Advisor's Residence, the Prime Minister's Mansion, the Duke's Estate, and the Third Prince. Five days from now, I, Zhou Tian, will invite them to watch the competition!"

"Furthermore, find Zixu and tell him I invite him to the Prince of Qin's Estate."

"Investigate all social connections of the rogue cultivators contacted by Daluo Academy and bring everyone related to them to the Imperial Capital!"

"I want to see just how capable the people from Daluo Academy can be in my Tianqin Imperial Capital!" Zhou Tian said coldly, issuing a series of commands. Since Daluo Academy wanted to play dirty, he would crush them with the force of thunder!

"Understood!" The black-clad man bowed and retreated, relaying the orders.

With Zhou Tian's successive commands, the entire Prince of Qin's Estate sprang into action. Countless figures rushed to various parts of Futian Province overnight, and invitations were delivered to numerous residences. Many well-informed individuals in the Imperial Capital were surprised by the Prince of Qin's Estate's significant movements, extending their feelers to inquire about what had truly transpired.

Zhou Tian did not tell Tian Ling about this matter. Although he could persuade her to withdraw from the competition, Tian Ling would likely heed his advice if he insisted. But that would be too cowardly. Zhou Tian was the Crown Prince of Qin; how could he tolerate being bullied to this extent?

As the great sun set and dusk just began to fall, Zixu arrived at the Estate. No one knew the specifics of their discussion, but he departed in less than an hour.

Inside Zhou Tian's room, after Zixu had left, looking at the spot where Zixu had just been sitting, Zhou Tian spoke to himself, "Uncle Zhou, was there anything unusual about that lad?"

A figure emerged from the shadows, bowing slightly, and respectfully reported to Zhou Tian, "Reporting, Young Master, he possesses another divine soul!"

"Another divine soul?" Zhou Tian was slightly surprised. No way, why did that sound so familiar...

"That's right, he has another divine soul within him, likely inside the necklace he wears around his neck. Although it was trying extremely hard to conceal its presence, I still sensed it..." Uncle Zhou said calmly.

"How interesting..." Zhou Tian's interest was piqued. He took Zixu's profile from Uncle Zhou again and began flipping through it.

"...Orphan... discovered in the wilderness by Elder Ziling of Haotian Sect when he was still an infant... only possessing a necklace engraved with the character 'Xu'... remained unremarkable for many years... recently suddenly displayed extraordinary talent... heavily cultivated by Haotian Sect... deeply infatuated with his senior sister Tian Ling..."

Although he had read it once before Zixu arrived, reading it again, now knowing about the other divine soul within him, made everything seem eerily familiar...

"Isn't this the template for a protagonist's rise? How interesting!" Zhou Tian's expression became strange.

"Young Master, should I bring him back?" Uncle Zhou saw Zhou Tian's expression change and assumed he was displeased with the last sentence in the profile.

"Can you sense what cultivation realm the divine soul within that necklace possessed in its lifetime?" Zhou Tian didn't answer directly, but changed the subject and asked.

"Just a Saint King, nothing more..." Uncle Zhou said indifferently.

"Just a Saint King... I wonder what expression my father would have if he knew?" Zhou Tian chuckled.

"It's different. Master's Saint King realm is not the same as that divine soul's Saint King realm. Master can slay such Saint Kings as easily as butchering dogs!" Uncle Zhou said earnestly.

Zhou Tian was no longer the naive newcomer he was when he first transmigrated. Recently, he had been cramming knowledge. After the Saint realm came the Saint King, above Saint King was Great Emperor, above Great Emperor was Heavenly King, above Heavenly King was Dao Master, and above Dao Master was Heavenly Venerate. The Zhou family's records only went up to Heavenly Venerate; he didn't know if there were realms beyond that.

His two older brothers were only at the Saint realm. Cultivating a Dharma Idol to the Saint realm wasn't simple; it required nurturing the Dharma Idol to a height of ten thousand zhang, then integrating it with one's body, bringing its immense power back to oneself to achieve sainthood. This was a very time-consuming process!

*Uncle Zhou, I really should tell you something: a bootlicker licks until they have nothing left! And 'slaying Saint Kings like butchering dogs'—why don't you say 'slaying Great Emperors like butchering dogs'?* Of course, this was just Zhou Tian's internal monologue; he certainly wouldn't voice it aloud.

"Forget it. It's just a remnant divine soul of a Saint King. Let's not touch him for now. After all, he's Ling'er's junior brother; if she found out, she'd definitely hate me." Zhou Tian waved his hand. He wasn't cruel enough to kill someone merely because they admired Tian Ling. Moreover, Zixu hadn't shown him any hatred, and he had been very cooperative during their recent conversation, quickly agreeing to his requests.
