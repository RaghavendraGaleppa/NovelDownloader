## Chapter 189: The Sky Has Fallen

In the night sky, the red sun was disintegrating, exploding inch by inch. This scene stunned everyone!

Pu Heng, Cao Qianqiu's eldest disciple, possessed an extremely profound cultivation, yet he was struck by a single punch... and began to continuously explode.

Where did this fierce individual come from? Everyone found it unbelievable, looking towards the youth on the golden exotic bird.

Boom!

Swathes of crimson lightning interwoven, the red sun sank west, then completely collapsed.

"Ah..." A suppressed roar echoed, and the shattered red sun re-condensed. This was the terrifying aspect of Pure Yang consciousness; it was incredibly difficult to truly destroy. This was because Pure Yang consciousness had either undergone "tribulation" or been baptized by "immortal fire," thus initially possessing the characteristics of indestructibility and imperishability.

Why were Immortal Path disciples so confident? Indeed, the further they progressed, the more terrifying they became, and their cultivation speed was also faster, allowing them to advance rapidly for extended periods.

"You don't have your master's fortune, but you've caught his disease," the youth on the golden exotic bird said, dressed in coarse linen, exuding a sense of returning to simplicity.

Who dared to comment like that? At the very least, in the region of Fei Xian Academy, apart from Sun Taichu, probably no one dared to speak so.

Undeniably, Cao Qianqiu's lineage was hated by both gods and ghosts; even stray dogs would want to pounce and bite them a few times. Not to mention ordinary people's perceptions, but they were ridiculously strong, and no one could do anything about them. For so many years, Cao Qianqiu had single-handedly covered the sky, suppressing Heaven-gifted figures like the Hegemon, kicking through an unknown number of "iron plates," and overturning many monument-level elders one by one. It could be said that watching him forge his way through, no one could stop him.

His disciples and followers also developed similar personalities, wanting to emulate Cao Qianqiu in everything, taking their master as their highest goal. Moreover, because they were indeed astonishingly strong, they rarely met with setbacks. There was only one instance: Cao Qianqiu's favorite fourth disciple, who was arrogant and looked down on everything, ended up kicking an "exotic gold plate" and was literally crushed to death by the ill-tempered and equally dominant Hegemon. Other disciples, despite their overbearing personalities, had never encountered any trouble until now.

Objectively speaking, Pu Heng was quite detestable, but among his generation, he was indeed a top-tier talent, which was quite frustrating. Counting people from all paths, he could already sit in the front row. Many were spreading rumors that he already possessed twenty percent of Cao Qianqiu's power!

"Who are you?" Pu Heng reappeared, standing within the red sun. His expression was extremely solemn, no longer as arrogant as before.

"Hmm?!" A small number of people were shocked, having keenly noticed that the red sun in the sky had dimmed considerably. This was truly terrifying! Clearly, Pu Heng was injured. His initially indestructible and imperishable Pure Yang consciousness had actually had a portion of its crimson radiance cut away!

Qin Ming looked at the figure in the night sky. Was that Senior Brother Lu Zizai of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court? Why did he feel something was different?

"Go wait on the side!" the linen-clad youth commanded, showing Pu Heng no respect whatsoever.

Pu Heng's face within the red sun was grim. Aside from his master, who dared to scold him like that? Especially the New Life Path, where even a few Ancestral Masters were old and frail, with no successors. Where did this guy come from?

"A foul mouth leads to death!" the linen-clad youth warned.

Qing Tian's disciple chuckled, "Pu Heng, do you really think you're Cao Qianqiu? You have his temper, but not his cultivation. You'll die a violent death sooner or later."

No one expected such a supreme being to emerge from the New Life Path. Although his name was unknown, judging by his demeanor, he was a super-fierce individual capable of blowing up Pu Heng! People from the Immortal Path, Esoteric Path, and Heterodox Path had complex feelings. This New Life Path, which seemed to be declining, actually had someone capable of raising its banner appear?

Many new disciples were incredibly excited. Numerous people were present that night, and upon seeing this scene, even some old cultivators felt their eyes sting with emotion. These people felt that this path was indeed failing. With several Ancestral Masters about to pass away, there was no longer any hope. Because for many years, no one had been able to further expand the path. Especially, where did the outstanding disciples they themselves had nurtured end up? They all became guards for others, or external protectors.

Rip!

In the night sky, lightning flickered all around. Pu Heng drew a long sword inscribed with phoenix patterns. Pure Yang energy surged overwhelmingly, dispelling the night mist. This was an extremely terrifying exotic treasure.

The most dazzling presence here, naturally, was Sun Taichu within that golden great sun. He waved his hand, stopping Pu Heng and preventing him from acting.

"So it's you." Sun Taichu sat cross-legged on the clouds, smiling faintly. The golden great sun shone upon the ten directions, dispelling Pu Heng's crimson radiance, and also dimming the golden exotic bird and the youth on its back. Although Sun Taichu appeared calm, he was ultimately from the Outer Pure Land, and it was impossible for him to watch Pu Heng suffer a loss.

"To think you could still appear, and are alive to this day," Sun Taichu said with a smile. The golden radiance he emitted was brilliant and vast, illuminating the heavens and the earth. People saw the golden exotic bird trembling, becoming unstable in the air. Moreover, the linen-clad youth on its back underwent a transformation: his black hair turned white, and his body rapidly soared, becoming a giant pulsating with golden light. People saw the twilight aura and decay on him; this was no youth, but someone who had endured long years, likely with little lifespan remaining.

"I want to live another life!" the golden giant declared. Six kinds of light mist diffused around him, forming auspicious clouds that encircled him.

"Six Imperial Heavenly Light!" Some people from the Immortal Path and Esoteric Path were startled, recognizing the substance forming the golden giant.

Qin Ming immediately understood; this was the giant he had seen before. When he was practicing the "River Luo Sutra" in the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, he had once "spirit-traveled" in a semi-conscious state. At that time, Lu Zizai and the Six Imperial Ancestral Master were supposedly conversing, both with dense black mist behind them, and each with a colossal figure standing behind them. Qin Ming guessed that this golden giant was probably the "past" cultivation of the youthful Lu Zizai. If that was the case, then the giant behind the Six Imperial Ancestral Master he had seen back then was stained with much blood, which was clearly problematic.

Sun Taichu shook his head with a smile, saying, "The potential of your path has reached its end. The vast sea of night mist blocks the way ahead; you cannot cross it. Although you are old now, your Heavenly Light fused consciousness is already equivalent to Pure Yang. Why not join my Outer Land and walk the Immortal Path? You could extend your life for another generation."

People from the Immortal Path, Esoteric Path, and higher-grade heterogeneous beings were all greatly shaken. Sun Taichu seemed gentle, but his Pure Yang consciousness illuminated, revealing the true decayed state of the linen-clad youth. His methods were unfathomable. Furthermore, was he advising, or trying to subdue a mysterious strong expert from the New Life Path with irresistible power, to make him defect to his side? No matter how one looked at it, Sun Taichu appeared unfathomable.

The hearts of those from the New Life Path sank. The excitement and surging passion they had just felt quickly extinguished. Reality was just this cold.

"Not my path, not my method. Are you going to act against me?" Lu Zizai asked.

Sun Taichu smiled, saying, "I observe something peculiar about your body; faintly, it seems connected to a sliver of life force in the distance. I wish to take your pulse and confirm this."

Just then, a boiling great sun suddenly appeared in the distant night sky, terrifying and horrifying, composed of incredibly potent Heavenly Light! The light it projected caused even Sun Taichu's Pure Yang consciousness to slightly waver.

Everyone was horrified. A true Ancestral Master from the New Life Path had arrived?!

Sun Taichu chuckled, sitting cross-legged there. The great sun outside his body expanded, emitting thousands of golden rays, dispelling the clouds and mist in the night sky, and briefly interacting with the boiling great sun's Heavenly Light in the distance. Both great suns wavered slightly, then stabilized again. People saw Sun Taichu, like the rising sun first appearing on the sea, with endless golden light, slowly ascending, full of vigorous vitality. In the distance, although the boiling Heavenly Light was still very intense, its true state was illuminated: it was already wreathed in an aura of decay, accompanied by black mist. That Ancestral Master didn't have much time left; they were likely not long for this world!

The area fell silent, and people from different paths had completely different moods. It was clear that the Immortal Path disciples could barely hide their joy. They saw an incredibly brilliant future, with the Outer Path Ancestral Master still forging the path ahead, promising limitless prospects. Those from the New Life Path, however, felt as if they had fallen into an ice cellar; their hearts sank completely. Now everyone saw that their Ancestral-level figures were nearing the end of their lifespans.

"What fine methods!" A voice came from within the boiling Heavenly Light in the distance. Clearly, Sun Taichu didn't directly clash; merely illuminating the truth of his decay was enough to completely sway the emotions of many.

That Ancestral Master spoke: "What is the New Life Path? At the end of decay, how can one know if there won't be a revival? The sea of mist stretches ahead; who can say that the other side isn't a brand new continent, to be leapt across, leading to a brilliant new life? This path awaits such successors."

However, these words could not ignite the fighting spirit of the new disciples present. They only knew that several Ancestral Masters were dying, and the linen-clad youth was also not a new standard-bearer, with little lifespan left. For those who walked this path, the sky had fallen!

Qin Ming's heart felt heavy. Sun Taichu's gentle illumination with golden radiance, compared to Cao Qianqiu's earth-shaking strike, possessed equally devastating lethality. In the sky, all those blazing suns and scorching suns extinguished and disappeared, clearly indicating no intention of a true grand collision.

Soon, laughter and chatter emerged from Fei Xian Academy. Next, Immortal Seeds would take the stage to discuss their insights; as they were all of similar age, people felt a greater sense of kinship. This was also primarily because they once again felt the glory of this path, and everyone was in a pleasant mood.

People from the Esoteric Path were very calm, for they knew that their Ancestral Masters dared to show great disrespect to deities, possessing truly world-defying power. Those higher-grade heterogeneous beings were also very calm, as the legendary quasi-divine creatures were their predecessors, and thus this path naturally had strong experts.

Even Wu Yaozu muttered softly, "Bro, the New Life Path really isn't working out. It seems the Immortal Path is truly formidable; I should definitely learn from it." He had emerged from the forbidden zone precisely to perfect his "Rainbow Transformation" path, drawing strengths from all other paths.

"Please welcome Cui Chonghe!" A strikingly beautiful female disciple from Fei Xian Academy announced, responsible for hosting the upcoming events.

Cui Chonghe appeared, white mist flowing around him, carrying a faint immortal glow. As he ascended the high platform, he immediately triggered a wave of fervent cheers. As Sun Taichu's closed-door disciple, he naturally received a high degree of attention, focusing everyone's gaze.

"Is this the person who attained enlightenment at three years old? Indeed, he's extraordinary and refined, with a strong immortal aura, like a young banished immortal descended to the world!"
"This is a pinnacle talent of our generation, one of the few standing at the very peak of the pyramid. Among his peers, few can withstand even a single finger of his." Some exclaimed in wonder, and even more gave high praise. Many youths gazed at the figure on the high platform, their eyes shining brightly, filled with immense envy and longing. Some female disciples even shrieked, shouting Cui Chonghe's name.

Cui Chonghe appeared very easygoing. Under the gaze of countless people, he always wore a smile, which was quite similar to his master, Sun Taichu. When he descended the high platform, he almost caused a commotion. Many people wanted to approach him, hoping to get close and interact, but they were quickly stopped by experts from Fei Xian Academy.

"There will be time for everyone to interact later," an old man announced, finally calming the crowd.

Afterward, another Immortal Seed ascended the stage, named Sun Jingxiao. He was valiant and spirited, with an extraordinary bearing, but clearly not as popular as Cui Chonghe.

"It's him," Qin Ming revealed a strange expression. He had seen him while aboard the Vermilion Bird spacecraft and had even gone together to that "place" in the sky to gather various otherworldly essences. He didn't want to recall any further, because he had fallen there, and his entire being had exploded.

Finally, a young girl appeared, immediately causing a great sensation. She had jade skin and an immortal countenance, ethereal and otherworldly, possessing beauty that could topple cities. This was an unparalleled beauty, naturally extremely popular with the youths.

"That's Li Qingyue. She once single-handedly defeated a joint effort by her fellow disciples, rising purely through her own strength. She's a 'near-immortal seed' with extremely high prestige!" someone said, revealing an expression of admiration.
"She truly has beauty, talent, and a future! She's the Heavenly Fairy Maiden of our generation's dreams!" Many praised her, and the place buzzed with discussion.

Li Qingyue, like a dao-flower bud accompanied by white mist, swayed with dazzling radiance in the night, ascending the stage under the gaze of countless people. There, she spoke of her insights, her beautiful voice resounding throughout the venue.

"This chick... she's indeed outstanding, exceptionally remarkable," Wu Yaozu couldn't help but say.

"Watch your words," Qin Ming said.

Wu Yaozu was puzzled. "What's wrong, Bro? I'm just telling the truth. You didn't have any objections when I commented on Sun Jingxiao and Cui Chonghe, so why the double standard now?"

Qin Ming seriously admonished him, "Speaking like that is a bit disrespectful to others. What did your grandma tell you? To know propriety and uphold integrity."

"Grandma, did you really say that?" He lowered his head and looked at the pendant hanging around his neck.

Ultimately, Qin Ming did not go to see Li Qingyue, because at such an exchange event, that area was surrounded by Immortal Path disciples; there were simply too many people. A "near-immortal seed" like her was naturally incredibly dazzling, drawing attention from all sides, the focus of everyone's gaze. A "little transparent" like Qin Ming couldn't push through, and even if he could get close, there wasn't much he could say.

"A beauty like a flower separated by clouds, above the azure sky..." Wu Yaozu was shaking his head back and forth.

"You just came out, what have you learned?" Qin Ming glanced at him.

"Didn't you tell me to read more?" Little Wu retorted.

As the two returned to Mountain River Academy, passing through a stretch of woods, a small golden bird on a branch released its talons, and a piece of letter paper fluttered down, appearing in Qin Ming's hand.

"Hmm?!" He looked up, just in time to see the small bird. It looked very much like the one on Lu Zizai's shoulder, but now it was even smaller! Sensing someone's approach, the small golden bird flashed and vanished into the woods.

"Was it an illusion? Why do I feel like an unfathomable senior just flashed past here?" A purple-eyed crow flew over. Behind it were two more people: a cloaked woman who was exceptionally tall, her entire body shrouded in faint mist, and beside her, a youth with an extraordinary aura.
