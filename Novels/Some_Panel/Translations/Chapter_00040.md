# Chapter 40: Fire Elephant Sword Intent One

Mang Biao didn't force the issue, which put Yang Ji at ease. Delaying the treatment would buy him time to gain the initiative, and perhaps even some benefits.

The welcoming banquet lasted until sunrise before everyone reluctantly dispersed. Before leaving, they didn't forget to smile and bid farewell to Yang Ji, hoping to establish a friendly face and leave a good impression. Yang Ji also smiled and responded to each of them. Even if his body was in Cao's camp but his heart was with Han, he wouldn't show it; he had to keep up appearances.

After everyone left, Mang Biao said he'd arrange lodging for Yang Ji and led him to a quiet room behind the main hall. Opening the window revealed the ocean view. Far from the bustling front hall, it was quiet and comfortable, perfectly suiting Yang Ji's preferences.

"Little brother, I know you like peace and quiet, so I brought you to the back hall. Beyond this is a sheer cliff, so generally no one will disturb you here. If you need anything in the future, don't hesitate to ask; you don't need to be polite with your elder brother," Mang Biao said with a hearty laugh.

"Mm," Yang Ji glanced at him, nodding faintly.

"Then, little brother, rest and recuperate at ease. Your elder brother won't disturb you," Mang Biao smiled and exited the room.

Yang Ji glanced at the door, paused for a moment, and made no move as he pondered. Instead, he consumed a Demonic Essence Pill and began to cultivate. At night, he comprehended the Sword Dao Imprint and cultivated the Humanoid Weapon. Three days passed in this manner.

On this particular night, taking advantage of Mang Biao's relaxed vigilance, Yang Ji pushed open his door and quietly soared into the sky. But just as he flew out of the island, his vision flickered, and a person suddenly appeared before him. At such speed, blocking him in the blink of an eye, who else could it be but Mang Biao?

"Cough, cough, little brother, are you bored from cultivation and came out for some fresh air? What a coincidence, the moonlight is beautiful tonight, and I've brought wine. How about we enjoy the moon together high up in the sky?" Mang Biao said, holding up a wine pot.

"This guy is indeed secretly monitoring me. It seems escaping stealthily won't work," Yang Ji frowned inwardly, glanced at Mang Biao, and calmly smiled, "No, I'm just practicing my flight technique. Maybe next time."

After turning around, he flew back to his room. For the next few days, he would look for an opportunity to slip away every day. But every time he was about to fly out of the island, Mang Biao would stop him with a bright smile on his face. Yang Ji knew he had been placed under house arrest by Mang Biao. He truly wasn't free. He was quite vexed. Although he had good food and drink served to him on the island, the inability to leave was a headache. After several attempts, he gave up. It seemed quietly escaping was not an option.

Another five days passed consecutively. That night, a knock came from Yang Ji's door: "Daoist brother, are you in?"

"Golden Abacus?" Hearing this, Yang Ji suddenly opened his eyes, feeling indignant. "Golden Abacus, you bastard, you finally showed up." Getting up to open the door, he yanked Golden Abacus inside, his face dark, and questioned him:

"You're such a blabbermouth! Couldn't you have just traded properly? Why did you tell people my alchemy skills were better than Chang Yuan's? Now this brute thinks I'm an alchemy master and has placed me under house arrest! Hurry up and get your Jin family's three Golden Core Ancestors to rescue me!"

Golden Abacus said with a wronged expression, "Sigh, I didn't think that much at the time. Besides, I didn't reveal your existence; I only said that the person who refined this Demon Lure Pill was no worse than Chang Yuan. I didn't expect them to start plotting against you. These guys, secretly tracking me, how sneaky!"

Yang Ji took a deep breath, but then hesitated to speak, finally sighing lightly, "It seems I'm still not cautious enough. I should move around more often and not stay in one place for too long."

Golden Abacus weakly said, "It's no use if you move places; they're tracking me. Unless you stop trading with me, they'll always find you."

"It seems that with too many transactions, being targeted is inevitable. My strength is still not enough," Yang Ji exhaled.

"So what now? Are we still trading?" Golden Abacus asked.

"Trade, of course we trade. I'm already in enough trouble on Black Wind Island; can it get any worse, like being abducted by a Nascent Soul True Monarch? You go ahead and trade boldly," Yang Ji said calmly, appearing like a dead pig unafraid of boiling water.

"Alright, here's some Demon Affinity Grass for you. I'm out of Demon Lure Pills, so refine a few batches. I'll stay here tonight," Golden Abacus said, handing over the Demon Affinity Grass.

Completely oblivious, Golden Abacus didn't notice Yang Ji's face had already darkened. Three breaths later, Golden Abacus finally realized Yang Ji was glaring furiously at him.

"Daoist brother, you—"

"My head, your head! You're staying here? Hurry up and call your Jin family ancestors to come rescue me!" Yang Ji glared at him furiously.

"Cough, cough, about that..." Golden Abacus scratched his head, feeling a bit guilty. "Truth be told, our Jin family are just businessmen. We probably won't get into a conflict with Mang Biao for your sake, after all, he's a Golden Core Master, so..."

"So I'm on my own?" Yang Ji squinted at him.

"Probably," Golden Abacus said with a fawning smile. "Daoist brother, you have food and lodging here, protection, and you've even become the second island master. Just enjoy it; there's no need to be so troubled."

Yang Ji gave him a sideways glance and then directly kicked him out of the room.

Time flew by; ten days passed in a flash. And just as Golden Abacus had said, Yang Ji, aside from being unable to leave the island, had good food and drink and was highly respected. Yang Ji had no choice but to slowly adapt to his situation. During the day, he wholeheartedly consumed Demonic Essence Pills to increase his cultivation, while at night, he cultivated the Humanoid Weapon and comprehended the Sword Dao Imprint.

One more night, after consuming a Demonic Essence Pill and allowing the spiritual energy vortex to refine it on its own, he then took out the Sword Dao Imprint jade slip with a backhand motion, preparing to continue his comprehension. The Humanoid Weapon was a great divine ability, and the reason he could grasp it so quickly was that it had existing scriptures to comprehend. The Sword Dao Imprint, however, was different. It only contained a segment of sword practice footage, within which only faint traces of sword dao intent were contained, making it very difficult to comprehend its profound mysteries.

At this moment, Yang Ji's spiritual sense once again delved into the jade slip, peering into its secrets. First to appear before his eyes was a middle-aged man holding a flowing light longsword. He wore robes as white as snow, looked refined and handsome, with a serene and gentle smile. His entire being exuded a spiritual aura, much like an enlightened immortal, giving off an unworldly and carefree immortal charm.

Yet, this seemingly gentle and refined middle-aged cultivator, at the moment he drew his sword, seemed to erupt with endless sword qi between his brows, causing his aura to change dramatically. His body became as sharp as a keen sword, as if it could pierce through the firmament. He made his move, only one strike. With a single sword slash, tens of thousands of sword qi transformed into a massive, dazzling silver rainbow, sweeping clouds for a thousand miles, cutting across the sky, full of domineering power and unstoppable force.

Yang Ji had watched this single move for an entire year and practiced it for an entire year. Despite having the 'Golden Finger' for error correction, his execution of the sword move already possessed a considerable spiritual charm, yet he hadn't grasped even one-tenth of the sword dao intent contained within that single strike.
