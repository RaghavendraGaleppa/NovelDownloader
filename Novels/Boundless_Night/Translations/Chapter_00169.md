# Chapter 169: Long Journey

Qin Ming was lost in thought. In the latter half of the night, he had ventured into the Netherworld and paused by the Celestial Palace – what a strange experience that was. Although it was all an illusion, he still savored the memory. He looked up at the window; the night in the real world was so profoundly dark.

"A centipede dies but never stiffens. Even after being hunted for four days with the sun high, a wisp of its residual spirit could remain." Qin Ming mused that his experience tonight had been quite dangerous. The giant centipede itself was very weak, but the altar it manipulated was far from simple. If he had unknowingly stepped onto it, the consequences would have been unimaginable. He guessed he would have been sacrificed, and that creature might have taken his place. A wave of fear washed over him. In this world enveloped by dense night fog, were similar things happening elsewhere? If he thought about it deeply, it truly made one feel insecure.

Qin Ming picked up the palm-sized golden scale armor. It felt heavy in his hand, heavier than even metal. He carefully studied the dense, tiny characters. The more he read, the brighter his eyes became, until sparks seemed to dance within them, and his mind felt like it was about to sink into the text. He quickly put it down and calmed himself, afraid of suddenly resonating with it and suffering a "severe blow." Before, he had a painful experience. At the ruins of Luofu Immortal Mountain, he was once struck by a seemingly ordinary but "terrifying" emotion left behind by a certain venerable elder, leaving his mind blank as if struck by lightning. Without a doubt, this shimmering golden scale armor belonged to a Single Page of True Legacy; its value was immeasurable!

The more Qin Ming looked, the more excited he became, his gaze incredibly fervent. He took a deep breath, adjusted his state, and only after thorough preparation did he attempt to resonate with it. If anything felt wrong, he would immediately stop. The scripture on the scale armor pertained to the path of esoteric sects, starting with divine insight, profound and unfathomable. As expected, the emotions it carried were extremely complex, inevitably involving an unfathomable venerable elder whose demeanor was light and easy, yet their emotions were too "terrifying." Even with ample preparation, Qin Ming was still shaken until his head spun, nearly fainting. This was after attempting it many times in increments. If the text on the golden scale armor hadn't abruptly cut off partway through, he wouldn't have wanted to attempt this resonance at all, even though his talent allowed him to comprehend it. Because it was truly too painful; his consciousness was almost scattered.

Finally, Qin Ming's forehead was covered in cold sweat, and he was nearly exhausted. The scripture was finally "complete," though a full inheritance should consist of two pieces of golden scale armor. Despite his extreme mental fatigue, he wore a satisfied smile. This night, his bizarre spiritual wandering had brought him immense gains. Undoubtedly, this scripture was a Sect-suppressing ultimate art!

After Qin Ming recovered, he immediately tried practicing it. He felt the effects were excellent, truly worthy of content from a Single Page of True Legacy. Overall, this scripture was more potent than the thin booklet given to him by Meng Xinghai's grand-uncle-master. After all, that was just something the elder casually gifted him for initial practice; it was impossible to give him the sect's highest cultivation method upon their first meeting.

Soon, the smile on Qin Ming's face gradually faded. Because the divine insight he cultivated was absorbed, feeding back into his physical body, still an unsolvable situation. "Is this because the Silk Scripture art is too overbearing, absorbing everything, or because I've practiced it for over a decade, making my flesh and blood most compatible with it?" This left Qin Ming with no other choice but to go all the way down this path. Practicing the scripture from the Single Page of True Legacy changed nothing; it was still the same as before, only usable to aid the Path of Rebirth. Qin Ming studied it for a long time, finally accepting reality. It was still early before dawn, so he lay down and continued to sleep.

The next day, he woke up early, first practicing the Fate-Altering Scripture, followed by Five-Thunder Organ Refinement. These internal strengthening techniques could extend life and improve talent, and he diligently persisted in them daily without interruption. Afterward, Qin Ming went to see Meng Xinghai, and also invited Li Qingyun over.

"Are you departing soon?"

"Kunling is a place full of legends. Although it borders the Three Great Dynasties of Yu, Qian, and Rui, they dare not claim it, fearing trouble. In the end, some old fellows instead established their orthodoxies there." Both spoke one after another, knowing Qin Ming was about to embark on a long journey.

"I have good things to give to Uncle Meng and Grandfather Li. Thank you for looking after me."

"The golden rhino horn tea set and wine set you brought back last time were nice. What else are you giving us?" Both were surprised and a little curious.

"This time, it's a significant gift," Qin Ming said. Who boasts their own gift as "significant"? Both immediately realized that what he was giving them was probably extraordinary. In front of them, Qin Ming fetched paper and ink, then meticulously wrote out the scripture from the golden scale armor, character by character. Both men approached to watch, progressing from initial confusion, to grave expressions, then to inner shock, and finally, completely petrified, utterly stunned.

"Such a scripture..." They weren't people who hadn't seen the world, yet they were still somewhat dazed. This absolutely belonged to a secretly transmitted, sect-suppressing scripture. A young boy writing so furiously, just like that, writing it out for them? Both felt that this was truly quite dreamlike, too unreal.

Soon, they cast aside distracting thoughts and were deeply engrossed, not even blinking, dedicating their full attention to it.

"Marvelous! This scripture is extraordinary. If I can cross-reference it with what I've learned, it might solve problems that have troubled me for a long time and help me break through." After an unknown period, Meng Xinghai awoke and couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.

Li Qingyun's expression was even more solemn. He said, "Little Qin, where did you obtain this scripture?" He was all too aware of the value of these characters; they simply couldn't circulate in the outside world. Even in the most top-tier dao fields, they were considered secret transmissions.

Qin Ming put down his pen, his expression also turning serious. He said, "Last night, I was attacked and pulled into a dense black mist..." He recounted his experience, still finding many aspects puzzling. Both men's expressions changed. That giant centipede hadn't completely died and still wanted revenge – this was truly far beyond their expectations.

"That was the old centipede's Divine Kingdom, but it had been breached by someone. The black mist area is very mysterious; people on the Path of Rebirth generally find it difficult to enter, unless they reach the later stages and become venerable elders with sufficiently powerful consciousness."

"In fact, even for people on other paths, only experts can access that domain. Ordinary people don't understand it at all, or haven't even heard of it." Through their conversation, Qin Ming realized that every path held many secrets. Those in lower realms simply couldn't know, nor could they comprehend how vast and boundless the scenery at higher levels was, like ants gazing at the sky.

"That was close! That altar was definitely not simple. The old centipede actually wanted to revive from death. Beings with the potential to become gods are indeed extraordinarily complex. It's good that you're safe, Little Qin." After this exchange, Qin Ming increasingly felt that the entire Night Fog World was overly dangerous, containing too many unknowns. To protect oneself, one could only continuously grow stronger.

Then, discussing his distant journey, Qin Ming decided to depart in two days.

"I'll see you off," Li Qingyun said with a smile.

"No need, Grandfather Li, I'll travel by myself." Qin Ming felt uneasy always bothering the elder. He wasn't some noble young master who needed experts to escort him even when traveling. The Night Fog World was so vast; he could simply set off quietly. It would be better to venture out on his own.

"Chixia City is a full twenty thousand *li* from Kunling. That's truly not close. Let me take you there, don't be a stranger," Li Qingyun said. Qin Ming planned to travel alone because he wanted to carefully observe this vast Night Fog World.

Meng Xinghai spoke up, "How about this, I'll make the arrangements. Little Qin, traveling alone for such a long distance, the dark lands are far from as peaceful as you imagine. Some areas are extremely dangerous, even we have to detour around them. If you unknowingly stumble into one, something will definitely happen." He informed him that he could travel by airship. Although its speed wasn't very fast, one could enjoy the scenery along the way, learn about local customs, and consider it an experience.

"A spirit boat?" Qin Ming asked.

"Not the kind of ship that requires spiritual consciousness to power it." Meng Xinghai shook his head.

Li Qingyun chuckled, "I've heard of them. They appeared two years ago and only matured half a year ago. They are said to be the painstaking creation of an elder from the Heavenly Craftsmanship Academy and can finally be mass-produced."

Meng Xinghai nodded and said, "Yes, primarily, they discovered an unusual tree in the pioneering frontier regions and began utilizing it." More precisely, people from the Heavenly Craftsmanship Academy discovered a completely new energy source deep within the Night Fog World. The unusual trees were quite special; a fist-sized piece of wood could weigh ten *jin*, while slightly higher-grade silver wood could weigh twenty to thirty *jin*. As for higher grades, such as unusual trees with a faint golden hue throughout, they were not only heavier but could also emit various spiritual substances comparable to fire springs. Qin Ming was surprised. No wonder the high-level figures wanted extensive pioneering; there were simply too many good things deep within the Night Fog World.

"Furthermore, traveling by that kind of ship has another benefit: occasionally, one can absorb 'Celestial Radiance' from the depths of the night sky." The venerable elders from the Outer Realm Immortal Lands no longer needed food; they could feast on mist and rinse with dew, and "rinsing with dew" specifically referred to drinking the 'Celestial Radiance' from high altitudes.

Two days later, Qin Ming quietly set off and arrived at Qixia City, eight hundred *li* away. Although their names differed by only one character, the scale of the two cities was incomparable. Qixia City was a true metropolis, extremely famous. From afar, one could see brilliant light piercing through the night fog, illuminating the entire area. This was because only such famous cities had airship landings; Chixia City hadn't been popularized yet. Qixia City had direct routes to Kunling.

Qin Ming, holding his ticket, had arrived at Qixia City's airship embarkation point. He was surprised to find many young people waiting for ships here, likely, like him, heading to distant places for study. Enveloped by night fog, the area here was vast, with many huge airships awaiting departure.

"Brothers, no need to ask. Most of the people waiting for ships here at this time are heading to Kunling. Even if we'll enter different academies or dao fields, we're still considered the same cohort." A young man laughed, saying this was the student enrollment season, and since they were all of similar age, the journey would certainly not be lonely.

"The journey was never going to be uneventful. Guess who I just saw? That ruthless fellow who swept through eighty-one cities is waiting in the VIP lounge; he's also heading to Kunling."

"No way, he's going there?" The young men and women here were mostly under twenty, and most were lively, with all sorts of topics of conversation.

"What's that? Even the Pure Yang Body, said to be most suitable for venturing into the Outer Realm, is reportedly heading to Kunling this time." Immediately, many exclaimed in surprise: Why would the Pure Yang Body choose this?

"Kunling is not weak at all. The patrons behind some academies are actually pioneers from the Outer Realm!" a cheerful young girl said.

"Actually, there's another hidden reason. The major dao fields and academies in Kunling are preparing to jointly explore the outer regions of a forbidden zone. There, an extremely high-level auspicious beast resides, whose blood can alter one's fundamental bone structure, enough to allow us to achieve nirvana..." As soon as this secret news came out, it immediately caused an uproar, and the group of young people became excited. Since they were about to head to Kunling, would they also have a chance to obtain a little blood from the auspicious beast?

"Don't overthink it. Among our current cohort, only the heaven-defying prodigies from various paths, the select few ranked at the top, will have a chance to obtain such a great fortune." According to speculation, each dao field and academy would have a few quotas.

"What's that? Descendants of some giants from the Outer Realm Immortal Lands and Yang Lands have already gone there. One can imagine how much commotion this hunt for the auspicious beast has stirred up."

Qin Ming listened quietly, feeling that Kunling was far from peaceful, and he could indeed sit back and watch the winds of change gather.
