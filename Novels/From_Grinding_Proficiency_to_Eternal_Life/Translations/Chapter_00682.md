# Chapter 682: Driving Tigers to Devour Wolves, A Clash Where the Snipe and the Clam Fight

"The Heavenly Dao of this world has a special origin. It favors the native deities while suppressing and repelling outsiders. Chiyang and Tongxuan are currently being targeted by the Heavenly Dao, plagued by misfortune, their mana circulation sluggish, and now they are besieged by the three main gods. The timing, the terrain, and the people—all are on our side!"

He paced to the edge of the courtyard, naturally sensing the aftershocks from the three main gods' attacks. In fact, it wasn't just him; every deity in Atila could sense it clearly.

But their status was what it was. Apart from the three main gods, any other deity who dared approach wouldn't even be able to enter the core area; a single aftershock would mean their demise.

Although for Atila, Chiyang and Tongxuan were merely external True Lords, extremely far from the power transmission of the Dao Fruit of the Taihua Lingxu Realm, and could only rely on themselves, they were, after all, True Lords who had attained the Dao Fruit through their internal grotto-heavens, having formed their own cycles with an endless supply of mana, greatly reducing their dependence on the world.

Even though this world obstructed them from heaven to earth, for a True Lord, it was nothing more than a small stumbling block. Even the Heavenly Dao of the Taihua Lingxu Realm could do nothing against these parasites, let alone Atila, whose status was several levels lower.

But even so, with the two True Lords being resisted and besieged by this world's Heavenly Dao, which generously empowered the three main gods, the two would not have an easy time.

"Although the three main gods only grasp the皮毛 (superficial aspects) of authority, possessing the Dao Fruit but not comprehending the true essence of the Great Dao, with the support of the local Heavenly Dao, the combined power of the three is no weaker than a mid-stage Golden Core True Lord. Previously, Dongming True Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect was discovered by the God of Light due to a moment of carelessness and almost died here. These people are too greedy; instead of reporting such a great world to the Pudu True Lord, they only think of monopolizing it."

Zhang Ziyang shook his head slightly and continued, "Even though Chiyang and Tongxuan are peerless in slaughter as sword cultivators, having lost the advantage of timing and terrain here, and being suppressed by the Heavenly Dao, they will surely be severely wounded in a prolonged battle. This is driving tigers to devour wolves, a clash where the snipe and the clam fight!"

Zhang Ziyang suddenly turned, his gaze burning as he stared at Xu Yunfan. "And you, possessing the divine spark of a native deity, are naturally favored by this world's Heavenly Dao. You can strike with thunderous force at the critical moment. The rules of heaven and earth will all assist you. As the saying goes, when the time comes, heaven and earth will work together. The Liguang Ranyan Chiyang Dao Fruit is similar in nature to your Shenxiao Dao Fruit. If you can seize and refine it, yang fire will give birth to yang thunder, enough for you to rapidly advance to the peak of the early Golden Core stage, or even glimpse the threshold of the mid-stage. Isn't such a gift delivered to your doorstep a sign of immense fortune?"

A single Liguang Ranyan Chiyang Dao Fruit might not allow Xu Yunfan to advance to the mid-stage, but it could greatly increase his own cultivation. If he could obtain it, with the intertwining of thunder and fire, and the assistance of his attribute panel, he was confident he would be the number one person in this situation.

Purple-gold lightning flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. Zhang Ziyang's analysis coincided with his own thoughts. He said in a deep voice, "What the Sect Master says is absolutely right. It's just that Tongxuan's sword soul is insidiously venomous and cunning, and he is also skilled in escape. If he is allowed to escape, the future troubles will be endless. With my strength alone, I'm afraid it will be difficult to keep both of them at once."

After a pause, Xu Yunfan continued, "However, I can be sure that someone will become my backup plan."

Zhang Ziyang stroked his beard and smiled. "No matter. Although this poor Daoist has not formed a Golden Core, this world is the foundation of my Incense Path. Where my divine sense reaches, with the support of the Heavenly Dao network and the power of billions of believers, I can still manage to investigate, warn, restrain, and interfere. You only need to lock onto Chiyang and deliver that certain-kill strike. If Tongxuan escapes, there will be a backup plan to deal with him. It's just, are you sure that backup plan will make a move?"

A hint of a smile appeared on Xu Yunfan's face. "Sect Master, you don't know the True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect; each one is selfish and self-serving. With their character, how could they possibly miss out on such an opportunity after suffering a loss? She took my benefits, knows the coordinates of this world, and even desires to covet the God of Darkness's Eternal Night Sinking Dao Fruit. Now that Chiyang and Tongxuan are heavily wounded by the three main gods, it's a heaven-sent opportunity. How could she miss it? Although she has already fled in the sea of realms, I dare say that Dongming is definitely lurking on the side, waiting for an opportunity. If she doesn't make a move, she can forget about having any share of the God of Darkness's Dao Fruit."

That Dongming True Lord specialized in the secret arts of karma, and the Dongming Eroding Heaven Talisman was among the top secret arts of the Primordial Origin Sect, so she would naturally be involved in it. With Xu Yunfan's mastery of the Dongming Eroding Heaven Talisman at the Great Perfection realm, he would naturally have a subtle sense of her. This woman appeared to have fled, but in reality, she had hidden herself within this world. She was a sinister one.

Just as Xu Yunfan and Zhang Ziyang had anticipated, the distant battlefield had reached a fever pitch, even becoming brutal.

"Pfft!"

True Lord Chiyang spat out a mouthful of magma-like blood. He had been struck hard on the back by a ten-thousand-zhang ancient vine summoned by the Lord of Nature, Orian. The vine, entwined with the Dao Fruit of All Things' Life, was not only terrifyingly powerful but also carried a strange vitality that eroded his Dao foundation, burning his insides. If the Fenji Sword hadn't returned in time to block and deflect most of the force, this single blow would have severely wounded him. But under the Heavenly Dao's suppression, his movements being half a beat too slow was the main cause.

True Lord Tongxuan was in an even worse state. His left shoulder was covered in a sheet of dark ice crystals, the cold air penetrating deep into his bones, the result of a sneak attack by the God of Darkness, Ymir. The power of the Eternal Night Sinking Dao Fruit continuously eroded his sword soul's Dao foundation, trying to drag him into eternal oblivion. The nine intangible sword souls were already covered in fine cracks, their movement becoming increasingly difficult. The misfortune brought by this world's Heavenly Dao was like a shadow; a remnant of holy light that should have landed on the God of Light's head, due to an inexplicable spatial fluctuation, instead blasted straight towards his face.

If they didn't go all out now, the outcome would surely be defeat and death. Even though the two were sword cultivators, hailed as peerless in slaughter, when faced with the targeting of an entire world, they were still powerless.

"Liguang Ranyan, burn the eight wastelands to ashes! Break for me!"

True Lord Chiyang went completely mad. The Liguang Ranyan Chiyang Dao Fruit burned without regard for the consequences. A terrifying wave of heat that could scorch the heavens and boil the seas erupted from his body, temporarily burning through the sticky feeling of the Heavenly Dao's suppression. The Fenji Sword let out a blood-weeping wail, its blade crimson and ready to drip. A ten-thousand-zhang magma giant sword, condensed to the extreme as if it could melt the barriers of the realm, suddenly slashed out, its target directly pointing at the God of Light, Orian, who posed the greatest threat to him. This was a strike fueled by burning his Dao Fruit's origin.

"Xuanshu Returns to Ruin, Ten Thousand Swords Become One!"

True Lord Tongxuan also knew they had reached a life-and-death juncture, a trace of ruthlessness flashing in his eyes. The power of the Tianji Xuanshu Sword Soul Dao Fruit was poured into the nine cracked sword souls without regard for loss. The nine swords instantly split into thousands, transforming into a storm of profound ice sword rain that froze the void and cut through all things, its target being the Lord of Nature, Orian, who had transformed into thousands and was everywhere. He would use quantity to fight quantity, using extreme cold to freeze the breath of life.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!!!

Chiyang's world-burning giant sword fiercely cleaved into the God of Light's holy light shield. The terrifying explosion instantly vaporized the clouds for ten thousand miles around. The holy light shield shattered with a loud crash. The God of Light, Orian, let out a pained groan, his divine body's light dimming; he had clearly suffered a significant shock.

Meanwhile, Tongxuan's profound ice sword rain storm fiercely tangled with the endless vine forest summoned by the Lord of Nature, Orian.
