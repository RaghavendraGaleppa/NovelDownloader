# Chapter 134: Bait and the Magnetic Treasure Mirror

The person bowing respectfully was none other than Su Huazheng, who had been defeated by Gu Yuan at the Liuyun Banquet. His request appeared earnest, but his malicious intent was unmistakable.

This was a classic case of setting someone up for a fall.

"Enough! Su Huazheng, stop pretending! Senior Brother Gu has only been at Foundation Establishment for a year. His role in this campaign is to assist the senior brothers—how could he possibly defeat the Emerald Fire Water-Eyed Ape?" Ma Wu, standing beside Gu Yuan, immediately rose to refute Su's words.

Su Jingming, with thirty years of cultivation and a superior magic artifact, had barely escaped with his life. No matter how talented Gu Yuan was, how could he possibly defeat such a natural-born monstrosity in such a short time? Though Gu Yuan had offended the Su family, Ma Wu never expected them to resort to such underhanded tactics during a joint campaign against a common enemy.

"Senior Brother Gu is a true genius, his talent unparalleled. A single year of his cultivation equals decades of ours—how could ordinary folk comprehend this? If not for his extraordinary abilities, how could he have single-handedly triumphed in the Ancient Yue Secret Realm? You, a mediocre talent who barely reached Foundation Establishment at nearly fifty, have no right to question his prowess. Among all present, if anyone can defeat that Emerald Fire Water-Eyed Ape, it is Senior Brother Gu—unless he is so heartless as to watch Senior Brother Ji's corpse be devoured without lifting a finger!" Su Huazheng first lavished praise on Gu Yuan, then sighed dramatically, fixing his gaze on him.

"Indeed! Senior Brother Gu's brilliance is unmatched—he will surely defeat that beast!"
"To obtain nine spiritual energies alone and establish his own faction as a commoner—such unprecedented genius must prevail over a mere beast!"
"Senior Brother Gu will certainly succeed!"
"We believe in Senior Brother Gu!"

From the Su family's side, multiple Foundation Establishment cultivators chimed in, heaping exaggerated praise on Gu Yuan. Even those from the seven noble lineages whom Gu Yuan had previously defeated remained silent but watched him intently.

"Enough! If you wish to retrieve the corpse, go yourselves! Stop pressuring Senior Brother Gu!" Ma Wu roared in anger. Fu Hongling and others also spoke up, rebuking the noble families.

"If we had obtained nine spiritual energies like Senior Brother Gu, we would have already slaughtered our way through the demonic hordes! Why would we need to beg him now?"
"Alas, our academy painstakingly nurtured a genius, bestowing nine spiritual energies upon him so he could shoulder great responsibilities and protect his fellow disciples. Yet now, a single demon ape bars our path, forcing us to watch as our comrade's corpse is devoured..."

Su Huazheng sighed mournfully, shaking his head, though a cold glint flickered in his eyes. When his uncle had returned grievously wounded despite wielding a superior magic artifact, Su Huazheng had sensed trouble. Without his uncle's strength, their campaign against the Chiyue Great River would suffer, and their plans to eliminate their enemies would be delayed. The only solution was to drag Gu Yuan into the fray through an overt scheme.

"Senior Brother Gu, no matter how talented, cannot grow overnight. If you wish to go, go yourselves and retrieve the corpse!" Ma Wu snapped.

"Our Su family has already fought two battles, with my uncle severely wounded—have we not done enough?"
"If I weren't Senior Brother Gu's defeated opponent, I would have gone already!" Su Huazheng turned sharply, his tone righteous and indignant.

Ma Wu faltered. The Su family had indeed contributed significantly—he could hardly argue otherwise. He glanced at Gu Yuan, only to find him sitting calmly in meditation, utterly unmoved by the provocation. Relieved, Ma Wu sat back down.

"Senior Brother Gu's composure is unshakable—he won't act rashly over mere words. I worried for nothing." He chuckled inwardly and fell silent.

Seeing this, Su Huazheng grew anxious and looked toward Yin Xingchao at the head of the assembly. But Yin Xingchao remained impassive. In battle, one could only volunteer—he would never assign such a task. Moreover, he saw through Su Huazheng's ploy immediately and closed his eyes, focusing on dispersing the Earthly Fiend Heavenly Water Formation.

"Does mere camaraderie not move Senior Brother Gu to act? Very well—I offer a mid-grade magic artifact! If Senior Brother Gu returns victorious, this artifact shall be his!" Su Huazheng's expression shifted before he gritted his teeth and produced a palm-sized jade mirror from his sleeve.

"This is the Magnetic Treasure Mirror. It suppresses all metal-based artifacts—any weapon or seal containing metallic properties will be severely weakened by it. Were it not bound to my spirit, preventing immediate transfer, I would gift it to you outright. But if you venture forth to reclaim Senior Brother Ji's remains, I, Su Huazheng, swear to do everything in my power to aid you!" He raised the mirror, his eyes brimming with feigned sorrow, and bowed deeply to Gu Yuan.

"Pathetic theatrics," Ma Wu muttered. This was nothing but an attempt to force Gu Yuan into a corner. Thankfully, his senior brother's resolve was unshaken.

Yet just then, a clear voice rang out:

"Senior Brother Ji died for our academy. Retrieving his remains is our duty—I would have acted even without your request, Su Huazheng. I will not allow his body to be defiled by demons. However, since you offer an artifact as incentive, I accept. I shall slay this beast and honor your 'request.'" With that, Gu Yuan stood, bowed to Yin Xingchao, and strode calmly from the airship.

"Senior Brother Gu! Don't do this!"
"Stop! This is folly!" Ma Wu cried out in alarm. Fu Hongling also leaped to her feet, urgently pleading. But Gu Yuan had already transformed into a streak of light, vanishing into the clouds above.

In truth, Gu Yuan had no desire for such petty confrontations. Lately, he had begun to recognize flaws in his approach to cultivation. He had become entangled in the academy's factional struggles and resource disputes. Since the Liuyun Banquet, he had fixated on securing the academy's resources. Yet with the Stone Liquid at his disposal, the world was vast—there were countless ways to obtain resources beyond the academy's confines.

This campaign against the Chiyue Great River could have been an opportunity to quietly seek fortunes with the Stone Liquid, avoiding unnecessary battles. Even without the Great River, he could have traveled the land, seeking opportunities elsewhere. The Stone Liquid was his greatest asset. Needlessly involving himself in noble family conflicts was unwise—steadily accumulating strength in the shadows was the true path to power.

But spiritual energies were rare, and his previous actions had already drawn attention. Since the past could not be undone, he might as well resolve these conflicts decisively and cultivate in peace afterward.

The Magnetic Treasure Mirror, a mid-grade artifact with formidable power, was equivalent to a stroke of fortune—a worthy price for his intervention. 

Very well. He would fight this battle, test his mettle against the legendary Emerald Fire Water-Eyed Ape, and establish his reputation—paving the way for future endeavors.
