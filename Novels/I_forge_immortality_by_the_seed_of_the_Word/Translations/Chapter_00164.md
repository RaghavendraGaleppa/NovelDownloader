**Chapter 161: Senior Brother Ge Qingshen**  

Zhang Jing was about to speak, but before he could utter a single word, Qu Junhou beside him cut in first.  

"Fellow Daoist from the Zhou Tian Star Temple, don't be so quick to call us junior brothers. What if it turns out you're the junior here? Wouldn't that be awkward?"  

"You!"  

The man opposite them flashed a trace of anger across his face, the warmth in his eyes instantly replaced by icy coldness. Behind him, the man and woman accompanying him stepped forward, glaring furiously at Qu Junhou.  

Unfazed, Qu Junhou grinned, revealing a row of gleaming white teeth, and taunted in an infuriating tone, "What, you think numbers make you special? I could take on ten of you!"  

As he spoke, threads of annihilating energy seeped from his body, carrying an aura of absolute destruction. In an instant, the expressions of the man and woman before him twisted from indignation to fear.  

Observing this, the leader of the trio narrowed his eyes and stepped forward. His body surged with cold, violent stellar mana as a phantom crimson star rose behind his head, radiating waves of murderous intent. The air grew thick with a faintly sweet, metallic scent.  

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing acted as though he hadn't noticed the tension between Qu Junhou and the three opponents. His gaze remained calm as he addressed the white-robed Golden Core woman, asking softly,  

"Fellow Daoist, you still haven’t answered my question—how much does it cost to rent a palace?"  

His voice seemed to shatter the tense atmosphere between Qu Junhou and the Zhou Tian Star Temple disciples.  

Instantly, all eyes turned to the Golden Core woman.  

*Gulp—*  

Under their scrutiny, she swallowed nervously, her expression frozen. Though she was a Golden Core cultivator—higher in cultivation than any of the five before her—that did nothing to ease her anxiety.  

After all, she had heard every word they’d exchanged.  

One side belonged to the Supreme Infinite Dao Sect, the other to the Zhou Tian Star Temple—both were pinnacle human factions, teeming with immortal deities and mighty beings. Even mere Foundation Establishment disciples from such sects were far beyond her ability to offend.  

Meeting Zhang Jing’s gaze, she opened her mouth but failed to utter a sound, her face on the verge of tears.  

A flicker of understanding passed through Zhang Jing’s eyes. After a brief pause, he spoke calmly,  

"Everything should follow the principle of first come, first served. Just follow the rules—you needn’t worry about anything. As for those three from the Zhou Tian Star Temple, if they have any complaints, they can take them up with me. You won’t be implicated."  

His voice carried unwavering confidence.  

Hearing this, the white-robed woman bit her lip lightly, a hint of resolve flashing in her eyes.  

*Right!*  

She was only following protocol. Surely, the three Zhou Tian Star Temple disciples wouldn’t hold it against her.  

Of course, Zhang Jing’s assurance played a significant role—not because of his promise, but because she sensed the underlying message.  

If she followed the rules, she might offend the three disciples, but they, bound by their status, wouldn’t dare retaliate against her.  

But if she didn’t…  

A sweet smile quickly bloomed on her face. She glanced apologetically at the trio before turning back to Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou.  

"Honored guests, the Jiaoyun Secret Realm will last three months, and there are still half a month before it begins. That means you’ll need to rent for three and a half months—3.5 million Immortal Crystals per person."  

"Immortal Crystals? Can’t we use destiny points?" Qu Junhou asked, eyes wide with surprise.  

"My apologies, honored guests," the woman replied, her voice growing quieter. "Unlike the Ten Thousand Realms Auction House or major secret realms, we don’t accept destiny points—only Immortal Crystals. If you don’t have any, you could exchange for them at the auction house, but… the one in Jiaoyun Immortal City was temporarily closed recently and hasn’t reopened yet."  

Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou exchanged blank looks.  

*No destiny points?*  

Neither of them had ever left the Supreme Infinite Dao Sect since arriving in the Clear Void Profound Heaven. Aside from cultivating in their cave abodes, they had only visited the Radiant Light Immortal World to purchase legacies and resources.  

In other words, they had no idea that ordinary factions and cultivators in the Heavenly Realm used Immortal Crystals instead of the esoteric destiny points.  

"Brother Zhang, what do we do?" Qu Junhou asked helplessly.  

Zhang Jing, however, had already regained his composure. He gave Qu Junhou a reassuring glance.  

Did the closure of the Jiaoyun Immortal City’s auction house affect his ability to exchange for Immortal Crystals?  

Meanwhile—  

"Hahaha! Since you two junior brothers lack Immortal Crystals, this senior brother will humbly accept the palaces instead!"  

The three Zhou Tian Star Temple disciples couldn’t hide their delight.  

Who would’ve thought these two Supreme Infinite Dao Sect disciples didn’t even know what Immortal Crystals were? And to make matters worse, the auction house was conveniently closed!  

But their joy lasted only a few breaths.  

Their expressions froze as Zhang Jing pulled out a small golden talisman—emblazoned with the unmistakable insignia of the Ten Thousand Realms Auction House.  

"...Is that… an auction house VIP Golden Talisman?"  

The leader of the trio recognized it instantly, his heart pounding in shock.  

Then came confusion.  

*Why would a mere Foundation Establishment disciple possess such a thing?*  

The auction house was backed by the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect, another top-tier faction. They had no reason—nor would they ever—to curry favor with the Supreme Infinite Dao Sect by gifting such a precious item to a lowly Foundation Establishment disciple.  

Unless…  

The auction house was honoring someone behind this disciple.  

And in the Profound Yellow World, the number of beings who could command such respect from the auction house was vanishingly small—each one a legendary figure.  

At this realization, the man’s resolve wavered.  

The golden-robed disciple from the Supreme Infinite Dao Sect had already displayed power that faintly surpassed his own despite his youth.  

And now, it seemed the other one—who hadn’t even acted yet—might be even more terrifying.  

*What rotten luck, running into two Supreme Infinite Dao Sect monsters like this!*  

Just then, his junior sister whispered,  

"Senior Brother, those two from the Supreme Infinite Dao Sect seem to have gotten Immortal Crystals from that strange golden slip. Should we… still compete? If we don’t stay here, we’ll have to go to the outer city."  

His junior brother’s eyes also gleamed with temptation.  

"Forget it. They were here first. Since we’re all disciples of top-tier factions, harmony is paramount. Here’s what we’ll do—the last palace goes to Junior Sister. Junior Brother Ning and I will stay in the outer city."  

The two juniors stared at him in disbelief.  

*Harmony is paramount?*  

Since when did their senior brother speak like this?  

Before they could protest, his stern gaze silenced them.  

---  

"Honored guests, here are your keys. Just channel your divine sense into them to locate your respective palaces."  

The woman handed two jade keys to Zhang Jing, her gaze lingering on the golden talisman—especially the auction house insignia—with undisguised awe.  

Only today had she learned that such an artifact existed—one that could connect to the auction house anytime, anywhere, for transactions.  

*This is the kind of privilege disciples of top-tier factions enjoy?*  

No wonder so many fought tooth and nail to join the seven great sects.  

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing passed one key to Qu Junhou and said lightly,  

"Brother Qu, 3,500 destiny points. Remember to pay me back when we return to the sect."  

"3,500 destiny points?!" Qu Junhou exclaimed.  

"Indeed. Absurdly expensive. A century’s earnings in one go," Zhang Jing replied with a hint of resignation.  

When he’d exchanged for Immortal Crystals using the VIP talisman, he’d been shocked by the conversion rate—100 destiny points to 1 Immortal Crystal.  

At that rate, renting a palace for three and a half months cost 3,500 destiny points!  

For context, even a single grain of Time Sand—imbued with temporal power—rarely exceeded 100 destiny points.  

As they spoke, a man in a jade-green robe emerged from a nearby palace. His features were unremarkable, but his eyes carried an air of arrogance.  

Spotting Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou, he paused.  

"Disciples of our Supreme Infinite Dao Sect? Hah, from the Nine Domains lineage."  

His gaze swept over the jade keys in their hands, then the single key held by the Zhou Tian Star Temple trio.  

A guess formed in his mind.  

In the next instant, he appeared beside the Golden Core woman and asked coolly,  

"Are there only three palaces left?"  

She nodded.  

Understanding, he turned to Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou with a genial smile.  

"Junior Brothers, this senior brother is named Ge Qingshen. Would you do me the honor of relinquishing your palace keys to these two fellow Daoists from the Zhou Tian Star Temple? They are old friends of mine."  

"Rest assured, I’ll compensate you for the Immortal Crystals. What do you say?"
