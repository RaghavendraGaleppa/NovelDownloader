# Chapter 31: Three Thousand Years Ago, the Daoist Ascended; Seventeen Years Ago, Xuji Collided with a God!

"What's going on?"  

Li Zhengjing looked at the blade in his hand, his gaze shifting to the carriage.  

"Shi Xuanhe, an inner sect elder of the Formation Pavilion of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. His true qi has penetrated a hundred acupoints, and his body is inscribed with the Wind Array Runes, allowing him to move like the wind—elusive and unpredictable."  

"But his fame within the True Qi realm isn’t due to his speed. It’s because he excels at self-preservation!"  

"To put it bluntly... among all the elders of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, when it comes to being cowardly, his reputation is unmatched!"  

"If you can't kill him today, I’ll have to step in. Regardless of the outcome, he will die without fail!"  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official chuckled. "For someone so obsessed with preserving his life, why would he willingly act as a sacrificial pawn? The moment he arrived, didn’t he make it clear? You just needed to slash him once, and that would be enough..."  

Li Zhengjing couldn’t help but laugh. "What an interesting man."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official continued, "I already knew that there were no True Qi realm inner sect elders or true disciples near Wanlin County."  

"Two days ago, a member of the Chen Clan in Bailing Prefecture was killed. As a result, all affiliated clan members and retainers in the vicinity were ordered to investigate."  

"Initial investigations suggested the killer was likely within the Internal Qi realm. Since Chen Youyu held a lowly status, the Chen Clan didn’t send any True Qi realm experts to handle the case."  

"The only True Qi realm figure near Qixing Prefecture is Shi Xuanhe, who came with the Formation Pavilion Master."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official spoke slowly. "By sending Shi Xuanhe, the Formation Pavilion Master was signaling to me that this matter ends here!"  

"Sending him to intercept us means they’re no longer intercepting us?" Li Zhengjing asked in surprise.  

"Exactly."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official explained, "The abilities you’ve displayed are beyond their comprehension. To them, your strength is at least at the True Qi realm!"  

"More importantly, since they know I’ve made preparations, they can’t be sure whether I have other hidden methods beyond just you!"  

"Shi Xuanhe has no desire to die, and for now, they lack the manpower to suppress you and force me to act. Without that, they can’t use the Dao Contract to kill me."  

"Without the Dao Contract, the Formation Pavilion Master would have to fight me directly—and my skills surpass his."  

"At this point, he has no choice but to use Shi Xuanhe to convey his surrender."  

"By backing down, he’s also asking for a favor—that I keep his 'secrets' to myself."  

"Moreover, by using your hand to eliminate a group of subordinates under Chen Zhu, the inner sect’s Grand Elder of the Ancient Moon Peak, he’s already gained quite a bit."  

"So the rest of the journey should be relatively safe. But we must still leave the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect’s territory as soon as possible."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official added, "If we delay, they’ll have time to prepare. By then, not just the Formation Pavilion Master—other high-ranking figures from the Ancient Moon Peak might mobilize True Qi realm experts to block our path!"  

"Then let’s hurry."  

Li Zhengjing sheathed his blade and leaped onto the carriage.  

The journey that followed was indeed uneventful.  

Several days passed, yet they were still within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect’s territory.  

But on this day, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official spoke slowly.  

"We part ways here."  

"We’re still at least a thousand miles from the border of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect’s domain," Li Zhengjing replied.  

"I’ll take the remaining road alone," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said calmly. "You can return now, but the carriage stays with me."  

"I never intended to take it," Li Zhengjing said as he dismounted. "If I rode this carriage back, wouldn’t that be an open declaration to the sect’s higher-ups that I was the one escorting you?"  

"You’re clever, with exceptional comprehension and innate talent. It would be a shame if you died from the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official stepped down from the carriage, his clawed feet gripping the ground firmly like an eagle’s talons. He looked at Li Zhengjing and said, "The Sword-Nurturing Art I taught you is only a temporary solution—it treats the symptoms, not the root cause."  

"Once you reach the True Qi realm, your cultivation will grow stronger, and the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi will become even sharper and more lethal."  

"Even with the Sword-Nurturing Art, the 36,500 muscle fibers in your arm won’t be able to withstand the overwhelming sword qi!"  

"I understand," Li Zhengjing nodded.  

"By escorting me this far, you’ve earned a favor from me."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official said, "After leaving the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, I’ll do my best to find a solution for you. If fate allows us to meet again, I’ll resolve this issue for you once and for all!"  

He paused before continuing, "In the meantime, if you have the chance, look into records about the Kunlun Immortal Sect’s Heavenly Azure Daoist."  

"Heavenly Azure Daoist?" Li Zhengjing was momentarily stunned.  

"I know! I know!" The wall-clinging bird immediately interjected. "The Heavenly Azure Daoist of the Kunlun Immortal Sect was the last immortal deity in the world! Legends say that three thousand years ago, he was invincible, ascended to immortality amidst radiant light, and transcended the mortal realm!"  

"Surprisingly, you’ve read a few books."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official spoke slowly. "He is the only person in history who cultivated the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi and met a peaceful end!"  

"Peaceful end?"  

Li Zhengjing was taken aback.  

The wall-clinging bird, oblivious to the implications, continued showing off its knowledge.  

"Rumors say the Heavenly Azure Daoist possessed an extraordinary physique, known as the Innate Immortal Root Divine Body!"  

The bird rambled on, "No matter the injury or curse, he could recover completely in the blink of an eye."  

Li Zhengjing’s gaze sharpened slightly. *Could this be the Eternal Verdant Sacred Body that the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord seeks?*  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official continued, "The Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi is excessively sharp and fierce, thus harming the user. But for the Heavenly Azure Daoist, his injuries healed instantly, so it didn’t affect him."  

"According to ancient texts, after reaching the True Qi realm, it took him only a year to transcend mortality and achieve the Daoist Immortal realm!"  

"Finally, three thousand years ago, he ascended amidst radiant light, joining the ranks of the immortals!"  

At this point, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official’s expression grew slightly complicated.  

The wall-clinging bird didn’t catch the nuance, but Li Zhengjing sensed something amiss.  

"Earlier, you said he met a peaceful end?" Li Zhengjing mused. "Yet the World Salvation Golden Ship was founded 1,300 years ago, claiming there are no immortals beyond the Nine Heavens?"  

"Because 1,300 years ago, the first World Calamity Salvation Celestial Venerable... dug up the Heavenly Azure Daoist’s tomb!" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said slowly.  

"What?"  

Li Zhengjing was stunned, and the wall-clinging bird’s eyes widened in disbelief.  

An immortal who ascended to divinity... buried in the mortal world?  

"Ascension to immortality is nothing more than the exhaustion of lifespan—buried in the dust!"  

"The so-called radiant ascension and joining the ranks of immortals is a lie!"  

"The Heavenly Azure Daoist stood at the pinnacle of the world. He was the limit of cultivation—there was no path beyond, only a return to dust!"  

"The first World Calamity Salvation Celestial Venerable declared this, but few believed him."  

"Yet after the Heavenly Azure Daoist, there truly were no more legends of ascension to immortality!"  

"Some, nearing the end of their lifespans but finding no further path in cultivation, became followers of the World Calamity Salvation Celestial Venerable in their final years!"  

"Thus, emulating ancient legends, they gathered cultivators from across the world to build the World Salvation Golden Ship together."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official sighed and waved a claw. "Enough of this. Leave the carriage here and return."  

Li Zhengjing bowed slightly and prepared to remove his mask.  

"Keep this," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said.  

"Thank you."  

Li Zhengjing sensed the item’s extraordinary nature and didn’t refuse.  

The wall-clinging bird flew out of the carriage and perched on his shoulder.  

Meanwhile, half a tree extended two roots from the soil, stretching out of the clay pot like legs, and scampered over.  

"Until we meet again!"  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official waved, bidding farewell to the man, the bird, and the tree. Then, with a single slap to the horse’s head—  

The dragon’s claw struck with immense force, shattering the horse’s skull into pulp.  

At that moment, he spread his arms, and a pair of golden wings unfurled from his back, resplendent like those of a great roc.  

With a thought, he soared into the sky, vanishing into the clouds.  

Before long, he landed atop a mountain peak.  

A figure slowly approached from below—a man in dark gray robes, a scar like a centipede marring his face. He chanted solemnly:  

"Eternal Great Calamity! All living beings suffer!"  

"The Golden Ship transcends! Crossing to freedom!"  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official responded in kind, then turned his head slowly, golden eyes gleaming.  

"Disciple... you’ve become the current Herald of the World Salvation Golden Ship?"  

"Only because you shattered the Boarding Token and fled seventeen years ago, Master. As punishment, I was demoted to Herald."  

The scar-faced man in gray robes spoke coolly. "After seventeen years of fleeing, replacing every bit of your flesh, bones, and blood... have you managed to erase the mark of the World Salvation Golden Ship?"  

"If I had, I’d be free—no longer bound. Why would I need another Boarding Token to return?" The Ghost Valley Spirit Official grinned savagely.  

"The Celestial Venerable said you would return."  

The scar-faced man sighed. "The mortal world is no place to linger. The World Salvation Golden Ship is the true immortal realm. Immortals may occasionally descend, but they always return in the end..."  

He looked at the Ghost Valley Spirit Official and continued, "The Celestial Venerable ordered me to relay this: If you repent and return to the Golden Ship to heal one person, all will be forgiven... You will remain the First of the Twelve Helmsmen."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official fell silent. "Who?"  

"Xu Ji, Grand Elder of the Kunlun Immortal Sect. Three years ago, the Celestial Venerable personally subdued him..."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official raised an eyebrow. "I recall that seventeen years ago, when Mount Fengdu collapsed and a million demons ran amok, the first to report it to the three great immortal sects was this Xu Ji..."  

He paused. "Rumors say he was assaulted by the million demons and ghosts of Mount Fengdu. Though his profound cultivation saved his life, the encounter left him deranged. He went mad, defected from the Kunlun Immortal Sect, and slaughtered countless."  

"Thus, we ask you to return and cure his madness."  

The scar-faced man’s tone grew solemn. "And one more thing—he didn’t collide with demons. He collided... with a god."
