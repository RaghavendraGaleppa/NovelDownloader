# Chapter 119: Abundant Harvest

At the edge of the great pit, a small group of Outer World Disciples entered. Adorned with Pure Yang Blood Essence, they burst forth with sacred effulgence, resembling falling meteors as they pierced through the dense, colorful mist formed by the Heavenly Radiance.

If they had Pure Yang substances for protection, it wasn't impossible for them to enter. They had simply been unwilling to risk themselves earlier. Otherwise, why would they have brought in External Sages?

Qin Ming held the Near-Immortal Object, looking at the pile of ashes on the ground. "The curtain has been raised. This was always meant to be the stage for Outer World Disciples. Why did you meddle? You wouldn't have died if you hadn't courted death."

After killing He Tai, he turned to face Chen Xingyuan and Li Tianhe.

The two stood on the slope, appearing quite detached, and hadn't entered the pit to help He Tai.

However, both now looked serious. Qin Ming's clean and decisive elimination of the Great Ape King Lineage disciple made them feel pressure.

"Though He Tai wasn't an extraordinary individual, he was still somewhat famous. His death here will certainly cause a stir."

"Due to their unique martial techniques, some members of the Great Ape King Lineage are quite unyielding and prone to violent tempers, and they hold grudges easily," Li Tianhe and Chen Xingyuan spoke consecutively.

Qin Ming nodded. "The Outer World Disciples will be here any moment."

Their words seemed unrelated, but each clearly understood the other's intent.

Chen Xingyuan said, "When the Outer World Disciples appear, we will truthfully report that He Tai went to meet you but was unfortunately burned to death by the Heavenly Radiance on the way."

Qin Ming lightly tapped the Eight Trigrams Furnace, which emitted a crisp metallic chime, like the gentle tolling of a Daoist bell, as if it could sweep away the dust from people's hearts.

He spoke, "Unless you personally handle it, it's hard to understand the wonders of a Near-Immortal Object."

"To be frank, we do want to study it," Li Tianhe admitted.

"Besides 'truthfully reporting,' I also want some Heavenly Radiance techniques," Qin Ming stated.

"Your appetite is quite large."

"Given our identities, once we help you conceal the truth, we certainly won't be able to change our story later. Isn't that enough?" Both spoke one after another, slightly frowning.

Qin Ming remained calm. "You are too petty. You want to study a Near-Immortal Object without paying anything? Is there such a cheap deal? You don't have much time now."

Originally, the three might have had a bloody battle, but it had temporarily turned into a "transaction," with He Tai likely being the only casualty. Qin Ming actually wanted to give these two a good beating, but the time and place were wrong. If he accidentally killed another, the repercussions would be immense.

"Alright, I have a Heavenly Radiance technique here," Chen Xingyuan nodded.

Li Tianhe also followed suit, willing to offer a cultivation method. Both valued the Near-Immortal Object highly, presumably because their orthodoxies contained relevant records.

Qin Ming approached them to "negotiate," unafraid that both would simultaneously attack. They both knew that neither possessed the ability to instantly kill the other.

"I have a 'Iron Leg Art' here..." Chen Xingyuan began.

Qin Ming immediately wanted to kick him. What kind of trash technique was that? He directly interrupted, "Your Five Elements Palace is a massive establishment with many extraordinary techniques, right? Just give me any one with a Five Element attribute. I don't need anything of a higher level."

Chen Xingyuan's expression stiffened. The other party's demand was ridiculously high. He himself was still in the stage of practicing extraordinary techniques. How could he possibly trade such a vigor technique to an outsider? If he dared to leak it, the elders of the Five Elements Palace would flay him alive.

"Then 'Dark Earth Fist'!" Chen Xingyuan said, as if making a great sacrifice.

"I have the Wuji Scripture. Do I look like I'd care for your kind of fist technique? The Five Elements Palace is nothing special," Qin Ming shook his head.

Chen Xingyuan frowned deeply, looking at the approaching Outer World Disciples. Finally, he sighed. "Then, 'Wind-Fire Vigor' it is."

"How exactly does it work?" Qin Ming asked.

"Wind fuels fire, and fire wields wind's might," Chen Xingyuan explained. "This is not only an offensive Heavenly Radiance technique but also a very formidable movement art."

Qin Ming immediately nodded. "Perform it seriously and recite it aloud. I'll learn as you do."

Li Tianhe was very self-aware, retreating to a sufficiently far distance.

A moment later, Chen Xingyuan's expression was complex. He had only demonstrated it once, yet the other party had already nodded. Was he feigning understanding, or was his talent truly exceptional? He dispelled distracting thoughts, holding the Near-Immortal Object, standing to the side and sensing it intently. Alas, apart from making his mind clear when tapping the furnace body, he discovered nothing else.

On the other side, Qin Ming and Li Tianhe also completed their exchange, with Qin Ming learning the Jade Splendor Vigor from him. Practicing this Heavenly Radiance technique could nourish the body and heal injuries. If one cultivated Jade Splendor Vigor when exhausted, it could even accelerate recovery. According to Li Tianhe, cultivating Jade Splendor Vigor once a day was like consuming jade liquid, equivalent to drinking a bowl of tonic, providing significant benefits to the physical body. This claim was certainly exaggerated, but long-term practice would indeed yield marvels.

"Alas, if you were alive, I reckon I could've gotten another Heavenly Radiance technique," Qin Ming remarked with regret, looking at the ashes left by He Tai.

The Outer World Disciples had arrived but didn't approach. Even with Pure Yang Blood Essence, they were extremely wary of the bottom of the great pit where the Heavenly Radiance was most concentrated. They had already seen Chen Xingyuan and Li Tianhe studying the Eight Trigrams Furnace in succession, which was normal; no one would be uninterested in such an artifact. The Outer World Disciples didn't stop them, as it was the latter who had risked their lives to retrieve it.

Tang Xumi, Jiang Shengyu, and others hadn't come personally, sending their most trusted individuals, as well as Outer World Disciples with their own intentions.

"Everyone, we have paid a heavy price and finally retrieved the Near-Immortal Object. It's a pity about Senior Brother He Tai, who was burned to ashes by the Heavenly Radiance. Heaven envies talent."

Chen Xingyuan spoke, fulfilling his promise. Even when speaking of such a "sorrowful" matter, he maintained an indifferent demeanor. Qin Ming realized that this young man, whatever he was taught, always tried to maintain a state of apathy, devoid of joy or sorrow.

Li Tianhe, seeing what he was thinking, said, "He's practicing the 'Sutra of Withering and Flourishing,' and is currently in the 'withering' stage."

"Such terrible news! Senior Brother He Tai, with his heaven-blessed talent, actually ascended here. What a pity, we've lost a future Grandmaster." Outer World Disciples spoke one after another, uttering platitudes. But... they were too perfunctory. Their gazes never left the Near-Immortal Object. Some even failed to hide their excitement, a smile playing on their lips, even as they "mourned" He Tai.

After Chen Xingyuan and Li Tianhe finished studying the Eight Trigrams Furnace, they didn't stir up trouble, "truthfully" stating He Tai's cause of death, and returning the furnace to Qin Ming.

"Senior Brothers, to retrieve the Near-Immortal Object, He Tai ascended to immortality, and I, too, am heavily wounded..." Qin Ming began.

"Junior Brother, I have spirit medicine here, for you..." An Outer World Disciple immediately responded with enthusiasm, tossing over a jade jar.

Qin Ming sighed, "My friend who invited me to help, after being heavily wounded, left early. I don't know who to give this Near-Immortal Object to now."

"Junior Brother, give it to me. It's a hot potato. Keeping it with you will easily attract disaster."

"Senior Brother, what do you seek? This Junior Sister will help you solve your worries. The Near-Immortal Object is useless to you. Once you step out of the dense Heavenly Radiance area, you will easily be targeted."

In an instant, all the Outer World Disciples used secret arts to secretly transmit messages to Qin Ming.

He responded, "Senior Brothers and Sisters, this was originally the Sect-guarding Treasure of the Outer World. It has nothing to do with me, so I must naturally return it with both hands." He paused slightly. "A Senior Brother said that since I was heavily wounded for the Near-Immortal Object, he wanted to compensate me with a secret manual. So... I thank him."

Who said that? The Outer World Disciples looked at each other.

"Junior Brother, I unexpectedly obtained a cultivation method for the Path of Rebirth, called 'Gold-Cutting Finger.' It's for you." Someone spoke first, regardless of whether anyone had actually said that. Since no one had spoken up yet, he might as well be the one to offer it.

"Senior Brother, I have 'Dragon Claw Vigor' here. Once mastered, your five fingers will be indestructible!" Another person spoke.

Then, more people started announcing cultivation methods.

Chen Xingyuan and Li Tianhe looked at Qin Ming, not expecting the fake successor of the Six Imperial Lineages to be so skilled at "demanding techniques"!

"Senior Brother, I have a copy of the 'Golden Crow Illumination-Night Scripture' here. It might even be rarer than an extraordinary technique," a female Outer World Disciple said.

"If you have that scripture, the Near-Immortal Object is yours then," Qin Ming immediately responded with enthusiasm, no longer hiding his intentions, preparing to trade on the spot.

The young girl, sixteen or seventeen years old, with her black hair cascading down to her waist, walked gracefully, smiling gently. "Senior Brother..."

When she saw Qin Ming leave the bottom of the great pit and was still a dozen meters away from her, she suddenly attacked. Divine radiance blossomed in her Yellow Court, sweeping towards the figure in front of her.

Qin Ming had known all along that she was deceiving him, but he still walked out, primarily wanting to verify with the Outer World Disciples whether they could activate the Eight Trigrams Furnace. He streaked like lightning, quickly evading, activating wind vigor, swirling the Heavenly Radiance, and charged forward with a booming sound.

The girl's entire body was covered in luminous rain, swirling around her, as if transforming into countless flying blades, shooting towards the young man in front. Qin Ming had practiced multiple defensive cultivation methods, such as Golden Silkworm Art, Golden Light Shield, and Golden Armor Art, all operating in a fused, unified form. Furthermore, the Fire Leaving Scripture and Wuji Scripture also contained powerful defensive techniques, which he activated with the fused and unified Heavenly Radiance Vigor.

In an instant, his body was covered with golden patterns, emanating earth essence and faint fiery light. The Outer World Disciple's luminous rain fell, like ice and snow encountering scorching sun, dissipating into streams of light with sizzling sounds.

Qin Ming had already rushed close to her. When his fist light appeared, the girl shrieked in fright. She had personally witnessed the miserable state of Zheng Maoze when he was attacked at close range. With a thud, she was yanked up. Qin Ming didn't hit her but grabbed her by the neck, dragging her to the edge of the great pit.

"Senior Brother, it's a misunderstanding! I meant no harm, I was just too eager," the girl's voice trembled, because the Heavenly Radiance Vigor flowing on his palm was like divine flames in a furnace, scorching her and making her face lose color. She dared not release her spiritual consciousness, fearing that the Heavenly Radiance Vigor on his body would ignite and burn through it. What a terrifying young man! The Heavenly Radiance Vigor he cultivated was too frightening.

"Can you activate the Near-Immortal Object?" Qin Ming asked in a deep voice, then commanded, "Speak quickly!"

The girl was intimidated and startled, stuttering, "How can we control such a mighty artifact? Unless it's nurtured for many years to restore its sentience and gain its recognition."

Qin Ming captured her emotional fluctuations, quickly resonating with them, and confirmed that what she said was true! This put his mind at ease; even if he threw it away, he wouldn't make the mistake of aiding the enemy.

Qin Ming didn't make things difficult for her. He released her fair neck. "Go fetch the 'Golden Crow Illumination-Night Scripture,' and the Near-Immortal Object will be yours."

The girl immediately ran off, like a startled white rabbit, muttering curses in her heart. If she had the Golden Crow Illumination-Night Scripture, would she still need to trick him for the Near-Immortal Object?

"I kindly helped you all retrieve this mighty artifact, and I'm heavily wounded as a result. Yet, I was deceived and attacked. It truly disheartens me," Qin Ming sighed.

With a clang, he threw the Eight Trigrams Furnace into the bottom of the great pit where the Heavenly Radiance was concentrated.

"Brother, no!"

"Junior Brother, don't! We didn't trick you."

A group of Outer World Disciples shouted, some getting agitated.

Chen Xingyuan and Li Tianhe exchanged glances. They were tempted to go pick it up and study it again, but upon seeing Qin Ming's gaze, they all retreated. They knew that cutting off someone's path to wealth was like killing their parents, which would forge a mortal enmity.

"Junior Brother, wait a moment!" Finally, a few Outer World Disciples rushed to the surface, briefly communicated, and actually brought back three secret manuals. They couldn't possibly carry these themselves; these were rewards obtained by certain External Sages, borrowed by these few.

Qin Ming flipped through them, and indeed, there were 'Gold-Cutting Finger' and 'Dragon Claw Vigor'. Additionally, there was a copy of 'Three Mountains Seal', which required hand seals to cast, and its power seemed very formidable! He was very satisfied; these were all unexpected gains.

Qin Ming didn't hesitate. He picked up the Near-Immortal Object from the Heavenly Radiance-dense pit bottom and tossed it towards the slope. Clearly, these Outer World Disciples had already negotiated. There was no fighting; they planned to "discuss" its ownership once they returned to the surface. In this place dense with Heavenly Radiance, they felt uneasy. Moreover, this small group of them were almost all representatives of core disciples, so there was no need to fight to the death here.

"By the way, Tang Xumi, Jiang Shengyu, and the others promised me that they would give me a top-tier cultivation method after we leave. Tell them not to forget!" Qin Ming shouted from behind.

At this moment, who cared about him? With the Near-Immortal Object in hand, these Outer World Disciples quickly rushed upwards.

An unexpected event occurred. A figure with flowing robes appeared, holding a luminous bamboo staff, blocking their path on the slope. It was Li Qingxu, who had personally entered the fray.

"Senior Brother Tang..."

"Senior Brother Hu Tingwen!"

The Outer World Disciples immediately shouted, calling for assistance. Li Qingxu was as fast as lightning. The purplish-glowing bamboo staff he held had endured the Otherworldly Celestial Light without being completely destroyed, having been refined into a treasure by his master, allowing it to briefly break through the Heavenly Radiance.

With a bang, Li Qingxu's staff struck, sending an Outer World Disciple flying over ten meters away. He couldn't block Li Qingxu at all. "Hand it over!" he said coldly, turning into a bolt of lightning and charging forward, preparing to intercept the Near-Immortal Object.

Below the slope, Qin Ming took out his great bow, nocked the special blue jade-iron arrow onto the string, infused it with a massive amount of Heavenly Radiance, and then shot it out.

*Pfft!*

Li Qingxu's palm was stained with blood, the blue arrow having cut through his flesh, tearing a deep gash. His movements instantly stalled, and two cold bolts of electricity shot from his eyes. Qin Ming thought to himself, Li Qingxu, as a core disciple, was indeed excessively strong, far beyond what other disciples could compare to. The special arrow hadn't struck his body, nor had it pierced his palm.

"Junior Brother, you keep it for now!" The disciple holding the Near-Immortal Object clanged, throwing the Near-Immortal Object back, discarding it near Qin Ming.

Li Qingxu was furious. He rushed over and struck this person with his staff, sending him flying over twenty meters away, breaking his bones and severely injuring him.

"Li Qingxu, you're injured and still won't give up, not leaving!" Tang Xumi, Jiang Shengyu, Hu Tingwen, and others appeared, entering the great pit together.

At this moment, all the disciples at the edge of the great pit appeared. They knew that the ownership of the Near-Immortal Object was about to be decided. Qin Ming saw some familiar faces. His heart stirred, and he exerted force, throwing the Eight Trigrams Furnace towards Zheng Maoze.

The sacred object, radiating auspicious glow and emanating immortal light, crashed with a clang before Zheng Maoze's eyes. His pupils contracted. Was this a blessing or a curse?!
