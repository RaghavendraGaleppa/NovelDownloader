# Chapter 26: Sparring

Han Yue escorted Xiao Liu back to his secluded cultivation chamber before returning to his own quarters to rest.

This deer lung would allow Xiao Liu to attempt qi absorption over a hundred times, significantly increasing his chances of a successful breakthrough!

Such was the wondrous cycle of the Heavenly Dao. While Han Yue diligently pursued his own path to enlightenment, he had simultaneously become the very opportunity Xiao Liu needed.

Returning to his room, Han Yue began another round of cultivation.

Within his dantian, thunderous mana circulated. The 365 Thunder Nurturing Runes seemed to breathe in rhythm with Han Yue's heartbeat, expanding and contracting.

Primordial qi surged forth from the [Heavenly Origin Treasure Lotus], generating vast amounts of mana through the runes' respiration that filled every corner of Han Yue's body.

Before long, Han Yue successfully condensed another Thunder Nurturing Rune.

His total rune count had now reached a full cycle plus 157 additional runes.

Han Yue's mana capacity continued to expand!

Meanwhile, his physical body grew harder than refined steel through daily reinforcement.

As his cultivation session ended, Han Yue stepped outside. Since beginning his hunts for second-order demonic beasts, his mana consumption had increased dramatically, requiring longer intervals between expeditions.

This granted him more time to remain at the Meat Distribution Compound.

He made his way to the training grounds of Courtyard Nine, where Fang Yi practiced as usual.

Han Yue considered himself exceptionally diligent—every day was packed with either mana accumulation or hunting expeditions.

Yet Fang Yi matched his dedication effortlessly.

From what Han Yue observed, Fang Yi devoted most of her time to cultivation.

Spotting Han Yue, Fang Yi called out:

"Han Yue, I heard you've started hunting second-order demonic beasts. Let's spar—I want to see what second-order strength looks like!"

Han Yue had no objections.

"Compound Leader, you'd better be careful then!"

They took their positions in the training grounds. Han Yue picked up a steel blade from the side and waited for Fang Yi to make the first move.

Without ceremony, once Han Yue was ready, Fang Yi charged at him wielding a massive steel hammer!

The hammer's shaft stretched over two meters long, its head a full meter wide—a solid steel construction weighing thousands of jin.

Yet in Fang Yi's hands, it seemed weightless!

The hammer tore through the air with a thunderous roar, leaving afterimages as it smashed into the ground where Han Yue had stood, creating a massive crater.

But Han Yue was already gone.

Just before impact, Han Yue had transformed into light and vanished.

Like a shadow, he now clung to Fang Yi's back, his steel blade slicing toward her neck as her momentum waned.

As the blade was about to connect, Fang Yi twisted her body with uncanny prescience and dodged.

Han Yue raised an eyebrow but remained composed. He shifted positions mid-air effortlessly—no matter how Fang Yi evaded, Han Yue always reappeared behind her.

The blade never left Fang Yi's neck!

After several dodges, Fang Yi finally exhausted her momentum, and Han Yue's blade caught up.

Abandoning evasion, she reached bare-handed for the blade itself, attempting to disarm Han Yue.

But he flashed away again! Seizing the moment when Fang Yi's strength ebbed, his blade struck her back!

They separated—this round went to Han Yue.

He'd used the flat of the blade, leaving no mark on Fang Yi.

"Han Yue, you're incredible! I couldn't even touch you!" Fang Yi exclaimed.

In close combat, such instantaneous movement seemed downright unfair.

"The Compound Leader is impressive too. Your combat awareness surpasses mine—I didn't expect you to dodge so many attacks!"

Fang Yi possessed extraordinary battle instincts, her evasions almost allowing her to escape Han Yue's teleportation-assisted assaults.

"Again!" Fang Yi, unsatisfied, immediately dragged Han Yue back into sparring.

Han Yue obliged wholeheartedly.

Their session lasted a full hour before concluding.

Both were thoroughly satisfied—a perfect diversion from their grueling cultivation routines.

Thus, Han Yue's daily routine expanded: beyond cultivation and hunting, he now regularly sparred with Fang Yi.

As days passed, hunting second-order demonic beasts became routine for Han Yue. The interval between hunts shortened from ten days to seven, his efficiency steadily improving!

His wealth accumulated rapidly.

His range of activity in the outer territories expanded dramatically.

Three months flashed by.

Meanwhile, in the secluded chamber, Xiao Liu reached the critical moment of his breakthrough.

He'd consumed a third of the massive deer lung.

Xiao Liu's physique had transformed beyond recognition.

His formerly scrawny frame had grown ten centimeters taller, muscles now evenly developed.

Countless cycles of the deer meat's spiritual energy had circulated and dissipated within his body.

Channeling mana had become second nature to Xiao Liu.

His body absorbed increasing amounts of bloodline primordial qi. Though much of it dissipated, it continuously strengthened his physique.

One day, after consuming another large chunk of deer lung, Xiao Liu entered digestion mode.

As usual, primordial qi from the deer meat circulated through his body before gradually dispersing.

But this time was different.

During the circulation, a faint wisp of mana emerged from Xiao Liu's own body!

This strand of mana joined the circulation but, unexpectedly, didn't dissipate.

As time passed, the foreign qi from the deer meat gradually faded, while Xiao Liu's self-generated mana grew increasingly concentrated.

Finally, all alien qi dissipated, leaving only Xiao Liu's innate bloodline mana!

This mana shared properties with the elk's—reaching second-order potency from its inception!

Circulating through his meridians, the mana finally took root in Xiao Liu's dantian, forming a tiny seed.

Xiao Liu had successfully retained his first strand of mana, forming his mana seed!

He had broken through!

Xiao Liu emerged from seclusion, unable to contain his excitement as he burst outside.

Running wildly, he shouted:

"I did it!"

"I've achieved Physical Refinement!"

"I'm a cultivator now!"

Rushing to the training grounds, Xiao Liu hugged Fang Yi mid-exercise, trembling with emotion.

Having witnessed Xiao Liu's struggles over the years, Fang Yi gently patted his head.

Inside his room, Han Yue heard Xiao Liu's triumphant cries and smiled knowingly.

His hand touched the corpse storage bag at his waist—filled with complete sets of hearts, livers, spleens, lungs, and kidneys from second-order demonic beasts.

These long-prepared materials would no longer be needed.
