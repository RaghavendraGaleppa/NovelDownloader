# Chapter 97: The Little Ladybug  

The area closest to the Flaming Mountain was now almost entirely under Wu Bing's control, with the nests of the Gold-Devouring Bees firmly in his grasp.  

Having mastered twenty-three second-tier demon beasts and several thousand first-tier ones, Wu Bing had effectively become a dominant force in the Golden Blade Gorge.  

However, his cultivation of the Pure Yang Mantra of the Dao Heart had reached a bottleneck. Even if he implanted more parasitic hosts, the enhancement to his divine sense had become negligible. He needed to strengthen his physical body further to accommodate greater spiritual power.  

When Han returned, Wu Bing spoke up:  

"Master, within a radius of ten thousand miles, I can't find any new Gold-Devouring Bee nests anymore. I've rounded up all the wild ones—it's nearly impossible to find more now. The only options left are to search deeper into the core regions of the Golden Blade Gorge or head toward the Gold-Devouring City. But both are tricky. The heart of the gorge is filled with Thunderous Hells—far too dangerous! And if I raid the Gold-Devouring City's apiaries, my elder brother definitely won't allow it. Though... if you're willing to take the blame for me, I might dare to give it a shot!"  

Wu Bing's scheming was practically audible.  

Han curled his lip and said, "You should know when to stop. Your divine sense has already hit its limit—planting more parasites won't help. You'd be better off refining your bloodline and digesting the metals you've consumed. Besides, these bees are too conspicuous, eat too much, and you can't even keep them by your side—they have to stay in their nests to produce honey. But with so much Gold-Devouring Honey flooding the market in Iron-Eater City, prices would crash by at least half if you tried to sell it all now. What's the point of hoarding more bees if the honey won't fetch a good price? It's better to let these twenty-three nests accumulate slowly and sell the honey steadily—that's the most profitable approach."  

Though Wu Bing knew Han was right, the past year of scouting and implanting parasites had been too thrilling to give up.  

Han didn't indulge him. With a flick of his finger, he summoned a bolt of lightning that struck Wu Bing squarely on the forehead, leaving the bear trembling and its fur standing on end.  

"Have you forgotten your elder brother's warnings? Guard against laziness and greed—you must practice restraint at all times! Since I no longer need your protection, you might as well return to Iron-Eater City and stay there for a while."  

From any angle, Wu Bing couldn't defy Han's orders. Crestfallen, the bear turned and trudged back toward the city.  

---  

Han, however, had no intention of returning.  

Ever since his comprehension of thunderforce had reached a new level—one where he no longer injured himself so easily—the intervals between his Thunder Summoning sessions had shortened significantly. After a brief rest, he prepared to begin another round of cultivation.  

Having achieved the fifth Great Perfection, the refinement of his Thunder Nourishing Runes had entered its most challenging phase.  

At this point, the runes had already saturated the flow of his spiritual energy. Whether in his dantian, meridians, or even his sea of consciousness, the runes were densely packed, interlocking seamlessly with no gaps left.  

Every additional rune he refined now had to be forcibly inserted into this tightly woven structure. With each new rune, the space inside his body grew more cramped, and the difficulty of refinement doubled.  

When runes became too densely packed, repulsive forces emerged between them, pushing against one another. Only through exceptional control of spiritual energy, a robust physical foundation, and immense external pressure could success be possible.  

This was why, in the hundreds of thousands of years of Divine Thunder Palace's history, very few had ever surpassed the fifth Great Perfection. Only the most outstanding and fortunate cultivators of each generation could achieve such a feat.  

Yet Han remained confident in his own cultivation. He hadn't even fully tapped into the potential of his Thunder Summoning technique.  

If he ventured deeper into the heart of the Golden Blade Gorge, he was certain he could summon lightning powerful enough to kill him.  

The heavens always accommodated those who sought death.  

Only when he truly reached his limits—or when the opportunity for Core Formation was within reach—would he consider advancing.  

Han's unwavering resolve was subtly influenced by the Blessing Dao Seed within him. With fortune on his side, he instinctively gravitated toward the most beneficial path.  

After resting briefly, Han summoned his flying light and headed toward the core of the Golden Blade Gorge.  

The farther he traveled from the Heavenly River, the fewer signs of life he encountered—only an endless expanse of blackened plains.  

As he traversed this desolate wilderness alone, he felt his mind expanding.  

Unlike the outer regions, teeming with demonic beasts and vibrant life, the Lutian Wasteland had only one theme: the struggle between man and nature.  

---  

Meanwhile, on the other side of the Golden Blade Gorge, near Iron-Eater City, inside a Gold-Devouring Bee nest...  

A ladybug the size of a sesame seed flitted from one honeycomb chamber to another.  

Compared to the massive bees, the crystalline little insect was as inconspicuous as a speck of dust.  

Moreover, it possessed an incredibly potent concealment ability—despite its erratic flight, the Gold-Devouring Bees remained oblivious to its presence.  

The ladybug moved swiftly, soon exploring the entire nest.  

But it seemed unsatisfied with its findings and silently flew out.  

Once beyond the bees' sight, it abruptly transformed into a young woman.  

She wore an intricately embroidered, multicolored robe, with silver bangles adorning both arms. Her delicate features carried a wild, archaic beauty.  

Yet at this moment, displeasure flickered in her eyes, her brows slightly furrowed.  

"These sect records are completely unreliable!" she muttered.  

"I traveled all this way just for the Poison-Warding Divine Art, but after searching three Gold-Devouring Bee nests, I haven't found a single drop of honey!"  

"I'm running low on Tracking Bugs—I can only check one more nest at most. If I still don't find any honey, I'll have to think of another plan!"  

The thought only deepened her frustration.  

Little did she know, she was merely a year too late.  

The honey from all the nests in this region had already been claimed by someone else.  

The three nests she had inspected had all been implanted with Wu Bing's Pure Yang Mantra of the Dao Heart—their honey long since harvested.  

With a wave of her hand, she summoned a swarm of tiny insects that dispersed in all directions across the gorge.  

Unlike Wu Bing's extraordinary sense of smell, she could only rely on these Tracking Bugs to search the vast land for nests.  

But this method was far less efficient and accurate than Wu Bing's, leaving her to rely on sheer luck.  

Transforming back into the crystalline ladybug, she chose a direction and flew off.
