# Chapter 61: Transformation  

After carefully tidying his appearance to appear less haggard, Yao Shifeng stepped out of his room and noticed a box on the living room table.  

Beside the box lay a note. The box, naturally, contained the investments from Gu Mo and the others, while the note was left by the talisman peak's attendant who had delivered it, explaining its origin.  

"Heh."  

Yao Shifeng set the note aside. In the past, receiving investments from Gu Mo and his group would have filled him with joy. But now, his mindset had undergone a drastic change.  

The old Yao Shifeng had believed that with the help of Gu Mo and the small circle within the talisman peak, he could rise step by step. But reality had shown him that such petty endeavors were nothing more than a joke—a single accident could shatter everything.  

Leaving the note behind, Yao Shifeng didn’t even glance at the box before departing the talisman peak, heading straight for the main peak of the Qinglu Sect.  

At this moment, the only person Yao Shifeng could think of who might extend his path of cultivation was He Shaogang, the sect master’s personal disciple who had once extended an invitation to him.  

Faced with the reality of his shattered meridians, Yao Shifeng’s pride had completely crumbled. Now, he intended to plead with Senior Brother He, hoping for his assistance.  

Of course, Yao Shifeng was prepared for rejection. After all, he had previously turned down He Shaogang’s invitation. Returning now with his tail between his legs made rejection highly likely. But for the sake of his future, Yao Shifeng had no choice but to try.  

However, as a mere attendant disciple, he couldn’t enter the main peak directly. He could only wait outside, hoping to catch He Shaogang passing by.  

Yao Shifeng’s presence soon drew the attention of some inner disciples coming and going from the main peak. Most merely glanced at him before disregarding him—an attendant disciple was hardly worth their notice.  

But when someone recognized Yao Shifeng as the attendant disciple who had once received an invitation from He Shaogang, the sect master’s personal disciple, the attention on him grew significantly.  

He Shaogang was currently the most prominent figure among the inner disciples. Anything related to him naturally attracted widespread interest.  

"Sooner than I expected."  

When He Shaogang received the news, a faint smile curled his lips. He had known Yao Shifeng would come to him eventually—his spiritual roots and status could never contain his ambitions.  

And it was precisely Yao Shifeng’s ambition that He Shaogang valued most. Ambition was good. He liked ambitious people.  

However, He Shaogang had no intention of meeting Yao Shifeng immediately. Since the latter had arrogantly rejected his invitation before, now He Shaogang would make him pay the price for that refusal.  

---  

Time passed, and Yao Shifeng remained standing outside the main peak, silent and still. Already injured, his body now swayed unsteadily.  

But Yao Shifeng gritted his teeth and endured. This was his only hope.  

Just as he felt he was reaching his limit, the person he had been waiting for finally appeared.  

"I heard you wanted to see me?" He Shaogang’s emotionless voice rang out.  

To Yao Shifeng, however, those words sounded like divine music. Without hesitation, he dropped to his knees. "Young Master, I beg for your help."  

This act of kneeling signified Yao Shifeng’s complete abandonment of his former pride and principles. After all, even an attendant disciple would only address an inner disciple as "senior brother" or "senior sister," never resorting to such a humbling gesture.  

"Come find me once your injuries are healed."  

He Shaogang glanced at Yao Shifeng, immediately assessing his condition. With that, he tossed out a jade vial and an identity token before turning and leaving without another word.  

"Thank you for your generosity, Young Master!"  

Staring at the jade vial and identity token before him, Yao Shifeng’s eyes reddened slightly. His path of immortality had been restored—though at the cost of his freedom and pride, he had gained a future.  

---  

"Huh? Who sent me this message talisman?"  

Gu Mo, who had been tinkering in the spirit fields, noticed a message talisman outside the formation. Puzzled, he picked it up and channeled spiritual energy into it, revealing its contents.  

"Has Boss Yao come out of seclusion?"  

Seeing the message, Gu Mo’s face registered surprise. Several months had passed since their last gathering, and he hadn’t expected Yao Shifeng to contact them now.  

But since Yao Shifeng had summoned them at this time, there must be important news. Without hesitation, Gu Mo prepared himself and headed for the market.  

Arriving at the familiar meeting spot, he found Wu Jinfei, Hu Hai, and Chu Feifei already there. The four exchanged bewildered glances.  

"Do you think Boss Yao has broken through to the third level of Qi Refining?" Wu Jinfei ventured. He couldn’t think of any other reason Yao Shifeng would summon them with a message talisman.  

Gu Mo was skeptical. Breaking through to the third level of Qi Refining seemed too fast—far beyond the speed an attendant disciple should possess.  

As they speculated about the reason for the gathering, Yao Shifeng appeared, dressed in plain black robes. His attire immediately drew puzzled looks from the group.  

Gu Mo and the others were all wearing the standard gray robes of attendant disciples. Wearing the appropriate disciple attire within the sect was an unwritten rule. Though this market lay outside the sect’s boundaries—where attire wasn’t restricted—no one usually bothered to change clothes.  

After all, the identity of a Qinglu Sect disciple still carried weight in the market.  

"Why are you all standing here? The place I booked isn’t this one." Yao Shifeng beckoned to them before leaving the private room.  

The group followed.  

Soon, Yao Shifeng led them to the location of their first meeting—the largest restaurant in the market. Gu Mo and the others had seen that this was the designated gathering spot, but they had ignored it, knowing full well they couldn’t afford such a place now.  

"Boss Yao… are we really going in here?"  

Standing at the restaurant’s entrance, Hu Hai asked nervously. He didn’t want to be thrown out later.  

"Of course. I’ve already reserved a banquet." With that, Yao Shifeng strode inside, forcing the others to follow.  

"Boss Yao, how much spirit stone did this cost?"  

Wu Jinfei stared at the opulent private room and the lavish spirit dishes on the table, swallowing hard. Without exaggeration, this single meal could equal several months’ worth of his cultivation resources.  

"Not much. Eat your fill—it’s my treat." Yao Shifeng waved dismissively.  

Despite his words, the group hesitated. They had all come from the attendant disciple quarters with Yao Shifeng and knew his financial situation. Under normal circumstances, he couldn’t possibly afford this.  

Seeing their hesitation, Yao Shifeng called over the restaurant owner. After confirming that Yao Shifeng had already paid, the group stared at him in disbelief.  

"Something big must be happening." Gu Mo studied Yao Shifeng closely. He could tell Yao Shifeng hadn’t reached the third level of Qi Refining. Since his cultivation hadn’t advanced, this sudden lavish banquet could only mean one thing—Yao Shifeng had something major to announce.
