# Chapter 64: The Power of Blood Evil  

As He Changkong's voice faded—  

Whoosh!  

Countless black needle shadows burst from his skull, coalescing into a single black needle that hovered midair, pulsing with dark radiance, extending and retracting unpredictably.  

Bang!  

The sound of a skull exploding followed.  

Wang Chan had expected that detestable grinning face to burst into a mist of blood, but instead, after the explosion, a crimson glow emerged.  

His gaze sharpened.  

The blood light hummed and twisted into various shapes before finally reforming into a head—once again, He Changkong's visage.  

Unlike the previous sinister grin, He Changkong now wore a tight-lipped, grim expression. His hooked nose flared, his face contorted unnaturally, and the eerie blood-red aura radiating from his body sent chills down the spine.  

"N-no… impossible! I clearly used that power to sever the mark you planted in me! How did you find me?"  

The sight of He Changkong in this state seemed to awaken a deep terror in Su Jue. She scrambled backward on all fours until her back hit the cave wall, trembling like a leaf as she let out a ghostly shriek.  

"You can't escape my grasp," He Changkong said to Su Jue before fixing his murky, blood-red eyes on the black needle hovering in the air. Sensing its chilling Yin energy, he tilted his head and stared at Wang Chan with a bone-chilling expression, enunciating each word:  

"Profound Yin energy?"  

"Blood Evil power…" Wang Chan suppressed the urge to activate the other hidden black needle nearby. With his hands clasped behind his back, he said coldly, "A demonic cultivator?"  

His explosive needle technique had never failed him—until now.  

The blood-light transformation was clearly a mid-grade spell, and an extraordinary one at that.  

This contradicted the information provided by the bearded man.  

Combined with Su Jue's earlier words and her current terror, it was evident that He Changkong was far stronger than anticipated.  

At the very least, he was hiding another ability—whether low-grade or mid-grade was uncertain, but the possibility of it being high-grade couldn't be ruled out.  

As he spoke, a strand of Wang Chan's divine sense linked with the [Water-Fire Escape Art], while his concealed hands worked swiftly.  

A mid-grade Earthwalk Talisman lay ready in his sleeve, and a stack of mid-grade offensive talismans—Golden Armor, Earth Prison, and others—could be activated at any moment.  

"Heh, Fellow Daoist Wang is quite the hidden master. Anyone who mistakes you for a mere wandering physician would be crushed to dust," He Changkong said with a hollow laugh, though his expression grew more serious. His eyes darted around warily.  

Wang Chan's strength had exceeded his expectations.  

That black needle, coupled with the two layers of mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans—renowned for their defensive prowess—would take considerable effort to breach.  

He couldn't afford to be careless.  

Suddenly, his gaze froze on the tattered apricot-yellow Daoist robe strewn across the jade bed.  

His face twitched, and his eyes narrowed. Upon closer inspection, he noticed the bed was drenched in liquid.  

Then, he stood dumbstruck.  

Strike while the enemy is vulnerable.  

Seizing the moment, the hovering black needle and the hidden one transformed into white needles crackling with lightning arcs. With two sharp whistles, they shot toward He Changkong.  

Against Blood Evil power, the righteous force of thunder and wood was most effective.  

Clang!  

Thud!  

A crimson armor projection materialized over He Changkong's body—a mid-grade defensive artifact that barely withstood the two strikes before shattering.  

Hum!  

In desperation, He Changkong slapped a silver talisman onto his chest, summoning a translucent silver bell that encased him.  

Strange runes slithered across its surface like tadpoles.  

A mid-grade Silver Bell Talisman—a rare defensive treasure on par with the Golden Armor Talisman.  

Seeing Wang Chan's black needles morph into white ones, infused with the pure Yang energy of thunder—a perfect counter to his Blood Arts—He Changkong had no choice but to deploy two more mid-grade defensive talismans, erecting three layers of protection.  

Only then did his expression shift through a mix of anxiety, fear, rage, and suspicion. Slowly rolling up his left sleeve, he chanted under his breath until a green dot of light appeared on his wrist.  

In the warm glow of the cave, that emerald speck was jarringly out of place.  

"Ah!"  

He Changkong howled in frenzy, his mana surging violently as blood-red energy erupted from his body, sending him into a berserk state bordering on Qi deviation.  

This should have been the perfect opportunity to strike.  

But with He Changkong shielded by multiple defenses and Wang Chan lacking the mana reserves for a prolonged assault or a decisive blow, he could only wait and observe.  

Still, if his opponent truly succumbed to Qi deviation… that would be interesting.  

As a fellow demonic cultivator, Wang Chan knew their Qi deviations were far more catastrophic than those of orthodox practitioners. Once the demonic thoughts and corrupted mana turned inward, the backlash would leave no corpse to bury.  

Yet just then, He Changkong fumbled out a purple talisman from his storage pouch. After a brief hesitation, he slapped it onto his forehead.  

A violet glow shimmered, accompanied by faint Buddhist chants—likely a mid-grade talisman for stabilizing the mind, though its origins were unclear.  

Instantly, He Changkong's convulsions ceased. His ferocious expression smoothed over as he regained his composure.  

Without a word, he downed two vials of mid-grade [Spirit Nourishing Elixir], slapped a Qi Restoration Talisman onto his chest, and then summoned a massive yellow seal from his storage pouch.  

The seal bore forty-nine mountain-like engravings—a mid-grade artifact pulsating with oppressive might.  

A heavy-hitting offensive treasure.  

Wang Chan's expression shifted.  

To breach defenses, one either relied on pinpoint strikes like his white needles or overwhelming brute force.  

The latter was far more devastating in direct combat.  

With forty-nine mountain projections and flawless control, this was undoubtedly a fully refined artifact.  

Wang Chan recalled the bearded man mentioning He Changkong's mid-grade treasure—the [Little Flat Mountain Seal]. This had to be it.  

The seal floated forward, its weight alone causing the ground to sink.  

Boom!  

One strike shattered the first Earth Prison barrier.  

Boom!  

The second barrier collapsed.  

Just as the third strike threatened to crush Wang Chan outright—  

Hummm!  

Three more mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans activated, encasing Wang Chan and Su Jue in yellow light.  

He Changkong's face stiffened.  

Where did he get so many mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans? Such niche talismans were rare in the market.  

But there was no turning back now. He drove the seal down again.  

Boom! Boom! Boom!  

Three more strikes obliterated the barriers.  

Surely he couldn't have more?  

Yet Wang Chan casually flicked out five more Earth Prison Talismans.  

And judging by his demeanor, his sleeves likely held even more.  

"Pfft—!"  

Already struggling with unstable Qi, He Changkong coughed up a mouthful of blood in sheer frustration.
