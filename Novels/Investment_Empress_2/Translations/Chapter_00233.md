# Chapter 233: That Monkey is Quite Good-Looking, a Moment of Eternity (1/2)

Because a certain ice lump had returned to simple living, Sword City had invited Elders Qian and Xue to the city as senior representatives. Even Senior Brother Shen Yunfei and the others received invitations.

It was evident that the higher-ups of Sword City intended to establish a mutually beneficial friendship with the Clear Abyss Sect.

Therefore, the tavern was exceptionally quiet.

Ouyang and Junior Brother Tang Xiaobao were huddled together, looking towards a corner.

Junior Brother Li was sitting there, staring blankly at a drawing in a trance.

"What's wrong with Junior Brother Li?"

Tang Xiaobao wasn't attending the banquet because he could only sit at the children's table, and he couldn't find a seat in Sword City.

"He's been sitting there looking at that drawing the whole time."

"Could it be something good to look at?"

Ouyang couldn't help but feel curious.

Yesterday, Junior Brother Li had said his aesthetic sense needed improvement, and Ouyang had tossed and turned all night, unable to figure it out.

In which direction did his aesthetic sense need to improve?

"It's still lacking a bit."

"I'll strive to brand the Divine Intent into my Soul Spirit tonight..."

Li Mo snapped back to reality, rubbing his aching brow.

Then he saw a person and a pill staring at him with wide and small eyes respectively.

"What is it?"

"So, Junior Brother Li, this is the direction of aesthetic improvement you mentioned?"

Ouyang looked at the monkey in the drawing and leaned back slightly.

"......"

Li Mo wanted to say he was observing the Divine Intent.

But considering that no one else could see the fluctuations of the Divine Intent from this drawing, he ultimately nodded.

"Isn't this good-looking?"

"That's a monkey, Junior Brother Li!"

Ouyang looked as if his worldview was crumbling. He painfully pulled out yesterday's "good-looking" picture book.

"Junior Brother Li, take a good look again. Which one is truly good-looking?"

The picture book was brought right up close, covering Junior Brother Li's eyes.

However, he pushed the picture book away, completely ignoring the lifelike, scantily clad girls on it, and said with a firm expression:

"The monkey is good-looking."

"Eh?"

Ouyang's worldview was crumbling even more.

Junior Brother Li's gaze was as firm as when he was young and said he wanted to learn painting.

His parents beat him half to death, but he remained just as firm.

"Junior Brother Li, there's a big problem with your aesthetic sense."

"There's no problem."

Li Mo stated matter-of-factly.

Ouyang looked serious, frowning as he said, "Then why don't we ask everyone in the tavern which one is good-looking."

He thought his own path was crooked enough.

He didn't expect Junior Brother Li to be even more exaggerated. It couldn't even be called crooked anymore.

It was simply bizarre.

But Ouyang had forgotten that all the other senior brothers and sisters had gone to Hengyun Sword City. The only one present was Tang Xiaobao.

"I also think the monkey is good-looking. It looks very smart."

"Not like me..."

Tang Xiaobao looked at Ouyang with a strange expression.

The innocent confusion in his eyes seemed to say:

*'Come on, you actually think girls are better-looking than monkeys? What kind of eyes do you have?'*

Ouyang was struck as if by lightning.

His pupils trembled.

"A person can't... at least shouldn't..."

Junior Brother Li didn't know how to explain it to Senior Brother Ouyang.

Anyway, he had rested enough, so he continued to observe the Divine Intent.

His consciousness sank into his Dantian, where he saw a crystal-clear small figure.

Using his spirit as a knife, he began to carve that stone monkey next to the Moon Shadow Divine Mark.

It was very slow and very difficult.

This was different from observing the Mona Lisa.

Junior Brother Li found it strange himself.

One was a Great Dao Divine Form, the other was an Extreme Form. Why was the latter so much more difficult to cultivate?

Is Monkey Brother too difficult to brand?

Or is it that although the Mona Lisa is a Great Dao Divine Form, it has characteristics that make it easier to observe for him?

Or is it... both?

...

Time flowed quietly.

The mission's subtitles still hung silently in the air.

Ying Bing wanted to brew some tea.

But upon remembering that the tea leaves were inside the big-headed doll, she gently retracted her hand.

Go with the flow?

But this wasn't natural.

Should she just go downstairs, walk straight up to Li Mo, and say: Let me kiss you?

---

Perhaps in the past, because of the system's rewards, she truly wouldn't have cared about such trivial matters and would have just done it.

After all, it was just their lips touching. They had even slept in the same bed before, so why be so coy?

But now she found it strange herself. What exactly was she hesitating about...

"Can't this reward just be abandoned..."

【Ding—】

【This punishment can be abandoned, you know.】

"Why didn't you say so before?"

Ying Bing remembered that she had refused before too.

【Because the system did not detect the host saying the words 'abandon'.】

Ying Bing: "....."

Does that mean if she hadn't accidentally said those words, she would never have known?

【Hint: Abandoning anything comes at a cost, including rewards.】

【If you abandon the evaluation reward, one of the system's ranking rewards will also be randomly recalled.]

Randomly recalled ranking rewards?

Ying Bing's mind stirred.

Although the system wasn't very smart, its rewards were all excellent.

Among the three rewards from last night.

The accumulation of Moon Soul Crystals allowed her to break through to the Three Apertures realm today.

The Demon Slaying Gourd was miraculous; it could slay evil demons and turn them into the purest Primordial Qi, capable of replenishing玄晶 (Xuan Crystals) and even Moon Soul Crystal energy.

And then there were those pair of Azure Luan wings.

If she were to lose any one of these three rewards, she would have even less of a chance to turn the tables next time.

"Let's go see him first..."

Ying Bing pressed her lips together and took light steps.

She had just reached the first floor when she happened to run into the two who were still arguing.

It was Tang Xiaobao and Ouyang.

"Senior Brother Xiaobao, obviously the girls are better-looking."

"But I really think the monkey is good-looking. That monkey looks so smart."

Hearing the footsteps, both of them saw Ying Bing.

Ouyang decided to ask Junior Sister Ying to judge.

"?"

Hearing their question, Ying Bing furrowed her beautiful brows.

"What monkey?"

"The one Junior Brother Li drew."

"And this one..."

"Is from my hand."

Ouyang said with full confidence.

Ying Bing thought for a moment.

"The monkey is good-looking."

"!"

Ouyang was petrified on the spot.

*Damn it, am I actually the most normal person in the Clear Abyss Sect?*

"I told you so," Tang Xiaobao said, hands on his hips.

Ying Bing walked to the back courtyard.

She raised her eyes slightly and saw Li Mo lying on a lounge chair with his eyes closed and steady breathing.

He seemed to be... asleep?

Ying Bing subconsciously let out a breath of relief.

The longer it takes, the more things can go wrong.

Seeing that Li Mo didn't even get up to greet her as she got closer, she bit her lips and quickly pecked him on the forehead.

Then she immediately stood up, pretending nothing had happened. Her jade hand stroked the big-headed doll to soothe her mood, while her mind was filled with chaotic thoughts, such as what if Li Mo suddenly woke up, what should she say?

She could say...

"The moonlight is lovely tonight?"

But Li Mo didn't wake up.

The system didn't react either.

A kiss on the forehead doesn't count?

【Hint keyword: Kiss.】

Ying Bing: "...."

Her gaze shifted downwards, landing on the少年's (youth's) face as if in a deep slumber, and those two eloquent lips.

Should... she kiss there?

Her jade-like face remained expressionless, but she suddenly felt the sound of her own heartbeat was very loud.

The night wind blew, and the leaves rustled.

Under the moonlight.

The少女 (maiden) bathed in the clear moonlight quickly lowered her body.

Her movements were fast, but for some reason, she felt time was passing slowly. A single moment felt as long as eternity.

Li Mo was completely unaware that his first kiss was gone.

He probably couldn't even dream of who took his first kiss...

Finally, that moment of eternity passed.

Their lips touched for an instant.

"Mm?"

Li Mo's eyelids twitched.
