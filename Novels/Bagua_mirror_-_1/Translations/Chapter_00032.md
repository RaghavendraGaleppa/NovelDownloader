# Chapter 32: Crimson-Eyed Silver Python  

"Whew! Finally finished setting it up. We need to speed up—if they come back to steal it, we'll need to dig out as much as we can to make it worth our while."  

After deploying the Golden Aegis Formation, Song Jinpeng spoke up.  

However, a few hours later, the situation Qin Chong had anticipated unfolded.  

With a thunderous *boom!*, the Golden Aegis Formation was struck.  

The three of them didn’t immediately stop mining the spirit stones, though they kept their spiritual senses focused on the situation outside the formation. The cultivator from earlier had returned, this time with three late-stage Qi Refining cultivators in tow.  

"Old Song, how long can your Golden Aegis Formation hold under this kind of assault?"  

"Given their current attack strength, it should last at least half an hour."  

"Then let’s signal the patrol team for backup."  

"My thoughts exactly."  

Outside, the four attackers were momentarily stalled by the formation’s barrier. After a brief discussion, they began a coordinated assault. For Qi Refining cultivators, breaking through even a low-tier formation like this required brute force.  

After just fifteen minutes, the Golden Aegis Formation began to waver, its barrier flickering violently.  

"Liao Xiong, go reinforce the formation."  

Liao Xiong never hesitated when it came to Song Jinpeng’s orders.  

With Liao Xiong channeling his spiritual energy into the formation, it managed to hold for a while longer. However, Liao Xiong was visibly drained and on the verge of collapse.  

Suddenly, the attacks from outside ceased, replaced by the sounds of combat—the patrol team’s five cultivators had finally arrived. A chaotic battle erupted in the cramped space outside.  

The scene was bizarre: a brawl raged outside while Qin Chong and Song Jinpeng continued frantically mining spirit stones inside. Thankfully, the Golden Aegis Formation’s barrier obscured the view, preventing the rescuers from seeing what they were up to. If the patrol team found out, they’d skin the two alive.  

Moments later, the situation outside shifted again. It seemed the Qingxuan Sect cultivators had also called for reinforcements, and the patrol team found themselves caught in a pincer attack.  

With the Qingxuan Sect members now free to act, they resumed their assault on the formation.  

"This is bad. We need to retreat now, or it’ll be too late."  

Qin Chong finally stopped digging, his expression grim.  

"Let’s go. Damn shame about my Golden Aegis Formation, though—cost me hundreds of spirit stones." Song Jinpeng winced at the loss.  

"No time to worry about that. Move!"  

"Liao Xiong, let’s go!"  

With that, the three of them dashed into the branching tunnels behind them. In their haste, Qin Chong took one path alone, while Song Jinpeng and Liao Xiong took another.  

---  

As Qin Chong fled down the tunnel, he could still hear distant roars—likely reinforcements from the Canglong Valley had arrived. *Are they playing some kind of twisted game?*  

Before long, the Qingxuan Sect cultivators were forced to retreat, leaving behind several corpses. The Canglong Valley side had also suffered casualties.  

At the last moment, the Golden Aegis Formation shattered.  

When the patrol team finally entered, they found the chamber empty—only half-excavated spirit stone veins remained.  

Though frustrated, the patrol team had no choice but to accept the situation. In the face of overwhelming odds, survival took precedence.  

Qin Chong ran without stopping, unsure how far he’d gone or how many turns he’d taken. Only when he felt safe did he finally slow down.  

From the start, he knew he’d been separated from Song Jinpeng and Liao Xiong. For Qin Chong, this wasn’t a major concern—as long as all three escaped safely, it was already a stroke of luck.  

He wasn’t familiar with this area, but after nearly two years of working in the mines, he’d learned to navigate the tunnels. Most of the branching paths had been dug out by miners, leaving telltale marks on the walls. By following these traces and judging the size of the passages, he could eventually find his way back to the main tunnel.  

His biggest worry now was running into Qingxuan Sect cultivators. Both factions were operating in teams underground, and encountering one meant facing an entire group.  

Qin Chong proceeded with extreme caution.  

After scouting the area, he found a hiding spot and set up his Five Elements Concealment Formation. Once concealed, he began meditating to recover his energy.  

Alone now, he abandoned any thought of continuing to mine spirit stones. His priority was to locate the main tunnel and escape.  

No amount of spirit stones was worth risking his life—that much was clear.  

Several days passed, and Qin Chong grew increasingly frustrated. He was truly lost. Being lost underground was no trivial matter.  

Then, as he searched for a way out, he sensed a disturbance in the spiritual energy.  

*Cultivators fighting?*  

Wait—  

*There’s a demon beast’s aura too? A second-tier demon beast?*  

Second-tier beasts were equivalent to Foundation Establishment cultivators. Yet the cultivators fighting it were all still in the Qi Refining stage. How were they holding their own?  

Normally, Qin Chong would steer clear of such a battle. But with no way out, following these cultivators might lead him to an exit—assuming they didn’t end up as the beast’s meal.  

From the fluctuating auras, the fight seemed evenly matched. The second-tier beast’s energy was erratic, surging and waning unpredictably.  

Qin Chong pushed his concealment technique to its limits and crept closer.  

As he approached, he realized something odd—two of the auras felt familiar. He couldn’t place them immediately, but they were definitely from the Canglong Valley faction. That meant his chances of finding an exit had just improved.  

He was in a narrow side tunnel, barely wide enough for one person.  

A glow spilled from the tunnel’s mouth—moonlight stones, and more than one.  

*Are these people seriously using moonlight stones in the middle of a fight?*  

Qin Chong moved even more cautiously, holding his breath as he neared the exit.  

The cavern beyond was massive—dozens of feet across and nearly twenty feet high. The ground was littered with scattered rubble of varying sizes.  

*"A second-tier Crimson-Eyed Silver Python!"*  

The sight of the beast sent a shock through Qin Chong.  

The Crimson-Eyed Silver Python was no ordinary creature. Though he didn’t know its exact lineage or rank, Zhao Yin’s *Compendium of Basic Spiritual Creatures* had a detailed entry on it.  

The description matched perfectly—the appearance, the aura—it was unmistakably the same beast.  

According to the records, this creature was incredibly powerful. Its scales were nearly impenetrable, resistant even to high-grade magical artifacts. It could spit deadly venom and unleash a corrosive silver flame capable of dissolving spiritual energy.  

Even a second-tier early-stage Silver Python could overpower two or three early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. So how were four Qi Refining cultivators managing to suppress it?
