Chapter 61: My title is Yuanshi Tianzun!

The sun was high in the sky at noon. The carriage rode towards Qingyuan Mountain, bathed in sunlight. The buildings on the main peak of Qingyuan Mountain were already visible, their unique layout standing out against the green mountains. It was unclear who the mastermind behind this design was.

But Li Mo's mind kept wandering back to the scene from half an hour ago. The little beggar girl had removed the cloth covering her eyes, revealing a pair of clear gray-white pupils that seemed pure and innocent, like those of a baby. However, they also carried a hint of timidity and humility, as if she was afraid to meet someone's gaze.

Li Mo was lost in thought, recalling a certain ninja anime, when suddenly, a pale little face appeared before him. The girl's hair was still messy, and her clothes were tattered, creating a stark contrast with her face. Li Mo remembered this scene, not because of the girl's fourteen-year-old beauty, but because of her awkward posture, with her hands clasped together like a small white flower swaying in the wind.

"The color of her destiny hasn't changed; she shouldn't be discovered by the Xuntianwei," Li Mo thought to himself. "I wonder when she'll discover the uniqueness of the ancient intention ring?"

As Li Mo's thoughts wandered, he suddenly slapped his thigh. "Oh no!" he exclaimed. "I forgot to tell her to recognize the ring as her own by dripping blood on it!"

His companion, Murong Xiao, who was dozing off beside him, opened his eyes, looking puzzled. "What's wrong, Li Mo?" he asked.

Li Mo was filled with regret. He had designed the ring to require the user's blood to recognize their aura, but in his haste to leave, he had forgotten to inform the girl.

That night, smoke rose from the chimneys in Nijiao Alley. The disabled beggar children busied themselves, tidying up the dilapidated courtyard. They were now making it their home, thanks to Li Mo.

As they worked, they chatted among themselves. "Jiejie has been in a daze all day," one of them said. "Hehe, I think she's thinking about Li Mo." "Me too; he makes the best food." "I want to join Qingyuan Sect too, so I can see him every day."

Meanwhile, Jiang Chulong sat alone, polishing the exquisite ring on her finger. When she heard the others mention Li Mo, she was reminded that the ring was actually prepared by Mei Yi, not Li Mo. She wondered why Mei Yi had given her such a ring, which didn't seem to have any special properties.

"I must find out what's going on," Jiang Chulong thought, her lips pursed in determination. She was anxious, thinking that she might have done something wrong. After losing her Jian Gu, she had lost a certain color in her world.

As she clutched the ring tightly, she felt a stinging pain in her finger. Suddenly, a drop of blood fell from her finger, staining the ring with a hint of enchanting light.

The world around her began to spin, and Jiang Chulong felt a wave of dizziness. She heard the voices of the children calling out to her, but they gradually faded away.

When she opened her eyes again, she found herself in a boundless expanse of white mist, as if she had transcended the mortal realm. The area was not large, spanning only about 500 meters, but it was filled with intricately designed buildings that seemed to be crafted by the heavens themselves.

A deep, resonant laughter echoed through the air. "Little friend, you're a guest from afar. Please come in," a voice said.

Jiang Chulong hesitantly stepped forward, entering a courtyard with a ancient tree at its center. A figure sat on a blue stone, clad in white robes, with a bronze mask covering his face. The air around him was filled with ever-changing phenomena and Dao rhythms, as if he had been there since the birth of the universe.

"Senior, where is this place?" Jiang Chulong asked cautiously.

"This? It's just a cave dwelling I created in my leisure, outside the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands," the man replied, his voice calm and unruffled.

Jiang Chulong's eyes widened in shock. "Outside the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands?" she repeated.

The man chuckled. "Don't worry, I can send you back. It's just a small trick."

With a wave of his hand, a stool and a stone table with tea utensils appeared. "Sit down," he said.

Jiang Chulong sat down, still in a daze. "Who are you, Senior?" she asked. "And why did you bring me here?"

The man pondered for a moment before responding, "My title is... Yuanshi Tianzun."

As he spoke, a loud clap of thunder boomed outside, and the sky turned a deep shade of white. Jiang Chulong looked up, startled, and saw the figure of the man becoming clearer, bathed in the stark contrast of black and white. His presence was awe-inspiring, exuding an aura of vastness and transcendence.
