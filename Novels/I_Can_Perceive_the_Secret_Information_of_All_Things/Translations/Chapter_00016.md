# Chapter 16: Defending the Primordial Temple  

Xiao Ji returned to the Primordial Temple with a young woman in tow.  

This excited his master greatly.  

"What a lovely girl," Liu Haizhu remarked from his rocking chair in the main hall, eyeing Yingxiao with a cheerful grin.  

"Master, this is Yingxiao. A fine surname—same as the imperial family of our Great Li Kingdom," Xiao Ji introduced her. "She's had a falling out with her family and has nowhere to stay for now. Once she comes to terms with things..."  

"I'll never come to terms with it," Yingxiao interjected sharply, her expression darkening at the unpleasant memory.  

"You will, sooner or later. Some things just need time," Xiao Ji said gently. "Once you let go, everything will fall into place."  

As the esteemed third princess of Great Li, she would inevitably return to the capital, Dragon City. Her reluctance now was likely just a passing phase.  

Xiao Ji had already made plans for her future. If she didn’t return to Dragon City, he would train her in household chores—cooking, cleaning, and laundry. If she tried to leave for other adventures, however, he wouldn’t allow it. She was far too valuable.  

"Our Primordial Temple welcomes all—not just a single girl, but even kind-hearted spirits in need," Liu Haizhu said magnanimously. "Now, tell me, what caused this rift with your family?"  

Yingxiao gathered her thoughts and began, "My family was happy at first. But after my mother passed away, my father remarried. My stepmother disliked me and constantly whispered in his ear, pushing me to marry the scoundrel next door..."  

Xiao Ji nodded along, mentally translating her words.  

*After the queen’s death, the king favored his new consort, who naturally saw the former queen’s daughter as a threat. Trying to drive her out of the palace was just politics as usual.*  

Yingxiao continued, "So I left my home, filled with memories, determined to build an empire that could rival my father’s."  

Xiao Ji: "..."  

*The third princess is plotting rebellion!*  

A quick scan of Yingxiao’s thoughts confirmed it—her dream was to overthrow her father and claim the throne, all to prove herself.  

Dreams change with circumstances, and Xiao Ji was confident he could gently steer her ambitions in time. After all, according to his knowledge, she was the king’s most beloved daughter—she just couldn’t see it.  

"Speaking of determination," Liu Haizhu suddenly mused, "I recall a Great Ascension fox spirit from two thousand years ago. Her meridians were blocked, and it was through sheer effort that I helped clear them..."  

Xiao Ji sighed inwardly. *Any word can trigger Master’s storytelling mode.*  

He had no idea how many tales his master had stored away. This fox spirit story was new to him. If Liu Haizhu was improvising, he was a true talent—wasted on temple life instead of storytelling.  

"Great Ascension fox spirit? Impressive!" Yingxiao’s eyes sparkled as she scooted her stool closer. "Did she have many tails?"  

"Of course!" Liu Haizhu, invigorated by her enthusiasm, sat up straighter. "Dozens of them."  

"Tell me the details! How were her meridians blocked? I bet it was sabotage by other demons... And how did you help? With your hands, or some artifact...?"  

Xiao Ji stood to the side, feeling utterly superfluous as the two launched into animated conversation.  

"The story begins when the fox spirit was just a child. In fact, I was her first mentor in cultivation," Liu Haizhu declared, his face brimming with nostalgia. "I watched her grow from Qi Refining all the way to Core Formation, then helped her break through to Nascent Soul, and later..."  

"Hold on, Master, you skipped a few stages," Xiao Ji interjected, eager to assert his presence. "The standard path is Qi Refining—twelve layers before Foundation Establishment, then Core Formation, Nascent Soul, and Spirit Transformation for the lower realms, each with early, middle, and late phases."  

"Then come the middle realms—Void Refining, Unity, and Great Ascension—before immortality. And fox spirits don’t follow Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment—they’re born with demon cores..."  

A heavy silence fell over the hall, broken only by the crackling of the brazier’s flames.  

"It's getting late. Go cook dinner—prepare a few proper dishes and warm some wine," Liu Haizhu dismissed Xiao Ji. Turning back to Yingxiao, he said, "Now, Lady Gongsun, where were we?"  

"It's Ying," she corrected.  

Just as Xiao Ji headed to the backyard, three menacing figures strode into the temple.  

The tallest and burliest of them, a man with sparse eyebrows, scanned the hall before barking at Liu Haizhu, "Old Master, my lord sent us to ask again—when will you sell the Primordial Temple?"  

"Give me a few more days to consider," Liu Haizhu replied calmly.  

"A few more days? You’ve been saying that for months now!" the man snapped. "If it’s about money, my lord’s final offer is three thousand taels. You know as well as we do—this temple’s reputation is ruined. No one comes here anymore, and the rumors say it’s cursed!"  

"My lord is being generous. Three thousand taels could last you and your disciple decades if you’re frugal."  

Before Xiao Ji could respond, Yingxiao cut in, "Bandits! Thieves! Scoundrels! Three thousand taels for such a grand temple? That wouldn’t even buy a decent robe! Guards, drag them away—"  

Both allies and enemies stared at her in bewilderment.  

"You’re not from this temple. Stay out of this," the eyebrow-deficient man growled before refocusing on Liu Haizhu. "You’re squatting on valuable land. Let someone capable take over—this place could be put to better use."  

Xiao Ji stood within three zhang of the intruders, his perception active.  

**[Yangliu Town, servants of the Tu family. Sent to purchase the Primordial Temple’s land. Three months ago, the current Tu patriarch chose this site for a pleasure house. These three were tasked with tarnishing the temple’s reputation.]**  

**[They spread rumors that the temple was haunted, claiming visitors would invite misfortune.]**  

**[The Tu family also hired a rogue cultivator. If negotiations fail, this dark practitioner will unleash horrors upon the temple.]**  

Now that the culprits had revealed themselves, Xiao Ji’s resolve hardened.  

*I must protect the Primordial Temple at all costs.*
