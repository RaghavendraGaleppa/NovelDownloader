Chapter 195: The Hengyun Hammer City? He Lives Up to the Name of Sword Immortal!

At the top of the Sword Tower, the atmosphere fell into a strange silence.

Li Mo looked at the Sword Mark... or rather, the strange stone with the Hammer Imprint, and couldn't help but fall into deep thought.

Most likely, without a doubt, the "Heaven Overturning, Earth Shaking, Human Path Killing Hammer Technique" he had just comprehended was at least a Divine Skill.

And the Sword Mark on the strange stone had just happened to be wiped away by the Ice Cube.

Thus, the Panjie Meteorite Hammer had stamped its mark upon the strange stone.

The Hammer Treasure was currently quite happy inside the World Seed.

Little Li was actually quite happy too, after all, this hammer technique was so domineering.

He was just afraid that if he laughed, he would get beaten.

"The Hammer Technique..."

Ying Bing stared at the Hammer Imprint, her jade-like face slightly dazed.

She couldn't help but recall the scene in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

No... that's not right.

The aura of this hammer strike was different... the level was worlds apart.

Above Supreme Techniques, there is only Divine Skill.

She had never seen Li Mo practice the hammer technique before, so why...

Zhong Zhenyue's scalp went numb. Even if he were beaten to death, he never would have imagined that Master Li had held back that day.

"Huh? What are you doing?" Zhong Zhenyue saw Huang Donglai take out a notebook again, sweating profusely as he wrote something.

Huang Donglai shook his head. He originally wanted to cross out the first entry, but after thinking about it, he added a "Zeroth" entry in front of it.

Wu Chushu was sweating profusely, gradually understanding all of Bai Jinghong's previous actions.

"Why didn't you say so earlier?"

"You didn't ask."

"How could I ask if you didn't say?"

"How could I say if you didn't ask?"

...

The Elders were greatly shocked. After being stunned for a long time, they slowly came back to their senses.

"The Sword Mark on our Sword City... is gone?"

"Does that mean we can't call it Hengyun Sword City anymore?"

"I'm thinking about how to handle the next Martial Arts Summit. What will those who ascend the Sword Tower see?"

"I'm already old, it's too late for me to switch to practicing martial arts!"

...

The Elders all muttered to themselves.

"Haha, I must still be dreaming."

Elder Zeng laughed, pulling hard on his beard and tearing out several strands of gray-white hair.

Then he froze.

It hurt.

This wasn't a dream, and he wasn't seeing things. The Hengyun Sword Mark was indeed gone.

It had turned into a Hammer Imprint.

"Jiang... Li Mo! What have you done!"

Elder Zeng put on a pained expression, not knowing if it was from heartache or from pulling out too much beard:

"How can you face us?"

"My apologies, I am truly sorry!"

Li Mo sincerely apologized.

Indeed, he had accidentally wiped out the signboard of their Sword City.

According to Sword City's propaganda, this Sword Mark had existed since ancient times. It was the faith of their sect and the pride and aspiration of many disciples.

If this were his past life, it would be like he had wiped out the corporate image with a single hammer.

It was like swapping the ice cream cone in the Snow King's hand for a cigarette...

"How can you face the vast number of fans?!"

"Huh?"

"Jiang Chen's persona is a gentleman, but you're using a hammer? Refund!"

Elder Zeng seemed even angrier than the other Elders.

Li Mo: "..."

So you don't care about the Sword Mark at all?

Well, after venting his personal emotions, Elder Zeng said breathlessly:

"Now, what should we do?"

The Elders fell silent, their expressions complex.

This kid had just helped them out tremendously.

Who could have imagined that while he helped preserve Hengyun Sword City, he didn't do it completely, and turned around to remove the "Sword" from it.

"Is this Sword Mark truly ancient and eternal?"

Ying Bing suddenly asked.

The Elders nodded.

Ying Bing raised her eyebrows slightly, feeling that the Sword Mark she had erased felt somewhat familiar, as if she had seen it somewhere before.

---

"Could I ask Miss Ying to make a move and erase this Hammer Imprint, then leave a new Sword Mark?" Elder Zeng asked.

Ying Bing shook her head with a complex expression.

It wasn't that she didn't want to, but that she couldn't...

Both being Divine Skills, the sword technique she comprehended was not as complete as Li Mo's hammer technique.

"I... I have a method..."

At this moment, a怯弱 (timid) voice rang out.

Everyone quickly looked over and saw that the speaker was Jiang Chulong.

Being watched by so many people, she shrank her small shoulders and looked a bit nervous.

"What method?"

"I can... try..."

"You?"

The Elders exchanged glances. This little girl's talent in the Sword Dao was something they had never seen before. Perhaps there was a sliver of hope?

There were no other options left at this point.

Having received their approval, Jiang Chulong gathered her courage and walked up.

*Pata—*

She ran over, kicked the strange stone, and then quickly ran back to hide behind Li Mo.

Everyone: "!"

The Elders felt as if their hearts had been kicked.

"Hmmmm"

Li Mo reacted first and gave her a thumbs up. Smart, as expected of someone who had been influenced by him, a genius.

Jiang Chulong pursed her lips and weakly stretched out a finger:

"Flip this stone... stone... over... then you won't... won't see it."

The Elders: "..."

What a simple method.

But having it empty was indeed better than showing the Hammer Imprint.

They had tested it just now.

The Hammer Imprint didn't affect comprehension. Those who were supposed to comprehend sword techniques from the strange stone would still comprehend sword techniques.

"Then let's just tell the outside world that it was because Ying Bing comprehended a sword technique that was too shocking."

"That's why the strange stone was flipped over. That makes sense."

Li Mo thought for a moment and spoke.

The Elders' mouths twitched. They took a deep breath, but they could only do this to preserve the "Sword" character of Sword City.

What a disaster!

"Everything happens for a reason. Perhaps this is the destiny of the strange stone."

A voice rang out.

The long-haired youth who had just supported the heavens and earth of Sword City, and the old man with the face of a child and hair like a crane, arrived together.

"The strange stone is originally a gift from the heavens. Perhaps many ages ago, what was imprinted on it wasn't a sword technique at all. It just happened to be imprinted with a sword technique when it was acquired by our ancestors."

The long-haired youth glanced at Li Mo, and the corner of his eye twitched.

It was hard to say how much of what he said was against his true will.

"Everyone, please come with us."

The old man with the face of a child and hair like a crane spoke.

He was addressing all the geniuses who had comprehended the strange stone.

Of course.

He was mainly addressing Li Mo and the others.

After some discussion, they all accepted this fact.

Elder Zeng walked to the front and announced in a loud voice:

"Miss Ying Bing has comprehended a Divine Skill sword technique from the strange stone!"

"As for Li Mo... what he comprehended was also shocking, and it is hard to say who is superior between him and Miss Ying."

"But there can only be one Sword Hero. Therefore, he voluntarily conceded."

"I announce that she has claimed the title of Sword Hero in this Martial Arts Summit!"

There was no other way, they had to make the lie convincing.

If they actually awarded the Sword Hero title to Li Mo, the Elders would wake up in the middle of the night feeling like they were the eternal sinners of the sect.

Their ancestors would be rolling in their graves.

...

The sound reached those below, and countless people began to whisper and discuss incessantly.

"I naturally acknowledge Miss Ying's unparalleled talent, but..."

"Yeah, no matter how you look at it, the fluctuation from Master Li's actions seemed greater."

"That's right, I think this is unfair to Master Li."

"Ignorance, it's clear you've never had a girlfriend."

"Are you asking for a beating?"

"Tell me if I'm wrong. Young Hero Li already has the name of Sword Immortal, what does it matter if he doesn't take a mere Sword Hero title?"

"It seems Young Hero Li not only treats money like dirt, but also doesn't care about mere fame. He... truly lives up to the name of Sword Immortal."

"He has broadened his horizons. His Sword Dao is above all other swordsmen!"
