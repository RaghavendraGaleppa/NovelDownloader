# Chapter 153: Borrowing Passage

Li Shiming and Yin Shilan walked along the mountain path of Zhong Peak. The steep trail posed no challenge for either of them.

Even the sect's cultivators tactfully made way, leaving the two their own quiet space.

"Lan'er, you took too great a risk!" Li Shiming said with a mix of heartache and helplessness as he looked at Yin Shilan beside him.

He didn't want her breakthrough to be affected just to save a Foundation Establishment Pill. No matter how talented one was, advancing from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment was a critical juncture.

Hadn't they seen how even someone as gifted as Baili Jinyan, with all his accumulated resources, still prepared a Foundation Establishment Pill for himself?

A cultivator had few chances to attempt Foundation Establishment in their lifetime, and the first attempt held the highest probability of success. Subsequent attempts would see drastically reduced odds—less than one-tenth of the original chance.

The thought made Li Shiming shudder with fear. If Yin Shilan had failed her breakthrough, the consequences would have been dire.

"It wasn't that dangerous," Yin Shilan replied with a radiant smile. "If I'd truly needed it, I would have used the pill."

She knew Li Shiming had a triple spiritual root. Given the scarcity of Foundation Establishment Pills, even with sufficient merit points, obtaining one would take time.

With the sect producing only about ten pills every five years, each one was exceedingly precious.

Even as the direct descendant of a sect elder, she had only managed to exchange merit points for a single pill when she needed it.

Of course, if her aptitude had been poor, Elder Yin would have prepared one for her.

But Yin Shilan wouldn't ask her father for an extra pill. The only way she could secure one for Li Shiming was by saving the one meant for herself, giving him an additional chance at breaking through.

Compared to Qi Refining, a Foundation Establishment cultivator's lifespan was extended by nearly fifty years.

But the difference wasn't just in longevity—it was about future prospects.

A Foundation Establishment cultivator still had the hope of advancing to the Golden Core stage and attaining an even longer lifespan. In contrast, a Qi Refining cultivator would gradually decline in vitality as their lifespan waned, eventually succumbing to old age.

"I'll accept the Foundation Establishment Pill," Li Shiming said, no longer refusing her heartfelt gesture. "Uncle Yin mentioned that my breakthrough might be troublesome. I haven't exchanged for a pill from the sect yet, but by the time I reach the peak of Qi Refining, I should have enough merit points. Then, I’ll have an extra pill."

He glanced around. In his busy life across the Nine Peaks, he had never taken the time to appreciate the scenery.

Now, standing amidst the drifting mist, he realized the breathtakingly beautiful immortal realm depicted in the films of his past life was right before his eyes—so surreal it felt like a dream.

Especially with Yin Shilan standing gracefully in this ethereal landscape, her presence adding boundless charm to the scenery.

Li Shiming couldn't tell whether it was the beauty of the surroundings or the woman beside him that intoxicated him. For a moment, he forgot his worries, forgot about cultivation, wishing only that this moment could last forever.

Yin Shilan leaned quietly against him, savoring his presence.

During her four-month seclusion, the only thing that had occupied her thoughts was Li Shiming.

Seeing him the moment she emerged had instantly fulfilled her longing.

As if deliberately interrupting them, Elder Yin sent a message to Yin Shilan, informing her of the details surrounding Zhuge Xuan's death.

Neither Elder Yin nor Li Shiming had anticipated Yin Shilan's reaction to the news.

Yin Shilan suddenly turned to Li Shiming, her almond-shaped eyes filled first with fear and worry, then relief and joy. She tightened her embrace around him.

"I almost lost you," she murmured.

While she was saddened by Zhuge Xuan's death, the message from her father revealed that Li Shiming had also been attacked and narrowly escaped. First came the dread, then overwhelming relief.

She couldn't imagine how she would endure life without him.

"My life is tough. Believe me, even if you ever hear bad news about me, don't accept it. I'll always return, riding on clouds of seven colors," Li Shiming whispered, gently holding her and pressing his lips to her forehead.

Unlike Yin Shilan, Li Shiming had already faced life-and-death situations multiple times in his short cultivation journey.

He felt the depth of her affection and didn’t want her to lose hope over any news about him.

He sensed her body trembling slightly, her warm tears falling onto him and trickling down his skin.

The wind brushed past Yin Shilan's robes and Li Shiming's cultivation attire, tangling their hair together before scattering it in the breeze.

In the distance, Elder Yin suppressed the urge to smack Li Shiming.

He hadn’t expected the tragic news he’d sent to drive them apart—instead, it had deepened their bond.

Before the Seven Stars Island, a massive flying vessel hovered in the air.

The seven Golden Core cultivators of the island unleashed their formidable auras, amplified by the Big Dipper Formation, to deter the vessel.

From the flying vessel, three equally powerful Golden Core auras rose in response. Neither side made the first move.

"Which faction do you belong to, and why have you entered the territory of the Seven Sects?" Elder Gu of the Tianhai Sect demanded.

"We are from the Mingxin Sect of Northern Shu, seeking passage!" a Golden Core cultivator emerged from the vessel, his tone solemn.

"Passage? There is no path ahead. Our Seven Sects mark the northernmost boundary. Do you intend to cross into the Sea of Death?" Elder Gu's expression darkened.

Elder Gu and the other six Golden Core elders understood the gravity of the situation. Northern Shu cultivators appearing here, combined with the earlier Golden Core sword cultivator—was something major happening in Northern Shu?

As for "borrowing passage," where exactly? Ahead lay the territory of the Seven Great Sects, which would never permit large numbers of foreign cultivators to approach.

This massive flying vessel was of the super-large class, capable of carrying over a thousand cultivators. Moreover, the presence of three Golden Core cultivators alone posed a significant threat.

If these three possessed combat strength comparable to the earlier Golden Core sword cultivator, even the Seven Stars Island might struggle to hold them off.

The seven Golden Core cultivators sent distress signals to their respective sects. Reinforcements would arrive soon—they only needed to stall for time.

On the massive flying vessel, the two Golden Core cultivators observed the seated disciples filling the deck. They couldn’t afford to engage in battle recklessly.

These disciples represented the sect's future. If they suffered casualties in the conflict, the consequences would be dire.

Following the markings left by Yun Xingyi, they had navigated the perilous Northern Sea to reach the vicinity of Seven Stars Island. But Yun Xingyi's trail had vanished here.

They harbored grim suspicions—perhaps Yun Xingyi had met with misfortune. This heightened their wariness of the Golden Core cultivators ahead.

Yun Xingyi had been their sect's foremost Golden Core expert. They now had to reassess the danger level of this sea region.

The three Golden Core cultivators aboard the vessel had no desire for conflict. They, too, awaited reinforcements—more vessels were following behind.

Thus, the three Northern Shu Golden Core cultivators and the seven from the Seven Sects stood in stalemate, each side calculating their next move.

"Venerable Du Hai, do we have any concrete news from Northern Shu?" Elder Gu asked the venerable monk.

Isolated in this remote region, the Seven Sects had little access to information from across the sea.

Even for Golden Core cultivators, crossing the Northern Sea was perilous, making intelligence gathering difficult.

"Recent news from Northern Shu suggests the Dark Forest Sect in the Hundred Thousand Mountains is rapidly expanding, forcing many sects to flee," Venerable Du Hai replied gravely.

As he spoke, a flicker of hesitation crossed his eyes.

The local Wanfo Sect was merely a branch. While Wanfo branches existed across continents, they rarely communicated—yet they were all connected.

This time, using a special sect communication method, the Northern Shu Wanfo Sect had relayed more than just this news. They had hinted that their branch should prepare for evacuation.

After receiving this message, the Wanfo Sect had debated how much to disclose to the other six sects.

Given the millennia of camaraderie among the Seven Sects—despite minor conflicts—they had weathered countless crises together, forming an unshakable alliance.

But expecting the other sects to abandon their ancestral homes based on a single message was unrealistic. Even within the Wanfo Sect, most advocated holding their ground.

"So, Venerable means the earlier Golden Core sword cultivator and these vessel-bound Golden Core cultivators were all driven from Northern Shu by the Dark Forest Sect?" Elder Gu asked solemnly.

Displaced cultivators were the most dangerous, as they would stop at nothing to secure new territory.

Initially, they could rely on their accumulated resources to sustain themselves.

But over time, the lack of cultivation resources, stable environments, disciple training, and—most critically—waning morale would cripple a rootless sect.

"Let’s discuss further after the reinforcements arrive," Venerable Du Hai said cautiously.

Now that they had witnessed the scale of the incoming cultivators, he could share more with the other sects.

"Retreat the vessel into the Northern Sea!" As the first Golden Core cultivator from the Seven Sects approached the island, the Northern Shu Golden Core cultivators made their decision.

Without hesitation, the vessel turned and fled the way it had come.

One by one, Golden Core reinforcements from the Seven Sects arrived. Nearly every available Golden Core cultivator had been mobilized.

Nineteen Golden Core cultivators now stood on Seven Stars Island—each sect had sent at least one, with some sending two.

"Esteemed colleagues, the Wanfo Sect has critical news to share. Let Venerable Du Yuan deliver it," Venerable Du Hai said, nodding to the elder monk.

All eyes turned to Venerable Du Yuan. Having heard fragments of the situation from the island's defenders, they listened intently.

"The Northern Shu Wanfo Sect, our sister branch, has advised us to prepare for evacuation," Venerable Du Yuan announced firmly.

"What? Evacuate? To where?"

"After encountering just three Golden Core cultivators, we're to flee?"

"Our sects' legacies span millennia—how can we abandon them?"

The Golden Core elders voiced their disbelief. None could accept such a proposition.

"Esteemed colleagues, this is merely a warning from the Northern Shu Wanfo Sect. The enemy we may face could be formidable. Our sect does not insist others evacuate—truth be told, most of our own members oppose abandoning our home. Unless absolutely necessary, we would never consider it," Venerable Du Yuan said, pressing his palms together.

"That makes sense," some murmured in agreement.

As the initial shock faded, the Golden Core cultivators began analyzing the implications.

Clearly, the Northern Shu Wanfo Sect knew something. Extracting explicit details might be difficult—even this warning likely carried risks for them.

"Venerable Du Hai, Venerable Du Yuan, could the Wanfo Sect further liaise with Northern Shu? Any required compensation or conditions can be shared among the sects. We need detailed intelligence—who is this potential enemy?" Elder Yin addressed the two venerables.

As a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator, Elder Yin held considerable influence among the group.

Most of the Seven Sects' Golden Core cultivators were at the early stage—a result of limited techniques, resources, and cultivation environments.

Only through unity and their remote northern location had the Seven Sects endured for millennia.

Few powerful factions coveted this relatively barren region. But if displaced sects sought refuge, they might target the Seven Sects' territories.

After generations of development, the Seven Sects had significantly improved their cultivation environments.

Their primary spiritual veins now rivaled those of mid-sized sects in Northern Shu.

This was why the Seven Sects had produced so many Golden Core cultivators. Millennia of progress had brought them to this point.

"Elder Yin, our sect will strive to communicate further. However, I suspect an Nascent Soul mighty one may be involved," Venerable Du Hai revealed.

"Impossible! A sect with an Nascent Soul couldn’t defend its territory?" Even Elder Yin struggled to believe it.

An Nascent Soul was the dream of all cultivators—a true mighty one.

Each Nascent Soul enjoyed a lifespan exceeding a millennium. At the end of their natural life, they could even reincarnate and cultivate anew.

In essence, Nascent Souls wielded the laws of heaven and earth, enabling their longevity and rebirth.

The mere thought of facing such an entity was terrifying.

"Let each sect explore its connections to gather more intelligence on Northern Shu. This crisis may also be an opportunity—these fleeing cultivators carry their sects' accumulated resources, techniques, and treasures!" Elder Yin rallied the group.

While the other sects lacked direct communication channels like the Wanfo Sect, they might still procure intelligence indirectly.

What they needed now was concrete information to assess their enemy's numbers and strength—only then could they respond effectively without excessive losses.

The Golden Core cultivators pondered their sect's connections. Some eyed the approaching threat with battlelust.

Superior techniques and abundant resources could be their path to greater heights.
