# Chapter 311: Do You Want the Emperor to Die?

But for now, he could only grit his teeth and reply, "I have ordered increased patrols around the Imperial Examination Hall. If there is any unusual activity..."

"Patrols?"

The Empress let out a cold laugh, and her bone staff suddenly struck the ground with a *thud*.

The floor tiles of the Purple Extremity Hall instantly浮现ed intricate, dark red patterns. These lines were drawn with a formation mixture of cinnabar and flood dragon blood, designed to gather spiritual energy and nourish blood essence.

At that moment, the formation pulsed slightly, and both Pei Jian and Guo Lang let out muffled groans as fine threads of blood seeped from their seven orifices.

Cao An suddenly cried out shrilly, "Your Majesty! This old servant just received a secret report. That new disciple of the Dao Sect..."

Before he could finish, the Empress's murky eyes snapped toward him, instantly silencing the old eunuch.

"Xu Yunfan, I know," the Empress slowly uttered the name, the corners of her mouth twisting into a strange arc. "Disciple of the Heavenly Work Cave, achieving great completion of the Marrow Cleansing Realm in just three months... *cough cough*... That old ghost Bi Yuan truly found a treasure. These sect tumors... their fortune really is endless."

The Empress's withered fingers suddenly spread open, and a terrifying suction force erupted from her palm.

Ten zhang away, a bronze lamp stand let out a groaning sound of metal under unbearable strain. The gold-inlaid dragon patterns shattered inch by inch under the invisible force, and the entire stand, like dough kneaded by an invisible hand, collapsed in the blink of an eye into a fist-sized lump of metal.

True Qi surged in her palm, and the lump of bronze turned into golden-red fine sand with a piercing *hissing* sound, as if refined by an invisible fire, shimmering with an eerie luster.

The golden sand rustled down onto the eyeball gem at the top of the bone staff. The gray-white eyeball suddenly trembled violently, its pupil shrinking to the size of a needle tip.

Dense blood-colored patterns emerged on the surface of the staff, like awakened blood vessels, greedily devouring the golden sand.

As the last trace of golden-red light vanished into the staff, it fed back a few strands of dark red vitality. This aura, like a living thing,钻入 the Empress's cracked skin. A诡异的 flush instantly appeared in her sunken eye sockets, and her sunken chest swelled slightly.

But this vitality vanished in an instant.

The eyeball on the staff turned gray and lifeless again, and the wrinkles the Empress had just smoothed over quickly collapsed back. Only a drop of golden sand at the corner of her mouth remained to testify to this desperate, poison-drinking plunder.

She looked somewhat flushed and manic, a trace of exhaustion on her face.

"You think I don't know? The Dao Sect wants to use the imperial examination to probe Jade Capital. The ox-nosed priests of Jiannan Dao, the bald donkeys of the Amitabha Temple, and the other sects..."

Her words cut off abruptly.

Hurried footsteps suddenly came from outside the hall. A golden-armored guard stumbled in, his helmet lost somewhere.

"Report! An anomaly in the earth's veins was discovered in the southeast corner of the Imperial Examination Hall. It seems someone has tampered with the earth's veins..."

Six dragon veins converge underground within Jade Capital, corresponding to the six dao of the Great Zhou. They are not to be touched by anyone; this is the foundation of the Great Zhou and the cornerstone of her return to power.

The Empress suddenly burst into laughter, her laughter interspersed with terrifying sounds of coughing up blood.

Her withered face flickered in the shadows of the Golden Throne Hall, like a skeleton wrapped in human skin. "Good... everyone wants to join the fun..."

She shakily stood up. The eyeball gem on her bone staff suddenly widened, and in its pupil映出了 the sky above the Imperial Examination Hall, where a vortex of black and green qi was entwining.

"Pass the decree."

The Empress's voice suddenly became exceptionally clear, each word like a knife etched into bronze. "In one month, I will personally attend the Martial Arts Grand Assembly."

Her hunched back seemed exceptionally small in the pillar of light cast by the hall doors, but her next sentence made everyone feel as if they had fallen into an ice cellar: "Since everyone wants to see how I will die... then let them see clearly."

***

Jade Capital Dao, Hedong Prefecture, on the road to Jade Capital Prefecture.

The Hedong official road in late spring was bathed in warm, golden morning light. Wild apricot blossoms by the roadside were in full bloom, their pink and white petals rustling down onto the bluestone slabs with the wind, only to be crushed into fragrant dust by carriage wheels.

This caravan, flying the banner of "Jiangnan Silk," moved slowly along. Twenty black-canopied carriages were covered with ordinary hemp cloth on the outside, but lined with玄铁 on the inside.

This was a carefully designed decoy caravan by the Dao Sect. Although they could travel very fast by flying high, their purpose this time was not to rush to their target.

Inside the third carriage, Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged, surrounded by ten streams of qi of different colors.

These multicolored qi streams were what he had just refined, marking the complete入门 of the Ten Extremes Martial Way.

Like swimming dragons, these qi streams穿梭ed through his five viscera and six organs. Each one contained a completely different type of martial qi.

In the lung acupoint, with the Three Cycles Sword Cultivation Art as a prerequisite, the sword qi condensed by the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art now formed countless fine threads, refining his alveoli to be as sharp and clear as a sword's edge.

Deep within his heart meridian, the scorching true fire of the Pure Yang One Qi Art burned fiercely, with every heartbeat emitting a roar like that of a forging furnace. At the position of his spleen, the blood qi formed by the Nine曜 Swallowing Qi Art was vigorously催动ed, crushing and purifying the medicinal efficacy from the herbs they passed. Meanwhile, the Jade Marrow Golden Bone power of the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Refining Art acted like a blacksmith's hammer, striking out a sound of clanging metal between his bones and viscera.

The most astonishing change occurred at his liver meridian. The Dragon and Tiger qi from the True Gate's Dragon Tiger Pill Art was actually tearing at the Buddhist Gangsha from the Amitabha Temple. Every collision caused fine cracks to appear on the carriage walls.

Xu Yunfan's mouth渗ed blood, but a hint of joy appeared on his face.

This was precisely the "Ten Extremes Conflict" secret technique taught by Dugu Jiu. It used the mutual generation and restraint of top-level cultivation methods to form a miniature furnace within his viscera.

Practicing the essence of various supreme skills within his body, integrating them for his own use.

Although the Ten Extremes Martial Way was powerful, it required precise control of qi. If not for Xu Yunfan's Attribute Panel, he would not have dared to be so reckless as to send various qi streams into his viscera to begin the process of refining his organs.

"Brother Xu, why is your qi like boiling molten copper?"

Li Haomiao lifted the carriage curtain, bringing in a few willow leaves沾着 morning dew, causing the jade pendant at his waist to sway slightly.

The seemingly ordinary white jade pendant at Li Haomiao's waist actually concealed a hidden mechanism. The surface of the jade faintly showed a five-clawed coiled dragon pattern; it was the unique "Hidden Dragon Seal" of the Great Zhou royal family.

This item could only be worn by the Crown Prince. It contained a trace of true dragon purple qi and was a symbol of imperial authority.

As the only surviving血脉 of the Great Zhou royal family, the Dao Sect had特意 pushed him to the forefront this time. They intended to act under the name of "Quelling Unrest in the Name of Heaven," using the royal family's legitimacy as their banner. This would allow them to rightfully intervene in the chaos of Jade Capital and also intimidate those vassal lords with异心.

Xu Yunfan did not answer. He suddenly pointed two fingers like a sword toward a falling willow leaf.

The leaf strangely split into three in mid-air. The first piece was shredded into dust by sword qi, the second froze as if stuck in a quagmire, and the third actually ignited with a golden flame.

This was a sign of the Ten Extremes Martial Way taking initial form. A single strike contained three layers of force, blending hardness and softness, yin and yang coexisting.

Li Haomiao was startled by this display.
