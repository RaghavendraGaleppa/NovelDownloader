## Chapter 22: Grandmaster's Recommendation, A King's Disciple?

Outside Hengcheng's wilderness, Li Tianhe hurried along, covered in dust from the wind. Just then, a black shadow descended rapidly, crashing heavily into the ground.

Thud!

With a resounding crash, a massive crater was gouged into the earth. This sudden change startled Li Tianhe.

"What's going on?"

Startled, Li Tianhe slowly advanced. Indeed, in the deep pit, he saw a tattered, black-robed figure lying feebly. The figure was covered in wounds, bleeding profusely. A pervasive aura of weakness emanated from them.

Li Tianhe's brows twitched slightly. Just as he was about to step forward, the black-robed figure suddenly opened their eyes. Those were eyes like a wild beast's; a mere glance filled Li Tianhe with terror. Just that one look made Li Tianhe feel as if his entire body had been locked down.

Li Tianhe hastily knelt. "This junior failed to recognize Senior's true form and foolishly advanced; I beg Senior to spare my life!"

This black-robed figure was none other than the Heavenly God Cult's Golden Body expert. Struck by Bai Zhan's full-power attack, he had managed to escape by leveraging that formidable force, but his injuries were extremely severe.

Facing the Jiangnan Province's only openly acknowledged Grandmaster, Su Yu felt a touch of reserve. As if seeing through Su Yu's apprehension, Wang Long waved a hand and said, "No need to be reserved. With your talent, becoming a Grandmaster in the future is only a matter of time. You even have a chance to reach the Conferred King realm, which is beyond Grandmaster."

Beside them, Bai Zhan stared wide-eyed at his Guild Master. One had to know that in Jiangnan Province, their Guild Master was famously impartial. He had never seen anyone elicit such an attitude from him before. However, upon remembering that Su Yu was a Golden Prodigy, Bai Zhan felt relieved. A Golden Prodigy! It was estimated that among the entire human race, only two cities like the Capital and the Demon Capital could produce such a genius. For Jiangnan Province to produce one was practically a sign of immense good fortune, like their ancestral graves smoking.

Su Yu echoed with a smile. Wang Long, smiling, fixed his gaze on Su Yu, rubbed his hands, and spoke with a hint of embarrassment. "Ahem, Su Yu, do you... have a master?"

As soon as these words were uttered, Bai Zhan and the other two were instantly astonished. What did this mean? It meant this old Grandmaster was going to take a disciple!

***

*Perhaps the person he's recommending is even more formidable than him.* *Could it be a Conferred King, a powerhouse beyond the Grandmaster realm?* Instantly, Su Yu felt a surge of anticipation, then quickly said, "With Guild Master's recommendation, this junior would not dare to refuse!"

Wang Long nodded with a smile, then said, "In that case, it's settled. Once you've settled into the Prodigy Camp in a few days, have Bai Zhan bring you to the Jiangnan Province Martial Artist Association. I'll arrange for you to meet him then."

"Thank you, Guild Master!" Su Yu hastily expressed his gratitude.

Wang Long glanced at everyone and said indifferently, "For Hengcheng Martial Artist Association's efforts in resisting the Heavenly God Cult, your resources for next year will be increased by fifty percent!"

Dong Buwei and Liu Kuang were overjoyed. Although it was only fifty percent, it was for an entire year's worth of resources! With these resources, Hengcheng would undoubtedly be able to produce more powerhouses, and perhaps even a Golden Body realm expert!

"Thank you, Grandmaster Wang!" The two quickly expressed their thanks.
