# Chapter 105: The Flowing Cloud Banquet

"Little Mistress, are you still waiting for that big villain?"

"Don't wait anymore! That villain talked so big, but in the end, he couldn't even defeat the talented commoner disciple from Luoxia Sect!"

"Exactly! Completely useless, and so fierce too. Let's not wait for him—we should go back now!"

"Yes, yes! It's all the big villain's fault. If not for him, we would have won!"

Outside the massive black void, an extravagant treasure ship hovered silently.

Bian Chuyao stood on the deck, gazing into the distant dark space, unmoving. Her eyes seemed clouded with confusion.

Several tiny spirits nestled in her hair, whispering words of comfort while continuously cursing Gu Yuan, as if all their failures were his fault.

"Sigh..."

"Senior Brother Deng was right. I've been secluded on Yunxuan Island for too long, relying solely on my family. I thought everything would come easily, but in the end... I still lost."

Bian Chuyao let out a long sigh, deeply dissatisfied with her performance this time.

Before coming here, she had been brimming with confidence, believing everything would go smoothly. Yet reality had proven brutally harsh.

"It's alright, Little Mistress. It's just a defeat in combat. With us by your side, your spiritual roots will only grow stronger. The path of cultivation isn't solely about combat. As long as we cultivate fast enough, we won't even need to fight!"

The little spirits tried to console her.

"True as that may be, without the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit, my foundation establishment will face more obstacles..."

At this thought, Bian Chuyao couldn't help but sigh again—and think of Gu Yuan.

She had already accepted her own defeat. Losing to someone more skilled was simply the way of things.

But... had that villain truly lost to Luoxia Sect's Junior Brother Yun?

Though the sounds of battle from within the mist had been intense, she still harbored doubts.

Having witnessed Gu Yuan's methods firsthand during their journey, she knew he must have engaged in some shady dealings. His bag of tricks was endless, and with his supreme spiritual sense, his foundation was no weaker than that of any elite disciple from a great clan.

Could someone like him really lose to a mere commoner genius from Luoxia Sect who didn't even possess supreme spiritual sense?

She had lingered on the treasure ship, refusing to leave, for two reasons.

First, she wanted to wait for Gu Yuan, hoping he would return safely. After all, she had invited him as reinforcement—she couldn't bear the thought of him dying because of this matter. If that happened, she would never forgive Yanlei Peak!

Second... she wanted to know—had that guy really lost earlier?!

*Plop!*

Just as her thoughts swirled uncertainly, ripples like water waves appeared in the air. A figure materialized from the void, gradually becoming solid.

The man wore a cyan Daoist robe, his black hair like ink, his features handsome.

But now, his face was deathly pale, his robe torn in several places, his aura unstable, and his hair singed—as if he had endured a grueling battle.

"It's the big villain!"

"The big villain is injured!"

The little spirits immediately cried out.

Bian Chuyao's expression also shifted with surprise. She seemed about to voice her concern, but then, as if remembering something, golden light flickered in her eyes as she scrutinized Gu Yuan closely.

Was he... faking it?

She had never been one to assume the worst of others, but after spending just a day with Gu Yuan, she felt her thoughts had grown darker—always suspecting hidden motives behind people's actions.

"Junior Sister Bian!"

"I've fulfilled my duty!"

At that moment, Gu Yuan staggered onto the treasure ship, his weary body barely holding up, and handed Bian Chuyao a jade box.

"This is...?"

Bian Chuyao's heart skipped a beat, her eyes widening in disbelief.

*Snap!*

She eagerly opened the box. Inside lay a golden fruit, glowing softly like flowing golden flames.

"The Flowing Flame Golden Fruit? You actually obtained it?!"

Bian Chuyao stared at Gu Yuan in shock.

Though she had suspected earlier that Gu Yuan might have held back, she had assumed it was because he wanted to prevent her from getting the fruit for some ulterior motive.

Never had she imagined that Gu Yuan could defeat both Senior Brother Deng—who had beaten her—and reclaim the fruit!

In her heart, she had already accepted this venture as a failure. Otherwise, she wouldn't have uttered those harsh words to Senior Brother Deng before leaving Yunlan Valley.

And yet... the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit now lay before her.

This was the key to foundation establishment!

The extension of three hundred years of lifespan!

"How did you do it? Didn't you fail to defeat Junior Brother Yun earlier? How could you have obtained the fruit?"

Bian Chuyao clutched the box tightly while eyeing Gu Yuan with suspicion.

"Defeating Junior Brother Yun wasn't difficult—it just required time... Unfortunately, Junior Sister, you were defeated too quickly. Otherwise, this battle wouldn't have been so arduous. But in the end, I fulfilled my duty."

Gu Yuan barely managed these words before sitting cross-legged on the deck to meditate, saying no more.

His spiritual energy was completely depleted—he needed to recover.

For a moment, silence enveloped the treasure ship.

Bian Chuyao held the jade box containing the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit, her expression complicated as she watched Gu Yuan meditate.

She had never expected Gu Yuan to actually retrieve the fruit for her.

It seemed she had misjudged him with her earlier suspicions.

Though he was detestable, fierce, and underhanded, he was, at his core, someone worth befriending.

With the fruit in hand, the details of how it was obtained no longer mattered to her.

Compared to the fruit, everything else was trivial.

Reflecting on this expedition, her own performance had indeed been lacking. Without Gu Yuan, the rogue cultivators they encountered along the way would have been trouble enough—let alone retrieving the fruit.

Gu Yuan had been the true hero of this journey.

With a soft sigh, she took out a jade slip and placed it before Gu Yuan.

By then, Gu Yuan had recovered somewhat from his meditation. Sensing the movement, he opened his eyes and looked at her curiously.

"Junior Sister, what is this?"

"This jade slip contains the secret manual for cultivating the Azure Lotus Seed. Consider it my token of gratitude."

As she spoke, Bian Chuyao bowed gracefully to Gu Yuan.

"You're too kind, Junior Sister!"

"When entrusted with a task, one must give their all!"

Despite his words, he still pocketed the jade slip.

"The ancient seal technique is quite profound, so I won't impart it to you just yet. Once you've successfully cultivated the lotus seed, I'll visit you with the seal."

Pausing, she hesitated before adding:

"Senior Brother, have you heard of the Flowing Cloud Banquet?"

"The Flowing Cloud Banquet? You mean the Foundation Establishment Spiritual Banquet held by the sect every hundred years?"

Gu Yuan had read about this banquet in the scripture repository. Though called a banquet, it was actually a "competition for spiritual energy."

Every century, the sect would distribute a portion of "heaven and earth spiritual energy" to its disciples to aid in their foundation establishment.

The competition during this banquet was fierce, with all disciples participating. Even the disciples of Golden Core elders had to compete fairly for the energy.

However, the last Flowing Cloud Banquet had been held only thirty years ago.

Why was Bian Chuyao bringing this up now?

Could it be...?

Recalling her earlier words about silencing the gossips, Gu Yuan began to piece things together.

"Indeed. The banquet is set to reopen, and its scale will be grander than before. Times have changed, after all."

"This news won't spread for some time yet, so Senior Brother should prepare early."

At the end, she looked at Gu Yuan and couldn't help but smile. "But I believe with Senior Brother's abilities, even without my reminder, you'd have no trouble..."
