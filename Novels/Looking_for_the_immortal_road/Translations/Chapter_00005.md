# Chapter Five: Talismans

Zhao Di, despite his diligent cultivation, only managed to reach the fourth level of the Qi Condensation stage by the time he was fourteen. Considering he was only a year away from fifteen, reaching the fifth level was an impossibility. Cultivating immortality was inherently defying the heavens; the further one advanced, the more difficult it became, with the challenge increasing exponentially. At his current cultivation speed, even if he could take a Qi Gathering Pill every month, it would still take him at least seven or eight years to reach the fifth level.

Since it was impossible for him to continue cultivating in the Jian family, he simply paused his cultivation and instead prepared for the "expedition" a year later. The Jian family had a place similar to a library called the Scripture Repository, which contained many important events and interesting anecdotes about the cultivation world, collected or personally written by generations of Jian family cultivators. Since he was going out, he naturally needed to understand more about the outside world.

This Scripture Repository was managed by a shriveled, fat middle-aged man. Zhao Di saved two Qi Gathering Pills and bribed him, and in return, the man agreed to let Zhao Di read there for half a month, but no books were allowed to be taken out.

Since cultivating the *Wave-Chasing Art*, Zhao Di had distinctly felt his hearing, vision, and all other senses becoming extraordinarily sharp, and his mind seemed to work better and better. Moreover, as his cultivation continuously advanced, this sensory improvement became more pronounced. After entering the fourth level of Qi Condensation, if he focused all his attention, he could hear a cricket crawling on the mud ground more than twenty meters outside, or see a single strand of hair attached to the grass over ten meters away. As for his brain, he wouldn't dare say he had photographic memory now, but it wasn't far off. It was rumored that most cultivators who reached the sixth level of Qi Condensation or higher could achieve photographic memory.

Therefore, even though the Scripture Repository had over a thousand books, Zhao Di read them very quickly. For each book, he would first skim it, then read it carefully if it contained useful information, or put it back if it was useless or uninteresting. Even so, going through the entire repository in half a month gave Zhao Di a headache; he had overused his brain somewhat.

However, the gains from these two weeks were astonishing. Zhao Di finally gained a general understanding of the outside world, especially the cultivation realm of the Golden Flame Kingdom, and also had a rough direction for his future expeditions. He dared not hope for some stroke of luck, like piles of treasures waiting for him to pick up, the moment he stepped out of the Nanhua Mountain Gorge. To continue cultivating in the immortal world, he had to be able to continuously acquire spiritual elixirs and miraculous medicines that could solidify his foundation and enhance his cultivation. Otherwise, with his aptitude, he would likely not be able to reach the tenth level of Qi Condensation even if he cultivated until he was a hundred years old, while his lifespan would be similar to that of an ordinary mortal. By then, he would have no opportunity to pursue the grand Dao of cultivation.

According to Zhao Di's understanding from the scriptures, there were only two paths to choose from if he wished to continue cultivating:

The first was to seek refuge in a cultivation sect. The Golden Flame Kingdom boasted no less than a thousand large and small cultivation families and sects, but the most powerful among them were the recognized Three Sects, Four Gates, and Seven Great Factions. These seven cultivation behemoths almost monopolized all cultivation resources in the Golden Flame Kingdom, from spiritual herbs and elixirs to various rare mineral deposits. The remaining small and medium-sized forces could only survive by attaching themselves to these seven giants. Some forces were branches of one of the seven great sects, while others paid annual tributes to a major sect, thereby gaining its recognition and protection. Even cultivation families had intricate ties with these seven great factions. Some cultivation families were subordinate to a certain sect, primarily responsible for continuously supplying outstanding cultivation talents to the sect. The ancestors of most cultivation families were also high-level cultivators belonging to these seven great factions; after achieving great merit for their sect, they were permitted to establish their own families. Such cultivation families often maintained good cooperative relationships with a major sect. If a sect encountered danger, considering that "when the lips are gone, the teeth feel cold" (a Chinese idiom meaning mutual dependence), these cultivation families would also step forward to serve the sect.

If one could join a major cultivation sect, they would be assigned certain responsibilities, and upon completing the prescribed tasks, they would enjoy certain benefits, such as elixirs and so on. Everyone understood the principle of "it's good to rest in the shade of a big tree." Therefore, whenever these seven great factions recruited disciples, young cultivators from the Golden Flame Kingdom flocked to them. The disciple slots in the seven great factions became increasingly sought after, and the entry requirements were not low. With Zhao Di's current cultivation of the fourth level of Qi Condensation and his pseudo-spiritual root attribute of five spirit roots, it was simply impossible for any major cultivation sect to be willing to accept him as a disciple; perhaps not even small or medium-sized sects would.

Even if Zhao Di somehow got incredibly lucky and joined a small sect, one must know that the cultivation resources controlled by small sects were extremely limited. They could only use their scarce resources on elite disciples with good aptitudes. How could they possibly spare any for someone like Zhao Di? He would likely end up burdened with many miscellaneous tasks, leaving no time even for cultivation or meditation.

This path was currently impassable for Zhao Di. However, there was another path that Zhao Di might barely have a sliver of a chance with: mastering a special skill to make a living in the cultivation world.

Speaking of special skills, one had to mention the four most sought-after professions in the cultivation world: besides alchemists, who ranked first, there were also artifact refiners, formation masters, and talisman makers. Artifact refiners were masters who forged special magical artifacts that only cultivators could use. Like alchemists, they required strong support from a sect to be cultivated. Without personally having ruined dozens of artifacts and accumulating the necessary experience, it was impossible to become an artifact refiner. Moreover, the materials for refining artifacts were all rare spiritual items; how could an ordinary cultivator have the opportunity to access and refine artifacts so many times?

As for formation masters, besides needing a certain level of accomplishment in artifact refining, they also had to understand many profound principles of formations. Such individuals were even rarer; often, a medium-sized sect would only have one formation master, and smaller sects simply could not possess one.

The last-ranked profession was talisman makers, who created talismans. Talismans were excellent items frequently used by cultivators. To put it simply, creating a talisman involved the talisman maker sealing a certain spell and its spiritual energy onto a talisman paper using special incantations, thereby producing a talisman imbued with the power of that spell. When needing to use this talisman, one only needed to chant a few short incantations and infuse a small amount of spiritual energy into the talisman paper to immediately activate the spell sealed within the talisman, which was much more convenient and faster than casting the spell directly. What's more important, once a talisman was refined, it could be sold or given to other cultivators, and other cultivators could easily use it.

Taking the Fireball Talisman as an example, as the name suggested, it was a talisman that sealed the low-level spell "Fireball Art." The Fourth Elder of the Jian family had once bestowed a Fireball Talisman upon one of his direct descendants, a young girl who was in the same batch as Zhao Di. This little girl had the attributes of Metal, Wood, and Water spirit roots, lacking a Fire spirit root, and thus originally could not cast the "Fireball Art" at all. However, on that occasion, she pulled out a yellow paper slip, about ten centimeters long and five to six centimeters wide, on which was drawn the shape of a flame and strange red runes resembling worms. Then, in front of Zhao Di and a few others, she shook the item forward, and it instantly transformed into a ball of fire, startling Zhao Di and the others who were witnessing a talisman for the first time. Seeing their dumbfounded expressions, the little girl knew her objective had been achieved and triumphantly clapped her hands before leaving. Zhao Di questioned her for a long time afterward before finally understanding that the item with the strange runes was the legendary talisman.

Using talismans wasn't just about convenience and speed; talismans also had various incredible uses, making them, like elixirs, one of the most frequently used items by cultivators. If talismans had drawbacks, they also had two shortcomings.

First, talismans were consumables. Offensive talismans, such as the Fireball Talisman, were one-time use items; once used, they turned into ashes. Auxiliary or defensive talismans could be used more times, but once the sealed spiritual energy within them was exhausted, the talismans would still self-ignite and vanish into ashes. Because of this, among talismans of the same grade, defensive talismans were always slightly more expensive than offensive ones. Since they were consumables that diminished with each use, ordinary cultivators would not easily employ talismans unless it was a critical juncture.

Second, the success rate for crafting talismans was too low. Generally speaking, even for the lowest-grade Qi Condensation stage talismans like the "Fireball Talisman" or "Adamantine Talisman," a novice often had to fail dozens or even hundreds of times consecutively before successfully crafting one. Even a skilled craftsman with thousands of crafting attempts might only have a success rate of around thirty percent. For more advanced talismans, not only were the required talisman paper, cinnabar, talisman brush, and other materials of higher quality, but the success rate would also decrease significantly.
