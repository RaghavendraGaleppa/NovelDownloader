# Chapter 19: Beast Tide Assault (Votes Please!)

The shrill, urgent alarm echoed in Chen Daoxuan's ears.

He instinctively looked up. "Senior, what is this—"

"It's the alarm signaling a beast tide assault on Guang'an Prefecture!" 

The black-robed elder who had been meditating rose to his feet, his voice grave.

"A beast tide attack?"

Hearing this, Chen Daoxuan's expression darkened instantly. The words dredged up unpleasant memories from the depths of his mind.

Years ago, Shuanghu Island's Changping County had suffered a beast tide attack. Both his parents in this life had perished in the jaws of those monsters. Had it not been for his thirteenth uncle Chen Xianhe's timely rescue, his soul would have long departed to the underworld.

Thus, upon hearing of the assault on Guang'an Prefecture, Chen Daoxuan's first reaction wasn't fear—it was seething hatred.

Noticing his agitation, the elder seemed to mistake it for fear and reassured him, "Don't worry. Beast tide attacks on Guang'an Prefecture aren't uncommon. You'll get used to it."

This response puzzled Chen Daoxuan. "Senior, how can that be? Isn't Guang'an Prefecture the Zhou Clan's territory? With their power, how could they be troubled by beast tides?"

The elder pointed at the Water Spirit Pearl in Chen Daoxuan's hand. "Young friend, have you heard of the Merfolk?"

The question triggered a memory from one of his clan's ancient texts: 

*"In the southern seas dwell the Merfolk, abiding in the deep. Their voices ensnare minds, they excel at cultivating spirit pearls, and they command sea beasts with mastery."* 

He had always treated such records as mere legends—until now.

"I've read about them in ancient texts," Chen Daoxuan replied. "But what does that have to do with the beast tides? Is it related to this Water Spirit Pearl?" 

Seeing the elder gesture toward the pearl, a suspicion formed in his mind.

"Your guess is correct," the elder nodded. "It's precisely because of these pearls. Spirit Pearl Island is the Zhou Clan's largest pearl cultivation site in Guang'an Prefecture. But to cultivate spirit pearls, they must capture female Merfolk. Every year, the Zhou Clan's hunting fleets scour nearby waters for them. It seems they've angered another Merfolk tribe this year."

A hint of schadenfreude tinged the elder's voice. 

As a loose cultivator, he naturally harbored resentment toward major cultivation clans—not out of personal dislike, but because these clans monopolized too many cultivation resources, creating deep-seated conflicts. Had the Qian Yuan Sword Sect not redirected this tension by attacking the Cloud-Soaring Kingdom, the Starry Sea might have already descended into chaos.

Chen Daoxuan had no time for gloating. His thoughts immediately flew to the Canglong, his clan's cargo ship, still docked at Guang'an's harbor. If the beasts were coming from the sea, wouldn't their vessel be the first to suffer?

"Senior, I must take my leave," he said hurriedly. "Our ship is still at the port. Thank you for your earlier assistance."

At the mention of ships, the elder slapped his thigh. "Damn it! My ship's there too!"

His panic was understandable—his vessel, commissioned from the Yang Clan at great expense, was a magical treasure ship worth over eight hundred spirit stones. Far more valuable than the Chen Clan's humble cargo vessel.

Without another word, the elder swiftly packed his stall into a storage pouch, cast a Wind Riding spell, and soared toward the outer city. 

He wasn't alone. Countless other cultivators took to the skies as Guang'an's anti-flight formations deactivated in response to the emergency.

For Chen Daoxuan, it was the most spectacular sight he'd witnessed in this life—tens of thousands of cultivators darkening the skies as they flew toward the harbor.

With no time to marvel, he joined the exodus.

By the time he located the Canglong, Thirteenth Uncle Chen Xianhe already stood on its deck.

"Thirteenth Uncle!" 

Chen Daoxuan descended and bowed respectfully.

"Mm." 

Chen Xianhe nodded approvingly at his nephew before turning a solemn gaze toward the black mass of beasts gathering on the horizon. "The Merfolk tribe the Zhou Clan provoked this time must be substantial."

A glance at the sea reassured Chen Daoxuan. 

After days in Guang'an, he understood the Zhou Clan's terrifying strength. Though the beast horde seemed vast, closer inspection revealed they were all low-level, unranked creatures. Even Guang'an's loose cultivators could easily annihilate them—their numbers and individual prowess far outstripped the beasts.

Noticing his nephew's confidence, Chen Xianhe cautioned, "With so many beasts, the Zhou cultivators won't stop them all. If any break through, don't charge ahead recklessly—just protect our ship."

He wasn't worried about the beasts harming Chen Daoxuan, whose skills easily surpassed these low-level monsters. But youthful impetuosity might drive him into the thick of battle, where depleted energy could prove fatal even against weak foes.

As cultivators continued arriving, the two forces formed opposing lines along Guang'an's coastline.

Surveying the endless sea of cultivators before them, uncle and nephew relaxed. 

Their ship's inner docking position, shielded by rows of other vessels, provided natural protection. Those stuck at the front cursed inwardly but had no choice—their own ships demanded defense.

Naturally, the Zhou Clan's cultivators formed the vanguard. 

Guang'an was their territory, and this disaster was of their making. They bore full responsibility for its defense.

In the lull, Chen Xianhe quipped, "The Yang Clan must be laughing all the way to the bank."

At Chen Daoxuan's puzzled look, he explained, "The Yangs are the region's premier shipbuilders, second only to the Zhou Clan in status. Our Canglong came from their docks. With so many ships likely destroyed today, their business will boom."

No sooner had he spoken than a piercing shriek split the sky.

"SCREEEEE—!"

The sound hammered Chen Daoxuan's eardrums, sending his heart racing and stomach churning. He quickly circulated qi to suppress the nausea. 

Glancing at Chen Xianhe, he saw his uncle equally pale-faced.

"That's... a high-rank Merfolk!" 

Chen Xianhe's voice turned icy. "Just what calamity have the Zhous brought upon us this time?"
