# Chapter 42: Unity of Heaven and Man – The Realm of Selflessness  

Seeing Li Wanqing's satisfaction, Wei Qian quietly exhaled in relief.  

*"Phew, pretending to lack talent isn't easy,"* he thought to himself.  

At his current level, refining Qi-Replenishing Pills would yield premium-grade results every time. But if he displayed such talent, not only would Li Wanqing be astonished, even the two Foundation Establishment ancestors of the Li family would be immediately alerted.  

Thus, during the alchemy process, he had no choice but to deliberately sabotage himself at critical moments, barely managing to feign the appearance of a novice alchemist.  

Even so, Li Wanqing was thoroughly pleased.  

"What is your current monthly stipend?"  

"Three low-grade spirit stones."  

"Raise it! Increase it to five low-grade spirit stones per month."  

Li Wanqing declared without hesitation. As the family head, he had the authority to do so.  

"Hmm, I recall you get along well with Gu Chen?" Li Wanqing asked again.  

"Yes. Gu Chen is very amiable, carrying himself with the grace of a noble scion."  

Praising a man's son to his face was a tactic few men could resist—Li Wanqing was no exception.  

He laughed heartily. "You youngsters always have more to talk about among yourselves than with us old folks."  

"Here’s a token for you. From now on, you may cultivate in the first-grade high-tier spirit vein on this mountain."  

The Mist Ridge Mountain naturally had even better spiritual lands. Wei Qian knew that at the summit, there was a spirit spring. The spiritual energy there was so dense it rivaled a second-grade low-tier spirit vein—it was where the Li family’s two Foundation Establishment ancestors usually cultivated.  

Even Li Wanqing wasn’t qualified to stay there long.  

Thus, the treatment Li Wanqing offered Wei Qian was already quite generous.  

But that wasn’t all.  

Next, Li Wanqing took out a blank jade slip, pressed it to his forehead, imprinted some content onto it, and handed it to Wei Qian.  

"This contains two pill formulas—one for a detoxification pill and another for a Spirit-Gathering Pill that enhances cultivation."  

"At the end of the formulas are my annotations. Study them first, and if you have any questions, come ask me."  

"You may collect ten portions of detoxification pill ingredients and five portions of Spirit-Gathering Pill ingredients from Elder Wanhai for free. After that, you’ll need to purchase the ingredients yourself."  

Taking the jade slip, Wei Qian felt a surge of joy.  

He had just obtained two pill formulas for free, along with a batch of complimentary alchemy ingredients.  

*"The Li family’s traditions are truly commendable. I definitely made the right choice coming here."* Once again, Wei Qian rejoiced at his decision years ago.  

---  

Among all the benefits Li Wanqing had granted, the one Wei Qian valued most was the token allowing him to cultivate in a first-grade high-tier spirit vein.  

As a former rogue cultivator, he had always yearned for an environment rich in spiritual energy!  

The next day, after completing his daily tenant duties—tending to the spirit peach trees—Wei Qian made his way up the mountain.  

The peak of Mist Ridge Mountain remained largely undeveloped, with most areas retaining their natural state.  

Wei Qian summoned his *Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword* and cleared a spacious area on a large rock.  

After purifying the surface with a fireball spell, he leaped onto the rock.  

Taking a deep breath, he immediately sensed the spiritual energy here was far denser than at his residence.  

*"Three months. Even without pills, I’m confident I can reach the peak of the fifth layer of Qi Refining within three months."*  

Another three months, and he could attempt to break through to the sixth layer.  

But with the aid of pills, Wei Qian believed he could reach the sixth layer by the end of the year.  

*"A twenty-six-year-old at the sixth layer of Qi Refining—even in a sect, that wouldn’t be considered poor."*  

Of course, prodigies who reached Qi Refining perfection before thirty—or even attempted Foundation Establishment—were not unheard of, but they were exceedingly rare.  

Even in a vast immortal cultivation nation like Zhao, spanning millions of miles, such talents likely numbered fewer than the fingers on one hand.  

*"Wait, such geniuses are indeed scarce, but there’s actually one in the Yunzhou region."*  

Wei Qian suddenly recalled an event from thirteen years ago, when the Golden Core-level sect *"Flowing Cloud Sect"* opened its doors to recruit disciples. Among the candidates, they discovered a prodigy with *Earth-grade spiritual roots*!  

At the time, the prodigy was only twelve. Now, at twenty-five, they were a year younger than Wei Qian.  

*"But their cultivation must be far ahead of mine—they’ve probably long since reached the late stages of Qi Refining."*  

The Flowing Cloud Sect had kept the prodigy tightly guarded, revealing no information to outsiders since their recruitment.  

Wei Qian understood this well.  

Spiritual roots were classified into five tiers: Low-grade, Mid-grade, High-grade, Earth-grade, and Heaven-grade!  

An Earth-grade spiritual root meant no bottleneck in Foundation Establishment and a natural 60% success rate in forming a Golden Core—one that would almost certainly be a high-quality core!  

Moreover, such individuals had the potential to reach Golden Core Perfection and even attempt Nascent Soul!  

As for Heaven-grade spiritual roots—that was on another level entirely.  

Just the fact that they faced no bottlenecks in Foundation Establishment or Golden Core formation was enough to make millions of cultivators green with envy!  

As long as no accidents occurred, a Heaven-grade cultivator could smoothly advance all the way to Golden Core Perfection through sheer cultivation.  

Zhao’s Nascent Soul-level sect, *"Ten Thousand Stars Gate,"* even had a special rule: any disciple found to possess Heaven-grade spiritual roots would immediately be promoted to *True Inheritance* status, treated as a *"Nascent Soul Seed."*  

*"If I had Heaven-grade spiritual roots, I’d probably already be in Foundation Establishment by now."* Even Wei Qian couldn’t help but fantasize about how different his life would be in that scenario.  

However, this fleeting moment of envy was swiftly crushed by his resolve.  

*"I possess the* **Wishing Dragon Pearl**—*my future achievements won’t be inferior to those Earth or Heaven-grade prodigies."*  

*"As the saying goes, speed alone doesn’t guarantee victory—what matters is not stumbling along the way."*  

Wei Qian’s gaze grew resolute.  

The path of cultivation would never be smooth sailing; challenges and obstacles were inevitable. But with the power of the Dragon Pearl, he could level every mountain blocking his path and fill every pitfall on his journey!  

Sitting cross-legged on the massive rock, Wei Qian took a deep breath and calmed his mind completely.  

*"Heart like still water."*  

In the next moment, the surrounding spiritual energy stirred, drawn into his body and absorbed into his dantian. After multiple cycles, it transformed into pure spiritual power.  

One quarter-hour passed, then two, then three...  

At first, the occasional Li family cultivator passing by would notice Wei Qian meditating atop the rock.  

But as time wore on, Wei Qian seemed to merge entirely with his surroundings—as if his seated figure had always been a natural part of the landscape.  

At a glance, no one would detect anything unusual.  

Wei Qian had achieved perfect harmony with heaven and earth, entering the *"Unity of Heaven and Man"*—the elusive *Realm of Selflessness*.  

This was a state countless cultivators yearned for but rarely attained. Even Foundation Establishment experts and Golden Core masters couldn’t claim to enter it frequently.  

Yet here was Wei Qian, a mere fifth-layer Qi Refining cultivator, accomplishing it effortlessly.  

*"Hmm? What’s that?"*  

A young woman in a green dress descended the mountain. As she passed the rock, she sensed something peculiar.  

Pausing, she scrutinized the area for three breaths before finally pinpointing the source of her unease.
