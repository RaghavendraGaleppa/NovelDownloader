Chapter 405: Another Black Year Beast (1/2)

In a certain underground palace, dozens of tomb guardians of various appearances surged in the darkness. The smallest among them was larger than an adult man. As they approached the firelight, their forms became clear.

They were Human-faced Bats.

*Whoosh!*

A sharp sword swept through, cleaving one effortlessly in two. The firelight illuminated the blade in the dark chamber.

Dozens of sword lights crisscrossed. The disciples of the Hengyun Sword City were controlling the White Flow Sword Formation to resist the ferocious creatures attacking from all sides.

The formation seemed unshakable, but in reality, almost every swordsman was injured.

"This is definitely not a place of inheritance," Bai Jinghong said, his chest bleeding and his face pale.

"Xiao Bai, you should enter the formation to meditate. You've been poisoned," Cao Mu said in a deep voice.

Suddenly, the corner of his eye twitched. A black shadow approached from above. He leaped up like a dragon rising from dry land and slammed into it.

It was a four-winged bat that had cunningly dodged the sword light and returned to the shadows to spy.

"Watch out for the sky!" Cao Mu roared.

Everyone immediately became serious. These tomb guardians were chaotic and erratic. Individually, they weren't strong, but their methods were strange, and they were extremely cunning.

The Three Heroes of Hengyun exchanged glances and took a deep breath. They had been separated from the elders for no apparent reason upon entering and had immediately encountered these tomb guardians.

Originally, they had planned to hold their ground here and wait for the elders to find them, but it seemed that plan wouldn't work. They would likely be worn down to death before the elders arrived.

"We must kill that Bat King," one said.

"Only Xiao Bai can injure it."

"We have to wait for an opportunity..."

This was a combined sword technique they had领悟ed after listening to Ying Bing's lectures back in the sword city. The three of them silently adjusted their breathing and activated their sword mantras.

Suddenly, Cao Mu, who had the sharpest ears, shouted a warning.

Instantly after his warning, Bai Jinghong was enveloped by a sword qi resembling a long river and soared into the sky, reaching the black shadow above in the blink of an eye.

The massive Human-faced Bat King seemed to sense it, letting out a sound wave that made one's head split in pain, before trying to retreat into the darkness once more.

But Bai Jinghong's speed was even faster, following closely and driving his sword upward.

Then, sword lights flickered in the darkness, accompanied by the flapping of wings and increasingly shrill death cries.

Dozens of seconds passed.

*Bang!*

The two halves of the corpse fell heavily to the ground. The tide-like black shadows finally scattered like headless flies.

"Xiao Bai!"

"Senior Brother!"

Bai Jinghong's face was now completely green, his breath extremely weak. He almost stumbled and fell upon landing.

"I'm fine. It will take some time, but the poison isn't a big problem."

Everyone finally breathed a sigh of relief. At least the immediate crisis was resolved. Once the elders arrived, everything would be solved...

"Don't let your guard down," Wu Chushu said, stuffing a handful of antidote pills into Bai Jinghong's mouth and reminding everyone. "Who knows what else might come..."

*Thud.*

Before he could finish, a tremor came from ahead, causing the stones on the ground to jump. It sounded like footsteps, but they were too heavy...

Cao Mu's expression changed drastically, sweat dripping from his forehead.

"Something is coming... straight for us."

"Those things earlier couldn't just have been the appetizer, right?" Wu Chushu said, then immediately slapped himself in the mouth.

"!!"

Everyone's faces turned pale, and their breathing became unconsciously lighter.

*Can't Senior Brother Wu just keep his mouth shut?!*

*He's so damn accurate!*

A swordsman, mustering his courage, threw his light source forward, dispelling the darkness ahead.

It finally allowed the giant shadow's outline to gradually become clear.

The shadow was several times larger than the previous tomb guardians, almost comparable to the Black Year Beast they had encountered before. It wasn't just the size; the species was almost identical.

This was another Black Year Beast. It looked at the crowd with a seemingly human-like...

Mockery?

Those disaster beasts from earlier had been released by it. Among the group, only Bai Jinghong could injure it, and now Bai Jinghong had almost lost his fighting capability.

"Damn it, let's fight it to the death!"

"It's just the peak of the Fourth Realm... we might as well go down together!"

Wu Chushu tore his clothes and tied his sword to his hand.

Cao Mu looked at him silently. *If we survive this, I have to find a chance to poison Wu Chushu mute...*

*Whoosh—*

A foul wind brushed against their faces. The Black Year Beast had no intention of playing with its prey; it just wanted to swallow these blood sacrifices into its stomach as soon as possible.

The swordsmen were about to fight with their lives on the line when a familiar voice suddenly rang out in the empty underground palace:

"Get out of the way!"

The familiar voice made them subconsciously do as they were told.

The next second, a chill came from the darkness behind them, followed by a brilliant and cold sword light blooming.

*Jinghong Zhao Ying* pierced through the void. The sword in her hand was so fast it was hard to catch with the naked eye.

*Splat—*

The sword light pierced the Black Year Beast's chest. Ice crystals spread from the wound, as if it would freeze completely in an instant.

The Black Year Beast looked at the cold, clear少女 holding the sword in shock. It actually spoke in a human tongue:

"You... didn't die?"

It suddenly went berserk, ignoring the Hengyun Sword City disciples entirely and turning into a black shadow charging straight at the少女.

At that exact moment, several True Words fell from the void, freezing its body for a split second.

A man followed closely behind the少女, raising the hammer in his hand. Fierce, karmic fire spread in a rolling torrent as he slammed it down with immense force.

*Bang!*

A dull sound echoed as it was smashed to the ground. However, the figure gave the Black Year Beast no time to catch its breath, pouncing down.

*Bang, bang, bang—*

Every strike shook the underground palace.

"Mother of..." Wu Chushu swallowed hard.

"It's them," Cao Mu said, finally truly relaxing.

Bai Jinghong also let out a sigh of relief.

Gradually, the pounding stopped. That Year Beast had probably been hammered into a paste.

"Truly worthy of being a G..."

"Huh?"

"Ahem, truly worthy of being Li Sword Immortal!"

Wu Chushu glanced at the blood-stained hammer, his eyelids twitching, and changed his words with a sense of违心.

"Thank you, Li Sword Immortal, for saving our lives."

The swordsmen, caring little for their pride now, praised Li Mo's swordsmanship endlessly with a stream of flattery.

"What a coincidence, running into you in the underground palace."

"Well, not exactly a coincidence."

Li Mo had deliberately taken a detour for this, even forgoing the optimal solution for the chess game.

At this moment, the system notification rang out:

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Wu Chushu' and preventing his death.】

【You have an investment feedback waiting to be claimed.】

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Bai Jinghong' and preventing his death.】

【You have an investment feedback waiting to be claimed.】

...

Fortunately, the people were saved, and there was some辛苦费 (hardship pay).
