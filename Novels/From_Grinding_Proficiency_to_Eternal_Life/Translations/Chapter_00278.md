# Chapter 278: Angel Investor

The vertebrae in his spine cracked like thunder rolling through his body. The Scarlet Flood Coiling Mountain Strength surged from his tailbone, spiraling upward along his spine like a great dragon.

Every inch of his muscles and bones felt like red-hot steel springs, layering and compressing immense force.

Where the mace tip passed, the air was torn into visible ripples of distortion. Mountain winds and mist condensed into spiral air currents that wrapped around the mace shaft.

Morning dew on distant pine branches trembled and fell, as if the entire mountain peak was shivering in the low hum of this fierce weapon.

*'Your Nine Xuan Kanglong Mace Technique has reached perfection...'*

Glancing at the prompt that appeared in his vision, Xu Yunfan finally sighed helplessly and put away the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace in his hand.

After the Nine Xuan Kanglong Mace Technique reached perfection, there was nothing further to advance; not a single point of proficiency would grow.

Xu Yunfan's mind once again floated back to the information Bi Yuan had told him three days ago.

Bi Yuan wouldn't lie to him about this matter; in fact, it was even more serious than what the other party had said.

He had wanted to ask Yu Congling in his dreams, but found that she had completely fallen silent. No matter how he called out to her, even sleeping for an entire day, there was no response. It seemed that what she said at the White Jade Palace had completely exhausted the power she had accumulated for so long.

"Heavenly Demon..."

Xu Yunfan touched the Dao Sect token hanging on his robe.

This Tongxuan Token was personally given to him by Bi Yuan. It was carved entirely from mysterious jade, with the Dao Sect's Nine Luminaries star patterns inlaid within.

Whoever holds this token can freely enter and exit all thirty-six peaks and seventy-two halls of the Dao Sect, except for a few forbidden areas. In particular, the Langhuan Library Tower, which is known to "contain all the martial arts in the world," even the top floor, which is said to hold all the world's divine skills and peerless arts, is accessible without restriction.

The Dao Sect has stood for thousands of years, surviving seven great calamities of heaven and earth without falling. Its library tower contains volumes as vast as the sea.

It has the true original copy of the "Twelve Techniques of Golden Pass and Jade Lock" left by the sect's true transmission, the unique annotated copies of the "Taiyi Sword Sutra" by past masters, and even fragments of the long-lost "Huangting Secret Record."

Such treatment has been enjoyed by only three people since the founding of the Dao Sect.

If Bi Yuan had not reached the peak of the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining and suppressed the various elders within the sect with supreme authority, this Tongxuan Token, which symbolizes the sect master's personal presence, would never have fallen into the hands of a non-sect disciple.

Such boldness, such sincerity—even Xu Yunfan couldn't help but be moved. By the time he came to his senses, he was already tightly gripping the token and wouldn't let go.

Who could refuse this?

Although the Dao Sect's intentions were obvious, no one could refuse. This was truly an angel investor.

Xu Yunfan was just about to head to the Langhuan Library Tower when he suddenly saw the mountain path's clouds and mist churning. The Taoist boy who had guided him before hurried over, the star patterns on the cuffs of his blue robe fluttering like butterflies with his movements.

The Taoist boy bowed from ten paces away, his voice clear and bright like striking jade: "Senior Brother Xu, Master Zhan Yan has arrived at the mountain gate. He is currently in the Guest Hall with the Sect Master enjoying tea. The Sect Master orders you to go see him immediately."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan's brow slightly furrowed. The fine scales inside his dragon scale armor moved without wind. His master had arrived so quickly? He must have been rushing over day and night.

He immediately nodded: "Please lead the way."

The Taoist boy led him southeast, onto a suspended stone path hidden in the sea of clouds.

Each blue stone slab was inscribed with cloud patterns. When his steps fell, due to the extraordinary material of the cloud patterns, they actually emitted a faint silver glow. It was truly luxurious and grand.

From time to time, clear and melodious bell sounds came from the clouds on both sides. Looking closely, one would find it was the sound of black birds perched on iron pines pecking wind chimes.

Passing a rainbow bridge spanning two peaks, Xu Yunfan suddenly stopped. In the abyss below the bridge, dozens of rust-stained ancient swords actually floated and sank. The sword qi made the green sword scabbard he had obtained from Su Henhe at his waist hum and tremble.

"That is 'Sword Burial Abyss'."

Seeing him staring, the Taoist boy explained softly: "Before passing away, every Dao Sect disciple would throw their sword into this place. There is a divine weapon lurking within."

Before his words fell, a crimson sword light suddenly shot up from the bottom of the abyss, tearing a blood-colored crack in the clouds before falling back into the depths.

The Taoist boy's expression remained unchanged: "It seems another senior has passed away today."

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrow at this but said nothing.

The Dao Sect has nearly three hundred thousand disciples in total, thirty thousand inner sect disciples, several thousand true transmission disciples, not to mention the various elders. Over the years, the numbers are staggering.

The Jiannan Dao has twelve states in total. Aside from some minor sects and martial arts schools, and some ordinary sects, almost all of them support this behemoth.

The outline of the Guest Hall finally appeared as the clouds parted.

The entire building was constructed with bronze as its frame and glazed tiles as its roof.

Seven dragon-winding pillars stood on the square in front of the hall. At this moment, the copper chains wrapped around the pillars were moving without wind, making crisp sounds of metal striking metal.

Still a hundred steps from the hall entrance, Xu Yunfan's ears were already struck by the familiar thunderous laughter, carrying a hint of flattery that even the speaker might not have realized.

"Hahaha! Sect Master Bi, your 'Cold Marrow Mist Buds' compared to the 'Molten Heart Iron Tea' I planted in the Heavenly Work Cave... it's like a young lady's embroidery needle meeting a forging hammer! Truly wonderful, it feels like touching a few delicate young ladies..."

The sound waves made the jade tiles on the square floor tremble slightly. When several black birds startled and flew, their feathers actually sparked in the air.

"..."

Xu Yunfan's lips couldn't help but curve upward.

This rough and bold voice was the unique trademark of Zhan Yan, the head of the Casting Hall in the Heavenly Work Cave.

He quickened his steps, but as he crossed the threshold, he saw his master Zhan Yan sitting boldly in front of the table, his expression carrying a hint of restraint.

But his actions and words were still rough.

Xu Yunfan was speechless, but didn't think there was anything wrong with it.

The host above was the Dao Sect Sect Master, a peerless powerhouse at the peak of the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining. Anyone would be shaken in their heart.

"Yunfan!"

Seeing Xu Yunfan enter, Zhan Yan turned to look at his unharmed appearance, his expression relaxed, and he finally put his mind at ease. He quickly stepped forward and looked Xu Yunfan up and down.

"Master!"

Xu Yunfan cupped his fists with deep sincerity.

Looking at Xu Yunfan's joyful expression, Zhan Yan had a thousand words in his chest, but in the end, he just patted Xu Yunfan's shoulder and turned it into a single sentence.

"It's good that you're safe."

Bi Yuan, sitting in the main seat, watched this scene and couldn't help but sigh in his heart. He knew that Xu Yunfan's sincere intention to take Zhan Yan as his master wasn't mixed with any external matters at all.

After dismissing that trace of thought in his heart, Bi Yuan smiled: "Daoist Zhan, having such a disciple is truly heaven's blessing."

Hearing Bi Yuan's unreserved praise, Zhan Yan immediately beamed with joy. He was about to boast a few words out of habit, but then remembered who was sitting beside him.

"Where, where. The master leads through the gate, but cultivation depends on the individual. My disciple spends most of his time fighting outside. My Heavenly Work Cave can only provide logistical support."

Bi Yuan smiled and nodded, his fingertips lightly tapping the tea cup. Ripples of spiritual energy immediately appeared in the cup on the green jade table: "Daoist Zhan, do you know that Young Friend Yunfan has already reached the Marrow Cleansing realm?"

"What?!"

Zhan Yan suddenly stood up. His right arm, forged from meteoric iron, pressed a spiderweb of cracks into the cold jade table.

His single eye burst with red firelight, his steel-like beard standing up like needles. Just a few months ago when they parted, this brat was still diligently practicing in the Muscle Refining realm!
