# Chapter 168: Secret View of the Spirit Well

In the pavilion, Lin Shan and his twenty-odd subordinates were gathered together in secret discussion.

Lin Shan laid out the plan: "This is the situation. The Gongsun family has a great opportunity this time. I'll be going underground to cultivate for several months to half a year. You'll stay here temporarily during my absence."

His subordinates, however, showed visible concern. Without Lin Shan—their Foundation Establishment-level protector—they felt insecure everywhere. Yet they dared not stop their envoy from pursuing this benefit.

Old Zhong voiced everyone's worry: "Sir, the battle at Luosong Mountain frontline is raging. Half a year is too unpredictable. If something unexpected happens while you're deep underground..."

Lin Shan frowned at the reminder. He had considered this issue. It was uncertain whether the three demonic sects could hold out for another six months, as the current situation eerily mirrored that of a decade ago.

The demonic faction now resembled the righteous faction back then, with only the offensive and defensive positions reversed. Without external intervention, once the Zixiao Sect regained strength, prolonged defense would likely fail. Both sides were probably awaiting reinforcements now.

Back then, the demonic faction had broken through Luosong Mountain in half a month. Who knew how long the righteous faction's current offensive would take? Meanwhile, Lin Shan would be isolated underground for half a year, during which the outside world could change drastically.

If the righteous army broke through and reached the Gongsun family in Shangdang Prefecture, he might be trapped like a turtle in a jar—either perishing with the Gongsuns or being handed over as a surrender offering.

But these were just conjectures. Currently, the demonic frontline seemed stable, and the Gongsun family appeared reliable according to Protector Yan. Returning to the more dangerous frontline now would be worse than staying put until the situation clarified.

Still, caution was necessary. "If major trouble arises and the Gongsun family tries to trap us as bargaining chips while playing both sides, we must have an exit strategy," Lin Shan said.

His subordinates proposed countermeasures:

"If trouble comes, we must first guard against the Gongsun family's protective formation."

"Their formation consumes massive spiritual energy. Since their spirit vein powers cultivation, the formation stays inactive except in emergencies. We could secretly tamper with its foundations."

"We should also familiarize ourselves with the perimeter illusion arrays, noting exit points and patterns."

"Get close to lower-ranking Gongsun members to monitor their activities."

"Maintain contact with the frontline for timely alerts."

The group brainstormed numerous strategies. Though not highly skilled, they were resourceful.

"I'll enter the Gongsun spirit vein in three days. Implement these plans while I'm gone," Lin Shan instructed. Having subordinates was proving useful—they could strategize and act where he couldn't.

The rare spirit tide opportunity was crucial, especially the "Heaven and Earth Nectar" for enhancing spiritual roots—vital for saving time and resources in later cultivation stages.

Currently, the Gongsun family showed no hostile intent, still hosting them respectfully. Their Golden Core ancestor remained secluded, unlikely to notice Lin Shan, whose current abilities could likely handle the Gongsuns if needed.

For now, they seemed safe. As a demonic envoy, the Gongsuns would likely curry favor to avoid conscription. The real threat was righteous cultivator infiltration.

Recalling recent battles where righteous cultivators had infiltrated demonic territory to sow discord, Lin Shan deemed the risk manageable unless the frontline collapsed entirely. The Gongsuns wouldn't dare act against him without that.

Being assigned here was Protector Yan's arranged retreat—far safer than the frontline.

After discussion, Old Zhong volunteered: "Sir, we'll prepare contingencies while you cultivate. We'll provide support aboveground."

Lin Shan agreed. "Old Zhong will lead. Gather intelligence discreetly. For tampering with their formation, the Black Skeleton Monarch will assist you."

He handed the skeleton artifact to Old Zhong. As a formation master, the skeleton could help bypass the Gongsun's protective array if needed during Lin Shan's return. The subordinates, experienced former East Sea rogue cultivators, were reliable.

The next day, Lin Shan found several Gongsun Foundation Establishment cultivators "playing chess" near his pavilion, seemingly keeping watch under the guise of hospitality.

As his men left to explore, Gongsun members intercepted them, claiming certain areas were restricted due to renovations, ancestral tombs, or dangerous spirit beasts—a plausible excuse to monitor their movements.

Unaware this actually concealed righteous faction activities, Lin Shan accepted the explanation gracefully.

For two days, he stayed put playing chess while his men gathered intel. They reported one-third of Gongsun Qi Condensation cultivators had vanished, likely deployed on some secret project.

That night, Lin Shan held final instructions: "I enter the spirit vein tomorrow for months. Follow our plans." The Black Skeleton Monarch provided a one-time communication conch for emergencies.

The next day, escorted deep into Gongsun territory, Lin Shan met four young Foundation Establishment Gongsun cultivators—his fellow spirit vein entrants.

Elder Gongsun Lu greeted him. Among the youths, Lin Shan recognized Gongsun Yu from an encounter twelve years prior in Yichuan. Though Gongsun Yu didn't recall the lowly Qi Condensation rogue cultivator Lin Shan had been, he politely acknowledged the now-respected demonic envoy.

Elder Gongsun grew concerned—their secret dealings with the righteous faction couldn't afford complications from this old acquaintance.

The group descended twenty miles underground through a winding, spirit-rich tunnel to a bronze-pillared hall guarded by stone rhino constructs. Five portals appeared, each leading to a spirit well chamber.

After the five entered, the portals vanished. Elder Gongsun activated the hall's defensive formations before leaving.

---

In the clan hall, Gongsun elders discussed their plans with the veiled "Lady Qi" of the righteous faction. They'd trapped Lin Shan underground—not harming him (which might alert the Black Lotus Sect) but preventing interference.

"The righteous offensive begins in two months. We'll declare allegiance once the tide turns," Elder Gongsun said. "His subordinates are monitored. Afterwards, they'll be our surrender offering."

The elders then boasted about their spirit tide preparations, confident their prearranged treasures would outperform Lin Shan's efforts.

Meanwhile, deep underground, Lin Shan sat before a misty spirit well, peering at the colossal spirit vein's fragmentary form below—a white dragon of surging energy. Calming himself, he took out his innate spiritual treasure.
