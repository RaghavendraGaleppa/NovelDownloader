# Chapter 283: The Desires of the Body

Xu Yunfan’s heart skipped a beat. He quickly suppressed the fire rising from his lower abdomen and said calmly, "Thank you for your kindness, Senior Sisters. Yunfan appreciates the offer, but I have urgent matters to attend to at the moment. I must take my leave."

Before Qingluan and Shaoyao could say anything, he took a step out of the courtyard and quickly departed, carrying the severely damaged Thunderfire Qilin Hammer.

Shaoyao said with some regret, "What a pity. If we could get close to this Senior Brother Xu, the two of us wouldn't have to work so hard."

Qingluan didn't speak. She just stared blankly in the direction Xu Yunfan left, her eyes unblinking.

Beside them, the sound of Qing Song's playful laughter came. "Senior Sister Shaoyao has quite the plan. If I were a woman, I would definitely throw myself at Senior Brother Xu. Unlike you two. If it weren't for the Sect Master’s personal permission, who would dare let you perform the Nine Revolutions Palace Pushing Hand?"

Shaoyao scolded playfully, "You little rascal. You're not old, but you speak with the air of an old man."

Looking at Shaoyao's alluring and coquettish expression, Qing Song shuddered and instinctively hunched over.

"Senior Sister, I have matters to attend to. As the Sect Master's attendant, I can't stay away for too long..."

"..."

"Two little temptresses!"

Xu Yunfan exhaled. The graceful figures of Qingluan and Shaoyao, every frown and smile, still lingered in his mind.

He frowned slightly and formed the Seal of Lin with one hand in front of his chest. He silently recited the "Supreme Goodness is Like Water" Heart Mantra twice, completely severing the emotions conveyed by his body's instincts.

He didn't know what the intention was behind letting these two in.

In martial arts cultivation, a warrior's physique is robust, and their blood energy is vigorous. As a result, various instinctual desires are infinitely amplified.

After the flesh, muscles, and bones are tempered a thousand times, every drop of blood boils like molten rock, and the breathing of the organs is like the rolling of wind and thunder.

Such a powerful physique brings not only strength but also a hundredfold expansion of desires for food and sex, the thought of slaughter, and the heart of competition. When hungry, one could devour tigers and leopards; when angry, one wants to crush mountains and split seas. Even the act of breathing can cause the surrounding air to swirl violently.

Without the restraint of a martial arts mindset, a warrior is like an out-of-control weapon.

Xu Yunfan had seen many warriors who were devoured by their own strength, becoming slaves to their bodily desires, soaking in brothels all day without moving a step.

This appearance is all because they failed to control strength with their mind and were instead enslaved by their blood energy.

The Lin Mantra suppresses distracting thoughts, and the "Supreme Goodness is Like Water" Heart Mantra transforms rigidity into softness. It embodies the profound principle described in the Lin Mantra: "Forging a golden body through intense fire, cleansing demonic thoughts with still water."

At this moment, the golden,浆-like blood energy in his髓海 (Sea of Marrow) was still surging, but like a dragon entering an abyss, it was wild but not chaotic.

The Dragon and Tiger Crouching Breathing Technique could even more so hide a crouching tiger and a concealed dragon, completely suppressing the various desires born from his extremely powerful physique.

After thinking for a moment, Xu Yunfan made a vague guess. Perhaps Bi Yuan thought he was too young and his strength had advanced too rapidly, so he secretly sent two women over.

It was said to be a helping hand, but to put it bluntly, it was to alleviate the pressure of the various desires intertwined within his body.

Xu Yunfan found it both funny and exasperating. If he didn't have the Lin Mantra or the Attribute Panel, as he progressed in his cultivation and broke through layer after layer, without any settling at each realm, the various desires within him would naturally run wild like untamed horses.

But in fact, every step he took now was far more stable than that of ninety-nine percent of the martial artists in the world.

When he arrived at the Guest Reception Hall halfway up Clear and Subtle Mountain and saw his master, Zhan Yan, again, the latter was already packing his luggage.

Seeing that Zhan Yan was already packing, Xu Yunfan felt a rush of anxiety and quickly stepped forward. "Master, are you leaving already?"

Zhan Yan stopped what he was doing and saw Xu Yunfan arrive, a smile appearing on his face.

"I was waiting for you,小子 (brat). Otherwise, I would have left long ago."

"Why not stay a few more days?"

Zhan Yan patted his shoulder and laughed. "Silly boy, I've already settled the matters at the Dao Sect and received a big order. It's enough for the Heavenly Work Cave to live comfortably for ten years."

A look of gratification flashed in his eyes. "Now that you are cultivating in the Dao Sect, it is actually a blessing for the Heavenly Work Cave. With a true disciple at the Marrow Cleansing realm holding the fort, if this news gets out, even the Xuanzhen Sect wouldn't dare to move a single hair on the Heavenly Work Cave."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan's tense expression eased slightly, but he was still a bit reluctant to part. "But I have only just joined the Dao Sect and haven't fulfilled my filial duties..."

Zhan Yan laughed heartily, interrupting him. "The path of martial arts is long. Is the bond between master and disciple measured in day and night? Sect Master Bi Yuan treats you well, and the 'Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock' is an unparalleled secret transmission. The Dao Sect's divine skills and extraordinary arts are all-encompassing. Just focus on your cultivation."

As he spoke, he pointed to the Tongxuan Token on the table. "With this, you can return to the Heavenly Work Cave to visit anytime. Are you afraid I'll run away?"

Seeing his master's decision was final, Xu Yunfan said no more. He cupped his fists solemnly. "I will not disappoint your expectations, Master."

Zhan Yan nodded in satisfaction. Before leaving, he lowered his voice and said, "The Dao Sect's waters are deep. Although you have caught Bi Yuan's eye, do not easily set foot in places like the Nine Locks Heart-Testing Array or the Sword Burial Abyss. The larger the sect, the more intertwined the various forces become. There are many small factions. You must be cautious in your words and actions."

He glanced at the faintly visible figure of a Taoist boy outside the hall. "If you encounter any difficulties, you can send a message to the Heavenly Work Cave under the pretext of forging. Our 'Thousand Mechanisms Secret Language' cannot be deciphered by others. Even if I have to risk my life, I will come to help you!"

Xu Yunfan's heart warmed, and he nodded heavily.

Xu Yunfan escorted Zhan Yan all the way to the mountain gate. He watched until his master's figure disappeared at the end of the cloud-sea plank road, where four Dao Sect experts were waiting to escort Zhan Yan back to the Heavenly Work Cave.

He stroked the Dragon's Mouth on his back and stood there for a long time. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, having been severely damaged, had been taken away by Zhan Yan to see if it could be repaired.

A long while later, Xu Yunfan slowly turned, intending to visit the Langhuan Library to find a cane technique, when his steps suddenly halted.

As Xu Yunfan turned, his steps suddenly froze.

On the bluestone steps ahead, a tall man in a cloud-patterned cyan robe stood with his hands behind his back. The mountain wind stirred the hem of his Daoist robe, revealing an ancient long sword hanging at his waist.

This man had sword-like eyebrows that slanted towards his temples, eyes as clear and cold as stars, a nose like a hanging gourd, and stern lips. His entire being was like a sharp sword kept in its sheath. Though not yet drawn, it already exuded a terrifying aura.

The energy around him was as deep and still as an abyss. The breathing of his organs was like the roar of dragons and tigers, showing he had cultivated the Marrow Cleansing realm to its absolute peak. His golden marrow and mercury-like fluid had almost solidified, and he was only one step away from entering the Organ Refining realm.

Even more astonishing was that within a three-zhang radius of where he stood, fallen leaves were moving without wind, spiraling around him. This was the phenomenon that appeared when the "Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock" had reached the "Seven Decisions Open the Inner Heaven's Gate" realm.

Xu Yunfan's brows raised slightly, and the scales of his Dragon Scale Armor tightened silently.

This man was precisely the First True Disciple under the Dao Sect Master Bi Yuan, Chu Cangming, known as the "Blue Sky Sword Soul." He had once, at the peak of the Marrow Cleansing realm, cut through the玄铁 heavy staff of an Organ Refining elder from the Mituo Temple during a sect martial exhibition, earning him fame throughout the world.

Seeing the dark golden luster of the Dragon Scale Armor under Xu Yunfan's robe in the sunlight, his eyes moved slightly, and then a hint of a smile appeared.

"Xu Yunfan, Xu Shidi?"
