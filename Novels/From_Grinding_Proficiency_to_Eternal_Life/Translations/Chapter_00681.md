# Chapter 681: Golden Core Returns After Many Years

The dark ice crystals and the transparent Sword Soul violently ground against each other, annihilating one another.

The chilling intent of the Eternal Night's abyss frantically eroded the Sword Soul's intent, attempting to freeze and decay it.

Tong Xuan True Lord grunted, his face instantly turning a shade paler. The backlash from the Sword Soul and that sinking will nearly caused his mind to lose its composure.

His opponent carried the grand momentum of the heavens and earth, summoning infinite darkness.

He was facing an attack from a major world of considerable standing.

However, he was, after all, a top powerhouse walking the path of the Sword Soul. This Dao Fruit was vacant, having leaped beyond the 108 Heavenly and Earthly Dao Fruits, nurtured by the Sect Master of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

His Sword Intent was incredibly condensed. The giant sword forcibly tore through the shadow of the Eternal Night's claw.

However, before he could catch his breath, the ground beneath his feet suddenly collapsed for no apparent reason. A surge of Earth Vein浊气 (Zhuóqì - turbid energy) shot up into the sky, directly impacting his protective Sword Soul. Caught off guard, he crashed into it head-on, nearly polluting his spiritual power.

This was precisely one of the misfortunes stirred by the Heavenly Dao.

As the saying goes, when the time is right, even the heavens and earth lend their strength; when the time is gone, even heroes are not free.

In this world, without any concealment, the mere movements of the two of them would invite misfortune.

Chi Yang and Tong Xuan stood back to back. The light of the Fenji Sword and the invisible Sword Soul resonated with each other—one scorching, one cold—barely holding on amidst the storm of suppression from the Three Great Gods and the Heavenly Dao.

Chi Yang True Lord's sword style was broad and sweeping. His magma sword arcs moved freely and unscrupulously, incinerating waves of divine radiance.

Tong Xuan True Lord, on the other hand, took an unconventional path. His Sword Soul was like a viper's tongue, striking at flaws and severing the connections of laws.

As veteran Golden Core Sword Cultivators, their killing prowess was indeed peerless. Even in an absolute disadvantage, they could still clash head-on with the Three Great Gods for a short time without falling behind, even launching occasional counterattacks. They left scorching sword marks on the Natural God's massive body and dark fissures on the Light God's holy shield.

But the suppression of the Heavenly Dao was like a maggot in the bone, causing their spiritual power consumption to far exceed the norm. There were always unexpected obstacles in their movements. After a long battle, their Dao robes were torn, and their aura had become chaotic. It was only a matter of time before they fell into a disadvantage.

In the distant void, Xu Yunfan's figure appeared silently, his body shrouded in faint starlight and the obscure fluctuations of karmic secret techniques.

He had already exited the Lin State, his eyes regaining a human-like luster. At this moment, he coldly watched the chaotic battlefield filled with divine light, sword light, magma, darkness, and gale force winds.

Chi Yang and Tong Xuan were like fierce beasts trapped in a mire, tightly entangled by the Three Great Gods and surrounded on all sides. Every attack and defense seemed exceptionally strenuous.

"A strong dragon cannot suppress a local snake; this saying is indeed true."

Xu Yunfan was in no hurry. With the five of them locked in a fierce battle, it would still take some time to determine the victor.

No longer paying attention to the earth-shattering battle behind him, his figure transformed into a faint purple-gold lightning bolt and silently flew toward the Western Wilds of the Desolate Wilderness.

The Western Wilds of the Desolate Wilderness, this once barren land with few gods and backward civilization, had now been turned upside down.

Decades ago, Xu Yunfan had frenziedly hunted weak gods here, seizing their divinity and refining it into Immortal Golden Nature, almost sweeping the local native gods clean and creating a vast vacuum of divinity.

This vacuum was precisely the stage left for Zhang Ziyang.

Xu Yunfan flew past, overlooking the land below.

The once desolate Gobi, sparse jungles, and scattered tribal settlements had been replaced by orderly farmlands, wide flagstone roads, and scattered Taoist temples with a unified style.

Crops grew vigorously in the fields, and pedestrians and merchant caravans came and went on the roads.

Simple and solemn Taoist temples were built against the mountains, with white walls and blue tiles, upturned eaves and arches. Incense smoke curled up, and the sound of chanting sutras could be faintly heard.

In front of the temples, Taoists in blue robes often led believers in practicing martial arts for physical fitness, their movements uniform and orderly, faintly containing a mysterious rhythm.

However, the strange eyes and hair of these people seemed somewhat out of place.

In the main hall of the Taoist temple, enshrined was not any of the original gods of the Aetila world, but a statue of a Taoist in a blue robe, holding a whisk, sitting on a nine-colored lotus platform, with a compassionate expression.

It was none other than Zhang Ziyang, who called himself the "Great Ultimate Savior Heavenly Lord."

This scene made Xu Yunfan exclaim in admiration.

In front of the statue, the incense was flourishing. The pure and concentrated incense offerings, filled with infinite reverence and devotion to the Great Ultimate Savior Heavenly Lord, rose and gathered like golden mist, eventually flowing toward the center of this region—a most magnificent and grand Taoist palace dedicated to the Heavenly Lord.

Xu Yunfan restrained his aura and quietly landed in a secluded courtyard deep within the Taoist palace.

In the courtyard, ancient trees towered into the sky, and spiritual energy was dense, far superior to the outside world.

A figure in a simple blue robe sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, his eyes closed in concentration.

His aura was profound, having actually reached the Great Perfection of the Foundation Establishment realm. A silver star, the condensation of a probing authority, sparkled between his eyebrows. His entire being was shrouded in dense divine power from incense offerings and the Dao rhyme of understanding the subtle. It was indeed Zhang Ziyang.

Zhang Ziyang seemed to sense something and slowly opened his eyes. A silver light flashed within them as he looked at Xu Yunfan with a knowing smile.

"True Lord Shenxiao has graced us with your presence; this poor Taoist failed to welcome you properly."

He stood up, looking at Xu Yunfan with great satisfaction.

"You have truly proven the Golden Core Dao!"

"By mere luck."

Xu Yunfan dispelled the concealment of the Star Spirit Banner and revealed his figure, smiling. "Sect Master, your esteemed position as the 'Great Ultimate Savior Heavenly Lord' seems to be firmly established. The incense is flourishing, and the will of the people is with you. Congratulations. In terms of the purity and vastness of the incense offerings, even an upper-tier god would find it hard to match you, Sect Master."

Zhang Ziyang stroked his beard and smiled.

"Thanks to you, Yunfan. If not for you clearing out the evil spirits of this world and leaving me this pure land and the probing authority, this poor Taoist would not have achieved such a scene. The humans here have long suffered from the desolation of the wilderness and the exploitation of gods. Spreading the teachings and imparting the way to survive, gathering incense to strengthen our Dao—this was following the trend and achieving success naturally. This land is now the foundation of our Taoist kingdom."

His tone was filled with emotion, quite satisfied with the achievements of these past decades. He then changed the subject, looking at Xu Yunfan. "Your aura is as stable as a mountain, and your Shenxiao Dao Fruit is solid and profound. I presume the path to the Golden Core has become a smooth road. However, there seems to be hidden thunder between your brows, and the aura of the界海 (Jièhǎi - Sea of Worlds) has not dissipated. Was this journey fraught with storms?"

Xu Yunfan's smile faded, and his expression turned serious.

"Sect Master, your insight is as clear as fire. There were indeed uninvited guests. The two old fellows from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, Chi Yang and Tong Xuan, chased me all the way to the Sea of Worlds and followed me into the Aetila world."

Upon hearing this, Zhang Ziyang was not startled. Instead, a brilliant light flashed in his eyes. The probing authority fluctuated continuously, pushed to its limit, as if he had instantly deduced countless possibilities.

After a long while, he suddenly clapped his hands and laughed.

"Good, good! Yunfan, Yunfan, you are truly blessed with great fortune! This is a heaven-sent opportunity!"

"Oh? Sect Master, why do you say that?"

Xu Yunfan asked, feigning ignorance, unable to hide the joy on his face. Zhang Ziyang was most likely thinking the same thing as him.

Zhang Ziyang's eyes twinkled, and his speech quickened.

"Have you forgotten? You possess the Thunder Authority and Divine Dominion in this world. It is a plaque recognized by the Heavenly Dao, making you a local deity."
