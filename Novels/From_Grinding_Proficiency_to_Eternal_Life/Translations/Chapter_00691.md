# Chapter 691: The Heavenly Dao and the Great Rat

With the supreme technique of the *Divine Firmament Nine Firmament Mystic Void Indestructible True Scripture*, Xu Yunfan drew upon the destructive thunder power of his own Divine Firmament Dao Fruit. Like billions of purple-gold hammers, it repeatedly forged and tempered the crimson origin.

Every thunderous strike provoked a more violent resistance from the Dao Fruit. Pure Yang fire, like a crimson magma, erupted forth, clashing violently with the purple-gold lightning. Yet, under the rhythm of the Mystic Void Indestructible Dao, it was forcibly bound and fused back together.

This process was extremely perilous. The slightest carelessness would result in the Dao Fruit counteracting, destroying the Inner Cave.

The Angry Countenance on his left arm held the Star Spirit Banner. The already unraveled authority of Great Light within the banner shone in concert, forming a tough, harmonizing barrier. It continuously soothed the destructive energy turbulence caused by the collision of thunder and fire, while simultaneously absorbing the essence of the earth fire to replenish its consumption.

The Ice Desert Countenance on his right arm had flowing mystic light at its fingertips. It formed the Seal of Lin, entering the state of Lin. With the attitude of the Supreme’s disregard for emotion, it precisely regulated the output of every wisp of spiritual power and the landing point of the thunder, ensuring the refinement process proceeded within a controlled frenzy.

The entire earth vein space was illuminated with grotesque and fantastic colors. The roar of intertwined thunder and fire continued day and night, as if forging a new star.

The sooner the refinement was completed, the sooner he could rest easy.

Xu Yunfan naturally would not be careless.

Simultaneously, within the Aeterna World, the flames of war had spread from the scorched earth of the Western Wilds to the ruins of shattered Divine Kingdoms throughout the entire Aeterna continent.

Under the secret guidance of Zhang Ziyang, the local Taiyi Salvation Heavenly尊, the disciples of the Primordial Sect led by Lu Chuan relied on the increasingly perfected Zhou Tian Shift Array to engage in countless bloody tug-of-wars with the invaders of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

As for why there was such a discordant position of the Taiyi Salvation Heavenly尊 in this world, Lu Chuan said he didn't know. He only knew to do as the True Lord instructed.

He asked no questions, spoke no words, and simply fought with all his might.

The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect used the disciples of the North Polar Peak as their vanguard, among whom a Foundation Establishment perfectionist named Ling Jue was particularly eye-catching.

Ling Jue had a tall figure, a face as cold and stern as eternal ice, and a white-gold sword robe spotless and unstained.

His aura was truly heavy and firm. As he walked, his steps seemed to tread upon solidified time, causing the surrounding scenery to appear slightly sluggish due to his existence.

The sword intent he nurtured was the "Perpetual Solidification Sword Domain," derived from the peak master's supreme technique, *Perpetual Heavenly Light Sword Canon*, of the True Lord of Eternal Heavenly Light.

This sword intent did not pursue extreme sharpness or destruction, but focused on stagnation.

Once the sword domain unfolded, within a radius of a hundred zhang, space and time seemed to be thrown into viscous amber. The air was as stagnant as iron, and light flowed sluggishly. The opponent's every move, even the flow of their thoughts and the circulation of their spiritual power, became incredibly difficult, as if a slow-motion button had been pressed.

Yet Ling Jue himself moved freely within this stagnant domain. The fine sword in his hand, named Cold Abyss, transformed into streams of white-gold light that froze time, precisely pointing towards the flaws exposed by the opponent due to their sluggishness.

Lu Chuan and the others had attempted to surround and kill him several times, but suffered heavy losses upon entering the Perpetual Solidification Sword Domain. With their movements sluggish, Ling Jue easily broke their formations, killing several Foundation Establishment True Masters.

If not for Zhang Ziyang using the power of incense and divine ways at critical moments to stir the residual Heavenly Dao rules of Aeterna, slightly disrupting the sword domain, Lu Chuan would have likely paid an even greater price.

Sitting atop Divine Firmament Peak and refining the Dao Fruit, Xu Yunfan's divine sense occasionally swept over the Aeterna battlefield. He only cast a indifferent glance at Ling Jue's performance.

In his eyes, although this youth's sword intent captured a bit of the essence of Perpetual Heavenly Light and walked the path of solidifying space and time, his potential seemed astonishing, but in reality, it had already reached its end.

"He is merely walking the old path of the Eternal Heavenly Light True Lord."

Xu Yunfan's mind moved slightly, but he made no move to intervene.

If Lu Chuan was killed so easily, he wasn't worth Xu Yunfan's attention.

"As long as the Eternal Heavenly Light True Lord does not die, his Dao stands obstructing the way. Even if Ling Jue has talent, he can only stop here. No matter how strong his sword intent, it is ultimately a imitation, lacking the true meaning of proving the Dao. He will never be able to ascend to the position of True Lord based on this Dao Fruit."

This was the cruel truth of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World. Dao Fruits were unique. If the predecessors occupied them, later generations could never rise to prominence unless they found a new path or shattered the predecessors.

No matter how dazzling Ling Jue's Perpetual Solidification Sword Domain was, it could not escape the cage drawn by the Eternal Heavenly Light True Lord.

Ten years passed in the roar of refining the Dao Fruit and the smoke of war within the world.

The changes in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World seemed to have nothing to do with him. As a True Lord, he naturally sat high above the nine heavens, qualified to detach himself from the cage of worldly affairs.

When the last trace of the violent origin of the Luminous Flame Crimson Sun Dao Fruit was completely subdued, transforming into a gentle yet immense crimson stream of fire that perfectly merged into the core of Xu Yunfan's Dan Tian's purple-gold Golden Core, blending seamlessly with the Divine Firmament Thunder and the Mystic Void Inextinguishable Dao Rhyme, an unprecedented, vast power instantly filled his limbs and bones.

The Cultivation Value on the attribute panel surged upward, steadily stopping at 2000.

However, at the very moment this power climbed to its peak, a sudden change occurred.

The natural spiritual energy that originally gathered around Xu Yunfan suddenly seemed to encounter an invisible barrier, automatically detouring around him.

The howling gale at the peak of Divine Firmament Peak instantly fell silent, and the sea of clouds froze motionless.

A cold and vast sense of rejection, originating from this world itself, descended like invisible shackles, silently and soundlessly.

He felt as if he had been isolated by the entire Taihua Spirit Ruins World, becoming a solitary island in a vast ocean.

Looking up at the firmament, though the sky was clear for ten thousand miles, he faintly felt a suppressed aura of destruction brewing and swirling above the nine heavens, as if billions of invisible gazes filled with disgust and judgment had locked onto him.

It was not hostility directed at an individual, but rather a rejection stemming from the world's instincts, a distinct mark branded upon a great rat.

Excessively plundering the world's origin without substantial repayment had caused this world's Heavenly Dao to vaguely regard him as a parasite that needed to be cleared away.

If he took one step further, it would likely not be mere rejection, but the direct descent of destructive Heavenly Punishment, placing him on the blacklist.

"So that's how it is..."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with purple-gold lightning, and he instantly understood why the older True Lords like Universal True Lord and Insightful True Lord sometimes seemed constrained. He also understood why those True Lords often spoke of merit.

The weight of these two words in this world was not an empty reputation, but the key to counteracting this "great rat" label and maintaining harmonious coexistence with the heavens.

Plundering was necessary for survival, but if one only takes without giving, one will eventually be abandoned by the heavens and earth.

Cultivators indeed seek to transcend the heavens and earth, to live against their will.

But before possessing such strength, one naturally needed to maintain good relations, wasn't that right?

As his thoughts raced, Xu Yunfan naturally discovered an excellent opportunity.

If he successfully sacrificed the Aeterna World to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, it would be a perfect chance to obtain a massive amount of Heavenly Dao merit and wash away the label.

A red name tag was unacceptable!

The time had come.

Xu Yunfan's gaze was like lightning, piercing through the endless void and locking onto the Aeterna World.

Zhang Ziyang's transmission divine sense arrived at the appropriate moment.

"Yunfan, the remaining gods of the Aeterna World have all been purged or suppressed. The network of incense and desire has covered the Western Wilds and one-third of the shattered Divine Kingdoms. My Dao foundation is already solid, only awaiting the opportunity to receive the Taihua position."
