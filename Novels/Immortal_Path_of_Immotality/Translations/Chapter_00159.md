# Chapter 158: Constants and Variables

"Who are you..."

Old Man Zhang looked at the two Foundation Establishment guests before him. One of them, a young man in white robes, seemed vaguely familiar, causing him to hesitate momentarily.

"Old Zhang, it's me, Lin Shan! Your successor from Yichuan Auction House!"

As soon as Lin Shan entered the room, he saw an old man and a young girl lying on the bed, seemingly having just finished some "strenuous exercise" and enjoying a leisurely afternoon nap.

"Take a closer look?"

Old Zhang might have been too absorbed in his earlier enjoyment, making his thoughts sluggish for a moment. After scrutinizing the young man for a while, he finally connected him with the young man from Yichuan years ago.

The old man quickly got up and welcomed Lin Shan and the hooded figure in gray robes to sit down. Tea and snacks were served by the young girl.

"After just a few years apart, you've already reached Foundation Establishment. It seems Left Perfected One holds you in high regard!"

In Old Zhang's understanding, Lin Shan's rapid advancement to Foundation Establishment in just a few years must have been due to Left Perfected One's extensive nurturing. After all, Old Zhang himself had only advanced with Left Perfected One's help, who had left him a Foundation Establishment Pill.

Lin Shan smiled without refuting and simply chatted with the old man about recent events.

Though years had passed since they last met, the two never ran out of topics. Lin Shan didn't mention his experiences in the Black Lotus Sect, and Old Zhang didn't pry too much into his past.

Their conversation eventually turned to the local Yinchuan Market.

"Business isn't easy in Yinchuan. Shops are laying off employees, the auction house isn't doing well, and even my monthly salary has been cut to fifty spirit stones!"

"What? Back in Yichuan Auction House, the chief appraiser earned a hundred spirit stones monthly!"

The same position, the same profession, yet the salary was halved. Lin Shan couldn't help but sigh at the hardships faced by rogue cultivators nowadays. Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator like Old Zhang, who had a specialized skill, was struggling to make ends meet.

Even joining a cultivation family as a guest elder meant losing freedom without necessarily earning more than a regular job. Times were truly tough.

Old Zhang, however, remained philosophical: "Yinchuan isn't like Yichuan. Rogue cultivators have retreated into the mountains to live simple lives, and the market is in decline. If not for accompanying my granddaughter, I wouldn't have left Yichuan."

"Oh? This is your granddaughter?"

Lin Shan glanced at the young girl standing behind Old Zhang. She had a delicate face with cherry lips and was at the seventh or eighth layer of Qi Refining. Had she been giving her grandfather a massage earlier?

Thai-style eighteen techniques, ancient spa methods, essential oil back rubs—such high-end skills were rare outside of the "luxury clubs" of his previous life.

Could she be a transmigrator?

---

"My granddaughter is exceptionally talented. Since childhood, her soul power has been twice that of ordinary people, and she possesses dual spiritual roots of fire and wood. I specifically had her study under a master alchemist in Yinchuan, and now she has a forty percent success rate in refining Qi Refining stage pills."

"Forty percent! Truly extraordinary!"

Lin Shan couldn't help but praise. Hearing that her soul power was "twice that of ordinary people" only deepened his suspicion that she might be a transmigrator. Wasn't this the perfect alchemist template?

"My granddaughter could walk at six months, speak at one year, recite the Four Books and Five Classics by three, and comprehend cultivation techniques by five..."

Old Zhang couldn't hide his pride when speaking about his granddaughter to outsiders. For her sake, he had even given up a high salary in Yinchuan Market to return, showing just how much he doted on her.

"Remarkable!"

The girl blushed at Lin Shan's praise, stealing a glance at him. She noticed that this Foundation Establishment senior was not only highly skilled but also strikingly handsome!

Her ears turned red with embarrassment, and she lightly tapped her grandfather's back, signaling him to stop boasting.

Old Zhang laughed heartily, affectionately ruffling her hair.

But then, out of nowhere, Lin Shan suddenly said to the girl:

"Constants and variables!"

"???"

The girl stared at him blankly, utterly confused, her small hands fidgeting nervously.

After a long silence with no response, Lin Shan grew puzzled. Had she not received nine years of compulsory education? That couldn't be! Maybe she was a foreigner?

"Where are you from?"

"???"

"???"

"???"

The girl, Old Zhang, and even Black Skeleton Demon Lord—who had been sipping tea while leaking—all stared at him in bewilderment, completely lost.

She didn't understand English? That couldn't be! Wait—she knew Thai-style massage, and it was authentic! Could she be...?

"สวัสดีครับ, เป็นอย่างไรบ้าง, วันนี้ทำอะไร?"

"..."

The three continued to stare at him in silence, utterly baffled by his antics.

The silence was deafening.

---

After further conversation, Lin Shan finally realized that the girl's massage techniques had all been taught to her by Old Zhang. And Old Zhang had learned them from Lin Shan back in Yichuan Auction House.

It had all been a big misunderstanding. After catching up a bit more, Lin Shan bid farewell, not wanting to intrude further on their family time.

Before leaving, remembering Old Zhang's reduced salary, Lin Shan wanted to help but didn't want to hurt the old man's pride. Instead, he gifted some unused alchemy manuals to the granddaughter.

Having killed many Foundation Establishment cultivators along his journey and acquired numerous storage pouches—including Turtle Perfected One's wealth—he had plenty of items he could spare.

Old Zhang personally saw Lin Shan out of Yinchuan Auction House. The two parted with promises to meet again.

---

With his visit to an old friend concluded, Lin Shan set off with Black Skeleton Demon Lord to track the Black Lotus Sect's large transport flying boat.

However, as they left Yinchuan Market, Lin Shan sensed a faint gaze following them. Restricted by the market's formations, his spiritual sense couldn't extend far, so he pretended not to notice.

Once they were fully outside Yinchuan, a figure quietly followed them out.

"Bold of you, a mere Qi Refining cultivator, to tail two Foundation Establishment experts!"

The man jumped in fright. Turning around, he found Lin Shan and the hooded figure blocking the exit of Yinchuan's perimeter formation, revealing his true identity.

"Red-Faced Monk!"

Lin Shan was stunned to see his stalker was none other than this guy. Had he also come to Huainan?

After all these years, Lin Shan had nearly forgotten about him.

Back at the Yichuan auction, Lin Shan and Old Zhang had teamed up to swindle Red-Faced Monk, preventing him from winning the Rulai Buddha Statue.

On his way back to the capital from Yichuan, Lin Shan had been ambushed by Princess Guo by a mountain stream. Just as he was about to turn the tables, Red-Faced Monk had intervened, leading to a fight that cost Lin Shan the opportunity.

Honestly, if the monk hadn't interfered, Princess Guo might not have lived this long.

Seeing this old acquaintance again filled Lin Shan with joy. Years had passed, yet the monk remained stagnant while Lin Shan had advanced to Foundation Establishment. How times had changed!

"You chose the path to heaven, yet barged through hell's gate!"

Black Skeleton Demon Lord, a denizen of the underworld, couldn't help but correct him.

"Hell has gates—eighteen layers, each with hundreds of portals leading to the next!"

"That's not the point..."

Lin Shan shot him an annoyed glance. Pedantic nitpicking was truly irritating.

---

Red-Faced Monk was trembling in fear. He had only sensed the presence of a Rulai Buddha Statue in Yinchuan Market and had followed the trail.

But with his Qi Refining stage spiritual sense limited to ten meters, how could he detect a Foundation Establishment cultivator's aura?

Only after leaving Yinchuan did he realize the gravity of his mistake—and that the person he'd been tailing was none other than Lin Shan. Back in the Yan Yun Mountains, he had stolen a Rulai Buddha Statue from Lin Shan. Now, the man had become a Foundation Establishment expert!

But how did he have another Rulai Buddha Statue? Was he mass-producing them?

Or was this a setup?
