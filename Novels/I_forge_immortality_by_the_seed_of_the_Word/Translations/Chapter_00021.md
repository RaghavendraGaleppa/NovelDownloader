**Chapter 21: One Man's Poison, Another's Nectar (Bonus Update)**  

In front of the Faqi Pavilion, Zhang Jing approached slowly while surveying the building.  

Though called a "pavilion," it was merely a shop, slightly larger than the herbal medicine store his family ran in Yong'an City. Of course, one sold magical artifacts while the other dealt in medicinal herbs—there was no comparison between the two.  

Just as he was about to step inside, Zhang Jing suddenly overheard an argument coming from within the shop.  

*Bang! Bang!*  

The sound of someone slamming a table echoed loudly.  

"Uncle, this artifact you sold me is defective! There's a blocked spiritual pathway in one of its formations. Why won’t you compensate me? Three spirit stones—just give them to me, and I’ll consider it a loss for buying this broken artifact at such a high price!"  

The voice sounded young but carried the righteous indignation of someone standing up to a shady merchant.  

"Aiyo, Little Linglong, if you want to earn spirit stones, you can’t just keep squeezing your Uncle Chen dry like this," came a weary reply.  

"Do you realize this is the *how many*-th time this month? The artifacts are perfectly fine when I sell them, but by the next day, you always come back claiming something’s wrong—either this part’s broken or that part’s faulty. And the most infuriating part? The moment I compensate you, *poof*—the very next day, you’re out there selling the same artifact in perfect condition at your stall!"  

"Coincidence! It’s all just coincidence!" the young voice protested weakly, her confidence clearly waning.  

Finally, she grumbled, "Fine, I’ll take the loss today. Just give me *one* spirit stone, and we’ll call it even."  

"Not a chance!"  

Seeing the door ajar and the argument showing no signs of stopping, Zhang Jing decided not to wait any longer and strode inside, with Ji Bochang following closely behind.  

The moment his footsteps echoed through the shop, the argument ceased abruptly. Two pairs of eyes turned toward him.  

"Shopkeeper, how are your artifacts priced?" Zhang Jing asked with a faint smile, meeting their gazes directly.  

The interior of the Faqi Pavilion came into full view. Display cases lined both walls, filled with various magical artifacts, each accompanied by descriptions detailing their grade, effects, materials, and price—everything a customer might need to know.  

However, Zhang Jing sensed no spiritual energy emanating from these artifacts. They were likely just display models for customers to examine before purchasing.  

At the center stood a counter, behind which stood a middle-aged man and a girl of about fifteen or sixteen—clearly the two who had been arguing earlier.  

Spotting a potential customer, the shopkeeper hurried out from behind the counter.  

"Esteemed Daoist, all our artifacts are displayed on these shelves. Feel free to browse, and if anything catches your eye—*Young Master Ji*? What brings you here today?"  

Halfway through his sales pitch, the shopkeeper noticed Ji Bochang behind Zhang Jing and immediately greeted him warmly.  

Ji Bochang waved dismissively, his expression unchanged. "Shopkeeper Chen, I’m merely accompanying Brother Zhang today. *He’s* your customer—don’t get it backwards."  

"Ah, of course, of course!" Shopkeeper Chen quickly turned back to Zhang Jing, clasping his hands in apology. "My mistake earlier, Young Master Zhang. Please don’t take offense. Whatever artifact you wish to purchase, whatever your requirements, just name them."  

At that moment, the young girl muttered, "Uncle Chen, I’ll take my leave now," before clutching a blade-shaped artifact and darting out of the shop.  

Only after her figure vanished did the shopkeeper turn back to Zhang Jing with an apologetic smile.  

"Young Master Zhang, please forgive my niece. She’s rather shy."  

Zhang Jing didn’t press the issue and instead focused on the artifacts. "Shopkeeper, how are your defensive artifacts priced?"  

*Defensive artifacts!*  

After much deliberation, Zhang Jing had ultimately decided to prioritize purchasing defensive equipment. After all, he only had one life.  

With the mysterious jade talisman as his safeguard, as long as he survived, his future was assured.  

This decision was also influenced by the new skill trait—*Five Elements Spirit River*—that had appeared after upgrading the mid-grade cultivation method *Five Organs Guiding Water Essence Sutra* to Level 1.  

"Defensive artifacts?" The shopkeeper pondered briefly before asking, "May I ask what grade you’re looking for? To be honest, I only carry low-grade defensive artifacts here. Would those suffice?"  

"What low-grade defensive artifacts do you have?"  

Zhang Jing’s interest was piqued.  

"Right this way."  

The shopkeeper led Zhang Jing to a display case and began introducing each item in detail.  

"This artifact is called the *Golden Light Shield*. It contains a *Vajra Radiance Formation*—when defending against attacks, it emits a dazzling golden light to disorient the enemy. How does that sound, Young Master Zhang?"  

"Uh… sure, sure," Zhang Jing replied stiffly, his expression strained.  

In simpler terms, the shield *blinded people when hit*.  

It was practically *begging* for trouble. What kind of mad genius had crafted such an artifact? No wonder the description on the display was covered in dust.  

After careful consideration, Zhang Jing finally settled on a relatively normal low-grade artifact that matched his spiritual affinity—the *Cloudwater Shield*.  

The price? A steep *thirty spirit stones*.  

At the counter, as Zhang Jing counted out the stones, he asked casually, "Shopkeeper, that girl earlier—she’s not really your niece, is she?"  

The shopkeeper sighed. "Ah, I knew I couldn’t fool someone as sharp as you, Young Master Zhang. That girl’s had a hard life. Her parents died in a cultivation accident, leaving her and her three-year-old brother alone. We old-timers in the neighborhood try to help out where we can."  

"Don’t let her circumstances fool you—she’s got a proud spirit. Always talking about saving up spirit stones to send her brother to the Dao Academy one day."  

Zhang Jing’s eyes softened slightly.  

"I see. Well, we’ll take our leave now."  

With that, Zhang Jing and Ji Bochang departed the Faqi Pavilion.  

Not long after, the girl returned, once again arguing her case for that *one* spirit stone in compensation.  

Once she had it in hand, she asked curiously, "Uncle Chen, who were those two earlier? They spent *thirty spirit stones* like it was nothing!"  

"That Young Master Ji comes from a cultivation family and has already passed the Dao Academy’s entrance exam. His future is boundless!"  

"As for Young Master Zhang, I’d never met him before, but judging by how even Young Master Ji deferred to him, he must also be a Dao Academy disciple—and no ordinary one at that."  

The girl’s eyes sparkled with admiration. "Hehe, my little brother will definitely become a Dao Academy disciple too someday. Maybe he’ll spend spirit stones just as freely!"  

"How wonderful."

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing and Ji Bochang navigated the narrow alleyways before emerging onto the main thoroughfare at the heart of the market.  

At the end of the street stood an ornate three-story building adorned with gold and jade carvings—the *Miaodan Pavilion*.  

"*Miaodan Pavilion*? Brother Ji, are you planning to buy pills here?" Zhang Jing asked curiously.  

"Indeed," Ji Bochang replied. "This pavilion is run by the seventh-ranked alchemy team in the outer academy. Their pills are top-tier in both variety and quality. They’re pricey, but at least you know you’re getting the real deal."  

Zhang Jing nodded and said nothing more.  

He had already obtained the artifact he needed and still had fifteen spirit stones left—not a fortune, but not insignificant either. For now, he had no further purchases in mind.  

Still, since he was already here, he decided to follow Ji Bochang inside to broaden his horizons.  

The moment they entered, a female attendant greeted them warmly.  

"Welcome, honored brothers! How may Miaodan Pavilion assist you today?"  

"Do you have *Violet Spirit Pills*?" Ji Bochang asked.  

The attendant smiled and gestured for them to follow. "Honored brothers, the *Violet Spirit Pills* are one of the supreme cultivation elixirs refined by the Dao Academy’s Thousand Methods Pavilion. Their spiritual essence is exceptionally pure, with no risk of polluting the dantian’s energy. As such, they’re extremely rare—we only have a few left."  

She led them to a counter where five Violet Spirit Pills rested in a transparent jade vial, shimmering faintly.  

"Only these?" Ji Bochang sounded disappointed.  

"Brother, you know how precious these are. We’ve only received five this month. If you need pills for a breakthrough, the *Nourishing Spirit Pills* are a viable alternative—nearly as effective and far more affordable."  

Ji Bochang gave her a meaningful look. "The Nourishing Spirit Pills may be effective, but their impurities seep into the dantian, tainting one’s spiritual energy irreversibly. Only rogue cultivators desperate enough would use them. Who in their right mind would?"  

"I’ll take all five Violet Spirit Pills."  

Zhang Jing nearly choked.  

Each pill cost *twenty spirit stones*—equivalent to an artifact! Yet Ji Bochang had just casually bought all five without blinking.  

*Now that’s what you call extravagance!*  

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing had agonized over spending thirty stones on a single artifact… though, come to think of it, those stones had come from Ji Bochang in the first place.  

*Never mind.*  

Wait—  

Hadn’t the attendant just mentioned *Nourishing Spirit Pills*?  

Pills with effects comparable to the Violet Spirit Pills but priced at only…  

Zhang Jing’s gaze drifted to the corner of the counter, where the Nourishing Spirit Pills were labeled:  

*Two spirit stones per pill.*  

The only downside was that their impurities polluted the dantian’s energy?  

For others, this might be a dealbreaker—but for Zhang Jing, who possessed the *Spirit-Gathering Radiance*, it was negligible.  

After all, one of the radiance’s primary functions was *purging impurities* and refining spiritual energy.  

In other words, he could effectively obtain *Violet Spirit Pills* for a fraction of the price—*with no limits on quantity!*  

With his remaining fifteen stones, he could buy *seven* "Violet Spirit Pills"!  

This meant the geniuses backed by task teams would *lose* their resource advantage against him.  

A flicker of excitement flashed in Zhang Jing’s eyes, but he quickly suppressed it.  

First, he needed to confirm how quickly the Spirit-Gathering Radiance could cleanse the impurities.  

If it took *years* to purify the effects of seven Nourishing Spirit Pills, the trade-off wouldn’t be worth it.  

"Better test one first," he decided.
