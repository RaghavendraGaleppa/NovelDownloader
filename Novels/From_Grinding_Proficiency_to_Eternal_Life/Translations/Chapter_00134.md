# Chapter 134: The Empress

The sound of heavy hammers colliding and rock walls collapsing exploded simultaneously.

By the time Xu Yunfan landed, dragging the headless corpse with him, the head of the Thunderfire Hammer was still dripping with brain matter.

A quarter of an hour later, Yan Yuwei finished off the last of the cultists and set the entire place ablaze.

"Let's go. We need to return to the Sky Crafting Cave immediately."

Although the route from here to Guniu Mountain was a bit of a detour, for the two of them traveling at full speed, it took no more than ten minutes to arrive.

Without further hesitation, the two set off for Guniu Mountain.

***

In the Jade Capital Prefecture, within the Jade Capital City of the Great Zhou Empire, atop the ninefold palace halls of the Imperial Palace, lead-gray clouds pressed down extremely low.

At the exact center of the palace, the 533-zhang tall Astronomical Observatory pierced through the sea of clouds. The gilded bronze armillary sphere turned slowly amidst the clouds, and the twenty-eight lunar mansions glimmered with a ghostly light within the gloom.

The tower was carved from a single block of Kunlun Black Jade. On stormy nights, the entire tower would reveal dense, intricate talismans amidst the lightning—these were the Spirit Suppressing Talismans, inscribed with blood by eight hundred alchemists of the previous dynasty.

Although it originally possessed no supernatural power, after enduring the baptism of thunder and rain day and night and devouring the fortune of the Great Zhou, it eventually revealed a faint, peculiar brilliance that lingered around it.

Inside the grand hall, the Empress’s withered fingers traced the armrest of the Dragon Throne. The Five-Clawed Golden Dragon carved into the thousand-year-old red sandalwood had been rubbed smooth until its scales were indistinct.

Supported by twelve golden pillars coiled with dragons, the hall was filled with the curling green smoke belched by bronze crane lamps, yet it could not disperse the scent of decay lingering below the dais.

The Empress radiated an aura of twilight that could no longer be contained, soaking the entire hall.

"Your Majesty, the Incense Fire Cult has, as dictated by the Celestial Evolution Records, arranged the Blood Lotus Formation in six vital prefectures."

Guo Lang, the Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, prostrated himself on the gold bricks with their ice-crack pattern. Cold sweat on the back of his neck soaked the peacock insignia on his robes.

"Since the snow melted and spring began, the Incense Fire Cult has conducted sacrifices in Wuzhou, Cangzhou, and Qingzhou in Yanbei Prefecture; in Jianzhou and Yangzhou in Jiangnan Prefecture; in Yizhou and Kuizhou in Jiannan Prefecture; in Yongzhou and Yazhou in Lingnan Prefecture; and in Shengzhou and Fengzhou in Monan Prefecture. The total number of sacrifices..."

At this point, Guo Lang’s voice suddenly choked. The final few words refused to leave his throat.

"The number."

The Empress's voice sounded as if filtered through bronze chimes, carrying the grating rasp of metal scraping against metal. The heavy aura of decline seemed to disturb the very hall, accelerating its decay.

Guo Lang’s Adam's apple bobbed. "Exceeding twelve million people."

A sound of fingernails scraping against jade came from behind the mica screen.

The Empress leaned against a soft cushion inlaid with pearls. The nine-tasseled crown hanging from her white hair swayed slightly; amidst the clinking of the pendant beads, there was a sound of impatience and anxiety.

"Not enough. It is not enough."

These words, spoken by the Empress, made Guo Lang’s spine turn cold with fear.

He dared not look up. In his vision, there was only the wave patterns on the hem of the Empress's dragon robe. Within the golden threads of the embroidered waves, a face of extreme aging was faintly visible.

"The progress of the sacrifice in Shengzhou, Monan Prefecture, is seventy percent slower than expected."

The Empress suddenly leaned forward. Through the gaps in her crown, a face as withered as tree bark was revealed. "Lord Guo, do you know why?"

Guo Lang’s heart trembled. He instantly realized that the Empress had other channels to obtain information. He hurriedly replied, "Reporting to Your Majesty, the Governor of Shengzhou died suddenly last month. The new Governor gathered the provincial troops to suppress the Incense Fire Cult..."

"Dispatch an edict."

The Empress interrupted the report, her voice suddenly sharp. "Conscript all men over the age of seventeen in Shengzhou as blood sacrifices. Order the Black Armor Guard to supervise the construction of a mass grave."

Her voice suddenly slowed. "Shengzhou is a melting pot of races, fundamentally different from our Great Zhou. It is acceptable to kill them all."

The rhythm of her knuckles tapping the armrest resonated with the copper bells coming from the observatory outside. "Tell the Bright Lord of the Incense Fire Cult that if he does not gather three hundred and sixty million living souls by the seventh day of next month, I shall use the State-Stabilizing Cauldron to refine his Incense Fire Golden Body."

Guo Lang pressed his forehead tightly against the ground.

The chill seeping from the cracks in the gold bricks climbed up his nasal bone into his skull. He suddenly remembered how, three years ago, in the secret room of the observatory, he had personally supervised three hundred boys and girls being poured alive into the foundation of the armillary sphere. Their screams mixed with the boiling sound of molten bronze to form a bizarre Buddhist chant.

Regret began to生出 (shēng chū - arise/grow) in Guo Lang's heart.

But things had come to this; he could not turn back.

"Your Majesty, the method of blood sacrifice in the previous dynasty..."

"The废物 (fèiwù - trash/waste) of the previous dynasty couldn't even sever the sleeping Dragon Veins! The Great Li Dynasty failed in their blood sacrifice; does that mean the Great Zhou cannot succeed?"

The Empress stood up abruptly. The twelve panels of her gold-woven skirt swept a teacup off the table. In the shattered Yue kiln porcelain, the leftover tea actually turned a scarlet red.

She walked out from behind the screen, her withered eyes fixed intently on Guo Lang.

"What I want is for the Spirit Essence of Heaven and Earth to awaken completely, for the spiritual pivot sealed eight hundred years ago to reopen! Do those martial sects enjoy sitting on the fence? Order the Incense Fire Cult to find a way to blow up the Taiyi Cave of Longhu Mountain and the Damo Grotto of Mituo Temple!染上 (rǎn shàng - dye/infuse) the air of blood sacrifice there, let them witness the return of the Spirit Essence of Heaven and Earth. Then, they will naturally know what to do."

A sudden thunderclap exploded outside the hall.

As she spoke, a bizarre, inexplicable smile suddenly appeared on the Empress's face.

"Those old monsters who refuse to die are actually even more anxious than I am."

Guo Lang, his mind and spirit trembling, caught a glimpse of scale-like patterns faintly appearing beneath the Empress's dragon robe.

The signs of mutation caused by consuming the Elixir of Life.

His heart skipped a beat. Upon hearing the Empress's words, his liver and gallbladder trembled even more.

"Your Majesty, please reconsider!" Guo Lang finally looked up, only to see the Empress stroking her cheek while facing a bronze mirror behind the screen.

The reflection in the mirror was clearly that of a young woman, but when he blinked, it turned back into a face covered in chicken skin and crane-white hair.

"The Taiyi Cave and the Damo Grotto are places where the ancestors of the two sects have been enshrined for generations. They have long contained deities, no different from that Bright Lord. If the Six Great Sects were to join forces and counterattack..."

"You don't understand..."

The Empress lowered her hand from her cheek. A pure white vital energy, clearly visible to the naked eye, lingered at her fingertips, absorbing auras from a scarlet blood basin beside the bronze mirror and drawing them into her body.

Guo Lang saw this clearly, and his mind became even more of a tangled mess.

When had this happened?

The Empress had actually become a supreme Grandmaster of the Ninth Realm of Qi Cultivation.

The Empress continued, "Once they taste the flavor, those dying old monsters will not only fail to stop it but will secretly add fuel to the fire. Do you think that when the Incense Fire Cult caused trouble in Wuzhou as a test initially, the Six Great Sects didn't come to ask me? They asked, they knew. The moment they spouted talk of benevolence and justice yet chose to stand by and watch, I understood..."

"They are all the same kind of people as me!"

She turned her head to look at Guo Lang kneeling below. Guo Lang hurriedly lowered his head.

"Lord Guo." The Empress's voice suddenly became ethereal. Her white hair turned black before his very eyes.

"What I have always wanted is never the empire."

The Empress's wrinkles were receding, yet her voice grew older. "When those cultivators of eight hundred years ago sealed the last remaining Spirit Veins, they should have foreseen this day. Even if I don't do it, someone else will."

Looking at the trembling Guo Lang, the Empress said calmly, "Today is merely a slight ailment. Once the Spirit Essence of Heaven and Earth is reopened and I can live a second life, the Great Zhou will naturally flourish. Everything done now is just a momentary pain."
