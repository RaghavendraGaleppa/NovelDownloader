# Chapter 53: A Demon Core Comes Knocking

Checking the time, Zhang Jing saw there were still a few hours until dawn. He got out of bed, stretched his limbs slightly, and turned toward the meditation chamber—now converted into a talisman workshop, with spirit paper and ink neatly arranged on the table.

Though uncertain about future business prospects, preparing more talismans couldn't hurt.

Soon after, the candlelight on the table before him dimmed abruptly. A crimson spiritual glow rose slowly from Zhang Jing's body, faintly forming a red cloud illusion above his head. Deep within his consciousness, a phantom third eye cracked open slightly.

Time to begin! Drawing the Dao patterns! Spiritual energy moved with his thoughts!

Time flowed quietly. Before he knew it, seven successfully crafted Star Guidance Talismans lay on the table, with only two failed attempts.

The next day at Twin Phoenix Street.

A group of travel-worn rogue cultivators slowly passed through the archway into the market district. Among them were two men and two women, all appearing to be in their thirties or forties. Their weather-beaten faces betrayed hints of excitement.

"What incredible luck, stumbling upon an injured demon. This haul should fetch us some good stuff. Any thoughts on what we should trade for?" the leader, a man, asked quietly.

"How about some Purple Spirit Pills? You're close to breaking through to the third level of Qi Refinement," suggested a woman in purple robes. "Once you advance, hunting demons will be safer for all of us."

Another woman proposed, "Why not exchange it for guidance from one of the Dao Academy's senior cultivators?"

The man at the rear chuckled and countered, "At our current cultivation level, isn't seeking instruction from the Academy's seniors a bit extravagant? I say we get some life-saving items instead." After a pause, he added, "We can't count on being as lucky as yesterday every time. What if that had been an uninjured third-level demon?"

Just then, the purple-robed woman, scanning their surroundings, suddenly noticed something. "Look! A new talisman shop opened here. Should we check it out?"

The others followed her gaze, their expressions turning curious. "A talisman shop? The owner seems..."

"Shall we go see?"

"Let's go!"

Approaching the shop, they spotted a wooden sign by the entrance: "Demon cores accepted for discounted talismons!"

Their faces lit up with delight.

"Welcome! What can I do for you, junior brother?"

Behind the counter, Zhang Jing wore a warm smile as he regarded the blue-robed man who'd entered—his first customer. Sensing the man's second-level Qi Refinement cultivation, Zhang Jing felt perfectly justified in using the familiar "junior brother" address.

"Senior brother, I'd like to browse first," the man replied respectfully.

"Take your time."

As the man moved to examine the talismans on display, his gaze locked onto them instantly. "Star Guidance Talismans, Blazing Sun Talismans, Spirit Healing Talismans—all premium quality?! And these prices—"

His breathing grew heavy. Having been in Langya County on assignment for over half a month, this was his first encounter with premium talismans in this temporary market—and their prices matched the standard-quality ones sold elsewhere! While still pricier than the Dao Academy's Thousand Techniques Pavilion, this was Langya County, not the Academy!

Could this senior brother really be this generous? Sneaking another glance at Zhang Jing, the man's initial plan to conserve merit points by buying just one or two emergency talismans vanished, replaced by an urge to purchase several. What if others discovered this place and bought everything?

After a moment's hesitation, determination flashed across his face. "Senior brother, I'll take three—no, four Star Guidance Talismans, one Blazing Sun Talisman, and one Concealment Talisman."

"Four Star Guidance, one Blazing Sun, one Concealment—that's eleven and a half merit points. Are you sure?"

The man gritted his teeth and nodded.

"By the way, junior brother, if you have any demon cores, you'll get twenty percent off," Zhang Jing kindly reminded.

"If I had any, I'd have offered them already," the man replied with a strained smile.

The reminder only made his heart ache more. Twenty percent off would have saved enough merit points for two Purple Spirit Pills!

After receiving his talismans, the man offered quick thanks before hurrying away.

No sooner had he left than four figures appeared at the shop's entrance. After cautiously peering inside, they entered with curious expressions.

"Feel free to look around. Just let me know what you'd like," Zhang Jing greeted them.

"Thank you for your hospitality, honored cultivator."

Noticing Zhang Jing's Dao Academy robes, the four immediately grew more deferential, their words carefully polite as they gathered around the counter to examine the talismans.

After thorough inspection, they exchanged excited glances.

"Honored cultivator," their leader asked cautiously, "does your sign's offer—twenty percent off for demon cores—still stand?"

"Absolutely," Zhang Jing replied, studying them. "Do you have one?"

The leader produced a jade box from his storage pouch, opening it respectfully. "We obtained this from a third-level demon. Please examine it."

Zhang Jing inspected the core with his spiritual sense and nodded approvingly. "A genuine third-level demon core. Do you know its value?"

"We inquired earlier. It can be exchanged for about thirteen merit points worth of resources from your Academy," the man answered carefully.

"Correct," Zhang Jing confirmed, storing the core. "You may select talismans totaling up to thirteen merit points at twenty percent off."

"Thank you, honored cultivator!" The leader bowed excitedly as the four huddled together to make their selections.

Zhang Jing watched contentedly—this single core would net him over thirty merit points in profit.

Soon, the group departed happily, leaving the shop quiet once more.

In a secluded corner outside, the leader confirmed they were alone before whispering excitedly, "We've struck gold! That shop sells premium-quality talismans!"

"What's the plan?" another man asked.

"Find anyone else with demon cores, buy them, and exchange them here. The offer lasts only three days—we must act fast!"

"Split up and move quickly!"

"Understood!"
