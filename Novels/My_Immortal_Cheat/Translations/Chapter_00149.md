**Chapter 149: King of Gods**

Zhou Tian once again ascended the ancient throne. After a bout of dizziness, he re-entered that unique space. This time, he wasn't in a hurry to leave. He looked around; the space seemed to have no boundaries. Although it appeared to be only a short distance, it seemed to shift with his movements.

A moment later, Zhou Tian's pupils contracted. A flash of light appeared, and an old man in a hemp robe emerged. His face was sallow, and his eyes were lifeless. He walked up to Zhou Tian and spoke, "What runs but never walks, has a mouth but never speaks, has a head but never weeps, and has a bed but never sleeps?"

Zhou Tian paused, unsure what kind of trick this place was playing, or why a person would suddenly appear to give him a riddle. However, such riddles weren't difficult for him. After thinking for a moment, he replied, "A river."

"Congratulations, you answered correctly," the old man said emotionlessly before vanishing. Zhou Tian scratched his head, finding it amusing.

Another flash of light, and a young woman appeared, her eyes equally lifeless, her face expressionless. She walked up to Zhou Tian and asked, "What is vast but never grows, has invisible roots, and is taller than a tree?"

"..." Zhou Tian was speechless. Wasn't this an insult to his intelligence?

"A mountain."

"Congratulations, you answered correctly."

After that, five more people appeared—a child, an adult, and others—each presenting him with a riddle, and he answered every single one.

Finally, the sound of glass shattering echoed, and Zhou Tian's consciousness returned to his body. Simultaneously, an inexplicable stream of information poured into his mind.

A look of exasperation flashed across Zhou Tian's face. "The Lord of Riddles? No wonder it's the weakest of the gods."

Through the information that had just appeared in his mind, Zhou Tian understood that what he had just experienced was the trial for the Riddle Divine Position, and he had passed it. He could now inherit the Riddle Divine Position and become the new Lord of Riddles.

The misty, glowing substance also unveiled its mysterious facade: it was an enigmatic symbol. From the recent information, Zhou Tian learned that this was the Riddle Divine Position itself.

Zhou Tian didn't even glance at it and left immediately. He had no interest whatsoever in such a pathetic, low-tier divine position. He wondered how the previous Lord of Riddles had written their doctrines. Other gods preached faith in Holy Light or faith in Death, but what would he say? "Come, solve a new riddle!" The thought alone was embarrassing.

Without lingering among the weaker divine seats at the back, Zhou Tian headed directly to the front rows—those were where the powerful divine positions lay.

Among the top five rows, representing the ten most powerful gods, only one seat held a divine inheritance, located in the third row. Zhou Tian didn't know what kind of divine position it was, but it certainly wouldn't be weak. He instantly teleported onto it, but a moment later, he was instantly teleported out.

"Why is this trial so difficult?" Zhou Tian let out a wry smile. This trial was on a completely different level from that bothersome Riddle Lord's trial. The test wasn't complicated: upon entering, he was given a wooden bow and told to hunt a few creatures.

These creatures were three Fiery Hounds, a Frost Giant Wolf, a Hundred-Armed Giant, and an Ouroboros Serpent. A single strand of hair or a scale from these creatures was several times larger than Zhou Tian himself. Moreover, their eyes were full of spiritual energy, and they possessed impressive combat intelligence, far beyond anything the riddle trial could offer.

Zhou Tian looked around and realized that although he had snuck in, there wasn't much he could do. Finally, his gaze fell upon the seat of the King of Gods. If a divine position in just the third row was so formidable, let alone the trial of the King of Gods... Yet, an irresistible urge, like an itch he couldn't scratch, made him want to see it.

"Damn it, it's not like it can kill me!"

Zhou Tian made up his mind and instantly teleported over. The same dizzying sensation enveloped him, and then he appeared amidst a sea of stars. Before him sat a man. Beauty and ugliness had ceased to have meaning for this individual; Zhou Tian didn't know how to describe him.

He wore a simple robe, seated cross-legged in the void. Universes and stars revolved around him. Worlds seemed to be born and destroyed with the opening and closing of his eyes, and every strand of his hair was incredibly lustrous, like the Milky Way flowing.

"Why has a mortal from the Futian Realm entered here?" the man spoke, and the stars began to rotate slowly.

"The King of Gods?" Zhou Tian tentatively asked.

"Indeed, mortal. Answer my question." The King of Gods furrowed his brow slightly. In the void, stars burst, transforming into brilliant fire and fading away. Zhou Tian was startled, but the small space he and the King of Gods occupied was special, and those cosmic phenomena were merely illusions, unable to affect this place. He gave the King of Gods a speechless look. *Must you always show off?*

"How do you know I'm from the Futian Realm?" Zhou Tian asked. This King of Gods had immediately known his origin, even though it wasn't written on his forehead.

"I am the King of Gods, omniscient. Mortal, how did you come to this place?" The King of Gods' talent for showing off was ingrained in his very bones.

"Your Divine Realm vanished long ago. We excavated a dilapidated palace on a small mountain, and I don't know how I ended up here," Zhou Tian replied, his bluffing skills having reached perfection, the words rolling off his tongue.

"Haha, mortal, no need to deceive me. The Holy Gods came at my summons. I know everything. However, the seal I placed on the Divine Palace has not yet reached the time for its release, so it is utterly impossible for you to have entered." The King of Gods laughed heartily, as if amused by Zhou Tian. His hair flew wildly, deeply rooted in the void.

"Your seal is nothing but a decoration," Zhou Tian retorted. He had already figured it out. This old man acted as if he had a high-class aura, but in reality, he seemed utterly unable to act. Otherwise, why would he blabber so much with a mere mortal like him?

"You are seeking death, mortal!" the King of Gods roared. A colossal star approached from beyond the realm, terrifyingly immense. Zhou Tian swallowed hard, not out of fear, but from an indescribable sense of awe.

As it drew near, the star vanished. Just as Zhou Tian had suspected, the King of Gods was indeed severely limited in his actions. He had died in ancient times, but his immense power allowed him to leave behind a trace of a remnant soul through his divine position.

It wasn't that he couldn't act at all. Since the divine position was no longer entirely his, he only had one chance to forcefully intervene, after which his remnant soul would dissipate. He didn't want to waste this opportunity on a mortal like Zhou Tian.

"Mortal, which family are you from in the Futian Realm?" The King of Gods retracted all his strange phenomena. In his view, Zhou Tian was so brazen and fearless that he must have some understanding of him, and his background was certainly extraordinary.

"My surname is Zhou," Zhou Tian said after a moment's thought. This wasn't something he couldn't say, but he also kept a wary eye, only revealing his surname.

"Zhou? So you are from the Zhou family of the Futian Realm. As expected of an ancient clan, even a mere mortal possesses such courage." The King of Gods sighed, speaking with a hint of emotion, seemingly having had considerable dealings with the Zhou family.
