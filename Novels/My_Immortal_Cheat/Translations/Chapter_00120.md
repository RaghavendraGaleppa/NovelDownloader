# Chapter 120: Apostles of Death

Zhou Tian pondered all his skills, realizing it was quite difficult for him to kill anyone. With a helpless smile, his figure flickered, and he vanished directly from the center of the formation. Zhou Tian's current one-time teleportation distance was nearly 2,900 meters, enough to completely shake off these black-robed figures.

The black-robed figures stared at each other, wide-eyed, watching the sudden scene unfold. Zhou Tian's reappearance didn't really surprise them too much, as he had managed to injure one of them. How could he have only a tiny bit of vitality? He must have used some divine ability. However, Zhou Tian's method of leaving the formation was beyond their expectations. This wasn't a formation composed of ordinary chains; the chains were crafted from fragments of divine artifacts, and the formation itself was taught to them by the deity they had just contacted. Even if the Pontiff of the Holy God Church were trapped within, their survival would be uncertain, yet Zhou Tian left directly, which was incredibly hard for them to believe.

Ignoring the black-robed figures, Zhou Tian, having escaped the formation, returned to where Mu Su and Ling Yu were.

"Why were you gone for so long today?" Mu Su asked as soon as he appeared. After so many days together, he had basically figured out Zhou Tian's "streaking" duration, but today was noticeably longer than usual.

"Something happened; I ran into seven old black-robed guys," Zhou Tian said, pulling on his clothes and calling out to Ling Yu from behind the ancient tree. "Ling Yu, do you know who uses pitch-black chains?"

Ling Yu emerged from behind the big tree, her brows slightly furrowed. "Pitch-black chains? Chains are very common in dark-sided divine systems. Punishment, binding souls... many sects use them. I do too." As she spoke, light shimmered in her hand, and a black chain solidified into form.

"Is there any other information?" Ling Yu asked, understanding that Zhou Tian must have encountered someone specific and was seeking her knowledge.

"Their chains weren't formed from energy," Zhou Tian recalled the details carefully. "They could also form a formation that absorbed people's vitality, and it was accompanied by an extremely intense sensation of pleasure." A mysterious smile appeared on Zhou Tian's face.

Ling Yu looked at Zhou Tian's smile and instantly got goosebumps, showing a look of disgust. Nevertheless, she said, "Based on the information you've provided, I think I know. The opponents should be followers of the God of Death. They are the seven apostles of the God of Death Sect. Their chains are made from fragments of items once touched by the God of Death, possessing extremely mysterious power. In this land, their sect is on the same level as the Holy God Church."

"The God of Death is an extremely powerful deity, not strictly belonging to the dark side, but rather a neutral deity. Their doctrine believes that death is humanity's highest pursuit, and the intense sensation of pleasure accompanying the absorption of vitality to cause death is their most distinctive feature." Ling Yu explained in detail to Zhou Tian.

"You encountered them?"

"According to what you said, I must have encountered them." Zhou Tian replied.

"What were they doing?" Ling Yu asked. With the Pantheon reopening, everyone was eyeing the divine positions within. Every subtle move could be part of a huge conspiracy, especially from an ancient and powerful sect like the God of Death Sect, which was even more likely to be plotting something.

"They were extracting the vitality of some powerful creatures and collecting it in some kind of container." Zhou Tian recalled that when he was ambushed, the black-robed figures who trapped the Purple Crystal Winged Tiger seemed to have taken out something. Now, he realized it must have been for storing vitality.

"Absorbing vitality?" Ling Yu frowned deeply, a thoughtful expression on her face. Absorbing vitality wasn't strange; they were, after all, apostles of the God of Death Sect, believing that bringing death was their inherent duty. The crucial point was that they were absorbing it in the dangerous Myriad Gods Mountain Range, and at this particular juncture.

"My Spider Sect once had contact with them. There's a peculiar belief within their sect: in the countless years of the past when divine miracles didn't manifest, they didn't seem to believe the God of Death had abandoned them. They firmly believe the God of Death will return from oblivion. It's highly probable that they are making preparations for the God of Death's return now." Ling Yu made her conjecture based on information obtained from the Spider Sect.

Zhou Tian nodded. With the Pantheon approaching, all sorts of monsters and demons were emerging. Fortunately, to avoid danger for Mu Su and Ling Yu, he had chosen territories of fierce beasts that were relatively far away. Those apostles of the God of Death wouldn't find them for a while. Zhou Tian himself wasn't afraid, but Mu Su and Ling Yu would probably be in serious trouble.

"Let's go. It looks like we should be able to cross this branch range today." After a moment of thought, Zhou Tian exhaled and said. Their current location was only a branch of the Myriad Gods Mountain Range. After crossing it, there was still some distance to travel before reaching Myriad Gods Mountain itself.

The three set off again. As they pushed aside the last branch, a vast and boundless plain appeared before them. The reddish-yellow earth was filled with ravines and cracks, and yellow sand permeated the air. Amidst the swirling sand, colossal withered bones and broken buildings loomed faintly. Incredibly thick pillars, nearly a hundred zhang tall, were slanted into the earth, with a shattered half-statue beside them, split in two by some unknown force. Though eroded for countless years, the material it was originally made from was no ordinary substance, and its peculiar, non-human facial features could still be vaguely discerned. This was merely a tiny microcosm; the entire plain was essentially a landscape of broken walls and ruins.

Mu Su was stunned. He had never seen such a breathtaking scene. Zhou Tian, however, was fine, having witnessed even more awe-inspiring sights in Tianqin.

"This is the Myriad Gods Plain!" Ling Yu said softly, her eyes filled with longing. "In ancient times, every deity had a temple here, distributed from weakest to strongest, leading up to Myriad Gods Mountain, the Pantheon, and the Temple of the King of Gods!" Ling Yu pointed. At the far end of the plain stood Myriad Gods Mountain, its pillar of light still reaching through the heavens and earth, its radiance undiminished.

Although it was now all broken walls and ruins, in ancient times, this place was where myriad gods converged—sacred, evil, chaotic—all manifested here. Deities walked among mortals; it was the most prosperous scene in the divine realm. "The existence of this place is rarely spread. Ordinary people don't know about it because these scenes would damage the image of the gods. This is the decline of the gods."
