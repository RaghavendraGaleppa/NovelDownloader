## Chapter 100: Next Life, I Will Kill You!

“Damn your mother’s head!”

Before his words fully fell, Lu Yang had already arrived at the center of the Eight Hundred Li Skeleton Mountain. A sinister grin instantly appeared on his face as he reached out and grabbed towards the earth-veins below.

Rumble!

Instantly, the heavens shook and the earth quaked. An extremely dense surge of Yin Qi burst forth from the earth-veins, transforming into a boundless, turbid river hanging in the sky.

This was the [Heavenly Corpse Malice]!

This malice, originally hidden deep within the Skeleton Mountain’s earth-veins, was now forcibly extracted by Lu Yang, instantly triggering a massive earthquake both inside and outside Skeleton Mountain!

Immediately after, the turbid long river cascaded down from the sky, engulfing Lu Yang. The scattered fiery essence that originally belonged to the [Blazing Dragon] on his body was instantly extinguished. Upon seeing this, Subduing Dragon Arhat’s eyebrows twitched, and a look of surprise appeared in his eyes: “Heavenly Corpse Malice? This place actually possesses such a thing?”

The [Blazing Dragon] is born from the combination of Yang Wood and Yin Earth. Its fire is fierce, but its foundation is Wood Qi, propelled by Earth. Therefore, it fears no fire-restraining elements. To deal with it, one must find a way through the Earth and Wood Qi.

“The [Heavenly Corpse Malice] is located in the Earthly Malice position, belonging to [Zhi Xu], which is also Yin Earth!”

“Yin Earth is soft and pliable. Soft Earth can generate Wood and is not overcome by Wood, hence it does not fear abundant Wood. Earth can also absorb Water and is not swept away by Water, hence it does not fear raging Water.”

This Earthly Malice fears neither Water nor Wood!

Although it cannot completely counter the [Blazing Dragon], it can absorb the blazing white fiery essence it generates on Lu Yang’s behalf, causing it to gradually dissipate into nothingness.

Strictly speaking, these two powerful elements are even compatible with each other, capable of forming a path to a fruit position. However, upon seeing this, Subduing Dragon Arhat showed no trace of greed. Instead, he instinctively took a step back, as if he had seen something he greatly feared.

“[E Fang], [Zhi Xu]...”

The path formed by the convergence of these Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch forces corresponds to only one fruit position in the world, yet True Person Fuluo dared not cultivate that fruit position. Its name is: [Lamp Flame]!

‘If I were to take this, I would become the dao enemy of that fierce individual, Chongguang. It would truly be asking for trouble, and the Bodhisattvas in the Pure Land might not necessarily protect me.’

Thinking of this, Subduing Dragon Arhat immediately shook his head and once again exhaled the [Blazing Dragon]. The intense fiery essence collided with the river formed by the [Heavenly Corpse Malice]. Before long, the river gradually dried up. After all, one side was imbued with the magical power of a Foundation Establishment True Person, while the other was merely water without a source.

“Patron, are you still planning a desperate struggle?”

Due to the appearance of the [Heavenly Corpse Malice], Subduing Dragon Arhat’s tone gradually turned unfriendly. He had clearly lost patience and no longer wished to entangle himself with Lu Yang.

Boom!

His response was an earth-shattering bang, as the entire [Yama Hall] was thrown by Lu Yang, smashing down on his head like a heavy hammer.

“More of these petty tricks...”

Subduing Dragon Arhat shook his head and, using the same trick, conjured a protective spiritual light from above his head. It resembled a lotus canopy, making him appear even more sacred.

However, the next second, his expression changed.

“Explode!”

Before he could react, Lu Yang had already performed a hand seal, and the [Yama Hall], as majestic as a mountain, disintegrated with a roar, like a spark igniting gunpowder.

And the gunpowder was the [Heavenly Corpse Malice]!

Rumble!

The next second, as the turbid river was detonated by the disintegration of the [Yama Hall], dark clouds instantly gathered above the entire Skeleton Mountain, and countless lightning snakes appeared across the sky!

“Not good!”

Witnessing this scene, Subduing Dragon Arhat was no longer as casual as before. His face turned ghastly pale. Neither the self-destruction of the [Yama Hall] nor the [Heavenly Corpse Malice] could harm him. What truly made his expression change was that with the [Heavenly Corpse Malice]'s self-detonation, the entire Skeleton Mountain’s earth-veins were also ruined!

“Destroying an earth-vein, incurring heavenly wrath!?”

Subduing Dragon Arhat’s right hand continuously performed hand seals to calculate, and a look of shock and fury appeared on his face: “How could this person possess such a method? Who exactly is he?”

He had only come following the sensing of the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art*. As for Lu Yang’s karma, he hadn't truly grasped it and hadn't cared much. After all, as a Foundation Establishment True Person, wasn’t dealing with a Qi Condensation cultivator as easy as picking something up?

But he never expected Lu Yang to possess such a method!

In reality, this was Grandmaster Ting You’s last trump card. In the past, the Golden Core sword qi had failed to completely annihilate the Witch-Ghost Dao precisely because Grandmaster Ting You had hijacked the Eight Hundred Li Skeleton Mountain’s earth-veins through the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm. Under necessary circumstances, Grandmaster Ting You could detonate the entire Skeleton Mountain’s earth-veins, which would immediately attract heavenly punishment and diminish one's merit and fortune. Such grand karma was something even a Golden Core True Monarch would be unwilling to incur, which was why the Witch-Ghost Dao was left a sliver of hope, choosing instead to slowly wear them down over a thousand years, like boiling a frog in warm water.

And now, Lu Yang had used this move on Subduing Dragon Arhat!

The next second, Subduing Dragon Arhat suddenly recoiled a step. The scene of the [Subduing Dragon Temple] appeared behind him, but the Buddha’s light within the temple abruptly dimmed. Until the Buddha’s light completely vanished, the [Subduing Dragon Temple] then developed countless cracks, and subsequently exploded!

Subduing Dragon Arhat’s eyes were about to burst from rage. Although he was not physically injured, two lines of blood tears still streamed from his eyes: “My merit, my fortune, all gone!?”

Honestly, it would have been better to be injured! After all, injuries could heal. Backed by the Buddhist Pure Land, he had plenty of ways to resolve them. Even if his injuries were fatal and he died, he could still be reborn into a good life. Even after reincarnation, there would still be hope of re-ascending the path of immortality.

However, with his merit and fortune gone, when his lifespan in this current life came to an end, he might not even be able to be reborn as a human. He would have to live ten generations as pigs and dogs just to have a chance of repaying this karmic debt!

One must know that a Foundation Establishment True Person can at most reincarnate five times!

Ten generations as pigs and dogs virtually equated to a death sentence for a Foundation Establishment True Person. Subduing Dragon Arhat was currently in his prime; how could he accept such a result?

“Why? Why is it like this!?”

Amidst his rage, Subduing Dragon Arhat was also filled with confusion: “For the karmic debt of destroying an earth-vein, I was at most a catalyst. You are the true instigator!”

The Heavenly Dao is utterly impartial. If he were to be reborn as pigs and dogs for ten generations due to this karmic debt, then Lu Yang would be unable to repay it even in a hundred or a thousand generations. Even if he did manage to repay it and be reborn as a human, he would inevitably suffer hardship for half a lifetime. Forget about ascending the immortal path, even seeking wealth and prestige would be as hard as ascending to the heavens.

This was simply killing a thousand enemies while incurring ten thousand self-inflicted wounds!

Upon thinking of this, Subduing Dragon Arhat almost vomited blood again from sheer anger.

“If we could perish together, why the hell didn’t you say so earlier? We could have talked! If I had known you had such a trump card, why would I have been so aggressive?”

“Beast! You beast!”

“Heh.”

Watching Subduing Dragon Arhat, who had completely lost his composure and was cursing furiously, Lu Yang merely sneered. Karmic debt? What karmic debt did he have? After restarting, everything would naturally reset to zero!

“This time, I’m just collecting a bit of interest.”

Lu Yang stared fixedly at Subduing Dragon Arhat. Although the merit bomb of self-detonating the earth-veins would leave deep and lasting harm, its direct power could not wound Subduing Dragon Arhat in the slightest.

However, there was not a hint of dejection in his heart; instead, his fighting spirit was soaring. Even if his Foundation Establishment failed this time, at least he had seen clearly the hidden dangers in his cultivation method. In the next life, he could calmly make arrangements, or even turn the tables and give Subduing Dragon Arhat a truly harsh blow!

Cultivating immortality is difficult, more difficult than ascending to the heavens. He might not be the one who smiles the best.

But with the [Book of Hundred Lives], the one who laughs last will definitely be him!

“Next life, I will kill you!”

As his words fell, Lu Yang resolutely self-detonated. His originally clear consciousness immediately plunged into obscurity, and in the boundless darkness, only a clear lingering sound remained:

“Book of Hundred Lives!”
