# Chapter 37: Inventory Check

About twenty li from the Black River Market, in a hidden river cave.

This place required diving into the river first, then navigating through an underwater passage that led to a dark, damp, and musty cave devoid of water. 

Without proper bedding arrangements, this place was hardly suitable for any clandestine activities. It was a hideout the original owner of this body had stumbled upon while evading danger in the past.

At this moment, Wang Chan was quietly reflecting on the recent battle.

Based on his current understanding, a cultivator's combat prowess could be divided into three aspects.

First was spiritual power. 

The more abundant one's spiritual power, the more spells they could cast. Additionally, the stronger the attributes of their spiritual power, the greater the potency boost when casting corresponding elemental spells.

Second were spells, divine abilities, magical artifacts, talismans, and similar tools.

Taking magical artifacts as an example, mid-grade spells were stronger than low-grade ones. For spells of the same grade, those with more layers of restrictions packed greater power. The same principle applied to divine abilities and magical artifacts.

Third was combat experience, which was equally important but required accumulation through repeated battles to refine.

Considering these three aspects, within the same major cultivation realm, if two cultivators clashed head-on, the one with higher-grade artifacts or spells and more restrictions would generally have the upper hand.

Historical records even mentioned a case where an early Qi Refinement cultivator, wielding a top-grade artifact at full restriction capacity, managed to instantly kill an overconfident late Qi Refinement cultivator. 

Of course, such scenarios were rare—after all, top-grade artifacts were things most cultivators would never lay eyes on in their lifetime.

Moreover, when it came to differences between major realms, the outcome was practically predetermined. Under normal circumstances, a Foundation Establishment cultivator could effortlessly suppress a Qi Refinement cultivator—it was sheer domination.

"My current combat strength places me among the elite of early Qi Refinement cultivators. I might even hold my own against mid-stage Qi Refinement opponents. However, due to my limited spiritual power reserves, I can't sustain prolonged battles. My best strategy is to strike first with surprise attacks, catching opponents off guard..."

"For instance, those bald cultivators had mid-grade protective talismans, but they didn't anticipate my white needles carrying lightning energy—exceptionally effective at breaking defenses—while my black needles, formless and traceless, excel at ambushes. That's how I succeeded."

"Had their defensive talismans been slightly stronger, preventing my white needles from piercing through in one strike, I would've had to use [Dragon's Vigor, Tiger's Ferocity] to escape rather than charging in to kill that voluptuous female cultivator."

"[Dragon's Vigor, Tiger's Ferocity] is devastating in close combat. Any Qi Refinement cultivator at my level caught in melee without solid defenses would be pummeled to death by my fists."

After his reflections, Wang Chan quietly began inventorying the spoils of battle, manipulating items solely with spiritual energy-formed hands to avoid making noticeable sounds. 

Simultaneously, his spiritual sense enveloped the cave entrance, ready to react to any disturbances like rippling water or swaying aquatic plants. 

Though this place was extremely secluded, what if some idle cultivator decided to come here to relieve themselves? These items absolutely couldn't be seen by others.

Especially that green-robed female cultivator's storage pouch—it contained numerous valuable items. Aside from the scattered paired flying daggers found in the other three storage pouches, there was also a bamboo leaf flying artifact, a mid-grade defensive pendant... 

Just thinking about them made his eyes gleam with greed.

Yet Wang Chan hesitated. 

The previous incident with the demon bone served as a cautionary tale. 

Though Madam Cheng was slippery, she had genuinely offered well-intentioned advice and provided purification and aura-concealing talismans. 

Had it not been for that, instead of Chen Fengshuang's spiritual wine during that barbecue night, he might have been greeted by her flashing blades.

Considering the green-robed woman's claim of being Wei Jing, a direct descendant of the Wei family, he had to be extremely cautious.

If her claim was true, her background was indeed extraordinary. 

The Wei family was a Foundation Establishment clan not inferior to the Bai family—they might possess tracking methods similar to the Autumn Wind Cicada.

His initial impulse was to toss the storage pouch into the river, eliminating the problem entirely. 

But he restrained himself.

After careful consideration, he decided to place the pouch in a jade box, then use a minor earth traversal talisman to bury it over ten zhang deep beneath the river cave. 

When circumstances were safer and more appropriate, he could return to retrieve it.

This location was utterly ordinary and buried deep underground—exceptionally concealed.

This way, he wouldn't have to worry about losing it. 

If it still went missing under these conditions, he could only blame his luck, as it would most likely mean the Wei family had tracked him down.

In any case, personal safety was paramount—no amount of caution was excessive.

However, before burying the green-robed woman's storage pouch, he couldn't resist examining its contents—it would be too frustrating otherwise.

Retracting his silver needles, he emptied the green-robed female cultivator's storage pouch, piling the items on the ground.

A low-grade bamboo leaf flying artifact with about ten restrictions. 

A damaged low-grade robe with roughly eight restrictions. 

A mid-grade white jade pendant, a defensive artifact with seventeen mid-grade restrictions. 

One mid-grade talisman. 

Four low-grade talismans. 

212 spirit coins. 

143 spirit pearls. 

Over a dozen sets of spiritual garments, shoes, undergarments, and breast wraps...

As he was merrily sorting through the items, Wang Chan's gaze suddenly sharpened, landing on a jade slip on the ground.

*"Cultivation Notes of Silent Fairy."*

Huh... a cultivation diary?

Wang Chan immediately opened it and began reading with great interest.

After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea...

Wang Chan leisurely placed the jade slip back on the ground, sat down comfortably, and happily took out a bottle of [Spirit Nourishing Elixir], drinking it like spiritual spring water to quench his thirst.

Though consuming elixir this way was somewhat wasteful, at this moment... he felt like splurging.

Because the green-robed female cultivator wasn't Wei Jing at all—her name was Chen Jing.

She wasn't a direct descendant of the Foundation Establishment Wei family but rather came from a relatively prominent Qi Refinement family in the Blackwater City region.

However, Chen Jing was now a rogue cultivator. 

Her family had collapsed during their southward migration to the White Mountain region, with casualties ranging from the late Qi Refinement clan leader to infants yet to begin cultivation—nearly all perished.

She had only managed to reach the White Mountain region thanks to the genuine Wei Jing, who had kindly helped her.

Since arriving in the White Mountain region, though she hadn't become a bandit cultivator, she had committed numerous misdeeds—specializing in trafficking female cultivators to serve as cultivation cauldrons for dual cultivation, using the profits to fund her own practice.

Thus, this woman was far from some naive young mistress. 

Wang Chan could even guess most of her motives for this recent "heroic intervention."

Years ago, she had suffered assault by male cultivators, with bystanders who did nothing to help...

This left her hating not only male cultivators who violated women but even more so those who stood by and watched.

So when she saw the voluptuous female cultivator being violated, she couldn't restrain herself. Noticing the woman's attractive figure—which could fetch a good price—and confident in her own abilities, she decided to intervene.

Had she succeeded, Wang Chan would have undoubtedly been her next target.

But this habitual hunter had finally been out-hunted, meeting her match in the ruthless bald bandit cultivators and capsizing in a tiny ditch.

"The human heart is more sinister than ghosts," Wang Chan murmured, recalling the earlier events with a sigh, then couldn't help but scoff. "Who keeps a diary like some upstanding citizen anyway?"

With a flick of his sleeve, he reduced the jade slip to fragments, scattering them into the river.

Standing up and dusting himself off, Wang Chan discarded all hesitation, methodically organizing the green-robed woman's belongings into his own storage pouch.

As for the three bald cultivators—being bandits with no affiliations—he had even fewer qualms about handling their storage pouches.

He emptied their pouches, forming three small piles, then continued sorting with spiritual energy-formed hands.

Commonplace items like clothes, shoes, and towels were pulverized with spiritual energy, to be disposed of in the river later. More valuable items were set aside for reorganization.

Suddenly, his hand closed around a familiar-looking object—a phallus carved from crimson fire jade, undoubtedly belonging to the voluptuous female cultivator, faintly emitting a musky scent.

"Given her seemingly insatiable appearance, why'd she pick such a modest size?" Wang Chan thought disdainfully, nearly crushing it with the other trash.

But considering it was made of valuable crimson fire jade—worth at least three to five spirit coins—he reluctantly stored it in a jade box for later resale.

Washing it was out of the question—some buyers might prefer it with character, possibly increasing its value by another coin.

Soon, the sorting was complete.

First, the artifacts:

A shield with sixteen restrictions. 

A red trident with nineteen restrictions. 

A slender red needle with eleven restrictions. 

A white mask at full twenty-four restrictions.

Surprisingly, the latter two belonged to the voluptuous female cultivator—she had been the wealthiest of the trio. 

Upon reflection, this made sense. Compared to the fierce-looking bald man, she had been the truly ruthless one.

Standard low-grade artifacts typically started at three hundred spirit coins, with each additional restriction adding thirty coins. After accounting for various factors, selling these four items would net him at least three thousand spirit coins!

"I've struck gold!" Wang Chan couldn't help but grin widely.
