## Chapter 75: Assessment Mission

The Limitless Dao Sect has clear rewards and punishments and values talent. Becoming a True Disciple truly signifies a rapid ascent, like a dragon transforming in a storm, soaring to the heavens—there could be no greater opportunity in life.

Yang Ji had read in a book that there was a True Disciple in the Limitless Dao Sect named Hao Yun. This person possessed immense fortune; he could pick up a treasure artifact just by walking out the door, kick a random stone and unearth profound jade, or simply stroll around and discover sacred medicine. Visiting secret realms or immortal dwellings always led to inheriting legacies left by Mahayana cultivators. Such an individual was truly a legendary figure, a Heaven's Favored Son of this era blessed with immense fortune. With luck following him everywhere, it would be difficult for him *not* to achieve something.

Yang Ji couldn't help but feel a little emotional. So far, he had only received the legacy left by Senior Fu Dongliu. He wondered if that counted as being blessed with immense fortune. He didn't know, so he continued reading. He also learned that those of their current status didn't even qualify to wear sect robes, nor were there any initiation ceremonies. This was because they were still in the assessment stage; only by passing the first assessment would they be granted the basic rights and resources of the sect.

After a general read-through of *The Limitless Dao Sect*, Yang Ji then began flipping through *The Cultivation World*. This book chronicled various aspects of the cultivation world, covering everything from astronomy to geography, human nature to profound mysteries. Secret realms, factions, regions, and races were all discussed.

As he turned the pages, Yang Ji discovered that the world he currently inhabited was called Grand Beginning. Such a primordial great world was incredibly vast, absurdly so. Even a Nascent Soul True Monarch continuously teleporting and flying would never reach its end in a lifetime. And in this heaven and earth, there were actually two thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine other naturally formed primordial great cultivation worlds like this one. As for the other minor cultivation worlds, they were simply countless.

Beyond this, in the boundless outer starry sky, there were also extremely flourishing cultivation civilizations on various stars. Moreover, in the outer void, countless mighty experts had opened up large and small cultivation worlds, truly fantastical and diverse. Indeed, cultivation was not confined to a single corner; the flame of longevity spanned heaven and earth. Yang Ji now realized how narrow his vision had been before, and how bizarre, wondrous, and colorful this world truly was.

"Outer starry sky? Primordial great worlds? Minor worlds? Worlds opened by mighty experts? If I get the chance, I'll go see them," Yang Ji murmured softly. As he continued reading, he learned more: this heaven and earth was not only inhabited by the Human and Demonic races but also by myriad other races. In their great world, humans held the dominant position, with other races being weaker, but in other great worlds, it was different.

The outer void was the domain of Heavenly Demons, and the dominant races in other great worlds included the God Race, Saint Race, Spirit Race, Dragon Race, Battle Race, and so on. Upon reading this, Yang Ji couldn't help but feel a sudden realization: the Human Race was merely a flicker of flame in the great fire of cultivation civilization. The thought of those powerful experts roaming freely across various worlds, living lives of complete freedom, made his heart pound with excitement.

"The world is so beautiful; if one does not attain longevity, how can one witness all this grand scenery?" A brilliant fire ignited in Yang Ji's eyes. All of this had completely opened his vision, making his desire for longevity even firmer.

Yang Ji continuously absorbed the knowledge from the books, spending a whole month doing so. It was after this month that his Dao Sect token suddenly vibrated, emitting a circle of spiritual light.

"It's finally here!" Yang Ji's expression grew solemn, knowing that the sect had sent an assessment mission. He picked up the token and saw several lines of small text displayed within.

`Name: Yang Ji. Strength: Peak Golden Core. Assessment Mission: According to intelligence, demonic cultivators are committing evil in Eight Profundities City, a million miles from the Dao Sect. They are using cultivators as nutrients to cultivate evil sacred medicine. Take on this mission and eliminate the leader of evil.`

`Note: Eight Profundities City has eight City Lords, all Peak Golden Core cultivators. In addition to you, seven other Peak Golden Core cultivators from this sect have taken on this mission. You must bring back the head of one evil-doer to pass the assessment.`

"Seven other people are taking on the same mission as me? Eight against eight? The first assessment shouldn't be too difficult, I imagine."

As Yang Ji pondered, he abruptly stood up. With his perfected grand divine ability, he possessed formidable strength capable of slaying ordinary Nascent Soul True Monarchs. Dealing with the Golden Core True Persons in a rogue cultivator city like this would be more than enough. However, to leave nothing to chance, he still thought about discussing it with the other seven. But he didn't know who the other seven were or how to contact them, which was indeed a problem.

After a moment of thought, Yang Ji abandoned the idea of immediate contact. Although he couldn't reach them for now, they all had the same destination: Eight Profundities City. With the Dao Sect tokens, they would be able to sense each other's tokens within a certain range. Once they reached Eight Profundities City, everything would be clear at a glance.

Thinking this, Yang Ji used his Dao Sect token to leave his room, then flew towards the grand teleportation hall outside. After several days and multiple transfers, Yang Ji finally arrived at Eight Profundities City, a million miles away. Eight Profundities City was enormous, with a permanent population exceeding ten million, making it one of the largest forces in the region. The main roads within the city were wide, with ample space for eighteen carriages to travel abreast.

The city was bustling with activity; shops lined both sides, traffic flowed ceaselessly, and people bustled through the streets. Yang Ji concealed his aura and slowly moved through the crowd. Holding his Dao Sect token, he secretly sensed his surroundings. Before long, he discovered five Dao Sect disciples inside the City Lord's Mansion.

Yang Ji was surprised. Had these five already begun their operation? Cultivators who reached their level of cultivation should not be so reckless. Charging directly into the City Lord's Mansion without waiting for everyone else—were they that fierce?

Puzzled, Yang Ji went to the front of the City Lord's Mansion and observed from afar, noticing that the guards' expressions were normal, clearly indicating that no battle had occurred inside. Furthermore, the commotion caused by a Golden Core True Person's battle would be immense; he couldn't possibly have failed to sense it.

As he watched, Yang Ji saw many dust-covered cultivators entering the City Lord's Mansion one after another, each seemingly with a purpose. After inquiring, he learned that the City Lord's Mansion was holding an auction recently. There was no need for an entry token or anything of the sort; anyone above the Foundation Establishment realm could participate.

Yang Ji instantly understood. The five Dao Sect disciples must have snuck in this way, biding their time inside. Thus, Yang Ji quietly walked towards the City Lord's Mansion as well, intentionally releasing a powerful late-Foundation Establishment aura as he approached. Immediately, the two Qi Condensation guards at the City Lord's Mansion front gate hurried forward with smiles. "Sir, are you here to participate in the auction?"

"Precisely!" Yang Ji nodded.

"Sir, please come in quickly." The two guards stepped aside, respectfully gesturing for Yang Ji to enter. Yang Ji nodded and walked straight inside.

The City Lord's Mansion was ancient and elegant, and the flowers and plants were exceptionally beautiful. As soon as Yang Ji entered, a maidservant came forward to greet him. "Sir, please follow me," the comely young woman said, leading the way while speaking sideways. "Guests attending the auction are all staying in the Sleeping Immortal Pavilion to the east. In three days, someone will naturally escort you to the auction."

"Hm." Yang Ji feigned a profound demeanor and nodded.

Inside the City Lord's Mansion, the ground was entirely paved with azure-patterned stone. Along the way, various exotic flowers and lush vegetation thrived. Luminous pearls were embedded everywhere on the courtyard walls, suggesting it must be beautiful at night. The two walked for a while before arriving in front of a grand and magnificent pavilion.

"This is the Sleeping Immortal Pavilion," the maidservant said from the front.

"The environment here is quite good." Yang Ji smiled as he glanced around. The exotic flowers and serene environment indeed seemed very comfortable.

"The City Lord released news of the auction, and experts from various regions have been arriving continuously during this period. The Sleeping Immortal Pavilion is specially prepared for distinguished guests."

The maidservant smiled, leading Yang Ji to a room on the first floor. "Sir, this is your room. If you have any other needs, please just let us know."

"Nothing I need. You may go," Yang Ji said indifferently to the young woman.

Just then, with a creaking sound, the door of the room opposite opened, revealing a "familiar" person to Yang Ji: the girl in combat attire. Perhaps sensing the Dao Sect token, the doors on the second and third floors of the Sleeping Immortal Pavilion opened one after another. The people inside were either an old man, a young man, or a middle-aged man; without exception, these four all had Dao Sect tokens on them, which Yang Ji could sense.

The few of them exchanged glances and nodded knowingly, acknowledging each other. They all understood their purpose for coming this time, and a single look confirmed they were on the same side.

"It's this guy; he's on the same mission as me. I hope he doesn't hold us back," the girl in combat attire frowned, glancing at Yang Ji before closing her door. The others also nodded at Yang Ji in greeting before closing their doors. Yang Ji glanced at the girl in combat attire's room with surprise. He truly hadn't expected to meet her here again. His eyes shifted slightly, he looked at the opposite room, then turned and entered his own.

One day quickly passed, and the remaining two Dao Sect disciples also arrived. Everyone was intelligent, having used the auction opportunity to sneak in. They would strategize before acting. For the remaining two days, everyone secretly communicated and exchanged information, unifying their plan of action: they would act according to the situation, waiting until the City Lord appeared at the auction before making their move.

...

Three days passed, and finally, it was the day of the auction. A maidservant arrived and led Yang Ji to a large reception hall. As Yang Ji entered the hall, he immediately saw a white-haired old man. The old man also nodded slightly upon seeing Yang Ji.

"Sir, please find any seat. Once everyone has arrived, the City Lords will come to inform you about the auction details," the maidservant said. Yang Ji nodded and took a seat.

Just then, another person entered from outside the hall: the gloomy young man he had met earlier. The gloomy young man swept his gaze around, also seeing the white-haired old man and Yang Ji. He nodded slightly at the two and casually found a seat. Before long, the girl in combat attire, the black-haired old man, the refined middle-aged man, the smiling young man, and the burly man, a total of five, all arrived.

In addition to Yang Ji and the other seven, dozens of other cultivators also arrived, their strengths ranging from early Foundation Establishment to late Golden Core. Yang Ji and the others had also concealed their cultivation, suppressing it all to the Foundation Establishment realm, not revealing their true strength and appearing no different from ordinary people.

Everyone was now gathered in the reception hall, drinking tea, chatting idly, and waiting quietly.

"Haha, everyone's here, aren't they?" Suddenly, a laugh came from outside, and a black-robed old man with a skeletal face walked in. Yang Ji's gaze swept over him, discovering that this person was a Peak Golden Core cultivator. The newcomer must be one of the eight City Lords. Indeed, his words confirmed Yang Ji's guess.

"Haha, I am Guixiao, the Seventh City Lord of Eight Profundities City. I apologize for keeping you distinguished guests waiting." The black-robed old man walked steadily and with an extraordinary demeanor, clearly having held power for many years.

"City Lord!" Many cultivators recognized him and greeted him with smiles.

"I believe everyone is impatient. I won't waste any more words. Please follow me now to the palace below to participate in the auction," Guixiao said. Everyone looked at him without speaking. Guixiao smiled, lightly stomped his right foot, and immediately, a secret passage leading underground appeared in the hall.

Guixiao was the first to descend the secret passage. Everyone exchanged glances and followed closely behind.

"Everyone, what do you say?" the white-haired old man suddenly asked via spiritual transmission.

"I know a bit about Eight Profundities City. Although the eight City Lords are all Peak Golden Core, their strength isn't that great. If we eight work together, we can easily pass this assessment," the gloomy young man transmitted.

"Last night, I secretly used a soul-bewitching spell to interrogate a guard and learned that the eight City Lords of Eight Profundities City take turns on duty. The other seven City Lords are all in this underground palace. If my assumption is correct, they should be cultivating that so-called evil sacred medicine there," the refined middle-aged man transmitted.

"Everyone, what do you say, are we going down?" the smiling young man inquired via transmission.

"What do you think?" The girl in combat attire, seeing Yang Ji staring at the secret passage below, suddenly sought his opinion.

"Since below is their lair, it should be set up with killing arrays and other dangers. As for the eight City Lords, I think our eight people working together should be enough to kill them," Yang Ji withdrew his gaze and slowly transmitted.

"In that case, let's go down and capture them all in one fell swoop," the white-haired old man said.

"In any case, just be careful and be prepared to deal with danger at any time," Yang Ji knew that this was not an auction at all; going down would lead to a slaughter. This was because he had just seen `[Insidious]` and `[Blood-sacrificing Sacred Medicine]` information above Guixiao's head. Below the secret passage, he also saw information displayed for `[Killing Arrays]`. Those killing arrays were lethal to ordinary Golden Core True Persons, but for people like them, they posed little problem. Besides the killing arrays, Yang Ji also saw information displayed for some individuals: seven Peak Golden Core cultivators, who must be the other seven City Lords.

As for the cultivators below Golden Core, there were some, but they were not worth mentioning. With everything seen through, Yang Ji felt more confident. He then descended into the secret passage with the others. Yang Ji and the other seven walked at the very back, maintaining their vigilance.

"Hm, a scent of blood? An extremely faint scent of blood."

The girl in combat attire suddenly frowned slightly, looking ahead. Then, she looked at the other Dao Sect disciples around her; their eyes showed no unusual expression. Only Yang Ji's expression froze slightly. Through an inexplicable sensation, their eyes met, and their gazes quickly exchanged information. Both read the information within and became even more cautious as they walked, slowly falling to the back of the group. At the same time, Yang Ji also transmitted a message to the other Dao Sect members, telling them to strengthen their defenses.

...

In the deepest part of the underground palace, there was a secret chamber. The walls here were entirely red, as if stained red with the blood of countless living beings. The walls were covered with strange patterns that intertwined, forming ferocious and terrifying strange beasts.

On the wall directly in front of the secret chamber was a giant spiritual mirror. Inside the mirror, Yang Ji and his group were slowly advancing.

"My Lord, are you satisfied with this batch of nourishment?" The middle-aged man spoke, his face fawning as he looked at the seven figures sitting cross-legged behind him.

These seven figures included a silent, bloodthirsty man, an old woman who dabbled in poisons, a handsome young man, a middle-aged man who manipulated flying needles, a short, fierce-looking man, an enchanting woman holding a flute, a decisive man with a murderous look, and a barefoot, cute and naive little girl. These seven had different appearances and vastly different personalities, yet sitting together, they did not feel out of place; instead, there was a strange harmony.
