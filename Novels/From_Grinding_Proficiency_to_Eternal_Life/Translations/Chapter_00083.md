# Chapter 83: Bone Training Like a Cicada's Song

The man whom Liu Tianyu had described as a Blood Transformation Realm expert was now huddled in a wheelchair. Below his right knee was wrapped in tiger fur, the festering wound exuding the stench of rotting flesh.

"The disciple recommended by Liu Tianyun?"

He extended his remaining three fingers, his sallow fingernails scraping across the Blood Cicada Token.

"What else did that traitorous dog have to say?"

A traitor?!

Xu Yunfan felt a suffocating pressure in his chest. Had Liu Tianyun pushed him into a pit of fire?

Seeing Xu Yunfan's expression change, Lin Hanyi whispered, "Master and Martial Uncle have never gotten along, so he always speaks like this..."

Xu Yunfan's expression improved significantly. After thinking for a moment, he replied, "Liu... he is now only at the First Stage of Martial Master."

"First Stage of Martial Master?"

Chen Tiangang fell silent for a moment, then suddenly burst into laughter. The sound waves shook the entire hall, causing dust to fall.

After a long while, he slowly stopped, letting out an inexplicable sigh as he looked Xu Yunfan up and down.

Suddenly, his eyes widened. His hand lightly slapped the armrest, and his body, previously hunched in the wheelchair, shot forward explosively.

Chen Tiangang stood before Xu Yunfan, leaning on his cane. He reached out his hand, continuously pressing and probing Xu Yunfan's muscles and bones.

Xu Yunfan's face tightened, his body stiffening. If he hadn't reacted in time, he almost would have smashed his hammer down.

"Muscles like twisted silk, bones like refined steel. A fine specimen! He's actually a Third Stage of Martial Master!"

The old Sect Master laughed heartily, a hint of joy on his face. "That old dog actually did a good deed before he died."

He looked directly into Xu Yunfan's eyes. "Do you truly wish to join the Cicada Gate?"

Xu Yunfan met his gaze without fear, calm and composed. He bowed slightly and cupped his fists. "Naturally, I wish to join the Cicada Gate."

Chen Tiangang nodded slightly. After a moment of contemplation, he said slowly, "Rest assured, the entire Thunder Accumulation Mountain falls within the Cicada Gate's domain. Although it may appear somewhat dilapidated and simple, the mountain has ten thousand mu of land at its base, six thousand tenant farmers, and eight hundred miscellaneous servants and outer disciples. There are twenty-three inner disciples. For a true disciple, food, clothing, and expenses will naturally be lacking nothing, and medicinal pills for assistance will not be short. You can practice peacefully. However, as a disciple of the Cicada Gate, every three months, you must perform a task for the sect. Can you accept this?"

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate for a moment. He knelt on the ground and kowtowed three times with a thud.

"Master, please accept your disciple's bow!"

Chen Tiangang was overjoyed, cackling with laughter.

"Hanyi, bring the *Cicada Vitality Manual*. Today, I shall expound the scriptures for your Sixth Martial Brother!"

*Crash!*

Hearing his junior sister, Chu Xuan, say that Chen Tiangang was going to expound the scriptures for Xu Yunfan, Ning Wuque's jade cup was crushed in his hand.

A smile still lingered on his lips, but his eyes were filled with icy coldness.

"Junior Sister, do not eavesdrop when Master is transmitting his teachings to others."

Hearing her Senior Brother Ning Wuque's gentle words, Chu Xuan said somewhat unconvinced, "Master is being biased. That big guy is just a Third Stage of Martial Master. Senior Brother is also a Third Stage master with perfected muscle, bone, and skin cultivation. In terms of appearance... he's way more handsome than him."

Ning Wuque's eyes flashed. The side profile of his face revealed a clear jawline, making Chu Xuan's eyes shine as she looked at him.

"Junior Sister, attacking others' appearances is not polite."

"Senior Brother is the best, kind and upright. That big guy looks like a dull person, and carrying such a heavy hammer, he must be full of bad ideas."

Inside the Ancestral Hall.

When the silk cloth inscribed with the *Cicada Vitality Manual* was unfurled, Chen Tiangang's severed leg stomped heavily on the ground. The steel skeleton hidden within his prosthetic shattered the floor tiles, allowing him to stand steadily on his残肢.

"Watch closely!"

The old Sect Master's spine suddenly emitted a sound like a bowstring vibrating. His hunched body straightened section by section. When the seventh vertebra protruded like a blade, his missing right arm turned into a phantom, and the bronze bell five steps away exploded with a bang.

Flying fragments embedded themselves into the beams and pillars, the cross-sections retaining spiral patterns. This was destructive power generated purely by muscle vibration.

"The *Cicada Vitality Manual* cultivates muscles, bones, and skin simultaneously, and all can be perfected. However, bone training is the most important. By using the bones to push and vibrate, layer by layer, one can easily pierce through gold and stone. If you have the chance to reach perfection, your bones will be as hard as refined steel and as tough as raw jade, reaching an inconceivable level of power. Furthermore, it can integrate the Three Stages, refining them into one. This lays the foundation for the External Three Unions. Cultivating the method of the External Three Unions will naturally come with ease. After breaking through the External Three Unions, you can cultivate the Cicada Gate's true core secret technique, the Hardened Body True Art, the Cicada Armor."

Chen Tiangang tore his sleeve, revealing the writhing muscle fibers on his arm.

"Integrate the Three Stages. Every inch of flesh can store power. When cultivated to the extreme, exhaling is like an arrow, stomping can crack stones. Every movement possesses the power to tear dragons and tigers apart."

He suddenly grabbed Xu Yunfan's throat, his thumb pressing below the Adam's apple.

"Can you hold your breath? Hmm? You've cultivated a Hardened Body technique? Good, very good. You are perfectly suited for my Cicada Gate!"

Xu Yunfan's entire body tensed. He almost pulled out his gilded mace to swing it.

The moment intense pain exploded in his trachea, Xu Yunfan instinctively contracted his chest and abdominal muscles.

Chen Tiangang's manic laughter rang out in his ear.

"Yes! Treat every piece of flesh as a bowstring! Contract the intercostal muscles by three-tenths! Press the diaphragm down another inch!"

"..."

For the next nearly month, Xu Yunfan immersed himself in cultivating the *Cicada Vitality Manual*. The original Iron Bridge Town's Bone Training technique was gradually integrated by the *Cicada Vitality Manual*.

Until today, Xu Yunfan, who had always kept an iron box by his side, stripped to the waist. As he threw a punch, it was clearly visible that his arm suddenly elongated by a section.

The muscles on his back coiled like dragons, sweat droplets rolling down his bronze-colored back muscles.

A dense bone cry suddenly sounded from his right arm. The entire arm bone seemed to be a living thing, advancing section by section. When his fist whistled through the air, it brought forth a sharp shriek. This was the *Cicada Vitality Manual* integrating the bones of his entire body, a unique method of exerting force after reaching the入门 (Initial) stage.

*Bang!*

The sound of bones colliding was as clear as jade beads exploding at this moment, accompanied by the speed of the punch increasing by several degrees.

The wooden stake three steps away shattered with a sound. Amidst the fragments, the edge of the fist print was left with fine, vibrating patterns.

Xu Yunfan retracted his stance and exhaled. Dark red blood lines appeared faintly beneath his skin like hidden snakes. This was the sign of pushing the Iron Bridge Town's Bone Training technique to its limit.

The Iron Bridge Town's Bone Training chapter unexpectedly fit well with the *Cicada Vitality Manual*. Or rather, the *Cicada Vitality Manual* was like a furnace. No matter what kind of bone training technique was cultivated, the *Cicada Vitality Manual* could still refine it into one like a great cauldron.

To have ranked among the top sects back then, it truly had depth. The efficiency of this technique in training bones was far superior to the Iron Bridge Town's method.

[The *Cicada Vitality Manual* you are cultivating has reached the Initial stage.]

[Cicada Vitality Manual 0/500 (Initial)]

[Special Effect: Bone power slightly gathers, nourishes bones and generates breath, relaxes tendons and bones, initial comprehension of bone power, bones tremble like mosquitoes, using bones to lead tendons]

In an instant, wisps of warm currents, like ants, crawled over every bone in his body. The incredibly itchy sensation made Xu Yunfan's face twitch slightly.

The memories rising in his mind were just like the past month: applying secret medicine to his entire body daily, soaking in bone-training medicinal baths, consuming the medicinal power while cultivating the *Cicada Vitality Manual* to penetrate deep into his bones.

However, this process was extended by a full two and a half years. Compared to Ning Wuque, who reached the Initial stage in just half a year, their aptitudes were truly worlds apart.
