Chapter 305: Tang Feng Dies, Jing Chun is Captured, Gathering at Feilong City, and Meeting Nianjun Again!

Jihui and Wang Long had followed their Master in practicing martial arts and the Dao since childhood. They knew well that Daoist Jing Chun had a tranquil and peaceful nature, rarely showing a trace of killing intent. Now, however, her killing intent was grim, and her first words were "leave none alive," which startled and terrified the two, causing their complexions to change and leaving them at a loss.

Wang Long was slightly older, while Jihui was the same age as Li Xian. Both were considered to have just stepped into the world. Wang Long couldn't help but ask, "Master, could you have misjudged the situation?"

Jihui had been verbally teased and was so angry she wanted to kill someone. But now her anger had dissipated. Hearing the command "leave none alive," she realized that if they made the slightest mistake, dozens of lives would be at stake. Ultimately, she was terrified and echoed, "Yes, it didn't seem like them to me either."

Daoist Jing Chun lowered her eyes to ponder. She was already eighty percent certain of the matter. Just now, the seven men had subtly formed a formation, creating a situation of encirclement. Jihui, with her shallow experience, had been in danger without realizing it. If Jing Chun hadn't出手 to save her, Jihui would have fallen into the enemy's hands. At that time, the enemy would have used Jihui to blackmail her, making it difficult for her to handle the situation. That was why she had acted quickly to bring her disciple back to her side.

However, this matter involved dozens of lives and required extreme caution. Even with a ninety percent certainty, she needed to investigate further. She said, "What you two said is not wrong. Wang Long, wait until late at night, then go downstairs to investigate. They look like they are disguised as traveling merchants. Secretly observe if they are truly conducting business. If they are, the goods, horses, personnel arrangements, and labor distribution will all be strictly divided. This cannot be faked."

"If they are indeed disciples of the Flower Cage Sect, we might even encounter the women they have captured. Our Jing Chun Mountain upholds the spirit of chivalry and justice. This is also a critical moment for the Five Great Sword Alliances, so we should promote the spirit of chivalry and save all who can be saved."

"You must be extremely careful in your actions " " Wang Master Master Wang, to ", you you, you you, Master.,, you " you. you,,,,,,, you, " you., " you,, ",, ".,,, you Wang to ", you,,, " ", " ", ",, ", " the you,,, the " " " ", ", " ",, the " " ",, you to " " you,,,, the " to the " " " " the, " ", the,, " to " the and, to " " " Long, you to, Wang Long, I, He, I, "师, " Master, Master, and, Master Long, " ", Jihui

 She Long Long, she, the two, not春道人, " is two were, " Master Long, and, "Master, I... I... I... I'm dead to die!"

Jihui said, "Stop mum nonsense, just serve the Master. This matter has nothing to do with you." The innkeeper said, "Who says it has nothing to do with me? I'm on the night shift tonight, and suddenly more than thirty people have died. You all can just leave潇洒ly tomorrow. These thirty or more corpses will definitely fall on my head. Lord He, the city lord, loves his people like his own children. Although he will investigate clearly, I will definitely be implicated. I... I'm definitely going to be beheaded!"

Daoist Jing Chun was slightly taken aback, not having thought of this point. She knew these people were Flower Cage bandits, nameless and unknown, and burying them on the spot would not be追究ed. But then she thought of something else and asked, "You said your Lord He loves his people like his own children? What kind of person is he?"

The innkeeper's eyes filled with admiration as he introduced Lord He's character again. Daoist Jing Chun thought to herself: "These bandits died easily. I killed them with a clear conscience. Why should I cover it up? Since Lord He is reasonable and upright, I should be able to explain it to him."

"It's better to stay here and wait for the officials to arrive."

She immediately said, "Alright, you write a letter to report to the authorities. I will stay here and wait for the people from the government to arrive. I will explain the whole story myself. It won't involve you."

Meanwhile, on the other side.

Li Xian had fled far away and was secretly relieved that no追兵 had come to kill him. It turned out that after seeing Jihui, Wang Long, and Daoist Jing Chun, Li Xian had felt a vague sense of unease. He ran to ask Tang Feng, "Elder Tang, how should we deal with these people?"

Tang Feng pondered: "If it were usual times, these送上门的娇花 (flowers delivered to the door), I would naturally find a way to take them. But... it's better not to cause trouble."

Li Xian knew that although Jihui was arrogant and自负, she could be considered righteous. He naturally didn't persuade Tang Feng to deal with the three of them. He thought that Tang Feng was well hidden, and they were indeed traveling as merchants. Although there had been a fight just now, they didn't use martial arts that would reveal their background, so perhaps they hadn't exposed any flaws.

If they were just casual acquaintances, it would be best to part ways here. So he followed the crowd to eat and drink, then returned to his room to rest. He knew the world of Jianghu was dangerous, and being in the Flower Cage Sect required extreme caution. The "Falling Hair Taking Root" served as an eye line, which could help him avoid enemies in advance.

So every time he arrived at a place, he would observe the environment and find a place to place his hair.

He thought: "If there is an accident, I need enough time to prepare." He carefully selected three key points to place his hair, then returned to bed to practice the Inner Transport of Viscera Turbidity, accumulating proficiency.

It proved to be effective. In the middle of the night, he suddenly saw the Master and two disciples walking lightly, seemingly towards the rooms nearby. Li Xian immediately felt something was wrong: "糟糕 (糟糕)! They must have discovered the Flower Cage bandits' identity!" He used his hair to observe closely and felt even more urgent: in a short while, the three people had entered and exited several rooms, and several people must have already been killed.

Li Xian forced himself to calm down, knowing he was in danger, and calmly weighed the pros and cons. Since Daoist Jing Chun could detect the Flower Cage Sect's identity, she must have had dealings with the Flower Cage Sect in the past, or even been extremely familiar with them. And she didn't kill Tang Feng but killed the ordinary disciples first, which was to avoid being surrounded by the formation.

Li Xian knew that even if he shouted now to gather everyone to resist, it would be too late. Everyone had been drinking and was in a daze, making it difficult to form a formation quickly. If he made a sound, he would definitely be killed by Daoist Jing Chun first.

At this time, he could only plan his own escape route and couldn't care about others. He used his dual-pupil透视 (透视) to observe the scenery outside the window and thought about an escape route. Outside the window was a flower bed, but the flowers were colorful and quite conspicuous. Escaping through the flower bed was clearly not a good strategy.

Li Xian suddenly thought: "Isn't this white snow my cover?" He immediately breathed out a clear breath. He used the Pure Gang Qi Armor to wrap himself, covering his entire body in white.

Then he used the essence of the "Breeze Leg" to silently push open the window. He used his hair to monitor the movements of the three people. Finding the right moment, he jumped into the snow. He immediately activated the "Pure Gang Qi Armor," covering the white snow and tightly wrapping his entire body.

He perfectly潜藏 (潜藏) in the snow.

Then he slowly crawled and escaped from the inn. After confirming he had gone far, he used the "Seven Star Step" and activated the "Light Word Jue" to escape quickly. He silently avoided the danger and protected his body.

Li Xian sighed: "I don't know how Elder Tang is. Alas, it's probably difficult for him. Walking in Jianghu, grudges and grievances... there's really no way around it."

He walked for several hours. The sky gradually brightened, and the night had passed. Li Xian thought of "Nan Gong Liu Li." He eventually had to return to the Flower Cage Sect. This trip had turned into a solo journey, and he still needed to go to Feilong City to investigate the location of "Morning Yellow Dew."

He traveled as usual, changing into a coarse linen garment and making his hair look messy. He walked like this for a day.

At noon the next day, Li Xian suddenly heard a few footsteps. He turned his head and saw it was the five people from the "Five Elements Flower Covering Formation."

Li Xian shouted, "Gold One!" The five people all looked over and said joyfully, "Brother Hua! You're not dead!"

Li Xian said, "Of course I'm not dead. What about you?" These five people no longer had names and were called "Gold One," "Fire Two," "Earth Three," "Water Four," and "Wood Five." Elder Tang Feng had made them lose their names so they would focus on studying the formation, and their names and titles were all related to the formation.

Gold One said, "Our five brothers were practicing the formation outside the inn. We studied until dawn. Suddenly, a group of soldiers arrived. We followed the soldiers back to the inn and found out that Elder Tang... and the other disciples were all dead! We didn't dare to make a sound."

Li Xian asked, "Soldiers?"

Gold One said, "Oh, it was the 'Flying Feather Young General Yang Xinqiang' from Feilong City. He brought iron chains and prison carriages and took the Master and two disciples who killed Elder Tang away."

Li Xian asked, "Oh?" Fire Two said, "They didn't resist. It's strange. Can Feilong City help us seek justice?"

Li Xian laughed, "Strange things keep happening. Feilong City is quite interesting. What do you five plan to do? Go back to the Water Altar or somewhere else?"

The five people looked at each other and said in unison, "Master Hua, we... we five want to follow you." Li Xian said frankly, "If you want to follow me, you must obey my every command and not cause me trouble. Otherwise, I will abandon you."

The five people looked at each other and said, "Okay! We will obey Master Hua's every command." Li Xian observed the faces of the five people, which were quite honest. They practiced martial arts and formations, hundreds of times more diligent than ordinary Flower Cage bandits, and were usually simple and quiet. He indeed had no bad feelings towards them.

Li Xian immediately found some clothes for the five people to change into. That evening, they finally arrived at Feilong City.

The city was magnificent, with the posture of a flying dragon coiling. As soon as they entered the city, they heard a storyteller in a tavern say:

"Speaking of Feilong City, the Yellow Dew appears, and the Human Yellow Essence Treasure is right nearby, but it sifts through the heroes of the world again and again."

"Speaking of the Worry-Free Building, enemies gather, and no one knows how many grudges and grievances are gone with the wind."

The marketplace was bustling.

Li Xian suddenly hid himself. He hadn't gone far into the city when he met an acquaintance. That figure in a purple skirt had an inescapable charm.
