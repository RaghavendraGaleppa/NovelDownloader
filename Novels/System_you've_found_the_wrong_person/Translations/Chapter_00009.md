# Chapter 9: Single-Handed Charge, Unstoppable  

**[Subdue Demons and Vanquish Evil]**: On the eighth day of the third month, you encountered two innate martial artists who relied on their skills to wreak havoc. One was adept at earth遁 (earth escape), vanishing underground and reappearing three steps to the east in an instant. He managed to deceive you, evading your first sword strike and forcing you to use a second. You sighed, realizing that the martial world was full of extraordinary talents and that your own cultivation still needed improvement.  

The other’s lightness skill was also noteworthy. Unfortunately, no matter how fast he flew, he couldn’t outpace your three-zhang (approx. 10 meters) sword aura. Feeling frustrated, you reflected that the *Triple Origin Qi Art* wasn’t renowned for its qi potency, yet now, with your growing strength, your sword aura spanned several zhang with ease, making it difficult to showcase the finesse of your swordsmanship.  

You couldn’t help but sigh—who would have guessed that the unremarkable Northern Ice Pearl in Black Eagle Venerable’s possession was actually a Millennial Earth Pearl?  

Later, when you visited your benefactor, Black Eagle Venerable, you learned that these two bandits were Earth Walker and Wind Wing.  

Recalling the past, Black Eagle Venerable mentioned how these two had lured the Black Horse Gang to ambush and test them. Waiting until they were exhausted, the bandits launched a sudden attack, nearly killing them.  

Especially the Black Horse Gang—they knew how to merge a hundred men into a single battle formation. If not for their lack of practice and the flaw in their northwestern formation, Black Eagle Venerable and Tang He would have perished that day. Black Eagle Venerable couldn’t help but reflect that guiding you onto the path of cultivation was the greatest achievement of his life.  

**[Reward for eliminating the local bandits: 30 days of cultivation!]**  

**[Task: (Completed!)]**  

---  

The next day, after waking up, Dou Changsheng habitually checked the **[Beautiful Life System]**. This time, after reading it, a realization dawned on him.  

He finally understood why the tasks always appeared as completed. The flow of time in the future wasn’t synchronized with his own. What seemed like a single night to him might have been much longer in the future. Thus, tasks would quickly transition from "incomplete" to "completed" shortly after appearing.  

Dou Changsheng carefully reviewed the task details again. That "Lucky Dou Changsheng" truly lived up to his name, having plundered the fortunes of countless brothers. While Dou Changsheng struggled to survive here, that guy had already been dealt a heavenly hand—starting with a renowned master, marrying into a prominent family after minimal effort, and then soaring to fame, competing with prodigies from four nations.  

The enemies Dou Changsheng now faced were mere trifles to Lucky Dou Changsheng—just a matter of one more or one less sword strike.  

Dou Changsheng’s expression darkened.  

That was his luck.  

His life.  

Forcing himself to ignore the bragging of Lucky Dou Changsheng, he focused on Earth Walker and Wind Wing.  

If these two had nearly killed Black Eagle Venerable and Tang He, they might be the enemies he’d face on his current path. He couldn’t be certain because he didn’t know whether Lucky Dou Changsheng’s timeline followed the swordsman’s route or Black Eagle Venerable’s.  

Wait—the swordsman’s timeline wasn’t dead.  

Since Lucky Dou Changsheng had intervened, and Black Eagle Venerable had saved Dou Changsheng, he wouldn’t have let the swordsman be killed by Wang Xiong either.  

Thus, they had still split into two groups.  

If he took the same path as Black Eagle Venerable’s future group this time, he’d face Earth Walker and Wind Wing.  

Dou Changsheng muttered their names a few times, then stood up, drew his sword, and began practicing. Preparation was always wise.  

After a long while, he wiped the sweat from his brow, took a few bites of dry rations, drank some water, retrieved his horse, and continued his journey.  

But his thoughts lingered on Black Eagle Venerable. Originally, Sword Gate Pass had been optional—now, it seemed unavoidable.  

This task’s information was invaluable.  

The Millennial Earth Pearl was something he’d heard of before—a legendary treasure that appeared repeatedly in tales.  

Every region had stories of a poor boy marrying a wealthy beauty and rising to greatness.  

A simple village youth, after accidentally consuming a Millennial Earth Pearl, gained immense inner qi, ventured into the martial world, and became a revered hero—a legend.  

Similar stories were countless, whether involving divine pills, magical weapons, or renowned masters. But the Millennial Earth Pearl was the most common "cheat," appearing far too often.  

It couldn’t be helped—its side effects were minimal, its effects immense, and it was naturally inconspicuous, unrecognizable except to those destined to find it.  

After a while, Dou Changsheng accepted reality.  

Compared to "Future Dou Changsheng," this lucky brother of his, the rest of the Dou Changshengs lived harsh lives.  

But at least he had it better—despite his streak of bad luck, he still possessed the **[Beautiful Life System]**. The others didn’t even have that. Weren’t their lives even harder?  

With that comparison, a sense of happiness and superiority emerged, soothing his bitterness.  

He claimed the task reward.  

As the thirty days of cultivation settled in, Dou Changsheng could clearly feel his innate qi expanding.  

Originally, his innate qi had been confined to his dantian, but now it overflowed into his meridians. While still within tolerable limits, the additional month’s worth of innate qi pushed him beyond his capacity.  

Under normal circumstances, this would have caused his body to explode.  

But since this came from the system, there were no issues. As his innate qi surged, filling his meridians to their limits, it automatically began breaking through barriers.  

For postcelestial martial artists, cultivation involved unlocking the Eight Extraordinary Meridians and Twelve Primary Meridians. Each opened meridian increased one’s qi.  

The Twelve Primary Meridians were divided into hand and foot categories, further split into yin and yang. Each category had three yang and three yin meridians, totaling twelve.  

The first to be impacted were the Three Hand Yang Meridians. Without Dou Changsheng’s control, his innate qi automatically broke through.  

The first meridian opened effortlessly, as did the second. In moments, all Three Hand Yang Meridians were unlocked.  

But this led to another development—as his meridians opened, his innate qi grew again, triggering further breakthroughs.  

By the time everything settled, all Three Hand Yang and Three Hand Yin Meridians had been unlocked.  

Half of the Twelve Primary Meridians were now open, leaving only the Three Leg Yang and Yin Meridians.  

And this was purely passive. If Dou Changsheng actively sought breakthroughs, the results would be even better.  

In short, unlocking these six meridians wasn’t even close to his limit. The reason was simple—ordinary martial artists broke through with postcelestial qi, while Dou Changsheng used innate qi, and high-quality innate qi at that.  

Suppressing his restless thoughts, Dou Changsheng reminded himself not to be reckless. These six meridians had been unlocked by the system, guaranteeing no issues.  

If he tried breaking through on his own, lacking proper techniques, he could damage his meridians, leaving lifelong regrets.  

Besides, riding on horseback was too unstable for cultivation.  

The qi gained from unlocking these meridians was minimal—fully unlocking the Twelve Primary Meridians would only increase his qi by a day or two.  

Yes, the disparity was that vast.  

For most martial artists, unlocking meridians led to massive qi surges and power boosts.  

But Dou Changsheng was an exception. The reason was simple—Future Dou Changsheng’s innate qi was too abundant. A month of his cultivation surpassed a year of Dou Changsheng’s own efforts.  

After learning that Future Dou Changsheng possessed the Millennial Earth Pearl, Dou Changsheng finally understood why a mere month’s worth of cultivation allowed him to unleash three-inch sword auras.  

He’d assumed all innate martial artists were this formidable, casually releasing sword auras at will.  

But now, recalling how Wang Xiong had been terrified by a three-inch sword aura, and how Zhao Manren and Ai Haike had fought without such displays—their innate qi remained within their weapons—he realized the truth.  

Only he, regardless of the situation, led with a three-inch sword aura.  

And he’d never felt his qi running low.  

This meridian breakthrough seemed to be the system’s solution to his overwhelming innate qi—unlocking a few meridians to accommodate the excess.  

He’d misunderstood.  

Turns out, he was already strong.  

Dou Changsheng had never had a clear grasp of his own strength.  

Now, knowing about the Millennial Earth Pearl, he was certain—his innate qi was exceptional even among innate martial artists.  

This was why Black Eagle Venerable never doubted whether he’d unlocked his meridians, and why Ai Haike had retreated upon recognizing him.  

With such potent innate qi, who’d believe he didn’t know swordsmanship?  

---  

For five days, the journey was uneventful. Dou Changsheng deliberately avoided populated areas—villages and towns were likely infested with enemy spies. It was better not to provoke them.  

His past life’s exposure to dramas hadn’t been in vain. Entering an inn for rest could lead to being drugged by the waiter.  

No matter how formidable one’s martial arts were, they couldn’t defend against endless schemes—waiters, passersby, merchants… anyone could be an enemy.  

Rather than spending the night in constant vigilance, it was better to avoid such places altogether.  

That night, as Dou Changsheng prepared to sleep outdoors again, he spotted figures on the distant plains.  

His gaze sharpened.  

A group of riders on black horses, brandishing curved blades, galloped toward him.  

Their attire and mounts immediately brought three words to mind:  

**Black Horse Gang.**  

It seemed his path truly aligned with Earth Walker and Wind Wing’s.  

The Black Horse Gang numbered around a hundred. Mounted on black steeds, their thunderous charge and roaring battle cries created the illusion of an army.  

Bathed in the crimson sunset, they surged forward.  

At the forefront was a silver-armored knight—tall, imposing, his eyes cold and ruthless beneath his helmet, exuding a cruel, bloodthirsty aura.  

As he charged, he slowly unsheathed his blade—two feet and four inches long, heavy in hand.  

The Black Horse Gang was merely a martial faction, yet they now carried a military air.  

Was this the power of a battle formation?  

The enemies, desperate to seize the military payroll, had resorted to gifting the Black Horse Gang such forbidden techniques. Did they not fear being consumed by their own flames?  

Dou Changsheng narrowed his eyes, his hand gripping his sword hilt.  

Instantly, his blood boiled. Strength and courage flooded his body like a tidal wave.  

This wasn’t a martial duel—it was a battlefield charge.  

In narrow roads, the brave prevail.  

Dou Changsheng didn’t retreat. Instead, he spurred his horse forward.  

**Advancing, not retreating.**  

Heroic fervor surged within him.  

He knew the enemy’s weaknesses, and his innate qi was vast.  

Dou Changsheng’s confidence soared.  

A single-handed charge was the ultimate test of courage.  

His first sword thrust unleashed his innate qi, erupting from the blade’s tip.  

A pure white sword aura, initially three inches long, instantly expanded to six inches—then a foot.  

The *Fearless Sword Art* thrived on courage. With unwavering resolve, the sword grew stronger.  

Under its aura, nothing could stand in his way.  

A Black Horse Gang member fell instantly, his chest pierced.  

The second strike—a wild sweep.  

The sword aura dimmed, flickering as if dissolving.  

This strike, not part of the *Fearless Sword Art*, was weaker but still devastating. A foot-long sword aura cleaved through everything—blades, flesh—all split in two.  

The path ahead cleared instantly.  

The Black Horse Gang’s unstoppable charge was torn apart from the northwest.  

The third strike—another thrust.  

The *Fearless Sword Art* flowed smoothly now, his innate qi circulating effortlessly. Its efficiency improved, its power rising further.  

Facing such weak foes, Dou Changsheng’s confidence multiplied.  

Naturally, his sword grew stronger.  

In moments, he’d cut through the Black Horse Gang. No one could withstand a single strike.  

The remaining gang members scattered, too terrified to regroup.  

Having witnessed their charge shattered, their courage had fled. They were mere bandits, not soldiers—a rabble.  

Dou Changsheng’s blood burned, his body feverish from the slaughter.  

Turning back, he spotted half of the silver-armored leader’s corpse—bisected at the waist. In his frenzy, he hadn’t noticed when the enemy leader had fallen.  

No matter.  

The *Fearless Sword Art*, though a basic innate sword technique, was exceptionally pure.  

Dou Changsheng admitted—it felt exhilarating.  

But its flaw was severe: the moment fear took hold, it became useless.  

And how many could remain fearless against overwhelming odds?  

In short—a perfect tool for crushing the weak!  

---  

In the distance, Earth Walker observed the battlefield, watching the figure on horseback continue forward, his shadow stretching long under the bloody sunset.  

The three-foot rusted sword gleamed ominously in the fading light.  

It was a sight that chilled the soul.  

After a long silence, Earth Walker finally muttered, "This Dou Changsheng… something’s off."  

"He’s stronger than when he killed Wang Xiong."  

Beside him, Wind Wing said grimly, "Not stronger—he was hiding his true power. That wasn’t his limit last time."  

"Not even twenty years old… where does such vast innate qi come from?"  

"The *Triple Origin Qi Art* isn’t known for abundant qi!"  

Wind Wing turned to Earth Walker. "Days of preparation, wasted. He tore through us effortlessly."  

"Our plan failed."  

"Do we still proceed?"  

Earth Walker gritted his teeth. "We must."  

"Otherwise, Dou Changsheng will reach Sword Gate Pass."  

"Isn’t Ai Haike nearby?"  

"Bring him. We’ll ambush him tonight."  

"I refuse to believe three innate martial artists can’t defeat one in a sneak attack."
