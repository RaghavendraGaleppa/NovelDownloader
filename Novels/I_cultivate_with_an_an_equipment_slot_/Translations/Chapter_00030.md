# Chapter 30: Smooth Journey, Knowledge Inheritance  

A purple-tier equipment!  

This was the first time Zhang Yan had seen purple equipment.  

After all this time, he had gained some understanding of his Equipment Panel's tendencies. The panel's evaluation of equipment quality wasn't based on the equipment's inherent level.  

For example:  

A low-grade magical artifact could be green or blue.  

Meanwhile, a high-grade magical artifact might still be gray.  

From what he knew so far, magical artifacts were categorized into gray, green, and blue tiers.  

This purple tier was clearly superior to blue.  

"I must obtain this artifact!" Zhang Yan silently vowed.  

Moreover, the most important thing was...  

This artifact contained a perfected-level spell.  

That was incredibly valuable to him!  

With this in mind, he steadied his emotions and immediately approached the stall.  

The stall owner was a beautiful woman with a welcoming demeanor.  

Spotting Zhang Yan, she greeted him warmly.  

"May I ask what has caught your eye, fellow Daoist?" the woman asked with a smile.  

"Just browsing. I'll let you know if I find something," Zhang Yan replied casually, not mentioning the iron fragment he had his eye on.  

The Qingheng Market was different from the sect's market—everyone here was solely profit-driven.  

The woman's stall was a mix of talismans, pills, and various unidentified fragments.  

Zhang Yan crouched down to examine them before asking, "Madam, what are all these fragments?"  

"These? They were all unearthed from ancient ruins. Rumor has it they contain great treasures," the woman said without hesitation.  

"And their price?"  

"That depends on which fragment you're interested in," she replied, her smile widening as her eyes gleamed with calculation.  

"This one, this one, and this one."  

Zhang Yan randomly pointed at a few fragments. He didn't use the cliché tactic of buying something else and asking for the fragment as a freebie—after all, no one was foolish enough to fall for that these days.  

Instead, he selected multiple fragments to obscure his true target.  

"These fragments will cost you 200 spirit stones," the woman said after a moment of consideration.  

"200 spirit stones?"  

Zhang Yan nearly laughed in disbelief.  

"These are just broken artifact fragments with almost no spiritual essence left, and you're asking for 200? Why not just rob me? I was only interested in studying ancient artifacts, but if that's your price, you can keep them!"  

With that, he turned to leave without hesitation.  

These fragments were useless to anyone but him. The woman was clearly trying to swindle inexperienced newcomers—those who still believed they were destined to uncover some grand treasure from these scraps.  

After a few years of harsh reality in the cultivation world, such naivety would fade.  

"One..."  

"Two..."  

"Three..."  

As Zhang Yan strode away, he silently counted.  

Right as he reached three, the woman called out.  

"Fellow Daoist, wait! The price is negotiable—how much are you willing to pay?"  

Seeing Zhang Yan about to leave, she panicked.  

These fragments were indeed from ancient ruins, but they were practically worthless.  

They had been gathering dust on her stall for ages, and now that a potential buyer had finally appeared, she couldn't let him slip away.  

"Negotiable?" Zhang Yan paused, turning back. "You have one last chance. If the price is still unreasonable, I'm leaving."  

His voice, muffled by the bamboo hat, was calm but firm.  

The pressure of a single counteroffer made the woman hesitate.  

After a few breaths, seeing Zhang Yan about to walk away again, she blurted, "50! Just 50 spirit stones!"  

"50?"  

This time, the price had dropped by three-fourths.  

The woman had clearly intended to fleece him earlier.  

But even at 50, Zhang Yan wasn't satisfied.  

"30 spirit stones. Take it or leave it."  

With the bamboo hat and the Concealing Mask, the woman couldn't read his expression.  

"Fine, they're yours! I suppose you and these fragments are fated," she sighed dramatically.  

After paying the spirit stones and pocketing the fragments, Zhang Yan finally relaxed.  

Purple-tier equipment—his first ever.  

He continued walking through the market, pretending to browse while actually inspecting the fragment's attributes.  

Aside from the perfected Water Element Technique, he was far more intrigued by the other trait:  

**[Knowledge Inheritance]:** Upon equipping, grants a one-time knowledge transfer.  

"Knowledge inheritance... I wonder what kind of knowledge it will be."  

Zhang Yan was eager to find out, but since he was still in the market, he resisted the urge to equip the fragment immediately.  

Instead, he continued browsing.  

Perhaps his luck had run dry, as he found no other noteworthy artifacts for the rest of his visit.  

Still, he wasn't discouraged—he managed to gather plenty of medicinal herbs.  

Soon, it was time to regroup.  

Zhang Yan removed the Concealing Mask and bamboo hat, then obediently rejoined the Liu family elder.  

"Everyone's here. Let's head back."  

Once the group was assembled, the elder signaled their departure.  

The reason for the haste?  

The market was about to close.  

Staying overnight required payment—nothing exorbitant, but the Liu family preferred to save where they could.  

Since cultivators didn't tire easily, they planned to travel day and night back to the Liu estate.  

At first, Zhang Yan was tense, fearing an ambush by treasure-hunting bandits.  

But his worries proved unfounded.  

Their large group made them an unappealing target—any would-be robbers would likely end up as the ones getting robbed.  

The journey was smooth and uneventful.  

Upon returning to the Liu estate, the family members dispersed to report their findings, while Zhang Yan retreated to his private courtyard.  

He retrieved the Water Tome fragment.  

"Let's see what this 'knowledge inheritance' is all about."  

With that thought, he equipped the fragment.  

A flash of spiritual light.  

Zhang Yan's mind cleared instantly as profound insights into the Water Element Technique flooded his consciousness.  

In the next moment, a surge of knowledge poured into his mind.
