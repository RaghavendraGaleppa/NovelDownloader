# Chapter 37: Qi Refinement Third Layer

"Talismanic Source Generation?"

Zhang Jing looked at this skill attribute with confusion, only to have a stream of information emerge in his mind.

After a long while.

"So that's how it is!" A flash of understanding crossed his face.

The so-called Talismanic Source Generation referred to Zhang Jing's ability to capture a fragment of the source talisman each time he successfully drew a talisman. When these fragments coalesced into a complete source talisman, it could freely shift between reality and illusion at his will.

The source talisman was intimately connected to his spiritual sense and spiritual power.

With the source talisman in hand,

Zhang Jing could simply summon the corresponding source talisman and directly imprint the Dao patterns onto spiritual paper whenever he wanted to create talismans. Theoretically, as long as he had sufficient spiritual power, he could continuously produce corresponding talismans without any possibility of failure.

Reading this,

Zhang Jing's expression couldn't help but turn peculiar.

Why did this concept feel increasingly familiar to him—wasn't it similar to movable type printing?

Then excitement flashed in his eyes.

With source talismans, wouldn't his talisman-making speed increase dramatically? This way, the task of accumulating nine thousand Dao merits might be achievable within two or three years!

He didn't need source talismans for high-grade talismans—just mid-grade ones would suffice.

Returning to reality,

A wave of exhaustion washed over him.

"I'll continue tomorrow!" Zhang Jing stood up and headed straight for the cultivation chamber.

Two days later.

In the talisman-making room.

Zhang Jing, who had been sitting motionless at the table, suddenly smiled.

Before him lay three completed Star Guidance Talismans, with a stack of failed talismans beside them.

After two days of relentless testing,

Zhang Jing now had a relatively accurate assessment of the success rate for the first-level Ninefold Stellar Spirit Talisman skill.

Without activating the Mind's Eye Dao Seed,

His success rate for making Star Guidance Talismans was about ten percent. Of course, this rate would fluctuate with his condition, but it generally stabilized around ten percent.

Using ten sets of materials would yield one Star Guidance Talisman.

Zhang Jing did the math.

Disregarding the depreciation of the spirit brush for now,

Ten sheets of spiritual paper cost one Dao merit, and the spiritual ink consumed was roughly worth half a Dao merit. This meant his cost for a Star Guidance Talisman was 1.5 Dao merits.

According to the Thousand Methods Pavilion's pricing, one Star Guidance Talisman could be sold for two Dao merits.

But considering that others might not buy his talismans if they were priced the same as the Pavilion's, Zhang Jing temporarily set his price at 1.9 Dao merits.

All things considered,

Without neglecting his cultivation, Zhang Jing could earn 0.4 Dao merits per day through diligent talisman-making.

---

A month would yield twelve Dao merits.

This income wasn't insignificant, considering that those ranked twenty-first to thirtieth in the recent assessment only received five Dao merits monthly from the Dao Academy.

From what Zhang Jing knew,

The most ordinary outer court disciples who hadn't joined any mission teams spent about ten Dao merits on cultivation resources every two months.

Of course, twelve Dao merits wasn't exactly a fortune.

But—that was without activating the Mind's Eye Dao Seed.

With the Mind's Eye active, Zhang Jing's talisman-making success rate would skyrocket to around thirty percent.

This meant if he focused solely on making Star Guidance Talismans, he could earn 4.2 Dao merits per day, accumulating a profit of one hundred twenty Dao merits per month.

In reality,

Zhang Jing might not be able to sell all the talismans he produced. But he estimated that netting one hundred Dao merits monthly wouldn't be a problem.

The spirit brush would pay for itself in two months, after which it would be pure profit.

Moreover, with future source talisman condensation, upgrades to the Stellar Spirit Talisman skill, and the ability to craft mid-grade or even high-grade talismans as his cultivation advanced, his Dao merit accumulation would only accelerate.

Zhang Jing exhaled deeply.

He had indeed made the right choice with the Stellar Spirit Talisman inheritance!

Regaining his composure,

He calmed his excited thoughts and began another experiment.

Holding the spirit brush, dipping it in spiritual ink, Zhang Jing swiftly danced across the spiritual paper with practiced ease.

Unlike before, this time a faint trace of the Shadow Serpent Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme lingered in his brushstrokes as he drew the talismanic patterns.

It was precisely this wisp of Dao Rhyme,

That caused the Star Guidance Talisman before him to become unusually volatile, with the spiritual energy in the cave spontaneously merging into the talisman.

In an instant, it gave Zhang Jing the feeling that it was about to explode.

Watching this, Zhang Jing's eyelids twitched, but he gritted his teeth and continued.

The Five Methods Spirit River encircled him, with five Frostlight Curse spell-fish ready to leap out and transform into protective spiritual light at any moment.

However, the next moment,

With a sharp 'snap', to Zhang Jing's astonishment, the half-finished talisman before him shattered into fragments.

"Probably because the low-grade spiritual paper is too fragile to withstand a Star Guidance Talisman imbued with the Shadow Serpent Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme,"

Zhang Jing speculated silently.

It seemed he would need to purchase some mid-grade spiritual paper on his next visit to the Thousand Methods Pavilion.

---

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

During this month, Zhang Jing hadn't received any notice from Senior Sister Tong, indicating they were either still recuperating or waiting for a suitable mission.

With no disturbances,

Zhang Jing was content to remain in his cave dwelling, cultivating and making talismans.

His days were exhaustingly busy yet fulfilling.

On this day,

In the cultivation chamber,

A powerful surge of spiritual energy suddenly erupted, swirling the spiritual mist outward and creating strong winds within the cave.

"Qi Refinement third layer!" A spiritual light flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

He hadn't expected that the cycle of exhausting and replenishing spiritual power during talisman-making would significantly accelerate his cultivation progress.

Coupled with the aid of Purple Spirit Pills,

These combined factors allowed Zhang Jing to reach the third layer of Qi Refinement half a month earlier than anticipated.

He instinctively summoned the Five Spirits River.

Instantly, a more turbulent spiritual river than before appeared before Zhang Jing, meandering with eight spell-fish swimming within.

After a brief assessment,

Zhang Jing understood the changes in his spiritual river.

Its capacity for spell-fish had increased to twelve.

Four additional spells—this was within expectations, as he had guessed when he first reached the second layer of Qi Refinement.

However, he couldn't predict how the Five Methods Spirit River would evolve from the third to fourth layer of Qi Refinement, though he looked forward to it.

After all, that would mark the qualitative leap from early to mid-stage Qi Refinement.

The Five Methods Spirit River's capacity would undoubtedly increase substantially—perhaps then, his Ten Thousand Techniques Torrent would begin to take shape.

With a thought,

A translucent jade talisman slowly materialized.

[Five Organs Liberation Water Origin Annotation·Third Level (139/800)]
Skill Attribute: Five Methods Spirit River (Intermediate)

[Pure Essence Breath Absorption Visualization·Third Level (399/600)]
Skill Attribute: Gathering Essence Spiritual Light (Basic)

Scanning the jade talisman,

A satisfied smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

At this rate, the Pure Essence Breath Absorption Visualization would reach the fourth level in about half a month, granting him another skill attribute.

With the precedent of the Gathering Essence Spiritual Light, he was full of anticipation for this new attribute.

The jade talisman gradually faded.

Estimating the time,

It was probably early morning.

Zhang Jing rose and headed to the talisman-making room.

On the table lay a thick stack of completed talismans—sixty-seven defensive Star Guidance Talismans and sixteen offensive Scorching Sun Talismans.

All were of superior quality.

These were the fruits of his month's labor.

Only about two hundred blank spiritual papers remained.

Zhang Jing planned to visit the Thousand Methods Pavilion today to sell some of these low-grade talismans and replenish his supply of spiritual paper and ink.
