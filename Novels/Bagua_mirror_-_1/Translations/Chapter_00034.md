# Chapter 34: Mountain Village  

Hearing this, Huang Fei expressionlessly stored away the corpse of the Scarlet-Eyed Silver Flood Dragon.  

"Fellow Daoist Huang, what is the meaning of this? Are you breaking our agreement?"  

"Fellow Daoist Wang, please calm your anger. I’ve merely kept the corpse for now. Let us pursue that thief immediately—he couldn’t have gotten far. I cannot afford to swallow such a loss."  

With that, the four of them chased down the branching path where the beast egg had disappeared.  

At this moment, only a few dozen Flying Ants were in action, but these little creatures were not only incredibly strong but also remarkably fast. From a distance, Qin Chong spotted a black dot flying toward him.  

Earlier, Qin Chong had obtained a spirit beast pouch after killing the cultivator with the Earth Armor Beast. Now, it came in handy. He wasn’t comfortable keeping the beast egg together with the Flying Ants.  

After securing the egg, Qin Chong immediately turned and fled, casting a Wind-Riding Spell on his legs to increase his speed.  

Having seized such a huge advantage, he knew the others wouldn’t let him go easily. Now was the time to run.  

Huang Fei and the others had been delayed by the aftermath of the talisman treasure attack. By the time they gave chase, Qin Chong was long gone.  

"Fellow Daoist Huang, what now?" asked the Wang cultivator.  

"There are only two paths ahead. We’ll split up and pursue," Huang Fei replied decisively.  

However, the Wang cultivator stopped him.  

"Fellow Daoist Huang, whether we can catch him is uncertain. I suggest we divide the Scarlet-Eyed Silver Flood Dragon’s corpse first before chasing. Otherwise, who knows when we’ll meet again?"  

"Senior Brother Wang is right. The tunnels here are a maze—once we separate, it’ll be hard to regroup," added the other Qingxuan Sect cultivator.  

"Fellow Daoist Wang, wasting time like this means we’ll never catch him," Huang Fei said helplessly.  

"Then how about this? Dismantling the corpse will indeed take time. Fellow Daoist Huang, just estimate its value and compensate us with spirit stones instead."  

Seeing Wang’s concession, Huang Fei had no choice but to agree.  

Even so, precious time was lost.  

Qin Chong sprinted wildly, paying no attention to direction. He took any tunnel he found, as long as it didn’t lead him back the way he came.  

But after over an hour, he sensed faint traces of other cultivators behind him. He had no choice but to push himself even harder.  

Unbeknownst to Qin Chong, Huang Fei and the others had already lost his trail.  

After a day and night of fleeing, Qin Chong suddenly spotted light ahead and was overjoyed.  

---

This wasn’t the glow of Moonlight Stones—it was natural light from the outside world.  

Looking at the rolling mountains beyond, Qin Chong’s expression turned grim. He had emerged on the other side of the Cangwu Mountains.  

This wasn’t the Canglong Valley’s mining outpost. In his frantic escape, he had taken a winding path and exited from a different direction.  

Realization struck him—this was Qingxuan Sect territory.  

Surveying the area, he saw no buildings or camps. Behind him, the cliff face had over a dozen small entrances.  

It seemed the Qingxuan Sect hadn’t stationed guards here. They were only interested in plundering spirit stones from the mines.  

Wait—other cultivators!  

Sensing danger, Qin Chong immediately mounted his Silver Frost Sword and fled.  

Fortunately, he had studied maps extensively. Though the records of Qingchuan County weren’t detailed, he had a general idea of the region.  

Now, he flew straight toward the outskirts of the Cangwu Mountains.  

He needed a safe route back to Pingyang County. Crossing the Cangwu Mountains was impossible—not only were they treacherous and dense with forests, but the beasts within were beyond his ability to handle.  

If not for the Canglong Valley’s Foundation Establishment cultivators escorting them on a Dragon Boat, he wouldn’t have made it here in the first place.  

Returning through the mines was also impractical. The tunnels on the Qingxuan Sect’s side were numerous and unfamiliar, making it hard to find his way back.  

Moreover, he risked encountering Qingxuan Sect cultivators. Alone, he stood no chance.  

Luckily, the Cangwu Mountains didn’t stretch far into Qingchuan County. A short flight would take him to safer, flatter terrain.  

Even so, shortly after taking off, he heard the roars of beasts—clearly beyond his strength to face.  

Half an hour later, Qin Chong finally reached the edge of the Cangwu Mountains.  

He found a secluded spot to rest, recovering his energy while plotting his return route on the map.  

After studying it carefully, his expression darkened.  

The Cangwu Mountains spanned thousands of miles, extending all the way to the border of the Song Kingdom. Beyond lay the Han Kingdom, whose strength far surpassed Song’s.  

It was said that each of Han’s four major sects rivaled the Vermilion Flame Sect in power—far beyond what the Qingxuan Sect or Canglong Valley could match.  

---

After reviewing the map, Qin Chong’s mood grew heavier.  

There was no other choice. He would have to follow the edge of the Cangwu Mountains south, skirting the border between the two kingdoms to return to Pingyang County.  

If all went well, he could reach Pingyang City within three months.  

But the journey wouldn’t be smooth. Some areas required detours, and if he encountered troublesome beasts, it would take even longer.  

After careful consideration, Qin Chong conservatively estimated it would take half a year.  

After resting for a few days, he set out, traveling mostly by night.  

Over a month later, he arrived at a nameless mountain village. He hadn’t planned to stop, but he had stumbled upon a group of youths under attack by wild beasts.  

Acting on impulse, Qin Chong saved them. Grateful, the youngsters insisted he visit their village, and he reluctantly agreed.  

Most villagers here bore the surname Ren, living in a small settlement of barely a hundred people.  

From a mortal’s perspective, it was a place detached from the world. The villagers worked from sunrise to sunset, yet their lives were harsh.  

Apart from two types of coarse grains, they relied heavily on hunted game and wild vegetables to survive.  

"Honored benefactor, this is my home. Let me call my parents," said Ren Feng, one of the youths Qin Chong had saved and the most persistent in inviting him to the village.  

That evening, Ren Feng’s parents prepared a modest feast in Qin Chong’s honor. They had thanked him profusely since his arrival.  

Though the small table was laden with food, Qin Chong felt a pang in his heart.  

Two plates of unidentified meat, some wild fruits, and a few dull-colored cornbread buns.  

Having grown up in a cultivation family, Qin Chong had never lacked for food. Even ordinary citizens in Pingyang City lived comfortably.  

But here, the contrast was stark—a sight that stirred an inexplicable sorrow in him.
