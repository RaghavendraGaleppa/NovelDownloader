# Chapter 45: The Wealthy Monk Jia Shifang!  

"What the hell?"  

Li Zhengjing was startled and immediately reacted, using the "Breeze Follows Shadow" movement technique to dodge the golden vajra staff hurtling toward him.  

Just as he was about to draw his blade, a monk's robe came flying at him like a net!  

"Second Brother, don't resist! Let me send you to the Western Paradise!"  

"Send your grandpa to paradise!" Li Zhengjing cursed loudly.  

"My grandpa is your maternal grandfather—why are you cursing him?"  

The monk's face was streaked with tears, but his movements were swift. He swiftly pulled a string of prayer beads from his chest and flung them at Li Zhengjing, wailing, "Second Brother, don’t dodge! Let me deliver you to salvation!"  

"Ha! You bald donkey! With your measly skills, you dare ambush us? Too bad for you!"  

A gentle yet excited voice came from the sky.  

The monk looked up and saw a green-horned, golden-feathered bird swooping down, spitting fire from its beak!  

The monk was startled and quickly pulled out a monk's bowl, raising it toward the sky.  

In an instant, the flames were sucked into the bowl, which then emitted a radiant light, trapping the bird inside!  

The bowl flipped upside down as it landed, imprisoning the bird beneath it.  

At the same time, Li Zhengjing drew his blade and swung with the "Five Thunder Mountain-Splitting Saber Technique," aiming straight for the monk!  

The monk blocked with his vajra staff, then swiftly looped his prayer beads around Li Zhengjing’s neck.  

"Second Brother… I know you died with unresolved grievances, your soul lingering as a ghost. Now you’ve traveled thousands of miles from the capital to Xuanling Prefecture, still thinking of your little brother."  

Tears streamed down the monk’s face as he sobbed, "Let me send you off properly—"  

*Slap!*  

Li Zhengjing tore off the prayer beads and smacked the monk across the face.  

"What kind of bald donkey are you, trying to ruin my Dao heart?"  

Before the monk could react, Li Zhengjing kicked him to the ground.  

The monk clutched his aching body, his expression shifting between shock and disbelief.  

"Second Brother… you’re not dead?"  

"Even if you die, my master won’t!" The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its tender branches and taunted, "Good men die young, but villains live a thousand years! My master is practically immortal!"  

"Another monster?" The monk gasped. "Damn, I’ve been tricked—this must be a shapeshifting demon!"  

"Jia Shifang?"  

Li Zhengjing stepped closer, eyeing the completely bald monk with a strange expression. "You, who spent all your time in brothels—how did you end up a monk?"  

The monk looked up at Li Zhengjing, his face a mix of emotions. After a long pause, he touched his swollen cheek and suddenly beamed.  

"Second Brother, you’re really alive?"  

Li Zhengjing kicked him again.  

The monk howled in pain, but once the pain faded, his shock only grew.  

"How is this possible? I saw you buried with my own eyes! I cried at your grave, burned incense for you—"  

"It’s a long story." Li Zhengjing exhaled, unwilling to explain further. "What are you doing here?"  

"That’s also a long story."  

The monk lowered his head, looking embarrassed.  

"Master, you know this bald donkey?" The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches in surprise.  

"His father is my uncle," Li Zhengjing said.  

"Oh, so Master is the bald donkey’s brother," the tree thought to itself.  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing studied the monk and said, "Make it short."  

The monk hesitated. "Well… it’s a bit shameful—"  

*Slap!*  

The right side of the monk’s face swelled up.  

"Second Brother, stop hitting me!"  

The monk quickly raised his hands in surrender and began explaining.  

Back in Qinghai Prefecture, he had been frolicking with a dozen girls when he received the tragic news: his second cousin, Li Zhengjing of the Jian'an Marquisate, had been poisoned and died without a cure. He immediately traveled to the capital with his father to attend the funeral.  

"At your grave, I cried for half a day until my throat was dry. Remembering how much you loved drinking in brothels and how your literary talents had left a legacy in every pleasure house in the capital..."  

The monk lowered his voice. "To honor your memory, I endured the pain and visited a brothel during your mourning period… to quench my thirst."  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing’s expression darkened. He kicked the monk seventeen or eighteen times.  

*I die, and you go to the capital for my funeral… only to visit a brothel?*  

*And you call that mourning? To quench your thirst?!*  

Unable to contain his anger, Li Zhengjing kicked him once more.  

"Second Brother, calm down! I really was mourning you!"  

The monk hurriedly continued, "You left behind hundreds of poems in the capital’s brothels, earning a legendary reputation! After your death, many courtesans wept for you, so I comforted them in your stead—*stop hitting me!*"  

He begged for mercy before continuing, "The scholars in the capital all acknowledged your genius but criticized your indulgence in brothels, calling you a disgrace to the literati. After your death, they celebrated, saying the world had finally brightened… and then they went to the brothels themselves."  

Li Zhengjing had an inkling of what happened next. "So you got into a fight over a courtesan?"  

The monk nodded. "Mainly because I couldn’t stand them mocking your early death..."  

He spread his hands. "Second Brother knows our Jia family’s wealth spans half the Great Zhou Dynasty—that’s why I’m called Jia Shifang (Wealthy in Ten Directions)! When it comes to money, who can compete with us? When that guy realized he couldn’t outspend me, he pulled rank, claiming he was from the Dali Temple..."  

"I lost my temper. What kind of monk from the Dali Temple doesn’t even shave his head, breaking every monastic rule, yet dares visit brothels? So I beat him up in the name of Buddha."  

"Things escalated. Turns out, the Dali Temple isn’t a monastery..."  

Jia Shifang sighed. "My father scolded me for being ignorant. I argued back, so he beat me and sent me to the Vajra Temple—a real monastery—to become a monk."  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing frowned slightly, thinking to himself, *So the signs of this turmoil were already visible half a year ago. The Jian'an Marquisate sent me to the Feather Immortal Sect, while the Jia family sent Jia Shifang to the Vajra Temple… Were they preserving their bloodlines before the coming storm?*  

He suspected this had originated with the Jian'an Marquisate. His father must have advised the Jia family in the capital, leading them to send Jia Shifang to the Vajra Temple as a precaution.  

"Speaking of which, the Vajra Temple is a 'Buddhist sacred land,' on par with the three great immortal sects."  

Li Zhengjing studied him. "You joined the Vajra Temple after me, yet you’ve already cultivated Inner Qi? Is your talent greater than mine? And the treasures you used are all high-grade magical artifacts… Are they grooming you as the next Buddha’s heir?"  

"Well..."  

Jia Shifang scratched his head sheepishly. "Mainly because my father funded the expansion of three meditation halls for the Vajra Temple and built thirty-two temples in Qinghai to spread Buddhist teachings..."  

Li Zhengjing fell silent, recalling his own struggles during his first half-year in the Feather Immortal Sect. Then he grabbed Jia Shifang and punched him seventeen or eighteen times.  

"I *hate* rich people!"  

"Save the brotherly bonding for later! Get me out of here!"  

The bowl trembled violently as a voice cried out from inside, "What kind of damn thing is this? I’m suffocating!"  

Li Zhengjing sighed. "Let it out!"  

The monk rubbed his head awkwardly. "Ah… I only learned how to *capture* things with this bowl. The *release* technique… I haven’t mastered yet."
