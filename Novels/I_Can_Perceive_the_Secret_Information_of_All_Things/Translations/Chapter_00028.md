# Chapter 28: Fishing

The Cuckoo Gang had no fixed territory. Their reputation was so poor—often selling goods only to rob them back shortly after—that most people avoided their wares, fearing their hard-earned spirit stones would be wasted.  

The earliest records of this gang described them as a band of marauding refugees, later taken over by cultivators who turned them into highwaymen targeting fellow practitioners.  

Though they never grew into a major sect, the gang was well-organized despite its small size. At the top was the leader, supported by the second and third in command, followed by hall masters and stewards. Even the lowest-ranking members were divided into several tiers.  

Promotion was simple: the more loot you brought in, the higher your status and the better your treatment.  

Leaving the gang mid-way? That meant certain death.  

Most rogue cultivators would avoid joining the Cuckoo Gang at all costs—unless they had no other choice.  

Because the gang had no humanity left in them.  

As night fell over the world...  

In a tavern near the Black Dragon Market, inside a private room...  

"We've got a good haul this time. The quality might be average, but it'll still make us a hefty profit," said a burly man with a thick beard, holding a bowl of wine in one hand and a roasted lamb leg in the other, his mouth glistening with grease. "Third Brother, you've done well."  

"It's all thanks to your guidance, Big Brother. Without you leading the Cuckoo Gang, I wouldn't have improved so quickly," replied the weaselly-looking man called Third Brother, raising his cup in a respectful toast.  

The bearded man was none other than the leader of the Cuckoo Gang.  

"I invited you all here tonight to announce that we're moving," the leader said. "Once we sell this batch of goods, we're relocating. This place is too close to Ancient City. With blood on our hands, we should leave before they trace it back to us."  

"Big Brother, don't worry. I was extremely careful this time—there's no way they'll find us," Third Brother said, thinking the leader was overreacting. "Besides, how many times have we killed and robbed before?"  

"Exactly. The Black Dragon Market is close to Ancient City, attracting many Qi Condensation cultivators. It's a prime spot—leaving now would be a waste," the second-in-command chimed in.  

"We need to think long-term. We can't risk everything for short-term gains. Third Brother struck on a floating ship this time," the leader said, losing his appetite and setting down the lamb leg. "And that ship departed from Ancient City. I hear the corpse is still lying at the docks there. If the Great Immortal Sanyun decides to investigate thoroughly, we're in trouble."  

The Great Immortal Sanyun's cultivation level was like a mountain crushing an egg compared to the Cuckoo Gang's Qi Condensation practitioners—utterly incomparable.  

"Also, I've been having nightmares lately," the leader said with a grimace. "A Taoist priest keeps laughing at me in my dreams. He doesn't say a word—just laughs."  

Nightmares weren't unusual, and the others dismissed it as stress from managing the gang. They urged him to relax and enjoy the feast.  

"Fine. If you all think we shouldn't move yet, we'll stay in the Black Dragon Market for another year or so," the leader conceded. "But we'll hold off on selling this batch for now—wait a few days and see how things unfold."  

"As you say, Big Brother. We'll delay the sale," Third Brother agreed. "The goods are already stored in our secret vault. Just pick an auspicious day when you're ready."  

This was how the Cuckoo Gang operated: stealing from others and selling the loot on the black market.  

---  

Xiao Ji walked through the Black Dragon Market.  

It was sizable—almost like a large village. The main street was lined with shops and stalls: taverns, teahouses, brothels...  

This wasn't a proper town, just a settlement that had grown around the black market.  

Geographically, it was within human territory but ungoverned by any nation—merely a byproduct of Ancient City's influence.  

There were no dedicated artifact shops here. Sellers operated on a hit-and-run basis, conducting one-time deals before moving on.  

Most just set up temporary stalls.  

The quality of artifacts here paled in comparison to Ancient City's, but the prices were dirt cheap. Since many goods were stolen, looted, or scavenged, they sold at a steep discount, offering high value for the cost.  

Low-level rogue cultivators loved this place.  

Most visitors were poor practitioners, none reaching Foundation Establishment—just early to mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators.  

The market wasn't open daily. It operated once every half-month, exclusively at night.  

Xiao Ji spotted a few interesting and practical artifacts, but his meager spirit stones kept him from splurging.  

He wasn't here to shop. He was here to hunt treasure.  

His clues pointed to the Black Dragon Market—and specifically, the Cuckoo Gang.  

After walking the length of the market twice, he sensed his target wasn't on display yet. The goods hadn't hit the stalls.  

He stopped outside a modest tavern called Fortune Hall.  

[The Cuckoo Gang's higher-ups are feasting inside.]  

"Tch. Must be celebrating a big haul," Xiao Ji mused. Spotting his mark, he entered when a waiter greeted him.  

He chose a seat in the main hall with a clear view of the gang, ordering a small jug of rice wine and two meat dishes with a side of vegetables. The waiter hurried off to fulfill the order.  

After some observation, Xiao Ji confirmed the gang's loot wasn't on them—it was stashed at their hideout.  

He also identified Third Brother as Ge Qingniu's killer.  

Following this man would lead him straight to the goods.  

As for the gang's strength? Xiao Ji summed it up in his mind:  

The leader was the strongest at Qi Condensation seventh stage. The rest ranged from first to fifth stage.  

He had overestimated them initially. In reality, they were just small fry—ruthless and numerous, but nothing more.  

With the right plan, Xiao Ji was confident he could wipe out this gang single-handedly.  

When the waiter brought his food, Xiao Ji ate slowly.  

By the time the Cuckoo Gang's leaders left their private room past midnight, he was ready.  

"Waiter, check!" Xiao Ji slapped his Thunderclap Sword onto the table and called for the bill.  

The noise drew glances from several gang members.  

[Third Brother has noticed you. He covets your sword and plans to take it for himself.]  

Xiao Ji remained calm, sheathed his sword, paid, and left.  

Third Brother waved off his companions and followed.  

Xiao Ji smirked, suppressing a tipsy hiccup.  

The fish had taken the bait.
