Chapter 75: The Battle Begins!!

Ke Yunfei's eyes turned cold as he gazed at the Golden Monk, who had taken on an aggressive stance. "You" Hall emphasized the importance of being unpredictable in combat. Once he got close to his opponent, he had dozens of ways to kill them silently. Ke Yunfei's strongest skill was the "Merciless Sword," a ruthless technique that focused on killing his opponent as quickly as possible.

Meng Wei, on the other hand, felt a sense of unease as he sensed that something was off about the Sea Sand Gang's actions. However, he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. As he calmed down, Ke Yunfei prepared to launch a surprise attack.

Just as Ke Yunfei was about to pounce, the Golden Monk pulled out a talisman and a gray box from his sleeve. Han Li, who was watching from a distance, was shocked and his eyes widened in alarm. He recognized the object in the Golden Monk's hand as something he had read about in the notes left behind by Mo Daifu, a powerful修仙者 (cultivator).

"Be careful!!!" Li Zhiming shouted, standing up and warning everyone, "The sect master, he's a修仙者!!"

The Golden Monk was taken aback by Li Zhiming's words, but he quickly regained his composure and sneered, "You little brat, you're just a mortal, but you've got good eyes. If Su Zongguang hadn't told me to spare you, I would have taken care of you by now."

Meng Wei slammed his hand on the table, shouting, "Be careful!" Ke Yunfei didn't hesitate and charged towards the Golden Monk with a sword.

The Golden Monk smiled and activated a golden talisman, which formed a protective barrier around him. Ke Yunfei's sword clashed with the barrier, producing a loud clang. The Golden Monk then opened the gray box, revealing a gray talisman inside. He wrote a符 (magical script) on the talisman, sealed it with his blood, and said, "Arise."

The gray talisman ignited, transforming into a gray sword that hovered in mid-air.

Meng Wei couldn't remain seated anymore. "Kill them!!" he shouted.

The Golden Monk chuckled, "You're a bit too late, friend." With a flick of his finger, the gray sword shot towards Ke Yunfei, but its true target was Meng Wei, who was sitting at the back.

Ke Yunfei was horrified and tried to dodge, but the gray sword was too fast. It sliced through him, cutting him in two. Despite his fatal wound, Ke Yunfei mustered his last bit of strength and launched a desperate attack at the Golden Monk. However, his sword was deflected by the Golden Monk's protective barrier.

The Golden Monk didn't even flinch as Ke Yunfei fell to the ground, dead. He continued to manipulate the talisman, and the gray sword instantly turned towards Meng Wei.

Meng Wei was shocked and tried to react, but it was too late. The gray sword sliced through his chest, killing him instantly.

The scene was met with shock and horror. Li Zhiming was stunned, his perception of修仙者 shattered. He had always admired their longevity and abilities, but now he realized that even the weakest修仙者 could kill martial artists like them with ease.

As Meng Wei fell, the thirty-six elders lost control and charged towards the Golden Monk and Su Zongguang. Su Zongguang remained seated, a cold smile on his face, as he raised his teacup.
