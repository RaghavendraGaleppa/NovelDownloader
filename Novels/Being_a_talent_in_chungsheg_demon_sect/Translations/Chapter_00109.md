# The True Disciples of the Sacred Sect

Beneath the Sacred Flame Cliff, at the Sky-Reaching Cloud Sea.

A black-robed youth with a somber countenance sat cross-legged on a small boat, regulating his breathing. After a long while, he looked out at the vast, boundless cloud sea before him.

*Boom!*

In an instant, the cloud sea churned. Waves surged into the sky, sweeping towards the black-robed youth as he inhaled and exhaled, pressing down upon him!

Almost simultaneously, the black-robed youth opened his eyes, his spiritual power almost reaching its limit. He unleashed a burst of "Heavenly Craft True Qi" that he had painstakingly refined, which thundered forth, seizing rivers and oceans, grasping clouds and suppressing mists. It forcefully flattened a surging wave that had swept towards him.

Yet, before he could catch his breath, a second wave crashed upon him.

"Good!"

The black-robed youth let out a long cry. His Heavenly Craft True Qi responded, manifesting various weapons—sabers, spears, swords, halberds—and even the bustling scene of a city, roaring as they met the second wave.

*Bang!*

With another loud bang, the black-robed youth's face flushed slightly, and he immediately staggered back a step. However, the incoming wave was shattered and subsequently calmed by his efforts.

But the waves on the cloud sea showed no sign of stopping. In fact, because the black-robed youth was circulating his spiritual power and drawing in the energies of heaven and earth, the previously calm cloud sea seemed provoked, becoming even more volatile. For the third time, it directly unleashed three waves, converging on him from different directions.

"Hmph!"

This time, the black-robed youth no longer moved with his previous ease. His face was flushed crimson, and his True Qi rapidly depleted as he continued to contend with the waves.

Neither side could suppress the other.

Witnessing this, the black-robed youth could only grit his teeth, change the hand seals, and slowly, step by step, rein in his originally vast, river-like spiritual power.

And strangely, as his spiritual power receded, the surging waves of the cloud sea also gradually diminished. Finally, along with the black-robed youth's fully retracted spiritual power, they returned to their original, tranquil state.

"Phew…"

The black-robed youth finally let out a sigh of relief. His body swayed, drained of all energy, unable even to stand steadily. He quickly urged his small boat to put some distance between himself and the cloud sea before taking out a medicinal pill. He consumed it, sat down to regulate his breathing, and only after a long while did he fully recover.

Just then, a light of evasion descended from the sky.

The light parted to reveal a handsome youth with a feather fan and a silk scarf, who gracefully landed on the boat. He smiled at the black-robed youth.

"Tianhe, your cultivation has grown."

"This 'Equilibrium Sea' encircles the entire Sacred Flame Cliff. It operates on the principle of 'as the water rises, the boat floats higher.' The more spiritual power you display, the larger the waves become."

"Even a disciple at the Perfection of Qi Condensation stage can't withstand a single wave."

"Even among us True Disciples, who have refined Third-grade True Qi, we can generally only withstand two waves. Only those with exceptionally refined spiritual power can contend with three waves."

"And Tianhe, your ability to resist four waves makes you a paragon even among True Disciples."

Facing the handsome youth's praise, the black-robed youth, Qin Tianhe, felt rather pleased but humbly shook his head. "It's merely because I'm a few years older."

"I've been a True Disciple for many years, and only now can I barely suppress four waves."

"They say that Yin Shan, back in the day, also possessed Third-grade True Qi, but he could suppress a full nine waves. It's said he was almost at the level of a Foundation Establishment Master."

Upon hearing this, the handsome youth's face also showed a look of admiration. "I've heard the sect elders say that only Foundation Establishment Masters can pass through the 'Equilibrium Sea' without stirring any waves. To reach such a realm, both status and True Qi are indispensable. One must at least have the ability to instantly suppress ten waves."

"Yin Shan being able to suppress nine waves in the past indeed meant he was close to the masters."

After a moment of shared感慨, Qin Tianhe looked curiously at the handsome youth. "Xu Xin, you always cultivate in your cave abode. What brings you here today?"

"You haven't received the news?"

Xu Xin seemed a little surprised. "The Four Great Orthodoxies are about to open another War for the Dao with our Sacred Sect. True Monarch Qingcheng Feixue has emerged from seclusion and is preparing to personally preside over this battle."

"The summons have already been sent out to all directions."

"Aside from us few True Disciples who are relatively free, many Qi Condensation disciples have also been recalled to the cloud sea, the weakest among them being at the late Qi Condensation stage."

"Oh, right, there's also a newcomer, quite unlucky, who happened to be promoted to True Disciple at this very moment."

"Oh?" Qin Tianhe raised an eyebrow at this, saying with interest, "Which newcomer? Who is the Master who values him?"

"It's said to be someone Yin Shan recommended."

At this, Xu Xin's expression suddenly turned a little strange. "However, as far as I know, that newcomer doesn't seem to have ever been to the Righteous-Demonic Battlefield."

"...Never been?"

Qin Tianhe frowned upon hearing this, then seemed to recall something, and a look of disgust appeared on his face. "Another person like Chen Xin'an?"

Among the Sacred Sect's True Disciples, there were also factional divisions.

Some True Disciples earned their spot by fighting on the Righteous-Demonic Battlefield, while others relied on their family elders, spending large sums and pulling strings to buy their positions.

The former, like Qin Tianhe and Xu Xin, detested the latter, believing these individuals were unworthy of their positions. The latter, like Chen Xin'an, who came from prestigious immortal families, likewise disdained Qin Tianhe and the like, considering them mere mud-legged commoners who were lucky to survive.

"I'm not sure."

Xu Xin shook his head, smiling. "But no matter what, in this upcoming War for the Dao, we'll see whether that newcomer is a mule or a horse. He'll have to prove himself."

"If he truly is as useless as Chen Xin'an, I won't mind teaching him a lesson, lest he messes things up in the War for the Dao and drags us down."

"Well said!"

Qin Tianhe nodded, no longer dwelling on it. Instead, he began to contemplate the imminent War for the Dao, his heart burning with fervor as he silently clenched his fists.

As a True Disciple from the battlefield faction, he had fought his way through the Righteous-Demonic Battlefield, enduring countless life-and-death situations to achieve his current standing. He had even survived two Wars for the Dao. If he won one more, he would have a fifty percent chance of attempting Foundation Establishment.

Therefore, this War for the Dao was a must-win for him!

Just then, a thunderous boom suddenly echoed from the distant cloud sea, as if a mighty thunderclap was rumbling through the sky, rushing from the far horizon.

"Someone's coming?"

Such a commotion immediately silenced Qin Tianhe and Xu Xin, who had been chatting animatedly. They looked in the direction of the sound, a hint of reverence in their eyes.

As the sound grew louder, their expressions became serious.

For the mere flight of an evasion light to generate thunder and cause such a massive stir, what level of spiritual power must the cultivator who unleashed it possess?

The next second, the evasion light arrived.

*Boom!*

The immense spiritual power instantly stirred the surrounding "Equilibrium Sea," creating a disturbance several times larger than the four waves Qin Tianhe had just created.

In an instant, a full ten waves surged into the sky.

Yet, before Xu Xin and Qin Tianhe could react, an even more enormous spiritual power descended from the heavens, directly striking the waves of the cloud sea with a single powerful force!

*Bang!*

Hundreds of miles of the cloud sea instantly returned to tranquility. All the waves seemed to be smoothed by an invisible giant hand, the clouds and mist parting to reveal a clear and graceful figure.

"Is this the place?"

Lu Yang surveyed his surroundings, finally spotting a small boat with two Sacred Sect disciples on it below in the cloud sea. He immediately descended his evasion light and approached.

"Two..."

Before Lu Yang could finish his sentence, Qin Tianhe and Xu Xin, who had just witnessed Lu Yang's power to suppress the cloud sea with a single burst of qi, immediately bowed down without a word:

"Disciple Qin Tianhe..."

"Disciple Xu Xin..."

"Greetings, Master!"
