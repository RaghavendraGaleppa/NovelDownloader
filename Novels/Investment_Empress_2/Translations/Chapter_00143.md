Chapter 143: Condensing the Xuan Dan, the Scorching Sun Burns the Heart!

Inside the room.

Li Mo took another Five Elements Purple Spirit Pill, silently sensing his current physical condition.

The tangled meridians had been completely smoothed out. The nine-petaled lotus in his Dantian shimmered with a soft glow, wrapping around the Xuan Dan that had not yet fully condensed.

"My current state is even better than before."

Li Mo felt it was time to condense his Xuan Dan.

He lined up various pills to deal with any sudden emergencies. He also checked his remaining Martial Dao Insight allowance and couldn't help but feel a surge of pride.

Eight hundred and sixty years.

That was the lifespan of more than a dozen ordinary lifetimes.

With his newfound wealth, the young master Li took out the golden page.

He possessed a Small World.

Therefore, he planned to attempt condensing his Dan using the *Zhou Tian Xing Dou Xuan Dan Jing* while still in the Internal Breath Realm.

**[20 years of Martial Dao Insight injected successfully.]**

**[Year 1: You sit silently before the golden page. By chance, you discover it can reflect the celestial constellations. Using 365 Xuan Dans, one can construct 365 main stars within one's own Internal Space.]**

**[Year 10: You continuously calculate the profound trajectories of the 365 main stars. However, the changes in the Zhou Tian Xing Dou are infinite, and you struggle to grasp even a fraction of their mystery.]**

**[Year 20: You finally understand that one must use the Sun and Moon as the foundation...]**

**[Deduction complete. You have grasped the basics of the *Zhou Tian Xing Dou Xuan Dan Jing*.]**

"Not bad."

Li Mo nodded to himself.

After all, this was a technique on the same level as the *Karma Fire Red Lotus Wondrous Method*. Gaining entry in twenty years was actually quite impressive.

"So it's because this method becomes increasingly difficult the further one goes."

"The more Xuan Dans there are in the later stages, the difficulty multiplies."

A sudden realization rose in his heart.

After a moment of contemplation, he swallowed a Seven-Striped Pill dropped by Princess Xiao Jiang.

**Heaven and Man Unity activated!**

A vortex seemed to grow on the nine-petaled lotus in his Dantian, greedily devouring the spiritual energy of the pill, and even drawing power from the heavens and the earth.

Once the energy entered the Dantian, it was frantically refined.

In the small room, the void trembled, and the commotion grew larger and larger.

At this moment, Li Mo's consciousness sank into the World Seed.

In the sky of the World Seed.

A great sun was slowly rising.

It enveloped the shadow of a lotus, frantically swallowing and spitting out spiritual energy, gradually growing stronger and more solid.

It was getting closer and closer to reality.

...

Meanwhile.

In the not-so luxurious main hall of the Li Mansion, those seated were figures capable of shaking the Ziyang Prefecture, and even the Eastern Wilderness Region.

High-ranking members of the Qingyuan Sect, the Fenyu Forest, the Gangdou Sect, and the Chijing Gang were all present.

The seat at the head was empty.

It was reserved for Shangwen Cang.

In the battle two days ago, this Sect Master of Qingyuan, who rarely made a move, displayed power close to that of a Law Body, surpassing the scope of a Prefecture-level force. It was natural that he should occupy the highest seat.

"Please, Sect Master Shangwen."

A voice came from outside, and everyone turned their heads.

Shangwen Cang and several elders of the Qingyuan Sect walked in, along with a girl of sixteen or seventeen.

She walked through the main hall and naturally sat down.

Hmm. She sat in the head seat.

The Ice Cube was purely acting out of habit...

In her previous life, when holding the Nine Heavens Assembly in the桂 Palace, even the Great Yu Emperor had to sit below her.

Everyone: ".....Who is she?"

The utterly embarrassed Shangwen Cang: "....."

Why does it feel like she fits perfectly in that seat with her aura?

Sensing everyone's eyes.

Hmm?

Ying Bing frowned slightly. Her cold gaze swept calmly over the crowd, making people instinctively want to lower their heads...

*Scram—*

A Inner Scene expert suddenly stood up, standing as straight as a board.

"Why are you standing?"

"Uh, I've been sitting too long, my butt is uncomfortable,咳..."

The Inner Scene expert sat back down sheepishly.

It was strange. That girl was only in the Internal Breath Realm, yet sitting at the same table with her made him feel unworthy.

"Gentlemen, did you manage to ask the disciples of your respective sects about the detailed events inside the秘境?" Shangwen Cang sat on a stool brought by a servant and spoke slowly.

"I asked."

"I asked too, but I suspect he was telling me a story."

"Huh? You guys had the same situation?"

"It's strange. When I asked my disciple, he was also talking nonsense, as if possessed."

---

"Exactly. Internal Breath fighting Inner Scene, haha. If that were true, I'd eat this table right now."

"My nephew came back chanting that he wants to recognize that Li... Mo, as his big brother. My Gangdou Sect disciples are unyielding; when have we ever recognized someone else as a big brother?!"

The high-ranking members spoke indignantly, but as they talked, they realized something was off.

Why were the things their disciples said so similar?

It couldn't be that they conspired beforehand to fool them, right?

But what was even more ridiculous was the content of what they said.

"Ying Bing, you were a firsthand witness. Since this concerns the Demon Summoning Cult, please tell everyone about the process."

Shangwen Cang looked to the side.

Ying Bing put down her tea cup and spoke softly. Her unhurried tone was naturally convincing.

Of course, she glossed over things that shouldn't be mentioned, such as the Blood Phoenix Essence.

Only then did the events that occurred in the秘境 become clear.

"Han Zhen? The Grand Tutor of the Great Shang Dynasty who survived to this day through strange means?"

"The restoration of the Great Shang Dynasty?"

"That Blood Phoenix秘境 turned out to be the Internal Space of a Pervasive Mystery Realm expert?"

...

The people in the hall grew more terrified as they listened, sweating profusely.

This matter was too big.

They had unknowingly waded into such troubled waters.

The elder of the Gangdou Sect, who looked like a middle-aged blacksmith, noticed something odd.

"But the Grand Tutor of the Great Shang Dynasty plotted for so long, yet there were so few casualties in this Blood Phoenix秘境?"

This was very confusing.

"You and Li Mo... blocked Yin Huaxuan and Han Zhen?"

"Hmm."

Receiving Ying Bing's confirmation.

Everyone looked at each other, their faces filled with hesitation.

"My disciple possesses dual Xuan Dans, and by chance, she formed a connection with Han Zhen's supreme treasure. This allowed her to gain the upper hand."

"Although Han Zhen has a great background, he is currently only at the Observation of the Divine Realm at best."

Shangwen Cang's voice rang out.

Dual Xuan Dans?

Everyone was stunned, momentarily at a loss for words.

Looking up.

Suddenly, a stunning sword intent横空, as if freezing everything, making their souls tremble with fear.

When they came to their senses, they felt that breathtaking sword strike was like a dream, as if it never existed.

"What kind of sword art is this?"

Aside from shock, everyone was just shocked. Looking at Ying Bing again, they all swallowed their saliva.

This sword intent could indeed injure Inner Scene experts.

At such a young age, such sword intent, dual Xuan Dans...

"With this girl, the Qingyuan Sect will likely dominate the Cloud State Martial Dao Summit."

They all had this thought simultaneously.

What about in a few years, when she grows up?

By then, the Qingyuan Sect might even lead the way to glory under her command, becoming an existence they could only look up to.

"By the way, how did that秘境 shatter?"

Someone else asked gently.

Ying Bing picked up her tea again:

"Li Mo shattered it."

"Who is Li Mo..."

"I know him. This child is helpful and kind-hearted. Several of my subordinates received his help."

"But isn't he at the Jade Liquid Realm?"

Internal Breath Jade Liquid Realm, which is mid-Internal Breath.

His realm is even lower than Ying Bing's.

Shattering the Internal Space of a Pervasive Mystery Realm expert, even one that had been depleted for a long time, was simply too absurd.

*Rumble—*

Just at that moment.

A massive aura radiated through the void.

That aura was filled with a destructive meaning of extreme Yang, and it was continuously growing stronger.

Who doesn't have a few shameful secrets in their heart?

But now, under the influence of this aura, they felt a sensation of a scorching sun burning their hearts, igniting from the depths of their souls.

Under the sunlight, nothing could hide!

In their shock, everyone released their own domains to resist, then looked toward the center of the aura.

What the hell happened?

Ying Bing stood up. Through the window, she seemed to see a certain figure in the distance.

She wasn't surprised.

Because she had sensed it during their dual cultivation.

"He is about to condense his Xuan Dan."
