# Chapter 318: A Single Arrow

A window lattice trembling three hundred zhang away in a waterside pavilion. The faint hum of a sword hidden within a bamboo basket by a street vendor. Even the trajectory of air currents stirred by a swift's wings as it beat them in the clouds.

All things were revealed in exquisite detail.

Xu Yunfan's eyes snapped open, and his Sea of Consciousness mirrored his movement, his spirit hand rising in perfect synchrony.

The Sky-Piercing Cloud-Shattering Bow slid from his shoulder into his palm. The dark patterns on the bow's body blazed with a piercing silver light. This vicious weapon, unseen for three hundred years, let out a hungry tremor as Xu Yunfan channeled his Pure Yang True Qi, a massive torrent of energy pouring into it.

The moment his right hand gripped the bowstring, the blacksteel arrow, under the simultaneous eruption of Pure Yang True Qi and the triple force of the Ten Extreme Martial Dao, emitted a dark light.

*Thrum!*

The bowstring's vibration was like a thunderclap. The instant the arrow left the string, it sucked the air within a hundred-zhang radius into a vacuum!

The arrow shaft was wreathed in a spiral of air. Roof tiles were torn away from buildings along its path. The three-hundred-zhang distance was covered in an instant.

Inside the top floor of the waterside pavilion, several figures were leaning on the railing, observing the Longfeng Tavern. The leading, yin柔-looking man was about to speak when a chill ran down his spine. He looked up sharply.

"What is that?!"

Before he could finish, a dark light, coiled in a spiral of air, had already torn through the sky.

Before the arrowhead even arrived, the violent air pressure had already pulverized the window lattice.

The old man in the purple robe on the left had his pupils constrict violently. The teacup in his hand shattered with a *crack*.

"We can't dodge it!" he roared. The muscles on his body bulged, and a turtle-shell pattern of qi energy lit up around him. But the moment it touched the arrow's light, it shattered like thin paper.

The youth in the brocade robe's expression twisted, the calm, in-control look he had worn just moments ago completely collapsing.

"I can't die!"

"Retreat!" the yin柔-looking man shouted. Before the word had even left his lips, he had already turned into a shadow and was shooting backward.

However, the moment the arrow pierced into the pavilion, a lingering tremor of the bowstring, like the tolling of a death knell, echoed in their ears. The moment the arrowhead touched the railing, time seemed to freeze.

They saw the wooden pillars turn to sawdust without a sound, the glazed roof tiles rain down upside down, and their own robes tear into a spiderweb of cracks by the airwaves...

*BOOM!*

A half-breath later, the roar of destruction swallowed everything. Their terrified expressions had not even faded before they were consumed by collapsing beams and twisting floorboards. The yin柔-looking man's last glimpse was of the arrow's remaining force tearing through a faraway iron gate before his consciousness sank completely into darkness.

The top floor of the waterside pavilion, at the moment of impact, was like being devoured by an invisible beast. Half of the pavilion collapsed with a deafening crash. What was even more terrifying was that the arrow's force had not been spent. It shot through the ruins and continued to tear through seven more buildings along its path, finally boring a bowl-sized hole in the outer city's iron gate. The fletching at the arrow's tail was still vibrating at a high frequency, spreading the cracks in the gate over a three-zhang area!

In the dust and smoke, Xu Yunfan stood holding his bow, gazing coldly at the end of the arrow's trajectory.

Just as Xu Yunfan took a step, he suddenly felt the air around him stagnate, as if the entire world had been imprisoned by some invisible force.

His eyes were deep and profound, his emotions without a single ripple. He looked up sharply.

A woman in a dark palace gown stood silently seven feet in front of him, her toes lightly touching the void as if stepping on water without a trace. Her figure was slender, her black hair half-pinned up with a golden phoenix hairpin. The loose strands of hair fluttered in the wind, each one seeming to contain a森然 sword intent.

Her face was carved like cold jade, a dot of cinnabar between her brows like blood, making her long, narrow phoenix eyes seem even more profound. Her eyes seemed to hold a galaxy in reverse, yet they were so cold they held no emotion. With just a faint glance, Xu Yunfan felt his entire body's qi and blood sink into a mire, and even his Pure Yang True Qi had stagnated by three-tenths.

"Within the Jade Capital, acting so rashly. You deserve to be executed."

Her voice was cold when she spoke, the end of her words carrying a clang like metal striking stone. With a light sweep of her wide sleeves, the ninefold cloud patterns subtly embroidered on her cuffs glowed with a faint light. The fallen leaves within ten zhang of her froze in mid-air, their edges condensing into a frosty, blade-like chill.

The frost blades, like a cascade of light, transformed into a sky full of cold stars as her sword finger lightly traced the air, pouring down towards Xu Yunfan. Each frost blade was as solid as a physical object. Wherever its edge passed, the air was actually sliced open, leaving fine ice marks, and even the light was distorted.

Xu Yunfan's waist bent slightly, his entire body's qi and blood boiling like molten rock. The scales of his dragon-scale armor clanged and quivered. The blood energy swirling around him, as the frost blades approached, was actually frozen into crimson ice crystals, which crumbled and fell away. His expression in the 'Lin' state was without a trace of panic. The Pure Yang True Qi in his body circulated frantically, but it was still suppressed by that森然 sword intent, making it hard to move even an inch.

Yet in such an environment, he still unwaveringly grasped the Zhenyue Hanhai Hammer, activating the power of the earth's veins to merge with his dragon-scale armor.

However, just as the frost blades were about to enter the three-zhang radius around Xu Yunfan, the void suddenly trembled.

*Sss!*

All the frost blades, as if falling into a furnace, vaporized and vanished in the blink of an eye, not even leaving a speck of ice behind.

"Sword Master of the Celestial Pivot, Su Wanqing."

A苍老 yet powerful voice descended from the clouds. "Many years have passed. This technique of condensing qi into swords of yours is even more overbearing than that of the old fogies in the Sword Pavilion."

The sound had not yet arrived, but its imposing manner had already arrived first. The entire world seemed to have been gently stroked by an invisible great hand. The originally stagnant spiritual energy suddenly surged like a tide. Xu Yunfan felt his whole body lighten. The chilling intent that had been pressing down on him, making it hard to move, melted away silently, like snow meeting the blazing sun.

He looked up sharply and saw a disheveled figure standing on the air. His tattered Daoist robes fluttered in the wind, but he was surrounded by nine layers of innate vital energy. Each layer was like a scorching sun hanging in the sky, illuminating the clouds within a hundred zhang with a golden glow!

Dao Sect's Bi Sheng!

Xu Yunfan exited the 'Lin' state and the heart-flow state. The corner of his mouth twitched almost imperceptibly. He looked at the disheveled old Daoist standing in front of him and almost couldn't hold back a laugh. Who would have thought that the old man who had been scolded bloody by his master, Bi Yuan, and locked in confinement three times, would now become his protector?

He suppressed the urge to laugh to the skies, and Bi Yuan's instructions when he left the sect flashed through his mind: "Do what you want. If the sky falls, there are high people to hold it up." At the time, he had guessed that the Dao Sect would have a Grandmaster of the Ninth Realm secretly following him. He just never expected that this "high person" would be the old Daoist Bi Sheng, who had misjudged him at first and then came back with a sycophantic face!

But the one he hadn't expected was actually Bi Sheng.

Bi Sheng seemed to sense something and turned his head to glare at him. The old face, red from the fumes of alcohol, was now filled with a gnashing expression. "I should call you my ancestor! On your first day in the Jade Capital, you shoot down half a street. Do you think this is the archery range behind the Dao Sect's mountain?!"

Xu Yunfan blinked innocently, a smiling expression on his face without saying a word. The Great Zhou now was not what it used to be. Even if the Dao Sect wanted a fight, they wouldn't be afraid.

The old Daoist's thin fingers in his sleeve curled slightly. He felt an urge to hit someone when he saw Xu Yunfan's face. An urge to punch someone. When that arrow had pierced the air just now, he had clearly seen the trajectory tearing through the sky. It was truly unforgettable...

"Brat," Bi Sheng suddenly lowered his voice, a hint of admiration flashing through his turbid eyes. "That arrow had a bit of the 'Sky-Splitting Bow's' flair."

Seeing the two of them winking and gesturing at each other, the cold light in Su Wanqing's eyes suddenly intensified. Her dark palace gown stirred without wind, and the ninefold cloud patterns on her cuffs began to glow with a piercing silver light.
