# Chapter 12: Obtaining Spirit Stones  

Old Lin had long sensed that Zhang Yan was no ordinary person.  

From his temperament alone, it was clear he was someone destined for greatness. Coupled with the extraordinary comprehension ability he'd displayed, even if his innate talent was lacking, Old Lin had no doubt Zhang Yan would achieve remarkable things.  

But...  

The rise he'd envisioned was something that would take ten, perhaps even several decades. After years of tempering, with such comprehension skills, Zhang Yan would surely soar to great heights.  

Yet, who could have predicted this?  

In such a short time!  

Zhang Yan, a grassroots cultivator, had already caught the attention of an inner sect deacon—even being recommended to the deacon's master!  

Who was the master of an inner sect deacon?  

A Golden Core elder!  

A being standing at the very pinnacle of the sect.  

His rise was too fast!  

And the heights he was reaching were too staggering!  

He was only at the first level of Qi Refinement!  

How could he already command such attention?  

Old Lin could only sigh.  

The world of geniuses was truly beyond the comprehension of ordinary folk like them.  

Meanwhile, Lin Qiuying was so ashamed she wished she could vanish into the ground.  

Just moments ago, she had been bullying him, relying on her status as an inner sect disciple.  

Little did she know that for him, entering the inner sect was as easy as picking something from a bag.  

The worst part was that he hadn't even bothered to refute her—simply ignoring her existence altogether.  

Humiliation.  

This was sheer, unadulterated humiliation.  

"Since Senior Brother is here, why don’t I prepare a meal so we can talk over food?"  

Glancing at the sky, Zhang Yan extended an invitation to Mu Sen.  

"That would be fine."  

Mu Sen nodded.  

"However, I don’t have any spirit wine or dishes here—only mundane food. I hope Senior Brother won’t mind."  

"It’s no trouble. To be honest, it’s been a while since I’ve had mortal food. I’ve actually missed it a little." Mu Sen waved it off, showing no concern.  

Zhang Yan didn’t take his words at face value. Cultivators, especially those who had reached Foundation Establishment, could sustain themselves without food. Even when they did eat, they preferred spirit wine and delicacies.  

Ordinary food was rarely consumed.  

Mu Sen was only saying this to spare Zhang Yan’s feelings.  

The Spirit Herb Garden had all the necessary utensils ready.  

Before long, with the help of Old Lin and Lin Qiuying, Zhang Yan prepared a lavish meal.  

Though Lin Qiuying’s attitude remained frosty, Old Lin had always treated him well. Sharing a meal with a Foundation Establishment expert was a small way to repay that kindness.  

Old Lin understood this well and repeatedly expressed his gratitude throughout the meal.  

---  

With the food prepared, they set the table in the Spirit Herb Garden.  

The evening breeze carried the fragrance of plants, and the sight of the homely dishes on the table softened the atmosphere.  

Mu Sen spoke little during the meal.  

Only after they had eaten their fill and Old Lin had left with Lin Qiuying did Mu Sen finally open up.  

"Don’t plant the spirit herb seeds I gave you just yet. They require spiritual energy to grow. Moreover, each herb thrives in specific conditions. Here—this is a basic guide to cultivating spirit herbs. Study it first."  

With that, he handed over a book.  

The book looked aged, its pages yellowed and covered in densely written notes and corrections. The handwriting matched Mu Sen’s from the Enlightenment Hall—clearly, he had written it himself.  

This was an invaluable treasure.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother Mu!"  

Zhang Yan bowed deeply.  

"Alright, I’ve told you all you need to know for now. Your priority is to cultivate diligently and master the Wood Element Technique."  

"Understood!"  

Zhang Yan nodded firmly.  

"I will master the Wood Element Technique within the allotted time!"  

"Good. That’s all, then."  

Once everything was settled, Mu Sen departed.  

Without hesitation, Zhang Yan returned to his wooden hut.  

He had no time to waste—cultivation came first.  

---  

Meanwhile, Old Lin and Lin Qiuying were whispering among themselves.  

"Are you really not going to try again?" Old Lin sighed.  

"Like I said, we live in different worlds." Lin Qiuying’s face twisted with bitterness.  

She had just finished declaring how their worlds didn’t align—only to realize the truth was far worse.  

It wasn’t that Zhang Yan couldn’t enter her world.  

It was that she couldn’t even fathom his.  

"What a shame. I thought Zhang Yan’s rise would take at least a decade or two. By then, he’d be mature, and there might have been a chance for you. But who could’ve expected…"  

Old Lin sighed again.  

There had been an opportunity.  

But Lin Qiuying had ruined it herself.  

Now, regret was useless.  

---  

Zhang Yan, of course, remained unaware of their conversation.  

Or rather, he simply didn’t care.  

Time flew, and half a month passed in the blink of an eye.  

During this time, he had been wholly focused on cultivation, farming, and mastering his techniques.  

The Evergreen Art had reached Minor Mastery, rendering its jade slip obsolete.  

The Wood Element Technique had also improved, though it was still far from Major Mastery.  

He wasn’t worried, though.  

With the Enlightenment Cushion, achieving Major Mastery was only a matter of time.  

Today, Old Lin’s spirit rice was ready for harvest.  

Zhang Yan helped gather the crops, and together they took the yield to the sect’s Administration Hall.  

After delivering the sect’s share, they sold their own portion, netting Zhang Yan thirty spirit stones—his first real capital.  

"Old Lin, I’ll be going my own way from now on."  

At the Administration Hall, Zhang Yan bid the old man farewell.  

Now that he was a Qi Refinement cultivator with spirit stones to his name, he could cultivate his own spirit fields.  

After parting ways, he headed straight to the sect’s Resource Hall to lease a hundred acres of spirit fields.  

But upon arrival, he discovered a problem.  

The sect had plenty of spirit fields—but even more spirit farmers.  

This made sense.  

Becoming a spirit farmer required the least resources, and it was a path that could eventually lead to becoming a spirit botanist—a profession with decent prospects.  

As a result, spirit farmers were the most numerous in the sect.  

This led to fierce competition for fields.  

Though the sect tried to ensure every disciple had land to cultivate, the rules were strict:  

At the first level of Qi Refinement, he could only lease ten acres.  

Far too little for his needs.  

"Want more land? That’s possible—if you’re a spirit botanist. Then you could lease a hundred acres, or even more."  

The Resource Hall disciple eyed Zhang Yan with impatience.  

He had little tolerance for weaklings with unrealistic demands.  

"A spirit botanist can lease more fields?"  

Zhang Yan’s lips curled into a smile.
