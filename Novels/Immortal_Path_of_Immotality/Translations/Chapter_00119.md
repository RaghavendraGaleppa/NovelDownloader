# Chapter 119: The Might of the Lord

In the blink of an eye, Lin Shan wasted no time on pleasantries with Elder Xiongshan. He immediately summoned the black iron flying sword—a high-grade magical artifact issued by the Black Lotus Sect—and with a swift flick of his divine sense, the sword descended from the sky like lightning, arriving in an instant.

Elder Xiongshan let out a strange cry as an identical silver flying sword shot out from the storage pouch at his waist, intercepting the incoming blade with a series of rapid parries.

*Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!*

Sparks flew as the two engaged in a fierce aerial duel, their swords clashing dozens of times in mere moments. There was no finesse or technique—only deadly strikes aimed to kill.

Before coming to the East Sea, Lin Shan had mentally prepared himself for sect infighting. However, after joining the Black Lotus Sect, his previous worldview had been shaken. Yet Elder Xiongshan's actions had just dragged him back to reality.

The demonic path was the demonic path!

Outside the sect, it was kill or be killed. If you didn't kill others, they would kill you—especially since Elder Xiongshan had already set his sights on him.

Seeing the two locked in combat, the Black and Red Twins didn't dare hesitate despite their injuries. They gritted their teeth and joined the fray to assist Elder Xiongshan.

Black Twin threw out a handful of paper cranes, which fluttered to life midair, growing in size as they screeched and charged at Lin Shan with sharp beaks. Red Twin scattered a handful of beans on the ground, which transformed into wooden puppets that rolled upright and fired beams of emerald light.

From his position in the sky, Lin Shan continued his swordplay with Elder Xiongshan while simultaneously swinging his Five-Elements Fan toward the twins.

Two radiant streams of energy surged forth, their properties shifting mid-flight. The left transformed into a blaze of fire, incinerating the paper cranes to ashes. The right became a storm of golden arrows, shredding the wooden puppets into splinters.

The Black and Red Twins were dumbfounded. After years of mastering their puppet-summoning techniques, this was the first time their combined efforts had been obliterated in a single move.

*Was it just a coincidence that his fan perfectly countered their elements?*

Refusing to accept defeat, the brothers summoned dozens of translucent jellyfish that spat venom skyward. They then brandished a two-meter-long banner, unleashing a flock of fire crows that cawed menacingly as they flapped their blazing wings toward Lin Shan.

Without even glancing their way, Lin Shan waved his fan again.

Two more radiant streams descended. The left morphed into an earthen mountain, crushing the jellyfish beneath its weight. The right transformed into a tidal wave, extinguishing the fire crows in a single splash.

Earth countered water. Water countered fire.

The Five-Elements Fan—renowned throughout the cultivation world as one of the pinnacle artifacts alongside the Five-Elements Robe—was no mere legend.

No matter what attack came his way, the fan could adapt its elemental properties to counter it.  

In other words, it countered *everything*.

The Black and Red Twins coughed up blood in frustration. *This was just bullying!*

Black Twin's expression darkened as he pulled out a gourd, uncorking it to release billowing green smoke. *Fine, no more playing with elements. Let’s see how you handle decades' worth of refined poison!*

Lin Shan merely shifted his hand seals, casting a *Gale Spell*.

The tranquil island was suddenly battered by hurricane-force winds. Sand and stones whipped through the air as the poisonous smoke was blown back toward the twins.

Horrified, the two scrambled to erect protective barriers, hastily activating talismans and defensive artifacts. They even gulped down antidote pills preemptively.

Elder Xiongshan, still locked in a deadly sword dance with Lin Shan, was furious. His two allies had not only failed to help but had managed to poison themselves. *What kind of useless teammates were they?*

Meanwhile, the twins were too busy dealing with their own poison to care. They sat cross-legged, frantically consuming antidotes while circulating their qi to expel the toxins.

Lin Shan smirked and fanned leisurely in their direction. Every defensive measure they took was effortlessly countered—metal barriers melted under fire, fire barriers drowned in water, water barriers buried under earth.

The five-colored radiance of the fan's feathers shimmered hypnotically, leaving Lin Shan's subordinates in awe. *Such an overpowered artifact defied all reason.*

Seizing the moment Lin Shan was distracted, Elder Xiongshan finally managed to create some distance. Seeing the twins on the verge of collapse, he retrieved a set of *Soul-Seeking Mother-Child Nails* from his storage pouch.

The mother nail, palm-sized and pitch-black, gleamed with a sinister purple tip. The five child nails, each thumb-sized and entirely purple, emitted faint wisps of toxic smoke.

Lin Shan shuddered at the sight. *Why were these people so obsessed with poison? Weren’t they afraid of accidentally poisoning themselves?*

In half a breath, Elder Xiongshan—whose mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation granted him superior divine sense—multitasked effortlessly. While maintaining his swordplay, he launched the six nails in a plum-blossom formation toward Lin Shan.

But instead of panicking, Lin Shan simply summoned a palm-sized bronze mirror that intercepted every nail.

*Clink! Clink! Clink!*

The nails bounced off the *Cloud-Copper Heartguard Mirror*, leaving behind six pockmarks where the poison corroded the surface. Yet Lin Shan remained unfazed. When Left Elder had given him this artifact, it had already been battered from years of use. But as a top-tier defensive treasure inscribed with five layers of protective runes, its durability was unmatched.

Elder Xiongshan tried maneuvering the nails from different angles, but the mirror intercepted every attack. His frustration grew. *How did a mere early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator possess not only the Five-Elements Fan but also a top-tier defensive artifact?*

Determined, he unleashed a set of twelve mid-grade flying needles. Knowing they couldn’t breach Lin Shan’s defenses, he instead targeted the cloud carrying Lin Shan’s subordinates.

*If I can’t kill you, I’ll slaughter your lackeys. Let’s see how you like that!*

But Lin Shan remained unshaken. While the mirror blocked the nails and his flying sword pressured Elder Xiongshan, he occasionally flicked his fan toward the twins for good measure.

The cloud, formed by the high-grade artifact *Descending Cloud Banner*, had its own defenses. The barrage of needles only elicited startled cries from Lin Shan’s men before being harmlessly absorbed by the soft mist.

Elder Xiongshan’s eyes nearly bulged out of his skull. *Four high-grade artifacts—three of them top-tier—on a mere early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator? What kind of monster was this?!*

High above, Lin Shan cut a striking figure—dressed in white, one hand guiding his flying sword, the other lazily fanning himself—exuding effortless grace.

His subordinates watched in awe, chanting praises of *"The Lord’s might!"* The earlier needle assault had terrified them, but their leader had blocked it with ease. Now, watching him single-handedly dominate three opponents, their admiration soared.

Lin Shan had brought them not just to clean up the battlefield and reclaim Red Prawn Island but also to showcase his strength.

In the cultivation world, power commanded respect. Today’s display would cement their loyalty.

But he wasn’t about to let them spectate idly. Directing the *Descending Cloud Banner* to hover ten meters above the poisoned twins, he barked, *"What are you waiting for? They’re sitting ducks! Attack!"*

Snapping to attention, the subordinates unleashed a chaotic barrage—low-grade artifacts, elemental spells, corrosive acids, even swarms of bizarre insects—raining down on the helpless twins.

The sheer volume was overwhelming, if not particularly lethal.
