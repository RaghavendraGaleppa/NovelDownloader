**Chapter 15: The Saint? The Demon?**

In an unknown space, gloom was the dominant hue. Black winds howled high above, and the land stretched like a desolate, parched beach. The reddish-yellow earth was riddled with ravines, strewn with gigantic skeletons. Half a skull, comparable to an ancient divine mountain, was covered in cracks. A spine, piercing the sky like a sharp sword, lay beside a sword domain; even after countless years of demise, the sword intent etched deep into its bones remained unextinguished.

At the heart of this land, surrounded by countless skeletal remains, a radiant white light shimmered. Within the white light stood a palace with glazed jade tiles, ethereal runes coiling around it. Divine herbs and immortal flowers exuded a faint fragrance. Thumb-sized flower sprites fluttered among the blossoms, their silver-bell-like laughter echoing. White pegasi with single horns trod through the air, their hooves creating ripples, making the place seem like a sacred land.

Upon the palace steps sat a white-haired youth, clad in simple white robes, a gentle smile gracing his face, instantly inspiring goodwill. In his hand, he held a handful of faintly shimmering, crystalline particles. A palm-sized, nine-tailed, multi-colored phoenix descended from the sky, landing softly in his palm to peck at the small granules.

"Why is Zhou Tian still alive? Didn't you tell me you succeeded?" the white-haired youth spoke softly, his voice faint, as if afraid to disturb the holy beast feeding in his hand.

Not far in front of him stood two black-robed figures—the very same two who had set up the grand array and cursed Zhou Tian to death that day. Upon hearing the white-haired youth's words, despite his saintly, sagely appearance, the two figures trembled as if standing before an ancient great demon. With a thud, they knelt to the ground, beads of sweat the size of broad beans dripping onto the earth, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.

One of them spoke: "Saint, please give us another chance... Last time, the power might not have been enough... please, another chance... Saint..."

"Hush!" The white-haired youth placed a finger to his lips and whispered, "Quiet down, don't startle them..." He finished, gesturing towards the flower fairies who had scurried into the depths of the flower bushes, startled. "Don't be afraid. If the power wasn't enough, just expand the array. That's not the problem... what saddens me is that you deceived me."

The white-haired youth rose to his feet, the nine-tailed multi-colored phoenix hopping onto his shoulder. His gaze deepened as he looked into the distance, sighing. Upon hearing this, the two kneeling figures trembled even more violently, yet dared not make a single move, their heads lowered even further.

Just then, a black glint flashed in the white-haired youth's eyes. Overwhelming demonic energy erupted from him. His pristine white saintly robes turned black, and twisted faces appeared on them, struggling to escape. The entire palace was tainted, turning crimson, as boundless evil energy permeated the air. The immortal flowers transformed into black demonic blossoms, exuding faint resentful auras. The flower fairies turned completely black, holding various instruments of torture, their expressions vicious as they stared at the two kneeling figures. The white unicorn pegasi burst into pale white flames, becoming demonic nightmares. The nine-tailed multi-colored phoenix turned black, emitting a horrifying shriek. Each of its nine tails was bound with a shrunken head—some furious, some hateful, some pained—releasing boundless resentment. The sacred land instantly transformed into a demonic lair.

The white-haired youth, now brimming with demonic energy, looked at the two kneeling figures. A cold glint flashed in his eyes. With a wave of his hand, energy gathered, runes flickered, and two amethyst-like long spears tore through space, piercing out from the bodies of the two men. They carried two dark shadows, pinning them to the ground nearby. Streaks of lightning pulsed on the amethyst spears, and the dark shadows twitched relentlessly upon them.

"Esteemed Demon... please... please... give us another chance..." The two dark shadows pinned by the amethyst spears spoke, revealing themselves to be the souls of the two men. Their address to the white-haired youth had also changed. Though their souls had been extracted and pinned to the ground, the two men breathed a sigh of relief. It was good that Esteemed Demon had emerged. While Esteemed Demon was ruthless in his actions, he was straightforward. If he said he would kill them, he would; if he said he would release them, he would. But Esteemed Saint was different; he wouldn't kill, but he would make them wish they were dead!

"Hmph!" The white-haired youth snorted coldly, his demonic might surging. His voice boomed like a great bell, shaking the very void until it almost shattered. "If I didn't want to give you a chance, you would already be taken as the Saint's toys!"

The white-haired youth waved his hand again. The amethyst spears flew back, carrying the souls pinned to them back into their respective bodies. Their previously lifeless bodies jolted, and they spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. Yet, they dared not tend to their injuries. The two men hurriedly spoke, "Thank you, Esteemed Demon."

"I will give you ten times the resources of last time. Go and experiment for me again! If you don't succeed next time, you can go and 'follow the Saint'!" The white-haired youth said coldly. His threat to the two wasn't eternal torture, but the four words "follow the Saint," as if these four words were more terrifying than "death" or "torture"!

"Yes... yes!" The two men quickly responded.

Holy light blossomed once more, and the area returned to being a sacred land on earth. The nine-tailed multi-colored phoenix let out a clear cry, soaring into the sky, trailing a swath of sacred light. The white-haired youth let out a faint sigh: "The Demon is simply too ruthless with his actions!" He casually waved out two streaks of sacred light. A faint chanting sound arose, and the holy light entered the two men's bodies, healing their injuries.

"Thank... thank you... Saint!" Feeling the warm, comfortable sensation spreading from deep within their bodies, the two men still thanked him tremblingly.

"Alright, alright, don't be afraid. The Demon has gone back; he won't harm you anymore. Hurry, leave..." The white-haired youth looked at the two trembling figures on the ground, speaking with an air of profound compassion.

"Yes, yes..." The two men tremblingly stood up, bowed, and retreated backward, not daring to look up. After retreating for a considerable distance, they finally soared into the sky, transforming into two streams of light and leaving the place.

After the two men left, the white-haired youth stood for a long time before speaking aloud, as if conversing with another presence within himself: "You just let those two go?"

...

"Indeed, that grand array was verified by us and proven feasible, but those two also messed up this mission."

...

"True, they've operated it once, they have experience. Let them try again. But if they don't succeed next time, they'll be my toys!"

...

"Then that's fine..."

The white-haired youth murmured to himself. Flower fairies frolicked in the bushes, unicorn pegasi licked dew from the blossoms, and the phoenix circled in the sky, trailing divine rainbows, as if all the beauty of the human world resided here.

As this news spread from the Imperial Capital, the Imperial Palace also stirred. Although on the surface the Imperial Family appeared unresponsive to Zhou Tian's matter, in reality, the entire Imperial Family had secretly mobilized. The Imperial Family's elders were no fools; they could see that this matter was not simple. It was they who had intentionally released the news, to "beat the grass to startle the snake"! They wanted to see exactly who dared to challenge this ancient empire!
