# Chapter 52: Correspondence

The Qingfu Temple possessed maps and records of the mountain forests, but these hadn't been updated since the turmoil decades ago and were far from comprehensive. According to Fuso, many documents had been destroyed during those chaotic times.

Zhou Qing organized hunters to gather information about the deep mountains, intending to cross-verify both sources. Additionally, there had been strange disappearances of hunters in the mountains over the past year, making those who ventured in more cautious than before. Consequently, their observations should be more detailed than usual.

This was just one of his preparations for future herb-gathering expeditions into the mountains.

The *Spring Restoration Talisman Manual* contained a dedicated section on herb gathering. The lightness technique from the Crane Form was designed for this purpose, though Zhou Qing now had the Shadowless Kick, which was even more suitable. Moreover, the Bear, Bird, and Ape Forms themselves were useful for navigating steep and treacherous terrain, particularly the Ape Form, which included specific postures that enhanced climbing ability.

The herb-gathering section also mentioned specialized equipment. One was a claw-like device launched by a crossbow mechanism, called the "Crossbow Claw," somewhat similar to Batman's grappling gun. However, without sufficient mastery of lightness techniques, it was unusable, and it demanded immense arm strength. Crafting the crossbow was extremely complex—components had to be meticulously made and assembled with precision, requiring both dexterity and strong mental focus. Assembling the Crossbow Claw consumed significant physical and mental energy and had to be completed in one go.

The Crossbow Claw wasn't just for herb gathering; it could also be used for scaling walls or traversing rooftops with remarkable effectiveness. However, its difficulty in both production and use made it impractical for military applications. Otherwise, during the Qingfu Temple's peak, combined with other tools and weapons and proper training, it could have formed the basis of an elite special operations unit.

The other piece of equipment was the Fireproof Robe or Fire-Washed Garment. In *Journey to the West*, Tang Sanzang's brocade cassock, impervious to fire and water, was similar to this type of magical attire. The Fire-Washed Garment was made from asbestos cloth, named for its ability to be cleaned by burning away stains. However, Zhou Qing knew that wearing asbestos cloth posed significant health risks, as its fibers could be inhaled, causing severe lung damage. The herb-gathering section also mentioned this drawback.

Despite this, asbestos cloth remained a valuable commodity due to its properties. *A New Account of the Tales of the World* recorded an anecdote about a Jin dynasty emperor who proudly wore a Fire-Washed Garment to a minister's house, only to find the servants dressed in the same material. While the story carried a mocking tone, it underscored the cloth's prestige.

In this world, asbestos cloth was similarly expensive. According to the *Spring Restoration Talisman Manual*, past temple masters had mostly crafted Fire-Washed Garments, relying on their lung cultivation to mitigate the health risks. Fushan, however, obtained the fur of a Firelight Beast from a patient and wove it into a Fire-Resistant Robe, which lacked the drawbacks of asbestos cloth. It also provided excellent defense against blades and projectiles (unless fired at extremely close range), was impervious to fire and water, and could even ward off miasma in the mountains.

"To the south lies a volcanic mountain, forty li in length, where trees burn endlessly day and night... Within the flames dwells a rodent, weighing a hundred jin, with fur over two chi long... Its fur is woven into cloth, which cleanses when burned. This creature is also called the Firelight Beast, and its fur is known as Fire-Resistant Cloth."

Zhou Qing recalled Fushan's description of the Firelight Beast, also known as the Fire Rat. Living in flames, it was exceedingly difficult to capture. Yet, due to its properties, it was highly sought after by the wealthy and powerful. Some martial artists, lured by high rewards, would risk wearing Fire-Washed Garments to hunt the creature. The Fire Rat fur Fushan obtained had been purchased by a patient from a martial artist and later used as payment for medical treatment.

Both the Crossbow Claw and the Fire-Resistant Robe had disappeared with Fushan, leaving Zhou Qing to fend for himself. Asking Butcher Hu to procure Fire Rat fur was unrealistic—this task would require Miss Lin's assistance. With the Lin family's business now stable and the search for six-leaf ginseng dependent on sheer luck, Zhou Qing decided to have Miss Lin temporarily shift her focus to gathering Fire Rat fur. He still had some Blood Qi Pills made from five-leaf ginseng, which should entice specialized hunters. After all, no matter how precious Fire Rat fur was, it couldn't compare to the tangible benefits of Blood Qi Pills for martial cultivation. Even someone like Xiao Ruowang, from a prestigious sect, valued them.

Zhou Qing approached Miss Lin about the matter and then returned to his own training.

By the time winter arrived, Zhou Qing had not only completed the Crossbow Claw but also advanced the Ape Form to the "Beginner" stage. The effort required was indescribable—this period was arguably the most grueling in his cultivation journey. Without medicinal aids, every step was arduous. Before practicing the Ape Form, he had to perform the Tiger, Deer, Bear, and Bird Forms along with their corresponding mantras, a complex sequence of movements and breathing rhythms that had to be executed flawlessly. Any mistake meant starting over.

He hadn't yet deeply experienced the so-called "Qi cultivation"; only the familiar heat from the Tiger Form manifested, nothing extraordinary. A qualitative change likely wouldn't occur until the Ape Form reached "Proficiency," and even "Skilled" might not suffice. Zhou Qing remained patient, confident he would get there eventually. The *Record of Nourishing Life* faithfully tracked his progress, and the "Literary Courage" within it aided his cultivation. He eagerly anticipated the day the Six-Word Mantra and Five Animal Frolics merged—then, the Palm Thunder technique could truly begin. For now, it remained a distant goal.

If his deductions were correct, the initial stage of Palm Thunder cultivation was related to Gang Jin (刚劲), but its ultimate effects would far surpass that. With this expectation, he pressed forward diligently in his Ape Form training.

One morning, the rooster "Morning Sun" brought back a dead snake after nearly two years—longer and thicker than the last, with a deep bluish hue. Zhou Qing had heard from the courier that many northern relay stations were nearly abandoned, with couriers stealing horses to flee for survival. Some yamen runners even suppressed protesting citizens by day, only to join the crowds at night, pressuring the officials inside. They, too, received no government rations. In past years, they could extort the people, but now the people had nothing left to give—only their lives.

"Hair like leeks, cut and regrown; heads like chickens, cut and still crowing. Officials need not be feared; the common folk are never to be underestimated."

Such songs spread across disaster-stricken regions. In comparison, while Xijiang and Tiannan provinces had banditry, they fared much better than the northern provinces. The courier enjoyed delivering letters to Scholar Zhou—not only was he well-paid, but Zhou was also courteous. Still, the courier found him peculiar: a provincial top scholar without a single servant. However, the Lin family periodically sent maids to clean, usually led by Miss Lin's personal maid, Chunxiang, accompanied by a few sturdy women. They always asked Zhou Qing's permission before entering to tidy up, keeping his residence neat.

The courier took his duties seriously. Within half a month, he returned with Xiao Ruowang's reply and official gazettes. As a provincial graduate, Zhou Qing was entitled to read them. The gazettes contained invaluable information for merchants, who would pay handsomely for advance knowledge of disasters to profit from them. After reviewing the gazettes, Zhou Qing passed them to Miss Lin. His residence was discreetly guarded by Lin family protectors to prevent unwanted attention, and they also handled message deliveries.

After skimming the gazettes, Zhou Qing handed them to the guards and pondered his reply to Xiao Ruowang. He snapped off a budding mulberry branch and wrote two lines:

"From Tiannan, I have nothing to send,  
So I offer you a branch of spring."

This was his response—complete with a gift. The mulberry tree was extraordinary; perhaps Xiao Ruowang could uncover something from it.

As the courier departed with the branch and letter, Zhou Qing reflected on Xiao Ruowang's words. The latter was clearly delighted to correspond, answering Zhou Qing's questions in detail. The Taihe Sect's cultivation emphasized "Clarity, Purity, and Stability," with breathing techniques akin to the Six-Word Mantra. Xiao Ruowang also addressed Fuso's doubts about the Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm. Having sparred with Fuso twice and being a renowned young martial artist, his insights into Blood Qi cultivation were uniquely valuable.

At the end of the letter, Xiao Ruowang mentioned that his master had given him a new sword named "Frost." Its heavy杀气 (killing intent) didn't suit his temperament, and his fellow disciples had grown wary of him since he started wielding it. Perhaps influenced by the sword's nature, he had become more stern and authoritative. Not knowing whom else to confide in, he shared these thoughts with Zhou Qing—another reason for the mulberry branch. The gesture carried his springtime blessings: with the warmth of spring, even frost would melt.

Zhou Qing sensed the intention behind Elder Zhang's decision. If Xiao Ruowang was to lead the Taihe Sect, he couldn't afford to be too amiable. Harmony was fine in peaceful times, but in chaos, it would harm both the sect and himself. Elder Zhang was growing old, and as the saying goes, "Parents who love their children plan for their future." Xiao Ruowang, being intelligent, likely understood this. His letter might have been half-complaint, half-pride.

"Walking, standing, sitting, lying down—all can be cultivation."

Xiao Ruowang's reply inspired Zhou Qing. His current efficiency was too low. The mantras for the Tiger and other forms could be integrated into daily activities, even during martial practice. "Practicing fists is also walking," Zhou Qing mused. Isolated training had its limitations; his cultivation philosophy needed continuous refinement. Priorities shifted with each stage.

He began experimenting. The Tiger-Crane Fist now felt even more potent as he incorporated the mantras of the Tiger and Crane Forms. His "Proficient" rating in the fist technique reflected his deep understanding, allowing him to enhance it further. This wasn't fusion but improvement—all martial arts evolved over time, just like medicinal formulas. What was difficult at first became easier later.

Initially, Zhou Qing estimated it would take another year to advance the Ape Form to "Skilled." Now, he believed six months might suffice. Faster progress was always welcome—the Ape Form was physically and mentally exhausting. Yet, he remained patient. The *Record of Nourishing Life* documented his journey, and the "Literary Courage" within bolstered his efforts. He looked forward to merging the Six-Word Mantra and Five Animal Frolics, when Palm Thunder could truly begin. For now, it remained a vision.

If his speculation was correct, the initial stage of Palm Thunder cultivation was tied to Gang Jin, but its eventual power would far exceed that. With this hope, he persevered in his Ape Form training.
