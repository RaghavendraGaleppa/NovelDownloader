# Chapter 187: At the Final Moment, an Old Friend Appears

The world was shrouded in mist, with endless roars echoing through the air. The thunderous sound of the tsunami became the only dominant melody. Lin Shan, Black Skeleton Demon Lord, and Luan Chun huddled together, jointly deploying defensive measures against the force of this natural disaster.

A vast expanse of white stretched before them, so dense they couldn't see their own hands in front of their faces. The sea and the flying boat had vanished from sight, and the battle between Protector Yan and the mermaid elder at the center of the battlefield was equally obscured. Only faint shouts could be heard amidst the roaring waves.

Three breaths later, an earth-shattering explosion erupted from directly ahead.

"Boom!"

The first to arrive was a violent shockwave, striking the trio at sonic speed without warning, leaving them no time to react.

"Bang!"

"Crack, crack—"

The three were sent flying dozens of meters by the shockwave. The high-grade magic artifact shield Black Skeleton Demon Lord had thrown out couldn't withstand the impact and shattered into countless fragments.

"A high-grade artifact crafted by a refining master—this is it?" Lin Shan looked at Black Skeleton Demon Lord with disbelief. Was his skill really this lacking? A mere aftershock of a spell couldn't even be blocked—was his title of refining master bought?

Black Skeleton Demon Lord was both embarrassed and angry. Did Lin Shan not realize what kind of aftershock this was? The residual force of a Golden Core cultivator's bloodline divine ability—could a single high-grade artifact really be expected to block it? Wasn't it already impressive enough?

But there was no time to explain. A towering tidal wave followed closely behind, its overwhelming pressure bearing down on them. In an instant, the white mist around them seemed to lose its color.

It turned out the tsunami had blotted out the sunlight, looming over them from above.

The terror of being swallowed whole was suffocating. The roaring tide surged like a thousand charging steeds, its thunderous rumbles carrying explosive roars.

Black Skeleton Demon Lord summoned one defensive artifact after another. Luan Chun pulled out stacks of defensive talismans. Lin Shan's body lit up with a sapphire-blue array.

Compared to the colossal wave, the three of them were like fireflies against the moon, vanishing into its depths in the blink of an eye. Only Protector Yan's faint reprimands could be heard ahead, as if she too had resorted to some last resort in this critical moment.

...

At some point, the world grew quiet again.

Clear skies stretched endlessly, the clouds and mist dispersed, and the boundless sea returned to its usual tranquility.

"Splash—"

Three figures emerged from beneath the water's surface, soaring back into the sky, breathing freely as if reborn from calamity.

"Master!"

Luan Chun was the first to spot a small boat floating on the sea. Yan Yuanchun sat at its bow, meditating to recover. Lin Shan and Black Skeleton Demon Lord quickly followed.

Returning to the flying boat, they found the once-proud artifact now battered and broken. Most of the hundred or so demonic cultivators aboard were injured—whether from their earlier battle with the mermaids or from the aftershocks of that divine ability, it was impossible to tell.

Yan Yuanchun's face was pale, her aura drastically weakened, teetering on the edge of falling from the Golden Core realm. It was unclear how she had managed to withstand the attack at the last moment or how she had saved everyone aboard.

The surviving demonic cultivators on the boat were all disheartened, their fighting spirit and confidence utterly shattered. They sighed in despair—they hadn't even encountered the righteous cultivators yet, and a single group of mermaids had already reduced them to this state. Only Old Man Zhong still had the presence of mind to check on Protector Yan's condition.

After a quarter-hour, Yan Yuanchun temporarily suppressed her injuries.

"The mermaid elder is no less injured than I am. He's already retreated with his people in the chaos. We can't stay here long either—if he returns to his tribe and calls for reinforcements, we'll be in real trouble if he comes back for us."

As she spoke, she paused, glancing at Luan Chun beside her. Sensing that the girl was unharmed, a trace of affection flickered in her eyes.

"We'll leave immediately and cross the Tempest Sea as quickly as possible."

No one objected—not that they could, given that they still relied on Protector Yan's Golden Core strength for protection. Of course, Lin Shan's earlier feat of single-handedly slaying four mermaid Foundation Establishment cultivators had also earned him deep respect and awe from the others.

Lin Shan himself felt nothing special about it. The mermaids were a weak race, no match for him at all. As for the mermaid girl taken away by their Golden Core elder, he had no intention of chasing after her.

The summoning contract had already been signed—she was family now. Where she was physically didn't matter.

At Lin Shan's request, Black Skeleton Demon Lord reluctantly took on the role of repairman, reforging the flying boat's artifact and re-engraving its formation arrays. The vehicle was practically remade, emerging anew.

Lin Shan's subordinates were unfazed by this, but Protector Yan, Luan Chun, and the others were astonished. They hadn't expected this skeletal monster to possess such high-level refining skills—repairing a high-grade artifact, and a valuable flying one at that, in such a short time. Could he be a refining master?

The skeletal monster let out a series of eerie chuckles, clearly reveling in the female cultivators' amazed gazes. Ever since following Lin Shan, it had never received such recognition. Now, it had finally made a grand display in front of others.

Yan Yuanchun didn't dwell on the matter, turning instead to pilot the flying boat as it carried everyone toward the horizon.

...

Two days later, a hurricane swept through the Tempest Sea.

The world was cast in gloomy darkness. Below, the waves churned violently, and torrential rain was whipped sideways by the gale-force winds. Yet the flying boat remained steady in the sky.

Everyone aboard gathered on the deck, gazing at the distant flickers of lightning. The storm seemed to herald an impending heavenly tribulation.

"In a few hundred more miles, we'll leave Great Song's waters and enter the territory of the Yan Kingdom."

"Then it'll be open seas for fish to leap, vast skies for birds to fly."

"Indeed. We won't have to live in fear anymore."

"But leaving our homeland like this... we may never return in this lifetime..."

...

As the murmurs spread behind them, Protector Yan and Lin Shan felt a heavy weight in their hearts. They knew the situation was far from so simple.

The Purple Mansion Sect's forces had already infiltrated the northern seas over ten days ago. The closer they got to the border, the higher the chance of encountering righteous alliance blockades.

After all, the mermaids had long since defected. With their intelligence network, tracking this boat's movements would be child's play. They would undoubtedly report it to the righteous cultivators for interception.

Meanwhile, the eastern sea's rear was likely already under righteous control. Their only option was to charge forward into Yan Kingdom's waters—even if it meant diving into the dragon's den, they had no choice but to press on.

As for the outer seas, they were the domain of foreign races and demonic beasts. For humans, venturing there meant an even more uncertain fate. Better to gamble on the path ahead.

Several hours later, the storm ahead began to thin. Everyone mentally calculated the distance—they knew they were about to break free of the eastern sea.

But a group was already waiting for them, blocking the path.

"Stop."

Yan Yuanchun raised her arm, and the flying boat slowly halted mid-air, standing firm like a reef amidst the tempest.

Her gaze pierced through the curtain of rain, landing on the figures several hundred meters ahead.

Below, the sea roared with waves. In the distance, thunder rumbled. Rain pelted against the boat's protective barrier in a relentless drumbeat.

A killing intent settled over everyone. They had known this moment would come—sooner or later. Any lingering hope was now utterly extinguished.

As expected, the righteous cultivators had sealed off their retreat, determined to trap them in the eastern sea. With the mermaids as allies providing intelligence, every move the demonic cultivators made in the Tempest Sea had been laid bare before their enemies.

"Fairy Yan, it's been years since we last met at the Purple Mansion Sect. Who would have thought our reunion would be under such circumstances?"

A middle-aged man's voice carried across from the opposing forces—steady, resonant, and calm. His words suggested he and Yan Yuanchun were old rivals who had crossed paths during the Purple Mansion Sect's war.

The eyesight of those on the boat wasn't sharp enough to make out details through the storm, but Lin Shan was an exception.

For him, seeing through ordinary illusion arrays was trivial, let alone distant scenery.

He could clearly see the five figures at the forefront—righteous Golden Core cultivators, judging by their status. Among them was an old acquaintance: Purple Mansion Sect's Thunder Rain Child.

And among the dozens of Foundation Establishment cultivators behind them, Thunder Shock Child, Thunder Cloud Child, and even Lin Fan stood out.

Some among them were deeply versed in the Dao, like Thunder Rain Child and Lin Fan, who could see Lin Shan from afar. Their eyes flickered with surprise and complex emotions when they spotted him.

They had no particular thoughts about Lin Shan joining the demonic faction—to each their own. But meeting under these circumstances meant things would likely end badly.

Lin Shan sighed at the whims of fate, encountering some of his few friends in the cultivation world on his escape. But the Purple Mansion Sect was responsible for attacking the northern seas, including intercepting the Black Lotus Sect's retreat. Given that these individuals were originally from the same sect, the odds of running into them weren't that low.

As for Thunder Rain Child advancing to Golden Core and Lin Fan breaking through to Foundation Establishment, he wasn't surprised in the slightest.

One was a nascent soul seed, the other a child of destiny—there was no way they'd remained stagnant all these years.

By now, Yan Yuanchun had stepped forward. Riding a beam of light, she advanced alone into the sky like a solitary warrior, facing hundreds of hostile gazes without fear. On her shoulders rested the hopes of all the demonic cultivators.

"Long time no see, fellow Daoists of the Purple Mansion Sect. Have you come to see us off before our departure?"

A middle-aged man stepped out from the righteous ranks, seemingly their leader. He faced Yan Yuanchun from afar, ignoring the two factions as he began reminiscing.

In his eyes, these demonic cultivators were already trapped—no retreat, no advance. From the moment of their defeat, their fates had been sealed, mere ripples in the tide of history.

Yan Yuanchun remained composed. Though her aura was weak—still unrecovered from her battle with the mermaid elder—she could only press forward now. She was the soul of this group, and she couldn't afford to fall.

The two conversed at length, never broaching the current conflict. Instead, they discussed their past encounters, their divine abilities and spells, their insights into cultivation—like old friends discussing the Dao.

Even the Purple Mansion Sect cultivators couldn't help but admire the demonic Golden Core protector's unwavering resolve and courage. Thunder Rain Child, who prided herself on being no less capable than any man, felt a flicker of mutual respect.

But all things must end. Eventually, their discussion concluded.

"Fairy Yan, it's never too late to mend your ways. If you're willing to turn back, I believe the righteous elders will grant you a chance."

"Spare your words, True One. This war is one of annihilation—mercy is not an option. I appreciate the sentiment, but let's proceed!"

Yan Yuanchun's figure grew hazy, dreamlike. She drew out her embroidered handkerchief artifact, clearly preparing to lead a desperate charge.

The middle-aged man sighed, shaking his head. Behind him, the four other Golden Core experts stepped forward, ready to join the fight. They would leave no room for error, ensuring none of these demonic cultivators escaped.

Everyone on the boat, Lin Shan included, tensed. They knew whether they could break through depended entirely on their own fortunes now.

Warriors would face warriors, generals would face generals. Whether Golden Core, Foundation Establishment, or Qi Condensation—everyone would fight against overwhelming odds, gambling their lives for a sliver of hope.

If they succeeded, the world would be theirs. If they failed, it would mean death and oblivion!

All eyes were fixed on that slender figure in the sky, attempting to face five alone. She carried the hopes of everyone aboard, standing firm despite the impossible odds.

With her Golden Core strength, she could have abandoned her followers long ago and fled alone—she might have even escaped alive.

But in this moment, she wasn't a seductive demoness. She was a heroine of indomitable will, bearing the weight of responsibility on her slender shoulders, upholding the dignity of the Black Lotus Sect as a major demonic faction.

The solemnity of it all stirred something in everyone's hearts—a burning fire in their chests, desperate to be unleashed.

In a daze, Lin Shan recalled their first meeting in Yi River, his awkwardness when calling her "Lady Yuanchun," the joke about redeeming a brothel madam, and the fury in her eyes when she'd received that letter...

Luan Chun watched her master's retreating back through tear-filled eyes, meeting the affectionate glance Yan Yuanchun cast her way. She bore witness to her master's resolve as she charged alone into the enemy ranks—like a meteor, fearless and unyielding.

A blinding light erupted in the sky as five bolts of lightning converged, illuminating every face below. The thunderclaps were deafening, then silence.

It might have been an eternity, or a single instant.

When sound returned, the wind still howled.

Everyone stood frozen in the rain's final act, staring blankly at the falling figure. In her hand was a tattered embroidered handkerchief, its pattern of mandarin ducks a symbol of a young girl's once-innocent dreams.

"Ah..."

An ancient sigh, weathered by time, echoed across heaven and earth—as if it had witnessed all the world's splendor and sorrow. A draconic aura suddenly descended!

The raging waves stilled. The howling winds ceased. The torrential rain dispersed. For thirty miles in every direction, earth-attribute spiritual energy surged violently. A golden vortex swirled in the sky, beautiful as a celestial ring of stars.

From the demonic flying boat, an unremarkable old man stepped forward.
