**Chapter 138: Disappointment (Bonus Chapter 2)**  

For major sects, hoarding Spirit-Ban Gold is a serious crime.  

The Heavenly Sea Sect offered generous merit points for the acquisition of Spirit-Ban Gold. Although it was mandatory, the compensation was equally substantial.  

After waiting for Yun Gang to finish speaking, Li Shiming glanced at him coldly and took out an object from his waist.  

"You're Yun Gang, aren't you? Just how much did the Holy Ice Sect bribe you to attempt murder in front of Enforcement Hall Elder Xu and within the Nine Peaks of our sect? If I weren’t a mid-level array master and hadn’t used the sect’s grand formation to protect myself, I’d already be dead by your hands!" Li Shiming angrily accused.  

The newly arrived Foundation Establishment cultivators had no prior knowledge of the incident. Only now, hearing Li Shiming’s explicit accusation, did they understand what had transpired.  

Their gazes turned scrutinizing as they looked between Li Shiming and Yun Gang. The truth now hinged on who was lying—such a grave crime, once confirmed, would not be tolerated by the sect, even for a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

"I was just momentarily enraged. You didn’t die, did you?" Yun Gang’s expression shifted as he spoke, startled by Li Shiming’s status as a mid-level array master and regretting his earlier impulsiveness.  

Li Shiming waited, expecting his backer to arrive.  

The sect’s grand formation rippled with spiritual energy as Uncle Zhuge materialized out of thin air.  

Though his combat strength wasn’t particularly high among the gathered Foundation Establishment cultivators, as a high-level array master, he didn’t rely on brute force. Within the sect’s grand formation, he could effortlessly trap and kill any Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

"Yun Gang, have you no shame? Attacking a Qi Refinement disciple? If you don’t give a proper explanation, my Dui Peak will have no end of grievances with your Gen Peak!" Uncle Zhuge’s voice was laced with fury as he glared at the space behind Yun Gang.  

Uncle Zhuge had received the news a step too late, having been occupied with sect affairs.  

Though he hadn’t heard the full story, the mere fact that Yun Gang had attempted to kill Li Shiming was enough to enrage him.  

Li Shiming was a mid-level array master who had already manifested the Starlight Sea of Arrays. As long as he lived, his ascension to high-level array master was inevitable.  

Moreover, both Li Shiming and Yin Shilan, now in possession of the Starlight Sea of Arrays at such a young age, were the sect’s brightest hopes for nurturing future array grandmasters.  

For years, the sect had failed to produce an array grandmaster. Now, with this glimmer of hope, it had almost been snuffed out within the sect itself.  

Uncle Zhuge’s words weren’t directed solely at Yun Gang. As the master of the sect’s grand formation, he had long detected the hidden presence of the Gen Peak’s master.  

Aside from the Central Peak, each of the Nine Peaks had its own master, forming the sect’s nine high-ranking elders who governed alongside the sect leader.  

The nine peak masters oversaw their respective peaks, wielding considerable authority and power within the sect.

"Junior Brother Zhuge, please calm down. If there is indeed evidence proving Yun Gang and the Yun Clan colluded with an external sect to murder a fellow disciple, the Enforcement Hall won’t need to intervene—my Gen Peak will purge them ourselves!" A figure appeared beside Yun Gang. It was Peak Master Zhao, who spoke in a measured tone.  

"Uncle Zhuge, I do have evidence!" Li Shiming interjected, stopping Uncle Zhuge from further debate with Peak Master Zhao.  

Instantly, all eyes in the room turned to Li Shiming, awaiting his next move.  

He opened the object in his hand, revealing a recorded scene on the screen—footage from the moment he entered the courtyard. Yun Ze’s words, even his arrogant demeanor at the time, were all clearly visible.  

Yun Ze, certain of Li Shiming’s impending death, had been unusually verbose.  

The four maidservants simultaneously drew their swords, their movements revealing their extraordinary skills to the Foundation Establishment cultivators present.  

"What is this? Even the 'Thousand-Mile Vision Mark II' doesn’t have this function!" Yun Gang exclaimed in shock.  

Though the 'Thousand-Mile Vision' was primarily circulated among Qi Refinement cultivators, after so much time, even some Foundation Establishment cultivators had acquired it out of curiosity. Thus, the device wasn’t unfamiliar to the gathered elders.  

Yun Gang, in particular, was well aware of it—the Yun Clan’s business had flourished thanks to the 'Thousand-Mile Vision,' providing him and another Foundation Establishment cultivator with additional spiritual stone resources.  

"The 'Thousand-Mile Vision' is a little gadget I created. What I’m holding is a prototype version!" Li Shiming replied with a faint smile.  

Fortunately, this particular device differed slightly from the standard model. Since it was for personal use, it relied minimally on spiritual energy and array runes.  

Thus, even when Yun Ze activated the Spirit-Ban Gold’s effect, Li Shiming’s device continued functioning normally—only its external communication features were disrupted, as those required interaction with array runes.  

Peak Master Zhao sighed inwardly. He had originally intended to shield Yun Gang and the Yun Clan, as they were part of Gen Peak, and their interests were closely tied to the peak’s own.  

But the evidence presented left him no choice but to abandon them.  

"Disgraceful! How dare you collude with an external sect to murder a fellow disciple within Gen Peak!" Peak Master Zhao’s eyes flashed with killing intent as a sword light materialized in his hand, slashing toward Yun Ze.  

As the primary culprit, Yun Ze’s death would allow all blame to be pinned on him, minimizing Gen Peak’s losses.  

The sword strike from a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator was unstoppable—even Enforcement Hall Elder Xu couldn’t intervene in time. The attack was too sudden, and Yun Ze seemed destined to die on the spot.  

---  

"Killing in front of me? It seems the rot runs deep in Gen Peak, from top to bottom!" Uncle Zhuge roared angrily.  

The devastating sword strike never landed. Though Peak Master Zhao ruled Gen Peak, ultimate control over the sect’s grand formation lay with Uncle Zhuge.  

The sword was blocked by the formation, leaving Yun Ze unharmed despite bracing for death.  

Li Shiming sighed inwardly at the complexity of Heavenly Sea Sect’s internal politics.  

Even with irrefutable evidence, a high-ranking elder like Peak Master Zhao still sided with the Yun Clan. The realization left him disheartened.  

Since joining the sect, though his cultivation resources had been limited, Li Shiming had always held the sect in high regard, considering himself a proud member of the Heavenly Sea Sect.  

But today’s events had significantly diminished his faith in the sect.  

"Elder Xu, this is Yun Ze’s storage bag, and this is my personal 'Thousand-Mile Vision,' containing evidence of the Yun Clan’s collusion with the Holy Ice Sect to murder fellow disciples. I trust the Heavenly Sea Sect will handle this matter justly," Li Shiming said, handing over the storage bag and device to Elder Xu.  

The gathered Foundation Establishment cultivators sensed the disappointment in Li Shiming’s tone—a sentiment born from his disillusionment with the sect.  

"Uncle Zhuge, thank you for your protection. I will now return to Eagle Beak Island and await the sect’s investigation," Li Shiming added, bowing deeply to Uncle Zhuge.  

Without another word or glance at the assembled elders, he summoned wings of spiritual energy and soared into the sky.  

"Peak Master Zhao, from now on, Gen Peak need not seek Dui Peak’s assistance for any array-related matters—except for the main formation," Uncle Zhuge declared coldly before vanishing into the air.  

Peak Master Zhao was taken aback by Uncle Zhuge’s stance. He had suppressed his anger earlier when Li Shiming displayed such audacity—since when could a mere mid-stage Qi Refinement disciple act so boldly in his presence?  

But Uncle Zhuge’s subsequent reaction made it clear just how highly Dui Peak valued Li Shiming.  

"Peak Master Zhao, shall you strike again and silence us all to bury this matter?" Elder Xu asked icily, gripping Yun Ze tightly, his eyes burning with fury.  

This trip to Gen Peak had been a series of affronts—first Yun Gang attempting murder in front of him, then Peak Master Zhao trying to kill Yun Ze. It was as if the Enforcement Hall meant nothing to them.  

Peak Master Zhao remained silent, realizing the gravity of his actions and their repercussions with Dui Peak and the Enforcement Hall.  

"Peak Master Zhao, Gen Peak is no place for us. I dare not linger, nor do I dare take Yun Gang into custody. Only a sect elder can handle this now. I will report everything truthfully to the sect leader," Elder Xu said cold
