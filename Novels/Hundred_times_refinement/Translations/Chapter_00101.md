# Chapter 51: Late Stage of the Agile Movement Realm

Everyone knew the key to resolving the situation lay in finding the Yan father and son. Whether it was the Drifting Clouds Valley, the Fire Spirit Sect, or their allies, all had dispatched countless disciples to search everywhere.

However, Lin Xuan had acted cleanly, leaving no traces behind. Despite their exhaustive efforts, the major sects found nothing.

After completing his pill refinement, Lin Xuan once stepped out for fresh air. From Zhao Ming, he learned of these developments. While he maintained a calm exterior, inwardly he was astonished.

He never expected the deaths of the Yan father and son to cause such an uproar. Of course, Lin Xuan felt no guilt or remorse.

First, the incident had begun when Yan Tianheng ambushed the Wang family to steal their cultivation techniques—it had nothing to do with him. Second, he had killed the Yan father and son only because they had tried to kill him first. Was he supposed to stand still and let them?

Lin Xuan wasn't that foolish. His philosophy was simple: if others didn't provoke him, he wouldn't provoke them. But if they did, he would show no mercy. Survival in the cultivation world required ruthlessness. While Lin Xuan wasn't bloodthirsty, he harbored no naive leniency toward his enemies.

No matter how chaotic the outside world became, it had little to do with him. If the sky fell, the taller ones would bear the brunt first. Let the elders and experts deal with the headaches. For now, his priority was to focus wholeheartedly on improving his strength.

He instructed Zhao Ming to prepare a large stock of dried rations and cured meat for him. Since Lin Xuan's cultivation level wasn't yet high enough to sustain himself without food, the disciples assumed the immortal master was simply preparing for another bout of lazy seclusion.

With everything ready, Lin Xuan threw himself into rigorous cultivation.

Each day, he consumed pills, meditated, and refined his qi...

Cultivation, at its core, involved absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, converting it into spiritual power, and storing it in the dantian. The techniques for the Agile Movement Realm were relatively simple—repeatedly performing the Grand Heavenly Cycle.

Though all techniques involved circulating spiritual energy through the eight extraordinary meridians, the pathways differed, leading to vastly different effects on cultivation.

For example, the technique Lin Xuan had practiced before was the most basic one given to ordinary disciples by his sect. Its efficiency in converting spiritual energy was mediocre, with no distinguishing features.

During his recent journey, however, he had acquired not only an intermediate-level technique but also the *Cloud Soaring Art*, the finest primary technique of the Cloud Soaring Sect. It was comparable to the *Flying Cloud Force*, a technique reserved for elite disciples in his own sect, each excelling in different aspects.

Holding the jade slip in his hand, Lin Xuan infused it with his spiritual sense. Moments later, he looked up with delight. The *Cloud Soaring Art* lived up to its reputation—the pathways for the Grand Heavenly Cycle were far more intricate and refined. Even without testing it, he could tell it was extraordinary.

Sitting down with a tranquil mind, Lin Xuan waited for the medicinal effects of the spirit pill to take hold before beginning the new Grand Heavenly Cycle as described in the *Cloud Soaring Art*.

...

Two hours later, Lin Xuan opened his eyes. His previous basic technique had required only a little over half an hour to complete one Grand Heavenly Cycle. Now, it took more than three times as long. But his meridians were better tempered, and the efficiency of spiritual energy conversion had greatly improved. The *Cloud Soaring Art* was indeed exceptional.

However, it wasn't without drawbacks. Compared to ordinary techniques, the *Cloud Soaring Art*'s Grand Heavenly Cycle was far more demanding. A single cycle consumed as much energy as five or six cycles of his previous technique.

An average person wouldn't have been able to endure it.

Lin Xuan finally understood why ordinary disciples were given basic techniques while elite disciples received superior ones. It wasn't that the sect was withholding knowledge—it was simply that better techniques required more arduous cycles, which those with poor aptitude couldn't handle.

Lin Xuan, however, was an exception. Though he lacked spiritual roots, his willpower was extraordinarily strong. He had endured the trials of the Heart-Tempering Path and routinely performed nine cycles where others only managed three. Thus, despite his poor aptitude, his perseverance allowed him to master advanced techniques.

This had nothing to do with pill assistance—it was purely the result of Lin Xuan's relentless effort.

...

Time passed day by day, and before long, over a month had gone by.

The waste pill repository remained as quiet as ever. The disciples idly basked in the sun, while the manager's door stayed firmly shut. They marveled at the immortal master's ability to sleep for so long.

This was all part of Lin Xuan's deliberate effort to avoid drawing attention. In truth, he was at a critical juncture—breaking through a bottleneck.

With the *Cloud Soaring Art* and the aid of numerous pills, Lin Xuan had progressed rapidly. He had reached the peak of the fourth layer and was now on the verge of stepping into the late stage of the Agile Movement Realm.

After consuming two mid-grade pills, Lin Xuan began his breakthrough attempt. Spiritual power circulated endlessly within his body, forming a sphere of energy in his dantian. The spiritual energy absorbed from the outside merged with the medicinal power of the Marrow-Cleansing Pill, continuously replenishing the sphere.

Originally pale blue, the energy sphere deepened in color under the pill's influence, then spun rapidly before dispersing back into strands of spiritual power.

The sphere shrank, while the spiritual energy in his meridians continued to replenish it. In this way, energy entered the sphere, was refined, and then dispersed anew.

This process, though seemingly simple, was incredibly difficult to execute. The slightest misstep could cause the energy sphere to rupture, leading to failure.

But if he could refine all the spiritual energy in his body, a transformation would occur, and he would successfully cross the threshold into the late stage of the Agile Movement Realm.

Beads of sweat formed on Lin Xuan's forehead. He proceeded with utmost caution, unwilling to let his efforts go to waste.

As time passed, his robes became drenched in sweat, yet he remained motionless, gritting his teeth and persisting.

...

Another hour later, Lin Xuan suddenly swayed and collapsed onto the floor. But this wasn't due to failure—it was sheer exhaustion from his successful breakthrough. He didn't even have the strength to sit upright.

"So close..." Though too exhausted to lift a finger, Lin Xuan smiled. He had finally mastered the fifth layer and entered the late stage of the Agile Movement Realm.
