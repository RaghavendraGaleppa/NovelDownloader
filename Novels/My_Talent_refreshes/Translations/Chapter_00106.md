## Chapter 106: Nurturing Spirit Pill

Gu Xiaoqing looked at Chu Ning with a hint of surprise.

Chu Ning explained, "Senior Sister Gu, I acquired quite a few pills from the storage bags of those Yin Mo Sect cultivators yesterday. I couldn't tell what they were, so I was hoping Senior Sister could help me identify them."

Hearing this, Gu Xiaoqing understood. "Let me see, but I don't know all types of pills either."

With that, Gu Xiaoqing picked up one of the bottles and poured out a pill. "This is an ordinary Recovery Pill."

Chu Ning nodded. He had poured some out and looked at them yesterday, thinking they looked similar. However, many pills shared similar shapes and colors, so he wasn't entirely certain.

"This is a Calming Heart Pill. Some cultivators practice special cultivation methods, and rushing or improperly cultivating can sometimes lead to emotional instability, or even severe backlash. This Calming Heart Pill is used for regulation."

"This is a Qi Gathering Pill, similar in effect to a Essence Gathering Pill..."

Gu Xiaoqing picked up bottle after bottle, identifying and explaining the pills to Chu Ning. Then, she took out paper slips and labeled each bottle. Most of the pills were identified, but two were set aside by Gu Xiaoqing.

Finally, Gu Xiaoqing picked up the two remaining bottles. "One of these I don't recognize at all. The blood fiend aura is so strong; it's very likely a pill specifically used for cultivating certain evil path techniques."

Gu Xiaoqing set one bottle down and picked up the last one, hesitating for a moment before saying, "This pill is very similar to a Spirit Nurturing Pill that I saw my master possess once, but I haven't had much contact with it, so I'm not entirely sure."

Hearing Gu Xiaoqing's words, Chu Ning's eyes flickered. The two pills in this bottle were ones he had specifically separated out. They were precisely the Spirit Nurturing Pills he had obtained from Qi Chongmao earlier. Chu Ning had never found a suitable opportunity to have them identified, but this time, with so many pills, he simply took a few out.

Now, hearing Gu Xiaoqing identify them as Spirit Nurturing Pills, Chu Ning quickly asked, "Senior Sister Gu, what is this Spirit Nurturing Pill used for? It sounds like it's related to spiritual sense."

Gu Xiaoqing nodded. "Indeed. The Spirit Nurturing Pill is said to be a common pill for Foundation Establishment cultivators. It's somewhat similar to our Qi Condensation stage's Recovery Pill, primarily used to restore depleted spiritual sense. I've also heard it has some effect on damaged spiritual sense."

Chu Ning nodded slightly upon hearing this. This was generally consistent with what he had previously thought, and now it was finally confirmed. After some thought, Chu Ning, still a little unsure, turned to Gu Xiaoqing and said, "I think I remember this bottle actually had a Spirit Nurturing Pill label on it yesterday. Senior Sister Gu, are these pills alright?"

Gu Xiaoqing poured out a pill, examined it for a while, and then sniffed it carefully before putting it back into the bottle. "If that's the case, then this is undoubtedly a Spirit Nurturing Pill. The pill itself is fine."

Seeing this, Chu Ning finally relaxed. He picked up the bottle containing the two Spirit Nurturing Pills, the bottle of Qi Gathering Pills, and also the other bottle that Gu Xiaoqing didn't recognize, which supposedly contained a large amount of blood fiend aura.

Chu Ning then said to Gu Xiaoqing, "Senior Sister Gu, I don't have any immediate use for these other pills. How about I leave them with you to see if you can sell them for me, or if you return to the sect, could you help me turn them in for recycling?"

"Alright, leave these pills to me. I'll let you know how much spirit stones they fetch later." Gu Xiaoqing readily agreed.

Chu Ning chatted with her for a few more moments before returning to his own shop. Making talismans, cultivating—Chu Ning spent the entire day in his courtyard. He dared not go to the spirit fields for now, preferring to wait until the sect completed a larger-scale clean-up. Fortunately, both types of spirit plants had already been harvested, so there was nothing special to do at the spirit fields.

Mercifully, the market seemed largely unaffected. The Yin Mo Sect had not targeted rogue cultivators or cultivation families, so these individuals hadn't experienced much. Moreover, as everyone had previously sensed, due to the increase in intermediate and advanced first-tier demonic beasts within the mountain range, more rogue cultivators and cultivation family members had indeed been entering the mountains to hunt demonic beasts recently. Thus, the talismans sold quite well the next day.

As the market was about to close that afternoon, Chu Ning and the others received a sound transmission talisman from Lin Changqing. After reporting their skirmish with the Yin Mo Sect disciples to the sect two days prior, the sect recognized Chu Ning and the others' contributions. Therefore, they agreed to Lin Changqing's suggestion to provide some compensation for their losses. They were asked to prepare to return to the sect in half an hour.

Receiving this news, Chu Ning was undoubtedly overjoyed.

Back in his courtyard, Chu Ning began packing his things. He had planted many spirit plants he had acquired earlier in his Green Stream Spirit Plant Shop courtyard, and he decided to take them all back to the sect this time. He could take them to the Spirit Plant Hall to offset some of his monthly rent. Of course, all the items he had obtained from the Yin Mo Sect cultivators were also taken along. In addition, Chu Ning hadn't drawn any high-grade low-tier talismans these past few days, but he had focused on drawing many intermediate-grade low-tier talismans. These talismans were naturally also prepared to be turned in to the sect for recycling, to see if he could exchange them for anything.

Half an hour later, Lin Changqing arrived at the market on time and picked them up. After several months away from the Green Stream Sect, the group finally stepped back through the mountain gate.

"You all can go to your respective halls first. Tomorrow morning, go to the Hundred Treasures Pavilion to claim your rewards. Your losses and contributions have already been reported to the sect." With that, Lin Changqing hastily departed.

"Finally, we're back! It's good to be in the sect," Shen Zhengquan exclaimed first after Lin Changqing left. The others also showed similar expressions. Only Chu Ning, at this moment, felt a touch of melancholy. He still didn't have a place to stay tonight. It was previously said that a courtyard would be arranged for him in the outer sect, but before it could be arranged, he was directly assigned to Yanji Market. And his courtyard in District D, which he had vacated, should have already been assigned to someone else.

After some thought, Chu Ning decided to first look for He Changyou. If he couldn't find him, he would look for Liao Yunming. It was a good opportunity to find these two stewards now that he was back.

The group bid farewell in the outer sect. While it was still early, Chu Ning quickly headed towards the Spirit Plant Hall's training ground. He searched the training ground but He Changyou was nowhere to be found. He asked a senior brother from the Spirit Plant Hall, but even he didn't know where the steward had gone. As a steward, He Changyou resided in the inner sect area. Chu Ning was not qualified to go there, so he naturally couldn't find his residence.

In his helplessness, Chu Ning went directly to the Spirit Talisman Pavilion. To his surprise, Liao Yunming wasn't there either. Even Senior Brother Tan Zhang, whom Chu Ning was familiar with, was not in the Spirit Talisman Pavilion. Only another senior brother, whom Chu Ning was not very acquainted with, was present, so Chu Ning couldn't directly ask him for their residences. Zhuang Yunde was out of the question, and Mu Ling's place was not appropriate. Chu Ning thought for a moment, then simply turned and headed towards District D of the Spirit Plant Hall. It had been a while since he saw Qiu Shunyi; he might as well stay at his place for the night.

Just as Chu Ning was heading to Qiu Shunyi's residence, in the inner sect, in a courtyard filled with various spirit plants of clearly high grades, Liao Yunming and He Changyou sat opposite each other, drinking spirit tea.

"Old He, why do you grow so many flowers and plants? You should get more of this spirit tea instead. Then I could come here every day to nourish my heart."

He Changyou glanced at Liao Yunming, scolding with a laugh, "I finally understand how that kid learned to ask everyone for benefits. He must have learned it from you. Back in the Spirit Plant Hall, he was an honest fellow."

Liao Yunming pouted after hearing this. "He was an honest fellow, but he was truly eager for benefits. He came to us asking for benefits even before going to Yanji Market last time. I heard his losses were significant this time, so he'll definitely come crying to us both."

He Changyou nodded. "No doubt he will. If the sect wasn't compensating and rewarding, then fine, we should take care of our own disciples. But the sect is compensating and rewarding, and he still expects us to pay out of our own pockets? That's going too far."

Liao Yunming nodded heavily, agreeing heartily. "Exactly. Once the sect finishes its rewards, if he comes to us again, we'll have a good excuse to refuse. Speaking of which, I regret being too generous with him at first; it's made his appetite grow..."

...

Chu Ning was naturally unaware of what was happening in the inner sect. How could he know that these two steward lords were deliberately avoiding him? At this moment, Chu Ning arrived at Qiu Shunyi's residence in Spirit Plant District D. He called out, but Qiu Shunyi was not there.

"Is this kid so diligent that he's still in the spirit fields this late?" Thinking this, Chu Ning walked towards his spirit field. It was the Red Spirit Rice harvesting season, and as Chu Ning walked, he saw from a distance that Qiu Shunyi was standing in front of a pile of harvested Red Spirit Rice stalks, with his back to Chu Ning. Opposite him was an older menial disciple. The two seemed to be arguing.

Chu Ning quickened his pace. His spiritual sense was keen, and even without deliberately extending it, he overheard their conversation as he approached. He first heard Qiu Shunyi's angry voice. "Senior Brother Chen, this spirit field is clearly mine, and I planted this Red Spirit Rice. Why should I give you a share?"

"Although this spirit field is yours, I made a mistake while casting spells every day in this area, which is why your Red Spirit Rice grew so well. Since I helped boost your Red Spirit Rice yield, isn't it only right for you to share some with me?" The man spoke slowly, but his tone carried an undeniable quality.

"You're full of nonsense!" Qiu Shunyi must have been arguing with him for a long time, as he finally couldn't help but roar. "How many times have I told you, these Red Spirit Rice grew so well because I used the Evergreen Talismans my friend gave me."

The menial disciple surnamed Chen scoffed. "You, a menial disciple? Where would you get a friend who gives you Evergreen Talismans? And ones that can cover such a large area..."

Chu Ning had moved from District D to District C, then immediately became an outer sect disciple at the Spirit Talisman Pavilion. Some people in District C knew about this, but those in District D who weren't particularly attentive were truly unaware. In fact, if Chu Ning hadn't actively told Qiu Shunyi before leaving, he wouldn't have known either.

Chu Ning now generally understood what was happening. The two men's spirit fields bordered each other, and before Chu Ning left, he had given Qiu Shunyi some Evergreen Talismans. Qiu Shunyi must have used them to improve the quality of a section of his Red Spirit Rice field, resulting in better yield and quality. The menial disciple surnamed Chen was using this as an excuse, claiming he had made a mistake in casting spells.

As Chu Ning frowned slightly, he also couldn't help but secretly shake his head. "This is truly the downside of the low-grade spirit fields in District D. They're just separated by a ridge, without individual isolation via restrictive spells."

At this moment, the confrontation between the two continued. The older menial disciple surnamed Chen, standing opposite Qiu Shunyi, spoke with displeasure, coldly shouting, "And you, kid, watch your mouth, or I'll make you regret it." This man was not young and had already reached the fourth level of Qi Condensation, two realms higher than Qiu Shunyi. Qiu Shunyi was threatened by this man and dared not speak directly for a moment, though his face remained full of anger. The menial disciple surnamed Chen then directly used the Object Manipulation Art to move the Red Spirit Rice behind Qiu Shunyi towards his own side.

Seeing this, Chu Ning pointed casually, also sending out a stream of Object Manipulation Art. The Red Spirit Rice, which had just begun to move, returned to its original position. At the same time, Chu Ning appeared in the field.

"Chu Ning?"

At this, Qiu Shunyi also saw Chu Ning and let out a surprised cry. The disciple surnamed Chen first froze, then, upon seeing Chu Ning, his expression immediately changed. "An outer sect disciple?"

Although the Green Stream Sect's robes were all green, the outer sect disciples' robes were distinctly different in style from those of menial disciples. Thus, the disciple surnamed Chen could recognize him at a glance.

Chu Ning heard their voices, first nodding to Qiu Shunyi, then his gaze shifted to the disciple surnamed Chen. "The talismans Shunyi used were given by me. You wouldn't think I'm incapable, would you?"

Hearing Chu Ning's words, the disciple surnamed Chen's face instantly showed an awkward expression. He quickly clasped his hands and bowed, saying, "Greetings, Outer Sect Senior Brother. This was just a misunderstanding. If Junior Brother Qiu had mentioned he knew Senior Brother earlier, I..."

"Whoosh!"

He had only just spoken when a green light flashed past. Immediately, the disciple surnamed Chen saw a wisp of his hair float down. This scene instantly made cold sweat break out on the disciple's forehead. Although he thought Chu Ning's cultivation didn't seem much higher than his own, this single move made him realize clearly that the two of them were not on the same level at all.

"This is a warning. If there's a next time..."

"No! No! There definitely won't be a next time!" The disciple surnamed Chen immediately responded.

Chu Ning ignored him and said to Qiu Shunyi, "Shunyi, take your things and let's go."

"Alright!" Qiu Shunyi immediately beamed with joy, eager to pick up all the Red Spirit Rice. Chu Ning, however, took out a storage bag at this moment and casually put all the Red Spirit Rice inside, then stepped out of the spirit field. Qiu Shunyi followed along, smiling broadly.

"This person actually knows an outer sect disciple." The disciple surnamed Chen let out a long breath as he watched the two leave, his expression becoming incredibly complex.

"Chu Ning, when did you get back?"

"Haha, that was so satisfying! Did you see the expression on that guy Chen's face? I finally got rid of some pent-up anger!"

"... "

As soon as they started walking, Qiu Shunyi chattered incessantly. Chu Ning casually gave a reason, saying the sect requested his return to report on the market situation, without mentioning the Yin Mo Sect attack or similar matters. Such things were too distant for Qiu Shunyi; even if he knew, it wouldn't mean anything.

From Qiu Shunyi's words, Chu Ning learned that this disciple surnamed Chen had previously often pressured Qiu Shunyi, relying on his earlier entry into the sect and higher cultivation. So, Qiu Shunyi felt immensely relieved and pleased that Chu Ning had acted to scare the other party.

Chu Ning simply smiled after hearing it. A Qi Condensation fourth-level menial disciple in District D was actually among the lowest-status individuals in the sect. But the lower their status, the more likely such individuals were to develop twisted mentalities. Cao Dongxin, from before, was an example. Such people, when they were nasty, could indeed make others uncomfortable. This Chen disciple had been stuck here for so many years, indicating a lack of talent and resources, so Chu Ning just casually gave him a warning.

The two returned to Qiu Shunyi's courtyard. When Qiu Shunyi heard Chu Ning say he would sleep in his courtyard tonight, he immediately busied himself, setting things up. He cooked spirit rice and prepared three or four dishes. Chu Ning didn't stop him. After dinner, as they sat down, he handed a storage bag to Qiu Shunyi.

Qiu Shunyi愣ed, a little confused.

"Shunyi, because I was at the market for this period, the sect gave me a storage bag. I have a few storage bags on me now, so I'll give this one to you. Your Red Spirit Rice is in this storage bag, and I've also put some pills and talismans inside..." Chu Ning looked at Qiu Shunyi's slightly flushed face and gently patted him. "In this cultivation world, if you don't want to be bullied, strength is king. I was lucky; I happened to earn some spirit stones through making talismans, and these things are of no use to me for now. If you feel uncomfortable, just consider it a loan from me. Improve your cultivation and cultivate higher-grade spirit fields, obtain more resources. If you take this step, you might be several steps faster than others."

Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, Qiu Shunyi nodded heavily. Then he reached out and tightly grasped the storage bag in his hand, looking gratefully at Chu Ning. "Chu Ning, you're right. I'll consider these a loan from you, and I'll definitely repay you in the future."

Chu Ning smiled when he heard this. He didn't expect Qiu Shunyi to actually repay him. To put it bluntly, these things were not very useful to Chu Ning himself. He had a whole pile of storage bags, and a bit of Evergreen Talismans were just a few casual strokes of the brush. As for the pills, it was the bottle of Qi Gathering Pills he had left behind; Chu Ning had already tried them yesterday. These pills had similar effects to Essence Gathering Pills and weren't very useful to him. However, for Qiu Shunyi, these things might truly be resources that could change his destiny.

Qiu Shunyi had treated him well before, and Chu Ning somewhat acknowledged this kindness. But that was truly all it was; beyond that, he couldn't help the other party much at the moment. The path of cultivation, in the end, still depended on oneself.

That night, Chu Ning rested in Qiu Shunyi's courtyard. The next morning, Chu Ning went directly to the Outer Sect's Hundred Treasures Pavilion.
