# Chapter 75: Chief Appraiser

The three of them chatted until nightfall, only parting ways reluctantly when the street vendors had already packed up. 

The two stall owners believed Lin Shan must come from an extraordinary background—even if he wasn't a disciple of one of the Great Song Cultivation World's three top sects, his sect or faction was likely quite influential. Thus, they were willing to befriend him. 

Before leaving, they exchanged communication talismans and mailing addresses. 

Lin Shan chose the public mailbox of Yichuan Market as his mailing address. Any letters sent to him would be automatically delivered to his cave residence by the market staff as long as he lived in Yichuan. 

The other two left addresses from the Murong and Tantai families—both renowned cultivation clans. 

As for today's main task of setting up a stall, it could only be considered a partial success. 

Two wandering cultivators had shown interest in Lin Shan's goods during the day, purchasing the artifact refinement set and beast taming set for 25 and 30 spirit stones respectively. Lin Shan didn't haggle too much, as he didn't have endless time to spend on stall-keeping. 

His goal was simply to gather 100 spirit stones to purchase the Qi Refining Early Stage Barrier-Breaking Pill. 

Taking advantage of the early evening before shops closed, Lin Shan went to the commercial district and acquired the low-grade pill, leaving him penniless once again. 

"If I don't earn any spirit stones in the next few days, I'll probably be evicted from Yichuan by the enforcers once my cave residence lease expires," Lin Shan mused as he returned to his dwelling. 

Eagerly, he took out the Qi Refining Early Stage Barrier-Breaking Pill. 

Tonight, he would reach late-stage Qi Refinement. 

"Enhance!" 

The pill in his hand shimmered with flowing light as its properties transformed. 

**[Condensed Spirit Pill]**
Quality: Jade Pill  
Description: Refined with Jade-Gathering Grass as the main ingredient and twelve supplementary herbs. Assists in breaking through mid-stage Qi Refinement bottlenecks.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

...

"Mortals' pills, innate pills, Qi Refining jade pills, Foundation Establishment treasure pills, Golden Core law pills... The enhancement panel's classifications perfectly align with the cultivation world's tiers," Lin Shan observed before swallowing the pill without further delay, commencing his breakthrough. 

...

The next morning, a refreshed Lin Shan strolled through the streets, humming a tune as he enjoyed the cool dawn breeze. 

Now at late-stage Qi Refinement, he had essentially achieved all his goals in Yichuan. Even if he were forced to leave now, it wouldn't matter much. 

After returning to the capital Bianliang to harvest another wave of ancient charm, he could venture to the fringes of wild mountain ranges to hunt demonic beasts and gather rare herbs—always a reliable way to earn spirit stones. With enough savings, he could always return. 

After all, this world was vast beyond measure. The Great Song Dynasty alone contained two major wild mountain ranges—the Central Luosong Mountains and the Northern Yanyun Mountains. 

Now that he'd reached late-stage Qi Refinement, he could tentatively explore these areas. As for traveling north through the Yanyun Mountains to the Great Yan Dynasty—Lin Shan wasn't yet considering international travel. 

However, as he walked past a street corner plaza, his gaze suddenly fell upon a large building adorned with six gilded characters: 

"Auction Consignment Office" 

Beside it was a countdown: 2 days. 

Lin Shan instantly recalled yesterday's conversation with the two cultivation clan stall owners. Now that his cultivation met the minimum requirements and he happened to have a suitable item in his storage pouch... 

His eyes gleamed as he quickened his pace toward the building. 

...

Entering the auction consignment office, he found only one elderly appraiser reclining on a rattan chair behind the counter, engrossed in an ancient text. It was still early morning, and most major clients had already submitted their consignments in advance. At this hour, only wandering cultivators of questionable means arrived—many of whose treasures wouldn't even qualify for auction. 

Approaching the counter, Lin Shan cautiously stated he had a treasure for consignment and produced the Purple Spirit Fruit seed, though he wasn't entirely confident about its value. 

To his surprise, the elderly appraiser glanced at it and let out a soft "Hmm," though without much astonishment. 

Slowly straightening up, the appraiser produced a tweezer-like detection artifact from somewhere and began examining the seed. 

Lin Shan pondered internally—with his enhancement panel, he could probably work as an appraiser himself! 

After all, his panel could identify everything from hidden split souls to immortal realm Buddhas and even the legendary Nailhead Seven Arrow Book immortal technique. 

Wouldn't that make him the ultimate appraiser in the cultivation world? 

This idea, which had occurred to him before coming to Yichuan, now resurfaced with greater appeal. The more he thought about it, the more he realized this could be a lucrative career path! 

Of course, he'd need some detection artifact as cover—otherwise, he might raise suspicions. 

While Lin Shan's mind wandered, the auction house appraiser proved thoroughly professional, delivering a precise verdict within half a quarter-hour: 

"A mutated seed from a two-hundred-year-old Water Spirit Fruit!" 

Lin Shan inwardly marveled at the man's expertise and promptly praised, "Your discerning eye is unmatched, senior. It is indeed a Purple Spirit Fruit seed." 

The appraiser put away his detection artifact and subtly probed for the seed's origins—standard auction house procedure. Items with clean backgrounds could be auctioned freely, while those obtained through murder and theft depended on whether the seller's backing was strong enough. 

If the auction house could handle the potential fallout, they might proceed. Otherwise, they'd direct the seller to the black market—businessmen naturally avoided unnecessary risks. 

Lin Shan lied effortlessly: "My ancestors were part of a cultivation clan that specialized in cultivating Water Spirit Fruit plants. One mutated into a Purple Spirit Fruit, and this seed has been passed down through generations." 

The appraiser nodded. "This seed still retains excellent vitality, as if it recently bore fruit—no more than half a year since maturity. Your family's preservation methods must have been exceptional to maintain its vitality so well." 

Lin Shan broke into a cold sweat. From Dongting Lake to Yichuan, it had indeed been less than half a year since he consumed the Purple Spirit Fruit, making the seed a recent leftover. He'd nearly been caught in his lie—this old man was terrifyingly sharp! 

Hastily agreeing, Lin Shan showered the appraiser with flattery, hoping to secure a higher base price. 

After some contemplation, the appraiser declared, "Water-attribute mutated Vermilion Fruits aren't particularly rare, but obtaining a mutated seed does hold some value. For sects and clans, it represents a long-term cultivation asset. Let's set the base price at 700 spirit stones." 

Overjoyed, Lin Shan bowed repeatedly in gratitude. 

This senior appraiser was clearly a venerable figure, likely at Foundation Establishment realm or above, and couldn't be bothered to swindle juniors like Lin Shan. 

After completing the registration, the appraiser handed Lin Shan an auction house token, which would grant him entry in two days and serve as proof of consignment. 

With formalities concluded, Lin Shan seized the opportunity to inquire about appraiser salaries, benefits, cave residence subsidies, and even unemployment insurance in Yichuan Market. 

Gradually discerning the young man's intentions, the appraiser asked, "You want to become an appraiser?" 

Lin Shan: "Mhmm~" 

"Have you received any professional training?" 

Lin Shan: "Absolutely! My ancestral cultivation clan produced appraisers for generations!" 

"Show me your detection artifact." 

Lin Shan: "Uh... I forgot to bring it. But I can make blind appraisals without one!" 

... 

Moments later, the appraiser placed several brocade boxes on the counter. "These are items that failed to sell in previous auctions. Consider them practice material." 

Lin Shan examined each one, pretending to carefully inspect them. 

"Five-hundred-year-old Earth Tongue Orchid, high-grade magic tool Flowing Cloud Banner, fire-attribute treasure fragment, and this appears to be a feather shed by a Foundation Establishment-stage demonic beast." 

He deliberately misidentified one item while accurately describing the others' origins and functions. 

This alone astonished the elderly appraiser, who slapped his thigh in amazement. 

"Remarkable! To appraise with such precision without a detection artifact—you're truly a rare talent!" 

Lin Shan beamed. "Can I start tomorrow?" 

"Unfortunately, all appraiser positions are currently filled. There's no vacancy." 

Lin Shan clasped his hands. "That's fine! I can work as an apprentice or assistant—just provide room and board!" 

"No, what I mean is—in five days, I'll be transferred from Yichuan to Yinchuan Market." 

The appraiser smiled warmly. "And you—will succeed me as Yichuan Auction House's Chief Appraiser!" 

"?!!!"
