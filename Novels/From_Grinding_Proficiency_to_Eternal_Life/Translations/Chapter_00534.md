# Chapter 534: Cultivation Knows No Seasons

Every day, without fail, Xu Yunfan would circulate the *Divine霄 Nine Firmament True Void Indestructible Scripture* one hundred and eight great cycles, accumulating that meager proficiency.

He couldn't overdo his cultivation.

If he were to push the Great Cycle of the scripture to perfection and his physical body to its limit, continuing to cultivate would cause his spiritual power to overflow, and further cultivation would instead lead to regression.

This is where a cultivator's talent, aptitude, and comprehension truly show.

Some people, after completing a full cycle, might advance their cultivation by ten points in a day, while others might only advance by one.

Over a long period, the difference naturally becomes immense.

Xu Yunfan, with his Attribute Panel and the vast wealth of Chu Chengnan, could only achieve such speed by consuming pills as if they were food and water.

Besides this, he also invested a great deal of energy into other fields.

The Dao of Formations was a foundation he had always valued.

Whether it was protecting his cave dwelling, deploying formations to kill enemies, or arranging the space after opening a grotto-heaven in the future to gather Qi and condense essence, profound knowledge of formations would always provide a significant advantage.

Thanks to the assistance of the Attribute Panel and Zhang Ziyang, who resided within the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, Xu Yunfan's progress in studying the Dao of Formations was extraordinary.

He would take out the many jade slips of formation texts he had collected over the past and immerse his mind in them. Whenever he encountered a difficult-to-understand node in a formation principle or was hindered in deducing the connection of runes, he would use his spiritual sense to communicate with the soul inside the banner.

Although Zhang Ziyang was restricted within the banner due to having no physical body, his talent and comprehension were so shocking that Xu Yunfan was left speechless. He could grasp the key points after just a casual glance, often able to infer the rest from a single example and get straight to the heart of the matter.

"Why can't you remember this? Kan Li Dui Water, condense the Water Element..."

When facing a slightly more complex Profound Water Control Formation, Zhang Ziyang spoke with some helplessness.

Xu Yunfan, his face filled with a trace of shame, could only thicken his face and continue to accept Zhang Ziyang's one-on-one instruction.

Heaven have mercy, he was the one who started studying the Profound Water Control Formation first.

But Zhang Ziyang, after looking at it for only half a day, had already dissected its true meaning.

His comprehension was inhuman.

Under Zhang Ziyang's guidance, Xu Yunfan grasped the core essence of his words, made it his own, and constantly cross-referenced it with the classics.

'You have successfully comprehended the Dao of Formations, your Formulation Primer proficiency has increased by +1'

Glancing at the information prompt that floated into his vision, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but let out a breath.

Fortunately, as long as his proficiency increases, his understanding of formations will also deepen, so he doesn't have to feel like an idiot.

Xu Yunfan used the Attribute Panel to visualize the deduction process, rapidly absorbing the insights into the Dao of Formations that Zhang Ziyang revealed, in a space between reality and illusion.

Formation runes flowed like a star river in his heart, and their structural deductions were repeatedly deconstructed and reassembled in his sea of consciousness.

This kind of cultivation, which required intense mental focus for precise calculations and mystical comprehension, was completely different from the bitter cultivation of the *Divine霄 True Scripture*, which focused on drawing in Qi and tempering the body. It completely filled the gaps in his thinking between cultivation sessions, making every day feel full.

It was so full that Xu Yunfan almost wanted to escape.

Of course, what made him feel even more at ease was the cultivation of the Sword Dao.

Relying on the peerless talent and comprehension of his clone, Han Shi, and combining it with his own Attribute Panel, it would be a waste not to practice the *Myriad Chariots Sword Manual* from the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect.

This sword manual was not merely a true method for sword cultivators; it was more like a foundation for building a towering skyscraper from the ground up. It expounded on the origin of the Great Dao of the Sword, pointing directly to the realm of turning the intangible into the tangible and uniting all swords as one.

As long as the *Myriad Chariots Sword Manual* was perfected, any advanced sword manuals practiced afterward would yield twice the result with half the effort.

On the back mountain of Divine霄 Peak, amidst the steep cliffs rarely visited by humans, Xu Yunfan cleared out a hidden platform.

When the first light of dawn appeared, he would be there practicing his swordplay.

At first, Xu Yunfan silently linked to his clone Han Shi's vision. He held an ordinary iron sword in his hand and, following the patterns of the *Myriad Chariots Sword Manual*, meticulously practiced the basic sword stances.

Thrust, slash, flick, sweep, hook, poke...

The movements were slow and clear. With every sword strike, he用心 (用心) experienced the transmission of force and the flowing trajectory of intent within the blade.

Gradually, the ordinary iron sword was replaced by a low-grade magical sword. Sword Qi began to emanate from his body, forming a sharp edge without the need for spiritual power to be channeled into it.

If he slowly injected the faint thunder power drawn by the *Divine霄 True Scripture* into the sword's body, every swing would cause a "crackling" sound in the air, with golden electric snakes flickering within the sword light.

The thunder of Divine霄 inherently contained a majestic, heavenly might, combining solemn killing intent with speed.

And the Sword Dao represents the ultimate sharpness and change.

The concept of the *Myriad Chariots Sword Manual* in controlling ten thousand swords and embracing all changes resonated wonderfully with the connotation of the birth and destruction of thunder in the *Divine霄 True Scripture*.

Relying on the sword Dao talent of his clone, Han Shi, the *Myriad Chariots Sword Manual* was rapidly pushed towards perfection.

And at the moment when thunder light and sword Qi fused and connected, he could feel his understanding of the destruction and rebirth of thunder deepen by a fraction. As a result, the proficiency panel for the *Myriad Chariots Sword Manual* increased far more rapidly than that of the *Divine霄 True Scripture*.

Day after day, year after year.

Clouds gathered and dispersed atop Divine霄 Peak, how many cycles of cold and heat, spring and autumn, had passed, no one knew.

Many things might have happened in the world outside the cave dwelling, but for Xu Yunfan, who sat in seclusion on the peak,一心 (一心) focusing on his cultivation, time seemed to be both stretched and compressed.

Those fellow disciples, Foundation Establishment True Persons who had once tried to build connections and inquire for news, after being turned away many times, gradually became tactful and stopped visiting.

The reputation of "Xu Yunfan is in seclusion, cultivating hard, and does not concern himself with external affairs" on Divine霄 Peak quietly spread among the outer disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Xu Yunfan naturally got his wish and became a "reclusive cultivator" with a low profile within the sect.

This was naturally what he wanted.

Within the Primordial Origin Sect, none of those who could become Foundation Establishment True Persons are fools. Since he is now a subordinate of True Lord Qingyuan, it is the king's way to keep a low profile.

Xu Yunfan had long stopped counting the specific years, but based on the cycle of the four seasons and the subtle changes in his body's cultivation method, he clearly knew that the proficiency of the *Divine霄 True Scripture*, under the daily accumulation of a little progress and the consumption of large handfuls of pills, had finally climbed to 999 points.

He was only one step away from the "Great Completion" realm, which represented the imminent birth of a proto-grotto-heaven.

Zhang Ziyang couldn't help but sigh when he saw this.

"Yunfan, you have finally done it."

Xu Yunfan: "..."

Zhang Ziyang was at it again,打击人 (打击人) (discouraging people).

According to Zhang Ziyang's deduction, if he were to cultivate the *Divine霄 True Scripture*, he would at most need twenty years to reach perfection.

This was simply打击人 (打击人).

How could he, with a挂 (金手指) (cheat), be inferior to someone else?

Xu Yunfan表示 (表示) (stated) he didn't believe it.

On this day, it was no different from any other.

Xu Yunfan's mind was focused as he circulated the meridian pathways of the *Divine霄 Nine Firmament True Void Indestructible Scripture*.

Although the total amount of the immense spiritual power within his body was not growing quickly, after decades of continuous refinement and the increase in proficiency from the Attribute Panel, he was on the most perfect path to advancement, making its quality far surpass that of his peers.

Spiritual power flowed ceaselessly through his eight extraordinary meridians and the acupoints all over his body, finally sinking into the crystal-clear vessel of his Dao Foundation.

This Dao Foundation was like a miniature universe containing a vast nebula, quietly suspended in the core of his Dantian's Qi Sea.
