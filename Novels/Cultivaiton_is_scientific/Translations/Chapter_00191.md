# Chapter 191: Spirit Wine  

The slow-moving flying sword, concealed by the sea of lightning, swiftly reached the enraged Spirit Monkey King.  

Having witnessed the death of one of his white monkey subordinates, the Spirit Monkey King had grown even more frenzied. So much so that it failed to notice the sudden appearance of the flying sword, which struck its ribs.  

With a thunderous explosion, flesh and blood scattered as the Spirit Monkey King was sent flying. It let out a piercing shriek, its ribs now exposed through a gaping hole in its side.  

At the same time, the second white monkey was struck down by a Lightning Strike spell.  

If this battle continued, it was only a matter of time before both the Spirit Monkey King and the white monkeys were slain.  

The Spirit Monkey King's agonized cries prompted responses from the two surviving white monkeys—their voices filled with determination.  

Li Shiming's heart skipped a beat, but it was already too late. The two early-stage Foundation Establishment white monkeys detonated themselves simultaneously.  

Li Shiming's Nine Palaces Sword Formation could typically trap a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator unfamiliar with formations. However, those who understood formations and could identify the nodes were exceptions.  

Once the nodes were located, they could be attacked to break the formation.  

The self-destruction of the two early-stage Foundation Establishment white monkeys had the power to affect the formation's nodes, their destructive force rivaling that of a mid-stage Foundation Establishment attack.  

The Nine Palaces Sword Formation trembled under the explosion's impact, causing two of the spiritual swords to waver. This slight disruption destabilized the entire formation.  

Badly wounded, the Spirit Monkey King had prepared for escape upon hearing the white monkeys' cries. The moment the formation shattered, it transformed into a streak of white light, fleeing into the distance.  

"Don't let it escape! Spirit beasts hold grudges!" Xu Chuan urgently reminded.  

He was still gathering energy for his second secret technique, but it was too late to unleash it—otherwise, the Spirit Monkey King would have been doomed.  

Without hesitation, Li Shiming recalled his nine spiritual swords, which merged into a single beam of light, carrying him in pursuit of the fleeing monkey king.  

Xu Chuan had to first disperse his secret technique, as the immense spiritual energy stored in his flying sword prevented him from using sword teleportation. This delay allowed Li Shiming and the Spirit Monkey King to pull far ahead.  

The Spirit Monkey King was naturally agile, and speed was its greatest advantage. Now, fleeing for its life, its speed reached the pinnacle of mid-stage Foundation Establishment capabilities.  

Only Li Shiming's sword teleportation, enhanced by his Sword Bone Sword Intent, allowed him to keep up. Otherwise, the monkey king would have easily outrun him.  

Even so, after chasing for dozens of miles, the Spirit Monkey King disappeared around a bend.  

---  

Li Shiming's vision and spiritual sense expanded to their limits as he searched for any trace of the Spirit Monkey King.  

"There!" His sword light shot toward a seemingly impassable spot.  

IBMz15 had detected an anomaly—an inexplicable breeze rustling the grass on the mountainside.  

This breeze could only have originated from within the mountain, likely caused by the air displacement from the Spirit Monkey King's rapid movement.  

Sure enough, as he approached, he spotted a cave entrance nestled between two boulders.  

The entrance was ingeniously concealed—only visible up close, and from any other angle, it was completely hidden. Had the Spirit Monkey King not been severely injured and neglected to replace the rock covering the entrance, the cave would have remained undetectable.  

Li Shiming glanced back but saw no sign of Xu Chuan. Without waiting, he slipped inside the cave.  

The Spirit Monkey King was gravely injured, its mid-stage Foundation Establishment strength greatly diminished. Unlike cultivators, spirit beasts lacked life-saving techniques, making a wounded beast far easier to deal with than a wounded cultivator.  

The cave was pitch-black, but Li Shiming's spiritual sense served as his eyes, allowing him to navigate effortlessly.  

As he ventured deeper, the rich aroma of wine filled the air.  

"Monkey Wine!" he exclaimed, recalling descriptions from books about spirit monkeys' innate ability to brew wine.  

This was akin to alchemy for cultivators, though the quality of Monkey Wine varied greatly—some were mere mortal brews.  

Given that this group of spirit monkeys included a mid-stage Foundation Establishment king and four early-stage subordinates, the wine's quality was undoubtedly potent enough to affect mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Quickening his pace, he soon arrived at a spacious cavern. The wounded Spirit Monkey King was there, prying open a rock to scoop Monkey Wine into its mouth.  

Upon spotting Li Shiming, the monkey king let out a warning roar.  

Just the scent of the wine accelerated Li Shiming's blood flow, sending a rush of excitement through him.  

Having cultivated the *Diamond Body Protection Divine Art* and *Sword Demon Secret Codex*, his physique was extraordinarily robust.  

After reaching Foundation Establishment, despite the aid of the Wrathful Vajra Manifestation and his third-grade sword foundation, his body refinement progress had slowed considerably.  

The aroma of the Monkey Wine told him it was crucial for his physical cultivation.  

The effects of Monkey Wine were inconsistent—spirit monkeys could balance the energies within the brew, but the ingredients depended on what they could gather.  

These ingredients were spirit fruits, which spirit monkeys could procure from hidden environments inaccessible to cultivators.  

The monkeys couldn't determine the fruits' exact properties but could still brew the best possible wine from them.  

Fearing the Spirit Monkey King might destroy the wine, Li Shiming adopted a risky strategy—one that would mislead the beast about his combat style.  

He charged directly at the Spirit Monkey King, eschewing his usual lightning spells and flying swords.  

The Spirit Monkey King was intelligent, its wisdom far from low.  

Having observed Li Shiming's fighting style, it knew his strengths.  

Seeing him charge bare-handed, the monkey king was confident that, even severely wounded, its mid-stage Foundation Establishment strength and natural physical superiority would allow it to kill Li Shiming in close combat.  

Spirit beasts inherently surpassed humans in physique, and years of consuming spiritual resources only widened the gap.  

The Spirit Monkey King lunged forward, and Li Shiming watched as it moved away from the wine, easing his greatest concern.  

"Three meters, five meters, ten meters!" He calculated the distance between the monkey king and the wine. Once he deemed it safe, he engaged the beast.  

The *Sword Demon Secret Codex*'s close-combat techniques, combined with his third-grade sword foundation, made him a formidable melee fighter.  

The monkey king's claws clashed with the sword foundation, forcing Li Shiming back two steps while the beast staggered slightly.  

The first exchange left Li Shiming at a slight disadvantage, but the gap wasn't insurmountable, reassuring him.  

"Slash! Slash! Slash!" he roared, unleashing a flurry of sword strikes with blinding speed.  

Badly injured, the Spirit Monkey King's agility was compromised, and it sought to end the fight quickly.  

Its claws and legs became a blur as it attacked relentlessly.  

Li Shiming rarely displayed his melee prowess, but the *Sword Demon Secret Codex* was the strongest close-combat technique below the Golden Core stage.  

Forged from third-grade metal, the technique was designed for brutal, close-quarters swordplay.  

The cavern echoed with the clang of sword against claw and the sound of steel slicing flesh.  

Li Shiming's vision was supplemented by IBMz15's real-time analysis, predicting the monkey king's moves and guiding his counters.  

This made the fight easier—each block was followed by a slash that added another wound to the monkey king's body.  

The third-grade sword foundation's sharpness, infused with spiritual energy, made it as deadly as the finest spiritual swords.  

Had the Spirit Monkey King not relied on its combat instincts to evade fatal blows, it would have fallen long ago.  

But the mounting injuries slowed its movements. It thought of the Monkey Wine—even in death, it couldn't let its enemy claim it.  

It tried to retreat toward the wine to destroy it.  

Li Shiming noticed and, though he had hoped for a prolonged duel, the monkey king denied him the chance.  

After one last slash, he summoned Nezha beside the monkey king.  

The three-headed, six-armed Nezha appeared in a flurry of grabs. Its greatest strength lay in its extra limbs and omnidirectional vision.  

Six arms meant six zombie claws, and with the iron corpse's defense and strength, even Li Shiming couldn't guarantee victory in close combat—let alone the already weakened Spirit Monkey King.  

With a faint smile, Li Shiming disengaged and headed for the wine. The monkey king, realizing his intent, shrieked madly, but it was too late.  

At the wine's location, merely inhaling the aroma sent his blood surging again.  

His body's strength even increased slightly from the scent alone.  

"Priceless treasure!" His eyes gleamed as he retrieved a wine flask and used his spiritual sense to transfer the Monkey Wine into it.  

He had forgotten which fallen cultivator's spoils included this flask—a low-tier spiritual tool designed to store liquids and preserve their spiritual energy.  

Though only a mid-grade artifact, it was incredibly practical.  

The Monkey Wine filled the flask in seconds, and Li Shiming even scraped up the sediment—potentially useful for brewing his own spirit wine in the future.  

When he turned back to the battle, the Spirit Monkey King had fallen silent, its body riddled with deep gashes exposing bone.  

Li Shiming shook his head and ended its life with a single sword stroke.  

He carried the corpse outside—spirit beast remains were valuable materials, and since this was a joint encounter with Xu Chuan, they'd need to discuss its disposal.  

As for the Monkey Wine? That was his personal discovery.  

He had once carried spirit fish for body refinement, but after reaching Foundation Establishment, their effects had waned, and his supply had long since run out.  

His physical cultivation relied solely on his techniques, progressing sluggishly without external aids.  

Body refinement was notoriously resource-intensive in the cultivation world. While all cultivators recognized its benefits, few practiced it due to the prohibitive costs.  

For Li Shiming, his two body-refining techniques—*Diamond Body Protection Divine Art* and *Sword Demon Secret Codex*—demanded vast resources.  

The former required rare herbs and Buddhist enlightenment (which he bypassed with spirit fish and the Wrathful Vajra Manifestation), while the latter necessitated third-grade metals—materials typically reserved for crafting magic treasures, far beyond the reach of most Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Without resources, progress was painfully slow.  

He had planned to address this after joining a major sect, but the Monkey Wine presented an unexpected boon—one too precious to share.  

Exiting the cave, he found no sign of Xu Chuan. They must have missed each other.  

To signal Xu Chuan, Li Shiming released his thunder-attribute spiritual energy, broadcasting his presence.  

Given the spirit monkeys' territorial nature, no other beasts would be nearby to sense it.  

"Brother Li!" Xu Chuan's voice called out as he approached.  

Seeing the Spirit Monkey King's corpse in Li Shiming's hands, Xu Chuan looked ashamed. They had agreed on their roles—Li Shiming would handle the white monkeys while Xu Chuan took the king, with Li Shiming's formation ensuring an easy fight.  

Yet, the monkey king had escaped, and Li Shiming had finished it off.  

Xu Chuan felt useless, despite having dealt the initial heavy blow.
