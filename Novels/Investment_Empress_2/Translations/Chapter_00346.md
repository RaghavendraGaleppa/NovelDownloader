# Chapter 346: Magic Defeats Magic, God Replaces God!

The sun shone brightly high in the sky.

On the altar, the two sides stood in confrontation, and the air seemed to freeze for a moment.

The townspeople watched the figures on the altar with trepidation, not daring to even breathe loudly.

On one side was the priest who had presided over the rituals in the town for a long time, wielding immense authority as the spokesperson of the Witch Spirit, with no one daring to defy him.

On the other side, their background seemed even greater!

First of all, the arrival of these three was extraordinary in itself; they descended on clouds and mist, each carrying an imposing aura, like immortals among men.

Moreover... they claimed to have slept for ten thousand years?

Even a dynasty is said to be unable to last for ten thousand years. Just how ancient must that be? Yet, from their tone, it was as light and indifferent as if they were talking about taking a nap.

Thinking about it sent shivers down one's spine!

The townspeople were all poor commoners, still worrying about their livelihoods. They couldn't afford to offend either side and could only watch and wait.

"Impersonating a deity, you are seeking death!"

The fat priest was so furious that smoke seemed to billow from his seven orifices, managing to squeeze out only that much after a long while.

It was just that the other party had a一套套的 (一套套的 means a set of arguments or a smooth line of talk) of small talk, appearing far more professional than him...

He snorted coldly, deciding to stop arguing with the other party and fight with real power.

He bit the tip of his tongue, using a summoning technique, and spat a mouthful of blood from the tip of his tongue onto the bronze Witch Spirit statue. This caused the power of faith accumulated within to surge, awakening the residual ancestral spirit within.

Instantly, a phantom descended from the totem, manifesting a vivid and lifelike Feilian.

This was the ancestral spirit of the Feilian tribe, descending借助 (借助 means relying on) the power of faith, carrying a heavy oppressive aura. However, for him to single-handedly mobilize it came at a great cost.

Behind Li Mo, Ling Yuangou and Manbo exchanged a glance, seemingly preparing to make a move.

After all, the other party was at the eighth orifice of the Observation God Realm and had also utilized the power of faith.

They weren't worried that Li Mo couldn't defeat him, but rather that he might ruin the 'Heavenly尊 (尊 means尊, a title of respect, often translated as Lord or Venerable) Lord's' cool demeanor.

"The fake is fake, like a flower in a mirror or the moon's reflection in water."

Li Mo lowered his eyes, his expression unchanged:

"The power of the bloodline I once bestowed upon you, are you now using it against me?"

Suddenly, his form swirled and transformed.

A deer's head, a bird's body, surrounded by clouds and mist, incredibly divine. The power of his bloodline was like a great sun, pure and flawless.

The transformation via the Seventy-Two Transformations was indistinguishable from the true Feilian.

The fat priest's eyes widened in disbelief; it was as if he were seeing the ancestral spirit itself, even more real than the one he had凝聚 (凝聚 means condensed or manifested) with the power of faith!

After all, the essence of a totem is to use the power of faith to manifest the ancestral spirit, achieving a 'lifelike' effect.

But this is still a product condensed from bloodline power.

How could it attack its own 'original body'?

So, without any意外 (意外 means surprise or accident), the ancestral spirit condensed from the power of faith dissipated with a soft 'puff'.

"What say you?"

Li Mo calmly returned to his human form.

The fat priest was sweating profusely. He glanced at the wavering townspeople, knowing that in their hearts, his authority had already been shaken.

No matter how lifelike the totem was, it couldn't compare to a living 'deity' standing right before their eyes.

Impossible, absolutely impossible...

Every disciple of the Divine Sect knew that with the fall of the Great Shang's national fortune, those former deities could not possibly exist intact in this world.

There was only one exception, the Matriarch of the Azure Luan tribe.

And this young man, merely at the Observation God Realm, how could he be a pure-blood Feilian descended?

"True deities can summon wind, clouds, rain, and fog. Can you do that?"

The fat priest forced himself to remain calm.

"A minor trick."

Li Mo's expression remained indifferent as he snapped his fingers.

Unbeknownst to who, a sneeze was heard.

*Boom rumble rumble—*

The hidden Wu Qing received the signal. Shang Qinqing used a feather to tickle her nose, and she immediately let out a tremendous sneeze.

Thus, in the sky, clouds and mist gathered, and dark clouds covered the sky.

Manbo had always been Wu Qing's good friend and was very in sync. She also used her bloodline power.

So within the dark clouds, lightning snakes danced wildly, and thunderbolts crisscrossed!

*Whoosh whoosh whoosh—*

A torrential downpour began to fall uncontrollably.

"How... is this possible..."

The fat priest was left drenched and bewildered in the heavy rain.

---

Was this something someone in the Observation God Realm could cause?

To be honest, not to mention the villagers, even he himself was starting to doubt if the other party was the real deal.

Could he have joined a fake Divine Sect?

"No, what Wanxiang Immortal Sect, what Heavenly尊 Lord, where did you people come from? I've never even heard of you!"

"The people here have been able to thrive and survive to this day, all thanks to the grace and mercy of the Witch Spirit Lord! What does it have to do with you!"

Li Mo narrowed his eyes. He could have killed the fat priest long ago, but this man's death was不足惜 (不足惜 means not worth pitying). The most important thing was to establish the image of the Heavenly尊 Lord.

So he looked at him with pity, as if looking at an ant:

"Mortal fool, like a frog in a well."

"Are you a disciple of the Divine Summoning Sect?"

"??!!!"

The fat priest was exposed in one sentence and immediately panicked.

"However, since you have sincerely asked, I shall mercifully explain a thing or two to you."

"The Wanxiang Immortal Sect is a branch of the Heavenly Court. In ancient times, it suppressed the entire cosmos. I, the尊, swallowed the stars of the cosmos into my belly, governed the life and death of a world, and created all things."

"This so-called Divine Summoning Sect of yours only obtained a mere fraction of the Heavenly Court's legacy, yet you dare to show off in front of me? You are truly reversing the natural order!"

This was the Heavenly尊 Lord's plan!

Using magic to defeat magic! A god replacing a god!

The fat priest's body trembled, filled with disbelief.

However, he remembered the other party's realm, but before he could question it.

Seven Xuan Dans flew out from Li Mo's dantian, revolving in an arcane trajectory, truly resembling stars!

The fat priest was dumbfounded, and the bronze staff in his hand fell to the ground with a clang.

What the other party said could actually be justified.

It was even more terrifying and profound than what he had heard in the sect.

Seeing the gradually reverent gazes of the townspeople, Li Mo decided to deliver the final blow.

He looked far into the distance, towards one of the three great mountains:

"Are the people here trapped by these heavy mountains?"

"Immortal Lord, that is exactly the case!"

The old village chief stood in the rain, his belief in this Heavenly尊 Lord now nine-tenths convinced.

After all, he could summon wind and rain with a casual gesture, and even manifest a deity identical to the totem.

Actions speak louder than words.

Most of the villagers were like the old village chief; some couldn't help but kneel down.

Li Mo's eyelids twitched. He didn't dodge and let out a soft sigh:

"You have been deceived, yet your faith in me is sincere. Since that is the case..."

"I shall make a slight move."

He looked towards the three mountains, at the one in the very center, and shouted in a deep voice:

"Open!"

This shout was magnificent and imposing.

One second, two seconds, three seconds...

*Uhhhh*, nothing happened?

The townspeople looked at each other in confusion, not knowing what the Heavenly尊 Lord was doing.

Li Mo: "..."

Could that前辈 (前辈 means senior or senior fellow) Guo of the Giant Whale Clan have... fallen asleep again?

The Giant Whale Clan's habits were like this. They had long lifespans and enormous bodies. Because it wasn't easy to get full, they often slept to conserve energy. They could fall asleep at the drop of a hat, and sometimes were mistaken for islands by humans.

Fortunately, Li Mo had made full preparations.

"This kid is quite the smooth talker..."

"If the Divine Summoning Sect had learned a thing or two from him, they wouldn't be at this scale today."

Shang Qinqing spat out two melon seed shells, her figure穿梭 (穿梭 means to traverse or shuttle through) the void as she headed in the direction of Guo Chuan.

She arrived in an instant.

Guo Chuan was indeed asleep, lying next to a deep-sea heavy copper chain as thick as a water barrel, snoring loudly.

"Dumplings are ready!!"

"Huh?!"

Guo Chuan was startled awake, standing up straight as a ramrod.
