# Chapter 2: Replicating Experience

As night fell, Lu Xu quietly carried two large sacks back to his residence in the market district. The two hundred jin weight was nothing to him—before embarking on the path of cultivation, he had been a martial artist in the mortal world.

His dwelling was located in Red Maple Lane, a street on the outskirts of Qinghu Market. This area barely benefited from the second-grade spiritual vein at the market's core, leaving the spiritual energy exceedingly sparse. It was home to low-level Qi Refinement cultivators, one of the slums of the market district.

Lu Xu's small courtyard contained four two-story buildings, each housing one resident. As a complete newcomer, he stood in stark contrast to the other three veterans who had each spent decades in the cultivation world. Unfortunately, their talents were mediocre at best, and their cultivation levels unremarkable.

After storing the spirit rice in the first-floor storage room, Lu Xu rubbed his hands together, his eyes gleaming with anticipation. "Replicating Old Xu's talisman-making experience requires five spirit stones. I'll need to earn a few more somehow!" He glanced at the sacks of rice. "This spirit rice will have to do."

The next morning, Lu Xu knocked on the door of one of the buildings. Soon, a white-haired, hunched old man with deeply wrinkled face appeared. "Kid Lu? What brings you here so early?" the old man asked from the doorway.

Lu Xu smiled at the sight of him—this was the very Old Xu he'd been thinking about. Also known as Old Man Xu or Talisman Master Xu, his real name had long been forgotten. The octogenarian had spent his entire life in Qinghu Market as a first-grade talisman master.

"Old Xu, my spirit rice is ready for harvest!" Lu Xu said with enthusiastic smile.

Old Xu looked Lu Xu up and down, comprehension dawning in his eyes. "You want this old man to buy some from you?"

"Exactly! Didn't you say you were running low? The moment I had a harvest, I thought of you!"

"More like you're worried about not being able to sell it," Old Xu snorted. "But fine, I am short on rice. How much can you provide?"

"Two hundred jin!" Lu Xu gritted his teeth, reporting the full amount. He wasn't keeping any for himself—every resource now had to be devoted to replicating talisman-making experience.

"Two hundred jin? Done. I'll take it all at market price." Old Xu handed over five spirit stones.

"I'll bring the rice right away!" Lu Xu immediately returned to his room. Holding two of the stones, he silently willed them to disappear.

The replication points on the mysterious stele instantly increased to five. "Perfect, this will do!" Lu Xu struggled to contain his excitement as he hurriedly delivered all the rice to Old Xu.

"Old Xu, I'd also like to ask you about talisman-making."

"You want to learn talisman-making?" Old Xu's eyes widened as he scrutinized Lu Xu. Shaking his head, he delivered a blunt assessment: "I'm not saying this to discourage you, but talisman-making requires innate talent—something you might not possess. Moreover, the initial investment is substantial. The few spirit stones you have wouldn't even make a ripple. Don't tell me you're thinking of joining the Divine Talisman Hall like I did?"

At the mention of Divine Talisman Hall, Old Xu's eye twitched—clearly not a pleasant memory. Lu Xu knew the story well. In his youth, Old Xu had joined the hall, enduring years of hardship—five years of menial labor, a decade as an apprentice, followed by fifteen years mastering basic talisman techniques before finally becoming a first-grade talisman master. Then came twenty years repaying his training debt, living hand-to-mouth until finally gaining freedom at sixty.

With such experience, it was no wonder Old Xu was skeptical. The path of talisman-making was arduous, not for the faint of heart. What Old Xu didn't know was that Lu Xu's questions were merely a pretense—his real goal was to freely replicate the experience while establishing an alibi for his sudden talisman-making skills.

As Old Xu spoke, Lu Xu silently invoked: "View talisman-making experience!" A cyan light rose from the stele, merging into Lu Xu's eyes as text appeared:

[First-grade Lower-tier Talisman Master: 5/100]

This was one of the stele's abilities—to assess others' mastery. However, it could only be used once per person per year, requiring careful selection of targets to avoid encountering skills requiring unaffordable replication costs. Old Xu was Lu Xu's carefully chosen target.

"Replicate!" Lu Xu commanded internally. In a flash of cyan light, a torrent of information flowed from Old Xu into Lu Xu's being.

His eyes glazed over as knowledge flooded his mind—Restraining Qi Talisman, Fire Bullet Talisman, Wind Riding Talisman... Countless talisman-related concepts materialized instantly. He suddenly became as experienced as a decades-long talisman master, inheriting all of Old Xu's hard-won knowledge about materials, techniques, and spiritual energy application.

"Kid Lu? You alright?" Old Xu asked, puzzled by Lu Xu's dazed expression. Had his harsh words shattered the young man's spirit?

"Cough, I'm fine—just lost in thought," Lu Xu quickly recovered. "Your temperament needs refinement before you should even consider talisman-making," Old Xu shook his head.

"My interest is genuine. I'll bring you spirit rice annually if you'll teach me." After some grumbling, Old Xu relented, inviting Lu Xu inside where they spent two hours discussing talisman theory. Lu Xu left with a used talisman brush (1 spirit stone), eighty sheets of first-grade lower-tier blank talisman paper (2 spirit stones), and a box of spirit ink made from demon beast blood (a gift).

"My spirit stones are gone as quickly as they came," Lu Xu sighed at his empty purse. "Back to mortal food it is." While Qi Refinement cultivators hadn't achieved true fasting, their spirit-enhanced bodies suffered from impurities in mortal food. Only those truly destitute resorted to it—an irony not lost on Lu Xu, who muttered, "The farmer can't afford his own rice. Who'd believe it?"

Returning home, Lu Xu examined his status:
[Name: Lu Xu]
[Lifespan: 16/103]
[Cultivation: Qi Refinement Layer 1]
[Spiritual Roots: Wood (Medium-Low)]
[Technique: Green Wood Art (Novice) 26/100]
[Replication Points: 0]
[Skills—Spells]:
Minor Cloud Rain Technique (Novice): 76/100
Geng Metal Sword (Novice): 44/100
Sharpness Technique (Novice): 32/100
[Skills—Talisman]:
First-grade Lower-tier Talisman Master: 5/100

The new talisman skill appeared without any practice—Lu Xu had literally bought his way into mastery. "No amount of talent or hard work compares to spending money," he mused. From today, he'd transition from Farmer Lu to Talisman Master Lu!

Settling cross-legged, Lu Xu prepared his first talisman with surprising proficiency that would have stunned Old Xu. After several attempts, his eighth sheet finally glowed as the Restraining Qi Talisman activated successfully. 

Exhaustion soon followed—creating talismans drained both energy and focus. Recalling Old Xu's limits (two successes or six attempts daily), Lu Xu realized his performance exceeded even a third-layer Qi Refinement cultivator's capacity. "Perhaps my transmigrator's soul grants stronger mental endurance," he speculated before collapsing into deep sleep.

By morning, he awoke refreshed, ready to continue his newfound path as a talisman master.
