# Chapter 133: Old Dog

The children, however, felt no pain. Still smiling, they continued to sing their rhymes until they fell silent and motionless. Their bodies were then processed by the cultists into the Elixir of Longevity.

Yan Yuwei’s grip on her greatsword tightened, blue veins bulging on her hand. A surge of fury nearly shattered her molars.

Xu Yunfan grabbed her wrist, his eyes darting to the edge of the corpse pile. There, curled up, was a youth wearing the outer disciple attire of the Heavenly Work Cave. His chest rose and fell weakly.

"Save..."

The youth suddenly opened his eyes and cried out, but his vocal cords were pierced through by an iron hook.

The old priest, wearing a benevolent smile, lifted a clay pot. His murky eyes reflected the churning blood foam inside. "The thirty-sixth medicinal guide is complete. With this sacrifice in Cuibo City, the Ming Lord should manifest and descend. Our great cause will finally be achieved."

In that instant, Xu Yunfan’s Thunderfire Hammer tore through the air.

The force of the hammer wind knocked three black-robed men flying. Seizing the momentum, Xu Yunfan snatched the youth and retreated rapidly.

Unwilling to be outdone, Yan Yuwei ignored the fresh wounds splitting open across her body. She swung her greatsword with a piercing shriek. The explosive force of her Molten Gold Forging Technique sent shattered stones flying, clearing a path through the mountain of corpses.

"Head Steward Zhou?!"

Yan Yuwei froze, her longsword subconsciously lowering.

Walking slowly out from the sea of blood and mountains of corpses was a grey-robed old man—Zhou Yuande, the Head Steward of the External Affairs Hall of the Heavenly Work Cave!

The old man’s kind-looking face was splattered with blood spots, and he held half a piece of Fuling cake he hadn't finished eating.

But he was simply too old. Most of his teeth had fallen out, and his vital energy was枯败 and decaying to the extreme; it wouldn't be surprising if he died at any moment.

"I've been waiting for you."

Zhou Yuande wiped the crumbs from his lips. "I have already sent word to the Heavenly Work Cave. You two are the main pillars of our true disciples. Don't wander outside. If something were to happen, it would be hard to explain. Come with me..."

"Sent word, my ass!"

Yan Yuwei cleaved a charging black-robed man in two, a growl rolling in her throat. "Look at the tragedy in Cuibo City! Not even a message could be sent out. Head Steward Zhou, you have contributed greatly!"

Zhou Yuande looked puzzled. "What are you talking about, Niece? Isn't Cuibo City doing just fine?"

"The Incense Fire Cult is slaughtering the city from within, and you are mingling with these heretics!"

Yan Yuwei raised her longsword, pointing it directly at Zhou Yuande, shouting curses without end.

"You wretched old thing, you are unworthy to be called a human!"

Seeing their wariness, Zhou Yuande’s smile suddenly cracked into a spiderweb of wrinkles.

He tremblingly raised his right hand.

The back of that hand was covered with liver spots, and iron filings were embedded in the gaps under his fingernails.

"Look! Look at these hands!" The roar startled the cold crows in the treetops. "Why can you be in the prime of your youth, while I have to take the Life-Prolonging Five Venom Powder every day!"

Xu Yunfan’s pupils constricted.

He noticed a purple patch on the side of Zhou Yuande’s neck—the mark of long-term consumption of snake and scorpion venom.不知是什么方法, he was actually using poison to sustain his life.

The old man’s sleeve vaguely revealed a section of an iron tube—it was the mechanism box for the 'Thousand Mechanism Guide' from the Heavenly Work Cave’s Mechanism Hall, capable of injuring those who have tempered their blood.

Xu Yunfan had coveted it for a long time, but the short, dark old man in charge refused to give it to him. He never expected that Zhou Yuande of the External Affairs Hall would possess one.

"The Ming Lord shall descend and grant me eternal life..."

Zhou Yuande tore open his clothes maniacally, revealing a festering sore on his heart. This decaying body was as thin as a harp bone, the wrinkled skin hanging loose, looking terrifying.

"Just offer three more cities of living souls, and this skin..."

"You deserve to die!"

Yan Yuwei roared, stepping forward instantly. Her greatsword hacked down toward Zhou Yuande’s head.

Zhou Yuande showed no panic; he even revealed a mouthful of rotten teeth as he opened the bronze compass embedded in his chest.

Twelve golden threads extended from the disk surface into his sleeves, connecting to the joints of the bronze puppets. "Nephew Xu, have you ever felt the taste of the Hundred Refinements Entangling Silk Strength?"

Before Yan Yuwei’s greatsword could strike, seven iron caltrop nets suddenly exploded from the ground.

Xu Yunfan took the lead, pulling her back and flipping onto a sour jujube tree. The spot where they had stood was now钉满 with poisoned steel needles—the silkworm threads tied to the needle tails glinted with cold light in the twilight.

"Heavenly Piles linked with Seven Star Patches," Yan Yuwei realized, throwing half a piece of bark backward. The bark was torn to shreds by iron caltrops shooting from the shadows. Her expression turned grave. "The old thing has transformed the entire graveyard into a mechanism array!"

Zhou Yuande’s枯 fingers trembled rapidly, and the twelve bronze puppets suddenly sprang up.

Each puppet extended invisible black-gold threads from their joints. The other ends of the threads were wrapped around the black iron rings on his fingers.

The two leading puppets opened their iron jaws, spraying phosphorus fire powder that ignited instantly upon hitting the air!

"Hold your breath!"

Xu Yunfan’s wrist moved slightly. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer transformed into a chain hammer and flew out, surging toward Zhou Yuande.

Zhou Yuande’s fingers trembled. The invisible black-gold threads shook, and several bronze puppets flew in to forcibly block the flying hammer.

The moment the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer struck the bronze puppet, the puppet’s chest exploded.

Sulfur smoke mixed with iron sand splashed out. The black-gold threads of three puppets melted into molten iron in the high heat, bringing with it the explosive power of a cannonball.

Countless iron pellets instantly blasted into Xu Yunfan, producing the sound of metal clashing. For a moment, a chaotic clanging rang out.

Although it caused no real damage, it left Xu Yunfan covered in dust and dirt.

The humiliation was immense.

"Watch closely, you old dog!"

His latissimus dorsi muscles surged like angry waves as he swung the Thunderfire Hammer in a full moon arc.

The hammer chain wrapped around the neck of the fourth puppet, using it like a meteor hammer to smash toward Zhou Yuande’s face.

The old man’s枯 fingers trembled rapidly. The remaining puppets stacked into a shield wall, but were shattered by the immense force carrying the debris of the first three puppets.

Zhou Yuande stumbled backward, two fingers on his black iron ring hand broken.

A body over a hundred years old could not keep up with the reaction speed. Xu Yunfan’s hammer shadows poured down like a storm.

The first hammer shattered the left shoulder lockbone, bone shards piercing through the grey robe. The second hammer smashed into the right knee, shattering the kneecap into seventeen or eighteen pieces. The third hammer went straight for the crown of the head, barely blocked by an iron bone umbrella.

"When I was roaming the江湖 back in the day..." Zhou Yuande spat blood from his mouth, a poisoned short blade popping out from the umbrella handle mechanism.

"Outdated tricks!"

Xu Yunfan spun and kicked the umbrella surface, using the force to wrap the hammer chain around the tree three times.

As his waist and abdominal muscles tightened like a bowstring, the entire cypress tree was uprooted. Carrying a thousand-jun weight, it swept horizontally.

Zhou Yuande’s pupils reflected the whistling tree crown. In his ears sounded the sigh of his master from fifty years ago: "No matter how many schemes you calculate, it is inferior to a single force that conquers all."

"Ming, Ming Lord, save me!!!"

Zhou Yuande howled, his voice sharp like a恶鬼.

"Boom!"

The cypress tree smashed through the last three puppets and, without losing momentum, slammed Zhou Yuande into the mountain wall.

The rock wall cracked like a spiderweb. The old man was embedded in the fissure, his chest cavity depressed like a broken drum.

Xu Yunfan lifted the heavy hammer. His muscles writhed like a group of pythons twisting, unleashing immense power.

"Bang!"

The sound of the heavy hammer colliding and the rock wall collapsing rang out simultaneously.

When Xu Yunfan dragged the headless corpse to the ground, the head of the Thunderfire Hammer was still dripping with brain matter.
