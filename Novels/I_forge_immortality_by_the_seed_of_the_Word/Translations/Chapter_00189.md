Chapter 186: The Eve

The night was deep. A profound silence enveloped Human Paragon Island. The four rounds of battles during the day had concluded, and almost all cultivators were seizing the time to meditate and recuperate. Although after each battle, the Spirit of the Secret Realm would replenish everyone's depleted mana and divine sense, the mental exhaustion could only be adjusted by the cultivators themselves.

At a certain moment, in a secluded spot on the island, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes. His gaze instinctively drifted upwards. The scroll, shimmering with a faint glow, still hung in the sky. However, the order of names on it had subtly changed.

[Rank A1: Chang Jin, Wins: 4]
[Rank A2: Blackwater, Wins: 4]
...
[Rank B1: Zhang Jing, Wins: 4]
...

A moment later, Zhang Jing retracted his gaze. A hint of surprise flickered in his eyes. "Only four battles have passed, yet merely seventeen individuals have secured all four wins. This includes six beings from the Myriad Spirit Races camp, Chang Jin among them!"

"It seems the competition for the final ranking battle will be far more intense than previously anticipated," Zhang Jing mused inwardly. "These individuals, having stood out from thirty-eight million Foundation Establishment cultivators, truly are not to be underestimated. But this is good too. The stronger the opponents, the greater the inspiration and assistance they provide for my comprehension and integration of various Dao intents." Thinking this, Zhang Jing smiled faintly, then closed his eyes again. His aura gradually settled, as if he were waiting for the germination of a certain special seed.

Time flowed by leisurely. Unconsciously, twenty days had passed. In the center of a certain arena, Zhang Jing's eyes were slightly closed. Behind his head, the five-colored spiritual light of the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud circulated erratically, shimmering with a hazy, illusory essence. And in the very center of the Auspicious Cloud, an eye had clearly opened. Its indifferent gaze landed directly on the Water-Evasion Deer opposite him, which was only about twelve feet tall and small and agile in build. Various insights suddenly appeared in his mind: Integration! Assimilation! Domination!

"So the Dao of Water has so many variations!" Zhang Jing's eyes grew even brighter. This creature, named Water-Evasion, actually specialized in cultivating the Dao of Water. Every move it made was imbued with various Water Dao intents, and it could effortlessly draw in endless water-attribute immortal spiritual energy. It was like a favored child of the Dao of Water. Its strength was utterly terrifying, even stronger than the Mountain-Bearing Mighty Goat Demon and the Red-Eyed Golden Roc he had encountered on the arena before.

According to Zhang Jing's estimation, this creature should be the strongest among the Myriad Spirit Races participating in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, second only to Chang Jin. In just a short time, Zhang Jing had gained a wealth of insights into the Water Dao from it. "These powerful races from the Myriad Spirit Races camp are truly living treasures." His gaze involuntarily swept towards the other arenas, lingering for a moment on several other beings from the Myriad Spirit Races camp whom he had not yet encountered. A hint of anticipation suddenly arose in his heart.

Just then, as if he had discovered something, Zhang Jing's gaze suddenly sharpened. In his line of sight, two familiar figures appeared simultaneously on an empty arena. Their colossal auras immediately began to clash, actually compressing the surrounding air into visible distorted ripples, which then rapidly spread outwards, stirring up violent gales. The massive commotion instantly attracted dozens of gazes.

"Ji Changyu and Qu Junhou, they actually ran into each other?" A look of interest flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. He knew clearly in his heart that Qu Junhou would not be Ji Changyu's opponent, especially after Ji Changyu had undergone some kind of transformation. "However... this doesn't mean Qu Junhou can be easily handled by him. After all, the strange Five Elements Yuan Magnetic Annihilation Force that Qu Junhou wields is also exceedingly formidable. This battle will likely force Ji Changyu to reveal some new abilities."

Zhang Jing's eyes flickered slightly. For him, this was undoubtedly a rare opportunity to observe his direct competitor. Although even with Ji Changyu's transformed strength, he still had confidence in securing the final victory. But this time, it ultimately concerned innate divine abilities and whether his Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud could directly ascend to the Immortal Seed rank. Caution is the parent of safety; being a little cautious was never wrong. "In that case... I need to finish this quickly." A serious expression flashed across Zhang Jing's face, and he immediately focused all his attention on the Water-Evasion Deer opposite him.

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Clang! Clang!* The Many-Treasures River quietly appeared before him, and he grasped it firmly.

Opposite him, the Water-Evasion Deer suddenly felt a terrifying crisis descend upon it, its heart seemingly gripped tightly by an invisible hand. A chill instantly spread to every corner of its body. Yet at this moment, a hint of relief couldn't help but flash in its eyes. "This torment is finally going to end!"

***

Before, the Water-Evasion Deer didn't understand why the Red-Eyed Golden Roc and the Goat Demon looked so terrified after their battles with this human named Zhang Jing. But after experiencing it personally this time, it finally understood. Battling that guy opposite was like struggling in a deep pit of despair from beginning to end. There was no glimmer of hope to be seen; one could only sink deeper and deeper! The crucial point was that the opponent could clearly eliminate it with a single strike, yet he remained unhurried, taking his time, as if a cat playing with a mouse, until it had been thoroughly stripped bare, with not a single secret left. This horrifying feeling of slowly stepping towards suffocation, the Water-Evasion Deer would die before wanting to experience it a second time!

Recovering its senses, in its vision, a surging, turbulent river instantly spanned the sky, sweeping towards it with an irresistible, mighty force. The next moment, "This guy... where did he get such deep enmity with our Myriad Spirit Races camp?!" Only this thought managed to flash through the Water-Evasion Deer's mind. Then, its vision went black, and it lost all sensation.

***

On Human Paragon Island, after hearing the commotion of the Water-Evasion Deer being defeated, everyone merely glanced lightly, their faces revealing an unsurprised expression. They then immediately refocused their attention on the impending battle between Ji Changyu and Qu Junhou. Their eyes were filled with anticipation.

On the arena, "Fellow Daoist Qu, please make your move first." Ji Changyu stood with his hands clasped behind his back, a faint smile on his face. An overbearing aura, as if looking down upon the world, naturally emanated from him.

Opposite him, Qu Junhou's face was uncharacteristically filled with nervousness; not a shred of his previous arrogance could be found. A man's reputation precedes him. Facing Ji Changyu before him, his heart was filled with nothing but nervousness. Two-thirds of the final ranking battles had passed, and everyone had experienced sixty to seventy battles of varying sizes. Yet, up until now, no one had been able to force the opponent to use a second move. Even a formidable opponent like the Water-Evasion Deer couldn't. His strength was unbelievably formidable!

Qu Junhou bowed slightly, taking a deep breath. "Please enlighten me, Senior Daoist." As soon as his words fell, strands of five-colored light immediately surged from his nostrils, and a terrifying aura capable of annihilating all things in heaven and earth instantly permeated the air.

"Good! Fellow Daoist's methods are truly extraordinary!" Seeing this, Ji Changyu praised. The expression on his face became slightly more serious.

***

Not long after, below, on Human Paragon Island, a flash of white light appeared. Qu Junhou instantly appeared beside Zhang Jing, a complex expression of fright and shock still lingering in his eyes.

"Brother Qu, how do you feel? Did you gain anything from this battle?" Zhang Jing asked with a smile.

Hearing this, Qu Junhou forced himself to rally his spirits and said with lingering fear: "Strong! This person is strong, truly like a monster! And Chang Jin too! I originally thought that even if I couldn't win, I could at least hold on for a while against them, but I didn't expect—" A bitter smile immediately appeared on his face. "I still overestimated myself too much. Our time in the Heavenly Realm is ultimately too short; in terms of foundation, we are indeed far inferior to these true monsters." Afterwards, he seemed to realize something, suddenly looking at Zhang Jing and reminding him with a serious expression: "The horror of those two can only be truly felt when you stand before them on the arena. What you see from below the stage isn't even one-ten-thousandth of it! Brother Zhang, although your strength is far greater than mine, if you encounter them... you must be extremely careful." A hint of worry subtly emerged in Qu Junhou's voice.

"Understood, thank you for the reminder, Brother Qu." Zhang Jing nodded in response. A faint smile, however, flickered in his eyes. Qu Junhou might not have realized it because he was in the thick of it, but he, watching from below, had seen it perfectly clear. Just as he had predicted, although the battle between the two earlier was incredibly brief, lasting only a few breaths in total, it was precisely within this short time that Ji Changyu had already exposed quite a few things.

***

Time flew by, and another nine days passed. During these nine days, Zhang Jing finally, as he wished, encountered several other beings from the Myriad Spirit Races camp on the arena, and successfully comprehended a trace of their race-specific Dao and principles from them. Coupled with the insights gained from other individuals, "The integration of thirty-six Dao intents finally has some direction."

"Unfortunately, only one day remains, and it's also... the day that will determine the final Foundation Establishment rankings of this Proud Cloud Secret Realm!" Zhang Jing couldn't help but raise his head and look at the scroll in the sky. His expression suddenly became profound.

[Rank A1: Chang Jin, Wins: 96]
[Rank B1: Zhang Jing, Wins: 96]
[Rank C1: Ji Changyu, Wins: 96]
...

Perhaps it was done intentionally by the Spirit of the Secret Realm. As of today, only three individuals, Zhang Jing included, still maintained a perfect win record. This also meant that tomorrow would see the clash between these three, and from them, the true number one would be decided!
