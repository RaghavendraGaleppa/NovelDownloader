# Chapter 149: The Ancestral Court Elders' Wondrous Medicine Was Harvested

The night mist was thick, and the rain continued to fall. The majestic mountain was littered with debris: four-colored feathers, crimson scales, broken silver quills... all stained with blood. Any outsider arriving would be shocked to see old, battered demons lying scattered across the mountaintop. Qin Ming stood as if bathed in golden sunlight, impervious to the torrential rain, not a single drop touching him. He gazed at his spoils with immense satisfaction.

"Bring the wondrous medicine."

The old donkey shivered, then shakily got to its feet. Ignoring the Black Roc's murderous glare, it reverently carried the pure, flawless crystal over to Qin Ming. Qin Ming smiled as he took it. Within the head-sized crystal, a strong black light pulsed, and the black liquid appeared exceptionally potent and extraordinary.

The Black Roc couldn't accept this; its bald body trembled with rage. Its beak was almost bitten through. This was a grand medicine it had acquired at immense cost from a renowned elder of its own clan, and now it was benefiting an enemy! It opened its mouth to spew a black light, but Qin Ming kicked it away, causing cracks to appear on its beak.

"Stop!"

"King!"

This was the Black Roc's territory, and some of its loyal subordinates, mostly bird demons, flapped their wings and rushed over, trying to rescue it. Qin Ming raised the Jade-Iron Saber in his hand, first cleaving apart a few raptors, then directly summoning lightning. Instantly, silver snakes danced chaotically across the mountaintop, and electric light interwove. Amidst the deafening electric light, a flock of raptors were all pierced through, falling to the ground, all dead. At this moment, though Qin Ming appeared refined and ethereal, to the old demons, he was undoubtedly like a young demon god. He raised his saber, drawing lightning from the night sky to strike down a group of bird demons, creating an immense deterrent force that made many demons tremble uncontrollably.

"Move all your sworn brothers into that tall building," Qin Ming instructed the old donkey.

"Third Brother, you're truly spineless!" the Fire Qilin Lion roared.

The old donkey hung its head, not daring to look at the lion. Its front hooves circulated Heavenly Radiance energy as it dragged its sworn second brother towards the grand palace. "Old Donkey Third, do you think he'll let you go just like that?" the large silver hedgehog spoke, grimacing in pain because all its quills had been shot out and its entire body was bleeding.

Qin Ming walked over and took the silver bow with cloud patterns from its hand, exclaiming, "What a fine bow! It can even adjust its power as needed. With this, I won't have to change weapons for a long time." The silver hedgehog's eyes spewed fire, but alas, it was itself a prisoner, and threats were meaningless. Qin Ming ignored it, kicking off the mask of the human man he had severely wounded, revealing a middle-aged face, appearing to be in his thirties.

"Speak, where are you from, and why are you targeting me?"

To his surprise, the man was very cooperative, saying, "I am from the 'Pseudo-God Society' on the Divine Ruin Plains, invited by the Black Roc to assist."

Soon, Qin Ming learned that the supreme leader of this organization might be connected to a pseudo-god creature! The Pseudo-God Society on the Divine Ruin Plains was merely a small branch node of the organization, not large in scale. The masked man was the second-in-command of this node.

In a tall building constructed of black gold stone, Qin Ming called the old donkey over and asked, "Last time I went to the Wolf Temple, how did you know I was coming in advance?"

"News delivered by the Pseudo-God Society," the old donkey replied.

"Is that so?" he then asked the man lying on the ground.

"We indeed deal in 'information business,' but I'm not clear about this matter. Our boss handles it personally."

Qin Ming performed a spiritual resonance and found that neither the old donkey nor the man was lying. At that time, the Pseudo-God Society had sent a bird demon to deliver the message, and the Black Roc paid a considerable fee. A chill appeared on Qin Ming's face. The Pseudo-God Society, whose boss at this node was also human, actually sold information about their own kind to other races. He pressed for the organization's location and more detailed information.

Then, he smiled slightly, "I'm quite interested in your swordplay. Let's discuss and exchange some insights."

The man's face was expressionless; this was clearly an attempt to steal his sword manual! He was certain he wouldn't survive, so why should he hand it over? He had already accumulated some Heavenly Radiance, preparing to end his own life to avoid further suffering. However, Qin Ming was spiritually resonating with him, instantly dispersing his Heavenly Radiance and preventing his suicide.

"Speak quickly, recite the full sword art, and I'll give you a quick death," Qin Ming said.

The man was stubborn, with various negative emotional fluctuations surging within him. Finally, he recited a sword art full of "traps," named the "Blazing Sun Sword Scripture."

This manual was exceptionally profound, having once produced Grandmaster-level swordsmen! Qin Ming spiritually resonated with him, sifting out the impurities and preserving the essence, seeing clear scenes unfold and thus obtaining the complete scripture. Finally, he wielded the Mutton-Fat Jade-Iron Saber, performing the Blazing Sun Sword Scripture right there. It wasn't long before faint sparks of fire began to emerge from the snow-white blade.

"Impossible!" the man exclaimed in shock. The scripture he had recited was riddled with errors and full of pitfalls; anyone who practiced according to it would surely suffer consequences. Moreover, even if he had recited the true scripture, how could that youth comprehend it in such a short time? Even the patriarchs of various sects would struggle to grasp it instantly at that age.

"Indeed, a very profound sword scripture, worthy of being called an ultimate art," Qin Ming commented seriously, praising it sincerely, and then sheathed his saber. The man felt his mind spinning. The other party had actually learned his family's inherited sword scripture! He couldn't accept it. What kind of monstrous talent was this? He could even master a flawed scripture!

Qin Ming caught a sparrow that had just undergone its first mutation, preparing to test the medicine on it. He opened the pure crystal, and immediately a rich fragrance wafted out, causing several old demons to involuntarily cast their gazes. The Black Roc's entire body trembled, its eyes bloodshot with rage. If it had known this, it would rather have poured out this wondrous blood. Now, watching its opponent refine it, its mind collapsed.

Qin Ming first used Heavenly Radiance to temper a drop of the glowing black liquid, injecting its medicinal properties into the sparrow's body, and observed its condition. The medicine's effect was immediate. The sparrow's eyes became much clearer, its spiritual intelligence clearly enhanced, and its foundation seemed to have been elevated. Qin Ming waited for a long time, and the sparrow showed no signs of trouble. In fact, its condition improved steadily, as if it had awakened "divine wisdom," becoming much smarter than its previously dull-witted state. He finally felt relieved and began refining the wondrous blood within the crystal.

Black light swirled, mists ascended, and the rich medicinal fragrance enveloped Qin Ming. He was using methods from the "Fate-Changing Scripture" to extract the most essential medicinal properties. "Ah..." The Black Roc was so heartbroken it couldn't breathe, screaming and banging its head on the ground, trying to end its own life. The old donkey immediately stepped forward to stop it, dispersing its accumulated Heavenly Radiance. This was a task Qin Ming had assigned it: to prevent the old demons from dying.

"Third Brother, Lu Chongxiao, you son of a b*tch, you've completely stopped doing any bird-related things!" The Black Roc was beside itself with rage.

Qin Ming walked over, continuing to refine the black wondrous blood in the crystal, and used the opportunity of its intense emotional fluctuations to extract valuable information. "As a Roc, don't you have some ultimate techniques hidden away? I feel like you're quite weak."

The Black Roc stared at the crystal in Qin Ming's hand, already on the verge of madness. Now, provoked, its eyes were bloodshot, and it propped up its lightning-scarred, black-and-red body, intent on fighting Qin Ming to the death. Soon, Qin Ming learned that it possessed a damaged "Black Roc Scripture." It was truly difficult to spiritually resonate and obtain scripture from a mad creature. After much effort, Qin Ming finally acquired this incomplete scripture. The Black Roc Steps and Roc Claw Skill within were quite powerful, both activated by Black Roc energy. This scripture explained how to cultivate after transforming into human form, so the subsequent post-transformation techniques were also applicable to humans.

"You are a good bird, willing to make sacrifices," Qin Ming said, having gained much. Not wanting to humiliate it further, he slapped its head, instantly killing it.

At the same time, he refined the most essential medicinal properties from the black wondrous blood in the crystal and absorbed them all into his body. Instantly, the vitality of his flesh and blood increased, as if he were about to ascend amidst radiant clouds, with light mist swirling around him. He stood still for a long time, silently comprehending the changes within himself. His foundation had indeed been elevated!

"At this point, every small step forward is incredibly difficult. Breaking through my current limits is by no means easy, but I saw hope, and I succeeded."

Qin Ming turned his gaze to the Brocade Sparrow. Fearing he might frighten the other old demons, he took it to a side hall. He first performed a spiritual resonance, only to find that all the techniques it possessed were avian methods, completely unsuitable for humans. Finally, he directly extracted its wondrous blood and refined it there. His body was enveloped in colorful mists, emitting wafts of clear fragrance. This grand medicine was extremely precious. After he fully absorbed the essence of the medicine, his bones crackled, and the Golden Thread Jade Robe automatically appeared, then vanished again. His foundation seemed to have crossed a threshold.

Qin Ming felt that his initial foundation had surpassed the strength of sixteen hundred *jin*. He sighed lightly, confirming it was indeed difficult. From the Yellow Abyss, to the Silver Wolf King, then the Black Roc clan's wondrous medicine, and now the Brocade Sparrow's wondrous blood—a total of four types—they had only raised his initial foundation to over sixteen hundred *jin*. In truth, at this point, raw strength was less helpful in his combat; in the future, it would primarily rely on the qualitative change of Heavenly Radiance energy. However, the initial foundation indicated a certain potential. The value of sixteen hundred *jin* didn't actually represent that much physical strength, but rather the future height and depth of his cultivation! None of the patriarchs of various sects throughout history had reached the threshold of fifteen hundred *jin*, which spoke volumes.

"It's truly difficult to improve further upwards!" Qin Ming lamented. Fortunately, there was still one more type of wondrous blood outside that could be used.

Qin Ming returned to the grand palace and looked at the Fire Qilin Lion, but didn't immediately act. After absorbing two wondrous medicines consecutively, he needed to rest and recover. "Did I not undergo an eighth rebirth because these two types of wondrous blood, like the Yellow Abyss's wondrous blood, only increase foundation and don't promote rebirth? Or is it that my seventh rebirth just completed, making another rebirth impossible in a short period?" Qin Ming pondered, though he wasn't overly concerned.

"Brother Hedgehog, did you say you wanted me to scrub your back and rinse your quills?" Qin Ming asked, approaching with the Mutton-Fat Jade-Iron Saber in hand. Hearing this, the large silver hedgehog immediately felt ashamed and resentful. The situation was against it; some words had been spoken too soon, and now it was left speechless by the taunt.

"I observe your archery is extraordinary, truly master-level. Let's spar and exchange insights," Qin Ming smiled.

"You're dreaming! I won't teach you archery!" The large hedgehog saw through his intentions.

Qin Ming didn't get angry. He directly recited the archery methods he had mastered right in front of it, genuinely exchanging knowledge. He asked, "How does it compare to your archery?"

Though the large hedgehog had lost all its quills and was covered in blood, it still wore an arrogant expression, saying, "Your archery manual is quite ordinary. What I possess is a transcendent archery scripture!"

"Then recite a passage. Let me see what makes it extraordinary!" Qin Ming argued with it.

"Then listen well, let me broaden your horizons!" The large hedgehog was very stingy, indeed only reciting one section.

"Quite ordinary. I think it's not as miraculous as my own archery."

...

Qin Ming pushed its limits, constantly making its emotions fluctuate violently. Even he felt tired, but finally, he obtained the complete "Archery Scripture"! This manual could be said to be extraordinarily remarkable, considered an ultimate art even among major sects. In comparison, the archery Qin Ming obtained from the Wu family on Black-White Mountain was no longer impressive. When the large hedgehog saw Qin Ming holding a large bow, practicing archery in the rain, it instantly felt like it was seeing a ghost! It had studied this "Archery Scripture" for many years, naturally knowing its intricacies, and could tell at a glance that Qin Ming had grasped its core secrets, which were usually not passed on.

"How... how is this possible? How could you learn it?" It was shocked. Even if it had taught the complete Archery Scripture, the other party couldn't possibly master it instantly, could they?

Qin Ming was confident in his own talent. He merely smiled faintly at it, offering no response.

"Are you human, ghost, or god?!" the large hedgehog exclaimed, distraught.

Patriarch-level talent was certainly no joke. Qin Ming already possessed superb archery skills, and now he had attained divine mastery in it!

"You are a good hedgehog, willing to make sacrifices. I'll give you a quick death." Qin Ming shattered its head with a palm strike, cleanly sending it on its way.

"I'd rather kill myself than be at your mercy!" the Fire Qilin Lion roared.

Qin Ming paid it no mind and didn't stop it. He said, "Suit yourself. Besides the heart containing the wondrous Fire Qilin blood, there's nothing on you I care about." He was that direct because he had already spiritually resonated and knew that its techniques were only suitable for beasts. These blunt and crude words made the Fire Qilin Lion so enraged that it felt like one Buddha was born and two Buddhas ascended to heaven, almost exploding on the spot. Ultimately, Qin Ming "helped" it commit suicide, taking the large heart, which pulsed with crimson glow and fiery light, to extract the wondrous blood. Vaguely, within the crimson-glowing blood, a phantom image of a fire qilin, engulfed in raging flames, seemed to roar, truly terrifying and horrifying!

Near the majestic mountain, birds flapped their wings, flying into the distance. A gigantic white peacock hovered high in the sky. Upon hearing the report, it was instantly shocked, exclaiming in a lost voice, "He harvested all the wild 'wondrous medicines' discovered by the Ancestral Court's elders? No, even the roots were pulled out!"
