# Chapter 43: Thorough Preparations

"Five Immortal Masters, since night has fallen, why not rest at the county office? This humble official will dispatch all constables tomorrow to gather information for you. What do you say?"

Seeing Senior Brother Ding preparing to leave with Zhang Jing and the other three, the county magistrate hurriedly tried to persuade them to stay.

"That would be troublesome for you," Senior Brother Ding readily agreed.

"No trouble at all! Please wait a moment, Immortal Masters. This humble official will arrange a feast to welcome you."

"That won't be necessary. Just prepare five rooms for us."

"As you command, Immortal Masters."

The county magistrate immediately summoned his assistant and instructed, "Quickly arrange for the five guest rooms to be prepared."

Night fell.

In his room, Zhang Jing sat at a table, holding a spirit brush with complete concentration as he crafted talismans. The patterns on the talisman were drawn flawlessly as his spiritual sense steadily channeled spiritual energy into it.

Soon after, a faint glow flashed on the table.

A completed high-quality Star Guidance Talisman appeared before Zhang Jing, emitting a strong spiritual energy fluctuation before he stored it away along with his spirit brush, ink, and paper into his jade pendant space.

As his primary means of earning Dao merits currently, Zhang Jing didn't neglect talisman crafting even during missions, though he wasn't pushing himself to the limit as he did in his cave abode.

With a thought, his jade talisman slowly materialized:

[Ninefold Spirit Star Talisman Method - Level 2 (159/300)]
Skill Trait: Talisman Source Generation (Intermediate)

After over a month of relentless effort, Zhang Jing had successfully advanced his Ninefold Spirit Star Talisman Method to level two. In his Mind's Eye state, his success rate for crafting low-grade talismans had reached forty percent.

Moreover—

Zhang Jing gently extended his hand.

Instantly, a small, illusory talisman appeared in his palm—this was the incomplete source talisman of the Star Guidance Talisman. He estimated that crafting about eighty more Star Guidance Talismans would provide enough fragments to complete the source talisman.

At his current pace, that would take approximately twenty days.

Not long now.

Though by then, he'd face the headache of finding buyers.

Returning to the present, Zhang Jing sat cross-legged on his bed, took out a Purple Spirit Pill, and swallowed it. He quietly began circulating the Five Viscera Water Origin Scripture to rapidly enhance his cultivation.

The night deepened.

All was silent.

At some unknown time, an inexplicable white fog enveloped the entire Black Mountain County. The mist was so dense it seemed capable of trapping sound itself.

In one of the county office rooms...

Three figures huddled closely around a small table.

"Shen He has followed our instructions and separated the five Dao Academy cultivators. Should we make our move now?" a man with a black mole asked gravely.

"Can we avoid confrontation?" a burly man said hesitantly. "None of those Dao Academy disciples are easy targets! If we kill them, the academy might send late-stage Qi Refinement experts. Then not just us, but even Lord Yin wouldn't survive—we'd all perish!"

"We have no choice!" the elder among them suddenly interjected. "You saw their attitude today—they won't stop until they've turned Black Mountain County upside down. If Lord Yin is exposed, do you think we'll survive?"

"What about that mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator?"

"Judging by his aura today, he's likely at the fourth level of Qi Refinement, same as Lord Yin. Fortunately, Lord Yin gifted me a magic tool containing one of his full-power attacks. If we ambush him from the mist, we should be able to severely injure him."

"But first, we need to lure out those early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators and eliminate them one by one."

"Tsk tsk, do you think Lord Yin might reward us with some Spirit God Liquid if we succeed in killing these Dao Academy disciples? My cultivation hasn't improved in so long..."

Knock knock—

Zhang Jing was roused from his cultivation by knocking.

"Who is it?"

"Immortal Master, this lowly one is a constable from the county office. The magistrate sent me to report urgent news," a hushed voice called from outside.

The magistrate sending someone with urgent news in the middle of the night—to him alone?

A cold smile instantly appeared on Zhang Jing's face. Couldn't even wait a little longer?

He got out of bed and walked toward the door, his cyan robe faintly glowing.

Creak—

The door slowly opened.

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened as he saw an actual constable standing outside, his skin bearing the healthy glow of a living person, eyes bright and alert. His aura showed no abnormalities either.

Wait—when had such thick fog appeared outside?

"What's the matter?" Zhang Jing asked calmly.

"Immortal Master," the constable's face twisted into an expression of extreme fear upon seeing Zhang Jing, whispering, "Our magistrate says there are demons in Black Mountain County—right here in the county office! You must be careful!"

"Where are these demons?"

Zhang Jing scrutinized the man's eyes, only to see the reflection within grow larger and increasingly distorted.

"The demon is right before you, Immortal Master!" The constable's voice suddenly turned sinister.

Rip—

The sound of tearing fabric echoed as the constable's skin instantly faded to the color of dried parchment. Pale human hands emerged from his eyes, tearing the skin apart as a malevolent face squeezed through the gap.

The grotesque visage lunged at Zhang Jing's throat the moment it appeared.

Yet unexpectedly, faced with this horrifying sight, Zhang Jing found his mind eerily calm—likely because this thing posed no threat to him.

The Five Methods Spirit River quietly manifested. A spell-fish shimmering with icy blue light leaped from its surface, transforming into protective spiritual light around Zhang Jing.

[Frozen Light Curse - Level 5 (113/360)]
Skill Traits: Layered Light (Low-grade), Tenacity (Low-grade)

Thud—

The pale face slammed into Zhang Jing's protective light as if hitting an iron wall, its features contorting from the impact while the spiritual barrier didn't waver in the slightest.

"About first-level Qi Refinement in strength, but with impressive concealment abilities. I wouldn't have detected it if it hadn't torn its own skin," Zhang Jing mused, frowning slightly.

The first real demon he'd encountered had already given him a warning.

Shaking his head at the hideous face, Zhang Jing raised his right hand. His index finger passed through the Five Methods Spirit River as he lightly pointed forward.

A sharp glint appeared at his fingertip, carrying terrifying killing intent as it shot toward the demonic face.

[Frozen Blade Technique - Level 5 (87/360)]
Skill Traits: Sharpness (Low-grade), Killing Return (Low-grade)

Pop—

A bubble-bursting sound followed as the fleeing pale figure was cleaved in half, disintegrating into ash.

"More people?"

Following the demon's escape path, Zhang Jing spotted three faint figures in the white mist—the same three early-stage Qi Refinement rogue cultivators he'd seen at the county office earlier.

"Be extremely careful—absolutely must not let your guard down!"

Senior Brother Ding's warning echoed in his ears again.

Zhang Jing's spiritual sense swept through his jade pendant space, where dozens of talismans were neatly arranged. Within the Five Methods Spirit River, three dark jiao dragon-like spell-fish emitted violent auras while seven icy-blue spell-fish seemed eager to leap forth.

Seven layers of Frozen Light Curse, each enhanced by [Layered Light] and [Tenacity]—even Zhang Jing himself wasn't certain how formidable their combined defensive power was.

But he knew one thing for sure:

His Frozen Blade Technique, augmented by [Sharpness], [Killing Return], and the Dark Jiao Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme, had reached fourth-level Qi Refinement in power. Yet even three consecutive strikes couldn't breach seven layers of Frozen Light Curse.

His preparations were thorough. He hadn't been careless. He should be able to take on those three rogue cultivators alone.

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Jing's feet suddenly shimmered with watery light as he shot forward like an arrow, charging straight toward the three figures.
