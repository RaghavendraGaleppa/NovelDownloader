## Chapter Six: The Path of the Spirit Farmer

Liu Yun's expression was very serious: "Although for most people, they only need to cultivate one technique and diligently accumulate power. Once they break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, they can also become Outer Sect disciples and gain more cultivation resources."

"However, given the talent you've shown, Little Ding, you can completely manage two tasks at once, or even more. This is very rare, so you really should try cultivating all five elemental techniques. After becoming a Spirit Farmer, the sect's treatment is not much worse than that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and it also gives you an additional option."

"Furthermore, even if you can't become a Spirit Farmer, you can still cultivate one or two more techniques to handle more situations and earn more Spirit Rice in the spirit fields."

Old Huang and the others all nodded after hearing this.

"That's right! Little Ding, you have such talent, you mustn't waste it."

"Indeed, and those of us who only cultivate one technique have to wait until the annual harvest of the spirit fields to receive resources. It's too time-consuming."

"Senior Brother has now mastered three techniques and is almost at the second level of Qi Condensation. He's just been suppressing his cultivation to become a Spirit Farmer. In the Qi Condensation stage, Spirit Farmers are the best at earning resources, perhaps even more than Outer Sect disciples."

"Exactly, if you have this talent, you must give it a try. Even if it doesn't work out, there's no loss."

All the cultivators from building 377 urged him.

Upon hearing this, Ding Rui also nodded, feeling that Liu Yun's suggestion was worth considering.

He knew his own situation; his talent was definitely not bad.

And with the skill slots, he could inherently save a great deal of time in cultivation.

Because Liu Yun held multiple positions, his share of the Spirit Rice rewards from the sect after each quarterly harvest was also the largest.

After learning that Ding Rui could eliminate the large aphids, Old Huang took Ding Rui and marked out all the Spirit Rice plants he hadn't had time to deal with earlier.

These plants very likely contained large aphids and were originally destined to be discarded, but now all of them could be handed over to Ding Rui for treatment.

If all the Spirit Rice plants infested with large aphids could be cured, their harvest for this quarter would be significantly higher than before.

The number of Spirit Rice plants sown each quarter was fixed; one damaged plant meant one less.

And the main reason Spirit Rice plants were completely discarded was usually the large aphids.

After a few experiences, Ding Rui became more and more proficient at killing large aphids, quickly finishing the treatment of all large aphids in the entire spirit field.

Then, he joined Old Huang in killing regular aphids.

Aphids were inexhaustible.

Every Spirit Rice plant, if it had even one aphid, also contained several aphid eggs.

Those eggs were too small and too hidden for cultivators to find; they could only be dealt with after they hatched and grew a bit larger.

However, the killed aphids would become pure nutrients absorbed by the Spirit Rice plants from within.

So, if handled properly, there would be no loss.

In just one morning, Ding Rui had already finished treating the Spirit Rice plants he was responsible for de-worming.

In reality, simply sitting in meditation to cultivate wasn't very effective; otherwise, they wouldn't need to cultivate Spirit Rice.

Only by consuming Spirit Rice could one cultivate efficiently; absorbing spiritual energy from heaven and earth was simply too slow.

And consuming Spirit Rice required refining it, which was time-consuming, so they only did it when they had ample time.

"Actually, cultivating the *Raindrop Technique* isn't too difficult. Like the *Golden Radiance Technique*, it's very simple. Once you know which meridians to use, locate the kidney's position, and where True Essence is stored, then just like cultivating the *Golden Radiance Technique*, you control the attribute-less True Essence to transform into *Raindrop Technique* True Essence."

"The real difficulty, however, lies in genuinely doing two things at once!"

Liu Yun became serious and asked, "Do you know why most people only cultivate one Five Elements technique?"

"No," Ding Rui shook his head honestly.

In the past two years, besides learning some basic things, he had spent every day doing manual labor and cultivating the *Golden Radiance Technique*. He hadn't bothered with such matters.
