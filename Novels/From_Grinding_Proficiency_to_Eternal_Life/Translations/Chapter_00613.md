# Chapter 613: Unyielding and Unreturning

Xu Yunfan stood upon the tumultuous Eastern Sea, the surface beneath his feet condensed into a mirror by his immense magical power.

The Zhoutian Spirit Banner crackled, its dark fabric adorned with three hundred and sixty-five stars that flickered and flowed, descending infinite starlight to grind away at the煌煌 sword shadow at its core.

This was Ye Yuan, an elder of the Tianji Peak of the Wansheng Sword Sect.

Seeing the opponent sustain his first injury, Xu Yunfan secretly let out a breath of relief.

He had truly thought this man was invincible.

If he had been forced to use the Golden Core Sword Intent left to him by Patriarch Pure Yang, that would have been a great loss of face; that was a trump card he was saving for his Golden Core ascension.

Soon, Xu Yunfan sensed the subtle changes and turbulent fluctuations in Ye Yuan's aura beneath the heavy suppression—the surging fury of a desperate situation.

But then, the violent aura on Ye Yuan's body strangely calmed down, like the silence before a volcano erupts.

In the eye of the storm, his face returned to a terrifying calm.

His gaze pierced through the layers of starlight and banner shadows, locking onto Xu Yunfan. His voice was cold and hard, clearly penetrating the space amidst the roar of sword energy and thunder, echoing by Xu Yunfan's ears.

"Xu Yunfan, I know you. Peak Master of the Divine Thunder Peak of the Primordial Origin Sect, considered one of the more outstanding Foundation Establishment cultivators of your sect in recent years."

"I have wielded this sword to slay demons and evil for over three hundred years since Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment. After three lifetimes of reincarnation, it has been thirty-seven years since I attained the perfected Foundation Establishment realm. Yet, this is the first time I have been pushed to such a的地步."

The words were plain, yet they contained a suffocating killing intent.

While speaking, he was simultaneously gathering his momentum.

Xu Yunfan's heart tightened slightly. This man was trapped in a great array, having consumed vast amounts of magical power, yet his aura remained as deep and stable as an abyss.

Ye Yuan's gaze swept over Xu Yunfan like an invisible sword edge.

"You, at merely late-stage Foundation Establishment, have managed to achieve such a feat. Truly not bad."

His voice paused, carrying a condescending tone of evaluation. "Much better than that Lu Chuan who fled at the critical moment, a man of despicable character."

Hearing Ye Yuan mention Lu Chuan's lack of loyalty, Xu Yunfan felt a surge of nameless anger in his heart.

These dogs of the Primordial Origin Sect; none of them have any principles when out in the world.

They run at the first sign of trouble.

Of course, if Ye Yuan hadn't targeted him, Xu Yunfan would naturally have fled as well.

Unfortunately, he had laid down the great array, which truly drew a lot of hatred, forcing him to find a way to defend himself.

Xu Yunfan cursed furiously in his heart, but only a faint sneer appeared on his face. The True Martial Sword pointed diagonally at the sea surface, purple arcs of electricity jumping erratically along the blade.

He was just about to speak.

*Swish!*

A cold light flashed abruptly!

Ye Yuan's words shifted sharply, his action faster than his speech.

只见 he raised his wrist, not pointing at his opponent, but gazing at the iron sword in his hand—plain and unadorned, covered in cracks, yet containing a tragic aura—as if looking at a lifelong friend and the path of his Dao.

"This sword..."

His voice lowered, carrying a tone of near reverence.

"Is named 'Hui Gang'. Since I received this crude iron sword胚 from the Wansheng Sword Sect as a confused Qi Condensation child, I have nourished it with my heart's blood day and night, tempered its edge with my will. It accompanied me to Foundation Establishment, slaying demons and eliminating evil. The hardships of my centuries-long Dao path, cutting through karma to protect the Dao, are all contained within this."

He gripped the hilt tightly. The Hui Gang Sword, possessing a spirit of its own, hummed as its mottled cracks glowed, emitting a low sword tone. It seemed to silently recount countless life-and-death battles. The sword's body vibrated, not with a mournful cry, but a dragon's roar thirsting for battle.

An indescribable sorrow and tragic will spread out, causing even the starlight grinding power descended by the Zhoutian Constellation Array to stagnate for a moment.

"Xu Yunfan."

Ye Yuan's voice suddenly rose, like the clash of metal, tearing through the sky. His gaze pierced through the chains of starlight, burning with intensity.

"Today, to die beneath this sword of mine is worthy of your late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation and my respect."

"Enough qualification!"

The moment the word "qualification" exploded, the long-gathering anomaly erupted violently.

There was no warning.

*Hum!*

A sword chant that shook the Eastern Sea rose from the iron sword named Hui Gang. It was not the trembling sound of metal, but more like a resonance with the principles of heaven and earth.

An indescribable pressure, a tragic will of abandoning the body for no survival, advancing without retreat, severing all shackles and the future, condensed abruptly.

Behind Ye Yuan, the void twisted and shattered violently.

Endless pale light, like a supernova explosion, swept out instantly, devouring the starlight behind it, devouring the banner spirits and soul shadows, devouring the waves and sea breeze.

That space transformed into a pure, incredibly tragic, and unyielding sword domain possessing a trace of indestructible golden nature.

This was the phenomenon manifested when a Foundation Establishment perfected cultivator comprehends their own Dao.

The Pure White Absolute Domain · Hui Gang Nirvana!

Xu Yunfan's heart shook violently.

The next moment, his innate talent, the Martial Dao Heavenly Eye, opened. Divine light instinctively operated frantically, attempting to analyze the scene before him.

These were not merely streams of pure energy.

They were the manifestation of Ye Yuan's lifelong cultivation will.

The ultimate manifestation of his extremely unyielding, self-sacrificing sword Dao.

It was a summary of his entire cultivation and understanding of the sword Dao, and even his inquiry into the Dao of Golden Nature Immortality.

The appearance of this phenomenon meant only one thing.

Ye Yuan's understanding of the Dao Fruit he sought had reached a critical point. He might have already touched that supreme sword Dao Fruit on a spiritual level and gained its favor.

He simply had not yet used himself as an anchor to completely summon it into the present world.

That Fruit, corresponding to Ye Yuan's unyielding sword intent and the heritage of the Wansheng Sword Sect, should be one controlled by the Wansheng Sword Sect.

"Sunless Unreturning Wansheng Dao Fruit!"

The thought flashed through Xu Yunfan's mind, and all the hair on his body stood on end.

This was no longer the power of a mere perfected Foundation Establishment. This was the might possessed by someone who had half a foot on the threshold of the Golden Core, about to seek the Golden Core and prove the Dao.

It had long surpassed that of an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"Die!"

Ye Yuan's face, illuminated by the light of the Pure White Absolute Domain, showed a madness and determination akin to burning the jade and stone together.

He raised the Hui Gang Sword high with both hands. Under the加持 of the phenomenon, the sword seemed to transform into the sole light source in the heavens and earth, carrying the power of the entire Pure White Absolute Domain.

There was no need to summon the might of the Big Dipper's Yaoguang Star. This sword burned his own foundation and will, a pure sword intent of unyieldingness sublimated to the extreme.

"Cut!!!"

The Hui Gang Sword fell silently. There was no grand momentum, only a thread of white-gold light condensed to the extreme, as fine as a hair yet seeming capable of slicing through the river of time.

Advancing without retreat!

Cutting through all Dharmas!

This thread ignored the distance of space, ignored the grinding starlight of the three hundred and sixty-five stars of the Zhoutian Constellation Array descending, enough to crush mountains.

The vast energy of the array, upon touching the white line, was like a fragile screen torn by an invisible hand, leaving a narrow yet irreparable gap.

The grinding power of the starlight seemed to meet a natural enemy before it, crumbling and annihilating one after another.

The Chengtian Sword Seat's sword energy attempted to block it and was instantly shattered.

The chains of demonic煞气 were silently severed.

The life-for-life sword light stabbed out by Ye Kai's soul body, upon approaching this white line, disintegrated on its own like a moth drawn to a flame.
