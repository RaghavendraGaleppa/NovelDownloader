# Chapter 396: Kai Mai Dan

He glanced meaningfully at several graceful figures in the distance. "If you're willing to take on some 'special assignments,' contribution points will naturally roll in."

"Thank you for the reminder, Elder."

Xu Yunfan understood the implication and gave a knowing smile that only men would understand. He accepted the essential cultivation manual of the Hundred Desires Peak that the Elder casually handed over, then cupped his fists in farewell.

The Elder watched Xu Yunfan's muscular retreating figure and couldn't help but sigh in admiration. "His pure Yang energy must be incredibly potent! If one were to extract and refine it, their cultivation would surely advance by leaps and bounds!"

"..."

Following the map in the package, he found his assigned residence.

It was a tiled house on the mountainside, plus a small courtyard. The courtyard was only about three meters square, and the tiled house contained nothing but a stone bed and a meditation cushion.

But even in such a humble dwelling, the concentration of spiritual energy was more than ten times that of the Divine Martial Realm!

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath and sat cross-legged on the cushion, beginning to inspect his gains from the day.

He took out the jade slip containing the "Hundred Skeletons Piercing Nether Technique" obtained from Xu Tian's storage bag and pressed it to his forehead.

His divine sense penetrated it, and the complete contents of the technique immediately flooded his mind.

"So that's how it is..."

A moment later, Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, a sharp light flashing within them. He had filled in the intentional flaws and key points left behind by Youquan and Xu Tian, and his previous doubts were suddenly cleared.

"Using Kai Mai Dan as a guide, at the intersection of flesh and blood—specifically three inches below the navel, where the Qihai Dantian is located—one cultivates a Dantian-like organ. This is like a great tree growing roots that spread throughout the entire body, reshaping the meridian system and allowing the physical body to adapt to the operation of the True武 Devouring Demon Scripture."

His current situation was very delicate. On one hand, he had successfully infiltrated the Primordial Origin Sect and obtained a legitimate identity. On the other hand, without Kai Mai Dan, he couldn't truly cultivate the True武 Devouring Demon Scripture.

He couldn't even cultivate the Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Great Law that was essential for disciples of the Hundred Desires Peak.

He had already looked over this profound technique.

It uses desires as fuel, transforms sexual intercourse into a cauldron, and seizes the Yin-Yang creation of heaven and earth.

When men cultivate it, they extract Yin to supplement Yang; when women cultivate it, they extract Yang to supplement Yin, ultimately achieving mutual Yin-Yang supplementation.

"I need to find a way to get Kai Mai Dan..."

This was the top priority. Fortunately, he had over a dozen spatial bags on him, all obtained from the Primordial Origin Sect disciples in the Divine Martial Realm.

Although most of these people were burdened with debt, they still had quite a few things hidden on their persons. When summed up, the materials were quite considerable—at least, in Xu Yunfan's current view, enough for him to do many things.

Xu Yunfan didn't delay. He immediately took out the "Disciple Introduction Manual" issued by the Primordial Origin Sect, flipped to the sect map on the last page, and fixed his gaze on the "Joy Courtyard" mark in the northeast corner of the Hundred Desires Peak.

Passing through winding mountain paths, he was surrounded by pavilions and towers with carved beams and painted rafters. The air was filled with a sweet, cloying scent of cosmetics.

From time to time, Hundred Desires Peak disciples in light gauze robes brushed past him. Their eyes rippled as they observed Xu Yunfan's robust physique and vigorous vital energy, regardless of gender, many stopping to watch.

Some disciples even wanted to step forward and strike up a conversation.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. His steps shifted slightly, his figure moving with uncanny agility, and he disappeared before the eyes of the crowd in an instant.

The disciples looked at each other, inwardly understanding that the newcomer's strength was at least at the late stage of Qi Condensation to possess such presence.

Joy Courtyard was located on a platform halfway up the mountain. A plaque hung before the vermilion gates inscribed with "Sea of Desires Has No Bounds," making the corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth twitch involuntarily.

As Xu Yunfan stepped into the hall, the extravagant atmosphere assaulting him made him frown slightly.

On the left side, crystal display cases held various dual-cultivation artifacts. There were Huanhuan Bells covered in runes, Immortal-Binding Ropes woven from flood dragon tendons, and even double-headed dragons soaking in spiritual liquid...

The right side was packed with disciples queuing for loans, pressing their identity jade plaques into the mouths of bronze toads. With every contribution point deducted, the toad's eyes would flash with a crimson light.

Xu Yunfan walked straight to the central green jade counter and tapped the surface three times with his fingertip.

Behind the counter, an Elder disciple was lazily reclining on a soft couch. Beside him, two female cultivators—one massaging his shoulders, the other holding a crystal cup to feed him amber-colored spiritual wine.

"New here?"

The Elder squinted as he sized up Xu Yunfan, his gaze lingering for a moment on his robust physique. "Exchange or loan? If it's a loan, we need to verify your pure Yang first."

"I'm here to exchange materials. I want to exchange for Kai Mai Dan," Xu Yunfan replied.

The Elder disciple raised an eyebrow, looking him up and down, and immediately understood. He said with a half-smile, "One thousand points. No bargaining."

Xu Yunfan's expression didn't change. From Xu Tian, he knew the price of Kai Mai Dan.

For such niche and obscure pills, the price fluctuation wasn't very large. Many disciples who speculated on materials wouldn't choose this item, so the price had remained exceptionally stable from beginning to end.

"Kai Mai Dan is such a niche pill; its price has always been stable," the Elder disciple said lazily as he flipped through the jade register of materials. A faint light flickered on the register as the contents jumped, the green jade counter reflecting his casual expression.

"Unlike those popular pills. If Dust Peak buys them all up today, the price soars by thirty percent. If Hundred Herbs Peak releases stock tomorrow, it crashes by half."

He tapped a dusty page on the ledger with his finger. "In the past three years, only seventy-three have been exchanged in total. The price has always been anchored at one thousand contribution points."

He then suddenly gave a sneering laugh. "The year before last, those lunatics from White岳 Peak wanted to hoard goods to drive up the price, but ended up stuck with them for three years without being able to offload them. Who would use this thing besides those cultivating the Hundred Skeletons Piercing Nether Technique?"

The Elder disciple narrowed his eyes slightly, his gaze sweeping back and forth over Xu Yunfan, a meaningful smile curling at the corner of his mouth. "You look unfamiliar, Junior Brother. A newly entered disciple?"

He tapped the green jade counter lightly with his fingertips, making a crisp sound. "A niche pill like Kai Mai Dan, ordinary disciples wouldn't exchange it so casually..."

Xu Yunfan's expression remained calm. The Ten Extremities True Qi within him circulated quietly, the pores on his body slightly opening. A faint, oppressive aura rippled outward.

The Elder disciple's originally frivolous expression suddenly froze. The jade register he was playing with fell onto the counter with a "snap."

"What vigorous vital energy! At least comparable to a direct disciple in the late stage of Qi Condensation!"

The Elder was secretly shocked, cold sweat breaking out on his back.

He only now noticed that this seemingly ordinary disciple before him, with each breath, actually drew the surrounding spiritual energy into a subtle vortex. The muscle lines faintly visible beneath his robes were like dormant pythons.

Xu Yunfan spoke slowly, his voice low and steady. "You jest, Senior Brother. I've just entered the sect and only wish to find a suitable cultivation technique."

He tapped the counter lightly with his fingertip, a dark golden true qi flowing and vanishing beneath his skin. "Is there anything particular about Kai Mai Dan?"

Although true qi was not as refined as true essence, the sheer volume of Xu Yunfan's hidden true qi was as deep as an abyss, making the Elder disciple's Adam's apple bob as he discreetly wiped his forehead. With this level of true qi, he could crush him just by sheer quantity.
