# Chapter 357: After Dozens of Steps, the View Suddenly Opens Up to the Vast Phenomena Immortal Sect!

In the peach blossom forest, Li Mo, utilizing the Seventy-Two Transformations, walked out unhurriedly. He had assumed the form of Bai Ze, wearing pure yang robes, with deer antlers atop his head.

Around his neck was a ring of fine fluff, and his clear gaze seemed to pierce right through one's heart.

Hands clasped behind his back, he stepped upon azure waves. His white robes fluttered, his demeanor elegant and amiable, quiet and indifferent.

This stood in stark contrast to the Holy Maiden of the Vast Phenomena Immortal Sect.

Li Mo smiled at the members of the Summoning Demon Cult.

"Are you all looking for me?"

The leading actor and actress of the Qingyuan Sect were putting on a performance on the same stage! (The Ice Cube wasn't acting.)

And they were playing the classic "good cop, bad cop" routine! First, the unfathomable, icy-cold Holy Maiden of the Vast Phenomena Immortal Sect took the vanguard, applying immense pressure to the opponents.

Then, the understanding junior brother stepped in to relieve the pressure. With this combination, anyone who came would be left bewildered.

Luo Yexian glanced at the withered middle-aged man beside him, who nodded.

The direction from which the power of all living beings converged was indeed toward the youth before them.

He looked at Ying Bing with alarm. Just a glance from that woman made him feel as if he had needles on his back. He had a feeling that if he uttered a single word of refusal, he would likely be decapitated...

"That is correct," Luo Yexian said, his eyes flickering as he nodded.

After all, the higher-ups had instructed him to probe first. Not knowing the depth of the opponent, he dared not tear relations apart recklessly.

Only then did the Vast Phenomena Holy Maiden withdraw her gaze.

A small boat drifted along with the water currents, flowing downstream.

Only after she temporarily left did the members of the Summoning Demon Cult let out a sigh of relief.

"You knew we were coming?" Luo Yexian reacted now.

The fact that the other party came out specifically to greet them meant they had anticipated their visit!

Li Mo stood casually, as if defenseless, nodding with a smile.

"If I hadn't wanted to see you, how could you have found me?"

*Gasp...*

Hearing the implication in his words, it seemed he knew they were coming and deliberately leaked his aura?

They had thought they were tracking him!

"Luo Yexian, Hall Master of the Summoning Demon Cult, relative of the Summoning Demon Saint Son, Sixth Stage of the External Scene Realm. Unfortunately, your innate talent is limited. You've been desperately seeking the opportunity for a Divine Body but have never obtained it. Is that correct?"

Luo Yexian: "!!"

How did he know?!

Li Mo continued with a light laugh, "And your mahjong etiquette is terrible."

"!!!!?"

Luo Yexian was terrified.

The members of the Summoning Demon Cult exchanged glances, their expressions solemn.

How did he even know *that*?

For a moment, looking at this youth again, they inexplicably felt he was even more profound and unfathomable!

The fact that he knew they were coming, or even that he deliberately guided them to meet, was likely true as well.

If he harbored ill intentions, he only needed to lay an ambush here...

The more they thought about it, the more alarmed they became.

Even their original intent to question him aggressively had faded significantly.

At this moment, Li Mo took the initiative to invite them. "You have come from afar, so you are guests. If you don't mind, why don't you follow me into the sect?"

With that, he turned and walked deep into the peach blossom forest, as if knowing for sure that they would follow.

Luo Yexian's expression changed. After exchanging glances with the high priests of the Summoning Demon Cult, he nodded.

They left a few people to wait at the spot, while the rest followed Li Mo's figure ahead.

"I've been here before. There was no Immortal Sect here in the past," a member of the Summoning Demon Cult said, his eyes filled with suspicion.

Luo Yexian narrowed his eyes and asked, "May I ask why you waited here specifically?"

"Naturally, to lead you all to the root, to find your origins."

"Our Summoning Demon Cult has an ancient history and a long lineage. How could it be that we established our sect by learning the inheritance of some Immortal Sect?"

Although he couldn't see through the person before him, Luo Yexian still couldn't believe this.

---

These Summoning Demon Cultists were all veterans of the old cult.

Their Holy Cult was no simple matter. Not only was it influential in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, but according to their teachings, the various deities they worshipped were all beings who had truly ascended to the Upper Realm!

They were true immortals!

Even the Great Yu Dynasty, which ruled the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, wouldn't dare claim a more prestigious background than theirs.

But Li Mo just smiled, not arguing, exuding a natural, calm demeanor that made him hard to fathom.

"Then consider it a tour to broaden your horizons."

"We have arrived at the mountain gate."

"?"

Li Mo stopped. It was a very narrow crack in the mountain wall, barely wide enough for one person to pass through.

The mountain gate of the Vast Phenomena Immortal Sect... was this?

Calling it a mountain ditch would be a compliment. Even a small sect in the wilderness wouldn't use this as a mountain gate.

"I knew it. I remember there was no Vast Phenomena Immortal Sect here," the priest who had been here before spoke again.

"Now that we are here, it exists."

Li Mo walked into the mountain wall, his voice echoing back.

"If my Master wished it, the entire world could be the Vast Phenomena Immortal Sect. If you lack the affinity to come here next time, you won't be able to enter."

A certain monk from the Void Monastery felt a strong sense of *déjà vu*.

Isn't that his line?

You really are the expert at showing off, Li Mo. With a slight modification, the style instantly becomes higher.

"At first, it was extremely narrow, just enough for a person to pass. After walking dozens of steps, it suddenly opened up."

Just as Li Mo said!

As they walked, the mountain wall suddenly widened.

Ahead!

There was light!

The members of the Summoning Demon Cult couldn't help but stop in their tracks, stunned.

In the distance, white clouds stretched far away, green mountains were distant. Pavilions and towers were scattered like stars, carved beams and painted rafters were arranged in an orderly fashion. Bridges of rainbows connected the pavilions, resting upon the white clouds!

There were miraculous beasts swallowing clouds and breathing mist, and powerful beings of unfathomable realm dancing with thunder in mid-air!

What would it feel like to bring the scenes from a world of immortals and heroes into a martial world like the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands?

The Summoning Demon Cultists were completely dumbfounded!

Everything before them was violently impacting their imagination!

Li Mo turned around and bowed again. "Please, everyone, suppress your cultivation to the Divine Observation Realm."

"Why?"

Li Mo's eyes were profound. "The higher your realm, the more you can sense. There are some things it is better for you all not to touch too early."

"This..."

Luo Yexian truly hesitated. If he hadn't seen the miraculous scene before him, he would have refused immediately.

But an immortal realm was right before his eyes...

He couldn't help but look up at the figure bathing in lightning amidst the thunder in the sky.

"Oh, that is one of my junior brothers. He was born with a Thunder Body and must bathe in Heavenly Tribulation every day."

"!!!"

Bathing in Heavenly Tribulation?

What terrifying realm would be required to do such a thing?

And such an existence was merely this youth's junior brother?

But this youth is clearly at the Divine Observation Realm... No, does that mean even the disciples of the Vast Phenomena Immortal Sect themselves must suppress their cultivation to return to the sect?

What exactly is hidden within this sect...

Remembering the instructions from the Summoning Demon Saint Son, Luo Yexian finally nodded.

Li Mo let out a silent sigh of relief.

Those with higher cultivation than him simply couldn't enter...

But as long as they entered, the next steps would be much easier.

After all.

This was his world!

The one配合ing his performance next was an entire world!
