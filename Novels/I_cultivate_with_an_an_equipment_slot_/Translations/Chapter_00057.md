# Chapter 57: Trading Fair

The Great Competition hosted by the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace would last for over half a month. During this period, several auctions and trading fairs would be held—this was what Zhuge Wan had previously told him.

"I need to scour these events thoroughly for spirit artifacts and magical instruments," Zhang Yan thought to himself. He still had a considerable amount of spirit stones on him, and since they were of no use just sitting idle, he might as well exchange them for items that could benefit him—such as magical instruments or spirit artifacts. He was quite excited about these prospects, as the competition had gathered many cultivation sects from the Zhao Kingdom, and he expected to find plenty of desirable items.

The next day, Zhang Yan sought out Zhuge Wan early in the morning.

"You want to attend the auction?" she asked.

"Yes, Master. I’d like to broaden my horizons," Zhang Yan replied with a respectful bow.

"Very well. But be cautious—the competition begins in three days," Zhuge Wan said after a moment’s consideration. She didn’t stop him, as they were already within the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace’s territory, and few would dare cause trouble under the watch of a Nascent Soul elder. Besides, Zhang Yan had a steady temperament and wasn’t the type to stir up trouble.

"Thank you, Master," Zhang Yan said and prepared to leave.

"Wait—do you have enough spirit stones?" Zhuge Wan asked.

"Rest assured, Master. I have sufficient funds." 

He still had the decade’s worth of spirit stones he had received earlier, untouched until now. Using them to purchase equipment was the perfect opportunity.

The auction venue was easy to find—located in the central market of the open area designated by the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace. The reason the palace hosted the Great Competition and offered generous rewards was simple: profit. The real gains came from the bustling market and auctions during the event. Over the three-month competition, the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace reaped enormous profits, which had naturally drawn complaints. 

In response, the palace proposed a rule: whichever sect’s disciple secured first place in the competition would host the next event. However, despite the competition being held for centuries, no other sect had ever claimed the top spot—largely due to the unique spell, "Flower Grafting."

After leaving his quarters, Zhang Yan equipped the Veiled Mask. A faint ripple of energy concealed his aura completely. With an additional bamboo hat, his presence was thoroughly hidden.

Entering the market, his eyes lit up. The variety of goods here far surpassed that of Qingheng Market—several times over, in fact.

This made sense, of course. The Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace relied on this market for profit, so they had to offer genuine treasures to entice buyers. Zhang Yan browsed carefully and managed to acquire several valuable items.

One such find was a second-hand talisman brush. Its previous owner had clearly used it for a long time—the intricate carvings on the shaft were worn smooth, and the bristles had thinned considerably. Yet, precisely because of this, the brush had developed inscriptions related to talisman crafting.

**[Equipment Name]:** Wolf-Hair Brush  
**[Equipment Tier]:** Mid-Grade Magical Instrument  
**[Equipment Quality]:** Green  
**[Equipment Effects]:** Basic Talisman Crafting (Mastered), Swiftwind Talisman (Proficient), Fireball Talisman (Mastered)  

This brush granted Zhang Yan the knowledge to craft two types of talismans, one of which was already at a mastered level. This meant his success rate for Fireball Talismans would be around sixty percent. If he switched professions, he could immediately start earning as a talisman master—though the profits would be meager. Fireball Talismans were low-tier, and a dozen would only yield a handful of spirit stones. The effort hardly seemed worth it compared to the comfort of being a landlord.

Still, he purchased the brush. Whether he used it was one thing, but having the skill was another. He might disdain the paltry earnings from crafting Fireball Talismans, but he couldn’t afford not to know how to make them.

Pleased with his acquisition, Zhang Yan turned his attention to the trading fair. If the market had such treasures, the fair would surely offer even more. Unlike the auction, which catered to Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators—where his ten thousand spirit stones might not secure anything significant—the trading fair was ideal. Most participants were less affluent, trading their used magical instruments, which often carried multiple inscriptions. 

Zhang Yan preferred practicality over prestige—he didn’t need the most expensive items, just the right ones.

Finding the trading fair was simple. Organized by the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace, one only needed to pay a small fee to gain entry. Zhang Yan handed over twenty spirit stones to a guide, who eagerly led him to a lively gathering.

The setup was intriguing. Participants sat in a circle on meditation cushions, with a small platform at the center. Each took turns stepping up, presenting their items, and stating their desired trades. If no suitable offers were made, spirit stones or other negotiations could be discussed.

When Zhang Yan arrived, a female cultivator stood at the center, clad in a black robe that obscured her features. 

"I have three spirit fruits that enhance cultivation and break through bottlenecks. I wish to trade for a mid-grade magical instrument," she announced. Though her voice suggested youth, her identity remained hidden.

The fruits didn’t interest Zhang Yan, but for ordinary cultivators, they were valuable—especially for their breakthrough properties.

"I have a mid-grade magical instrument—the Bone-Corroding Needle, excellent for ambushes," one participant offered.

"Here’s a mid-grade Earth-Turning Seal, though its power is modest," another added.

Both were decent options. The woman eventually chose the seal, compensating the difference with additional spirit stones.

Taking his seat on a cushion, Zhang Yan waited for the next item.

"This humble Daoist has brought a stalk of Ten-Thousand-Year Bamboo. Would any fellow Daoists be interested?"

"Ten-Thousand-Year Bamboo?" 

Zhang Yan’s eyes gleamed. After searching for so long, he had finally found it!
