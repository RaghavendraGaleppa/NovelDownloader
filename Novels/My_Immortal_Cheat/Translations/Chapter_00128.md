# Chapter 128: Journey to the Zhou Family

"Oh?" The Holy Demon looked at Zhou Tian in surprise. To completely wipe the slate clean of all grievances was no simple promise.

After he had attacked Zhou Tian, the matter was no longer just about Zhou Tian himself; it had become the Holy Demon's provocation against the Zhou family. For a major power like the Zhou family, face was paramount. Their pursuit of the Holy Demon was not just for revenge on Zhou Tian, but also to assert their own authority. To settle everything wouldn't be as simple as a single word from Zhou Tian.

"If you can truly achieve that, then perhaps it's possible," the Holy Demon replied after a moment of thought. It was still the same principle: no one wanted to die if they could live. He had offended the Zhou family for his own goals, and it was out of necessity. Having been trapped in the Heavenly King realm for countless years, he was on the verge of madness. The Zhou family was currently preoccupied with certain matters, unable to spare their top combatants. But once they were free, if he hadn't reached the Dao Master realm by then, he would surely die. Even if he reached the Dao Master realm, he would only barely manage to escape with his life. While the Zhou family certainly wouldn't send a Heavenly Venerate to pursue him, two Dao Masters were not something he could afford to provoke. If this matter could truly be settled, that would be for the best.

"As long as you release the two of them, our grievances will be over. I'll explain things to the family," Zhou Tian guaranteed.

The Holy Demon chuckled, shaking his head. "I've lived for countless years; what kind of trick haven't I seen? Even a heart demon blood oath sworn upon one's own Dao Heart can be circumvented, let alone relying on a mere promise from you."

"Then what do you want?" Zhou Tian asked.

"I want you to come with me to your Zhou family's stronghold. I want to become one of your Zhou family's guest retainers."

Zhou Tian looked at the Holy Demon in astonishment. Become a guest retainer of the Zhou family? This Holy Demon's way of thinking was truly unconventional. He had some understanding of the term "guest retainer." The Heavenly Qin faction was merely the Zhou family's designation in Funtian Prefecture, for administrative convenience. In the Star Realm, they were still referred to as the Zhou family, and Heavenly Qin's officials existed as their subsidiary families, linked by the Heavenly Qin tie. In the Star Realm, numerous forces stood tall, and no single power could dominate. Alliances and strategies were crucial. Guest retainers existed to recruit lone experts. One side needed influence, the other needed combat power. It wasn't uncommon for many to actively seek to join major forces as guest retainers, but what kind of bizarre idea was this from the Holy Demon? If you can't beat them, join them?

"Didn't you make a deal with someone else to attack me? Now you want to be a guest retainer of my Zhou family. What about your deal with that person?" Zhou Tian was a little perplexed.

"He didn't say I couldn't join you. You don't need to worry about me. There's an oath between me and that person, and I will naturally fulfill what I'm supposed to do, but he can't control my actions," the Holy Demon explained.

"Didn't you say..."

"I have seen ways to escape oaths. Suicide can evade a Dao Heart blood oath, but he certainly wouldn't do that," the Holy Demon said with a calm smile, implying these were minor details.

Zhou Tian: "............"

"Alright then, but once you become a guest retainer, you can no longer be an enemy of my Zhou family. Otherwise, you know the price." If one were merely an ordinary person who offended the Zhou family, it wouldn't be too bad; the Zhou family would pursue them but wouldn't expend too much effort. But if a guest retainer betrayed them, they would be finished. No one could withstand a Heavenly Venerate-level pursuit; that was the rule.

Zhou Tian felt a strange sensation. How had he suddenly recruited a formidable combatant for his family, especially when this person had just tried to kill him?

"I naturally know. You just need to cooperate with me." Normally, the Holy Demon wouldn't have such an idea. He had even prepared himself for a life on the run. Even if he had someone backing him, they couldn't openly protect him. Who knew he would suddenly encounter Zhou Tian, giving the situation a turning point? Otherwise, if he had just shown up at the Zhou family's doorstep, declaring his desire to be a guest retainer, he'd probably get his head beaten in.

"Alright then, in that case, let's go back. I haven't been back in a long time. Do you know where my Zhou family's stronghold in the Forsaken Land is?" Zhou Tian nodded. The Zhou family's stronghold was his home ground; how could he object to the Holy Demon actively requesting to go there?

"I naturally know. To display their so-called might, I can clearly feel that powerful aura even from here," the Holy Demon said with an inexplicable tone.

*Fine, you're strong, you're powerful,* Zhou Tian thought, unsure what to say.

With a wave of his hand, the Holy Demon sent Ling Yu and Mu Su, who had felt reborn, to some unknown location. "Just a small protective measure. If all goes well, your two friends will reappear unharmed, perhaps even slightly stronger. If not, then I apologize." The Holy Demon spoke before Zhou Tian could even open his mouth.

Zhou Tian had nothing to say and could only secretly grumble about how cautious this old fellow was.

The Holy Demon pointed into the void, and golden ripples spread out. A resonant cry echoed through the four fields. A colossal divine bird suddenly appeared in the void. It had a head like a phoenix and the roar of a dragon, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky, and its tail comprised nine lustrous feathers of varying colors. Its claws were sharp enough to tear space.

"Let's go," the Holy Demon said calmly. Before Zhou Tian could react, space shifted, and when they reappeared, they were already inside a magnificent palace.

"This is inside Phoenix Plume's belly. The distance isn't short; it will take another two or three days. Wait here," the Holy Demon said to Zhou Tian, sitting on a central chair in the resplendent, luxurious palace, built from rare materials.

Zhou Tian nodded and found a chair to sit on, diagonally in front of the Holy Demon. The Holy Demon closed his eyes and began to cultivate, forming profound hand seals. Behind him, a Buddha appeared, seated on a glazed golden lotus, with fingers pinching a flower, eyes slightly closed.

This made Zhou Tian curious. What cultivation method did this Holy Demon practice that caused a Buddha phenomenon to appear? After a while, however, the radiant golden Buddha turned black, and even the golden lotus it sat on became black, devoid of compassion, instead exuding the aura of a great demon. The illusory figure behind the Holy Demon continuously shifted between these two states, an enigmatic aura reverberating throughout the place.

"Uh..." Zhou Tian uttered a sound. The Holy Demon opened his eyes, a momentary wildness in their depths that vanished just as quickly.

"Are you related to Luo Tian Temple?" Zhou Tian asked. Now that he and the Holy Demon were in a cooperative arrangement, with both having needs, he no longer felt the need to be overly cautious around the Holy Demon.

"Didn't your father tell you?" The Holy Demon closed his eyes again, and the Buddha reappeared behind him. This was not his primary cultivation method, but rather a special nurturing technique that didn't require his full concentration.
