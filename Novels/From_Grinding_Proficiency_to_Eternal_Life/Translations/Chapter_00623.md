# Chapter 623: A New World

After all, it was not a Numinous Treasure, and facing such terrifying mystic light, it was still somewhat lacking.

The fact that it could break through realms and travel within them already signified that Xu Yunfan had reached a pinnacle of refinement in the art of artifact crafting.

It was unclear how much time had passed; it might have been an instant or perhaps a long, agonizing period. The Void-Crossing Boat suddenly trembled, passing through an invisible barrier.

The scene before them suddenly opened up, completely different.

A thick, rich scent of vegetation rushed toward them, carrying a wild, primal vitality.

Sunlight filtered through the gaps in the leaves and branches of towering ancient trees, forming mottled pillars of light.

The energy here was extremely abundant, but it was not the pure and gentle spiritual qi of the Taihua Lingxu Realm. Instead, it carried a rough, primitive, and even somewhat violent nature. The energy of various attributes was mixed and difficult to tame.

"Pfft!"

Just as he let out a breath of relief, Xu Yunfan suddenly spat out a mouthful of stagnant blood.

To clash head-on with a Golden Core True Lord, utilize three types of sword intent, and then manipulate the Void-Crossing Boat to traverse the Sea of Chaos while constantly avoiding the Chaotic Light of Creation and Destruction—each of these tasks was immensely taxing. The fact that he had held on until now surpassed ninety-nine percent of those in the same realm.

He was now at the end of his rope.

He quickly sat down cross-legged, ignoring the surrounding environment, and immediately circulated the *Mystic Celestial Nine Firmament Immortal Void True Scripture*, forcibly squeezing the potential of his Dao Body. He drew upon the residual starlight power within the Star Spirit Banner to heal his injuries. The purple-gold lightning around him flickered dimly.

Although the energy in this world was mixed, he had already cultivated the embryonic form of a Small World. His Small World rotated slightly, absorbing the various attribute energies mixed within, filtering them into the purest form of energy to flow into his magical body. This gradually replenished his body and compensated for his depleted magical power.

Ye Xuan was unceremoniously sealed in a corner of the Void-Crossing Boat, unable to move, forced to watch helplessly.

At this moment, a faint fluctuation was sensed by his spiritual sense.

The Martial Dao Sky Eye between Xu Yunfan's brows instinctively opened and closed, a golden light flashing past.

Immediately after, he frowned slightly, enduring his discomfort as he stood up, and his spiritual sense swept toward the depths of the forest below.

Three hundred miles away, a middle-aged man with golden hair and blue eyes, clad in heavy plate armor full of cracks, lay collapsed at the foot of a giant tree, his breath weak. The strong scent of blood on him had attracted many lurking shadows in the darkness.

A Western barbarian?

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. Judging by the opponent's attire and the faint supernatural aura emanating from him, combined with the extremely mixed and chaotic energies of various attributes in the world, it reminded him of the world of swords and magic described in the web novels he had read in his previous life.

He needed to learn the basic situation of this world from this person.

Being completely in the dark was not an option.

He grabbed Ye Xuan, and his figure flashed, appearing three hundred miles away in the blink of an eye.

The dying knight seemed to sense the gaze descending from the air and struggled to lift his head. In his blurry vision, he caught sight of Xu Yunfan's flowing robe and sleeves, and the massive shadow behind him.

His lips moved, and he used his last bit of strength to shout.

"Be careful!"

Almost as he spoke, accompanied by a muffled roar and the sound of trees snapping, a ferocious beast resembling a wild boar but as massive as a small mountain crashed through several trees. Carrying a foul wind that swept up to the sky, it charged violently toward Xu Yunfan's back.

Its tusks were like spears, glinting with a dark light, and its short, coarse hair stood on end, containing explosive energy.

Xu Yunfan didn't even turn his head.

His spiritual sense had already enveloped the surroundings. In his peak condition, such a beast was not even as insignificant as an ant.

Even though he was now severely injured and weak, his status as a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator remained.

The residual Mystic Celestial power in his body surged, carrying a hint of thunder and wind. His wide sleeves casually brushed backward.

There was no earth-shattering bang, only a dull impact.

The boar-like beast, as large as a small mountain, was as if struck by an invisible giant hammer. Its charging posture instantly froze, and then it flew backward at a speed faster than its charge.

"Boom!"

The giant beast's massive body slammed heavily onto a rock wall hundreds of meters away. The entire wall instantly cracked and sank, forming a huge deep pit.

Amidst the swirling dust, the beast was embedded at the bottom of the pit, its bones shattered, dead on the spot.

The strength it prided itself on and that bit of energy aura were as fragile as a不堪一击 (paper) before a casual strike from a Foundation Establishment cultivator containing the power of a Dao Foundation.

"Hm?"

Xu Yunfan looked up at the sky above. His mind moved, and he continuously cast three layers of Karma secret techniques to conceal himself. He also quickly dissipated his magical power, stirring up the mixed energies in the air.

The next moment, an extremely obscure fluctuation spread rapidly from afar, sweeping over the forest several times. Seeing that it could not find any information, it gradually dissipated.

There were experts in this world.

Xu Yunfan was not surprised. Although the energy in this world was mixed, it was extremely abundant. It was only natural that powerful supernatural beings would be born here.

Confirming that his tracks had not been exposed and casually swatting away the annoying beast, Xu Yunfan's gaze fell back on the dying foreign knight.

The opponent had clearly seen the casual strike just now, and his blue eyes were filled with a mixture of horror and a final plea.

Xu Yunfan's eyes were calm.

This realm had living creatures, and this living person in front of him might be able to provide information, such as the environment, dangers, and even the source of energy.

His figure flashed, and he appeared beside the knight.

The Void-Crossing Boat was retracted into his sleeve, shrinking as it went. Ye Xuan, who was also retracted, could only continue to be confined in a corner of the banner.

Xu Yunfan crouched down, ignoring the knight's wariness. His right hand glowed with a layer of dark, sinister red light—it was the Soul Searching secret technique proficiently used by the Hundred Desires Peak.

The *Heaven and Earth Interchange Yin-Yang Separation and Union Scripture* is not only adept in dual cultivation methods; it can involve physical union, and even spiritual union, union with all things.

However, he had to be careful not to draw upon his magical power or display strength completely different from this world, otherwise he would likely be detected.

His current identity was an unregistered resident, an extraterrestrial demon.

Not only would the natives of this world not tolerate him, but the very Dao of this world would not tolerate him.

The cultivators of the Taihua Lingxu Realm, especially the three major sects, were far too familiar with this matter.

World invasions were a common occurrence, and everyone had formed their own unique established patterns.

As soon as Xu Yunfan's hand glowed with an eerie rainbow light, the knight's heart sank.

This black-haired, black-eyed man was probably not a good person.

"Stop..."

The knight let out a desperate cry, but his severely injured body could not resist at all.

Xu Yunfan's finger, carrying a cold, piercing spiritual light, pointed toward the knight's forehead.

Soul searching was not omnipotent; it could damage information, especially when the opponent's spirit resisted or their soul was unique. But who was Xu Yunfan now? With the Attribute Panel, the success rate was naturally ninety-nine percent.

To say that is still being modest.

He wanted the basic appearance of this world, the threats, and possible resource locations.

The opponent had kindly warned him, so Xu Yunfan naturally would not treat him poorly. He would later draw upon some of the grass and wood essence of this world to heal him.

As his fingertip touched the knight's brow, Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense invaded the other's consciousness sea.
