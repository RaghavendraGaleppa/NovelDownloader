# Chapter 294: Swift and Decisive

The sleeves of his robe shattered inch by inch, revealing forearms bulging with blue veins. Fine beads of blood seeped from beneath his skin, clearly a result of the sheer force rupturing his capillaries.

*Boom!*

The snow surged like an enraged tide.

Zhao Wujia slid back three zhang, the iron nails on his boots carving two furrows of sparks across the black stone.

A metallic tang rose in his throat, but he saw that Xu Yunfan’s blood and energy were churning violently. His momentum was fierce, like a tiger chasing through the snow as his mace technique shifted from a downward slash to a sweeping arc. The transformation flowed seamlessly, a signature move of the Nine Profound Dragon Subduing Mace Technique.

Although the Nine Profound Dragon Subduing Mace Technique was of a slightly lower grade than the Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall Mace Technique, its perfected mastery still held terrifying power.

Where the crimson mace shadow swept past, the snow churned as if plowed. The intense heat tore a scorching, blackened gash over a zhang long into the ground.

The scorching internal energy driven by the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, combined with his raging vital energy, instantly vaporized the accumulated snow!

Xu Yunfan’s spine, like a great dragon, connected segment by segment. The unique sound of jade bones resonating from the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Transformation Technique crackled from his joints.

Every muscle, forged as if a thousand times, resembled fine steel, gleaming with a fluid metallic luster as he exerted his strength.

Zhao Wujia’s venomous dagger aimed for his Tanzhong acupoint, but Xu Yunfan paid it no mind, simply continuing to swing his heavy mace.

*Just try to survive this!*

On the arena, even as the second-ranked true disciple of the Sect Master, it would be no injustice if he were beaten to death.

Zhao Wujia’s heart hardened. Ignoring everything else, his dagger tore through the air with a sharp whistle. It pierced Xu Yunfan’s robe but suddenly stopped, followed by the sharp clang of metal striking metal.

His pupils constricted violently. Through the hole in the pierced robe, he saw a flash of dark gold.

“Divine Armor?!”

The flying snow had not yet touched the ground before it was steamed into white mist by the two fighters’ vital energy.

An ancient bronze bell at the edge of the arena, caught in the shockwaves, began to tremble and emit a deep, resonant hum.

On the high platform, Li Zhi’s fingers, which had been stroking his wooden sword, paused. He snorted coldly, “Quite the brute force.”

Bi Yuan smiled without speaking, but his gaze drifted toward Chu Canglun on the corner of the eaves.

The eldest disciple still sat with eyes closed, hugging his sword, as if utterly uninterested in the fierce battle on the arena.

He felt a hint of disappointment. He had always wanted Chu Canglun to break free from the cage of the Dao Sect, but he never expected the man to sink even deeper.

At that critical moment, Zhao Wujia had barely managed to block a strike from the divine weapon heavy mace. His face was ashen, and as he stumbled to steady himself, his aura was incredibly weak.

The next instant, he suddenly bit the tip of his tongue, spitting out a mist of blood.

The blood mist touched the dagger and transformed into dozens of blue, glowing毒丝 (poison threads), which shot toward Xu Yunfan like a spider web.

“Binding Soul Silk of Profound Poison?”

Someone below the stage exclaimed in shock, “Zhao Wujia actually cultivated a forbidden technique!”

With the revival of the world’s spiritual energy, secrets passed down for two thousand years naturally had the chance to be reopened. No one had expected Zhao Wujia to have mastered such a method.

Yutuo Peak was, after all, the only faction within the Dao Sect that dealt in poison.

Xu Yunfan’s pupils shrank. The Lin Seal instantly activated, and his figure darted between the gaps in the poison threads like a swimming fish.

As a thread grazed the hem of his robe, the fabric immediately corroded into ash.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained cold and indifferent, without a trace of panic. Having cultivated the Lin Seal for so long, even without entering the Lin State, he still possessed astonishing judgment.

He plunged his Blazing Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace into the ground. A wisp of Pure Yang true energy erupted again, and a circle of crimson light burst from the mace’s tail.

Wherever the light passed, the poison threads snapped one after another.

He seized the opportunity to press forward, his left hand forming the Cicada Strength finger seal as he pointed toward Zhao Wujia’s Tanzhong acupoint.

Zhao Wujia hurriedly leaned back, but he saw Xu Yunfan’s right hand had already swept the crimson mace across.

*Bang!*

Zhao Wujia flew off the arena like a torn sack, crashing heavily into a snowdrift.

The arena fell silent for a moment, then erupted in an uproar.

Cui Yu, his expression unchanged, struck the bronze bell. “Arena One, Xu Yunfan is victorious. Zhao Wujia of Yutuo Peak is defeated.”

The wind and snow grew more intense. The completely unconscious Zhao Wujia was hurriedly carried away to see if he could still be saved.

Suddenly, from the southeast corner, a clear voice rang out. “Zhou Ziling of Yuheng Peak, here to challenge Senior Brother Xu!”

A young man with seven short swords strapped to his back leaped onto the arena. The sword case clicked open, and the seven swords fanned out behind him like a peacock’s tail.

“Be careful, Junior Brother Xu…” Zhou Ziling smiled. “This ‘Seven Star Locking Soul Sword Array’ of mine was just recently mastered借助 (by borrowing) the revived spiritual energy of the world. It specializes in countering body-refining techniques.”

Xu Yunfan shook his numb right arm. Hidden in his mouth, he rolled one of the ginseng threads and began to slowly chew it.

Zhao Wujia’s strength was indeed not bad. He would have been more than a match for the true disciples of the other five top sects in Great Zhou. If not for the fact that Xu Yunfan was on a different level, this poison thread technique, catching its opponent off guard, could have claimed many victims.

He suddenly recalled the essentials of the *Mountain Severing Sword* he had read in the Langhuan Library. Although he hadn’t cultivated it, there were always相通之处 (common principles) between weapons.

Glancing at a proficiency prompt that had just appeared in his line of sight, Xu Yunfan couldn’t help but mutter to himself.

Fighting gave far less proficiency than his own training. Wasting time on these people was pointless.

“Please.”

He held his mace horizontally, and the Pure Yang true energy he had just recovered subtly seeped into the weapon’s body.

One ginseng thread could keep him in peak condition for a considerable time.

The few threads hidden under his tongue were merely a precaution. Xu Yunfan had no intention of wasting his own energy if he didn’t have to.

Zhou Ziling drew a sword seal with his fingers, and his energy surged. Guided by his fingertips, the seven swords shot through the air like falling meteors, aiming for Xu Yunfan’s seven major acupoints.

This technique, which resembled sword control, naturally drew exclamations of surprise from many Dao Sect disciples.

But some could see clearly that Zhou Ziling was merely taking a shortcut. It was a far cry from true sword control, not by ten thousand miles, but by a hundred thousand.

“Senior Brother Zhou, your swords are flying too slowly.”

Xu Yunfan didn’t dodge or evade. He swung his crimson mace in a perfect arc, using it like a sword to unleash the essence of the *Mountain Severing* technique!

*Clang!*

Amidst the sound of metal clashing, three of the short swords shattered on the spot.

Zhou Ziling’s expression changed drastically. He pulled his hands back, and one could see faint, almost imperceptible丝线 (threads) twitching at his fingertips. The remaining four swords hastily returned to defend, but Xu Yunfan took a step forward. His figure stirred the wind and thunder as his left palm, carrying the force of the Red Python Mountain Crushing Technique, slammed toward the core of the sword case.

“Break!”

With a soft shout, his palm wind exploded like a blast furnace. The remaining four swords let out a mournful cry and fell to the ground.

Zhou Ziling’s face turned deathly pale. He stumbled back, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, but he said nothing. He understood well that the sword array he had painstakingly cultivated according to the two-thousand-year-old method of sword control was nothing more than a showy facade before a true powerhouse.

But to outsiders, this technique was dazzling enough. If the world’s spiritual energy had truly revived for a longer period of time, it might have been possible to detach from the threads and achieve true sword control.

“I admit defeat.”

Zhou Ziling shook his head, gathered the seven short swords with a gesture, and quickly left the arena. There was no sign of dejection on his face; on the contrary, he seemed a little delighted. Without a backward glance at the arena, he hurried back toward Yuheng Peak.

On the high platform, a sharp light flashed in Cui Yu’s eyes.

But at that moment, Chu Canglun opened his eyes, his gaze piercing the arena like a sword.

In two consecutive matches, Xu Yunfan had won swiftly and decisively.

Zhao Wujia of Xuanyao Peak was sent flying by a mace strike, his life or death unknown. Zhou Ziling of Yuheng Peak had his Seven Star Locking Soul Sword Array forcibly broken, losing three swords and forcing him to admit defeat.
