# Chapter 86: The Simple Folk of the God-Forsaken Land

A blood flower bloomed in the sky above the God-Forsaken Land, sending debris scattering and figures flying backward. Although this was merely the edge of the God-Forsaken Land, it was still inhabited. The explosion high in the sky drew the attention of many. Some glanced, their eyes glinting, then looked away, uninterested. Battles were common here, and they had no desire to get involved. Others, however, pinpointed the location, their figures flashing as they raced towards where the figures from the explosion would land, hoping to scavenge a corpse or two and make a quick fortune.

As time slowly passed, a figure suddenly appeared high in the sky, roughly at the center of the explosion. Naked from the waist down, he plummeted downwards. Zhou Tian's face was a mask of confusion. He only felt the cool wind on his bare skin. *Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing?*

It took him a moment to recall that he had been disintegrated by the bloody wave unleashed by the divine spear. His daily resurrection count had been used to empower [Holy Word], meaning his Immortal System's resurrection count must have reset, and he had subsequently revived. However, the suffocating sensation, the rapidly approaching landmass of the God-Forsaken Land, and the painful slap of his manhood against his chest made him feel very, very uncomfortable.

Since the ancient ship had exploded a considerable distance from the landmass of the God-Forsaken Land, he still had a fair amount of time to free-fall before reaching the ground. With nothing else to do, Zhou Tian held his little brother down to prevent it from flapping in the wind and obstructing his view, then took in the scenery of the God-Forsaken Land. Contrary to his mental image of a desolate Gobi desert, even at the edge of the God-Forsaken Land, there was a dense jungle.

This appeared to be a mountain range. In the distance, an ancient divine mountain pierced the clouds. Zhou Tian couldn't estimate its exact distance; with his current eyesight, he could only vaguely make out its form. The divine mountain was wreathed in clouds halfway up, towering majestically. The mountain range stretched all the way to his current position, covered by ancient trees. Occasionally, earth-shaking roars echoed, the kings of the mountain range declaring their territories. As the ground drew closer, Zhou Tian sighed. "From now on, I, your bro, will also be..."

*Splat!*

He was torn to pieces, brains splattering everywhere. This time, Zhou Tian felt no pain at all, for the moment he hit the ground, he instantly became a pile of minced meat. And since he had already used up his resurrection count for the day, even after a long wait, he remained nothing more than a bloody, blurry mosaic.

A moment later, a figure appeared at the spot where Zhou Tian had splattered. Dressed in a white silk robe, with an aged face, the man's eyes twitched at the sight before him. From the minced meat, he could only discern two glistening halves of a large buttock: one on the ground, the other remarkably bounced onto a tree. He sighed, having expected to kill someone and steal their goods, only to witness such a disgusting sight. With a flash of white light, he vanished from the spot.

After a while, a leopard, its body shimmering with lightning, emerged from the forest with elegant strides. It was nearly three zhang long and one zhang tall. It sniffed at the corpse fragments on the ground, a remarkably human-like expression of disdain on its face. It then spat out lightning, arcs sizzling, scorching the meat until it was utterly charred. A meaty aroma emanated, yet the leopard did not eat. It turned and walked back into the forest, as if its previous action had merely been an act of venting. Several other fierce beasts passed by this spot: a lion with a purple horn, a crimson-flamed divine tiger with wings on its ribs, and a five-colored divine ox with only one leg. All instinctively avoided the area, as if something terrifying lurked there.

Another day passed. The time calculation in the God-Forsaken Land differed from Futian Continent. It was still daytime, but no matter how time was measured here, the Immortal System operated on a 24-hour cycle. As soon as the time was up, Zhou Tian's figure reappeared at the original spot, and the charred corpse fragments were gone.

"Why do these trees look like they've been struck by lightning?" Zhou Tian, having just revived, saw the scorched tree bark all around him and looked puzzled, wondering what had happened. He didn't dwell on it much. He plucked a few large leaves from the relatively intact trees nearby to cover his vital parts – not because he was particularly modest, but mainly to avoid hurting others' sensibilities. Then he randomly picked a direction, his figure flashing as he vanished from the spot.

This was his ninth death, and the distance of his [Teleport] had now increased to 900 meters, which was quite a considerable range. The trees in this forest were incredibly tall and dense, making it impossible to discern direction. Zhou Tian could only continuously teleport in one direction. After half a day, Zhou Tian finally teleported out of the forest and arrived at a plain. His luck was decent; as soon as he emerged, he saw wisps of smoke curling up in the distance.

Estimating the direction, Zhou Tian teleported again and soon found the source of the smoke. It was a small village, sparsely populated with only a few dozen households. At the village entrance stood an enormous tree, its canopy large enough to shade half the village. Beneath the tree, an old man sat, eyes half-closed, leaning against the trunk. Several children played nearby, creating a scene like a secluded paradise.

Zhou Tian stopped not far from the village entrance. The old man, whose eyesight seemed decent, stood up and walked towards Zhou Tian step by step. He showed no signs of frailty, instead moving with a powerful, tiger-like stride. This was fitting; after all, it was a village that could survive in the God-Forsaken Land. If the old man had been tottering, that would truly have been problematic. Zhou Tian also walked forward. He needed to figure out where he was and get some proper clothes; he couldn't very well keep himself covered in leaves.

The old man looked benevolent and kindly. As he approached, he spoke first: "Young man, why are you dressed like that?"

"Elder, I had a small accident. Could I possibly borrow some clothes from you?" Zhou Tian replied politely. *Treat others with courtesy, and they will treat you with courtesy.*

"No problem at all. When you're out and about, who hasn't encountered difficulties?" The old man agreed readily. Despite his age, there was a sense of righteousness about him. He pulled a simple robe from thin air and handed it to Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian was deeply moved, surprised that even in this God-Forsaken Land there were such simple and kind elders. He reached out to take the plain robe and then asked, "Elder, could you tell me where this place is?"

"Where is this place? Young man, do you see that ancient mountain?" The old man pointed towards the distant divine mountain. Zhou Tian nodded and looked as well. *Was that divine mountain some kind of famous landmark?*

*Pfft!*

A short sword abruptly thrust out from Zhou Tian's chest. Intense, piercing pain swept through his mind. The short sword glowed with a bloody light, directly extinguishing all life force in Zhou Tian's body, giving him no chance to speak. A lion uses its full strength even when hunting a rabbit; the old man, having survived for many years in the God-Forsaken Land, deeply understood this principle.

*So this is truly the simple folk of the God-Forsaken Land!* This was Zhou Tian's last thought before death.
