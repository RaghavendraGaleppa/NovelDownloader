Chapter 176: The Lotus

Zhou Tian raced ceaselessly towards the massive lotus. He only dared to travel during the day, as night transformed the area into a bloody world. Every silent spot contained entities far more dangerous than the creatures tainted by the blood rain, making close proximity lethal.

Zhou Tian had reverted to his old routine, using up all his daily resurrection chances at the last possible moment. After several days, he had accumulated three death opportunities.

As he drew closer to the great lotus, more detailed aspects were revealed. Although the lotus stood proudly between heaven and earth, a layer of ethereal mist flowed down its petals. It resembled a waterfall, descending from countless miles above, yet completely silent. The mist was colorless, appearing ancient and eternal, visible only upon close inspection. At night, this mist would turn blood-red, with twisted human faces swirling within it, truly chilling.

For the past few days, Zhou Tian hadn't encountered any external creatures other than himself, but today was an exception.

Boom!

A sonic boom echoed in the sky as a figure plummeted from high above, crashing into the ground not far from Zhou Tian. The earth rumbled, and cracks spread outwards. Another object then fell from the sky, glowing with white light—a long sword, which plunged into the very spot where the person had fallen.

A figure hovered in the sky. This person had white hair, wore white robes, and bore a cold expression. With his hands clasped behind his back, chaotic energy swirled around him, and terrifying power emanated from his form.

"Little brother!"

Zhou Tian was stunned, for the person before him was none other than Sheng Mo.

Sheng Mo clearly noticed Zhou Tian as well. He descended from the sky, waved a hand, and the long sword flew out of the crater into his grasp. With a gentle tremor, the sword hummed loudly, and a thread of blood was shaken off.

"I finally found you." Sheng Mo's furrowed brow relaxed.

"Found me? How did you find me in such a vast place?" Zhou Tian asked. He had thought it was a coincidence, but from Sheng Mo's tone, it seemed not.

"I left a mark on you. The moment you entered this world, I sensed your position. Though later, for some reason, my mark disappeared, I had a general direction, so I came looking." Sheng Mo said calmly, an air of knowing exactly what he was doing.

"Oh, that was to prevent me from escaping, wasn't it?" Zhou Tian replied with a cold expression.

"..." Sheng Mo didn't answer, but it was obvious.

"Why are you wearing a tattered kasaya?" Sheng Mo asked, as Zhou Tian's kasaya had indeed become ragged after enduring such harsh conditions.

"An old monk gave it to me. Forget about me, where did you get your information? It's so wildly inaccurate, 'Half-step Heavenly Venerate' is ridiculously wrong!" Zhou Tian scolded Sheng Mo indirectly, then recounted the information he had received from Puzhi, thoroughly mocking him.

After listening, Sheng Mo's gaze deepened. He didn't show much shock, but rather a look of sudden realization. "No wonder they were so attentive to me. So it's because of Wu Tian and the concept of reincarnation?"

"What do you mean?" Zhou Tian scratched his head, finding Sheng Mo's words a bit difficult to understand.

"I never quite understood why Luo Tian Temple was so invested in me, offering so much help and even supporting me from behind. It couldn't just be because I inherited the legacy of a Half-step Heavenly Venerate Buddha, could it?" Sheng Mo pondered. "Perhaps they believed I was the reincarnation of the Wu Tian Buddha Ancestor."

Sheng Mo understood many things, and also let out a sigh of relief. Luo Tian Temple had indeed been incredibly good to him, but it had always left him feeling uneasy. There was no such thing as causeless kindness, let alone from a force of Luo Tian Temple's caliber. Now that he knew the reason, a large burden had been lifted from his heart.

"Reincarnation? Is that possible?" Zhou Tian asked, somewhat uncertainly. In his previous life, Zhou Tian would have slapped his chest and loudly declared it impossible, but in this world, anything seemed possible.

"I don't know, but after coming here, I did have a faint, guiding sensation, but it wasn't towards that great lotus. It was in that direction." Sheng Mo pointed towards the location of the gigantic Buddha illusion.

"Really? Are you truly the reincarnation of that incredible person?" Zhou Tian was a little surprised.

"I am me!" Sheng Mo's eyes shone brightly as he spoke with firm conviction.

"Fireworks of a different color," Zhou Tian added, quoting a popular phrase.

"What now? Are we still going to that great lotus?" Zhou Tian asked.

"Yes, why wouldn't we?" Sheng Mo's Dao heart was like iron; he didn't hesitate in the slightest. Having come this far, there was no way he would easily retreat.

Next, Sheng Mo took Zhou Tian towards the great lotus. Sheng Mo's speed was far greater than Zhou Tian's, and within just a few hours, the two had already approached the lotus. Besides them, there were seven other individuals present, all of them Heavenly King-level existences.

Everyone hovered in the void, making no movements, which greatly surprised Zhou Tian. He had expected a major battlefield here, but it seemed everyone was waiting for something.

Sensing Sheng Mo's arrival, several people turned their chilling gazes towards him, but their expressions changed abruptly, and they quickly withdrew their stares, apparently injured by Sheng Mo's aura.

"Are you trying to provoke us?" Someone stood up and shouted. It was a King-level Stone Spirit, his entire body composed of obsidian-like stone. His words contained hidden murderous intent. Every new arrival meant a share of the opportunity would be diluted, and he wanted everyone to rise up and attack Sheng Mo together!

"Hmph!" Sheng Mo snorted coldly, his face twisting as holy light and demonic qi coexisted. A strand of dark matter transformed into a small sword, piercing through space. Before the Stone Spirit's disbelieving eyes, his body shattered, dim and lifeless, directly annihilated.

Everyone looked at Sheng Mo with wary eyes. Several individuals were restless, thunder rumbling continuously, and sword qi crisscrossing the void! Since Sheng Mo was currently the strongest, and the two Dao Lords from Border Purgatory and Abyss Tomb were not present, they wanted to eliminate him together. However, no one was willing to make the first move, fearing they would be taken down first.

"Not bad, little brother, you didn't disgrace me." Zhou Tian nodded, looking quite satisfied.

Everyone was aghast, looking at Zhou Tian with disbelief. Sheng Mo was so powerful, yet he was only Zhou Tian's "little brother"? How strong must the "big brother" be? Although they could all tell there were no spiritual energy fluctuations from Zhou Tian, they merely assumed he had concealed himself, not wanting to expose his true power.

Sheng Mo ignored Zhou Tian's comment, taking him to hover above the lotus. It was then that they saw, deep within the lotus, a flower bud slowly blooming, flickering with seven-colored light, as if something extraordinary was brewing within.

Zhou Tian suddenly realized that everyone had been waiting for this flower bud to fully open.
