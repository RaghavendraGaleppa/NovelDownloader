# Chapter 6: One Sword  

The north wind howled like a blade, lashing against Dou Changsheng's face and forcing him to narrow his eyes. His sharp gaze fixed on the armored figure standing ahead—Wang Xiong, the Ironclad Lion King, whose appearance had drastically changed since their last encounter.  

Once already towering and burly, Wang Xiong now stood even more intimidatingly, easily surpassing two meters in height, likely around two and a half. His thick arms were thicker than an average man's thighs, and his mere presence exuded an oppressive aura.  

Spotting Dou Changsheng, Wang Xiong's eyes turned icy as he spoke in a cold, heavy voice, "Dou Changsheng!"  

"Thanks to you," he continued, his tone devoid of joy and instead filled with unspoken agony, "I've broken through. Now, I'm a Xiantian martial artist."  

The bitterness in his words was unmistakable, revealing the torment in his heart.  

Wang Xiong's expression twisted with resentment as he glared at Dou Changsheng with undisguised hatred.  

The failed attempt to seize the military supplies and his subsequent forced breakthrough into the Xiantian realm were not rewards—they were punishments.  

At thirty-six, Wang Xiong was in the prime of his life. Having forged an ironclad physique, he had cultivated abundant Postnatal Qi, unblocked his meridians, and was only a few years away from fully opening the Heaven and Earth acupoints.  

For a Xiantian martial artist at forty, while unremarkable among prodigies, it was a respectable achievement for a wandering cultivator lacking resources and proper training.  

Forty was still young—he could have aimed higher. That was why he had willingly stepped into this dangerous game, hoping to obtain a Xiantian martial art to push his limits further.  

But now, all of that was gone.  

His breakthrough hadn't been his own doing. Instead, someone had forcibly pierced his Heaven and Earth acupoints with overwhelming Xiantian True Qi, forcibly elevating his Postnatal Qi into Xiantian Qi.  

Though the external force had expanded his meridians and stabilized his foundation—making him no weaker than a naturally advanced Xiantian martial artist—it had also sealed his future.  

At thirty-six, this was his peak. At fifty-six, he would still be the same.  

Never progressing again—such despair was unbearable. Even now, Wang Xiong felt as if ants were gnawing at his heart day after day.  

Worse still, the one who had "helped" him break through had left a strand of controlling True Qi within him.  

Disobedience meant a fate worse than death.  

His life was now shrouded in darkness.  

Wang Xiong knew this was the price of making deals with tigers. He wasn't the lucky one—just another victim devoured by the ruthless.  

Yet, he hadn't taken his own life. Because deep down, he still clung to vengeance.  

Not just against Dou Changsheng, but also against the one who had done this to him.  

And there was still a sliver of hope. The world was vast, filled with wonders. Some had suffered worse fates than his, only to stumble upon heavenly treasures and reverse their destinies.  

Watching as Dou Changsheng slowed his horse, Wang Xiong sneered, "You can't escape."  

"My ambush is just the first wave—a test."  

"To me, they're being too cautious."  

"I've told them time and again—you only have Xiantian Qi, not the skill to wield it. But they refuse to believe me."  

"Back then, in the heat of battle, I was scared, my mind clouded. I forgot many things."  

"But after returning, I remembered. When I first targeted you, I observed you for a long time—your posture, your gait, the calluses on your hands—everything."  

"Even after approaching you, I confirmed it myself—you had no Qi in your body."  

"That was my mistake. As a Postnatal martial artist, I couldn’t perceive the subtleties of Xiantian Qi. But no martial artist would lack physical signs of training."  

"If you were a swordsman, years of practice would leave distinct marks—nothing like the calluses of a farmer. I grew up poor; I’ve seen enough of the lower class to know the difference."  

"You’ve always been just a village boy, exactly as the records say."  

"Not some noble in disguise."  

"That Xiantian Qi in you? Just a powerful martial artist’s trick, stored inside you through some secret technique."  

"That’s why you didn’t save that swordsman—because you’re no Xiantian martial artist. You’re a fraud."  

"You’re just a pawn, a decoy used by the Black Hawk Sect to divert our attention, to lure us into splitting our forces."  

"And I’d say it worked."  

"Those fools wouldn’t listen to me. They insisted on dividing our strength."  

"Worse, instead of attacking you all at once, they sent me first—to test you, to confirm your limits before making their move."  

"A complete waste of time. Had they listened to me, we’d already have taken that tenth of the military supplies."  

With that, Wang Xiong lunged forward, his massive frame charging like a runaway freight train, unstoppable and overwhelming.  

"Let me show them," he roared, veins bulging like coiling serpents on his arms, his face contorted with fury. His fist, large as a sandbag, rose high, gathering terrifying force.  

*Finally.*  

Dou Changsheng’s tense heart settled.  

Wang Xiong had been flawless in his stance—attacking first would have revealed his intent, allowing Wang Xiong to dodge.  

But now, with Wang Xiong committing to his strike, Dou Changsheng saw his chance.  

With a slap to his horse’s flank, the beast surged forward in pain.  

A rusted sword flashed from its scabbard, a streak of cold light. Xiantian Qi erupted from the blade, swift as lightning. The horse’s momentum added even greater speed.  

Dou Changsheng ignored Wang Xiong’s incoming fist entirely.  

His sword pierced straight through the *Shenque* acupoint.  

Wang Xiong’s vital point shattered. His Xiantian Qi spiraled out of control, ravaging his organs. His once-mighty punch turned feeble.  

Dou Changsheng sheathed his sword as his horse galloped past.  

A single, indifferent phrase drifted back:  

"I’m in a hurry."
