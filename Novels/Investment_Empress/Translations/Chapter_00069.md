# Chapter 69: Star Child Hammer, Li Mo, Master of Time Management

“I’ll take these, thank you for your trouble.”

“Hmm, Junior Brother, I advise you to eat these fresh. Don’t store them for too long.”

“Oh? Deacon, you have such insight? It seems you are a fellow connoisseur.”

“Oh, not at all.”

“I’ll go back and cook now. We should have hotpot together sometime.”

Li Mo cupped his hands to the deacon.

And so, amidst the bewildered gazes of the onlookers, Student Li, carrying two baskets of exotic beast meat, strolled out of the External Affairs Hall.

“Senior Brother, how do you know which exotic beasts are delicious?” an outer sect deacon pondered thoughtfully.

The inner sect deacon, who had given Li Mo many recommendations earlier, said with a profound gaze, “You’re asking a lot of questions today.”

…

Autumn Water Pavilion.

By the time Li Mo returned, it was already noon.

Time was short, but his skills were superb. And since the ‘Ice Lump’ hadn’t returned yet, only Shang Wu was in the pavilion. After feeding his master, he went to the front of the waterfall.

“Profound Weapon Embryo.”

Li Mo looked at the soft, metallic sphere in his palm, which bounced 'duang-duang' like a Slime. To replicate a weapon based on a template, and it must be a top-grade profound weapon. If the Panjie Meteorite Hammer were the template, it would likely be its ultimate weakened version. Perhaps like the Chixiao Sword to the Fenkong Sword? But it should be slightly more powerful than the Chixiao Sword. He’d heard others mention that the Chixiao Sword was a high-grade profound weapon.

Thinking of this, Li Mo took out the Chixiao Sword and walked behind the waterfall.

“Fire Crane Thousand Feathers!”

He swung his sword at the thick rock wall. A sword art at the perfection realm, combined with a profound weapon, yielded exceptional results. It was like cutting tofu. The cut stone was directly absorbed into his small world, and he quickly carved out a ‘cave dwelling.’

“Hah… I’m much stronger than the first time I activated the world seed. After taking it out, I should have enough strength to put it back.”

Li Mo took a deep breath. There was no other way. The physical changes within the small world could not affect the outside. He couldn’t use the Panjie Meteorite Hammer for cultivation while inside the world seed. He could only take it out.

Om—

The surrounding air vibrated. In that instant, the overwhelming divine power that felt capable of grasping the heavens reappeared. Compared to the first activation, Li Mo was much more proficient. Within the cave he had carved, a sharp, weapon-like aura immediately filled the air, leaving sword and saber marks on the granite walls.

Without wasting a single moment, he immediately took out the Panjie Meteorite Hammer. Holding the divine weapon again, a strong tremor ran through his heart. His instincts made him eager to unleash its primeval power. But Li Mo held back. Reason told him that he would find it hard to bear the consequences if he swung that hammer. He gently placed the hammer on the ground, and only then did he deactivate the world seed’s enhancement.

“Hah…” Li Mo, drenched in sweat, let out a long breath. A wave of weakness washed over his body, but it was still better than fainting outright like last time.

Om—

The Panjie Meteorite Hammer vibrated twice, like a young child, excited to be out and frolic.

“Smash…” Once it got excited, it wanted to smash something.

Activating the perfection realm ‘Extreme Soldier’s Body Refinement’ technique, Li Mo wiped his sweat and said, “Good boy, we need to be a civilized divine weapon. A civilized divine weapon doesn’t easily make a move. Never mind hurting people, it’s not good to harm the flowers and plants either.”

Om—

The Panjie Meteorite Hammer responded with a brief vibration. As Li Mo’s cultivation deepened, the area of his small world also grew. Apart from having no living beings, it was much more comfortable than the bottom of the Divine Edge Cave.

“Don’t move around too much, okay?” Li Mo nodded in satisfaction.

With that, he covered the profound weapon embryo onto the Panjie Meteorite Hammer.

Om—

The mercury-like metal liquid enveloped the entire hammer and began to vibrate violently. The profound weapon embryo was meticulously simulating and replicating the Panjie Meteorite Hammer’s form, aura, and essence. Of course, its limit was that of a profound weapon.

“I hope you don’t disappoint me.” Li Mo watched for a while, then sat down cross-legged. He hadn’t practiced Extreme Soldier’s Body Refinement for a long time. Now that he could take out and put back the divine weapon, tempering his physique would naturally become an indispensable part of his daily routine. Hammer techniques placed extremely high demands on physique and blood qi.

Unconsciously, the sunlight outside the window dimmed. A figure emerged from behind the waterfall. The gushing waterfall water caused billowing white steam to rise from his body, making him appear like a newly forged weapon. After becoming the master of the divine weapon, his cultivation progress with the Panjie Meteorite Hammer was truly visible to the naked eye. His physical body was already advancing to the next level.

However, after activating the world seed twice, he was utterly exhausted. “Fortunately, I made dinner at noon,” Student Li sighed with relief. He didn’t stop, instead dripping Ten Thousand Year Earth Vein Spirit Milk into the pool. After lying in it, enveloped by the earth vein essence, his body’s fatigue finally began to subside.

He activated the Fire Heart Born Lotus Method. Only then did Li Mo have time to take out the newly replicated hammer and examine it carefully.

“Its appearance is not much different from the Panjie Meteorite Hammer,” he mused. “The aura is also quite similar, just much, much weaker. Emmm… Panjie Meteorite Hammer Youth Mini Version?” Student Li felt the name was a bit too long. Then he reconsidered, isn’t this just the son of the Panjie Meteorite Hammer? “From now on, I’ll call you Star Child Hammer.”

…

Five days passed in a flash.

Student Li had been very busy recently. He had to cultivate himself, refine his body, and temper his blood qi. He also had to make time to feed the ‘Ice Lump’ and his beautiful Master in Autumn Water Pavilion. At night, he couldn’t rest either, having to satisfy the tireless Little Princess Jiang. From time to time, he even had to have ‘in-depth discussions’ with the ‘Ice Lump’... concerning swordsmanship.

“Damn, I’m practically a master of time management!”

That evening, Li Mo dragged his exhausted body back to Autumn Water Pavilion. He poured a pot of water and gulped it down. He sat down at the stone table and sighed, “I don’t want to move. I really don’t want to cook today…”

“Humans are iron, food is steel! My precious disciple, you’re so tired, how can you not eat?” Shang Wu said righteously, propping her chin on one hand.

Li Mo shot her a glance, thinking, *Then why don’t you bother, Master?*

Shang Wu raised her chin, smugly saying, “This master knows nothing about cooking.”

“?” *So what are you smug about?*

Just then, a certain ‘Ice Lump’ spoke up, “Then why don’t I go…”

“No need!” the master and disciple said in unison.

Shang Wu, as if rising from her deathbed, sat bolt upright. Li Mo’s bodily fatigue was instantly swept away as he flashed into the kitchen. His Wind Shadow Step finally found a practical application.

“Little Bing’er, didn’t you cultivate in the Ice Fire Pool all day today? You should rest well.” Shang Wu was afraid she might do something rash.

Ying Bing, who was calmly sipping tea, slightly furrowed her delicate brows. “I meant, we could have someone deliver food from the Internal Affairs Hall canteen.”

Autumn Water Pavilion’s highest alert was lifted.

Shang Wu sighed in relief, then examined Ying Bing for a moment. Suddenly noticing something amiss, she said in surprise, “Little Bing’er, your blood qi has already integrated perfectly. You’re about to break through, aren’t you?” She was referring to a major realm.

Ying Bing nodded slightly, her jade-like countenance showing little fluctuation. Her tone was as faint as the tea in her cup: “Tonight.”

Many martial artists were trapped outside the Inner Breath Realm their entire lives, unable to enter. But having already walked this path in her previous life, she would not encounter any bottlenecks. It was merely a matter of circulating blood qi through the twenty-four meridians and breaking into the Inner Breath Realm with the power of Grand Yin. To her, it was nothing more than a trivial advancement, hardly worth mentioning. The reason for breaking through tonight was also as a precaution. For the system’s ranking, she absolutely had to be at the top.
