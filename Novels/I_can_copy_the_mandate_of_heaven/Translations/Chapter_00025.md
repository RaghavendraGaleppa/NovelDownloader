## Chapter 25: One Year Later

The days that followed were like a blur for Han Li. He had transformed into a completely different person, barely speaking a word. He would often leave the valley, only returning late at night, much to Li Zhi Ming's concern. No matter what Li Zhi Ming asked him, Han Li would simply shake his head and remain silent.

In a stone room deep within the valley, Mo Da Yi, dressed in a black robe, arrived with a cautious demeanor. He examined the surroundings, his eyes scanning the ground for any signs of disturbance. His gaze narrowed as he noticed that the footprints had been deliberately erased, including some of his own old ones.

Mo Da Yi's expression turned grave, and he swiftly opened the stone door. Upon entering, he was met with an eerie feeling, as if someone had recently invaded the space. He noticed faint footprints, slightly cleaned but still visible, and a thin layer of dust had been disturbed on the desk.

Without hesitation, Mo Da Yi approached the bookshelf and began to inspect the items. A sinister voice suddenly echoed through the room, "Hmph, old thing, you were smart for a lifetime, but foolish for a moment." The voice grew louder, more urgent, "You should have acted sooner."

The voice was not Mo Da Yi's; it was higher pitched and less refined. Mo Da Yi's body began to contort, his throat bulging as he emitted strange sounds not characteristic of his usual demeanor.

The voice continued to taunt Mo Da Yi, "You will eventually die at the hands of these two young children!" Mo Da Yi's response was a cold snort, "Cultivation? It has led to such nonsense."

The sinister voice grew more exasperated, but Mo Da Yi ignored it. He quickly gathered essential items, including a map and a book with a note. He then triggered a mechanism, revealing a hidden compartment behind the bookshelf.

From the compartment, he retrieved a sealed box, which he opened. After taking out the contents, he set the box and its contents ablaze. As the flames engulfed the room, Mo Da Yi calmly exited, ensuring that no one suspected a thing.

He returned to the valley, resuming his normal routine. Li Zhi Ming had been concerned about Han Li's progress, frequently providing him with supplements and rare elixirs. Despite his efforts, Li Zhi Ming remained unaware of Han Li's actual cultivation.

As time passed, Han Li's condition continued to mystify Li Zhi Ming. His body weakened, and his hair turned white overnight. Despite this, Han Li's cultivation steadily improved.

When Li Zhi Ming was eleven years old, Han Li's cultivation reached the fourth layer of Qi Refining, (421/1300, Chang Chun Jue). Li Zhi Ming could see the progress, but he remained oblivious to the methods Han Li employed.

One day, Li Zhi Ming called out to someone, his voice now laced with a hoarse quality, a sign of his developing adolescence. "Pao Pao!" A large, gray-white fruit bat-like creature emerged from the valley, roughly half Li Zhi Ming's size. The creature enthusiastically wagged its tail, similar to a happy dog.

The creature, named Pao Pao, was from Li Zhi Ming's hometown. It had grown to three years old, with a white head and neck, and a gray body. Li Zhi Ming playfully teased Pao Pao, handing it a partially eaten wild fruit. Pao Pao took the fruit, then immediately spat it out, displaying a surprisingly human-like behavior.

Li Zhi Ming laughed, slightly embarrassed. He scolded Pao Pao, reminding it not to eat the medicinal fruits from the fields. Pao Pao quickly scurried away.

Upon entering his room, Li Zhi Ming was surprised to find Han Li at home, wrapping white cloth around his upper body. The scene seemed ordinary, yet something about it caught Li Zhi Ming's attention.
