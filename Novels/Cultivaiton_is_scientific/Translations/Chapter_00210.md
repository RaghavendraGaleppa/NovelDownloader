# Chapter 210: Taking a Master (Bonus Chapter for Fang Xiu V - Until Death Do Us Part)

Li Yuanba once again entered the mission hall of the Outer Sect Combat Division of the Senluo Sect and placed a corpse before the attendant.

"Mission complete," he said indifferently.

The attendant recognized him immediately. Although several days had passed, it was extremely rare for an elder to personally issue a mission, so how could he forget?

"Complete his mission and send him to the second floor," the attendant heard the elder's voice in his ear as he glanced toward the second floor.

The attendant quickly processed Li Yuanba's request. The contribution points on Li Yuanba's identity jade tablet increased to 4,050, and he began considering whether he could purchase any knowledge on formations now.

Li Yuanba didn't have to worry about cultivation resources for himself. Li Shiming had left his clone one million spirit stones, and the spoils from continuously completing missions and killing other cultivators added up to another substantial fortune.

His current main task was to accumulate contribution points, provide knowledge from the Senluo Sect to his main body, and search for third-grade Five Elements formation materials.

"Fellow Daoist, Elder Jian is waiting for you on the second floor," the attendant called out to Li Yuanba, who was about to leave to examine his latest gains.

Li Yuanba's heart tightened. Among the Senluo Sect's elders, he had only encountered one—Elder Lü, who didn't seem like a typical demonic sect Golden Core elder at all.

He didn't know who this Elder Jian was or why he wanted to see him, but he understood he couldn't refuse.

Nodding to the attendant, he ascended the stairs to the second floor.

The second floor was spacious, but only one person was present—a man leisurely sipping tea.

When Li Yuanba saw him, he didn't even register the man's appearance. In his perception, the figure before him wasn't a cultivator but a sheathed sword.

Other cultivators might not notice this, but as a sword cultivator himself, Li Yuanba could sense it clearly.

A sword sheathed was even more dangerous.

"This is a powerful sword cultivator—perhaps even more terrifying than Yun Xingyi!" Li Yuanba thought to himself.

Of course, when he had encountered Yun Xingyi, the latter had been at less than one percent of his full strength. It was impossible for Li Yuanba to judge who was stronger between Elder Jian and Yun Xingyi—he wasn't qualified to make such a comparison.

"Outer Sect disciple Li Yuanba greets Elder Jian!" Suppressing the pressure in his heart, he stepped forward and bowed respectfully.

Elder Jian had been observing Li Yuanba since he arrived on the second floor.

He was quite satisfied with what he saw.

As a Golden Core elder, he hadn't issued that mission to Li Yuanba out of boredom. It was Li Yuanba's sword intent that had caught his attention, prompting him to give the young man an opportunity.

Of course, if Li Yuanba had died at the hands of the Earth Sect's elite disciple despite being a sword cultivator, it would have simply meant he wasn't destined for this opportunity.

Among demonic sect elders, Elder Jian's method of testing disciples was already considered relatively normal.

"I called you here to inform you that you've passed my disciple assessment. I intend to take you as my personal disciple," Elder Jian stated bluntly.

Li Yuanba was momentarily stunned. He hadn't expected Elder Jian to say such a thing.

He had assumed it would take longer—at least until he entered the Inner Sect—before he could attract an elder's attention.

His consecutive mission completions had only recently begun circulating among some Foundation Establishment cultivators due to the short timeframe. If Elder Jian hadn't been available recently, Li Yuanba might indeed have had to wait until the Inner Sect selection to gain attention from other Golden Core elders.

"Disciple Li Yuanba greets Master!" After a brief pause, Li Yuanba quickly regained his composure, performing a deep bow and changing his form of address.

Wasn't joining a sect all about finding a powerful backer? At least Elder Jian didn't seem like one of those demonic path Golden Core elders who might one day use him as fodder for their cultivation.

"Li Yuanba, what cultivation techniques are you currently practicing?" Elder Jian retracted his aura and asked with a smile.

Instantly, Li Yuanba could no longer sense the oppressive presence from before. Elder Jian now appeared like an ordinary elderly mortal.

This level of control was something Li Yuanba hadn't yet achieved. Despite practicing the "Sword Demon Secret Canon" and the "Ten Directions Sword Cultivation Art," his sword intent remained palpable even in ordinary moments.

"Disciple practices the 'Sword Demon Secret Canon' and the 'Ten Directions Sword Cultivation Art'," Li Yuanba replied, having prepared for this question after his main body's experience with apprenticeship. He saw no need for concealment.

"The 'Ten Directions Sword Cultivation Art' is a heritage technique of the Mingxin Sect. However, since you passed the Heart Inquiry Hall's assessment, I assume you're not from the Mingxin Sect. How did you obtain it?" Elder Jian frowned slightly.

Elder Jian was familiar with the "Ten Directions Sword Cultivation Art"—his old rival Yun Xingyi practiced it. For other techniques, Elder Jian wouldn't have bothered asking about their origins.

This was his first time taking a disciple in the Senluo Sect, and he wanted no complications.

"Disciple obtained it from a cultivator's storage bag after killing him in the Tianhai Islands," Li Yuanba answered, mixing truth with deception.

"The Tianhai Islands! Could Yun Xingyi have perished there? No wonder his technique was leaked!" Elder Jian murmured to himself, not doubting Li Yuanba's words.

Though the Tianhai Islands were distant, verifying whether Yun Xingyi had died there was possible through various channels—like the Northern Shu Trading Company or sects like the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect that had connections to the islands.

"What body refinement technique do you practice? Why do I sense an aura of death within you?" Elder Jian placed a hand on Li Yuanba's shoulder briefly before asking another question.

"I practice the sword cultivator techniques from the 'Sword Demon Secret Canon'," Li Yuanba replied calmly, though inwardly he was worried Elder Jian might discover the secrets of his body.

Like Li Shiming's master, Elder Su of the Shushan Sect, Elder Jian had never heard of the "Sword Demon Secret Canon" either.

"Show me the 'Sword Demon Secret Canon'," Elder Jian requested.

Li Yuanba took out a blank jade slip, inscribed the contents of the "Sword Demon Secret Canon" onto it, and presented it to Elder Jian.

Though the formal apprenticeship hadn't been completed yet, Elder Jian was effectively already his master. Even if Elder Jian had asked for the "Ten Directions Sword Cultivation Art," Li Yuanba would have handed it over without hesitation.

After reading the jade slip, Elder Jian remained silent for a long time.

"What a pity. This sword cultivator sought to forge a different path. His courage puts me to shame," Elder Jian finally said, his evaluation of the "Sword Demon Secret Canon" vastly different from Elder Su's.

Noticing Li Yuanba's inquisitive look, Elder Jian smiled and explained:

"In ancient times, sword cultivators were divided into two factions—close-combat and long-range flying swords. As spell cultivators rose to prominence, close-combat sword cultivators were reduced to mere shields, which contradicted the essence of sword cultivation. Thus, their numbers dwindled, and most of their legacies were lost."

"The creator of the 'Sword Demon Secret Canon' was clearly a close-combat sword cultivator who sought to restore their former glory by tempering the sword cultivator's body early on. Unfortunately, this technique only goes up to the Golden Core stage. For some reason, its creator stopped innovating and left it incomplete."

Elder Jian suspected the reason—the creator had likely perished at the Golden Core stage, never reaching Nascent Soul, let alone creating a Nascent Soul-level "Sword Demon Secret Canon."

Even the Golden Core portion of the "Sword Demon Secret Canon" had devolved into methods for crafting and enhancing magic treasures, losing its earlier brilliance.

In his mind's eye, Elder Jian saw the trajectory of a genius sword cultivator—from dazzling radiance to mediocrity, and finally, to oblivion.

"But it's strange—why would practicing the 'Sword Demon Secret Canon' produce an aura of death?" Elder Jian scrutinized the technique repeatedly but couldn't identify the source.

Assuming it was some anomaly in Li Yuanba's cultivation, he checked the young man's body again. Since the death aura didn't seem to affect his cultivation, Elder Jian let the matter rest.

"Come with me," Elder Jian said, leading Li Yuanba out of the mission hall. The two then transformed into streaks of sword light and departed.

Elder Jian slowed his sword light as they approached a mountain shrouded in countless sword intents—so dense that merely nearing it felt like being cut.

"That's the sect's Ten Thousand Swords Peak, where my cave abode is located," Elder Jian explained casually.

As they descended, the sword intents parted to create a path for them.

The moment they entered the sword intent-laden mountain, Li Yuanba felt the sword intent within him stirring, resonating with the external sword intents.

"The Senluo Sect stole the Ten Thousand Swords Peak—it was originally the main peak of a mid-sized sword cultivator sect, brought back by several ancestors," Elder Jian recounted.

Li Yuanba couldn't fathom how such a mountain could have been relocated. Moreover, a sword cultivator sect capable of possessing such a peak must have been formidable—yet even their foundation had been plundered. Truly befitting a demonic sect.

"Master, are there few sword cultivators in the sect?" Li Yuanba asked, noticing the absence of other sword cultivator auras on the peak.

"Only we are true sword cultivators. The others have strayed from the path—they don't come here," Elder Jian replied, shaking his head.

As the Senluo Sect grew more powerful, its techniques and resources multiplied. With ample access to cultivator corpses—usable for corpse refinement, soul extraction, blood essence refinement, and other forbidden arts commonplace in demonic sects—fewer cultivators bothered with difficult-to-master techniques.

Of course, Elder Jian's reluctance to nurture sword cultivators also played a role. As the master of Ten Thousand Swords Peak, he rarely opened it to others, making it hard for sect members to utilize its sword intent-enhancing properties.

When Li Yuanba got a clear view of the peak, he understood its name.

Ten Thousand Swords Peak was littered with broken swords of all kinds—mostly at the magical artifact level, though spirit artifact-grade swords were interspersed throughout.

Upon landing at the summit, Li Yuanba even spotted five flying swords exuding magic treasure auras embedded in the rock.

Despite his main body possessing a flying sword magic treasure, the sight of five such treasures still stirred an urge in him to claim one.

"Don't bother looking. Every sword on this peak has become one with the mountain. None can be removed, let alone taken away. These five flying sword magic treasures are the peak's guardian treasures—utterly immovable," Elder Jian said, amused by Li Yuanba's reaction.

Elder Jian had deliberately shown Li Yuanba the peak to broaden his horizons. After the general introduction, he led the young man to his cave abode.

"I've looked into your background. The sect couldn't trace your origins. From what you've said, I gather you're from the Tianhai Islands—not a native of Northern Shu," Elder Jian remarked casually from his seat in the main hall.

Li Yuanba knew his fabricated background wouldn't hold up to scrutiny—this body had no real history.

"Don't worry. I'm not concerned about your origins—I'm not a native either," Elder Jian said, waving a hand dismissively when he noticed Li Yuanba's unease.

"You're a principled child. I investigated your activities since joining the sect—you haven't learned any of the sect's demonic techniques, focusing solely on cultivation and honing your sword intent. Do you wear that mask because you refuse to conform?" Elder Jian continued.

Li Yuanba was startled. That wasn't the case at all. While he did wear a mask, it wasn't out of dissatisfaction with the sect.

Besides, cultivators could identify each other by their auras, making facial concealment irrelevant for daily interactions.

"The reason I chose you as my disciple is precisely because of your purity. There are no pure sword cultivators left in the sect. My successor must be a pure sword cultivator," Elder Jian declared solemnly.

Suddenly, Li Yuanba didn't want to explain further. He resolved to keep Jiang Chen well-hidden—if Elder Jian discovered the corpse puppet, he might change his mind.

Li Yuanba wasn't a pure sword cultivator at all. While striving to become one, he also maintained a powerful corpse puppet as his ultimate trump card.

To traditional sword cultivators, such methods were impure.

But Li Yuanba believed survival was paramount—a living sword cultivator was a good sword cultivator.

As for the mask, the reason was simple: his face was too striking, enough to cause problems if left uncovered.

"Master, I wear the mask out of necessity," he said, removing it to explain.

Elder Jian was momentarily taken aback by Li Yuanba's appearance before bursting into laughter.

"Keep the mask on. That face of yours could save your life in battle—though beware of the sect's dual cultivation practitioners too," Elder Jian advised between chuckles.
