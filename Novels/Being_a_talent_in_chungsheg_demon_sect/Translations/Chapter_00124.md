# Chapter 124: The Desperate Struggle of the Daoist Court

On another desolate expanse of the World-Heaven Battlefield.

Originally, according to the agreement between the Daoist Court and the Pure Land, the Daoist Court should have detected the Pure Land's distress as soon as it was attacked and quickly sent reinforcements.

However, the Daoist Court never showed up from beginning to end.

This was because, just as the Pure Land cultivators were being ambushed by the Saint Sect, the Daoist Court also encountered unexpected major trouble and fell into a bitter struggle.

Above the wilderness, a colossal city floated in the air.

This treasure, similar to the Pure Land's Terrain Ship, was a specially crafted magic treasure. However, at this moment, this great city was enveloped by a black cloud.

The black cloud pressed down, threatening to crush the city. Wherever it passed, a buzzing sound of insects was incessant. As the insects landed on the city's protective barrier of treasure light, they emitted a sharp, hair-raising screech. With the passage of time, the city had been gnawed to pieces by the swarm, and many of the Daoist Court's cultivators had been devoured.

"What exactly are these worms!?"

"Divine abilities, magic treasures, nothing works on them!"

"Hold the line!"

A Daoist Court cultivator stood at the very front line, but due to excessive spiritual energy consumption, he was momentarily overwhelmed. A demonic worm burrowed into his mouth and nostrils, instantly freezing him in place.

A moment later, the Daoist Court cultivator collapsed with a thud.

Looking again, where was the human form? All that remained was an empty, blood-stained skin and hundreds of demonic worms multiplying and flying everywhere!

This was the terrifying nature of the Qi-devouring worms.

Impervious to blades and fire, invulnerable to water, they could also devour spiritual energy. Whether it was divine abilities or magic treasures, everything was within their diet, within their range of consumption!

On the entire battlefield, only one position held steady.

There was only one cultivator there, a tall woman with heroic bearing, surrounded by sword light. Wherever she passed, large swathes of demonic worms were instantly destroyed.

"It still has to be the Sword Pavilion..."

Deep within the city, Wang Jinting, the Daoist Court's leader this time, couldn't help but sigh, "The Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion's Ultimate Sword Divine Ability truly lives up to its reputation."

"Unfortunately, she is but one person... As things stand, we can only abandon 'Void Heaven City'!"

Thinking this, Wang Jinting glanced again at the Omniscient World Map in his hand, his expression grim.

"The Pure Land... is gone!?"

The Omniscient World Map could survey the entire realm. As long as someone was within this minor realm, it was impossible for them to escape the search of this Fruition Treasure.

Unless they were already dead.

Yet now, Wang Jinting discovered that the light points representing the Pure Land cultivators, originally gathered together on the map, had almost entirely vanished in an instant!

Instead, there were a large number of Initial Saint Sect disciples!

"The Initial Saint Sect... how is that possible?"

Wang Jinting found it hard to imagine. Hadn't most of the Initial Saint Demonic cultivators been besieged and killed by them? Unless a True Monarch had descended from the heavens, how could they possibly defeat the Pure Land?

"If I had known this, I shouldn't have ignored these worms back then." Thinking this, Wang Jinting felt a pang of regret. With the Omniscient World Map, he actually had the opportunity to get ahead of everyone, find the Qi-devouring Worm King, slay it, seize its Heavenly Fate, and thus achieve victory.

However, this Dao Contention War was a joint effort by the Daoist Court and the Pure Land to suppress the demonic path.

In this situation, victory was only one aspect; more importantly, the primary mission was to kill as many Saint Sect disciples as possible, especially the True Disciples!

For this purpose, he had previously ignored the natives of the minor realm.

As a result, these natives took advantage of the time to rapidly grow under the nourishment of the realm, to the point where they now formed a formidable, unstoppable force!

Furthermore, the defeat on the Pure Land's side made him extremely uneasy.

"...Retreat first!"

Thinking this, Wang Jinting finally made the decision to withdraw. He was about to activate the Omniscient World Map to transfer the Daoist Court cultivators out.

However, just then, shouts from disciples suddenly came from outside.

"It stopped... it stopped!"

"These worms aren't attacking anymore?"

"What's going on?"

The voices made Wang Jinting pause his actions, a look of confusion on his face. The next second, a vast spiritual sense pierced through layers of obstacles and landed before him.

"...Outsider."

Feeling the immense spiritual sense, Wang Jinting's pupils contracted sharply, and he instinctively took a step back. Then, understanding dawned on him: "You are the Worm King of these demonic worms?"

"Precisely."

Perhaps because it had devoured many cultivators, the Qi-devouring Worm King had begun to develop sentience and its speech was gradually becoming more fluent:

"I have eaten your people. You and another group of people do not seem to be allied. I saw many of you pursuing that other group. If that is the case, you must know there is an invincible existence among them. I need detailed information about him."

"Ah?"

Upon hearing the Worm King's words, Wang Jinting was stunned for a moment before realizing that the "other group" the Worm King referred to must be the Initial Saint Demonic cultivators.

There was an invincible existence among the Initial Saint Demonic cultivators?

How could that be!

Wang Jinting had personally experienced the terror of the Qi-devouring worms; their numbers and quality were impeccable. It was almost impossible for a Qi Refining cultivator to deal with them...

"...Foundation Establishment!?"

In an instant, Wang Jinting felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave, followed by a torrent of curses: A Dao Contention War for Qi Refining disciples, and they actually sent a Foundation Establishment True Monarch to participate?

Monsters!

Yet, even so, Wang Jinting did not give up. The next second, he raised his head to look at the Worm King's spiritual sense, a thought emerging in his mind.

—There was still hope! He could still manipulate this!

If the natives of this minor realm could utilize the power of these demonic worms, they might not be without a chance to win, or at least secure a draw!

Thinking this, Wang Jinting finally spoke:

"I can give you information about that person's location, ensuring he can't find you. However, I also have a request... you must help me deal with that group of people."

"How about we cooperate?"

"After all, you want to deal with them, and I also want to deal with them. We should be on the same side."

"And as long as those people are killed, you won't need to tell us, we will leave this place..."

In an instant, Wang Jinting's思路 (train of thought) cleared up.

"I don't believe the opponent can truly be a Foundation Establishment cultivator without flaws. At the very least, there should be weaknesses, such as stamina, preventing them from maintaining combat power for extended periods."

"Regardless, we must first test them... These demonic worms are undoubtedly the best method for testing. Their numbers are immense, and they aren't afraid of death. Sending them to the front will surely test the depths of that Initial Saint Sect Foundation Establishment True Monarch, and then we can formulate tactics based on the situation."

"As long as I hide and do not show myself, it won't count as a loss!"

"At this moment, the Daoist Court must be thinking this."

The Myriad Spirit Banner fluttered, and Lu Yang sat opposite Patriarch Tingyou. Patriarch Tingyou calmly analyzed the situation, and Lu Yang showed his agreement.

"Cooperating with the Qi-devouring worms and using human wave tactics to exhaust me... I would do the same."

Although Su Nv, after Patriarch Tingyou's improvements, currently had no flaws, no matter how many Qi-devouring worms came at this level, it would be futile.

However, if the opponent kept hiding in the dark and only sent worm swarms to their deaths, it would still be quite troublesome.

At the very least, it would be a prolonged war of attrition.

And if it dragged on for too long, who knew if the Qi-devouring Worm King, as the Child of Destiny of this minor realm, would grow to a level he couldn't handle.

Therefore, a swift victory was necessary.

To achieve a swift victory, he needed to either find the cultivator in the Daoist Court faction who held a Fruition Treasure, or kill the Qi-devouring Worm King, the Child of Destiny among the worms.

Thinking this, Lu Yang tried to perform a divination.

A moment later, he released his hand and shook his head, "No, the opponent holds a Fruition Treasure, so their karma is obscured. I cannot divine their specific location."

Just then, a voice suddenly came:

"True Monarch... are you looking for someone?"

Lu Yang turned at the sound, only to see Bi Feiyuan, the True Disciple of the Saint Sect, dressed in light gauze, smiling charmingly, "Perhaps we can help."
