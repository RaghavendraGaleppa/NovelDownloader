# Chapter 662: False Position of the Golden Core

Xu Yunfan's voice was calm. "Finally, you've shown yourself, True Lord. Your patience is truly remarkable."

Qingyuan True Lord's face was still pale from the bitter battles in the Aitila Great Realm. Upon hearing these words, his pupils contracted violently. He immediately attempted to withdraw his magical power, but it seemed a bit too late.

In Xu Yunfan's eyes, the most human emotions instantly faded away, leaving only an extreme, crystalline coldness.

"Lin."

The supreme secret transmission of the Wansheng Sword Sect, the "Lin" character mantra, erupted silently from the depths of his spiritual sea.

*The Supreme is passionless; only the Dao consciousness remains!*

At this moment, Xu Yunfan completely stepped into the "Lin State." It was a state he had only used a few times since entering the Taihua Spirit Void Realm.

The seven emotions and six desires returned to silence, his humanity vanished, and divinity naturally arose.

All things in the world shed their colorful appearances in his eyes, transforming into structures woven from pure threads. Flesh, blood, bones, surging magical power, the DanTian cave-heaven, the垂落 of the Divine霄 Dao Fruit, and the Qingyuan True Lord's attacking Immortal Palace Clear Qi... everything seemed to turn into another form of cognition.

Under this absolute rationality and control, his control over his own magical power reached a microscopic level of atomic precision. The trajectory of every wisp of Divine霄 Thunder was clearly reflected in his mind, with losses reduced to an unbelievable minimum.

His control over his physical body reached perfection. Every bit of power within the Divine霄 Immortal Indestructible Body was perfectly coordinated and mobilized, with no further dissipation.

The deduction of the battle situation was like the operation of a cold star track. The trajectory locked by Qingyuan True Lord's Immortal Palace Clear Qi, the nodes of power changes, and even the stagnation points in his magical power operation due to crossing realms and previous great battles were all clearly visible, like observing the lines on his palm.

His thinking speed pushed to its peak, and the flow of time in the outside world seemed to be infinitely stretched.

Just as the "Lin State" descended, Xu Yunfan's mind was like lightning. Without the slightest hesitation, he crushed the Moon Wheel Treasure Mirror, which was deeply hidden in the core of his DanTian cave-heaven and had been painstakingly refined.

"Crack!"

The crisp shattering sound seemed to echo only in the depths of Xu Yunfan's soul.

The core essence of the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit from the Heavenly Realm, sealed within the mirror, erupted violently.

In an instant, a vast and mighty force swept through Xu Yunfan's entire body.

This was the artifact refinement attainment he had cultivated using the *Xuandu Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Script*. He had forcibly refined it into a disposable vessel to falsely hold the Golden Core position. Now was the time.

*Hum!*

The aura around Xu Yunfan, like a dormant volcano of ten thousand years, suddenly erupted. It soared from the limit of the Foundation Establishment realm, which was originally infinitely close to the Golden Core but not quite there, to an infinite height.

A vast pressure spread out like a tangible tide, even briefly shaking the pillar of lightning that hung from the Divine霄 Dao Fruit.

The might of the Golden Core was achieved through false holding.

A higher-dimensional perspective descended upon him.

At the moment of falsely holding the Golden Core position, combined with the absolute rationality of the Lin State, Xu Yunfan's cognition of all things in the world underwent a complete transformation.

The laws of heaven and earth were no longer unfathomable scriptures but transformed into a clear, visible, and crisscrossing three-dimensional network.

He seemed to stand on the edge of a giant chessboard, overlooking the trembling and connections of every "line" within it.

The layers of space were exceptionally clear. He could see the fine ripples in the spatial structure when Qingyuan True Lord's Immortal Palace Clear Qi pierced through the void.

The essence of matter was penetrated. Rocks, grass, and trees decomposed in his eyes into more fundamental combinations of particles and energy fluctuations.

The flow of time also seemed to present multi-dimensional trajectories. Causal fragments from a certain moment in the past and several possible evolutionary branches of the future flashed through his cold spiritual sense.

Qingyuan True Lord's seemingly boundless Immortal Palace Clear Qi now revealed its subtle and weak nodes in his eyes.

The vast will descending from the Divine霄 Dao Fruit was more like a brilliant core, meticulously constructed from countless thunder law runes.

This perspective was truly that of a Golden Core True Lord—a fleeting glimpse of the underlying rules of the world.

"What a waste of a heavenly treasure!!"

Qingyuan True Lord was both shocked and furious.

It wasn't just him. Within the entire Taihua Spirit Void Realm, any True Lord who had reached the Golden Core realm was watching everything happening in the Eastern Wilderness, either openly or secretly.

When Xu Yunfan forcibly refined a Dao Fruit into such a thing, many people were so heartbroken they slapped their thighs.

Especially Pudu True Lord at the boundary of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land. When he saw Xu Yunfan take out the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit and refine it into a disposable item, the corners of his eyes twitched slightly. He was contemplating whether to have the Great Awakening Bodhisattva go to the Eastern Wilderness to check on the situation.

In the center of the Eastern Wilderness, Qingyuan True Lord never imagined that Xu Yunfan would be willing to refine a complete Dao Fruit—one that would make any True Lord envious—into a disposable consumable.

This was simply a waste of a heavenly treasure.

What shocked him even more was that the other party had truly used it to temporarily step into the Golden Core realm, and his aura was still climbing!

The method of cultivating a false Golden Core position was enough to show that Xu Yunfan's attainments in artifact refinement were truly masterful.

Xu Yunfan would not waste this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for insight and this explosive power.

Under the "Lin State," his heart was like an ice mirror, without a single ripple.

His three great innate supernatural powers, under the加持 of the might of the false Golden Core, operated with unprecedented ferocity to their peak.

Martial Dao Heavenly Eye, the Dou Character Mantra, and the North Pole Purple Weigh Suppressing Evil Primordial Qi.

The three overlaid, and his Golden Core aura wildly climbed. In the span of a single breath, it crossed the threshold of the initial Golden Core stage and pressed right up to the edge of the mid Golden Core stage.

Qingyuan True Lord, who saw Xu Yunfan's instantaneous transformation, felt his heart and liver tremble. He suddenly felt that his appearance was a bit ill-timed.

Xu Yunfan had been waiting for him to make a move.

***

Wansheng Sword Sect, Tian Shu Peak.

Lu Chunyang, seated cross-legged atop the peak of the sea of clouds, was closing his eyes and resting. He felt a slight relief as he sensed that the several True Lords of the Wansheng Sword Sect had quieted down and the Cangming Dao Fruit had returned to its place.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes wide. Two tangible sword lights pierced through the void, looking afar toward the direction of the Eastern Wilderness.

"Lin Character Mantra?!"

For the first time, a look of astonishment appeared on his unflappable face. The depths of his eyes, which could penetrate ten thousand realms, reflected Xu Yunfan's cold and emotionless state.

"He has actually cultivated this technique to such a realm, and this power, Golden Core? No!"

With his discernment, he instantly saw through that the essence of the Golden Core position was a false grasp of the Taiyin Dao Fruit. However, the might Xu Yunfan displayed at this moment and the depth of his use of the Lin Character Mantra still shook this leader of the Wansheng Sword Sect's swordsmanship.

"This kid hides even deeper than I imagined. What a desperate move!"

A smile couldn't help but appear on Lu Chunyang's face.

"Lin Character Mantra?!"

A voice of shock and anger rang out beside him. The voice of the North Pole Peak's Eternal Heavenly Light Proof Dao True Lord, filled with anger and frustration, sounded in Lu Chunyang's ear.

"Dao Master Lu, even if you dote on your Dao Sect's disciple, there's no need to pass this mantra on to him, right? This is a technique left behind by my Wansheng Sword Sect's Dao Master."

Lu Chunyang didn't even lift his eyelids.

"I have never even learned the Lin Character Mantra myself. How could I have taught it?"

With that, he raised his head to look at Tian Ji Peak and said leisurely, "I remember that True Lord Xuan Shu Jianpo Tongxuan, under his command, has a disciple named Yu Congling. A thousand years ago, she entered the Shenwu Realm to compete for the Shenwu Dao Fruit. I suppose this technique flowed out from there."

(There will be more later; I'll write it all out tonight.)
