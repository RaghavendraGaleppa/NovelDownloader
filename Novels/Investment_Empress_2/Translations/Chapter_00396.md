Chapter 396: The Ice Cube Fights Two, A Warning

Under the bright sun and clear sky.

"?"

Li Mo was passively pushed behind Ying Bing.

Strictly speaking, it was the Ice Cube who stood in front of him. The small hand that was just in his palm was now holding a sword. He opened his mouth to speak, but he saw the frost and snow in her eyes, her jade-like face incredibly cold.

He suddenly remembered when he had backed Xiao Jiang up yesterday.

The Ice Cube was backing him up now.

So Li Mo let go of Si Shi. Since the Ice Cube was standing up for him, how could he not trust her?

"..."

Dan Hong and Qing Que, along with the elite troops they had brought, fell silent for a moment.

Observing the Divine Strike to perceive the Inner Scene?

Those at the forefront of the Hidden Dragon List could indeed do this, but weren't the two of them also once on the Hidden Dragon List? Moreover, she was facing two opponents at once!

"Hehe, Fairy Han... let's see how worthy you are of that title!"

Dan Hong narrowed her eyes. She hated that kind of gaze the most; it reminded her of the woman who had suppressed her master back then, Jiang Chulong's mother.

She suddenly made her move, her Inner Scene domain erupting.

"Be careful!" Qing Que shouted loudly.

She felt it.

Ying Bing's fair, slender five fingers held the玄兵 sword casually, yet a soaring sword intent was brewing within.

Once she drew her sword, it would surely be earth-shattering!

But Dan Hong was arrogant by nature, thinking that since their realms were like a chasm between them, as long as she went all out, the other party would have no power to fight back.

A river of stars hung upside down in the sky, its domineering sword intent sweeping down overwhelmingly.

The strength of this sword lay in its vastness and grandeur.

An ordinary Divine Strike cultivator, facing the condensed might of this sword technique, would probably be too scared to even draw their sword. This was the suppression of the Inner Scene over the Divine Strike level on a spiritual level.

Of course, this was nothing to Ying Bing, who possessed two Divine Intents, both of which were Great Path Divine Forms.

In this world, besides the future Jiang Chulong and that Sword God who has passed away and may no longer exist, who could claim to be more vast and grand than Ying Bing?

Ying Bing, shrouded in moonlight, moved. The sword she had been accumulating power for finally erupted.

It was also a sword intent like a galloping river!

"The River of Stars Sword Art has a decent concept, but you will never be able to perfect it."

A voice as cold as jade came from within the sword intent.

The sword intent pierced the heavens. Besides the flowing river, it now possessed a sense of inclusiveness and convergence.

It fused the various Divine Intents she had absorbed from the Jade Phoenix God, intertwining them within.

"!"

Li Mo widened his eyes, utterly shocked.

When did the Ice Cube learn the first move of the fighting king's manual?

And she used it so naturally and skillfully...

As expected, Dan Hong was enraged. Her mind stirred, and her domain fluctuated slightly. This wasn't really a flaw; after a technical adjustment, it would be almost unnoticeable...

But her opponent was Ying Bing.

The sword intent suddenly surged, seizing that infinitesimal fluctuation in an instant, ruthlessly tearing it open and expanding it into a gap.

A flaw appeared.

Ying Bing rode a dazzling, unimaginable sword light, charging right up to Dan Hong. The afterimage of her sword-wielding form had only just begun to fade.

So fast!

Dan Hong's pupils constricted sharply.

However, right around the sword intent that seemed destined to strike, layers of nets suddenly appeared, as if any sword light, sword intent, or sword momentum was being enveloped by them. No matter which direction it charged, it was just like a headless fly darting around aimlessly.

Sword Weaving Art.

This sword technique seemed to make the various sword intents and sword qi in Ying Bing's river of stars fall apart, then scatter like a school of frenzied fish, before finally being caught in a single net.

This sword also made up for the flaws and shortcomings in Dan Hong's domain, leaving her with no more worries.

"I think I heard the elders mention it in the Sword Tower of Sword City."

Li Mo remembered. Elder Zeng, who loved reading *The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me*, had spoken of this sword art with both regret and gritted teeth.

Elder Zeng said this sword art was too calculating, too thoughtful; it was a sword of extreme intelligence that inevitably leads to self-harm.

After this sword art appeared, the Hengyun Sword City weakened and was suppressed by the Tianshan Sword Manor from then on.

However, compared to Ming Hui...

Ying Bing's身后 was shrouded in layers of moon shadows. Her sword was like a bright light, her form unmoving, yet her body seemed to be veiled in a light gauze of moonlight, becoming hazy and indistinct.

For a time, her form vanished into the moon shadows.

But her sword was especially resolute! Pointing straight at Dan Hong's glabella, it was like a solemn death warrant, drawing ever closer to its target!

Dan Hong's eyes widened.

---

In that instant, she was looked down upon, meeting those eyes.

Cold, transcendent, and unfathomable.

Like a fairy descending from the moon, glancing at a mortal by chance, freezing one's soul and spirit, leaving one in a daze.

She... would really kill me with a single sword stroke.

She didn't care at all who I am.

*Hum—*

The sword tip stopped just a finger's width from her glabella. It felt as if one could feel the cold, god-like sword edge, and a trace of sword intent had already leaked out despite being restrained.

A shallow bloodstain was carved on Dan Hong's glabella, a drop of blood flowing out, splitting her face.

She collapsed to her knees, powerless, as if her soul had been lost.

"..."

Li Mo felt a sudden realization and clicked his tongue in secret.

The Ice Cube has gotten so much stronger!

If she also had a divine weapon and sparred with him, it would be hard to say who would win...

Dan Hong didn't seem to be seriously injured, just a broken skin, but...

"You! You crippled her!"

Qing Que, who had always been expressionless, finally showed a hint of anger.

The Ice Cube could have said it was the other party's sword heart that was fragile, her state of mind unstable, and had nothing to do with her. She had even shown mercy.

But Ying Bing glanced at Li Mo's handsome face, then looked seriously at the woman in green:

"She got off cheap."

Qing Que was choked, her anger extinguished by the coldness in Ying Bing's eyes, and a sense of powerlessness rose in her heart.

After a long silence, the太子's sword maid spoke:

"His Highness has a message for you."

"Stop teaching the little princess martial arts, otherwise he will surely kill you."

"Regarding what happened before, His Highness will let it slide. It can be offset with the contributions you made in the Southern Frontier. Moreover, he is willing to remind you, which shows he values your talent. You should behave yourself..."

"That's clearly not just one sentence," Li Mo said seriously, with the same cold demeanor as the Ice Cube.

Qing Que: "...The last part was my own advice."

With that, she ordered her men to help the soulless Dan Hong up and turned to leave. They arrived with great fanfare but left without taking a single cloud with them.

Only then did the elders of the Qingyuan Sect come down.

Watching Qing Que and the太子's entourage leave, the elders looked bewildered, as if saying, 'I haven't gotten on the car yet' and 'What the hell happened?'

Didn't Ouyang just say there was a conflict?

Where was the conflict?

Why did they leave?

"Weren't they supposed to fight?" Elder Qian asked.

Li Mo coughed lightly: "It's over."

"Oh..."

The elders heaved a sigh of relief.

"Ying Bing observed the Divine Strike to perceive the Inner Scene, fighting two alone."

"Hah?"

The hearts of the elders, which had just settled, rose again.

"It's fine, she won."

"Oh..."

It was quite unbelievable, but which of them hadn't been shocked to the point of doubting their lives by Little Bing'er?

They had developed a certain level of immunity and were no longer easily shocked.

"But..."

"Stop with the 'buts'! Just say it all in one breath, Xiao Mo! My heart is about to fail!"

Xue Jing's heart was pounding up and down; he almost lost several years of his life.

Li Mo nodded:

"The Ice Cube accidentally... it seems like she... probably... maybe... crippled the太子's sword maid."

"?"

"The kind where her sword heart is shattered."

"???"

The Qingyuan Sect was destined to be a sleepless night.

The elders couldn't sleep; even in the middle of the night, they would be startled awake from a near-death experience.
