# Chapter 10: The Unseen Zone

The field rows were meticulously arranged, the crops from their stems to their leaves, and then to their grain heads, all gleaming brightly, like golden ornaments, strikingly conspicuous in the dark depths of the mountains, shrouded in a mysterious aura.

Everyone present was captivated by Feng Yi'an's words. Such a peculiar sight in the thick night mist of the great mountain?

"Who's cultivating them?" Xu Yueping asked.

Feng Yi'an shook his head. The mountain patrolmen who had gotten lost previously stumbled upon the place but didn't dare to approach. They immediately reported it afterward, and high-ranking officials personally came, but they couldn't find it at all.

Old Liu, aged over seventy, sighed, "The night is boundless, and there are too many unknown things in the deep mountains and vast swamps. The vast uninhabited zones are extremely dangerous; even the City Lord from afar would find it difficult to venture deep."

"Grandpa Liu, have you also encountered some strange things?" Qin Ming asked.

Old Liu nodded, a look of reminiscence on his face. "Not just in the wilderness, even near our dwelling place, there are oddities." He recalled being a boy, flying a kite with friends at the village entrance. When reeling in the line, he found it sticky, and there was blood on the kite.

"Right at our village entrance?" Yang Yongqing was startled, unable to resist glancing towards the night sky outside the window.

Qin Ming hesitated, then asked, "Could it have been a bird that got injured and then hit the kite?"

"Perhaps," Old Liu said, "My grandpa's face changed immediately when he saw the blood-stained kite string back then. He told me to keep it a secret, and decades have passed in a flash."

Such an incident happening right at one's doorstep always made people feel uneasy.

Xu Yueping said, "Let Brother Feng tell us more about things in the mountains."

"Have you ever heard of mountain beasts mourning at a grave?" Feng Yi'an asked, a hint of caution and reverence in his voice, his expression very complex.

"Mourning at what kind of grave?" someone asked. They had traversed the mountains for years but had never encountered such a thing.

Feng Yi'an replied, "A beast's grave."

"Do wild beasts also practice earth burial?" Xu Yueping was astonished.

Feng Yi'an nodded. "The uninhabited zone covered by night mist inspires awe; anything bizarre can happen." That day, the old team leader of the mountain patrol discovered an anomaly in the mountain. Fearing that a mysterious being might further evolve and cause disaster, he quietly approached.

"The old team leader wanted to get firsthand information, to see what kind of 'unusual creature' or 'noteworthy beast' was improving itself, so we could prevent it and counterattack precisely." This was because mutated beings each possessed different abilities, requiring varied measures and means to deal with them.

The old team leader suddenly realized on the way that the abnormal movement was actually a sobbing sound, but he didn't stop. He then saw a white-furred old beast wailing softly, mourning at a grave in the night, which was extremely chilling.

Feng Yi'an said, "That dilapidated earthen grave must have existed for at least a thousand years, because the ancient cypress growing on it has lived for at least a millennium." The old team leader saw the white-furred mountain beast kowtowing like a human, and a rain of light even fell near the earthen grave, illuminating the dark mountain forest. Afterward, fierce raptors descended from the night sky, and monsters emerged from the swamp, all joining in the worship.

At this point, Feng Yi'an paused.

"What happened then?" someone urged.

Feng Yi'an said, "The old team leader risked approaching to see the white-furred mountain beast's true appearance, preparing to go back and check if there were any local records, thereby taking targeted precautions." The white-furred old beast kowtowed and shed tears, then inexplicably began to mutate. Mourning at the grave seemed to be a mysterious ritual that elevated its life level.

The old team leader quietly retreated, but on the way, he began coughing blood and his whole body itched. Although he returned alive and reported what he saw, he himself died from decaying flesh.

"The higher-ups dispatched a large force, entering the mountain for a great battle. It's said that luckily, the message was delivered in time; otherwise, if the white-furred old beast had fully developed its power, there would have been a great catastrophe."

Everyone's hearts felt heavy. Outside the mountain, it was usually peaceful, but in the unseen places, there were hidden truths, with people silently guarding the mountain and fighting.

Old Liu, with his white hair and wrinkled face, sighed, "There's more than just one or two cases like the old team leader. A close friend I made in my youth constantly guarded the mountain, blocking dangerous anomalous beings. Eventually, he grew old, and I don't know if he died in the mountain, but he never appeared again."

Feng Yi'an nodded. "Most of our mountain patrol team members have suffered severe injuries, and some have met tragic ends, not even leaving behind their bones." He used the old team leader's master as an example: "Back then, that senior was incredibly skilled and highly respected. He had already honorably retired due to losing an arm, but then he heard that a dangerous mountain monster had appeared. Fearing that the younger generation couldn't stop it and wanting to prevent others from dying in vain, he dragged his crippled body and went to fight it himself."

After a battle, although the old team leader's master severely wounded the mountain monster, he himself died tragically. Besides large patches of blood, only half a blade remained. "That senior's greatest wish during his lifetime was to be buried outside the mountain, alongside his deceased wife and children. But his wish went unfulfilled; his soul could not return, left in the dark mountains," Feng Yi'an shook his head and sighed. The old man's wife and children had died prematurely due to a mountain monster's rampage back then, and he remained unmarried for the rest of his life. The mountain patrol team brought his blood-stained broken blade back and buried it beside his wife and children's grave.

Qin Ming, hearing all this, felt that even the strong old wine had lost its flavor and remained silent.

Feng Yi'an's spirits were low. "In the end, besides the injured and the dead, some mountain patrolmen go mad and remain in the great mountains, eating bloody, hairy raw meat like wild beasts, transforming into out-and-out monsters. Alas, we don't know what our final fate will be; perhaps the great mountain is our final resting place."

The atmosphere at the dinner table was somewhat somber. With changes now occurring in the mountains, a mountain sweep might be imminent, and no one knew what would happen next.

Feng Yi'an drank the wine in his cup in one gulp, saying, "Brother Xu, I'll still have to trouble you to plant the medicinal seeds." He solemnly took a wooden box from his bosom. Opening it, there were four black seeds inside, about the size of kidney beans.

Xu Yueping was startled. "Plant them in winter?"

Feng Yi'an's expression was grave. "If placed in the fire springs to be nourished now, they will grow vigorously by early spring. Our mountain patrol team will definitely be at the forefront of this battle. Some brothers' lives are likely counting down; even if they survive, they might be half-crippled. We don't know if they can endure until the 'Black Moon' grows mature. This is a life-saving medicine for many people, Old Xu, you must take it seriously!"

The Black Moon, rooted in the fire springs, had leaves like orchids. When its full buds bloomed, each petal was like a black crescent moon, emitting dark light and entwined with white mist.

Feng Yi'an wiped a little wine from his large beard, stood up, and bid farewell. "Thank you for your hospitality, Brother Xu. If I can return alive after the mountain sweep, we shall gather again."

"Brother Feng is highly skilled; he will surely turn misfortune into fortune," Xu Yueping said.

Everyone present escorted Feng Yi'an to the village entrance, watching him disappear into the night.

"The year's circumstances aren't good, but the mountain patrol team is still considerate, only sending four seeds. The spiritual energy drawn from the fire springs can sustain them," someone remarked. Mountain patrolmen not only monitored dangers in the mountains but also guarded them, and all regions were willing to plant life-saving medicinal herbs for them, not resisting. According to the agreement, each village was to provide four to eight Black Moon plants annually; with only four, the impact on the crops in the fire fields wouldn't be too significant.

Everyone present dispersed.

Old Liu had not yet left, staring at the four black seeds. "They really cultivated them."

As Qin Ming left, he noticed Xu Yueping seemed preoccupied.

***

The streets had more people than usual, all carrying bows and arrows and hunting forks, preparing to enter the mountains. Yesterday, they had asked Qin Ming in detail about the conditions in the mountains, and this morning they began their operation. The main reason was that each household's grain storage was low, and food was scarce.

"Great harvest, we hunted two blade-horned deer!" A group of people returned with good news, having gained a bountiful harvest.

"Currently, the outer regions of the mountain forest are tending towards calmness. As long as you don't go deep, you can hunt cautiously."

The next day, more people went into the mountains together, bringing back many prey. Many children cheered, unafraid of the cold, exhaling white mist as they ran around the streets like it was New Year's, and the village atmosphere was noticeably better.

"Uncle, come to my house to try some fresh meat. We're eating musk deer today," Wen Rui happily called out to Qin Ming.

Qin Ming had eaten wild game. As he left Lu Ze's house, he saw Xu Yueping returning from the village entrance, frowning deeply.

"Uncle Xu, were you seeing someone off?"

"Yes, people from the mountain patrol team came and urged me to plant the Black Moon seeds," Xu Yueping said.

Qin Ming felt that the mountain patrolmen truly had it tough, facing all sorts of dangers, perhaps getting injured or even dying at any moment. Seeing Xu Yueping preoccupied and deeply frowning, he didn't say much more.

That day, the last group of people who had gone into the mountains returned, causing a commotion, as most were injured and bleeding, and all their prey was lost.

"That was close! We ran into a mutated snow ape. Old Chen's arm was almost torn off!" The villagers who escaped back were still terrified.

"It was a blessing in disguise; we forced it back with arrows and managed to escape." Having survived the ordeal, they said they had ventured too deep into the mountains this time and shouldn't be reckless again.

The thick night mist dispersed, and a new day dawned. Although some people were injured yesterday, it didn't scare off others, because this time, there were newly awakened individuals joining them.

However, not long after, one of the groups returned, many of them bleeding, and the newly awakened individual was the most severely injured. His left shoulder blade was shattered, one leg was bent unnaturally, his chest was partially caved in, and his mouth was full of bloody foam; it was uncertain if he would survive.

"What happened?"

"We encountered a blood bear!" someone said, trembling lips.

Blood bears were very powerful mutated creatures, with blood-colored fur, violent, and ferocious. Even newly awakened individuals might not survive encountering one.

"Where's Brother Lu?" Qin Ming quickly came to the adjacent courtyard.

"He went into the mountains." Liang Wanqing, upon learning the situation, immediately became anxious.

"I'm going to find him!" Qin Ming turned and left.

Xu Yueping learned that another group hadn't returned and immediately grew anxious, calling all newly awakened individuals to enter the mountain together.

Qin Ming ran at the very front, kicking up large waves of snow on both sides, startling Xu Yueping, who was closest to him, causing him to lose himself for a moment. As for the others, they were long since left far behind.

Approaching the forest, Qin Ming stopped, as a group of people were staggering out. He immediately saw Lu Ze, who was being carried out.

"Brother Lu!" he rushed over.

Lu Ze's face was as pale as gold paper, his eyes closed, his clothes tattered and stained with blood. His chest and abdomen were the most severely injured, with at least three broken ribs. Crying sounds came from nearby; two of the severely injured who were carried back had already passed away.

"Did the blood bear injure you?" Qin Ming asked.

Someone said with lingering fear, "Yes, if the mountain patrolmen hadn't appeared, many of us might have died."

Qin Ming stared at the dark mountain forest, drawing his gleaming short blade.

Xu Yueping arrived and stopped him. "Don't take risks, let's go back first!"

Liang Wanqing saw Lu Ze being carried back, her face turning ghastly pale with fright. She stumbled over, and her two children cried loudly.

"Sister-in-law, Brother Lu just fainted," Qin Ming said. He had carefully checked; Lu Ze's broken ribs had not pierced his internal organs. After Qin Ming reset them and treated the wounds, the problem was not very serious.

Many people were injured this time, and cries of old people and children could be heard even on the street. The village atmosphere was suppressed. Xu Yueping ordered that no one was allowed to enter the mountains from now on.

Qin Ming entered Xu Yueping's courtyard and found Old Liu and Yang Yongqing there.

"You want to go kill the blood bear?" Xu Yueping asked from inside the house.

Qin Ming's voice was not loud. "Although Lu Ze has wounds from bear claws, his broken ribs look more like they were hit by a fist."

"You have that feeling too? Then it's most likely man-made." Xu Yueping abruptly stood up, his face showing anger. "Some people are going too far!"

Qin Ming had sensed something earlier and had some suspicions. This was because Xu Yueping had been preoccupied ever since he received the four seeds.

"Why?" Qin Ming asked. Guessing was one thing, but emotionally, it was hard to accept.

Xu Yueping's voice was low. "The mountain patrol team forced me to plant the Black Moon seeds immediately, and I didn't agree. I didn't expect them to retaliate like this."

Old Liu said, "The seeds have problems. They must be mutated and will absorb a large amount of the fire springs' spiritual energy, affecting the farming in the fire fields. There might be a famine next year."

Qin Ming's emotions were unsettled. He thought Feng Yi'an, that big-bearded man, seemed very bold and had told some tragic stories of the mountain patrolmen, which had deeply moved him. Yet, they had done such a thing.

Yang Yongqing said, "What Feng Yi'an mentioned were all real events, but they have nothing to do with the main members of *this* current team!"

Qin Ming remembered his earlier words: "Some mountain patrolmen are very responsible." At the time, he felt that Yang Yongqing seemed to be implying that some were very irresponsible, expressing it very subtly.

Old Liu lowered his voice. "This team has hunted a blood bear before. I strongly suspect that someone is now wearing that bear skin and committing evil."

Upon hearing this, a surge of anger rose in Qin Ming's heart. Mountain patrolmen should be guarding the mountains and protecting their region, earning respect. But what were they doing? They appeared bold and responsible on the surface, but secretly they were committing evil, their hands stained with villagers' blood. Where was their conscience?

"Is Brother Xu home?" Feng Yi'an, leading four mountain patrolmen, walked into the courtyard.

"It's all our fault. We were derelict this time and failed to protect our fellow villagers." The big-bearded Feng Yi'an spoke with a look of guilt, stating that they would immediately go hunt down the blood bear.

Xu Yueping's knuckles, clenched inside his sleeves, turned white, but he couldn't erupt. He had to maintain a proper demeanor to deal with them. His heart was indescribably pained; they killed people and then came to apologize. This was simply riding on someone's neck, looking down and smiling derisively.

Qin Ming sat quietly, temporarily suppressing the urge to draw his blade.
