# Chapter 101: Senior Brother's Invitation

Zhang Jing paused his steps and turned around. Upon recognizing the approaching figure, a faint smile appeared on his face.

"Senior Brother Qiu, long time no see!" Zhang Jing greeted warmly. "I didn't expect to run into you right after entering the Sixth Void Heaven."

Opposite him, Qiu Xiuming looked at Zhang Jing with a trace of bewilderment. He had been observing Zhang Jing since his first attempt at climbing the Heavenly Staircase. That initial performance had shocked him—Zhang Jing had directly advanced to the Third Void Heaven in one go, becoming the top-ranked disciple across all outer courtyards by a significant margin.

What truly astonished Qiu Xiuming was the terrifying depth of Dao comprehension this achievement represented. He hadn't forgotten that their Pavilion Master and Chief still hoped Zhang Jing would switch to studying formation talismans. At the time, Qiu Xiuming had worried—what if Junior Brother Zhang Jing comprehended Dao Intent?

But Zhang Jing's performance over the next two months, which seemed almost like cheating, shattered all of Qiu Xiuming's concerns. Because that "what if" had come true!

However— Qiu Xiuming's expression suddenly turned peculiar. Even though he'd grown somewhat accustomed to this junior brother's monstrous talent over the past two months, wasn't it somewhat... impolite for a Qi Refining cultivator to appear in the Sixth Void Heaven in front of Foundation Establishment seniors like them?

Before long, Qiu Xiuming pointed to a well-built stone house. "Junior Brother, this will have to do. Remember, our main purpose in the Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven is hunting spirit demons to accumulate spiritual essence. These dwellings are just for resting and meditation when we're mentally exhausted."

"Thank you, Senior Brother. Having a stone house for shelter is more than I could ask for," Zhang Jing replied politely.

"I'm glad you don't mind," Qiu Xiuming said with a smile, then pointed to a smaller stone house nearby. "That's where I stay, Junior Brother. If you have any questions or need help with anything, don't hesitate to come find me. If I'm not there, just leave a spiritual mark on the interior wall—I'll come find you when I see it."

"Many thanks, Senior Brother."

Five days later, as dusk deepened and light began to fade...

In a stretch of wilderness shaded by eastern mountains, the gloom was suddenly illuminated by dazzling bursts of magical light. Violent spiritual fluctuations made the ground tremble faintly.

After several breaths, a fierce draconic roar echoed before the light vanished, leaving silence in its wake.

Zhang Jing communicated with the Dao pattern in his palm, a pleased expression appearing on his face.

[Spiritual Essence +3,500]
[Total Spiritual Essence: 428,500]

In just five days, he'd accumulated nearly 130,000 spiritual essence. This bountiful harvest came partly from the greater essence yielded by each spirit demon, and partly because the Sixth Void Heaven had been divided by the three major academies into hunting zones of varying sizes based on strength and numbers. With resources properly allocated, there were no situations of multiple cultivators fighting over the same group of demons.

Glancing at the darkening sky, Zhang Jing felt weariness creep over him. "Five days out already—time to return and recuperate," he thought, transforming into a streak of light that shot eastward.

Behind him, the thick green serpent demon's corpse lay twisted on the ravaged ground, slowly dissolving into motes of spiritual light.

That night, a gentle knock sounded at his door.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, are you there?" came Qiu Xiuming's voice.

Zhang Jing opened his eyes from meditation, a trace of curiosity appearing on his face. "Please come in, Senior Brother Qiu."

The wooden door opened to reveal Qiu Xiuming, who looked at Zhang Jing with an expression mixing complaint and admiration. "You're too intense, Junior Brother—hunting spirit demons for five straight days! I've been waiting two days to catch you back here."

"Just wandering around outside—forgive my poor manners," Zhang Jing replied with a smile before asking curiously, "Did you need something from me?"

"Indeed, and you returned just in time," Qiu Xiuming said seriously. "Junior Brother, Senior Brother Qi from the Spirit Dao Pavilion discovered a treasure spirit demon a few days ago. It's quite powerful and in a special location—he doesn't feel confident handling it alone, so he's gathering fellow disciples for assistance."

"Treasure spirit demon?" The unfamiliar term gave Zhang Jing pause before realization dawned. "So you want me to come along?" he asked thoughtfully.

Nodding, Qiu Xiuming explained, "This concerns a treasure spirit demon, and you've reached the seventh step of the Heavenly Staircase—placing you among the top-tier inner courtyard disciples in the Sixth Void Heaven. When Senior Brother Qi invited me, I naturally recommended you."

Before Zhang Jing could respond, Qiu Xiuming added, "By the way, Senior Brother Qi is offering two qian of Enlightenment Tea per person as compensation."

"Two qian of Enlightenment Tea? That's 200,000 spiritual essence!" Zhang Jing's eyes lit up. His senior brother truly looked out for him—this was the same person who had personally recruited him into the Thousand Methods Pavilion!

"In that case, I won't decline. Thank you for your consideration, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said gratefully.

"Don't mention it—I just made the introduction. Your strength is the main factor," Qiu Xiuming waved off the thanks. "We're gathering here at noon tomorrow—don't forget."

"Rest assured, Senior Brother."

At noon the next day, Zhang Jing emerged from his stone house in high spirits to find Qiu Xiuming and two others already waiting.

"Junior Brother Zhang, let me introduce you—this is Senior Brother Qi, and this is Senior Brother Meng," Qiu Xiuming said, pulling Zhang Jing forward.

Turning to the other two, he began, "Senior Brothers, this is—"

"Haha, Junior Brother Zhang Jing—the future Chief of Thousand Methods Pavilion! No introduction needed, we all know him," Senior Brother Qi interrupted with booming laughter.

"Greetings, Senior Brothers Qi and Meng. Your praise is too generous," Zhang Jing said modestly.

"Hello, Junior Brother Zhang Jing," the gentle-featured Senior Brother Meng responded with a nod. Though he'd seen Zhang Jing's records, seeing the youth's young face in person still sent waves of astonishment through him, complex emotions surfacing—admiration mixed with envy.

A mere Qi Refining cultivator without even a Dao Foundation, yet standing on the seventh step of the Heavenly Staircase in the Sixth Void Heaven just like himself. The depth of Dao Intent comprehension this implied was... terrifying.

In contrast, Senior Brother Meng hadn't even found the door to Dao Intent yet. The gap between them... A flash of dejection crossed his eyes.
