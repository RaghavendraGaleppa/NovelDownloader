# Chapter 472: Destruction and Rebirth

It was as if it were issuing an unyielding summons and declaration to the Imperial Star hanging high above fate itself!

*Rumble!*

High above the Nine Heavens, the originally faint and indistinct stellar trajectory suddenly erupted with a blinding light!

Like a sleeping emperor suddenly opening his eyes, the entire firmament trembled at this moment. The originally faint starlight transformed in an instant into a resplendent pillar of light that pierced through the cosmos. Its diameter reached a thousand zhang, illuminating the night sky of the Divine Martial World as if it were broad daylight.

At the core of the pillar, a deep violet brilliance so intense it seemed nearly solid churned continuously, as if containing the power of an entire galaxy's stars.

This was by no means an ordinary guiding light. The edges of the pillar twisted with a sharpness that made even him feel his scalp tingle, while inside, it continuously erupted with incandescent destructive lightning and fire. Wherever it passed, even the void emitted groans of unbearable strain.

This minor realm of the Divine Martial World seemed unable to withstand such violently surging vital and baleful energy.

Xu Yunfan's Martial Dao Celestial Eye clearly saw that within this torrent descending from the Purple Micro Imperial Star, every wisp of starlight carried terrifying tribulation baleful energy capable of extinguishing a true spirit. It was less of a guidance and more of a doomsday judgment descending from the heavens.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes, his expression solemn. With his Martial Dao Celestial Eye open, he naturally saw clearly what kind of destructive nature this pillar of light from the Nine Heavens contained.

Immediately following the Purple Micro star power came terrifying fluctuations capable of destroying all things.

It was like the final test sent down by the Imperial Star.

Countless fine, thunder-like, purely incandescent streams of light poured down like a wild waterfall.

That was the "Star Extinguishing Thunderfire Tribulation Baleful Energy" inherent within the Stellar Vital Energy current itself, capable of shattering the void and extinguishing true spirits!

Its target was precisely Xu Yunfan, who had provoked it, and the core guiding ritual.

The sky of the Divine Martial World twisted, quaked, and groaned frantically at this moment.

The golden mountains and rivers cracked under the terrifying pressure.

Xu Yunfan's face instantly turned pale, and the shadow of his True Martial Dharma Form flickered violently, but the light in his eyes, interweaving coldness and indifference, burned to its peak.

The vital energy had arrived!

However, it came wrapped in destruction.

The current Celestial Vital Energy of the Northern Dipper Purple Micro was no longer gentle spiritual energy of heaven and earth, but a domineering torrent containing destruction and imperial might.

Xu Yunfan stared fixedly at the incandescent star lightning tribulation baleful energy torrent descending from the heavens, as if it intended to shatter the entire Suspended Sky Prefecture and even his incarnation, and at the deeper point within the torrent that was becoming increasingly solid, radiating a supreme violet intent that made even the soul tremble with longing.

Feeling the frantic warnings in his heart, Xu Yunfan's mouth curled into a nearly ferocious arc.

It succeeded!

The ritual had successfully connected.

The bait of the trap had arrived!

Next, the true battle to seize life from "Heaven" would begin.

His main body's hand seals changed again, his eyes leaving only the descending Imperial Star torrent capable of crushing everything, including the invisible cage and shackles. He did not hesitate to urge his incarnation to actively meet the destructive star flame.

What he intended to do was to intercept that supreme Purple Micro origin within this torrent of destruction.

Xu Yunfan's heart was as calm as an ancient well, his eyes growing increasingly cold.

Facing the incandescent star lightning tribulation baleful energy torrent capable of crushing the Suspended Sky Prefecture and extinguishing true spirits, he did not retreat in the slightest. Instead, he fully activated the core guiding ritual, truly like a moth rushing into the flame, charging resolutely into the core of that destructive torrent!

*BOOM!!!*

The instant he contacted the destructive star flame, unimaginable pain and shock instantly tore Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense apart.

The Purple Micro Celestial Vital Energy torrent carrying the "Star Extinguishing Thunderfire Tribulation Baleful Energy" was like millions of red-hot steel blades and thunder hammers acting upon his body simultaneously.

The True Martial Dharma Form behind him instantly became illusory and transparent, emitting a groan on the verge of shattering, the pure energy it contained being rapidly annihilated and worn away by this domineering Imperial Star power.

The spiritual power maintaining it was like a candle in the wind, frantically flickering and being wildly poured out.

But Xu Yunfan was already prepared!

His main body was in a safe location, his Martial Dao Celestial Eye fully open, locking onto the core of the torrent where that increasingly solid point of deep violet light, radiating supreme dignity and the origin of destruction, resided.

That was the purest origin of the Northern Dipper Purple Micro Celestial Vital Energy after being washed through the tribulation baleful energy!

"Give me... come here!"

A low roar emitted from Xu Yunfan's throat. He stepped on the Dipper Constellation, his hands forming seals like phantoms, his mouth chanting incantations, and then his fingers pointed with mystery.

The True Martial Dharma Form shadow suspended at the core of the ritual suddenly erupted with light. The blurred image of the turtle and snake entwining manifested a clarity of outline unprecedented under the terrifying pressure, and an ancient and heavy suppressing force spread out.

This True Martial Shadow became the anchor point for the destructive torrent at this moment, cooperating with the secret power of the ritual, to tear open a tiny gap within the wildly pouring star lightning tribulation!

The moment the gap appeared, Xu Yunfan's will, like the most precise catcher, established a brief yet stable connection with that point of supreme violet intent.

He no longer attempted to block or resist the destructive nature of the torrent, but instead fully operated the cultivation method of the *True Martial Subduing Demon True Scripture*!

"The Origin returns to the Void, the Divine Intent guards the One. Absorb the Stellar Tribulation Baleful Energy, refine the Imperial Qi Origin! Draw!"

With the activation of the hand seal, that point of Northern Dipper Purple Micro Celestial Vital Energy, captured by his will, pure to the extreme and containing an unparalleled imperial might, was instantly drawn and enveloped by the unique spiritual power of the *True Martial Subduing Demon True Scripture*.

As the spiritual power circulated, the True Martial Millstone constructed within his spine forcibly incorporated the destructive tribulation baleful energy and violent imperial might into the path of refinement.

Pain!

A pain that went deep into the marrow and tore the soul apart!

Even with the buffering of the True Martial Dharma Form, the pain of directly refining such a supreme Celestial Vital Energy origin still far exceeded Xu Yunfan's imagination.

That deep violet origin contained an indescribable "weight" and "baleful energy," as if a miniature Imperial Star had directly crashed into his meridians. Wherever it passed, the meridians shattered inch by inch, only to be frantically repaired by the extreme regenerative power brought by the subsequent True Martial Dharma Body.

Every tear and repair brought a torment akin to hell.

Furthermore, a vast and dignified spiritual sense impact, like an emperor's reprimand, directly struck his Purple Mansion Consciousness Sea, attempting to crush his will to resist!

This kind of Celestial Vital and Terrestrial Baleful Energy was indeed exceptionally mystical.

That True Lord Qingyuan must have put in a great deal of effort to capture it from the starry sky outside the realm.

Blood overflowed from Xu Yunfan's mouth, his face as pale as paper, with fine threads of blood seeping from his seven orifices.

But the light in his eyes grew increasingly intense!

The *True Martial Subduing Demon True Scripture* has always emphasized the stability of foundations and the tempering of will, focusing on using the unmoving Xuanwu to suppress oneself, and using the fearless True Martial to subdue demons and all evils.

This current refining process was exactly as described in the *True Martial Subduing Demon True Scripture*: "Xuanwu covers the body, tribulation baleful energy forges the form; True Martial breaks calamity, Imperial Qi returns to the heart."

As that point of deep violet origin was continuously ground and purified by the True Martial Millstone constructed within his body, its violence and destructiveness were forcibly stripped away and integrated into Xu Yunfan's own foundation, which served as the refining cauldron. This made his Dao Body's meridians become even more resilient through repeated shattering and reorganization, faintly taking on a texture like starlight glaze.
