Chapter 187: One Day the Dragon Cries

The snow drifted coldly.

Fish in the lake knew nothing of the freezing cold, frogs croaked upon the lotus leaves, and swans spread their wings in the deep waters.

As the banquet had only just begun, the various prodigies maintained their etiquette and grace. They flattered one another as they conversed, creating a harmonious atmosphere.

Pang Lianyun, sitting opposite, though he looked unfavorably upon Li Xian, did not seek trouble, instead chatting casually about interesting matters with the prodigies around him.

After a quarter of an hour.

Seventy-five graceful women rowed their boats over, serving the second course. Leading them was a woman of exceptional beauty, dressed in a colorful skirt with flowing silk ribbons. She was specifically there to serve the dish to the prodigies.

She walked gracefully at the front, ascending directly to the seventh floor. The remaining women followed closely behind, well-trained. Soon, the second dish was delivered to Li Xian’s table.

This dish was far more exquisite than the previous one. It was arranged in the shape of a dragon, brandishing its claws and teeth, lifelike with golden scales.

It looked as if, were it thrown into the lake, it would simply fly away.

"Miss, what is the name of this dish?" Li Xian asked.

The graceful woman smiled sweetly and explained, "This is 'One Day the Dragon Cries.' Young Master, be careful not to get scratched by the dragon."

"Thank you," Li Xian smiled back.

This dish was mysterious; it had no counterpart in the restaurants or canteens of the prefectural city. It was the first time it had appeared, and for a moment, no one knew what to make of it. Li Xian observed it closely, but his knowledge was shallow, and appreciating fine cuisine was not his strong suit.

"A martial artist should have the tolerance of the sea and a vast reserve of knowledge. I am far from achieving this, and I fear I am inferior to the prodigies present. When I return, besides practicing martial arts, I must read more strange and miscellaneous books."

He held his composure, not moving his chopsticks first, and observed the people around him.

Hua Fei cupped his fists and said, "Brother Pang Hao, with your experience, how should one eat this dish?"

Pang Hao’s face flushed slightly. He had just been showing off his knowledge, stealing the spotlight. He did not expect the second dish to be beyond his expectations, leaving him unable to answer for a long time.

Hua Fei laughed and said, "Is it also about rebirth through fire?" No one answered. This "One Day the Dragon Cries" was as exquisite as a sculpture, and the woman had warned them to be careful, so for a moment, no one knew where to start.

"Hahaha," Hua Fei laughed. "Then I shall be the first to try."

He picked up his chopsticks and said, "What a fine dish, the fragrance is overflowing. I shall taste the dragon’s head first." With a precise application of strength, he snapped off the dragon’s head with his chopsticks, leaving the rest of the body intact.

He put it in his mouth, chewing slowly. He felt the fragrance bloom, a deliciousness that was hard to describe, slightly sweet.

But moments later, his expression changed drastically. He grabbed the basin next to his table and spat out a blackish-brown, foul-smelling substance.

"Pooh, pooh, pooh! What is this stuff?! It started sweet but turned sour as I ate. I thought the flavor was complex and changing, so I savored it slowly. Who knew that towards the end, it became increasingly rotten and hard to bear, like rotten meat!"

He was furious and took a few sips of fine wine to rinse his mouth.

He smelled another foul odor and saw that the "One Day the Dragon Cries" on his table had already decayed. The dragon’s body had turned into a blackish-brown, rotten mess.

"So that’s how it is," Pang Lianyun said. "It’s like this, Brother Hua Fei. Your way of eating is wrong, completely wrong."

The crowd was gloating, all curious. Hua Fei’s face was unsightly; he had made a fool of himself twice today and was indignant. "Then tell me, what is the correct way to eat it?"

Pang Lianyun said, "If I am not mistaken, the main ingredient of this dish is the 'Deep Sea Blood Shrimp.' This shrimp grows in the deep sea, its body slender and long, somewhat resembling a dragon. Thus, it is also called 'Blood Dragon Child.'"

"This dish uses the meat of the Deep Sea Blood Shrimp as its material. It is first stored for forty-nine days. When the shrimp meat is on the verge of rotting but not yet rotten, the flesh becomes pure white and translucent, like fine jade, and is at its most tender. However, at this time, the shrimp meat is already decaying and cannot touch any impurities. It rots upon contact with hands, sweat, wood..."

"Your mouthful of saliva naturally counts as an impurity."

Hearing this, the prodigies on the second floor burst into laughter. The sound traveled out, amusing those on the Dragon Gate Tower and by the lake.

Hua Fei could not save face, his expression shifting between anger and shame. Pang Lianyun continued eloquently:

"They add sheep hearts, pig livers, turtle kidneys... to the shrimp meat. These five organs of the five beasts all need to be taken from embryos, possessing the meaning of the five elements. They are摘取 from the fetal body before they have been tainted by the secular world. Then, the scales are garnished. These scales, dragon whiskers, and claws... are all extremely expensive medicinal herbs. They wrap the shrimp meat, insulating it from the outside world. Thus, the dragon’s body remains unspoiled and lifelike."

"In this way, this dish... is called 'One Day the Dragon Cries.' It rots upon touch."

Li Xian nodded secretly. The prodigies of the prefectural city, influenced from a young age, possessed extremely broad knowledge. Hua Fei asked, "It rots upon touch, so how are we supposed to eat it?"

Pang Lianyun frowned and said, "Perhaps... this dish is just for us to admire. The meaning is not in eating, but in seeing?"

The prodigies all nodded, pushing their plates to the edge of the table.

Suddenly, a hearty laugh was heard: "Hahaha, Young Master Pang has quite the knowledge, worthy of being a disciple of the Seven Mountains Sect. What you said is ninety percent correct. However, a dish is served to be eaten. How can we just watch and not move our chopsticks?"

"The young heroes on the seventh, sixth, and fifth floors have already finished their 'One Day the Dragon Cries.' There are talents on the fourth and third floors as well, who have appreciated its deliciousness. I hope you will show your prowess and not辜负 our good intentions."

The prodigies on the second floor changed color upon hearing this, realizing the gap between them and looking at each other in dismay. But this was a dish that could not be touched or put in the mouth; how could one eat it?

Pang Lianyun, full of suspicion, tried to find a way. He tried several times, his hand stopping in mid-air, truly at a loss. He couldn't help but wonder: "Did those prodigies on the upper floors endure the rot and swallow it whole?"

Li Xian pondered: "If one's strength is insufficient, even if a delicious dish is delivered to one's mouth, it is hard to swallow." He stroked his chin, deep in thought.

Li Xian saw that this dish was lifelike, like a real dragon. It not only had the form of a real dragon but also the essence. Shrimp meat, sheep heart, pig liver, turtle kidney. These five organs of the five beasts were all taken from embryos. Like newborn infants, not yet born, pure all over.

Suddenly, an idea came to him: If there were a pure substance to wrap the shrimp meat, and then swallow it directly, one could enjoy this delicacy.

He scrutinized the dish and found a transparent thread along the dragon’s spine. Li Xian thought to himself: "It’s silkworm silk, so that’s it." He was close to the Madam and knew silkworm silk best. This silkworm silk was of extremely high quality, most likely from the One Union Manor.

"A book has a thousand different interpretations, and a dish naturally has a thousand different ways to eat it. This method is entirely my wild guess, but if I fail, there is no loss. What is there to be hesitant about?"

Li Xian was carefree in his heart. He immediately asked for a silver basin and fetched some clean water. He threw the dish into the water and placed it by the stove to boil.

Clean water is a pure substance, but a silver basin is an impure object. During the boiling, Li Xian slapped the side of the basin, applying the essence of the "Breeze Leg." This caused the water to swirl inward, keeping the shrimp meat suspended in the center.

Gradually, the soup was cooked, emitting a fragrance. The soup turned golden with hints of green; this meant the shrimp meat had changed its texture. It could now be eaten since it wouldn't rot upon touching the impurities.

This measure was clearly the most ordinary, but in this situation, it was breathtaking. The spectators on the Dragon Gate Tower all stood up to watch.

"You are crazy!" Pang Lianyun cursed.

"Why am I crazy?" Li Xian did not understand.

"You... you... how could you do this?!" Pang Lianyun roared.

The prodigies in the tower were all thinking of ways to use martial arts to overcome the problem of the shrimp meat rotting easily. They had also heard that the prodigies on the upper floors had already eaten it, so they were even more obsessed with finding a solution.

Li Xian's move seemed ordinary, but it was exceptionally unique. It made the crowd, who had been pondering deeply, feel humiliated.

Pang Lianyun thought for a moment and said, "This dish cost so much effort to make. How can you treat it so wastefully!"

At this time, the clear soup was ready, golden in color. Although it was no longer in the shape of a dragon, it was even more sweet and tempting.

Li Xian laughed and said, "How is it wasteful? Since this dish was sent to my table, I can naturally eat it however I want."

"Hmph," Pang Lianyun said, "If it were an ordinary dish, I wouldn't care if you threw it away or ate it all. But this dish has a different meaning. It has the form of a dragon, the five elements and five organs inside, and dragon scales and whiskers outside. Such a dish requires a specific method of eating to be worthy of the effort put into it. A precious sword matches a gentleman, and a precious dish should also match the corresponding standard and method of eating. Your muddling has greatly altered the dish's appearance; how is that not wasteful?"

The soup was ready, and Li Xian ladled a bowl, taking a small sip to taste. The fragrance filled his mouth and lingered. Li Xian knew that this way of eating was also correct. Pang Lianyun's thinking was rigid, and he held a grudge against Li Xian, so he was trying to find fault.

"You are too arrogant!" Pang Lianyun was indignant. Seeing Li Xian drinking the soup on his own, he actually ignored him.

"Brother Pang, why the hurry?" Li Xian finished the bowl of clear soup and said, "Look, this pot of clear soup is very fragrant, isn't it? You said this dish has the form of a dragon, the five elements and five organs inside, and dragon whiskers and scales outside. That is very good. But you also know that a dragon-like thing is ultimately not a dragon. It has the form of a dragon but is a dish on the table. It is not an exaggeration to call it a 'fake dragon.'"

"Whereas I used it to make soup, although the dragon form is lost, the shrimp meat and organs return to their original essence, releasing the true flavor. Restoring the soup's flavor is truly the best. As martial artists, we consume the essence of heaven and earth. Is what we seek not to seek the origin and the truth?"

"Why, when it comes to this, is Brother Pang so难以接受?"

Li Xian's knowledge was shallow, but he was eloquent and glib. When it came to seeking the origin and the truth, the listeners were first stunned, then felt it made sense. This恶尉 Li Xian's speech was extremely extraordinary.

Gu Nianjun stared at him, greatly surprised.

"You... you... this..." Pang Lianyun was speechless.

Li Xian said, "I don't exclude the possibility that there are other ways to eat it. But for those who can't start with my method,不妨 give it a try. Everyone seeks the carp turning into a dragon, but sometimes, being a leisurely shrimp is quite enjoyable."

"At least the soup is sweet."

The prodigies on the second floor were all tempted upon hearing this and said one after another, "Brother Li's words make sense. You have truly broadened our horizons."

"Yes, today we boil a pot of leisurely shrimp soup and admire the scenery of the lake. It is the most pleasant thing."

"Brother Li has a novel perspective, impressive, impressive."

Everyone began to boil soup and drink it, enjoying the freshness in the soup. The deep sea blood shrimp meat, after being boiled, was no longer rotten. It was chewy in the mouth, with a unique flavor.

It didn't take long for the "One Day the Dragon Cries" on the second floor to be swept clean. Only Pang Lianyun was in a dilemma, unable to think of a better way to eat it, and unwilling to admit defeat.

Li Xian laughed and said, "Brother Pang, are you saving this dish for last?"

"Hmph!" Pang Lianyun said, "How dare you show off such heretical ways in front of me? Today, I will show you what a true way of eating is."

He was like a man riding a tiger; he couldn't get off. "I cannot be outdone by this小子. How strong this小子 is is still unknown, but he has a glib tongue, and I cannot argue with him."

He pretended to be calm, but in reality, he was putting all his eggs in one basket. He said, "The secret of taking this dish lies entirely in the five organs. The five organs hold the secrets of the five elements. One simply needs to swallow the entire dish in one mouthful. The cycle of the five elements will naturally keep the shrimp meat from rotting, allowing one to enjoy the original flavor of the dish. Watch closely."

Pang Lianyun slapped the table with one hand. He sent the dish flying into the air and swallowed it whole, chewing loudly, revealing a delicious expression.

But moments later, his brow furrowed again and again. The shrimp meat turned sour and rotten. He forced himself to act as if it were delicious, pretending to enjoy it. But the foul smell of the rotten shrimp was truly hard to swallow, and he almost vomited several times. Hua Fei only ate the head and already vomited violently. He swallowed the whole body, one can imagine the torment.

Li Xian laughed and said, "Brother Pang, I admire you, truly I admire you. It seems your way of eating is the correct one. I concede defeat."

Those with discerning eyes could see that Pang Lianyun had already failed. If he held on any longer, it would only result in vomiting. But Li Xian's flattery at this moment happened to block his way out. He couldn't vomit, and he couldn't swallow.

The shrimp meat decayed, turning into a foul-smelling broth. Pang Lianyun's face turned blue and purple, but he dared not speak, as opening his mouth would expose him.

Li Xian, feeling playful, said, "Brother Pang, if it's really delicious, please give a thumbs up."

Pang Lianyun, afraid of being discovered, immediately raised his thumb and nodded repeatedly. Li Xian sighed, "What a pity, what a pity... such a good thing, why didn't you say so earlier? I want to eat it but can't anymore."

Pang Lianyun wanted to cry but had no tears, while the prodigies on the second floor struggled to hold back their laughter.

In a distant pavilion. Lin Aoshan was holding her stomach, laughing uncontrollably, and even Gu Nianjun couldn't help but smile.

Gu Nianjun thought of something, her smile gradually fading. She murmured to herself, "Madam of the Broken Sword... what exactly are you here for?"
