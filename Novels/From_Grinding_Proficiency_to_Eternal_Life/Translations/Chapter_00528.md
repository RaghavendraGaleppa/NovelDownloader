# Chapter 528: Within the Peak

“How is the situation on the peak?”

Xu Yunfan’s voice was calm and even.

With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he naturally knew the details of True Martial Peak. However, there were times when asking the disciples within the peak could reveal their state of mind.

The Primordial Origin Sect mostly operated with the style of a demonic sect. Now, the number of disciples seemed rather sparse.

Had they defected?

Wu Yan immediately replied, “Reporting to the Peak Master, everything on the peak is as usual. The disciples are still diligently cultivating and training hard; the prestige of True Martial Peak has not fallen. It’s just…”

He hesitated, his voice lowering a few decibels. “Since the Peak Master’s communication was cut off, the monthly allocation of resources on the peak has decreased more and more. Pills and spirit stones are now less than seventy percent of what they used to be.

All the disciples are worried in their hearts. Some disciples… have left the peak.”

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow slightly and said indifferently, “Did those departing disciples go through the formal withdrawal procedures?”

Wu Yan felt a chill in his heart and answered, “Peak Master, they did not.”

“That means they have defected,” Xu Yunfan murmured.

Hearing this, Wu Yan immediately said, “I shall strictly follow the Peak Master’s orders. I will immediately send disciples to hunt them down and kill them, pull out their tendons and peel their skin, refine their souls—showing no mercy!”

Listening to the reports from Wu Yan and Chen Tiezhu, Xu Yunfan’s face remained calm, but he understood the current dilemma of True Martial Peak.

The *True Martial Subdues Demons Sutra*, which he had once pinned his hopes on to establish the peak and gain a foothold in the Primordial Origin Sect, now seemed like a heavy shackle, locking away the future path of cultivation for all the disciples on the peak.

After all, it had been forcibly occupied by the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land. If one cultivated it deeply, it wouldn't be surprising if, upon leaving the Primordial Origin Sect, a bald monk came over and said you had an affinity with the Buddha.

If you didn't comply, fighting all the way to the end might even result in that shameless Dao Lord enlightening a monk to fish for trouble.

Changing to another cultivation method would be for the best.

“You have worked hard,” Xu Yunfan said, his voice steady, carrying a trace of comforting power.

“Diligent cultivation and training are the foundation. It is excellent that the disciples on the peak have not slacked off. As for the path ahead…”

He paused, his gaze sweeping over the three men with their varied expressions. “I am already aware of the hidden dangers of the *True Martial Subdues Demons Sutra*. This is not your fault, nor is it a deficiency of the sutra itself. It is merely the result of the game between the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land and the Sect, and we are the innocent victims caught in the crossfire.”

As far as the Primordial Origin Sect was concerned, whether it was a loss or not, it at least thoroughly disgusted the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land. After all, the root of the *True Martial Subdues Demons Sutra* lay in the Divine Martial World, and the Divine Martial World was firmly in the grip of the Primordial Origin Sect.

That was why the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land settled for second best, using the opportunity to guide the four disciples of the Three Sages to perform the Rite of the King Buddha.

He did not explain in detail the calculations involving True Lords and Bodhisattvas; it was too distant and unhelpful for the disciples before him.

“Pass down the order,” Xu Yunfan instructed. “All peak affairs shall temporarily be presided over by Bi Yuan. As for resource usage, if your contribution points are sufficient, they will be allocated. It will be more, not less, compared to before.

“Tell all the disciples to remain calm; the Peak Master has his own arrangements. Wu Yan, Tiezhu, you two go handle the peak’s internal affairs first.”

It was a joke. In the Primordial Origin Sect, everything was measured by contribution points. He would still give them some spirit stones monthly for their expenses. In other peaks, clothing, food, housing, and transportation all required money.

If he didn't squeeze them dry, it would be an insult to the name of the Primordial Origin Demon Sect.

This Daoist Master Xu is kind-hearted.

Compared to the other Foundation Establishment True Persons in the Primordial Origin Sect, he was as pure and kind as a white lotus.

“Yes, Peak Master!”

Wu Yan and Chen Tiezhu’s spirits lifted. The return of the Peak Master brought a backbone, and the guarantee of resources eased half the heavy burden on their minds. They accepted the order and retreated respectfully.

The tall, slender cultivator with a阴柔 (yin-soft) aura also prepared to leave with them, but Xu Yunfan said indifferently, “Yang Ying, stay.”

The cultivator named Yang Ying’s body stiffened slightly. A hint of nervousness, hard to detect, flashed through the depths of his lowered eyes, before he immediately stood respectfully with his hands at his sides.

“I am here, Peak Master.”

Xu Yunfan did not speak immediately. The cave dwelling was silent, save for the *tap tap* of his fingers lightly striking the armrest of the chair.

The invisible pressure made fine beads of cold sweat seep from Yang Ying’s forehead.

After a moment, having judged that he had let it simmer long enough, Xu Yunfan slowly spoke: “You are skilled in stealth tracking and have a sharp mind. During this time, the disciples on the peak have been restless. You should be the clearest on this.

“Tell me, what are their thoughts? Is there anyone… whose heart leans toward another peak?”

Yang Ying’s heart tightened. He knew the Peak Master was testing his ability and also warning him.

Not daring to delay, he forced himself to be calm and said, “Reporting to the Peak Master, I have indeed observed something. Most of the disciples on the peak are panicked and confused because the Sutra was cut off. The majority, like Senior Brother Wu and Junior Brother Chen, are diligent in their cultivation and loyal to the Peak Master.

“But there are also some disciples, especially those who joined later and have unstable minds, who privately have many complaints. Some have even thought of finding an opportunity to switch allegiance and choose a different master.

“However, with Senior Brother Bi presiding over the peak and the Peak Master’s prestige still holding, most of them wouldn't dare. As for the other peaks…”

His voice lowered further, carrying a hint of certainty.

“Recently, the Hundred Desires Peak has indeed sent some disciples to linger around the periphery of True Martial Peak, attempting to lure disciples with unstable Dao hearts. They say they can go to the Hundred Desires Peak to enjoy the supreme pleasure of men and women, practice the supreme Yin-Yang Dharma, and break free from the shackles of this Sutra…

“There are a few who have had private contact. But I have been paying close attention, and no disaster has yet occurred.”

A cold light flashed and vanished in Xu Yunfan’s eyes.

Scum of the Hundred Desires Peak!

Their methods were indeed fast and dirty. Cultivating the *True Martial Subdues Demons Sutra* results in vigorous Yang energy, making one a supreme cauldron. They actually came right to his doorstep to dig out his foundation.

In this world, from the Dao Lords and Bodhisattvas above to the Golden Core and Foundation Establishment cultivators below, there wasn't a single trustworthy or good person.

While he was away, they resorted to such despicable tactics.

“Well done. Keep watching. If there are any more such inducements, inform Bi Yuan immediately and find a way to capture them. As for those disciples with wavering minds…”

Xu Yunfan pondered for a moment. “We’ll deal with them when the time comes.”

“I obey the command!” Yang Ying’s heart relaxed, understanding that he had passed this test and might even gain more trust from the Peak Master because of it.

He knew well that the seemingly young Peak Master before him was ruthless in手段 and meticulous in thought—far from being an ordinary Foundation Establishment True Person.

“Go,” Xu Yunfan waved his hand. Yang Ying looked as if he had been granted a reprieve, his figure silently merging into the shadows of the corner of the cave dwelling, as if he had never been there.

The cave dwelling returned to silence.

Xu Yunfan closed his eyes, his consciousness sinking into the storage bracelet gifted by Chu Chengnan.

Within the vast space, piles of spirit stones flickered with various spiritual lights, the fragrance of precious herbs permeated the air, rare ores and jade materials overflowed with treasure light, and there were many ancient artifacts of unknown function but with obscure and powerful auras…

Just a rough scan revealed that its value was enough to support his expenses for the next several hundred years, and even more.

A moment later, the restrictions on the cave dwelling were triggered again, and several figures entered in succession.

The leader was Bi Yuan. He wore a simple Daoist robe, and his aura was harmonious. His cultivation base had clearly improved significantly compared to when he was in the Divine Martial World. Although he was still stuck at the peak of Qi Condensation due to his foundation, his steady and experienced demeanor was even better than before.
