# Chapter 50: Sudden Heavy Rain, Venturing Deep Into the Storm

Night had already fallen.

Having killed one deer and two tigers in succession, Li Xian’s energy was greatly depleted.

He found a quiet spot, lit a bonfire, and lay down on the snow to rest. He scattered Beast Repelling Incense around the area to keep snakes, rats, and ants at bay.

"Hunting in winter is actually much more comfortable than in spring or summer," Li Xian muttered to himself.

Although winter is cold, it is also dry. The forests in summer are full of snakes, insects, rodents, and leeches—those are the truly terrifying things.

Over the fire, a string of deer, tiger, and patterned leopard meat was roasting, sizzling with oil.

Winter hunting had its rules: aside from the valuable parts, the rest of the prey could be eaten freely. The valuable parts referred to bear paws, bear gallbladders, tiger gallbladders, tiger hearts...

Hunting a wild beast brought immense benefits. The value of the meat was secondary; for example, a tiger's skin could be made into clothes or carpets, which was quite expensive. Tiger bones and blood could be used in medicine or to refine pills, while tiger claws and teeth could be used to make weapons... Tiger gallbladders, hearts, and whips had even more uses, such as for soaking in wine or eating raw...

However, all that money went to the higher-ups and had nothing to do with the hunters.

The deer meat was the tenderest and cooked the fastest. A bite released a mix of oil and faint traces of blood. Although no seasonings were added, the aroma was rich. This wild deer was young, and its meat was at its most tender and smooth. Because Li Xian used fruit branches to skewer the meat, it carried a faint fruity aftertaste that was endless.

\[You cooked and ate deer meat, Proficiency +4\]
\[You cooked and ate deer meat, Proficiency +3\]
\[You cooked and ate deer meat, Proficiency +2\]

The proficiency of the skill \[Ingestion\] was slowly rising.

Li Xian discovered that eating the same type of meat consecutively caused the proficiency gain to gradually decrease, eventually dropping to \[1\]. However, this change wasn't permanent. If he waited for a period—several hours or a few days—before eating deer meat again, the proficiency gain would return to \[4\], only to decrease to \[1\] again with continuous eating.

But if he changed the method, such as making "soup" or "jerky," the results would be different.

"Changing the way I eat meat is the key to increasing my 'Ingestion' proficiency faster."

"I know the Four Directions Fist and Breeze Legs, but among all my skills, the most useful is probably \[Ingestion\]."

Li Xian knew that the most direct way for a martial artist to replenish energy was to "eat."

By now, the tiger and leopard meat were also cooked.

\[You cooked and ate wild tiger meat, Proficiency +6\]
\[You cooked and ate patterned leopard meat, Proficiency +9\]

After a full meal, the proficiency of \[Ingestion\] had increased by over \[70\] points.

Li Xian was already full, but to improve \[Ingestion\] as quickly as possible, he cut pieces of tiger, leopard, and deer meat, mixed them with wild vegetables and fruits, and boiled them into a soup.

\[You drank the Three Beast Soup, Proficiency +12\]

Drinking a pot of soup added another \[47\] points of proficiency.

"If I eat any more, my stomach will burst."

"If I keep eating tiger, deer, and leopard meat for the next three days, it shouldn't be difficult to bring \[Ingestion\] to proficiency."

"Right, I can smoke the tiger, deer, and leopard meat into jerky tonight!"

"Even if the winter hunt ends, I won't have to worry about running out of meat!"

Li Xian was overjoyed at the thought.

He immediately took out his knife, sliced the meat into thin pieces, and placed them over the fire to smoke. He would make as much jerky as possible!

After finishing these tasks, Li Xian lay back on the snow, his stomach round and full.

Gazing at the bright stars and moon, enjoying the moonlight, he felt a momentary daze, as if he had returned to the past.

Hunting in the mountains... actually brought him a sense of peace.

A faint feeling of freedom lingered at the tip of his nose.

"Freedom... must be fought for, not begged for from others."

Li Xian rested his head on his hands, thinking firmly.

***

The next day.

Li Xian marked his trail along the way, intending to venture a little deeper.

His luck was excellent; in just one morning, he hunted a tiger and a bear. The tiger was an ordinary mountain tiger, and the bear was a black-furred bear.

Hunting the tiger was uneventful; Li Xian spotted its tracks from a distance and shot it directly. It wasn't as troublesome as the patterned leopard.

But when hunting the bear, an accident occurred. The black-furred bear was licking honey—a type of honey from "Black Needle Bees." These venomous bees were not afraid of the cold and carried potent poison.

After Li Xian shot the black-furred bear, he was chased by the Black Needle Bees. In the end, he hid in an icy river to barely escape the ordeal. Fortunately, his internal energy was refined, and he could withstand the cold; otherwise, he would have frozen to death in the river.

However, his clothes were completely soaked. He had to start a fire to dry them before making any other plans.

Everything had been going well. If he kept up this pace, he could easily gather three bears, three tigers, and three deer.

But at noon that day, a gust of wind blew, and Li Xian immediately sensed something was wrong. He smelled the moisture in the air and quickly sought a cave to take shelter.

Just as expected, it wasn't long before a heavy downpour began.

"The face of the heavens changes in an instant, showing no mercy."

Li Xian sighed heavily.

This was terrible. The rain would wash away his tracks, obscure his vision, and make the cold air even more intense. The floating mist was bone-chilling.

Li Xian's rhythm was broken. In this situation, he could only hide in the cave and wait for the rain to stop. When hungry, he ate jerky.

The heavy rain didn't stop; as night fell, the storm only grew stronger. Li Xian frowned, looking at the rain. Was it going to rain for another day?

His harvest on this trip was already quite substantial: one deer, three tigers, and one bear, all of exceptional quality—a patterned tiger, a patterned leopard, and a black-furred bear. These three beasts were all stronger than ordinary tigers and bears.

"With this harvest, I can enter the Leisure Martial Pavilion to exchange for a Tier B martial art."

"But... this winter hunt is a rare opportunity for me to be promoted to Class B. Should I just let it slip away?"

Li Xian smoked the meat of the bear, tiger, deer, and leopard while considering his next plan.

"Hunting in the rain is extremely risky."

"But opportunities are fleeting. Tomorrow... whether the rain stops or not, I will seize the last day, venture deep into the forest, and try to hunt two more bears!"

Li Xian clenched his fists and made his decision. He would seize every opportunity!

Night fell.

The world was shrouded in darkness, and the heavy rain poured down. At this time, the mountains were at their coldest. The cold and damp air seeped into everything, leaving one feeling helpless.

Li Xian stared blankly at the rain... watching it fall harder and harder, endless and unstoppable.

He sat quietly through the night.

Around the hour of Si (9-11 AM), the sky began to lighten slightly.

Li Xian gave up all hope of the rain stopping. He slung the "Deer Hunting Bow" over his shoulder and set off into the depths of the forest.

Rain mixed with sleet pooled into puddles on the uneven ground. A step into one sent a chill rushing straight to his heart, making him shudder.

He hadn't gone far before his entire body was soaked. His internal energy circulated within him, preventing him from losing body heat and passing out.

The rain washed away his footprints, rendering his tracking skills useless. He could only wander around, hoping for a stroke of luck.

Suddenly...

Through the hazy winter rain, a figure suddenly appeared in his field of vision.
