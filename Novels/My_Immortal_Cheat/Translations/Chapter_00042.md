# Chapter 42: A Motley Crowd

"Every world was incredibly prosperous, pushing its own path to the extreme. To seize resources, internal wars raged for years. To alleviate the pressure of these wars, all worlds coincidentally began exploring worlds beyond their own."

Zhou Yu slowly recounted, unveiling a different ancient Kyushu to Zhou Tian.

"The eight great worlds were incredibly close to each other, making mutual discovery easy. Initially, only two worlds discovered each other, immediately triggering war. After all, no one could ignore the resources of another world. As the fighting escalated, all the worlds were dragged in."

"The eight great worlds warred simultaneously, with countless masters participating. That battle shattered the void, even breaking the world barriers of the eight great worlds. Every world was immensely powerful; once they truly got serious, no one could stop them."

"It was only then that the Ninth Kyushu appeared. They had long since discovered the eight warring great worlds but had remained hidden, attempting to reap the spoils of the conflict. They only emerged when the barriers of the eight great worlds were shattered."

"However, they overestimated themselves and underestimated the other eight great worlds. The moment the eight great worlds saw the people of the Ninth Kyushu, they instantly realized their objective. Perhaps the Ninth Kyushu was indeed stronger than any one, two, or even three of the already shattered worlds, but it was absolutely no match for the combined might of all eight."

"The top cultivators among the eight worlds were all peerless geniuses. Naturally, they understood that if they continued to fight amongst themselves, they would only be swallowed whole. So, they cast aside their hatred and joined forces, directly shattering the Ninth Kyushu. Their world was torn apart, which is why the Ninth Kyushu now lacks a 'Mandate of Heaven'!"

"After eliminating the Ninth Kyushu, the other eight states also calmed down. Continuing the war would only bring harm, not benefit. They could continue exploring the void instead of warring amongst themselves. Since all the world barriers had been broken and could no longer resist the void's erosion, the almighty cultivators of the eight states laid down layers of formations across the nine worlds. They combined the remaining world origins and reassembled them, forming a temporary alliance. After countless years of development, the Kyushu of today came to be..."

Zhou Tian listened, dumbfounded. My goodness... he never imagined this world possessed such a legendary past! Exploring worlds beyond the void was truly remarkable!

Zhou Yu paused, allowing Zhou Tian to fully process this information, then continued, "This is the true history of Kyushu. And the places we're warring in are outside Kyushu, targeting those worlds discovered in the void. There's much more information to learn, which you'll gradually understand as you come into contact with it later..."

Warring against worlds in the void... Holy moly... This was supposed to be a feudal dynasty world, yet it was this powerful?!

Zhou Tian's mind was a bit muddled. What kind of world was this, already exploring the void? It was countless times stronger than his previous life's world!

Finally, Zhou Tian didn't know how he returned. When he came to his senses, he was already in his own bed. He was still incredibly shocked by the information Zhou Yu had given him that day... but after careful thought, only excitement remained. He had initially thought there was just one map, and becoming invincible too quickly would be boring. He never expected there to be a super-large map outside, with many unexplored areas. This was far more interesting...

Imagining himself instantly traversing countless worlds, worlds perishing with a blink of his eyes and new worlds being born with another, Zhou Tian fell into a deep sleep.

The next day, Zhou Tian once again found himself in the pathetic state of being alone. Tian Ling had once again entered secluded cultivation. With less than half a month until the imperial capital finals of the Youth Grand Competition, she wanted to train harder.

The competition held in the imperial capital was indeed the Youth Grand Competition's imperial capital finals. The Youth Grand Competition progressed through a tiered advancement system. After all, Futian State was vast, and the number of young people in each generation was immense; they couldn't all gather in the imperial capital for the competition.

First, local competitions were held. From the various towns of Futian State, a thousand winners were selected and sent to the imperial capital for the final showdown. Of course, Dharma Manifestation realm masters were directly granted entry into the elite competition. After all, most participants were still in the Three Treasures realm, and Dharma Manifestation realm masters participating would be akin to bullying children.

Although the regular season had passed, Tian Ling hadn't participated as she had been staying in Prince Qin's manor. But since Zhou Tian was Prince Qin's heir, it was no problem to get someone into the imperial capital competition. Furthermore, her resume, number of matches, and opponents' information were all complete, making it flawless!

He also wanted to find someone to play with. Zhou Xunchuan and Zhou Zui were also preparing for the upcoming elite competition. Their opponents should not be underestimated. Due to the Youth Grand Competition's mechanism, almost everyone had two opportunities to participate.

Their opponents weren't first-time participants; rather, they were individuals who had already competed in the Youth Grand Competition once before. Since they had cultivated for several years longer, they were somewhat challenging.

This period was truly incredibly boring. No one was there to play with him, no one to chat and joke with. Even Zhou Zui had gone into secluded cultivation, forced by Prince Xiaoyao, to arduously train at home.

His two older brothers were also busy; they left for the imperial palace every morning and didn't return until after dark, making it impossible to even see their faces.

Zhou Tian's daily routine consisted of sleeping until noon, waking up for a meal, then going out for a stroll. He'd look for anyone foolish enough to provoke him, so he could show off a bit or act imposing. After all, he'd been transmigrated for so long, and he hadn't actually met anyone with negative IQs in the imperial capital.

Even those naive little lambs from Daluo Academy, who had been taught a lesson last time, now walked around him, unwilling to say much. Although they had learned from their seniors after returning that Zhou Tian's words were mostly illogical and involved swapping concepts, this was Qin territory. If something truly went wrong, their masters might not arrive in time, so they didn't dare to cause trouble when they saw Zhou Tian... This greatly disappointed Zhou Tian; such "little white rabbits" were rare.

More and more outsiders were arriving in the imperial capital. Forces from the other states had also largely arrived: a group of monks from Luotian Temple, their heads gleaming as if polished; a group of assassins from the Radiant Organization, dressed in white robes, which greatly broadened Zhou Tian's horizons—was this the legendary Unparalleled Creed?

A group of Daoists from the Dao Alliance indeed had an ethereal and otherworldly air about them, at least until Zhou Tian saw their righteous-looking leader entering the local pleasure house.

The Treasure Gathering Pavilion organization was quite interesting. They came not to fight, but to sell things. Each of them was adorned in gold and silver, laden with treasures, and immediately started competing for business with the imperial capital's street vendors.

The Fool organization only sent one young man, or at least he appeared young. After meeting Emperor Qin, he went straight to the Imperial Preceptor's Residence and didn't emerge for a long time; no one knew what kind of secret dealings they were up to.

That very night, the leading胖子 (fat man) from the Treasure Gathering Pavilion approached Zhou Tian. The next day, a book titled "Youth Rankings of Futian State" appeared on the market.
