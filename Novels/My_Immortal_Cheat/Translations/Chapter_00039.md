**Chapter 39: The Adorable Flower Fairies!**

"What's the plan?" asked Yu Gu, the Great General of the Northern Frontier. He wore bone armor crafted from unknown creature bones, glinting with golden light, renowned for guarding the northern borders of the Heavenly Qin Empire.

"What's the plan? Of course, we fight! How can we let such a large piece of prime meat get away?" said Wei Yan, the Great General of the Southern Frontier. Unlike normal people, two blood-red fangs protruded from his mouth. He guarded the Southern Frontier and had an extremely volatile temper.

"Fight? Easier said than done. That's a world comparable to any of the Ancient Nine Provinces, plus the home-field advantage. It won't be that simple," Wu Jian, the Great General of the Northern Frontier, said coldly. His azure long robe exuded no killing intent, making him seem like a scholarly general. He planned thoroughly before acting and was widely respected in the Northern Frontier.

"Not fight? Are we just going to let that piece of prime meat go?" Wei Yan sneered at Wu Jian.

"What level of world fluctuation is that super-large world emitting?" Duke Wei slowly opened his closed eyes and asked.

Zhou Quan scanned the surroundings and then said gravely, "That's precisely what I was about to say. The world fluctuation emanating from that super-large world has reached the level of a Cataclysm!"

"Cataclysm!"

Yu Gu's bone armor glowed, and phantom beast shadows appeared around him, all invincible fierce beast kings, roaring incessantly.

Wei Yan laughed heartily, "This is a Cataclysm! A perfect opportunity to strike!" His two blood-red fangs seemed to drip with intensity.

"Then we must act this time!" Wu Jian sighed. This was a once-in-ten-thousand-year opportunity; not striking now would mean no next chance.

"Your Majesty, what do you say?" The Imperial Advisor retracted all his imposing aura and turned to ask the Qin Emperor. Their discussion was merely preliminary; the final decision rested with the Qin Emperor.

The Qin Emperor's jade finger tapped on the purple-gold dragon throne. After a moment, he looked up and asked, "What do the Ancestors mean?"

"The Grand Ancestor said that you are the Head of the Zhou family, and they will listen to you!"

"Good. In that case, let's make our move. Negotiate with the other major forces. This time, we definitely won't be the only ones acting. Before we take down that force, there must be no internal strife!" A golden light flashed in the Qin Emperor's eyes. He was never indecisive. This was indeed a heaven-sent opportunity; a Cataclysm was a disaster that could shake the very foundation of a world!

"The spatial fluctuations in the Western Frontier are a bit unusual. Our family's defenses cannot be left empty." Just then, Gu Feng, the Great General of the Western Frontier, who had been silent, suddenly spoke.

All eyes turned to him.

"Is it those things?" Wu Jian frowned and asked.

"Not yet certain, but there are indeed fluctuations. It's best to investigate." Gu Feng wasn't entirely sure either.

"After the Youth Tournament, go take a look to prevent any incidents," the Qin Emperor decided on the plan.

"Yes!" the crowd responded.

***

In a sacred place, radiant jade light cascaded from the sky. The ground was like a pristine mirror, reflecting everything, yet the light rain falling upon it stirred ripples.

*Thump! Thump! Thump!*

Dull thudding sounds echoed through the area. Continuous ripples spread out. Following the direction from which the ripples came, two black-robed figures were seen kowtowing rapidly to the ground. They used no means to protect their foreheads. However, each time their heads were about to touch the mirror-like surface, a gentle force would lift them, as if fearing they might get hurt.

Standing before these two black-robed figures was a white-haired youth in white robes—it was Saint-Devil. Judging by the situation, the Saint personality seemed to be in control now.

The Saint looked at the two on the ground, a look of distress on his face. He said, "You don't have to do this. This time, it's not your fault. Who would have thought that Zhou Tian would be so strange, able to resurrect even after his soul vanished for a day?"

The two figures heard these words, but showed no signs of relief. Their actions remained unceasing, and they trembled as they said, "Saint, spare us! No one else will ever know about this matter!"

"What are you saying? I'm not that Devil fellow, why would I take lives at the drop of a hat?" the Saint sighed.

Hearing this, the two on the ground shivered, fear flashing in their eyes. Then, gritting their teeth, they cried out, "Ah!"

With two sharp cries, dark green runes materialized. A ghostly head appeared between them, black mist swirling, and wailing souls shrieking as it lunged towards the Saint! They did not seek to escape, only to die!

"Alas..." Seeing this, the Saint let out a sigh of profound pity. His jade hand waved, and white light enveloped the two of them.

The ghostly head dissipated, and two beautiful, pink flower elves appeared in their place. They were thumb-sized, with tiny wings on their backs, bouncing and fluttering onto the Saint's body. They affectionately rubbed against his palm, making indiscernible sounds. Through the flower elves' adorable big eyes, a figure bound by black chains could be seen in the depths. They watched their bodies transform into this eerie appearance, unable to speak, unable to escape, suffering eternal torment forever!

Just as he finished dealing with these two, the Saint's serene face showed a hint of surprise. He pulled out a golden scroll from thin air, which was now faintly glowing.

The scroll opened on its own without wind, floating into the air and expanding to an enormous size. Complex runes flickered across it, and a figure entirely shrouded in light appeared, exuding an incredibly grand and ancient aura. Its face was indiscernible, and a voice like a great bell echoed forth, "Saint-Devil, how did things go?"

The Saint looked at the two adorable flower elves in his hand, then looked up and said, "What kind of formation did you give me? It was completely useless! I've already dealt with your two subordinates; they were nothing but wastes!" His expression remained unchanged, his tone righteous.

The figure in the scroll made no overt movements, showing neither joy nor anger. After a moment, it said, "I understand. That formation was incomplete to begin with. I wasn't entirely sure if it would be useful against a Zhou family member. Since it was useless, then forget about it!"

"Now, there's one more thing for you to do. The Heavenly Mandate of the Ninth Province is about to appear. Go and retrieve it for me!" the figure in the scroll commanded. As it mentioned the Heavenly Mandate of the Ninth Province, the light around the majestic figure intensified slightly.

"The Heavenly Mandate of the Ninth Province?" The Saint paused for a moment, but then instantly reacted. "I understand. I'll get it, but the Zhou family seems to be sending people to hunt me down. I'm so scared!"

"They recently discovered a new world and are temporarily unable to spare any hands, so you can rest assured!" the figure said, seemingly having a complete grasp of the Zhou family's movements.

"That's good then. What about my compensation...? Your formation being useless has nothing to do with me. I've worked diligently for you, so you must give me my reward!" The Saint extended his palm towards the figure in the scroll.

The figure in the scroll was silent for a moment. Then, the scroll burst forth with golden light, runes surged out, and the sounds of gods and devils chanting resounded. A light portal opened, and a withered bone, glowing with faint golden light, floated out!
