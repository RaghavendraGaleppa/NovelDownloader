# Chapter 138: The Patrol Sky Division Arrives, Officially Appointed as Eighth Rank!

Li Xian sat cross-legged, a realization dawning in his heart. Shoulders draped in multicolored light, the phenomenon was astonishing.

Martial artists consume the essence of heaven and the nourishment of earth; the physical body is not merely about becoming stronger. If that were all, it would be more direct to practice tempering martial arts to strengthen bones and muscles. Rather, it is about the body containing the trends of heaven and earth, resonating with them. This gives rise to various mystical phenomena, breaking through heavy shackles and extending one's lifespan, achieving a true transformation of body and soul.

Li Xian had entered the "Shoulders Draped in Multicolored Light" realm. His physique, strength, and spirit had significantly increased, but that was not the main point.

"Shoulders Draped in Multicolored Light" was a characteristic of "dissipating without digesting."

He retained the精华 of heaven and earth within his body, but could not digest it. The essence slowly dissipated, embedding itself deep within his blood and muscles.

When a martial artist operates their blood and qi, expands their limbs, and挥洒 martial arts to fight, the blood rushes rapidly. The essence of heaven and earth deep within the body rises with the blood qi.

This distorts natural light, naturally creating the "multicolored light" phenomenon.

Li Xian sensed his own changes carefully, gaining initial insight into the path of cultivation.

His heart surged with emotion, and he struck while the iron was hot. He immediately grabbed the hilt of his blade, following the momentum to strike, sweeping an empty space and raising a wave of Qi.

This was the "Sweep Across the Wasteland" move of the Daluo Blade Art. It should have been called "Sweep Across the Eight Wastes," but likely to avoid a certain other blade art, it was named "Sweep Across the Wasteland."

Li Xian stepped forward, turned his body, and struck again. The perfect blade art had returned to simplicity, flawless and without缺憾. But compared to "reaching the pinnacle," it still lacked a certain meaning.

Multicolored light wrapped around his body. Blade light wove like fabric, mixing light and shadow, dazzling the eyes, and the momentum was terrifying.

[Daluo Blade Art, Proficiency +2]
[Daluo Blade Art, Proficiency +2]

Only after a martial artist enters the "Consuming Essence" realm do they truly touch the true face of the martial path. The martial arts in the world are varied and strange, but only "Consuming Essence" martial artists can cultivate their effects. The higher the quality of the martial art, the more obvious this becomes.

[Green Luo Palm, Proficiency +3]

Li Xian sheathed his blade and brought his palms together. The operation of Qi was natural, and the transition between blade and palm was seamless without a trace, which was already quite rare. When martial artists exchange moves, they fear changing stances the most. Enemies fear opponents changing stances, being caught off guard. They themselves also fear changing stances, which reveals openings.

Two moves seamlessly connected, the martial art executed naturally. Relying on the variability of the moves, one already gains an advantage over others.

Li Xian's shoulders were draped in multicolored light, and his palms contained deep meaning. As he executed the technique now, it faintly resonated with heaven and earth. Not only was the momentum surging and the phenomenon astonishing, but mist also lingered around him.

After the palm technique was completed, droplets of water accumulated on the leaves and grass in the courtyard.

He was becoming increasingly powerful.

"My Daluo Blade is now perfect. The distance to the 'Fifteen Zhang' Qi Lake is neither far nor near."

"If I add another 'Tiered' martial art, it will be more than enough. Although Xu Liefeng is missing limbs and his strength is not what it used to be, he is still not to be underestimated."

"This man dares not resent the Madam, so he will inevitably vent his anger on me. In a month, the life-and-death struggle between me and him will be inevitable. I must improve my strength as soon as possible!"

Li Xian suppressed his joy and corrected his mindset.

***

In Qingning County.

A woman rode a horse, moving slowly through the streets.

She wore black clothes and a black bamboo hat. Black gauze hung from the brim of the hat, obscuring her face.

Although her face could not be seen, her temperament was undeniable. Walking on the street, she stood out like a crane among chickens, extremely eye-catching.

She wore a jade belt around her waist, from which hung a sachet and a jade pendant. On her feet were long boots made of beast hide, finely crafted with golden thread embroidered with phoenix patterns.

Lin Aoshan looked around. Seeing the state of Qingning County, she was slightly disappointed.

"This Qingning County is a tiny place, small and poor. As a Patrol Sky Marquis, I often travel everywhere. But such a poor place is truly rare."

Lin Aoshan entered Red Candle Street.

Seeing the street scene here, with tall buildings on both sides, bustling shops, and a flow of pedestrians, most dressed in brocade, she felt it had some style.

Her mood improved slightly. It was barely passable. She looked around, detached from the surroundings. When passing bustling shops, she glanced a bit more but never stopped.

Until she reached the gates of the Lin Mansion, she let out a "whoa" and stopped her horse.

"Summon Lin Guolong," Lin Aoshan said to the guards at the gate.

"Who are you? How dare you call the County Lord by his name!" the guard retorted.

Lin Aoshan said, "I am his grandmother."

The guard flew into a rage. He worked for the County Lord. This person didn't even put the County Lord in their eyes, wouldn't they treat him even worse? He immediately called for his brothers to surround her.

Just then, Lin Guolong returned from the yamen. Recognizing Lin Aoshan, he was startled and hurried to greet her, calling out, "Good Grandma, you have finally arrived!" He was both joyful and surprised, trying to curry favor.

The guards widened their eyes. Although they couldn't see the woman's face, looking at her figure, she didn't seem old at all.

"You blind dogs! Go get twenty strokes of the rod!" Lin Guolong scolded the men, then led the "Good Grandma" into the mansion.

Lin Aoshan had a good temper and didn't追究 further. If she had said one more word, these guards would have had a hard time surviving.

"Good Grandma, this humble grandson received a letter a few days ago saying you would grace us with your presence. I have been waiting for a long time, and today I have finally盼到了 you," Lin Guolong said fawningly.

"Outside, use my title. Call me Lord Xuanhou," Lin Aoshan said as she walked into the main hall, took off her hat, and placed her sword beside her.

Her red lips were like cherries, her moth-like eyebrows graceful. Her long hair was braided into a high ponytail, heroic and spirited.

"A few days ago, you captured twenty thousand prisoners?" Lin Aoshan got straight to the point.

"Yes," Lin Guolong said proudly.

"This matter is hard to explain in a letter. Tell me the details in person," Lin Aoshan said with interest.

"Of course, please have some tea first," Lin Guolong said, pouring tea for her. After wetting his throat, he recounted the entire process.

This time, he didn't dare to lie. Everything he said was the truth. How he defended the city, how he dealt with the Yellow Dragon Army...

When he mentioned "Li Xian," he couldn't help but sincerely praise him. He said Li Xian was truly a talent, exceptionally handsome and elegant, young in age, and quite accomplished in martial arts.

Lin Aoshan nodded slightly upon hearing this.

"Good, good... I didn't expect such a young man in this poor Qingning County," Lin Aoshan's eyes shone. Although she hadn't met him, the courage to shoot an enemy general must be remarkable.

"Taking the head of an enemy general is a military merit. Where is this young man? He should be rewarded for his merit."

She turned to look at Lin Guolong. "You defended the city gates, which is also a merit. I have reported to the Patrol Sky Division. Perhaps... I can transfer you to the prefectural city."

Lin Guolong was overjoyed upon hearing this.

The Patrol Sky Division was a special institution, responsible only to the current emperor. Its duties were to patrol the world and the martial world, and it also had the power to recommend people.

Although Lin Aoshan was young, her status in the clan was high, and she was already a Xuanhou of the Patrol Sky Division.

If she participated in this matter, her opinion would be sufficient to determine the reward.

***

Several days passed.

[Proficiency +2]
[Proficiency +1]
[Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword·First Layer]
[Proficiency: 5816/6000 Minor Accomplishment]

Li Xian practiced diligently, improving his martial arts. The Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword was nearing Great Accomplishment. Even without "Twin Swords Combined," he would soon be able to advance.

"Eating, nurturing, practicing, and soaking—this runs through the entire life of a martial artist. Each aspect has extremely deep knowledge."

"I don't worry about [Essential Treasures] now. There are still many left in the Sky-Containing Box. Consuming a portion daily is enough for me in the Consuming Essence realm."

"But... pills, I have to figure out myself. The pills in the Idle Pill Pavilion are for the guards, and they are of little use to me. If I want to truly eat good pills, I need to buy them from outside."

Li Xian sheathed his long sword and exhaled a hot breath. After calming his breathing, he took one gram of Essential Treasure as the Madam instructed.

[You consumed inferior Essential Meat, Proficiency +29]
[Skill: Consumption]
[Proficiency: 450/2000 Minor Accomplishment]
[Description: For anything that enters the mouth, beneficial effects are increased by 50%. Harmful effects are reduced by 20%.]

One gram of Essential Treasure meat entered his stomach, producing twenty strands of essence. The increased effect was thirty strands. Most of it tempered his physique and dissipated into the heavens and earth.

Only four or five strands remained in his body, dissolving into the blood and flesh, hiding deep within.

The multicolored light on his shoulders became more apparent.

The sound of a drumbeat faintly came from his chest. He was not far from "Chest Drum Thunder Sound."

He had already cleansed his fetal body. The characteristics of the Consuming Essence realm, fast or slow, would all appear one after another.

He had walked nine out of ten steps. The remaining ten steps were the simplest. He just needed to persist and continue as usual.

Hard practice was always tedious.

Li Xian put on his clothes and strolled around the manor. He walked up a hillside and lay down on the slope to catch the breeze.

It was July.

The summer heat was at its peak, and poisonous insects were active. As soon as Li Xian lay down, mosquitoes came to bite him. Li Xian had a clever idea and let out a faint thunder sound from his chest.

It really drove the insects away.

Li Xian clenched his right fist and struck his chest again. With a "thud," aided by external force, he barely achieved "Chest Drum Thunder Sound." The surrounding cicadas fell silent, wild rabbits went weak at the knees, and birds fell from the sky...

Chest Drum Thunder Sound... naturally suppressed these weak creatures.

Li Xian lay on the grass, very much at ease. He glanced at the Quiet Heart Pagoda. The Madam had been cultivating inside for several days.

He didn't dare to use his "Dual Pupils" to窥探. The last time he observed, the Madam had noticed. If there was a similar situation again, she definitely wouldn't just sit and wait.

"If my [Dual Pupils] were revealed, with the Madam's temperament, she definitely wouldn't be happy for me," Li Xian was very self-aware.

He looked around.

The sun was blazing. Many guards were cooling off under the trees. Because of the Yellow Dragon Army incident, many guards had died, and many new faces had been added.

Just then, Ding Hu hurriedly ran towards the Commander's courtyard.

"Commander Li, Commander Li, someone is looking for you outside the manor!" Ding Hu shouted, seeing no one in the courtyard. He called for the other guards to help look.

Li Xian came down from the hillside and appeared beside Ding Hu. "Who is looking for me?"

"You'll know when you go," Ding Hu said.

***

Outside the manor.

As soon as Li Xian walked out, he saw a crowd of people in front.

Lin Guolong, wearing an official robe, walked to the front. Behind him were many guards, county citizens, and some local gentry.

"Commander Li, congratulations," Lin Guolong cupped his hands and said.

Li Xian frowned. "What is there to congratulate?"

Lin Guolong said, "You probably don't know. You have quelled the rebellion and rendered great merit. After being reported by the Patrol Sky Division, you have been specially awarded a silk banner. Furthermore, you are appointed as an Eighth Rank Local Official, the position of Qingning Martial Captain."

Li Xian was stunned. Although he wasn't a soldier, his background was clean. Beheading the leader of the chaotic army was indeed a great merit. But the court was corrupt, with layers of exploitation. Very few people could actually receive the merit. He hadn't expected it and had completely forgotten about it.

However, he didn't know.

Normally, such merit would be stripped layer by layer. By the time it reached Lin Guolong, very little would be left.

But Lin Guolong was from the Poor Sky Lin Clan. The Lin family's influence was not weak, and Lin Aoshan was a "Patrol Sky Division" official who faced the emperor directly. With her巡视 and recommendation, the merit was securely awarded.

Li Xian's mind raced. He glanced at the Quiet Heart Pagoda, preparing words to refuse.

Suddenly, a voice came: "It's fine to accept it."

It was the Madam transmitting her voice using Qi.

Li Xian was stunned and said, "Since that's the case, I will accept it."

"Hahaha, good, good. From now on, we are colleagues!"

"Please take care of me, Brother Li."

"I have already set up a banquet at the 'Fairy Dream Building' in the county. Come into the city with us. As a new official, you should let the people of the county see what you look like."

Lin Guolong laughed, waved his hand, and a servant brought over a white horse adorned with red silk.

There was also a set of clothes tailored for him.

The Martial Captain rank is "Local Official Eighth Rank," a military official responsible for handling martial world affairs in the area and pursuing martial world criminals. The authority is neither too big nor too small, depending entirely on individual ability.

If one can suppress the scene, the limelight can even overshadow the County Lord.

Li Xian said, "Please wait a moment!"

"Understood, understood," Lin Guolong said with a smile. Watching Li Xian's back, he sighed. A true dragon cannot be confined in a shallow pool. When the wind and rain come, it will soar into the sky.

Back then, on his master's orders, he recommended Li Xian, promoting him from a B-rank guard to a commander. How long has it been? He is already able to be appointed as an official.

With his family's support, he himself is only a Local Official Seventh Grade.

Li Xian walked to the front of the Quiet Heart Pagoda.

Madam Wen's voice came: "You are young. It's always good to go out and experience more."

"Just don't forget your duties."

Li Xian said, "Thank you, Madam!"

Inside the Quiet Heart Pagoda, Madam Wen had her own calculations: "No matter how big a world you闯, in the end, it will all be mine. This child is gradually gaining momentum. If I strictly restrain him, it will be counterproductive. Let him go out,敲打 him occasionally, intimidate him with武力, and entice him with beauty. I will naturally subdue him."

"Besides, if he were a useless coward, what meaning would there be in keeping him by my side? Let him roam around. If he can actually achieve something, I will look at him with higher regard."

The Madam's weighing of pros and cons was always precise.

Her voice drifted down: "Go ahead. Don't lose my face. You can play with the Martial Captain position, but don't lose sight of the bigger picture."
