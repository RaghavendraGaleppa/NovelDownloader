# Chapter 91: Iron-Stem Orchid and Iron Orchid Fruit

After the shapeshifting spell was successfully bid on, Chu Ning lost interest in the subsequent auction items.

He didn't wait any longer and directly left the room.

Finding the attendant outside, Chu Ning spent 200 low-grade spirit stones to purchase the jade slip containing the Thousand Beasts Chart.

After waiting for a while and Lin Changqing still hadn't descended, Chu Ning decided to wander around Cloud Sea Pavilion.

Chu Ning's current focus was on talisman crafting and spiritual plant cultivation, so naturally, he gravitated towards these two categories.

In the talisman sales area, Chu Ning saw some high-grade basic talismans and even some mid-grade ones. However, he didn't have any immediate need for talismans of that sort. He then looked at the mid-grade basic talismans; there was indeed a wide variety. But in terms of talisman quality, none could compare to those he drew. This gave Chu Ning a slight sense of pride. When it came to talisman quality alone, truly no one could match his creations. In the end, besides buying ten boxes of talisman ink, he purchased nothing else.

Upon arriving at the spiritual plant sales area, Chu Ning's eyes lit up. This Cloud Sea Pavilion actually had many spiritual plants that he had only seen mentioned in the jade slips provided by He Changyou, but had never encountered in person. He couldn't help but examine them closely.

After walking a short distance, Chu Ning stopped before a spiritual plant about a foot tall with slender leaves. Immediately, an attendant stepped forward to introduce it.

“Fellow Daoist, this is the Iron-Stem Orchid, which our Cloud Sea Pavilion imported from another mountain range. This spiritual plant can be directly used as medicine and is one of the best auxiliary ingredients for refining blood-strengthening pills for body cultivators. Furthermore, if one is willing to cultivate it meticulously and invest some time, there is a certain probability that it will bear Iron Orchid Fruit. This Iron Orchid Fruit is an excellent spiritual medicine for body tempering.”

Chu Ning's expression remained unchanged by the attendant's words. His Ninefold Body Refinement Art was different from common body refinement cultivation methods and didn't rely much on external forces for tempering. Therefore, Chu Ning didn't pay much attention to the so-called tempering effect of the Iron Orchid Fruit. However, Chu Ning had learned about this spiritual plant from He Changyou's jade slips before, and another of its characteristics greatly interested him.

At this moment, the attendant continued his introduction. “Of course, cultivating this Iron-Stem Orchid requires absorbing a large amount of spiritual energy. Although its spiritual energy absorption rate is fast, if planted in an area with insufficient spiritual energy, the cultivation time will be very long. Moreover, whether it bears Iron Orchid Fruit is entirely a matter of probability; there is currently no known method to help it bear fruit. This point must also be made clear to fellow Daoist.”

Chu Ning nodded slightly. He already knew these details. The Iron-Stem Orchid’s high spiritual energy absorption was precisely why he stopped here. What he needed for his backyard were spiritual plants that absorbed spiritual energy quickly and in large quantities. He knew that when he cultivated the Azurewood Everspring Art with the aid of the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art, the more spiritual energy the plants absorbed, the greater the benefit he would gain from cultivation. He had previously considered planting some spiritual plants in one of his two backyards in Yanji Square to aid his cultivation of the Azurewood Everspring Art. However, the several types of seeds he brought from the sect were not very suitable. The Green Spirit Fruits he was currently cultivating could only be said to be just enough. After all, under normal circumstances, the faster and greater the spiritual energy a plant absorbed, the more precious it usually was. Moreover, higher quality spiritual plants often had more stringent requirements, such as planting intervals.

Since the Iron-Stem Orchid's fruit-bearing was uncertain, its price wasn't high. Chu Ning saw that the listed price was twenty spirit stones per plant. And Chu Ning had seen in previous jade slips that the Iron-Stem Orchid could even be planted very densely. Of course, the quality would be affected accordingly. However, for Chu Ning, these were not significant issues.

Chu Ning immediately asked the attendant, "How many Iron-Stem Orchids do you have here?"

The attendant paused slightly, then replied, "About 50 plants."

"50 plants, a thousand spirit stones," Chu Ning calculated silently, then asked, "Do you sell Iron-Stem Orchid seeds?"

The attendant shook his head. "This Iron-Stem Orchid is not a spiritual plant native to our Azure Gorge Mountain Range, and our pavilion doesn't have its seeds at the moment. If fellow Daoist has a need, our pavilion can also collect them on your behalf."

Chu Ning frowned slightly upon hearing this, then gritted his teeth and asked, "If I buy all 50 Iron-Stem Orchids, can the price be negotiated?"

"Buy all 50 together?" The attendant's eyes lit up. After thinking for a moment, he said to Chu Ning, "If you buy all 50 Iron-Stem Orchids together, I can apply to the pavilion for a price of 19 spirit stones per plant."

Chu Ning nodded. "Good, help me get these 50 Iron-Stem Orchids."

The attendant's smile widened. "Please wait, fellow Daoist, I will fetch them for you immediately." With that, the attendant swiftly departed.

In a short while, he returned with two large jade boxes.

"Fellow Daoist, all 50 Iron-Stem Orchids are now in these two jade boxes. If they are to be used as medicine, storing them in these jade boxes for a longer period is fine. If they are for planting, they must be transplanted within ten days, otherwise, their survival rate will be significantly lower."

Chu Ning nodded to indicate he understood, took the two jade boxes, and handed over 950 spirit stones to the attendant.

The attendant accepted the 950 spirit stones, a smile still on his face. "If fellow Daoist cultivates these Iron-Stem Orchids and obtains Iron Orchid Fruits, you can also bring them to our Cloud Sea Pavilion for sale. Our Cloud Sea Pavilion buys back all sorts of treasures at high prices..."

Chu Ning nodded noncommittally. He didn't know if Cloud Sea Pavilion's buy-back prices were high, but he knew their selling prices certainly weren't cheap. In less than half a day, he had already spent over two thousand eight hundred spirit stones. His talisman sales had been excellent during this period, but most of his spirit stones were now gone.

Chu Ning chose not to browse further and went straight down to the first floor to wait for Lin Changqing. Soon after, the auction concluded, and many Qi Refining stage cultivators left. Chu Ning waited for about a quarter of an hour before Lin Changqing came down from upstairs. Judging by his expression, his face was still cold, but there was a faint smile at the corner of his eyes, clearly indicating a fruitful trip.

Seeing Chu Ning, Lin Changqing casually asked, "Did you get what you wanted?"

"Yes, I did!"

After Chu Ning replied, Lin Changqing didn't ask further, simply nodding, "Then let's go back."

Lin Changqing didn't ask Chu Ning what he had purchased at the auction, and on the way back, he still allowed Chu Ning to sit on his flying boat. After another hour or so, the two returned to Yanji Square. Lin Changqing dropped Chu Ning off outside the shop and then departed on his boat.

Chu Ning returned to the shop and first went to the backyard to check. He found Ling Xiaobai still soundly asleep in the backyard, which put his mind at ease. Ling Xiaobai opened its eyes to glance at Chu Ning, then continued its deep slumber. Seeing this, Chu Ning ignored it and began to sort through the items he had bought from Cloud Sea Pavilion.

The Windchaser Shuttle was the first flying magic tool Chu Ning had ever bought at such a high price. It was about five feet long, pointed at both ends, with its widest part in the middle measuring about two and a half feet. There was enough space to either stand or sit comfortably on it. Although it was a bit expensive, the thought of being able to fly in the sky with a magic tool instead of relying on the Wind Manipulation Art every time filled Chu Ning with a little anticipation.

"Tomorrow, when I go to the spiritual field, I can certainly give it a try."

Chu Ning didn't take out the jade slip for the shapeshifting spell just yet; instead, he first took out the two jade boxes filled with Iron-Stem Orchids.

At 20 spirit stones per plant, these Iron-Stem Orchids were arguably the most precious spiritual plants Chu Ning had ever cultivated. In truth, as a spiritual medicine, it wasn't meant for large-scale planting like ordinary spiritual plants. Of course, for Chu Ning, who needed them for cultivation, in his eyes, they were just as valuable as any other common spiritual plant.

Chu Ning found a sufficiently spacious area, carefully took out the Iron-Stem Orchids one by one, and began planting them. Chu Ning planted them very densely in a circular area less than two zhang (approx. 6.6 meters) in diameter, leaving a space in the center where he could sit cross-legged. The outer perimeter was then filled with two concentric rings of the 50 Iron-Stem Orchids.

After all the Iron-Stem Orchids were planted, Chu Ning immediately formed a hand seal and cast the Raindrop Art. To be fair, his ordinary Raindrop Art still couldn't be cast instantly. Fortunately, it was sufficient for his needs.

Immediately after, Chu Ning instantly cast the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art, enveloping all 50 Iron-Stem Orchids. One cast of the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art yielded no reaction from the Iron-Stem Orchids, so Chu Ning continued casting. He cast it one after another, a full thirty times, before finally stopping. Then, with a hint of joy on his face, he looked at the Iron-Stem Orchids.

He had known before that these Iron-Stem Orchids had high requirements for spiritual energy absorption, but Chu Ning didn't have a very clear concept of it. Now, after casting the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art, Chu Ning immediately gained a more intuitive understanding. These Iron-Stem Orchids actually absorbed more spiritual energy than the Blood Sandalwood he encountered during the District C assessment.

However, because Blood Sandalwood trees grow large and stout, they require significant spacing when planted. Chu Ning’s backyard could only accommodate about two trees. So, even though a single tree absorbed a lot of spiritual energy, the limited number he could plant meant that its effect on his short-term Azurewood Spring Bloom Art cultivation would not be significant. This was also why Chu Ning had never considered planting Blood Sandalwood. Now, with the Iron-Stem Orchids being so small yet capable of absorbing so much spiritual energy with the aid of the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art, Chu Ning was both surprised and delighted. He could imagine that after a few days, when these Iron-Stem Orchids grew normally, casting the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art to aid his cultivation would yield an effect far surpassing that of any other spiritual plants he had used before.

At this moment, Ling Xiaobai was also startled awake by the commotion from Chu Ning's spellcasting. It looked at the Iron-Stem Orchids, then let out an "ying" sound towards Chu Ning. Chu Ning was momentarily stunned by the "ying" sound, until Ling Xiaobai expressed "want to eat" through spiritual sense, and then he understood. He asked with a smile, "You want to eat the fruit grown by these Iron-Stem Orchids?"

Ling Xiaobai let out another "ying," confirming its desire.

Chu Ning smiled and shook his head. "I want them to bear some fruit too, but the key is whether they can actually grow any." Both the jade slip given by He Changyou and the attendant at Cloud Sea Pavilion had mentioned it. The flowering and fruiting of the Iron Orchid Fruit were entirely matters of probability. Otherwise, the Iron-Stem Orchid wouldn't be called the Iron-Stem Orchid; it would just be called the Iron Orchid Fruit directly. If bearing Iron Orchid Fruit could be achieved by improving quality, Chu Ning would have absolute confidence with his Azurewood Spring Bloom Art. But for such an unpredictable, accidental event, Chu Ning could only hope he was a Child of Fortune.

Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, Ling Xiaobai blinked its two adorable eyes and began to circle the ring of Iron-Stem Orchids. Then, to Chu Ning's slightly dumbfounded gaze, it simply lifted a leg.

And peed.

"I was planning to cultivate in there! Can't you hold it and go somewhere else? Even peeing on the Magnolia Fruit would be better than here." Chu Ning glared at Ling Xiaobai, feeling both exasperated and amused. The latter merely let out an "ying" towards Chu Ning, then nonchalantly walked away and lay down on the ground again, seemingly preparing for another nap.

"I hope your pee won't harm these spiritual plants, little fellow," Chu Ning could only shake his head helplessly, ignoring the creature, and left the backyard.

Starting a fire for cooking, Chu Ning cooked spiritual rice while examining the Thousand Beasts Chart jade slip he had bought from Cloud Sea Pavilion today. It indeed contained a vast amount of information on demonic and spiritual beasts. Not only were there written descriptions, but also lifelike illustrations for each. As he only wanted to see if there was any information about Ling Xiaobai, Chu Ning browsed through it very quickly. After completing a full browse, Chu Ning put down the jade slip, somewhat disappointed. The Thousand Beasts Chart indeed contained much information about spiritual beasts and demonic beasts, but Chu Ning had read through the entire jade slip without finding any record related to Ling Xiaobai.

"However, this jade slip does contain a lot of information on the classification of spiritual and demonic beasts." Chu Ning held the jade slip, lost in thought. According to the jade slip, there wasn't a significant distinction between spiritual beasts and demonic beasts in the current cultivation world. Cultivators were accustomed to calling those they raised "spiritual beasts" and those living wild "demonic beasts." However, in ancient times, only those born with special divine abilities, accompanying heaven and earth, were called "spiritual beasts." Such spiritual beasts, as long as they matured slightly, generally could reach the sixth rank or higher. The rank of a spiritual or demonic beast was equivalent to a Golden Core stage cultivator.

But even at the sixth rank or above, if they didn't possess special innate talents, they could only be called demonic beasts. However, with the decline of these heaven-and-earth spiritual beasts, the terminology gradually changed. And spiritual beasts with special divine abilities are now referred to as "Ancient Spiritual Beasts" in the current cultivation world. Besides these descriptions of spiritual and demonic beasts, the Thousand Beasts Chart also had many general descriptions of demonic beasts. It allowed Chu Ning to gain a relatively comprehensive understanding of demonic beasts for the first time. Although the ranks of these demonic beasts were generally below the fifth rank, with only a very small portion reaching the sixth rank, Chu Ning didn't feel the 200 spirit stones were not worth it. He was just a little disappointed that he hadn't found any relevant information about Ling Xiaobai.

Fortunately, Ling Xiaobai had been here for a day or two, and Chu Ning hadn't discovered too many downsides for now, so he wasn't in a hurry. He hoped to find some higher-level books about spiritual and demonic beasts in the future. Chu Ning always felt that Ling Xiaobai seemed extraordinary, yet its observed rank was very low, which was quite strange.
