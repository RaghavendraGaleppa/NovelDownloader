# Chapter 72: Requesting from an Inner Sect Senior Brother

“To become a Spirit Farmer at such a young age, your talent is indeed outstanding, but even the most astonishing talent has its limits! Young man, you need to be tempered…”

Shuimen smiled at Ding Rui, pondered for a moment, and then asked, “Junior Brother, you must have just become a Spirit Farmer, right? As a senior who's been through it, I have some insights and experience in cultivating spirit fields.”

“How about this, Junior Brother, tell me, what was your total harvest from your spirit field this time?” Shuimen said, a hint of pride on his face. “When I started, I wasn't considered exceptional, and my first harvest after becoming a Spirit Farmer was only 1.5 million grains of spirit rice.”

1.5 million grains of spirit rice, for a first harvest, was already considered quite excellent.

“Now you should know there are always people stronger than you, and heavens beyond heavens…” Shuimen secretly observed Ding Rui, thinking proudly.

Dongfeng's eyes lit up upon hearing Shuimen's words. He immediately said, “Exactly, Junior Brother Ding Rui, if your harvest this time reaches 2 million, I'll agree to help you apply to the sect's supervising senior brother to see if you can try managing a field by yourself. But if you can't achieve such results, my rash application would be in vain, and I'd get scolded too!”

“Now you're stuck, aren't you? I really don't believe any Spirit Farmer's first harvest can exceed two million. Some Spirit Farmers who've been in the spirit fields for over ten years might not even achieve such results, and you even used a portion of your spirit field to plant Meridian-Opening Flowers!” Dongfeng thought to himself.

He was confident that Ding Rui would retreat in the face of difficulty.

A moment later, another cultivator's head peeked in, scanned the spirit field, and fixed his gaze on Ding Rui, chuckling, “Junior Brother Ding, come quickly and help collect your harvest.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the outer sect disciple responsible for the harvest retracted his head, then another sack of spirit rice was thrown in.

*Thump!* Another sound.

“Senior Brothers, I'll go move my spirit rice in first; we can talk about the other matter later.”

Ding Rui told Dongfeng and Shuimen, then quickly ran to help.

“These harvesting junior brothers came at just the right time. It's like directly showcasing Ding Rui's harvest, saving him the trouble of announcing it himself, which gives him some face,” Dongfeng thought as he watched Ding Rui and the harvesting disciples busy themselves. Then he suddenly felt it wasn't good for him to just stand there.

So, he rolled up his sleeves and walked over. Shuimen saw this, quickly rolled up his own sleeves, and followed.

Sacks filled with spirit rice were swiftly moved from the floating ship outside and then thrown into the spirit field, one after another. Because Ding Rui was the most recent cultivator to become a Spirit Farmer, Spirit Field 520 was also the newest spirit field in the entire Xuanfu Sect.

One of the harvesting disciples, hearing this, immediately brightened and said, “You've asked the right person! I have to say, Junior Brother Ding Rui is indeed a genius Spirit Farmer! This is his first time as a Spirit Farmer, and he managed to harvest 1.7 million grains of spirit rice in one go, not counting the odd bits. This is his *first* harvest as a Spirit Farmer, isn't that amazing?!”

Shuimen's heart trembled. Over 1.7 million grains!

That was 200,000 grains more than his 1.5 million!
