# Chapter 65: Killing the Body and Destroying the Soul

Wang Chan wasn't supposed to be just some wilderness rogue cultivator, was he?  

Using ten mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans without batting an eye—that was over a thousand spirit coins!  

Where did he get such wealth?  

Even He Changkong himself didn't have ten mid-grade talismans on him in total.  

Watching Wang Chan leisurely sip on Spirit Nourishing Elixir, slap mid-grade Qi Recovery Talismans on himself, and pop low-grade Qi Recovery Pills into his mouth, He Changkong realized that Wang Chan was planning to drag this into a battle of attrition, aiming to exhaust his mana.  

If He Changkong recklessly burned through his mana in a frenzy, he would be the one to die.  

Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, He Changkong took a deep breath and stowed his seal back into his storage pouch. Then, he spat out a mouthful of essence blood, which transformed into a mist of blood that enveloped him. A sinister chant echoed through the cavern.  

"Brother Wang, run!"  

Hearing the chant, Su Jue—who had been stunned into silence by Wang Chan's ruthless methods—snapped back to reality and screamed a warning at Wang Chan.  

But it was already too late.  

Before Su Jue's warning even fully left her lips, He Changkong's skin turned blood-red, peeling away from his body and transforming into a crimson light that ignored the five-layered Earth Prison Talisman's defenses.  

In a flash, it lunged straight at Wang Chan.  

"No!" Su Jue covered her face with her hands, shrieking as if she could already foresee Wang Chan's gruesome fate.  

Just as the blood-light was about to engulf Wang Chan, a series of crackling sounds erupted, accompanied by sizzling thunder.  

A white lightning net burst from Wang Chan's body, expanding before swiftly closing in, trapping the blood-light within it.  

"Seal!"  

With Wang Chan's sharp command, the lightning net abruptly tightened.  

In an instant, the blood-light was completely restrained, writhing and morphing wildly but unable to escape.  

"Refine!"  

Wang Chan barked another order. The lightning net crackled with arcs of electricity, sizzling violently.  

"Break!"  

Three white needles shot out from his sleeve, merging into the lightning net and piercing the blood-light.  

Ten breaths later.  

The lightning net, now condensed into a dense ball of thunder, exploded with a loud bang.  

Countless threads of lightning scattered in all directions.  

Seeing that Su Jue was about to be caught in the blast, Wang Chan moved in front of her in a flash, sweeping his sleeve to gather the stray lightning threads.  

When the dust settled, the blood-light was gone.  

Wang Chan let out a long exhale and turned his gaze beyond the Earth Prison Talisman's barrier.  

---  

There, He Changkong—who had just shed his bloody skin—had somehow regrown a new layer of skin, as tender and smooth as a newborn's.  

It was unclear how that bloody skin had been refined, but now that it had been destroyed by Wang Chan, He Changkong's face was deathly pale, his eyes dull and lifeless.  

Wang Chan's inexplicable lightning-based sealing technique and thunder force were a perfect counter to his blood-cultivation arts, rendering his abilities half as effective.  

Moreover, judging by Wang Chan's relaxed demeanor, it seemed he still had more tricks up his sleeve.  

Meanwhile, He Changkong was already exhausted.  

Having exhausted all his techniques and still failing to defeat his opponent, he knew it was time to retreat. If he stayed any longer, he wouldn't be able to escape once Wang Chan turned his full attention on him.  

Furthermore, Su Jue's betrayal had shattered his purity. His once-immaculate mental state was now tainted, his obsession shaken. Even with the Purple Talisman suppressing his inner demons, he was teetering on the edge of qi deviation.  

And that Purple Talisman was incredibly precious. Over the years, he had scoured everywhere and only managed to acquire a few. The one he had just used was his last.  

If he lingered any longer and something went wrong, it would be disastrous.  

Most importantly, he needed to leave immediately and find another pure woman to serve as the anchor for his obsession—otherwise, his inner demons would consume him.  

As for the power within Su Jue, there was still time. The future was long.  

But before he left, he couldn't let Wang Chan walk away unscathed.  

"Wang Chan, do you know why I targeted you last time?" He Changkong asked, pulling out a mid-grade Water Talisman. "Because Bai Shaofeng wants you dead!"  

"Bai Shaofeng?" Wang Chan narrowed his eyes, a bad feeling rising in his chest.  

According to the bearded man's intel, He Changkong had indeed pledged allegiance to Bai Shaofeng.  

But why would Bai Shaofeng want him dead?  

What grudge did they have?  

He and the beauty-marked woman hadn't even gotten close yet.  

But now that He Changkong mentioned it, Wang Chan couldn't help but feel suspicious.  

The last time he met Bai Shaofeng, the man had been overly friendly and accommodating.  

For the direct descendant of a Foundation Establishment clan to remember an obscure rogue cultivator like him after just one meeting—and to be so amiable—was unnatural in itself.  

So why had Bai Shaofeng remembered him?  

Thinking back, they had only met twice.  

The first time, Wang Chan had been treating the beauty-marked woman. Though he had been professional, they had been alone together...  

A realization struck him.  

No way.  

Keeping his expression neutral, Wang Chan said, "I have no enmity with Brother Bai. Would you care to explain, Brother He?"  

"Hah! I have nothing more to say. If you're so curious, why not ask Bai Shaofeng yourself? Maybe I'm just lying to mess with you!" He Changkong laughed wildly.  

Seeing that Wang Chan remained outwardly calm but had still asked the question, He Changkong knew he had planted a thorn in the man's heart.  

At least he had salvaged some pride.  

Watching He Changkong's smug face, Wang Chan wanted nothing more than to finish him off.  

But his mana was nearly depleted, and with He Changkong's blood-shadow escape technique, he likely wouldn't be able to stop him from fleeing.  

Still, letting him leave so arrogantly was unacceptable.  

For some reason, Wang Chan felt an inexplicable surge of anger. In a flash, he appeared in front of Su Jue.  

Su Jue was kneeling on the jade bed, her mind in turmoil as she watched the man she feared—He Changkong—being forced into retreat by Wang Chan, reduced to empty threats.  

When Wang Chan suddenly appeared before her, she gasped softly in surprise.  

Then, looking down at her, Wang Chan gently patted her head.  

Her eyes widened as she glanced up.  

Outside the Earth Prison Talisman's barrier, He Changkong—who had been about to activate his Water Talisman—froze at the sight, his face twisting grotesquely in rage.  

"Whore!"  

In that instant, Su Jue became a blade stabbing straight into He Changkong's heart, tearing him apart.  

As he let out a heart-wrenching roar, the Purple Talisman suppressing his inner demons at his brow suddenly ignited, burning away.  

His eyes bulged, and he lunged forward—  

But after just half a step,  

Blood-cultivation mana erupted uncontrollably from his body.  

"Qi deviation...!"  

Wang Chan, recognizing the signs, sucked in a sharp breath.  

As a fellow demonic cultivator, he knew He Changkong's demonic thoughts and blood-cultivation mana had gone berserk, beyond control.  

Before he could finish his sentence, He Changkong's body exploded into a bloody mist.  

Not taking any chances, Wang Chan immediately directed the white needles hovering outside the barrier to pierce the mist.  

Thunder crackled.  

Soon, the mist dissipated completely.  

Only a storage pouch remained on the ground.  

Thinking about the ten Earth Prison Talismans he had wasted in this battle, Wang Chan felt a pang of regret. He was about to retrieve the pouch when Su Jue—wild and mischievous—forced him back into another kind of battle.  

At the same time.  

Black River Market.  

Ah Wei, who had been loitering near Langyun Teahouse, inexplicably exploded into a bloody mist, terrifying two female cultivators so badly they wet themselves. Chaos erupted, and soon, patrolling guards arrived.
