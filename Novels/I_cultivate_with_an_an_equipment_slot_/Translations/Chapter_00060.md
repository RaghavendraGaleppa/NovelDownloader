# Chapter 60: Zhuge Wan: I Am Proud  

The quality of the spiritual fields provided by the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace was uniform—this was something they couldn't cheat on under everyone's watchful eyes.  

Zhang Yan casually selected one acre of spiritual land.  

In truth, the most crucial aspect of this competition was the choice of spiritual plants. Due to the limited time, some plants simply couldn't be selected. Most ordinary spiritual plant cultivators could only opt for the most basic spiritual rice, which matured in exactly three months.  

"The Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace might use the 'Flower Grafting' technique. Be careful," Zhuge Wan whispered to Zhang Yan.  

"Flower Grafting?"  

Zhang Yan understood what she meant.  

The Flower Grafting technique, though seemingly harmless, allowed two spiritual plants to grow together, similar to grafting. The benefits were numerous:  

First, it increased yield.  
Second, it enhanced resistance to disease and pests.  
Third…  

In short, this technique offered tremendous advantages with almost no drawbacks.  

It was precisely because of this technique that the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace had rarely lost in this stage of the competition.  

If Zhang Yan wanted to secure first place, he would need to employ some unconventional methods.  

"I’ll choose Earth Spirit Potatoes, Spirit Melons, Purple Corn, and… Jade Grass," Zhang Yan announced as he arrived at the seed distribution area.  

"So many?"  

The cultivator in charge of distributing the seeds gave him a surprised look but merely muttered under his breath before quickly retrieving the requested seeds.  

"Thank you!"  

Zhang Yan nodded slightly and returned to his designated spiritual field with the seeds.  

Yes, he intended to cultivate four different crops in this single acre of land.  

To win, he needed to maximize the field's potential—planting just one type of crop wouldn’t suffice.  

For instance, Earth Spirit Potatoes grew underground.  
Purple Corn thrived high above the ground.  
Spirit Melons and Jade Grass were low-lying and mid-level plants, respectively.  

In theory, these four could coexist in the same field. However, in practice, the limited spiritual energy of a single acre made it nearly impossible to sustain all four simultaneously.  

Such high-density planting could even lead to reduced yields and damage to the spiritual field.  

But Zhang Yan didn’t care—this wasn’t his field, after all.  

Why should he worry about someone else’s property?  

He was going all out.  

If he wouldn’t go hard on his own, why hold back on someone else’s?  

As for the issue of insufficient spiritual energy—Zhang Yan had his own solution.  

---  

**Don’t forget, his Spiritual Rain Technique was also at the Perfection stage…**  

Once the competition began, Zhang Yan smoothly planted the seeds of the various spiritual plants.  

During this time, elders from the major sects observed the proceedings.  

Each participant had a dedicated referee recording their every move with a Memory Stone.  

Watching Zhang Yan busily planting four different types of seeds, the referee assigned to him nearly lost his temper.  

*Who taught you to plant like this?*  

*Are you here to sabotage the competition?*  

But Zhang Yan’s next move left the referee utterly dumbfounded.  

With a single gesture, Zhang Yan cast the Spiritual Rain Technique (Perfection).  

A miniature dark cloud formed precisely over his field—not an inch too much, not an inch too little.  

Then, rain began to pour down.  

"Perfection-stage Spiritual Rain Technique?! What the—?!"  

The referee could only scream internally.  

This was a **Perfection-stage** technique!  

It was important to note that the Spiritual Plant Competition was divided into tiers—Foundation Establishment cultivators competed against their peers, and Qi Refining cultivators against theirs.  

The likes of Mu Sen and other Foundation Establishment cultivators had arrived at the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace much earlier.  

Their competition lasted nearly a year, not just three months. That was why Zhang Yan hadn’t seen Mu Sen this time.  

Had Mu Sen and the others competed alongside Zhang Yan, the Qi Refining cultivators would have stood no chance.  

After all, Foundation Establishment cultivators almost always mastered Perfection-stage techniques.  

Some had even achieved Perfection-stage techniques during Qi Refining, which later evolved into divine abilities after breaking through to Foundation Establishment.  

A single production or support-type divine ability could easily overshadow Zhang Yan’s efforts.  

Come to think of it, it had been a while since he’d last seen Mu Sen.  

He wondered what his senior brothers were up to.  

Moreover, their master seemed unusually at ease with them—she hadn’t checked on them in so long.  

Yet she kept a close eye on **him** every single day.  

What he didn’t know was that Zhuge Wan had long given up on Mu Sen and the others.  

Her hopes now rested entirely on Zhang Yan.  

And most importantly—her senior sister’s daughter was also a Qi Refining cultivator, competing in the same tier!  

---  

Under the nourishment of the Perfection-stage Spiritual Rain Technique, the seeds Zhang Yan had planted sprouted rapidly.  

Watching the lush green shoots emerge from the soil, Zhang Yan waved his hand again.  

**Wood Essence Technique!**  

The Wood Essence Technique was inherently a single-target spell. Using it on multiple targets would significantly weaken its effects.  

But Zhang Yan didn’t care.  

After all, it was just one acre of land.  

He could simply cast the spell repeatedly.  

"Another Perfection-stage technique?!?!"  

The referee assigned to Zhang Yan was on the verge of losing his mind.  

*Since when were Perfection-stage techniques so easy to master?!*  

At least the ones Zhang Yan had learned were all farming-related spells with no offensive capabilities.  

Otherwise, once this guy reached Foundation Establishment, wouldn’t he be unstoppable?  

Zhuge Wan, however, wasn’t surprised by Zhang Yan’s second Perfection-stage technique.  

She had already gotten over the shock.  

She knew Zhang Yan had mastered the Wood Essence Technique to Perfection. So when he revealed his Perfection-stage Spiritual Rain Technique, she realized he had at least two Perfection-stage spells under his belt.  

"Two Perfection-stage techniques at this age… What kind of monster is he?"  

Zhuge Wan took a deep breath to suppress the joy bubbling in her heart.  

As a Golden Core cultivator, she could always maintain her composure—except when facing her senior sister.  

Yet today, for some reason, the corners of her lips kept curling upward.  

If anyone asked why, her answer was simple:  

**She was proud.**  

---  

Time flew by.  

By the one-month mark of the competition, the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace introduced pests to the fields.  

After all, simple cultivation wasn’t exciting enough.  

This time, the pests released were particularly interesting—a type of aphid-like insect.  

They were tiny, swift, and agile. Most spells couldn’t even hit them, and even if they did, the pests’ hard shells made them difficult to kill in one strike.  

Thus, the standard approach was to use the correct pesticides.  

That was the basic strategy, and most participants followed it.  

But when it came to Zhang Yan, the situation took a sharp turn.  

Zhang Yan: "What? You need pesticides for these puny bugs??"
