# Chapter 28: Secrets of the Past, the Guardian!

Darkness enveloped his vision.

After an unknown length of time, Li Zhengjing slowly opened his eyes, only to feel an excruciating pain in his left arm.

His vision was hazy as memories of what had happened gradually returned to him.

He finally understood why the wall-climbing bird had shrieked incessantly, preferring to risk death in the Thunder Prison Forbidden Zone rather than undergo the transformation!

He also finally grasped the meaning behind the incomplete sentence the bird had uttered before being knocked unconscious.

"So this old man performs surgeries without anesthesia?!" Li Zhengjing cursed inwardly. "No wonder that bird was so desperate to die... I can barely endure just having my hand transformed, but that bird had its entire body remade from head to toe."

Taking a deep breath, he felt the sharp pain in his left hand and immediately circulated his internal energy to sit up.

But just then, he froze.

Because outside, clear voices reached his ears.

"Daoist Yan, it's been ten years. You remain as distinguished as ever." It was the voice of the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official.

"Spiritual Official, after ten years, you've changed quite a bit. I wonder how much of your body is still original?" came a robust, aged voice, full of vitality and strength, spoken with a laugh.

"Daoist Yan's perspective is too narrow. As long as my brain remains, I am still the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official."

"That is true." Daoist Yan acknowledged before asking, "Why have you summoned me down the mountain this time?"

"The young man outside is named Fan Kaihu." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official spoke slowly. "He is the gift I've been crafting over the past seventeen years."

"I thought it would take another three years for this gift to be complete?" Daoist Yan's voice carried a hint of surprise.

"What I needed to do is already done." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official replied. "There are merely 18,763 meridians that haven't fully matured yet. Take him back, nurture him for three more years, and once time has settled his bloodline, he will be ready."

"If Fan Kaihu isn't fully matured, you should continue nurturing him until he is!" Daoist Yan's tone turned cold. "Back then, we allowed you to remain in seclusion within the territory of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect on the condition that you deliver a complete 'Spiritual Formation Physique'—not a defective one!"

"I'm leaving today." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official stated flatly.

"You can't wait three more years?" Daoist Yan asked.

"No." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official replied.

"Then I must report this to the sect." Daoist Yan fell silent for a moment. "Your reputation outside is... less than favorable, marked as a heretic. Back then, out of gratitude, the sect—on Elder Bai Xiao's suggestion—allowed you to stay after much deliberation among the Sect Master and the various peak leaders. Now that you wish to leave, the higher-ups must decide."

"Very well." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said. "I'll await your response. Fan Kaihu is outside—you may take him now."

Daoist Yan said nothing further and turned to leave the apothecary.

Inside, Li Zhengjing frowned slightly.

A moment later, a dragon's claw lifted the curtain.

"Awake?" The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official entered, his benevolent smile still carrying an eerie chill.

He approached and said slowly, "Earlier, I concealed your presence. Daoist Yan didn't notice you. Now he's returning to prepare for my execution, so... I'd like your help."

Li Zhengjing looked puzzled but remained silent.

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official didn't press for an answer. Instead, he rummaged through cabinets as if searching for something while continuing to speak.

"Seventeen years ago, I fought in Fengdu Mountain and saved many disciples of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. In return, they allowed me to stay here in seclusion."

"But in truth, my reputation is tarnished. The sect's higher-ups, proud as they are, believed that not hunting me down as a demon was already an act of great mercy—a repayment of my kindness."

"Thus, the majority opposed my staying here at the time."

"Back then, I was in the midst of further modifying my body and had no means of self-defense. I had no choice but to seek the sect's protection."

"In desperation, to show sincerity, I asked Elder Bai Xiao to secretly offer gifts to those who opposed me."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official seemed to find what he was looking for and retrieved it before turning to Li Zhengjing. "The master of the Formation Pavilion demanded the most unusual gift, which is why it remains unfinished to this day..."

Li Zhengjing suddenly understood. "Fan Kaihu is the unfinished gift you were supposed to deliver?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official nodded. "Now that Daoist Yan has taken him, it's time for me to leave the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect."

He chuckled, revealing his jagged teeth. "But I know that to some among the sect's higher-ups, my departure means the debt is settled—and so is my life."

Li Zhengjing murmured, "Which means it's time to slay the heretic."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official laughed. "More accurately, time to silence me."

He glanced outside. "Take Fan Kaihu, for example. He was crafted using demonic methods. For the Formation Pavilion Master, such a stain is a vulnerability. How could he allow me to leave alive?"

Li Zhengjing fell silent for a long moment. "So now... I also know his secret?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official smiled. "He came here in person to demand this gift and took it himself to ensure no one else knew. Right now, within the sect, apart from him, you're the only one who knows."

Li Zhengjing took a deep breath, realizing the old man had no intention of playing fair. "How can I help you, Senior?"

His words seemed to carry an unspoken question: *What's in it for me?*

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official's face twisted into a grin that was meant to be kind but only sent shivers down one's spine.

"I need you to escort me beyond the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's territory."

"I know that as a sect disciple, helping me will earn you enemies among the higher-ups..."

With that, he tossed the object he had retrieved onto Li Zhengjing.

"Wear this Wuchang Ghost Mask, and no one will recognize you."

"My identity can be hidden, but my cultivation is too weak for such a task," Li Zhengjing said hesitantly as he caught the mask.

"With your current abilities, you can handle anyone below the 'True Qi' realm," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official replied.

Li Zhengjing was stunned. *Am I really that strong after gaining a divine ability?*

"You were already strong to begin with." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official raised his right hand, revealing a freshly stitched wound. "When I cut into your arm, your internal energy—or rather, your sword qi—instantly pierced through my hand."

"What...?" Li Zhengjing's eyes flickered with uncertainty.

"Your internal energy is inherently domineering, yet you've refined it into sword qi, making it sharper and fiercer than anything I've ever seen," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official remarked.

Li Zhengjing remained silent.

"To my knowledge, the only sword art with such devastating sharpness is the Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi, the Kunlun Immortal Sect's forbidden technique," the old man said calmly.

Li Zhengjing didn't deny it.

"This sword art has been sealed by the Kunlun Immortal Sect. Throughout history, every practitioner of it has met a tragic end."

"The technique is too sharp and overbearing. Normally, only those who've reached the 'True Qi Manifestation, Hundred Meridians Unblocked' stage can cultivate it."

"Moreover, practicing such techniques at the 'Internal Energy' stage prevents external manifestation of power and slows cultivation progress."

"As far as I know, you're likely the first person in history to cultivate such a sword art at the Internal Energy stage."

"Of course, you're also the first human to wield the Divine Fire ability at this stage. In comparison, this isn't too surprising."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official's golden eyes gleamed as he asked, "I won't ask how you obtained this technique. But tell me—do you know death is coming for you?"

Li Zhengjing nodded. "I know."

"I can temporarily preserve your life," the old man said.

"How?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"I can give you a Sword-Nurturing Art." He reached into his robe and produced a thin manual. "With this, you can store the excessively sharp sword qi in your left arm's 36,500 muscle fibers, using it as spiritual energy."

"This way, the divine ability of your left arm will become even more formidable."

"More importantly, your organs won't be shredded by the sword qi, sparing you a death of a thousand perforations."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official stepped closer. "So, will you help me?"
