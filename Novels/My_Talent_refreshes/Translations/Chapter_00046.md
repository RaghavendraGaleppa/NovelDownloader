# Chapter 46: The Unwithering Bones and Spirit Refinement Art

After storing the Spirit Refinement Art jade slip in his storage pouch, Chu Ning turned his attention to the final bamboo token. 

The token was made from ordinary bamboo, not spiritual bamboo at all. A crude pattern was carved on it—just some random lines without any discernible order to Chu Ning's eyes. He examined it thoroughly but found nothing special about it. Had it not been in Qi Chongmao's storage pouch, Chu Ning wouldn't have given this ordinary token a second glance.

Attempts to activate it with spiritual power yielded no results. After careful study revealed nothing, Chu Ning simply returned it to his storage pouch.

Chu Ning pondered silently. Given Qi Chongmao's many secrets, he clearly wasn't an ordinary cultivator. The question was whether he had connections with any powerful figures in the sect. If so, an investigation might bring trouble. As neighbors, even with perfect concealment, suspicions might still arise.

Yet Chu Ning felt no regret. Had he not acted decisively, he would have been the one reduced to ashes.

Reviewing the battle, Chu Ning realized that while his expenditures were significant, his gains were substantial too. He'd used six talismans but recovered two along with two bottles of pills. Most importantly, he'd obtained the Spirit Refinement Art.

Rather than immediately practicing the new technique, Chu Ning sat cross-legged to restore his spiritual energy, depleted from the day's exertions—especially the Threefold Heavenly Fist technique which had consumed over thirty percent.

After several cycles of the Evergreen Wood Technique restored his energy, seeing it was still midnight, Chu Ning retired to sleep. The past ten days of guarding the Seven Star Spirit Fruit had left him exhausted, without proper rest.

He slept deeply and peacefully, not waking until mid-morning. Exiting his courtyard, he paused outside, observing carefully. No abnormalities appeared, and no one seemed to be looking for Qi Chongmao, easing his concerns—at least for now, last night's events remained undiscovered.

Having neglected his spirit fields for over ten days, Chu Ning headed straight there. Upon reaching the medium-grade field of Purple Vine Grass, his expression darkened.

The grass hadn't grown but instead showed signs of withering—clearly problematic. Closer inspection revealed bite marks from Rice Borer Insects, common pests that particularly target grass and grain-type spirit plants, reproducing rapidly.

Identifying the cause actually reassured Chu Ning—treatable as long as the plants weren't dead. Casting Purification Spells, he removed all insect eggs, then followed with Sweet Dew Spells to temporarily resolve the infestation. For full recovery, Wood Spring Art would be needed—his specialty.

However, Chu Ning had no time for that now. After treating all affected areas across several acres, he hurried to his five acres of premium-grade Black Spirit Bamboo—his real income source.

Relief washed over him—the bamboo grew normally. Though slightly slower without his Wood Spring Art, it showed no pest damage. Thus, Chu Ning spent the entire day alternating between fields—casting Wood Spring Art, restoring energy, then repeating until all plants were treated before leisurely returning home.

Qi Chongmao's courtyard remained shut with no signs of visitors. This seemed normal—Chu Ning himself had gone unnoticed for over ten days. Such was the freedom of outer sect disciples—aside from occasional checks by deacon Zhuang Yunde, the sect largely left them alone. Stewards like He Changyou only appeared during harvest or planting seasons.

After a brief, seemingly casual glance, Chu Ning returned home. He cooked spirit rice with two side dishes for a satisfying dinner. Resting briefly, he moved to the front yard for cultivation—the backyard, scene of last night's killing, felt uncomfortable now.

Uncertain how long Spirit Refinement Art would take, Chu Ning first practiced the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art's first volume's second stage—Unwithering Bones. As spiritual energy circulated through his meridians with each posture, warmth surged through his limbs. 

Assuming this was normal for the new stage, he completed two full cycles feeling refreshed—then started at his progress:

[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Low Grade), 2nd Layer (244/900)]
[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, Volume 1, Unwithering Bones 2/600]

"Such progress...?" Two cycles had advanced Unwithering Bones by two points—faster than even his initial Bone Tempering progress. Recalling the sensation resembling his Seven Star Spirit Fruit-enhanced training, realization dawned.

"Could residual effects remain from the fruit?" The fruit was meant for late-stage body tempering—his early use must have left excess energy. Smiling, he resolved to intensify training to fully absorb the fruit's benefits.

But first, curiosity about the Spirit Refinement Art called. Retrieving the jade slip, he reviewed its contents before closing his eyes to begin practice.
