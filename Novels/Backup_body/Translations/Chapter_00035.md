# Chapter 35: The Verdict of Elder Chen's Suicide! The Return of Yuan Zhengfeng's Remains!

In the inner courtyard of Gu Yue Peak within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, Li Zhengjing was finally acquitted and released, returning to his residence with a sigh.

"That fool Chen Yang was so sure I was the murderer, determined to find solid evidence to convict me," he muttered, gazing at the sky. "I waited half a day in the Law Enforcement Hall for nothing but an acquittal. How dull."

Hearing this, the white bird that had been pretending to be ordinary all day rolled its eyes. The Five Elements Creation Tree, which had also been masquerading as a regular potted plant, retracted its roots and stayed silent. Both silently cursed in their minds: *"Acting all smug after getting off scot-free—what a shameless brat."*

Suddenly, Li Zhengjing sneezed and narrowed his eyes at the bird and the tree. "Were you two just badmouthing me?"

"Your Lordship is wise! In my heart, you are mighty and heroic!" the bird chirped sweetly.

"Your Lordship is wise! In my heart—" The tree hastily extended its roots, waving them as it tried to speak, but it was too late. A flash of cold steel swept past, and Li Zhengjing calmly collected two severed roots.

*"Another two bowls of Five Elements Creation Paste,"* he mused.

Just as he was about to start boiling the paste, a voice called from outside the door. "It's me, Elder Gao Changhe."

"Elder Gao, please come in!" Li Zhengjing quickly stashed the roots and opened the door to welcome him inside.

Gao Changhe glanced at the bird and nodded. "Good. From now on, you won’t have to live in fear."

The bird puffed up its chest. "What nonsense! I was never afraid—"

Ignoring it, Gao Changhe turned to Li Zhengjing. "Chen Youyu, the former outer sect elder, was assassinated within the sect’s jurisdiction—a grave matter. Chen Yang clearly intended to pin this on you as the scapegoat. For the Law Enforcement Hall, this would have settled the case neatly, and the Chen Clan would have gained favor with Grand Elder Chen Zhu. Everyone would have been happy—except no one would have cared about the real culprit."

He sighed. "Given Grand Elder Chen Zhu’s involvement, I planned to use the token left by Lord Bai Xiao to secure your release. But I never expected the Law Enforcement Hall’s Chief to personally intervene. Consider yourself fortunate."

"The Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall?" Li Zhengjing frowned. He hadn’t known why he was acquitted, and this revelation puzzled him further.

"It likely has nothing to do with you," Gao Changhe said. "Perhaps the Chief acted out of respect for Yuan Zhengfeng’s past ties, or perhaps the Chen Clan’s interference in the Law Enforcement Hall had gone too far, provoking the Chief to suppress their arrogance."

Li Zhengjing remained silent. If those were the reasons, it didn’t matter much. But another possibility lingered in his mind—*the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord*.

So far, he knew the Chief of Gu Yue Peak was in league with the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord. Could the Law Enforcement Hall’s Chief, also subordinate to Gu Yue Peak, be connected to him as well? Was that why he intervened?

As Li Zhengjing pondered this, Gao Changhe continued. "You’ve escaped this time, but with no leads on the real culprit, the case must be closed. With Grand Elder Chen Zhu’s approval, Chen Youyu’s death has been ruled as *suicide*."

"Suicide?" Li Zhengjing gaped.

The bird couldn’t resist interjecting, "He was stabbed once in the front and *twelve times* in the back! How is that suicide?"

Gao Changhe narrowed his eyes. "How do you know the exact number of wounds?"

The bird shrank back, touching its green dragon horns. "Uh… I read it in the case files."

Gao Changhe studied it for a moment before turning back to Li Zhengjing. "Regardless, the case is closed. You needn’t worry anymore."

He paused, then added, "Also, for the next few days, avoid women, alcohol, and exhaustion. Rest well, bathe often, burn incense, and keep yourself pure."

"What’s this about?" Li Zhengjing asked, baffled.

"Is he getting married?" the bird chirped excitedly. "Then I’ll rest well too, bathe, burn incense—"

The tree muttered inwardly, *"Why isn’t it mentioning alcohol and women?"*

"It’s not confirmed yet," Gao Changhe said with a sigh. "The sect’s top true disciple, Lu Huaiyuan, discovered a skeleton while traveling near the ruins of Fengdu Mountain in the north. Its identity is still being verified."

After a moment of silence, he waved a hand. "But it’s most likely Yuan Zhengfeng’s remains."

Li Zhengjing’s heart clenched. That name was no stranger to him.

It was because of Yuan Zhengfeng that he had been admitted into the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.  
It was because of Yuan Zhengfeng that he had faced relentless suppression over the past six months.  
And it was because of Yuan Zhengfeng that he had been branded—marked as an enemy by those who had once clashed with the man.  

Grand Elder Chen Zhu was a prime example.  

"Though you entered the sect with Yuan Zhengfeng’s token, most inner sect elders paid you no mind—some didn’t even know you existed," Gao Changhe said. "But in just half a year, you’ve cultivated inner energy, slain a spirit beast, and captured a demonic cultivator at the upper inner energy realm. Your reputation is growing."  

"If these remains are indeed Yuan Zhengfeng’s, as his half-disciple, you’ll be tasked with welcoming them back to the sect for burial. This will put you in the spotlight before the sect’s highest elders."  

"Among them, some may favor you, but others will despise you because of Yuan Zhengfeng."  

Gao Changhe’s voice turned solemn. "I want you to present your best self before them. If those who favor you value you even more, they’ll ensure your safety."  

Li Zhengjing bowed. "Thank you for your guidance, Elder Gao."  

Gao Changhe’s eyes grew distant, lost in memories of the past. With a final sigh, he turned and left, his figure tinged with melancholy.  

"Old Gao!" the bird called after him. "Now that I look like this and no one recognizes me, what should I do?"  

"Before your grandfather entered the Thunder Prison to serve your punishment, he arranged a place for you. He’ll settle it when he returns. Until then, stay with Li Zhengjing."  

The bird shot Li Zhengjing a strange look.  

Back when it was stronger, it had looked down on this inner sect disciple from its lofty perch as the grandson of Lord Bai Xiao. Now, this reckless man had surpassed it in strength, stolen the Five Elements Creation Tree, and even served as a guardian for the Ghost Valley Spirit Official.  

Sticking with him felt like boarding a pirate ship—a one-way trip to disaster.  

"Don’t overthink it. You’re a wanted criminal too—none of us are clean," Li Zhengjing said flatly. "You’ve been calling me ‘Your Lordship’ just fine. If it feels awkward, I can beat you again until it rolls off your tongue like outside Great Liao City."  

"Your Lordship misunderstands! We’re partners in crime!" the bird squawked. "Out of the three of us—man, bird, and tree—only this tree is still innocent. Who knows when it might run off and rat us out? Let me discipline it!"  

The tree shrieked as chaos erupted once more.  

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing frowned. "Wait… I feel like I forgot something."  

After a moment, his eyes widened. "My dog! Where’s my big yellow dog?"  

He had brought the dog from the outer sect to guard his new residence, but he hadn’t taken it with him when he left the mountain. So where was it now?  

"Woof!"  

A bark sounded outside. Li Zhengjing opened the door to find the yellow dog lying there—and beside it stood a familiar figure.  

He Qingyu, an inner sect disciple of the Beast Taming Hall.  

"Junior Brother Li, your dog was starving and nearly got stewed while scavenging for food," she said softly. "Since you don’t seem to care for it much, why not let me train it? It’s quite clever—it might even become a spirit beast."  

Li Zhengjing hesitated. "That’s… not ideal. We’ve been through thick and thin together—like brothers, like limbs—"  

Before he could finish, even the dog rolled its eyes.
