# Chapter 183: Bro, Put the Hammer Away, I’m About to Pee

This sword strike truly "shattered" Yin Mianmian.

Her figure was like an illusion. Before the divine punishment of the sword light could strike her body, she dissipated first, leaving only a few tattered ribbons behind.

The Spring Wind Sword Intent, however, halted for a split second, allowing her to pass through.

**On the opposite rooftop.**

By the time she condensed her form again, she had completely changed her appearance.

The woman’s face was exquisitely alluring. Her hair danced in the wind, refracting a faint purple hue under the moonlight. Her attire was identical to the "Heavenly Maiden" Li Mo had seen earlier.

Her gaze swept over Ying Bing, then shifted to Li Mo. The anger in her eyes dissipated, replaced by a look of keen interest.

"Liu Wuyan, protecting her husband with such dominance?"

"Hehe, if I take your three swords, will you hand your husband over to me?"

Her voice was as soft as water, tugging at the heartstrings invisibly.

Sixth on the Qianlong List, Eight Apertures of the Divine Observation Realm!

Every genius on the Qianlong List possessed the strength to fight across realms.

After all, Bing Dangzi had just entered the Divine Observation Realm; she didn't necessarily stand a chance...

Li Mo glanced at Ying Bing’s flawless profile but ultimately kept his mouth shut.

How could she ever fear a challenge?

*Whoosh—*

Xia Huang Qi surged, carrying the少女 (young woman) onto the roof.

The clear moonlight washed over her, making her skin look like jade or porcelain. The divine rune on her forehead glimmered faintly, and her blue-flower skirt swayed slightly, adding a touch of earthly liveliness to her peerless, holy aura.

Under the moonlight.

Two peerless beauties, each with their own unique charm, stood in confrontation. Their auras were momentarily evenly matched.

This was also a clash of minds.

Yin Mianmian smiled sweetly, yet with a hint of grievance:

"Li Langjun, do you think I am beautiful?"

Li Mo: "..."

Do you know my Master too? Are you using the "Fighting King's Ultimate Move" too?

Are you testing cadres with this?

"You must have been malnourished as a child."

"Huh?"

Yin Mianmian froze. She had already pushed her Heart-Enchanting Technique to the limit. Not to mention a young boy like this, even a man of steel would turn into putty in her hands.

Just look at Zhong Zhenyue; he was so mesmerized he was practically drooling.

Why was Li Mo so decisive, without a shred of hesitation?

Li Mo’s eyes were clear, looking at her with pity as if looking at a pitiful worm:

"You’re so poorly developed, Auntie."

*Crack—*

A tile under Yin Mianmian’s foot shattered. Her tender, watery aura exposed a flaw. In that instant, she lost the upper hand in the battle of auras.

"Kill him..."

*Swish—*

Xia Huang Qi surged.

Tian Shuang seized the opportunity. It was clear and pure, overbearing and strict, striking directly at the flaw.

Bing Dangzi and Yin Mianmian began to exchange blows.

Li Mo looked up. On the rooftop, the phantom of a heavenly maiden and a sword intent resembling a deity competed in brilliance, making it hard to determine the winner for a moment.

Yin Mianmian seemed to be holding back?

This thought crossed his mind.

The Divine Intent of an Eight Apertures Divine Observation cultivator shouldn't be this weak; she could even fight against an Inner Scene expert.

Currently, Yin Mianmian’s Divine Intent fluctuation was only at the Three Apertures level.

Was she afraid of attracting the attention of strong experts from Sword City, or did she have another plan?

Surely this enchantress wasn't genuinely competing fairly with Bing Dangzi?

There was no time for further thought.

*Whoosh—*

A long spear stabbed at him from the side.

Zhong Zhenyue’s resolute face was filled with dullness, yet his eyes seemed furious, as if the goddess in his heart had been insulted.

In an instant, the spear was like a dragon, carrying killing intent, arriving before his eyes.

The Seven Kills Break Formation Spear, a high-grade supreme martial art. The King of the South once used this spear technique to kill a Level 4 disaster beast, the Xi Snake, and became famous throughout the Southern Frontier.

Now, executed by Zhong Zhenyue, it had reached the Perfection stage.

But it was not yet at the Transcendent level.

*Clang—*

A sound of metal colliding. The Sword Pill spewed sword light, turning from intangible to tangible. It wrapped around the Chixiao Sword and slammed ruthlessly into the flaw of the spear.

---

Zhong Zhenyue fell into a disadvantage.

However, relying on his bloodthirsty courage, he ignored the Chixiao Sword, aided by the Sword Pill, thrusting toward him and swung the spear shaft to smash Li Mo’s shoulder.

Little Li Mo frowned.

Yin Mianmian was likely doing this on purpose.

Even if he relied solely on the sword, Zhong Zhenyue couldn't do anything to him.

But that enchantress forced Zhong Zhenyue to fight with his life on the line. Her goal wasn't to capture Li Mo, but to hope Zhong Zhenyue died by Li Mo’s sword.

The King of the South was a Sixth Realm expert who commanded 300,000 elite troops in the Southern Frontier. Using military formations, he could fight against Xuanxuan experts.

"Wake him up."

"When facing a life-and-death crisis, one easily regains clarity."

Thus.

Li Mo’s Wind Shadow Steps flickered repeatedly, letting the spear smash the Meihua Pavilion’s architecture to pieces.

His mind sank into the World Seed; he wanted to take out a hammer.

*Emmmmm*

Wait.

Xingzi Chu was in the System Space.

He almost took out the Panjie Meteorite Hammer.

Well, it was just a tiny mistake. No big deal.

Xingzi Chu was in hand. The Sword Pill returned to the Dantian. Three Xuan Dan circled and rotated, and the sharp aura of the Soldier-Killing Qi seeped out of his body.

The divine runes on the Dantian child surged, making Zhong Zhenyue’s movements appear slow in Li Mo’s eyes.

Yin-Yang Qi wrapped around him. Xingzi Chu was raised.

"!"

In Zhong Zhenyue’s eyes, it seemed as if a mountain supporting the heavens was crushing down on him.

In that instant, he smelled the scent of death.

His eyes instantly cleared.

*Woo—*

Xingzi Chu stopped right at the tip of his nose. The intense Soldier-Killing sharpness made his skin tighten, and even his hairstyle was blown backward.

*Gulp—*

Zhong Zhenyue swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

"You awake?"

"Bro, please put the hammer away first. I... I can't hold my pee."

"......"

Li Mo’s mouth twitched. He put away the hammer and went to help Princess Jiang.

Yin Mianmian hadn't come alone. There were assassins in this Drizzle Tower; Jiang Chulong was blocking them.

More than a dozen Xuan Dan Realm experts and several Divine Observation Realm experts, yet not a single one could break through her sword perimeter.

When Li Mo joined the battle, everything became much simpler.

The少年 (young man) waved his sword while speaking angrily:

"Adaptation isn't random fabrication. Who taught you the 'Crooked Mouth'?"

"Go repent!"

"Crooked mouth? I'll knock your head crooked!"

...

Zhong Zhenyue watched the少年’s figure with a tingling scalp.

He wasn't joking, nor was he lacking backbone.

Just now, that terrifying hammer, carrying a surging karmic fire, came down just three and a third inches from his nose.

When he entered the Southern Frontier and faced hundreds of beasts, he had never felt such terror.

He really wasn't afraid of death.

But just now, he really almost peed his pants.

Zhong Zhenyue recalled how Li Mo had looked like a peerless sword immortal using the "Ten Thousand Swords Return to the Origin" during the day, and for a moment, he wondered if he was still dreaming.

You call this... a Sword Immortal?

The battle on the rooftop was also reaching a climax.

Yin Mianmian looked into the distance, as if sensing something, and turned her head to smile:

"Fairy Sister, next time we meet, I won't hold back."

The reply was another sword from Ying Bing.

But just like before, Yin Mianmian’s figure flickered and vanished from the spot.

Whether she had already achieved a certain goal, or her thoughts were too诡谲 (scheming) and unpredictable, or perhaps both.

In her voice, there was not a trace of frustration from defeat or retreat. Instead, it sounded as if she had seen the funniest joke in the world.

"Hahaha... Li, Sword, Immortal?"

"If you win the summit and become the Hengyun Sword Hero, that would be even more interesting~"

The voice gradually faded away.
