# Chapter 36: Transcending Malevolent Spirits, the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix Inheritance Ground

After an unknown amount of time, the intense sensation of weightlessness finally vanished, but there was still no solid ground beneath their feet; they hadn't landed on earth.

Li Mo finally regained consciousness. He suddenly found that behind them were clouds and mist shimmering with seven-colored light. It was thanks to this strange cloud-mist that they hadn't suffered even the slightest harm. And these radiant mists were flowing out from the crevices of a stone gate not far away.

“Thank you, you can let go now.” A cool, detached voice sounded by his ear.

“Uh....” Li Mo didn't react immediately. That perfectly beautiful face was very close to his, so much so that he could even feel her warm breath. Because he was holding her too tightly, he could even feel the ice block's heartbeat through their clothes.

It was well known that when people fall into water or from a great height, they subconsciously grasp onto anything they can. Young Student Li felt a bit awkward for a moment. He seemed to have worried needlessly and done something superfluous.

Li Mo lightly coughed, released her, and stood up, pretending to survey their surroundings: “Where is this? I've never heard of such a place beneath Qingyuan Abyss.”

“You asked me to come to Wangyue Cliff, was it to bring me here?”

“Mm.” Ying Bing nodded, not offering much explanation.

“How do you know about this place?” Li Mo asked casually. People tend to talk more when they're awkward.

Ying Bing lowered her gaze, stating calmly: “I've been here in a dream.” If one were to consider what happened in her previous life as a dream, then this statement wasn't wrong. After her rebirth, many things had changed. But fortunately, the call from this place to her had never faded.

Even if others had a hundred lives, jumping from Wangyue Cliff wouldn't allow them to reach this inheritance located within Qingyuan Abyss. Even if they arrived, they wouldn't be able to smoothly enter the inheritance itself, only to be trapped and die on the radiant mist.

“Let's go.” Ying Bing subconsciously reached for her waist, but found nothing.

“Use mine.” As his voice fell, in her palm appeared an utterly ordinary Qinggang sword, with a few rice-grain-sized nicks on it. It seemed his journey to Wangyue Cliff wasn't as easy as he claimed?

Ying Bing suppressed her thoughts, gave a slight nod, and advanced with her sword drawn. Li Mo followed beside her, wary of their surroundings. Since it was an inheritance, perhaps..... there was still some kind of trial?

No sooner had the thought crossed his mind, whoosh— A bone-chilling wind swept through, sending shivers deep into their souls.

“Come down.... stay with me......”

“Why are you still alive!”

“Opportunity...... Peerless opportunity...... Take me with you inside.....”

Layers of delirious whispers drifted on the wind.

“Be careful.”

“Don't stray too far from me.” Ying Bing's clear, cold voice reached him.

“What are these?” Li Mo, using the light from the radiant bridge, looked around. He saw dark, cloudy mist surging, with distorted, pained faces flickering in and out of sight.

In the past, Ying Bing would surely have been too lazy to explain. But today, she surprisingly enlightened him: “When a martial artist reaches the Observation Realm, they can observe mountains, rivers, sun, moon, strange flowers, rare herbs, various exotic beasts, and even natural wonders to temper their spirit. Upon grand completion of the Observation Realm, their spirit can even leave their body and control objects with their mind. Therefore, if a martial artist above the Observation Realm dies with lingering obsessions, an undying wisp of their spirit will transform into a malevolent spirit (yinwu). Malevolent spirits cannot be exposed to sunlight, which is why there are so many here.”

Young Student Li understood. It was obvious that many people must have harbored the thought of exploring Qingyuan Abyss and put it into practice. Among them were not a few powerful cultivators. Clearly, they had all failed. A wisp of their obsession remained here forever, guarding the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix inheritance that they could no longer enter.

“Malevolent spirits.....” The cold wind, carrying malevolent spirits, assailed them from all directions. Ying Bing, by his side, suddenly struck. Clang— This was the first time Li Mo had seen Ying Bing seriously make a move. The sword light surged, blooming into hundreds of sword flowers. Each sword energy flower precisely struck a malevolent spirit, forcefully repelling it.

Consummate Realm Flower-Seeking Sword Art!

However, this attack, powerful enough to make an Inner Breath realm cultivator retreat, surprisingly caused no significant damage to the malevolent spirits after striking them. It merely knocked them back into the cloudy mist, and they would soon return.

“Hurry, malevolent spirits are not afraid of physical weapons.......” Before Ying Bing could finish speaking, suddenly, a warm, peaceful sensation emanated from behind him. From Li Mo's chest, the satchel lit up with the shape of a feather—the Fire Sparrow Plume. Pure Yang and utterly righteous, it was precisely the bane of malevolent and yin-turbid entities.

Li Mo lightly threw a punch. On his fist, a thin layer of Fire Sparrow Yang Qi was surprisingly attached.

“Hehehe.....” The malevolent spirit opposite him clearly did not possess complete sentience. Thus, it didn't realize the gravity of the situation. Sizzle! It was as if ice and snow had met boiling oil. The malevolent spirit's ink-like, dense figure began to melt and disintegrate almost instantly. It instinctively tried to retreat, but Li Mo directly pierced it with a single punch. Poof— The malevolent spirit dispersed.

“In that satchel, there's a trace of Phoenix clan aura. It should be left by some kind of bird containing true phoenix bloodline?” Ying Bing's tense body relaxed slightly. This way, she wouldn't need to be distracted looking after him.

Only..... why was Li Mo still standing there, unmoving?

Young Student Li was somewhat stunned. Because just now, the system had surprisingly sent a notification.

**[Congratulations, Host, for a successful investment! You have helped 'Xia Rong' dispel her obsession and find peace.]**
**[Investment Feedback: One year of martial arts comprehension.]**

Li Mo: “!” Killing malevolent spirits could actually count as investment feedback? No wonder people say transcending spirits earns merit......

And so, Li Mo looked at the shadows churning in the mist, a hint of eagerness in his eyes. Even mosquito legs are meat. Rewards that are due must still be claimed.

Just as Li Mo was about to continue, he saw the ice block looking over with a slight frown.

“Ahem.” Li Mo cleared his throat. “Many of these malevolent spirits are predecessors of the Qingyuan Sect. Since it's a small effort, let's allow them to rest in peace.” Young Student Li said earnestly.

Ying Bing's lips were lightly pressed, a clear, ethereal flicker in her eyes. Ultimately, she didn't urge him on, quietly waiting beside him. Any malevolent spirits that rushed towards her, she would casually direct them towards Li Mo.

Awesome. Li Mo inwardly cheered with satisfaction. With a man and a woman working together, the effort is less tiring. In less than two incense sticks' time, the malevolent spirits were largely cleared out, and even the air didn't feel as chilling. What he received in return was a series of investment feedbacks. Roughly calculated, he gained eighty-six years of martial arts comprehension, bringing his total to almost two hundred years.

There were also various miscellaneous items: broken weapons, elixirs with different effects, gold and silver treasures, and even a few land deeds, though he didn't know if they were still valid.

“Many thanks.” Li Mo smiled from the heart, cupping his hands in a salute towards Ying Bing.

“Mm.” Ying Bing sheathed her sword, and a strange feeling inexplicably arose in her heart. Sometimes she couldn't understand why Li Mo would do such things that brought no benefit and wasted time. But the feeling after it was done... it didn't seem unpleasant?

Shaking her head, she took a few steps forward, finally standing before the moss-covered stone gate at the entrance of the inheritance ground. Her delicate hand pressed against the stone gate.

Buzz— A strange vibration emanated. Dust rustled down, and the stone gate slowly opened. Peach-colored light, like blooming flowers, flowed out, filling the surrounding space. The light suddenly brightened; Li Mo instinctively raised a hand to block it, peering through his fingers into the gate.
