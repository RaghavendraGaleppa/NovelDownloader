# Chapter 11: Ancient Immortal?

Crack!

Like glass developing fissures, the massive, irregular diamond-shaped Source Ancient Jade Wall began to show winding cracks radiating from the point of impact where the pickaxe struck.

With the passage of time, a continuous cracking sound came from the Source Ancient Jade Wall. The entire massive structure was now covered in a dense spiderweb of cracks.

Li Haomiao’s face was pale, his lips trembling slightly. The situation had exceeded his expectations; Xu Yunfan had managed to shatter the Source Ancient Jade Wall with just one swing of his pickaxe.

It was impossible!

If it weren't for his disabled legs, he would have jumped up in shock immediately.

Then, he reacted, his face turning deathly pale.

It seemed that the person inside the Source Ancient Jade Wall was breaking free, about to emerge.

"Shall we retreat for now?"

Li Haomiao turned around, only to find the space behind him empty. He looked up.

Xu Yunfan had already run to the corner of the mine tunnel, half of his body already swallowed by the shadows, on the verge of leaving.

Li Haomiao roared, "That's too treacherous! I taught you martial arts, and yet you act like such a scoundrel!"

Xu Yunfan, who had reached the tunnel entrance, paused at these words. He looked up and sighed, retracting the step he had taken. He had received a good education in the new era and couldn't quite shake the guilt in his heart.

He turned around, his toes gripping the ground for lift, and shot toward Li Haomiao like an arrow leaving a bow. In the blink of an eye, he was before Li Haomiao. He grabbed him and was about to turn and leave when.

The Source Ancient Jade Wall let out a 'crash' and completely shattered.

Xu Yunfan froze instantly, cursing, "You've killed us!"

Li Haomiao ignored Xu Yunfan, his eyes fixed intently on the shattered Source Ancient Jade Wall.

Under the illumination of the firelight, a graceful, naked body fell out from within the Source Ancient Jade Wall.

A strange, sudden draft flowed slowly through the mine tunnel. The flame on the torch flickered, causing the shadows to dance continuously, as if evil spirits were breaking free from their cages.

"Where is this wind coming from?"

Li Haomiao’s face was ashen, his voice trembling with a fear he didn't even realize himself.

In a mine tunnel hundreds of meters deep, air exchange only occurred in the main tunnels, flowing into the branch tunnels. It was impossible for such a piercing wind to arise in this branch tunnel.

After a long silence, the eerie draft vanished.

Xu Yunfan’s stiff body relaxed slightly. He guessed, "It was probably just the commotion caused by the Source Ancient Jade Wall shattering."

"That must be it, that must be it!"

Li Haomiao snapped back to reality, a hint of color returning to his face, and his trembling lips stilled.

Xu Yunfan came to his senses and moved closer to Li Haomiao. Looking at the motionless, jade-like graceful body not far away, the heart that had leaped to his throat slowly settled back down.

He had scared himself.

"You're afraid of ghosts?"

Hearing Xu Yunfan’s question, Li Haomiao’s expression tightened.

"The superior man does not speak of strange forces or spirits. In this environment, do not speak nonsense. I naturally do not believe in them. With the current timing and terrain unfavorable, and the celestial constellations not yet in position, the secret powers of the world are all dormant. It is impossible for ghosts to exist."

Xu Yunfan’s mouth twitched. He gestured with his chin toward the naked body.

"That one... should be the immortal you spoke of, who buried herself in the Source Ancient Jade Wall?"

Li Haomiao moistened his lips. He naturally understood Xu Yunfan’s implication: he wanted him to go check first.

"I am of the royal family of the Great Zhou, bearing the mandate of heaven. If not for unforeseen circumstances, I would have been the Emperor of the Great Zhou. My heart is tied to the rivers and mountains and concerned with the common people. How can you ask me to do such a thing?"

Xu Yunfan chuckled. "The Emperor and the commoner are of the same status. The heart of the people is what matters. Now that we are both prisoners, generally speaking, my survival value is greater. Your Highness, the Prince of Yan, you may rest in peace. If there is a chance, I will definitely speak to that Empress and seek justice for you."

Li Haomiao could no longer maintain his composure. "Brother Xu, I have a method. Why don't we go together?"

Xu Yunfan shook his head. "No, no. For all we know, that body is coated with all sorts of deadly poisons. Touch it and you die. There might even be colorless, odorless toxins spreading right now... Good heavens, I can already feel my breathing is getting a bit difficult. No, I have to leave this place first."

Seeing Xu Yunfan about to leave, Li Haomiao panicked and said, "I have a secret technique that can temper the muscles, skin, and bones, blending them into one, allowing you to surpass ordinary people. True Blood is excellent, but if your foundation is poor, you can never reach the pinnacle of martial arts no matter what."

Xu Yunfan stopped his steps and said politely, "Your Highness, the Prince of Yan, you are too kind. Rest assured, how could I be so treacherous? But since you, the Prince of Yan, have requested it, as a commoner of the Great Zhou, I naturally dare not refuse. I will surely overcome the difficulties and move forward bravely."

Li Haomiao sneered, "If all commoners were like you, the Great Zhou would have collapsed long ago."

Xu Yunfan didn't care about the sarcasm and asked, "What exactly is True Blood?"

Li Haomiao naturally knew that although Xu Yunfan, as a commoner, possessed True Blood, it was normal for him not to understand the situation. He frowned.

"I'll explain that later. Let's check on that one first."

Both men were cunning and sly. They had been pulling each other's legs just to see if the graceful body that fell from the Source Ancient Jade Wall had any movement.

Xu Yunfan walked to Li Haomiao's side and gently lifted him onto his back, saying politely, "Your Highness, let me carry you to the front."

If one didn't know better, they would think Xu Yunfan was loyal and devoted, seeking glory for his master.

Li Haomiao: "..."

Holding a torch in one hand and carrying Li Haomiao on his back with the other, Xu Yunfan approached the naked body. Only then did he discover with surprise that the figure that had fallen from the Source Ancient Jade Wall was a woman.

Hmm, although he could tell from the figure earlier, seeing her up close was a different feeling.

His expression was slightly dazed.

This was an incredibly beautiful woman. Her black hair was like silk, her eyebrows like spring mountains with a hint of dark green. Her eyes were tightly closed, her eyelashes thick, her nose straight and delicate, and her features exuded a sense of cold elegance.

Looking further down, her body was exquisitely shaped, her skin like congealed fat, her neck long and slender, extending to her fragrant shoulders and collarbones.

Her arms were stretched out loosely, her hands恰好 covering her chest, hiding her secrets without revealing anything. Her waist was slender, and her hips and legs had graceful curves.

For a long while, Xu Yunfan swallowed hard.

He swore that even after being desensitized by the internet beauties in short videos from his previous life, this woman made them all pale in comparison.

Li Haomiao couldn't help but feel a flash of awe in his eyes, followed by an involuntary sense of self-abasement, wanting to cover his face and retreat.

After a long time, Li Haomiao, who had suppressed his emotions, turned his head to look at Xu Yunfan, who was staring blankly at the woman.

"Have you never seen such a beautiful woman before?"

Xu Yunfan was somewhat distracted, his eyes unblinking.

"I was just thinking about how she fell in such a perfect pose, how her arms just happened to cover her private parts."

Li Haomiao: "..."

After a long time, and confirming that there was nothing abnormal, Xu Yunfan squatted down, carefully observing the woman who seemed to be in a deep sleep. If it weren't for the fact that her chest wasn't moving, he would have really thought she was just asleep.

He turned his head and asked Li Haomiao.

"Can you see anything?"

Li Haomiao's gaze was complex, filled with shock.
