# Chapter 90: Sea Beast  

After practicing the "Diamond Protection Divine Skill," Li Shiming proceeded to cultivate the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique" above the spirit-gathering plate near the spiritual spring.  

Once he finished the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique," it was time to rest—though this so-called rest was actually spent studying scientific knowledge through the IBMz15.  

Back when he worked in the library, he read books purely out of personal interest. Now, however, he focused more on energy, medicine, botany, and mechanical engineering. He sought to use his knowledge from his past life to interpret spiritual power, spells, and cultivation techniques, enabling the IBMz15 to analyze and decode the cultivation methods and spiritual energy of this world.  

He knew this task wouldn’t be easy. Although this world lacked the technological advancements of his previous life, cultivators here had developed a sophisticated system entirely reliant on spiritual energy.  

At midnight, he resisted the rebellious impulses emanating from his bronze corpse.  

Afterward, he engaged in sparring sessions with the bronze corpse in the underground chamber. During these sessions, he practiced the "Sword Control Technique" he had learned during the day, using the bronze corpse as his target.  

The bronze corpse could dodge or block but was forbidden from attacking him.  

Even though the Flaming Sword had acknowledged him as its master, and even though the "Sword Control Technique" was hailed as the most formidable sword-based offensive method in the Qi Refinement stage, Li Shiming himself was still too weak. His mastery of the technique was rudimentary, and the Flaming Sword's grade was too low.  

Even if the Flaming Sword struck the bronze corpse, it wouldn’t leave so much as a scratch.  

Yet it was precisely this kind of practice that allowed Li Shiming to rapidly improve his proficiency with the "Sword Control Technique."  

When he grew tired, he switched to practicing controlling the bronze corpse.  

His daily cultivation routine ended at the hour of Yin (3-5 AM). Afterward, he slept for two hours in his cave abode before dawn arrived.  

His cultivation level was still too low, and to maintain optimal training results, he needed sleep to recover.  

This was Li Shiming’s daily routine. Ever since arriving at Eagle Beak Island, his days had been packed with such activities.  

Two months passed in this manner, and he was no longer the rookie who could only rely on talismans, explosives, and quick wits to protect himself.  

He had developed his own combat methods. Even without revealing the bronze corpse, his "Sword Control Technique" had significantly enhanced his fighting prowess.  

Within a thirty-meter range, the Flaming Sword obeyed his commands as effortlessly as his own limbs—this was the maximum control range for a third-level Qi Refinement cultivator using the "Sword Control Technique."  

This morning, Li Shiming had a slightly easier time since he didn’t need to cast the "Spring Rain Transformation Technique" on the spirit fields.  

After two months, the spirit rice in the fields had finally ripened.  

Moreover, checking the calendar, this was the last harvest of the year. After this, the spirit fields would no longer be suitable for growing spirit rice.  

Of course, if he wished, he could plant other suitable spiritual crops during the six-month period when spirit rice couldn’t be cultivated.  

The experience of countless generations had shown that Heavenly Sea Sect’s spirit fields could only sustain spirit rice for six months each year.  

Li Shiming had no intention of trying to break this rule. He didn’t want to appear too unconventional.  

At least until he had sufficient strength to protect himself within the sect, he dared not reveal too many of his abilities.  

Currently, within his server room space, he was conducting research on spirit rice.  

Through genetic modification, he sought to solve the issue of low yields. The research was still in its early stages, primarily focused on increasing production in ordinary spirit fields.  

The five acres of spirit fields before him had demanded considerable effort, yet the yield only amounted to 160 catties. After handing over 50 catties to the sect, he was left with 110 catties per acre.  

On the surface, this seemed like a decent harvest. However, one had to consider that the spirit rice seeds he used had been meticulously selected from multiple generations grown in his server room space, and the seedlings had also been cultivated there.  

Had the same seedlings been grown entirely in the server room space, a single acre could yield over 600 catties, with the growth period halved.  

Many factors affected the growth of spirit rice: spirit insects, fluctuating weather, sunlight, the adaptability of the seedlings themselves, and more.  

These were all subjects of his research. Fortunately, his consciousness in the server room space could operate at a micrometer level, making the most tedious part of the research the growth cycle of the rice itself. Even in the server room space, it would take months to produce results through multiple generations.  

The mature spirit rice emitted a faint fragrance, bringing a smile to Li Shiming’s face. Regardless of the yield, this was the first batch of spirit rice he had painstakingly cultivated in the fields.  

The rice still needed another hour or two to reach peak ripeness, so he had to wait a little longer.  

Just as he waited, he felt a warning pulse from his identity jade slip—something was attacking the island’s defensive formation.  

The defensive formation protected Eagle Beak Island, and in the two months since his arrival, this was the first time anything had assaulted it.  

Powered by the subpar spirit vein, the formation could withstand at most a quarter-hour of sustained attacks from a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator before collapsing.  

Still, that was enough time for him to send a distress signal through his identity jade slip.  

Checking the intensity of the attack through the jade slip, he sensed that the creature was only at the third level of Qi Refinement.  

Li Shiming took out his paper crane, leaped onto its back, and flew toward the site of the attack.  

Outside the defensive formation, a monster the size of a small calf was repeatedly ramming against the barrier.  

With each collision, its skin rippled, revealing thick layers of fat beneath.  

Li Shiming had no idea what this creature was. He realized how lacking his knowledge was—he needed to exchange information with other sect disciples to acquire essential knowledge. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even recognize the creatures he encountered.  

"Slash!" Whether he recognized it or not didn’t matter—his attack proceeded regardless.  

Pointing his finger at the monster, a streak of sword light shot forth.  

Despite its bloated appearance, the monster was surprisingly agile. Spotting the sword light, it rolled aside to evade.  

But the sword light of the "Sword Control Technique" wasn’t limited to straight trajectories. With a flick of Li Shiming’s finger, the light curved midair and continued its pursuit.  

This time, the distance was too close. The monster spat out a mouthful of seawater, forming a watery shield in front of itself.  

Rather than clashing head-on, the sword light skirted around the shield and slashed at the monster’s lower body.  

The monster tried to adjust the shield, but it couldn’t match the sword light’s speed.  

A strange howl erupted from the monster as the Flaming Sword left a wound on its body.  

The sword’s fire attribute happened to counter the monster. Red blood gushed from the wound, instantly vaporized by the intense heat.  

Li Shiming’s spiritual power had long since shifted from fire to metal attributes, so this was purely the Flaming Sword’s innate fire nature. Even so, it inflicted significant damage.  

The wounded monster attempted to flee, but the sword light, now in close quarters, gave no quarter—it pierced straight through the monster’s skull.
