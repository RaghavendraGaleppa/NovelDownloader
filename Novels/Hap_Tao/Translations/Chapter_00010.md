# Chapter 10: The Unexpected

The Cold Iron Palm technique used palm strikes in place of saber attacks, emphasizing swiftness and ferocity. It consisted of five fundamental stances without overly complex variations: Mountain Splitting Stance, Mountain Crumbling Stance, Mountain Lifting Stance, Piercing Thrust Stance, and Whipping Hammer Stance. These five stances formed the basis for all practical combat techniques.

For instance, the Mountain Splitting Stance included variations like vertical splits, horizontal splits, diagonal splits, leaping splits, turning splits, and grazing splits—all adaptable for real combat.

Nangong Yue let out a cold "heh" and strode forward boldly, raising his palm like a blade to deliver a powerful Mountain Splitting strike. As his calloused fingers came together, a faint red glow emanated from his palm, resembling heated iron, and the gust from his strike carried a wave of scorching air. This was the manifestation of a Skin Membrane Realm martial disciple channeling their blood energy through muscles and tendons, creating surging power beneath the skin.

Seeing Nangong Yue's palm strike come down with overwhelming force and momentum, Qin Ziling didn't panic as he usually would. Instead, his mind entered a state of serene clarity, like a still pond. This mental state allowed his consciousness to act as a mirror, reflecting every minute detail of his surroundings and even faintly predicting his opponent's movements through shifts in air currents and energy fluctuations.

Without hesitation, Qin Ziling swiftly sidestepped, narrowly avoiding Nangong Yue's fierce strike. Simultaneously, he raised his knee sharply to intercept Nangong Yue's concealed left palm strike, preventing it from gaining momentum. His right palm shot forward in a Mountain Crumbling Stance, slamming toward Nangong Yue's extended right arm, while his left hand formed a knife-hand thrust aimed at the ribs.

Nangong Yue had expected Qin Ziling to either retreat in panic—allowing him to press forward with successive strikes—or block with his arms, leading to a direct clash where his superior strength would crush Qin Ziling's defenses. If Qin Ziling tried to dodge sideways, Nangong Yue's hidden palm strike would counter with a Mountain Crushing blow to knock him down.

But to his shock, Qin Ziling's sidestep was executed with flawless precision, evading his strike by a hair's breadth. Not only that, Qin Ziling's knee blocked his hidden attack, sealing off his follow-up completely.

"Damn it!" Nangong Yue, being a Skin Membrane Realm disciple, reacted swiftly. He used his concealed right palm to slap Qin Ziling's incoming knee, propelling himself backward like a startled cat and narrowly avoiding the knife-hand thrust to his ribs.

Qin Ziling inwardly sighed in disappointment. His foundational strength was mediocre, so while his palm strikes lacked power, a concentrated thrust—like a knife stab—could deal significant damage. Had that strike landed, Nangong Yue would have been in pain for days, possibly ending the fight prematurely.

However, aside from Qin Ziling's heightened reflexes, Nangong Yue's true combat prowess far surpassed his. Not only had Nangong Yue dodged the counter, but his hasty palm strike to Qin Ziling's knee still left a dull ache, as if he had struck stone.

"Huh?" The other disciples, who had been practicing their forms, paused in surprise. Even Zuo Le, who had been sipping tea under the shade of a tree, set down his cup.

Nangong Yue had challenged Qin Ziling multiple times before, each encounter ending in a one-sided beating. The others had long grown accustomed to it and paid little attention. As for Zuo Le, such sparring was child's play—hardly worth his notice.

Of course, Zuo Le knew Nangong Yue was deliberately provoking Qin Ziling, but he didn't intervene. In his eyes, Qin Ziling had been too proud in the past, refusing to acknowledge his lower status. He never begged for mercy during these beatings and had even been caught stealing glances at Luo Yukē, clearly still harboring feelings. Zuo Le, having lived through life's harsh realities, believed these humiliations might teach Qin Ziling to stay humble—a lesson that could save his life someday. Besides, sparring with Nangong Yue, however one-sided, still improved Qin Ziling's combat skills.

Still, if Nangong Yue went too far, Zuo Le would step in. For now, it was just youthful rivalry—nothing worth interfering over.

But this time, Qin Ziling hadn't been overwhelmed. Instead, he had countered so effectively that Nangong Yue had to leap back. That was unexpected.

Feeling the eyes of the crowd on him, Nangong Yue's face flushed with anger. With a furious roar, he charged forward again, his palm strikes just as aggressive and relentless as before. He refused to believe Qin Ziling's earlier move was anything more than a fluke.

Qin Ziling remained calm, sidestepping once more and seizing opportunities to counter. Nangong Yue, now baffled and enraged, found himself forced to retreat again.

"Seems you've improved since we last sparred," Nangong Yue sneered, his gaze icy. He began circling Qin Ziling cautiously, his palm strikes shifting unpredictably like a coiled serpent ready to strike. His earlier arrogance had vanished.

In contrast, Qin Ziling stood unmoving, exuding the composed confidence of a seasoned fighter. The onlookers exchanged surprised glances.

"Interesting," Zuo Le murmured, now genuinely intrigued.

As the spectators watched in astonishment, Nangong Yue launched another assault—this time with no trace of carelessness. His strikes were now fluid and varied, abandoning his earlier brute-force approach for intricate footwork and rapid transitions. This was the true display of his talent as a Skin Membrane Realm martial disciple.

Qin Ziling dodged continuously, his expression growing serious. "His variations are too fast and numerous. My body's reflexes can't keep up with my mind's predictions. But even a Skin Membrane Realm disciple can't sustain this relentless assault forever. I'll wait for his stamina to wane—then strike back."

Seeing Qin Ziling on the defensive, Nangong Yue's confidence surged. A vicious grin spread across his face as he pressed harder, convinced victory was within reach.
