# Chapter 49: Twelve Strikes of the Calming Storm, Ying Bing's Frightening Progress

“Last time, the investment in Brother Murong was a six-pattern Clear Heart Pill, its value comparable to a top-tier martial art.”

“But this time, the reward is an Ancient Bronze Heavenly Book Seal.”

“A permanent solution is better than a temporary fix, isn't it?”

Li Mo thoughtfully stroked the small copper seal in his palm.

He continued searching on the fifth floor.

Top-tier martial arts were already rare here, and those involving hammers were even scarcer.

Yet, after half an hour, he actually found something.

“‘Twelve Strikes of the Calming Storm.’”

Li Mo brushed away the thick dust from the book and read its title clearly.

A top-tier martial art, and a short-hammer technique.

It consisted of twelve forms. Upon reaching Great Perfection, a single strike could shake the earth and move mountains.

Hmm...

If I were to reach the Realm of Transcendence and had sufficient cultivation, could I rival my Master’s punch?

Li Mo looked at the missing chunk of the Divine Weapon Peak and pondered silently.

He continued flipping through the pages.

Then he discovered...

“This martial art is only two-thirds complete?”

It stopped abruptly at the eighth form.

Little Li fell into deep thought.

After a moment, he still picked up the manual and headed downstairs.

Mainly because he currently had no other choice.

He could only take it back first and figure something out later.

On the first floor.

It was still that Inner Sect Elder.

“Junior Brother Li, have you made your choice?”

“Yes,麻烦 Senior Brother to record it for me.”

Li Mo handed the book over.

“Uh... Hm?”

The Inner Sect Elder took the book. Just as he picked up his brush to record it, he froze upon seeing the name of the martial art:

“Junior Brother Li, this is a hammer technique.”

He seriously glanced at the long sword at Li Mo’s waist.

It was already common knowledge within the sect that this Junior Brother Li, a true disciple, had obtained the Crimson Dawn, a sword as famous as the Skyfrost Sword, within the Divine Blade Cave.

Therefore, including him, many people believed that even if he wasn't as good as Junior Sister Ying Bing, he was definitely a ‘Sword Genius’ within their common sense.

After all, Ying Bing was terrifying. With a wave of her hand, named swords flew to her, queuing up to acknowledge her as their master. That was beyond the scope of their cognition.

Instead, Junior Brother Li, who accepted the test of the Crimson Dawn Sword through his swordsmanship, was the image of a genius they could imagine.

A sword genius, picking a hammer technique?

“I haven’t made a mistake.”

“Other mountains’ stones can polish this jade. I already have my sword techniques. Looking at other martial arts might help me gain insight through analogy.”

Li Mo shook his head.

Other mountains’ stones can polish this jade?

This polishing is a bit too far-fetched...

“This martial art is incomplete, yet it still consumes one opportunity. Junior Brother Li, please think it through,” the Inner Sect Elder reminded him.

“Hmm, I’ve already seen it.”

“Very well. Please return the martial art within a month. Remember, do not spread it outside.”

Seeing that Li Mo had not changed his mind, the Inner Sect Elder said no more.

...

At the same time.

On the main peak of Qingyuan, in the Sword Practice Ground.

Ying Bing crossed the threshold with her sword in her arms. Her plain-colored dress was as cool and detached as the sword she held.

As soon as she entered the Sword Practice Ground, several gazes, as if looking at a rare treasure, fell upon her.

“The Skyfrost Sword has found its master again after more than four hundred years. It is truly a match made in heaven,” Qian Bufan remarked with admiration.

Xue Jing, who seemed to have just returned from outside the mountain, looked weary but wore an indelible smile.

“The last time a玄器 (Mysterious Artifact) acknowledged a master in the sect was fifty years ago. This time, two Mysterious Artifacts have acknowledged masters simultaneously, and they are the Skyfrost and Crimson Dawn swords.”

“Rare, truly rare.”

“Yes,寒鶴 (Cold Crane), don’t look so grim. The Mysterious Artifacts are kept in the Divine Blade Cave to be used by people. Moreover, fine swords suit heroes. They have both found worthy owners.”

Elder Cold Crane had been silent since entering the Sword Practice Ground.

Everyone thought he was conflicted because he was reluctant to part with the Mysterious Artifacts.

“You’ve praised them enough. I’m not good with words, and I’m too lazy to say any more pleasant things,” Cold Crane said, giving Xue Jing an annoyed look.

My Divine Weapon Peak’s ‘Divine Weapon’ has been completely taken away!

“Alright, let’s give this old bunch a good look.”

“Just what kind of stunningly brilliant figure could make Mysterious Artifacts flock to them so eagerly?” Shangguan Wencang said in a gentle voice.

“Alright.”

Ying Bing nodded.

A sword light suddenly illuminated the entire hall.

A wind, from who knows where, blew down the pear blossoms surrounding the Sword Practice Ground.

Everyone couldn't help but squint their eyes.

Because as the sword danced, the petals seemed to move on their own, without any wind.

Sometimes they scattered, sometimes they gathered.

---

When scattered, they were breathtakingly beautiful, yet hidden with lethal intent.

When gathered, the chilling aura was terrifying, domineering and unmatched.

*Snap—*

Suddenly, every single petal exploded into ice shards.

“There is already a trace of Sword Intent.”

“Indeed. I’m afraid even the creator of the Seeking Blossom Sword Technique would be left far behind if they were to execute it themselves.”

“I barely recognize this sword technique. The one who is strong is not the technique, but her.”

...

The elders exchanged glances, as if waking from a dream.

They finally understood why the Skyfrost Sword had been so eager to acknowledge her as its master.

Intent.

This is not something that can be领悟 (comprehended) from a top-tier martial art.

Let alone the Blood Qi Realm, even in the Divine Observation Realm, those who can glimpse its subtleties are extremely rare.

This means that she, in the Blood Qi Realm, already possesses a martial arts foundation stronger than that of the Divine Observation Realm.

Is this a true genius?

The elders were lost for words.

Ying Bing sheathed her sword and stood quietly.

“Xiao Bing’er, was Li Mo’s swordsmanship guided by you?” Xue Jing asked after slowly recovering.

“Yes,” Ying Bing nodded.

“So that’s how it is.”

“Also, even with some swordsmanship talent, it would be extremely difficult to pass the Mysterious Artifact’s test at this time.”

“This shows that Li Mo is still a promising talent in the way of the sword.”

The elders looked as if they had figured it all out.

Only Elder Cold Crane had a complex expression and let out a sigh.

“In the way of the sword, even if I consider myself well-read and have read through all the historical texts, I’m afraid it would be hard to find anyone whose sword talent rivals yours,” Shangguan Wencang, the usually strict sect master of Qingyuan, couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

“There is one,” Ying Bing answered without hesitation.

“Oh?”

“There is always a higher mountain,” Ying Bing said softly.

The sword is the weapon she is most adept with, but it is not her greatest strength.

Moreover, the real sword prodigy...

The name that was truly worthy flashed through her mind again.

“Xiao Bing’er, how many meridians have you opened now? Has the chilling qi within your bloodline changed recently?” Xue Jing suddenly asked.

“Twelve meridians.”

“The chilling qi... has not changed.”

Twelve meridians?!

Xue Jing’s teacup silently slipped from his hand, soaking his pants.

In the vast Sword Practice Ground, a pin drop could be heard.

Then Ying Bing’s补充 (supplementary) voice rang out:

“Almost at the thirteenth.”

The elders were already petrified.

Hearing this, their petrified bodies almost shattered into pieces.

They were not only astonished by Ying Bing’s terrifyingly逆天 (heaven-defying) progress.

It is well known that a warrior in the Blood Qi Realm can open at most twelve main meridians.

What did she just say?

Thirteen meridians?

Doesn’t this mean that Ying Bing’s upper limit in the Blood Qi Realm is even more terrifying?

“Xiao Bing’er, how many main meridians do you feel you can open at most?”

“Twenty-four,” Ying Bing said calmly.

Even with some mental preparation, the sound of people gasping in shock echoed through the Sword Practice Ground.

They knew that all the so-called gifted talents were nothing compared to this.

...

At the same time.

Not far from the Autumn Water Pavilion, in front of a waterfall.

“Haa...”

Li Mo stopped his training.

In his senses, his meridians, strengthened by the Divine Weapon Slaughter Body, were like coiled pythons. Planted within them were seeds of blood qi, like lotus seeds, each surging with immense power.

“This training session, I actually opened two meridians at once.”

Li Mo exhaled a mouthful of turbid air.

He could feel that his body, which had been overdrawn from forcibly lifting the Panjie Meteorite Hammer last time, had completely recovered.

It even had the meaning of being reborn after being broken.

Plus, that divine weapon had the miraculous effect of tempering the body.

That was why he was able to make such a leap in progress.

“I can’t let my guard down.”

“My Blood Qi Realm hasn’t even reached the halfway point yet.”

Little Li was happy for a while, but he remained vigilant against arrogance and impatience.

Then, he took out the book, “Twelve Strikes of the Calming Storm,” from his chest.
