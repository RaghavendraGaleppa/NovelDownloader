# Chapter 123: Qi-Devouring Worms

"Senior Cultivator, spare my life! It's me, it's me!"

When Qin Tianhe brought Guangming before Lu Yang for the second time, before Qin Tianhe could even speak, Guangming eagerly cried out, "I am still useful, Senior Cultivator!"

"There are still a dozen or so Buddhist cultivators left behind in the Pure Land. This humble monk can deal with them. Besides that, there's also the Daoist Court. This humble monk can help you against the Daoist Court..."

Guangming was terrified that Lu Yang might have gone berserk and would casually chop him down. His words tumbled out, faster than his usual chanting speed, as he desperately tried to prove his worth. However, Lu Yang ignored him, instead glancing at him with a hint of impatience: "Shut up."

Before Lu Yang's voice faded, Guangming abruptly clamped his mouth shut. Not only did he stop talking, he even held his breath, fearing to provoke this great demon.

On the other side, Lu Yang gazed into the distance.

Almost simultaneously, Jiaolong Daoist among the True Inheritors also seemed to sense something, raising his distorted dragon head, his massive dragon eyes looking directly at the ground.

"Something's coming..."

At these words, the other True Inheritors immediately grew vigilant. The next second, the ground cracked open, and a creature with distinct carapaced armor slowly crawled out.

It was a demon insect.

Its size was roughly human, its entire body as black as if splashed with ink. Its mouthparts were sharp, and its myriad compound eyes gleamed with a cold, chilling light.

"What is this... a demon?"

Several Holy Sect True Inheritors showed curiosity. Chong Ming's first reaction was to consider the demon insect's bloodline and its potential for alchemy and medicine.

Xu Xin carefully observed the demon insect, assessing its strength.

Jiaolong Daoist, meanwhile, pondered if the demon insect's sharp mouthparts could be grafted onto his own body, and if so, where they would be most suitable.

As for Bi Feiyuan, her line of thought was rather peculiar. She deliberately struck a seductive pose towards the demon insect, then observed the changes in her own divine abilities, seemingly wanting to see if it would react to her. She even grew quite excited, as if wanting to draw its portrait.

The other Holy Sect disciples, meanwhile, pointed and whispered about the demon insect.

Facing the hubbub of discussion, the black demon insect tilted its head, then opened its mouthparts, slowly uttering a sound.

Initially, the sound was chaotic.

However, it quickly became clear and low: "Outsiders... Get out! Mother, this world does not welcome you!"

At these words, the overlapping chatter instantly ceased.

All the Holy Sect disciples, including the five True Inheritors, fell silent almost simultaneously. Nearly a hundred pairs of eyes turned in unison, fixing on the black demon insect.

In the vast wilderness, silence reigned, a bizarre stillness that made the speaking black demon insect squirm uncomfortably, instinctively retreating a few steps.

The next second, Xu Xin smiled:

"I thought it was a spirit pet of some beast-taming cultivator from the Daoist Court. Turns out I was mistaken... It's a native of this realm. What a waste of breath just now."

"Don't waste time."

On the other side, Jiaolong Daoist also showed an impatient expression: "Quickly dissect it and see what special abilities this native possesses."

Bi Feiyuan licked her red lips: "No need for such trouble; I'll know once I'm done with it."

Only Chong Ming wore an expression that declared, 'I am a normal person, disdainful of associating with other Holy Sect disciples,' and disdainfully moved away from the demon insect.

Seeing itself as a piece of meat on a chopping block in the eyes of its enemies, ready to be butchered at any moment, the black demon insect's voice filled with anger. It was about to speak again, but at that moment, Lu Yang, who had remained silent all along, suddenly shifted his gaze towards it.

"Hiss!?"

The next second, the once aggressive black demon insect seemed to have seen something incredibly terrifying. After a sharp shriek, it violently exploded!

However, the demon insect did not die, but transformed into a cloud of red mist.

As the red mist surged and churned, a piercing buzzing sound roared forth. Upon closer inspection, the crowd realized it was thousands of demon insects, each no larger than a grain of rice!

Immediately after, the demon insects swarmed forward!

Almost instinctively, Jiaolong Daoist raised his dragon head and spewed a stream of demonic flame from his mouth, engulfing dozens of demon insects, intending to burn them to ashes.

However, Jiaolong Daoist quickly frowned.

"Something's not right..."

Before his words faded, the demonic flame seemed to be devoured, rapidly dimming and extinguishing. Then, the demon insects swarmed out, their numbers several times greater than before!

In an instant, the other True Inheritors and even the Holy Sect disciples also took action, either unleashing divine abilities or throwing out magic treasures. However, to their surprise, although these attacks killed some demon insects, after devouring the attacks, the demon insects regenerated into even greater numbers!

In a flash, the demon insects had advanced all the way to Lu Yang's front.

"...Interesting."

Seeing this, Lu Yang raised an eyebrow. With a sweep of his gaze, in an instant, all the demon insects that had been so fearsome lost their vitality.

They cascaded down like falling rain.

Lu Yang casually picked one up, gently rubbed it between his fingers, and examined it: "This insect... it actually possesses a divine authority? No, it doesn't seem to have cultivated it itself."

The next second, Lu Yang looked up at the sky again. Perhaps because Grandmaster Ting You had improved the [Hall of Yama], allowing the Guardian Goddess Sunü to recover to her peak state with the power of the Buddhist cultivators within the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner, under her blessing, Lu Yang acutely sensed a strong malice.

This malice did not stem from others, but from this very world itself.

Flowers, birds, fish, insects, and even the spiritual energy within this world, all harbored intense malice towards him and the surrounding Holy Sect disciples.

However, currently, this malice was suppressed by three even more powerful forces.

Otherwise, these "outsiders" would not even be able to refine spiritual energy in this world. Rashly inhaling spiritual energy might even poison them.

"True Monarchs..."

Undoubtedly, the culprits who forced this world, despite its intense dislike, to passively allow outsiders to enter and exit freely, were the three Golden Core True Monarchs.

But even so, this world still had some power to resist.

The result was the divine authority now bestowed upon the demon insect. This was only a part of it; the true Child of Destiny should be the king of these demon insects.

"Are these... Qi-Devouring Worms?"

Just then, Grandmaster Ting You's voice suddenly rang out: "I thought these insects had long been extinct. I didn't expect to see them again today."

Lu Yang said, surprised, "Grandmaster, you recognize them?"

"Of course."

Grandmaster Ting You's tone carried a hint of reproach: "As a later-generation inheritor of my Witch Ghost Dao, have you not read the inherited Daoist scriptures?"

"Qi-Devouring Worms, as the name suggests, devour the Qi of heaven and earth. They are an ancient exotic species from outside this world, once landing overseas. They were obtained by a Great Daoist Master in the late Foundation Establishment realm from overseas, who cultivated them and ultimately refined 1.29 billion of these demon insects. When their Qi stirs, they blot out the sky and cover the sun; no Foundation Establishment cultivator could contend against them!"

"At that time, that Great Daoist Master from overseas caused quite a commotion."

"With 1.29 billion Qi-Devouring Worms, he even refined a formation diagram to complement them, declaring his intention to defy the heavens and challenge a True Monarch as a Foundation Establishment cultivator..."

At this point, Grandmaster Ting You couldn't help but show admiration: "I have to admit, overseas is barren, and their cultivators are truly ignorant."

Lu Yang's curiosity was piqued: "And then? Did he really go?"

"He did."

Grandmaster Ting You shook her head: "He went to Jiangxi, and then a Bodhisattva from the Pure Land found his sea of bugs noisy and killed him, bugs and all, with a single palm strike."

There was no suspense.

Even so, Lu Yang still understood the terror of these Qi-Devouring Worms.

Although they were killed by a True Monarch's palm, it implied that it *required* a True Monarch to kill them, which in itself proved their formidable nature.
