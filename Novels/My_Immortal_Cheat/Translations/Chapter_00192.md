# Chapter 192: New Skill

His body still radiated light. Although the upgrade was complete, the Undying System continued to absorb World Origin.

The character level display at the very top had changed:

**Level 6: 0/64**
**Deaths: 38**
**Revivals: 2/2**

His level had directly increased by one, and the number of deaths required for the next upgrade became 64. Although his daily revival count had increased to two, it would still take over a month to reach the next upgrade at this rate.

Since this was a direct host level increase, his death count did not increment. A new line appeared showing daily revival consumption. Because he had just undergone an upgrade, his revival count was also reset.

After this system upgrade, Zhou Tian had an idea: system upgrades were the primary way to increase his host level. Not only did they directly boost his level by one, but they also added an extra revival count. Currently, many powerful skills in the Undying System required revival counts as a prerequisite, with death counts serving mostly as a supplementary enhancement. However, he didn't know much about World Origin yet, nor what kind of World Origin would meet the system's upgrade requirements.

A golden, flickering skill appeared in the skill bar. Zhou Tian eagerly opened it. Just as before, three new shimmering skills appeared. He looked on with anticipation:

**[Judgmental Strike: Summons a bolt of lightning to strike a chosen enemy, causing up to five seconds of paralysis. Cannot be used repeatedly on the same target. Effect scales with enemy strength (Daily Uses: 37, related to Death Count)]**

Zhou Tian had seen this skill before; it appeared during his first upgrade, but at that time, he chose the more practical [Teleportation]. Now, it seemed quite powerful, especially since Zhou Tian now possessed cultivation and was no longer a mortal. In combat, he could combine many more skills. Many previously useless skills now had a purpose. For instance, [Blaze Burst] used to be a pure 'chicken rib' – completely ineffective at hitting anyone. But now, with his Law Manifestation Realm cultivation, he could release it at close range when fighting opponents of similar strength, and even combine it with other attacks. Thirty-odd fireballs would surely make anyone cough up some blood. This [Judgmental Strike] could also be combined, but its inability to be used repeatedly on the same target was a drawback, and its effect depended on the target's strength. He clearly remembered that the [Holy Word] skill had only paralyzed a Dao Master-level expert for a mere instant. Even if it could produce an effect regardless of strength, the degree of that effect was still debatable.

Brushing these thoughts aside, Zhou Tian looked at the next skill.

**[Attack Amplification: Increases the power of your next attack by 38% (related to Death Count). Daily Uses: 2 (related to Revival Count)]**

This skill made Zhou Tian's eyes light up. An amplification skill! A very strong skill, which would reach an incredible level as the death count accumulated. But this wasn't its most powerful aspect. Its strongest point lay in its description: "next attack." This description held much greater significance. Zhou Tian currently relied heavily on the [Cultivation Replication] skill. While it was indeed powerful, it could at most achieve an even match, a fifty-fifty split. Even with the final, insidious self-detonation move, it wasn't guaranteed to kill the opponent. Moreover, when using [Cultivation Replication], other system skills couldn't be cast simultaneously, leaving him without a decisive, one-hit kill option.

But with [Attack Amplification], everything changed. He could completely cast [Attack Amplification] first, then use [Cultivation Replication], and then unleash an overwhelmingly powerful strike. Since [Attack Amplification] was used *before* [Cultivation Replication], there was no conflict. Zhou Tian now had cultivation and could practice divine abilities. When using [Cultivation Replication], he could fully unleash his own cultivated divine abilities, then combine them with [Attack Amplification] to unleash an extremely powerful strike. The thought made him a little excited.

He swallowed. Although excited about his imagined skill combination, he didn't choose immediately. There was still one skill he hadn't seen.

The last skill:

**[Charm: Charms a target, causing them to fall into a state of mental confusion. Duration depends on target's strength. Requires the host to say the command "Am I pretty?". Uses: 2, related to Revival Count.]**

"What the hell kind of skill is this?" Zhou Tian's face was utterly speechless. [Charm] – just by its name, it didn't sound like a proper skill. He immediately passed on it. "I'm pretty, my foot! I'll pretty you with a face full of blood!"

After reviewing all three skills, the one most suitable for Zhou Tian was currently [Attack Amplification]. Having made up his mind, he no longer hesitated and chose the [Attack Amplification] skill. A wave of understanding surged through his mind.

Outside, the World Origin completely vanished. To outsiders, it appeared as though Zhou Tian had absorbed it all. Zhou Tian slowly opened his eyes, floating mid-air. After all, he was a Law Manifestation Realm cultivator; flying was a given. He looked back at the giant Buddha Law Manifestation behind him, a helpless expression on his face.

"Little brother, why did you throw a Buddhist cultivation method at me?" As a direct descendant of the Zhou family, summoning a Buddha Law Manifestation during a fight in the future would feel incredibly strange. However, the situation was urgent then, and a large amount of essence was being wasted every moment, so he had no choice but to make do.

"Most of the top-tier cultivation methods I have here are Buddhist ones, and among them, this one is the best. Even *that person* once referenced this method. The others are just things like 'Crimson Fire Art,' 'Tiger Roar Art'..." Sheng Mo waved his hand and said.

"Alright," Zhou Tian replied, hearing those common names. He then recalled the name in the jade slip Sheng Mo had given him: "Myriad Life Pagoda Form" – its grade was indeed much higher, and it had even been used by Old Man Wutian.

"Boy, who exactly are you?" Yuan Chi asked with a gloomy face. Watching Zhou Tian and Sheng Mo converse as if no one else were present, completely disregarding him, filled him with burning rage.

"Oh, I almost forgot about you." Zhou Tian looked at Yuan Chi as if suddenly enlightened, making Yuan Chi so angry he almost spat blood.

"Child, child, I am your father." A unique rhythm flowed.

Yuan Chi's expression became blank. How many years had it been since anyone dared to speak to him like this? Was the name of the Yuan Mu clan useless now? He trembled all over, a dark light emanating from his body, his voice chilling, "Do you know why our clan is called Yuan Mu (Abyssal Tomb)?"

"Worlds dim, my body is the tomb!"

Yuan Chi's body exploded. Dark chains of order traversed the void. In the deepest part of the black mist, runes churned, and destructive energy flowed, as if something terrifying was about to emerge!
