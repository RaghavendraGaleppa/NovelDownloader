Chapter 132: Borrowing a Knife to Kill, Secretly Probing the Enemy

The Yellow Dragon Army’s Right Wing Guard, Han Kai, received Commander Qi Biao’s military order. Leading a dozen or so soldiers, he spent the night scouring the surrounding villages.

Han Kai rode a fierce steed, clad in silver armor. He turned back and said, “If you see a village, don’t kill indiscriminately. Use words to coax them. Have them bring money and grain, and follow us back to the camp willingly.”

One of his elite soldiers laughed. “We understand, Guard Han. If we killed them all, moving so many corpses would tire us to death.”

Another added, “Exactly. If the bodies grow maggots, they won’t be fresh to eat. We need to make them jump into the pot themselves when we’re hungry.”

“Good, good. You haven’t wasted my training.”

Han Kai nodded in satisfaction, spurring his horse into a gallop with a laugh. “These lowly commoners, being eaten by us is a blessing from their ancestors. When we achieve our great cause in the future, well... they can be considered to have contributed to the dragon.”

The soldiers all burst into laughter.

The night was pitch black. There were many villages around Qingning County. It didn’t take long to find one.

It was already late. Every household had their lights out and doors locked. It was eerily quiet.

Han Kai held the reins, slowing his pace, and shouted loudly, “Listen up, people inside! The Yellow Dragon Army is here to take you to a good life!”

“Get up, get up,” a soldier leader shouted. “We have good news. If you’re late, you won’t get a share!”

However, after shouting for a long time, there was no response. Sensing something was wrong, Han Kai dismounted and kicked open a door.

He found it empty inside...

Not a person in sight, not even a rat.

“Dammit!” Han Kai was furious. He kicked open doors one by one. The entire village was deserted, not a single grain of rice left.

“Lowly commoners, lowly commoners, lowly commoners!”

Han Kai had come for nothing. He hadn’t gotten any grain, nor had he been able to show off his might. A soldier leader asked, “Guard Han, what do we do now?”

Han Kai was already annoyed and had no idea. Being asked made him even more frustrated. He kicked the soldier.

“What else can we do? Keep searching other villages! I don’t believe it! Damn it, these lowly commoners are afraid of death, absolutely despicable!”

He led the team along the road, searching for villages. Every time they found one, they searched it, but they always came up empty.

They searched three villages in the night without a single harvest, not even a shadow of a person.

Early the next morning. Han Kai, utterly helpless, returned to report to the army. Qi Biao was waiting outside the tent. The soldiers were all hungry, and their grain was running out. They were just waiting for Han Kai to bring back meat and grain.

But Han Kai came back with a sallow face and empty hands.

Qi Biao flew into a rage. He immediately issued a deadly order, sending Han Kai out to search again. If he couldn’t find meat and grain, he would be executed by military law, beaten to death.

Han Kai turned pale. He had no choice but to grit his teeth and search.

However, the surrounding villages, for dozens of miles, he had already been to them all. There was no one. What could he do?

“The villagers are truly cunning. Where on earth are they hiding?!” Han Kai rushed about in a panic, his eyes wide with hunger and his heart pounding with fear.

Seeing the villages empty, he recklessly charged into the mountain forests to find people. By common sense, he was already insane.

He held out little hope. But as he walked through a forest, a rabbit suddenly darted out.

He spurred his horse to chase it. Just as the fat rabbit was about to be caught, a dense thicket blocked his path. The rabbit jumped and scurried away, disappearing.

“Even the trees are against me.”

“Is heaven truly trying to destroy me?”

“Wait, it seems the trees here are denser than elsewhere.”

Han Kai sat down with a thud.

Suddenly, he froze.

He looked closely. The vegetation around him was lush, but the soil showed signs of being disturbed. And even though it was heavily covered, the path worn by people passing through for years was still visible.

“Ah, I see, I see! A group of lowly commoners, so you were hiding here!” Han Kai’s eyes lit up. He abandoned his horse, pushed through the thicket, and walked a few more miles.

The view suddenly opened up, and a path appeared.

“Guard Han! We don’t have to die!” a soldier leader exclaimed excitedly.

“Naturally. These lowly commoners are cunning, but trying to fool me, Han Kai, is still not enough,” Han Kai laughed loudly.

He was walking forward with big strides.

Suddenly, a large net fell from the sky, trapping the whole group.

Han Kai was highly skilled. Although caught off guard, he rolled and dodged on the ground, narrowly avoiding it.

At that moment, several guards rushed out from the side, moving swiftly, striking with swords, spears, sticks, and clubs. The soldiers accompanying him had learned some military martial arts, but they were no match for the guards.

They were quickly killed.

However, Han Kai was Qi Biao’s right-hand man for a reason; he truly had formidable skills. Seeing the bad situation, he realized he had been careless and wanted to escape to call for help.

After the guards killed the accompanying soldiers, how could they let him escape? They immediately surrounded him again.

Han Kai fought with them, battling while retreating. Although he was at a disadvantage, he truly had a chance to escape.

Han Kai had thought this place was full of unruly commoners, but he didn’t expect so many of them to be so skilled.

“I am the Right Wing Guard of the Yellow Dragon Army! How dare you ambush me? Do you all have a death wish?!” Han Kai roared.

He was wearing silver armor. With the armor’s aid, his combat power was quite impressive.

Four hands are better than two fists. In fact, he should have been defeated long ago. But the armor blocked fatal blows for him. That allowed him to hold his own and even showed signs of retreating.

“You lot can’t take down me, Han Kai!” Han Kai, a veteran of many battles, had his killing intent ignited. He truly intimidated the guards.

He stomped his foot hard. The ground trembled. Vital energy surged into his chest and was then expelled from his mouth.

This was the “Yellow Dragon Roar,” a martial art used to provoke enemies on the battlefield.

He was about to escape.

An arrow shot from a bow flew over, piercing his knee and nailing him to the ground. Han Kai cried out in pain. The surrounding guards attacked.

“此人是右翼卫，且留他个活路。” (This man is the Right Wing Guard, leave him alive.)

Li Xian’s voice rang out.

The guards immediately stopped and stepped aside.

Han Kai gasped for breath, looking at the youth walking toward him. Even though he was severely injured and had no time to think too much, his mind was still stunned.

He thought to himself, what a miraculous young man. Distinguished and spirited, with cinnabar dots on his eyebrows.

“You shot me with a暗箭 (hidden arrow). What kind of hero are you?” Han Kai cursed.

Li Xian said indifferently, “I was never a hero.” He got straight to the point. “How many men does your Yellow Dragon Army have left? Where are you camped now? Who is your general?”

“Pah!” Han Kai spat out a mouthful of blood.

Li Xian didn’t waste words. From a distance, he struck with a palm. Palm force surged, hitting Han Kai’s other leg. He said, “I’ll only give you three chances. If you don’t speak, I’ll kill you.”

“How many men does your Yellow Dragon Army have left? How many days do you plan to stay?”

Han Kai had been a bully since joining the army. Now that he was being bullied, he was furious.

He gritted his teeth, wanting to fight back, but when he met Li Xian’s eyes, he couldn’t help but feel intimidated. He thought:

“This kid is ruthless. If I don’t speak, he will definitely kill me. I’ll tell the truth first to save my life. They don’t have enough men. Even if they know this, can they do anything to my Yellow Dragon Army? When Commander Qi leads the troops here, I’ll have my revenge!”

To save his life, he immediately told the Yellow Dragon Army’s situation.

The Yellow Dragon Army had 24,000 men left, but their supplies were exhausted. They probably couldn’t last another day. That was why they were acting desperately, raiding villages everywhere.

Li Xian felt a slight relief upon hearing this. “It seems I hid well. The Yellow Dragon Army couldn’t find my trail. This Right Wing Guard only reached this place by luck. But... I still can’t let my guard down.”

As he pondered this, he struck Han Kai dead with a palm.

Han Kai’s eyes widened, unable to understand this turn of events. He died with his eyes open, glaring at Li Xian. In truth, whether he spoke or not, the Yellow Dragon Army was right there. His final outcome was always death.

Li Xian ordered the guards to continue guarding the various key roads and setting traps.

He then left the manor again, traveling lightly.

“The Right Wing Guard said the Yellow Dragon Army is camped in the forest south of Qingning County. I’ll go take a look from a distance.”

Li Xian moved like a ghost, shuttling through the forest. He found a relatively distant mountain peak to observe. The Yellow Dragon Army had set up tents and buried iron pots. With so many people and such a large target, it was easy to spot.

Li Xian felt a slight joy. The situation was stable now. As long as the manor hid for two more days, the Yellow Dragon Army, unable to find food, would surely fall into chaos.

“I just need to stay here and observe quietly.”

Li Xian’s blade flashed, cutting some twigs and bushes. He draped them over himself to better conceal his figure, then stared into the distance.

With his terrifying eyesight, he could see the minute movements within the army. He could even locate the main command tent.

“That must be the Yellow Dragon Army’s commander. He truly looks ferocious. But even he has no solution right now; he looks anxious.”

Li Xian saw Qi Biao walking out of the tent from time to time. At the camp’s cooking spots, fires were burning with nothing but hot water and some coarse rice. The soldiers couldn’t get full.

The army’s mood was agitated.

“Rebel armies are like a gust of wind. Even if they don’t crash here, they won’t last long. If I were him, after capturing Xiang Le City, I would have managed it properly and bought people’s hearts. How could I end up in such a situation with no supplies?”

“In the end, these rebels will either be suppressed by the imperial court or scatter and turn to banditry, causing harm everywhere.”

Li Xian observed secretly.

Night fell in a blink. The night was lonely, and sounds carried far. He could faintly hear the commotion in the army, the discontent brewing.

The failure of the Yellow Dragon Army was foreseeable.

Li Xian felt a bit more at ease.

Just then, he suddenly saw a black dot in the distance. It was a figure, moving extremely fast, wearing a black robe that covered his face.

“This direction... it’s from Qingning County.” Li Xian’s dual pupils appeared, enhancing his vision further. He saw the man leaping and bounding, his steps as light as a飞 (flying creature). It looked somewhat familiar.

“This movement technique... I’ve seen it somewhere before. There are quite a few experts in Qingning County. Some dojo masters, gang leaders... have the strength to circulate Qi and close pores. If we dig deeper, there are probably quite a few at the ‘Food Essence’ level.”

“This swift movement technique is very similar to that of ‘Wang Bao’. But it’s even faster. So, this black-clothed man should be the Leopard Blade, Xu Liefeng.”

“He’s coming secretly; he must have ill intentions!”

Li Xian’s heart sank. He saw that the Yellow Dragon Army was on the verge of collapse, but now there was another variable.

He immediately observed carefully, wanting to see what strange things Xu Liefeng was up to.

Xu Liefeng ran through the night, climbed over the city wall, and headed straight for the Yellow Dragon Army.

He boldly entered through the main gate.

“Halt!” the sentry soldier shouted. “Who are you? Acting suspiciously.”

Xu Liefeng said arrogantly, “I am here to see your general. Go and report quickly. If you delay a major matter, you won’t be able to bear the consequences.”

“Where did this night owl come from, boasting so shamelessly? Capture him!” The soldier, seeing Xu Liefeng in black, was even more impolite, calling for the others to surround him.

Xu Liefeng snorted coldly and waved his sleeve.

The soldiers’ weapons all snapped in half.

Xu Liefeng said coldly, “I came here with sincerity. If you are sensible, go tell your general that I... can solve the Yellow Dragon Army’s urgent need.”

The soldiers saw Xu Liefeng’s martial arts were extraordinary. The army was in disarray now, and morale was low. They were afraid they couldn’t hold him.

After a moment of deliberation, they said, “Alright, wait here.” They went to notify Qi Biao.
