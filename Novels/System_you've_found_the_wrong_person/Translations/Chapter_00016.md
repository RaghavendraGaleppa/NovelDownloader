# Chapter 16: The Rivers and Lakes Are Vast, See You on the Human Rankings!

Late into the night.

Dou Changsheng successfully arrived at the agreed-upon location.

Upon arrival, he found the place completely deserted. He sat down cross-legged and began to wait.

Feng Zhongyi had truly entrusted his affairs to the wrong person. Dou Changsheng had no intention of revealing Feng's matters to anyone—he planned to take them to his grave.

To be perfectly honest...

That Five Qi Convergence innate realm martial artist had died too cleanly. Dou Changsheng suspected something was amiss.

But there was no need to dwell on it.

After all, he suspected the other party might have also noticed something unusual.

This chance encounter had ended in such a dramatic fashion—it could be considered a win-win situation.

After a while longer, Dou Changsheng heard footsteps approaching.

His hand instinctively gripped the hilt of his sword as he turned toward the source of the sound, slowly rising to his feet. Having little faith in his own luck, he feared it might be outsiders approaching.

If it turned out to be Feng Zhongyi again, that would be quite the amusing twist.

As the figures drew nearer, Dou Changsheng finally recognized them and breathed a sigh of relief—it was Tang He and his group.

All three looked utterly disheveled.

Their clothes bore scorch marks, with visible burns on their arms and legs.

Black Eagle Venerable fared the worst—his once flowing, elegant hair had been burned off, likely cut short with a sword to prevent the flames from spreading. Now sporting a cropped hairstyle, his entire demeanor had changed considerably.

The third person was someone Dou Changsheng recognized from a previous encounter—Zhao Manren.

When Zhao saw Dou Changsheng, a look of shame crossed his face as he spoke remorsefully: "I've failed Brother Dou's life-saving grace, failed the Military Governor's Office, and failed the people of the Northern Territories."

"The military pay under my custody... was stolen."

Zhao Manren let out a long sigh, his expression twisted in anguish, his entire being radiating defeat.

He collapsed onto the ground like a salted fish.

Anyone looking at him could tell—this man was broken.

Tang He accepted the water pouch Dou Changsheng handed him, taking several deep gulps to steady himself before speaking: "The elder has been rescued."

"Therefore, I won't be staying any longer. I'll be heading south tonight to return to my sect."

Hearing this, Black Eagle Venerable grew anxious and quickly interjected: "But we're in dire need of manpower now—"

Before he could finish, Tang He cut him off: "It's not that I fear danger. But after this mission to Sword Pass, I've realized this Northern Territories unrest stems from conflicts among northerners themselves."

"As an outsider, it's not my place to interfere."

"No matter what I do, I'd inevitably become an accomplice to one side oppressing another."

"Rescuing the elder was the limit of what I could do in good conscience."

With that, Tang He clasped his fists in salute and said to Dou Changsheng: "Take care, Brother Dou."

After taking a few steps, he suddenly turned back: "Brother Dou, your noble character rivals that of ancient sages."

"If you ever find yourself in difficult circumstances, come seek me in Jiangdu, Southern Chen."

"We'll roam the world with our swords and tour the landscapes of Jiangnan together."

With a flick of his wrist, Tang He sent a sword arcing beautifully through the air toward Dou Changsheng, who caught it by its scabbard.

Tang He's voice carried back as he walked away: "The sword you carry is of poor quality, Brother Dou, and even rusted."

"This blade of mine is named 'Hero.' It was given to me by my clan elders when I left Jiangdu, embodying their expectations."

"Though not a divine weapon, it's a fine blade beyond ordinary steel. With two taels of star iron within, it can split hairs with its edge."

"As the ancients said—a treasured sword for a heroic man. This blade I gift to you, Brother Dou!"

"When I emerge from closed-door cultivation, I'll be challenging the Human Rankings. Let us encourage each other!"

His voice faded until only the faintest whisper remained:

"The rivers and lakes are vast—we part here today. Though mountains and rivers divide us, we'll meet again!"

Dou Changsheng's fingers tightened around the scabbard as a pang of melancholy struck him.

Since entering Jun County and being swept into the Northern Territories conflict—though barely half a month had passed, most spent traveling with intermittent life-or-death battles—he had to admit the martial world held both peril and romance.

Tang He's gesture had caught him completely off guard.

The Hero's Sword.

Gifted to him, signifying that in Tang He's eyes, he was a true hero.

This blade carried heavy expectations.

Dou Changsheng knew he wasn't the selfless paragon Tang He imagined him to be.

How much of his rescue mission had been genuine concern? How much personal motive?

Even he couldn't say for certain.

Memories flashed through his mind.

Though their acquaintance had been brief, Tang He was undoubtedly a righteous man.

What did Northern Territories affairs matter to a Southern Chen citizen?

Yet he'd transported military pay across thousands of li and risked his life to rescue Black Eagle Venerable—both acts of pure chivalry.

Nor was Tang He alone—even the guilt-ridden Zhao Manren and Black Eagle Venerable had risked everything for the Northern Territories' sake.

Yet the Sword Pass garrison commander, the Barbarian-Subduing Commandant, wasn't wrong either.

Nor was he some villain.

Border troops resisted the Hu barbarians while their families suffered injustice at home. Military pay vanished without trace after traveling a thousand li from the capital, buried in a landslide.

They demanded justice. An explanation. For the entire nation to resist the Hu—not just locals sacrificing everything.

Liang Province and the capital enjoyed peace bought with northern lives, yet looked down upon and oppressed the very people protecting them.

Black Eagle Venerable roared in fury: "That demonic chancellor is ruining the nation!"

Finally unable to contain himself, he added in a low growl: "And that foolish emperor doting on his sorceress consort is no better either."

Turning to Dou Changsheng, the elder said gravely: "With Zhao Manren's military pay stolen, the Barbarian-Subduing Commandant can blame the Military Governor's Office for incompetence."

Dou Changsheng sighed: "The military pay was never the real issue."

"The Invincible Iron Fist Elder Yuan's Pure Yang Blood—the commandant destroyed it right before my eyes."

"The fact he didn't even consider refining it for profit shows the depth of his fury."

"This fire was lit because the Northern Pacification General failed to stand up for the north."

"What's military pay compared to the capital's wealth? Why has fundraising taken so long?"

"If Yu Yun wrote but a single letter, every northern officer and soldier would sign it."

"Then we'd ask the Son of Heaven in the capital—can you produce the funds or not?"
