# Chapter 29: Taming Demonic Beasts  

The crimson python was covered in hard scales, each as sharp as a blade, gleaming with a cold metallic sheen.  

Atop its head was a short, stubby horn that emitted an eerie glow.  

Meanwhile, the black streak that had descended from the sky now stood firmly beside Xiao Luo, guarding her protectively.  

It was a massive, pitch-black panther!  

The panther wasn’t overly large—only about three meters tall and six meters long.  

Yet, its muscles were densely packed, its body forged like steel, exuding an intimidating aura!  

This was a second-tier panther that had already ascended to third-tier magical power!  

The panther was clearly far stronger than the crimson python. With a single swipe of its paw, it sent the python crashing to the ground, completely immobilized!  

This was a complete suppression—in magic, strength, and presence!  

The python immediately became docile, no longer daring to bare its fangs at Xiao Luo.  

The panther lowered its head just enough for Xiao Luo to reach its chin.  

She vigorously rubbed the fur under its chin and said,  

"Runrun, this is my bonded beast, Matcha! I’ve been raising her since she was a first-tier [Emerald Blossom Panther]. But she’s gotten darker and darker—not as pretty as when she was little!"  

The panther’s intelligence was no less than that of a human. Upon hearing Xiao Luo’s words, it rolled its eyes dramatically.  

Han Yue still thought "Han the Blade" sounded much cooler and suited his temperament better, but "Han Runrun" had a certain comforting ring to it, so he reluctantly accepted it.  

Xiao Luo then turned to the python by the shore and said,  

"Go ahead and eat. Grow up quickly—I want to return to the sect as soon as possible!"  

The python silently slithered forward, clamped its jaws around the wild boar demon beast’s neck, and dragged it back into the pond.  

Sensing its impending doom, the boar struggled desperately, but the python had already coiled around its torso, tightening its grip until the boar could no longer move.  

With a splash, the python submerged into the water, vanishing from Han Yue’s sight.  

Xiao Luo turned back to Han Yue and explained,  

"This second-tier [Horned Crimson Python] took me over three years to find in these outer lands. It’s one of the rare second-tier demon beasts with the potential to reach the fourth tier."  

"So this is the 'Great Dragon' you’re raising?" Han Yue asked.  

"Exactly! In about a year, this [Horned Crimson Python] should reach the peak of the second tier. By then, it’ll be fully tamed, and I can take it with me!"  

"Once I reach the fourth tier, it can evolve into a [Four-Clawed Crimson Dragon]!"  

"Right now, I feed it a second-tier demon beast every other day. With the secret techniques of my [Beast Taming Sect], its growth is incredibly fast!"  

Han Yue nodded in admiration. Cultivators from established sects with complete legacies were truly different!  

Unlike him, Xiao Luo had a clear path forward. She knew exactly how to strengthen herself and was actively working toward it.  

Meanwhile, Han Yue was still searching for his own path to immortality.  

Xiao Luo patted Matcha’s fur, and the panther swiftly returned to its post atop the nearby mountain.  

Its duty was to guard the [Horned Crimson Python], preventing it from escaping—or being hunted by others.  

Then, Xiao Luo led Han Yue to a clearing by the mountainside.  

From her storage artifact, she retrieved a small wooden house figurine. With a flick of her fingers and an incantation, she tossed it onto the ground.  

Instantly, a wooden courtyard materialized before them.  

Xiao Luo pushed open the gate and invited Han Yue to sit with her in the pavilion at the center of the courtyard.  

After being isolated in these distant outer lands for so long, her pent-up desire for conversation burst forth. She eagerly bombarded Han Yue with questions.  

She had long heard of Flesh Divide Market—a unique place teeming with cultivators of all kinds, bustling trade, and abundant delicacies, a rarity among cultivation factions.  

"Brother Han, given how fast you run, you must have awakened a movement-type divine ability, right?"  

"I’ll be staying here for quite a while—at least a year, possibly even two or three."  

"If you can make trips between here and Flesh Divide Market, I’d like to ask you to help me procure some materials. I’ve been in these outer lands for nearly four years, and my supplies are running low."  

"I’ll trade you hunted second-tier demon beasts in return—I promise you won’t lose out!"  

Han Yue readily agreed. He was already hunting second-tier demon beasts to sell, so bringing along Xiao Luo’s items was no trouble at all.  

Moreover, opportunities to interact with disciples of prestigious sects were rare, and Han Yue was more than happy to foster a good relationship with her.  

Xiao Luo handed him a corpse storage pouch and said,  

"Inside are materials from two second-tier demon beasts. I’ll count them as fifty mid-grade spirit stones for you."  

Then she passed him a treasure pouch and a list.  

"The items I need are on this list. In my estimation, the total shouldn’t exceed thirty mid-grade spirit stones."  

"Help me sell the demon beasts and bring back the materials. Once the trade is complete, any remaining profit is yours. Does that sound fair?"  

Xiao Luo’s tone grew more serious when discussing business.  

Han Yue didn’t even need to calculate carefully to recognize the enormous profit margin. At twenty-five mid-grade spirit stones per beast, the price was already half of what merchant houses typically offered!  

Add in the profits from procuring the materials, and this deal could easily earn him more than hunting on his own!  

This was a deal he absolutely had to take!  

For Xiao Luo, having a trade channel in these remote outer lands was far more crucial.  

The [Horned Crimson Python] was tied to her path of cultivation. After spending years searching for it, she dared not stray too far.  

But being stuck here meant her critical cultivation resources were running out with no way to replenish them, severely hindering her progress.  

Moreover, due to limited storage space, the demon beast materials she had gathered had already reached their capacity.  

Even if she hunted more, she couldn’t preserve the materials—wasting both time and energy.  

Thus, Han Yue’s ability to facilitate this trade was invaluable to her.  

She was eager to secure this arrangement, which was why she had been so open and friendly upon meeting him.  

In her eyes, Han Yue had risked traversing thousands of miles to get here—he absolutely deserved to earn a hefty profit.  

Even if he drove a hard bargain, she would grit her teeth and accept it.
