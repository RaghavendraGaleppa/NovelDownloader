# Chapter 92: The Fifth Divine Ability

Han fled desperately, covering over ten thousand miles in a short time, putting great distance between himself and Iron-Eater City. 

Unable to determine whether the other party truly harbored ill intentions, he could only avoid potential danger as much as possible.

But suddenly, Han stopped mid-flight.

A strange transformation was occurring within his body!

Descending swiftly, Han landed in a secluded valley to carefully observe this abrupt change. 

Within his sea of consciousness, a small white lotus inexplicably bloomed, emanating a mysterious aura that enveloped his soul. Han immediately summoned his [Soul-Nurturing Banner], its radiance clashing against the white lotus's influence. 

Yet upon contact, even the banner was tainted by this energy, falling into a deep slumber.

The power of the longevity treasure [Heartlink] had manifested!

This treasure, forged from the supreme divine ability of the Great Sage Huamo, allowed two cultivators to form an unbreakable spiritual contract. Now activated, it served as the most sophisticated method to bind Han and Wubing as fated spirit companions. 

Remarkably, this treasure's connection spanned tens of thousands of miles, ensnaring Han despite the distance.

As the white lotus merged with Han's consciousness, he sensed Wubing's presence on the other end. The pandas had sacrificed a top-tier fourth-grade treasure just to shackle him.

Fury surged through Han. 

He had fallen prey to the pandas' scheme!

This was utterly unacceptable!

Summoning the [Ten Thousand Methods Compendium], Han flipped to its eighth page and slammed his palm upon it, inputting his memories.

"Ding! Conditions met for ability extraction. Proceed?"

"Current keyword: Soul!"

"Extract!"

"Ding! Congratulations! You've obtained the divine ability [Seven Phoenixes Supreme Heart Demon Curse]!"

Instantly, a mysterious power flowed from the compendium as a stele-like sigil shot into Han's sea of consciousness, merging with his spirit.

Seven heart demon curses coursed through Han's mind: [Netherflame Curse], [Pure Yang Heart Curse], [Wishful Thunder Curse], [Five Plagues Curse], [Bodhi Heart Curse], [Thousand Illusions Curse], and [Vajra King Curse].

The [Vajra King Curse] embedded itself deepest—this central curse served as the core controlling mechanism for the other six, a soul technique capable of achieving true enlightenment.

Han's consciousness underwent rapid restructuring under the curse's influence, transforming from liquid-like dispersion into diamond-hard solidity—a qualitative leap. 

From this moment, Han's spiritual power advanced to the second rank, matching the soul strength of second-tier cultivators in the Jade Firmament Realm. His sea of consciousness doubled in size while his refined spiritual energy, now denser, occupied only a tenth of the space.

His mental processing speed and comprehension abilities multiplied exponentially. Even his mana circulation accelerated under enhanced spiritual control.

Mastering the [Vajra King Curse] instantly, Han understood its function—this technique excelled at controlling minds and corrupting spirits. 

Though victims would gain boosted spiritual and magical power, they'd become puppets with their lives hanging by a thread. As the curse's originator, Han could theoretically unleash a catastrophic demonic scourge across the realm. 

But with countless powerhouses in the Jade Firmament Realm, such recklessness was unthinkable.

Now equipped against the white lotus's influence, Han channeled the [Pure Yang Heart Curse] into it. The curse contaminated the [Heartlink] treasure's energy, transmitting directly to Wubing's consciousness.

Han had successfully implanted the curse deep within Wubing's mind, turning the panda into one of his six core curse vessels. Neither [Heartlink] nor Wubing could threaten him anymore—the scheming panda had become a controlled asset.

Only then did Han begin accepting [Heartlink]'s power properly.

"You might have forced this bond, but you'll regret it," Han thought grimly.

The fourth-grade treasure's true capabilities emerged. As the pinnacle achievement of Great Sage Huamo's cultivation, its value surpassed ordinary longevity treasures.

Beyond forging spiritual contracts, [Heartlink] possessed another critical function—it allowed contracted parties to exchange an innate divine ability, mutually enhancing their cultivation paths.

Remarkably, the system recognized Han's [Pure Yang Heart Curse] as a fourth-grade ability, which Wubing willingly accepted.

In return, Wubing transmitted its sole innate divine ability to Han. As the mystical sigil entered his consciousness, the compendium immediately absorbed and cataloged it.

The exchange complete, Han had profited handsomely—trading one curse for a purple-grade supreme ability plus a second-tier spirit beast. Though the contract had been forced upon him, the [Heartdevil Curse] ensured his control.

With five curses remaining, he could theoretically bind more creatures. Even if future spirit companions proved useless, they wouldn't hinder him. Disposing of unsatisfactory partners remained an option—with the curse's power, Han could easily renege on any [Heartlink] contract.

Taking a deep breath, Han reviewed his updated status:
