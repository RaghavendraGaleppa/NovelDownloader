Chapter 254: Thunderfire Refines the Golden Core Within the Abdomen

The night sky was a thick, inky black, as if congealed.

Deep within the River and Mountain Academy, a tall tower stood silently, its stone surface rough and ancient, its body seemingly soaring into the clouds.

In the distance, electrical arcs tore through the darkness. Soon, a light drizzle began to fall.

*Crack!*
A crimson lightning bolt struck the tall tower. Instantly, the special metal tiles seemed to be covered in a sunset glow, crimson inlaid with golden edges.

Moreover, glowing "embroidered balls" rolled around on the tiles.

"Little Qin, if it gets too much, run out quickly." Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan were inside the tower, but not within the lightning-attracting zone.

They were genuinely worried; the young man they valued so highly was too reckless.

Lightning pierced the night sky, bringing down a large amount of Heavenly Light, accompanied by some unfathomable substances from beyond this world.

After being "filtered" by the metal tiles inscribed with special runes, the Heavenly Light and the Pure Qi of the Nine Heavens, along with other otherworldly substances, descended into the high tower.

In the quiet room, built from rough stones, it was anything but quiet now. Qin Ming was enveloped by the pouring Heavenly Light, his body becoming transparent.

"The Heavenly Light contained in summer lightning is indeed violent. Compared to spring thunder, which holds traces of vigorous life energy, it is far more destructive."

This was Qin Ming's true feeling. No wonder even those who fought with their lives on the line only chose the first thunderfire of early spring for their adventure.

However, he was no longer the naive person he once was. After reaching the Second Realm, he had greater resistance to the invasion of Heavenly Light.

He only endured three waves of Heavenly Light before the area dimmed.

During the rainy season, the weather was unpredictable.

This was just a shower, short-lived, and it soon stopped.

Qin Ming was not in a hurry; he had plenty of time and planned to eat and live in the tower.

Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan rushed in immediately. Seeing that only his clothes were burned through and torn by the Heavenly Light, and his skin was merely slightly reddened, they felt relieved.

At the same time, they were deeply shocked. This young man was undergoing cleansing by otherworldly Heavenly Light in the Second Realm. If this were to spread, it would undoubtedly cause a huge uproar.

"Brother Ming, I heard you're getting struck by lightning! I'm here to keep you company!" Xiao Wu arrived, entering the tall tower with a look of shock, but also considerable excitement.

He had always looked up to Qin Ming, even aiming to match his cultivation realm.

"It's Ethereal Heavenly Light!" Qin Ming corrected him. The tall tower filtered out the thunder.

Xiao Wu said, "It's close enough. In many people's eyes, it's no different from thunderfire, equally terrifying."

Qin Ming was very serious. "You haven't experienced this. Don't take unnecessary risks. Just try a little contact first."

This was no joke. Back in the Thunderfire Alchemist Palace, there were severed limbs and shattered skulls everywhere, filled with the strong smell of roasted flesh. Many old people had gone in wearing burial shrouds, as it was a desperate choice made when their lives were nearing their end.

Wu Yaozu nodded solemnly. "I know. If things go wrong, I'll retreat immediately."

Half a day later, another wave of lightning descended, and spherical lightning appeared on the tall tower.

Inside the core area of the tower, Xiao Wu wailed like a ghost, smoke rising from his body, Heavenly Light spewing from his mouth, his eyes staring blankly. He was completely stiff, unable to move even if he wanted to run.

He felt like he was about to be cooked, and he even started talking nonsense.

Qin Ming quickly threw him out.

Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan were waiting outside and stepped forward to examine him.

It took Xiao Wu a long time to recover, and a wave of lingering fear washed over him. "In that moment, I felt like I saw my great-grandmother."

Even though most of his clan had died out by the time he was born, leaving only his grandmother by his side, it didn't stop him from suspecting that the white-haired old woman he saw in his dazed consciousness was an ancestor coming to "guide" him on his way.

Xiao Wu was completely convinced. He truly couldn't compare everything to Brother Ming; some aspects were simply incomparable!

"You've done well too, enduring three waves of Heavenly Light cleansing from summer lightning without major injury to your body," Qin Ming walked out.

This was still a passing shower, only bringing down four waves of Heavenly Light, which was too short for him.

"Indeed, that's already very remarkable!" Even Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan exclaimed in admiration.

Xiao Wu shook his head. "Compared to Brother Ming, it's still far off. I almost got cooked."

Then, he touched his head and immediately let out a shriek.

Because his short hair, upon his touch, all turned to ash and fell down, leaving him completely bald.

Next, it continued to be just a light drizzle and occasional lightning flashes, far from the torrential lightning Qin Ming craved.

During this time, Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan brought some bad news.

It was said that the Ancestor Assembly was still ongoing.

And during this period, one ancestor reportedly coughed up blood. It was unclear if this was due to old age and physical deterioration after a major battle, or if he was feigning it.

Outside, many people were speculating.

Many believed he was baiting, not truly decaying.

However, Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan didn't think so. They felt that some ancestors might achieve rebirth, while others might fail their nirvana.

"In the coming period, the number of ancestors might be halved!"

This was their pessimistic prediction. If an ancestor risked their life to take that step, the success rate for rebirth was probably only fifty percent.

Qin Ming's heart instantly grew heavy. The sense of relaxation he had felt in recent days vanished in an instant, and he once again felt a strong sense of crisis.

He asked, "What does the Immortal Path think? Will they not start a war again?"

Zhao Ziyuan shook his head. "No, there will be a grand reclamation in the future, and internal strife is really not suitable right now."

Most importantly, a few days ago, the ancestors of the Rebirth Path engaged in a bloody battle on the plateau, which cleared the eyes of the Immortal Path's ancestors, making them very rational recently.

Li Qingyue arrived, knowing that Qin Ming was cleansing his body with Heavenly Light, and was quite worried, entering the tall tower to observe.

"Is this Sister-in-law?" Xiao Wu was also there, greeting her enthusiastically.

Then, he looked at Qin Ming with "resentment" and said, "Brother Ming, when did you break your 'destined to be alone' constitution?"

"Go stand aside!"

"Alright, alright, I'm perceptive. I'll move out of your way, isn't that enough?" He immediately got up.

Li Qingyue was very composed and calm. Facing his jokes, she didn't show the usual shyness of a young girl, nor did she feel the need to explain anything.

Her bright, ethereal, and composed near-immortal aura made Xiao Wu himself reluctant to tease her further.

"Are you alright doing this?" Li Qingyue looked at Qin Ming, asking with concern.

Seeds of the Immortal Path generally began their preliminary "tribulation" or bathed the spiritual light of their consciousness in immortal flame to transform into Pure Yang state from the Third Realm onwards.

Qin Ming had just stepped into the Second Realm and was already undergoing a full-scale "thorough cleansing" with otherworldly Heavenly Light. This was truly astounding.

"No worries, I can endure it. This might be the most effective way for me to break free from the cage of the Rebirth Path and achieve a life-level leap, unhindered by time."

Li Qingyue understood his feelings. Several ancestors of the Rebirth Path were likely to pass away soon, and in the future, there might be a crisis of being suppressed by the outer realms and esoteric sects.

Moreover, the Great Genesis was about to arrive. At that time, with a hundred schools contending and a thousand sails racing, if Qin Ming remained trapped at the bottom, how could he compete with other paths?

This was a grand era, where cultivation methods were just emerging, and anything was possible. Many people harbored ambitions, wanting to seek truth, transcend gods, and become ancestors!

Li Qingyue informed him, "Jiang Ran should arrive in two days. Even without the *Black and White Scripture*, I can still get the *Eight Sceneries Scripture* from her."

Luo Yao's elder sister, the green-clothed girl named Jiang Ran who had obtained the greatest fortune in Black and White Mountain, was currently the strongest Near-Immortal Seed in the Immortal Land!

Qin Ming shook his head. "No need to owe her a favor. It's just twelve pages of the *Black and White Scripture*; give it to her!"

Then, he called Xiao Wu into the quiet room, preparing to teach them how to cultivate this extraordinary technique.

Before long, both Li Qingyue and Wu Yaozu frowned. The requirements for getting started with this scripture were simply too high.

"The Heavenly Light, divine wisdom, and spiritual light of consciousness must merge, and furthermore, one must cultivate the Four Imperial Strengths," Xiao Wu sighed helplessly, feeling like he should give up.

"A special Pure Yang spiritual light of consciousness should be able to replace the Four Imperial Strengths, and if your Divine Rainbow is strong enough, it might also substitute," Qin Ming said. After all, this was a technique from a divine immortal's dojo.

He speculated that the orthodox method should prioritize Pure Yang consciousness, supplemented by Heavenly Light strength.

Li Qingyue pondered, "Hmm, this means the Pure Yang spiritual light of consciousness needs to reach the level of four-sun superposition to cultivate the first twelve pages of the *Black and White Scripture*. As for the later texts, I estimate the requirements will be even more outrageous."

***

The torrential lightning Qin Ming had been waiting for finally arrived!

Li Qingyue and Xiao Wu both retreated from the quiet room, watching from outside as Heavenly Light poured down, enveloping the young man within.

"How many layers of Heavenly Light have fallen? More than eighteen waves, right?" Yu Gensheng's face was filled with solemnity. Too much Heavenly Light was being absorbed!

Inside the quiet room, Qin Ming's body was scalding hot, like a glowing hot iron, making people worry he might melt.

He had many extraordinary arts to cultivate, from the Five Elements Principles to the Dragon Snake Scripture, then the Golden Cicada Scripture and the Undying Butterfly Scripture. Now that he had reached the Second Realm, these techniques should also be upgraded.

In the past, at the First Realm, their later sections were too difficult to cultivate, but now they were naturally not a problem.

Relatively speaking, these advancements were naturally flowing.

As for the Silk Book Art, it had already integrated into his flesh and blood!

Clearly, his Heavenly Light volume was increasing significantly.

"No wonder some people cultivated the Three Imperial Strengths in the First Realm, while at the Ancestor Realm, the upper limit is only Six Imperial Strengths. The further one goes, the harder it is to improve."

At this moment, Qin Ming had an epiphany.

It was like a child with excellent physique in childhood. As they grew older, although they appeared taller and their "volume" increased, their physique might not necessarily be better than before. In fact, if malnourished or lacking exercise, they might even become sickly.

However, for Qin Ming, this was not a major problem.

He tempered his body with Heavenly Light, and this violent cleansing, as long as he didn't die, would definitely not lead to the degradation of Heavenly Light strength while his volume increased.

He clearly felt that the Four Imperial Strengths had improved, but the increase was not as significant as before.

"It seems that refining alien substances and cultivating other extraordinary arts are all very necessary!"

The Essence of Starlight, legendary Star Fiends, etc., all belonged to branches of Heavenly Light. Qin Ming planned to refine them after leaving this place. Today, the main purpose was to borrow otherworldly Heavenly Light to cultivate extraordinary arts.

Heavenly Light shone brightly, accompanied by other mysterious substances from beyond, submerging Qin Ming.

The extraordinary arts he had learned in the First Realm continuously circulated, all undergoing a complete sublimation!

The next choice was naturally very important. He first chose the *Wither-Flourish Scripture*, followed by the *Black and White Scripture*.

This was because the subsequent path in the Second Realm primarily relied on these two scriptures as guides to advance quickly!

A moment later, Qin Ming underwent astonishing changes. His black hair lost its luster, turning stark white. This was the embodiment of the true meaning of wither. He seemed to have aged a hundred years in an instant.

If this Heavenly Light strength were unleashed on an opponent, it would be terrifying.

Soon, however, his body became vibrant and flourishing again, rapidly recovering. His black hair regrew, and his flesh and blood became as translucent and crystalline as divine glass.

The *Wither-Flourish Scripture* contained the principles of life and death, as well as an understanding of Yin and Yang.

In the past, Qin Ming had coveted it for a long time. Recently, he not only obtained it but also cultivated it to great completion here.

Afterward, he began to cultivate the *Black and White Scripture*.

Instantly, black and white light intertwined and surged around his body, gradually forming an incredibly harmonious black and white Yin-Yang diagram, which was astonishing.

Not just Qin Ming himself, but even the few people outside the quiet room felt its profundity. This miraculous sight was truly exceptional and extraordinary!

Qin Ming took a deep breath, calming himself. He was sure that the *Black and White Scripture* was more powerful than the *Wither-Flourish Scripture* and better suited for him. This should be his primary scripture at present.

"Hmm, in the early stage of the Second Realm, one can only add two or three new extraordinary arts. Cultivating more than that would cause some discomfort."

This was Qin Ming's experience. Primarily, the Five Elements Arts, Dragon Snake Scripture, and others from earlier had also advanced, requiring him to temper and integrate them.

Qin Ming knew to stop while he was ahead, leaving room for the *Eight Sceneries Scripture*.

He still had other extraordinary arts in his possession, but it wasn't suitable to cultivate them further at the moment. He needed to reach the middle stage of the Second Realm before continuing.

After cultivating the *Black and White Scripture*, he began the Dragon-Tiger merging medicine, using the principles of the Silk Book Art to control various methods, starting the fusion as a great medicine for internal refinement.

Not long after, amidst the dazzling Heavenly Light, a Golden Core formed within Qin Ming's body, illuminating all his flesh and blood, and emanating a genuine medicinal fragrance.

This was without even merging the Essence of Starlight, Star Fiends, and other substances; merely refining various "extraordinary art great medicines" had already achieved this, filling Qin Ming with anticipation for the future.

At this moment, he clearly felt that his physique, Heavenly Light, and everything else were improving.

When the torrential lightning disappeared, his entire body was clear and bright, and a Golden Core had been refined to a perfect and flawless state.

"Hiss!" Yu Gensheng gasped, inhaling the night mist. "Exactly thirty-six waves of Heavenly Light, each surging like a tide. That number is quite marvelous."

Li Qingyue's beautiful eyes gleamed upon hearing this. "It's a bit like the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation from ancient legends."
