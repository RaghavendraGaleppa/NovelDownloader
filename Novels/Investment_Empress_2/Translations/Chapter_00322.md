# Chapter 322: As Your Backing

Little Li’s face was squished into all sorts of shapes by two delicate, boneless hands.

The Ice Cube wasn’t joking around, but she didn’t say anything. She just looked at him with those beautiful, deep eyes, making his heart race with unease.

It was a bit hard to bear.

There were many reasons Li Mo wanted to stay, but the Ice Cube’s reason wasn’t so complicated—it was all for one person.

So, Little Li simply couldn’t bear to leave.

Gently, he took her fair little hands. Her fingers were a bit cold, so he began to warm them up.

Rubbing her hands, Li Mo said, “I have a method to travel thousands of miles in an instant, and I also have the Buddhist beads from Brother Mu Rong, which can take me back to the Suspended Temple in a flash...”

“I always have a way out. But even though your speed is fast, you might not be able to escape whenever you want.”

“Moreover, the soldiers in the city now see me as their pillar of support. If even I leave, what confidence will they have to fight with their lives on the line?”

“Han Zhen will not let this go.”

“Next time we face him, we won’t have an army at our backs.”

Gradually, the small hand in his palm grew warm.

It was strange.

This was the hand that held a sword to slay demons and vanquish monsters, yet holding it in his palm, it felt so soft and fragrant.

In the end, it was Li Mo who didn’t want to let go.

Ying Bing lowered her gaze to look at the youth. From his usually boyish and bright face, she saw a determination and resolve unlike before.

As long as Han Zhen lived, the crisis in Qingmu City would be difficult to resolve.

As long as Han Zhen lived, there would always be people coveting the Nine Souls of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix, leading to endless future troubles.

But Han Zhen wasn’t alone; behind him were the Demon Summoning Cult and the remnants of the Great Shang Dynasty.

“He’s just the Great Shang’s Imperial Preceptor.”

“I want to try and end this in one fell swoop.”

Li Mo didn’t show a sunny smile. Instead, he imitated the Ice Cube’s expression, looking cold and confident.

An Ice Cube face, Little Li version.

“Imitating me?”

Ying Bing pulled her hand back and began to rub his face, kneading his cool expression into all sorts of comical shapes with practiced ease, just like molding a dough doll.

But as she watched Little Li’s handsome, bright face get rubbed into various silly shapes, she couldn’t help but smile, the ice and snow melting from her jade-like face.

“Then I definitely can’t leave.”

“Huh?”

“The soldiers all rely on you, so how can you have no one to rely on?”

Ying Bing said while tugging on his face.

“Ice Cube...”

She retracted her smile. Seeing the seriousness in her expression, Li Mo’s heart skipped a beat.

Translating that sentence, it meant...

Wouldn’t it be fine if I became your backing?

And she said it so seriously.

Somehow, when the Ice Cube says such things in her cold and clear voice, it feels especially domineering.

“Let’s go, let’s head back first.”

Li Mo thought about it and agreed.

Since he had decided to give it his all, from this moment on, he needed to adjust his condition to its peak.

He truly needed a quiet place.

He had been too busy after comprehending the Somersault Cloud.

He still hadn’t had the time to continue deducing the “Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao.”

...

In the central command tent.

Qu Sheng had finally finished deploying the battle plan for tomorrow with the other generals.

The generals had all gone to attend to their military duties. He sat alone in his seat, polishing a long spear he hadn’t used in years.

As an outer realm martial artist, he hadn’t personally fought in a long time.

A lifetime of campaigning had left him with many lingering and hidden injuries. Besides, as the commander, he couldn’t charge into battle with the soldiers.

Unless it was absolutely necessary.

---

Polishing the spearhead, he seemed to think of something and asked his personal guard, “Where are Young Hero Li and the Cold Fairy?”

“Commander, the two have already left the camp.”

“Good, it’s good that they left...”

Qu Sheng muttered to himself, as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.

He lowered his head, looking at his old companion, now polished to a shine, its reflection in the candlelight revealing a pair of weary eyes.

At one time, those eyes were full of spirit and vigor.

Picking up the long spear again, he seemed to be looking at his younger self in a daze, lost in thought.

...

In the Jia Wei Restaurant, in the same private room.

The streets were now empty, every household with their doors shut. The sugar painting stall was gone, and the restaurant owner, missing an arm, had joined the militia to help transport supplies.

The private room was quiet.

The light from the Jade Phoenix God was particularly bright and mystical tonight.

He could feel it.

The Ice Cube was about to take another step on the path of the Hundred Birds Phoenix Form.

Li Mo looked at her for a moment before taking out the “Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao.”

Finally, he could continue to deduce this ultimate form.

Perhaps calling it an ultimate form wasn’t accurate.

The divine ability imprinted on his soul by this diagram was something that could not be obtained by observing any other divine intent. It was merely that those divine abilities were preserved in the manner of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths Divine Observation Diagram.

And this was just an ultimate form.

What would it be like if it were a Great Dao Divine Form?

Li Mo’s eyes shone with a firm light as he took out the Golden Creation Seal.

This small seal, containing infinite mysteries and worthy of being called a creation, was slowly stamped onto the diagram.

*Hum—*

The moment the Creation Seal was stamped down.

The stone monkey divine pattern on Li Mo’s soul let out a deafening bell-like chime that only he could hear. It seemed to have formed a connection with the rapidly evolving figure within the diagram.

It seemed... ‘excited’?

Just as excited as Li Mo was in his heart.

Tadpole-like patterns, like golden flames, burned the “Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao” to ashes, turning it into wisps of pale golden light that flowed into the divine pattern on Li Mo’s soul.

In his eyes, a赤 golden fire began to spread.

“Hm?”

Ying Bing gently opened her eyes and looked at the youth whose back was turned to her.

She saw him sitting there perfectly fine, as if his mind were wandering.

And yet, she felt...

He had become a little different?

Ying Bing could only vaguely sense it; she truly couldn’t see the scene in Li Mo’s eyes.

The aura was constantly gathering.

It made Li Mo feel as if his soul had left his body and arrived in another world.

He looked up.

He saw a scene of a Heavenly Palace, far more real, magnificent, and wondrous by a thousand times than the one in his small world, standing atop the white clouds.

And the figures standing on the clouds, though not tall in stature, had气势 that reached the heavens.

The wind blew from the sky.

It also brought a killing intent that descended from above and the sound of banners flapping in the wind. He couldn’t see the expressions on those figures clearly, but they were far, far stronger than any martial artist Li Mo had ever seen.

If he were to compare the pressure to that of a disaster beast attacking the city, it would be like a firefly compared to the bright moon.

And yet, the killing intent that rained down like arrows could not extinguish a single torch.

Those two points of light were like eternally burning flames, seeming to illuminate all falsehoods in the world. Though the gaze was looking into the distance, it felt as if it had never left his body.

The body, wrapped in golden chainmail, was somewhat slender. A golden phoenix-tipped purple gold crown stood tall on his head. In his hand was an iron rod with golden bands at both ends clasping the dark iron, and near the bands was a line of engraved characters.

Li Mo was momentarily stunned.
