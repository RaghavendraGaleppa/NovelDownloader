# Chapter 28: Ice Needle Technique  

Lin Xuan began practicing his second spell—the Ice Needle Technique.  

Though classified as a mid-tier technique, it was rather special because its power could rival many high-tier techniques typically only cultivable after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage.  

In the cultivation world, spells were divided into three grades. Setting aside the low-tier ones, how were mid-tier and high-tier techniques distinguished?  

By their power?  

Yes, but that wasn’t the whole story. The main criterion was that mid-tier techniques could be cultivated during the Agile Pulse stage, while high-tier techniques required reaching Foundation Establishment.  

Generally, high-tier techniques had higher requirements and thus greater power. But exceptions existed, and among mid-tier techniques, there was one unique outlier—the Ice Needle Technique!  

It could be cultivated during the Agile Pulse stage, yet its power was no weaker than some high-tier spells. This discrepancy had even sparked debates among senior cultivators, with some arguing it should be reclassified as a high-tier technique.  

For unknown reasons, however, the proposal was rejected, and the Ice Needle Technique remained classified as mid-tier—though undeniably the strongest among them. Some even jokingly called it the "pseudo-mid-tier technique."  

At first glance, the Ice Needle Technique seemed incredibly enticing—cultivable at the Agile Pulse stage yet rivaling high-tier spells. One might assume every low-level disciple would rush to learn it, but reality was different. Nothing came without a price. Just as greater effort yielded greater rewards, while the Ice Needle Technique was unmatched among mid-tier spells, its difficulty was equally notorious.  

Its demands on spiritual power weren’t particularly high, but mastering it required exceptionally strong divine sense. The technique involved condensing moisture in the air into hundreds of ice needles, each as hard as steel, and then controlling them to attack enemies.  

Though each needle was small, simultaneously manipulating hundreds placed an unimaginable strain on one’s divine sense, making practice extremely arduous. Over the centuries, countless Agile Pulse cultivators had attempted it, but only a handful succeeded. Mastering the Ice Needle Technique before Foundation Establishment demanded extraordinary perseverance.  

Lin Xuan’s notes were detailed, containing not only the cultivation method but also the instructor’s warnings.  

The challenges were clear, but Lin Xuan wasn’t deterred. If nothing else, he had absolute confidence in his willpower. The Path of Tempering the Heart was something only Foundation Establishment cultivators dared attempt, yet he had endured its illusory trials.  

The power of the Ice Needle Technique was too tempting—mastering it would significantly boost his strength. There was no way he would back down.

Lin Xuan threw himself into cultivation, but the difficulty exceeded his expectations. In the first few days, he made almost no progress. Even though his divine sense far surpassed that of disciples at his level, practicing the Ice Needle Technique still pushed him to his limits.  

For most people, failing once or twice at a task—or a spell—was normal. Failing three or four times was still bearable. But after seven or eight failures, or even more, most would grow disheartened and give up.  

This wasn’t necessarily a lack of patience—it was human nature. But Lin Xuan was different. His will was unbreakable. Back when he had no purification ability and knew how difficult cultivation was for ordinary people, he had persisted despite mockery.  

Just breaking through to the second layer of the Agile Pulse stage had taken him dozens of failed attempts, yet he had never wavered.  

So, even after days of no progress with the Ice Needle Technique, Lin Xuan felt neither discouragement nor impatience. He continued practicing with unwavering focus.  

The instructor had made it clear: though only a rare few Agile Pulse disciples had mastered the technique over millennia, some had succeeded. If others could do it, why couldn’t he?  

With this relentless mindset, Lin Xuan trained tirelessly, failing repeatedly but growing more determined with each setback. Finally, after two months, he achieved minor success with the Ice Needle Technique.  

Compared to the three days it took him to master the Spiritual Shield, this seemed slow. But in reality, it was anything but. Records showed that even Foundation Establishment experts typically took about two months to learn the Ice Needle Technique. Lin Xuan’s progress was astonishingly fast.  

His success stemmed from two factors: his unyielding perseverance and his daily consumption of large quantities of Marrow-Cleansing Pills.  

Nine pills a day—one of them a precious mid-grade pill—not only accelerated his cultivation but also greatly aided his spell practice. It was no surprise he mastered the Ice Needle Technique so quickly.  

And as the strongest mid-tier technique, the Ice Needle Technique lived up to its reputation. On the day he succeeded, Lin Xuan returned to the hidden valley only he knew of to test its power.  

He selected a massive boulder weighing over a thousand pounds as his target. Channeling his spiritual power, he extended his right hand. With a sharp hiss, white mist swirled above his palm, coalescing into hundreds of crystalline ice needles.  

With a flick of his wrist, the needles shot toward the boulder like lightning. Amidst flashes of cold light, the sturdy rock was riddled with holes, reduced to a sieve.

Lin Xuan nodded in satisfaction. Then, casting a low-tier Strength Enhancement spell on himself, he pushed the boulder off the cliff. Though the valley was secluded and no one would trace the ice needle marks back to him, Lin Xuan was meticulous by nature—he preferred leaving no traces at all. Tossing the boulder into the abyss ensured absolute secrecy.  

With that done, he assessed his Ice Needle Technique. Truthfully, as the instructor had described, controlling a hundred needles at once was only minor success. When perfected, the technique supposedly allowed control of nearly a thousand needles at once, creating an overwhelming, unstoppable barrage.  

Though he yearned for such mastery, Lin Xuan was no dreamer. At the Agile Pulse stage, reaching the pinnacle of the Ice Needle Technique was impossible. Even so, his current hundred-needle volley already rivaled some high-tier spells.  

One should always strive for improvement but remain grounded. As things stood, he had already achieved his goal.
