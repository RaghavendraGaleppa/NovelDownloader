**Chapter 37: Sophistry!**

Just as Zhou Tian drooled over the food, wondering why Emperor Qin still sat at the head table without signaling for the feast to begin, another announcement came from outside.

"The Tool Nation—has arrived!"

Another group of people entered through the palace gates. This group was more technologically advanced, clad in blue, form-fitting battle armor with a distinctly mechanical feel. Leading them was a general-like figure, his shoulders adorned with various medals, a resolute, square-jawed face, and a calm demeanor.

General Zhen Dong stepped forward to greet them, following the same routine as before. Such procedures were quite dull. Zhou Tian found himself growing drowsy. Tian Ling, still fiddling with the Ink Jade Qilin in her arms, wasn't playing with him either.

"It's very boring, isn't it?"

A male voice beside him startled Zhou Tian, who was on the verge of falling asleep. He turned to see who it was and his body tensed.

"Big Brother, Second Brother!"

It was Zhou Yu who had arrived, with Zhou Ying following behind him.

"The last time I saw you, you were just a small child. Now you've grown so tall," Zhou Yu said with a faint smile.

Tian Ling also reacted, nervously bowing. "Big Brother, Second Brother!"

"No need to be so formal, we are family," Zhou Yu said.

"Do you like this Ink Jade Qilin? If you do, I'll give it to you," Zhou Ying said to Tian Ling.

Before Tian Ling could reply, the Ink Jade Qilin in her arms leaped back onto Zhou Ying's shoulder, rubbing its head against Zhou Ying's neck with all its might, its adorable big eyes almost shedding tears. Zhou Ying, however, ignored it, looking only at Tian Ling, as if the moment Tian Ling said "yes," the Qilin would be hers.

"I... I'd rather not..." Tian Ling bit her lower lip. Although she desperately wanted it, seeing the plea in the Ink Jade Qilin's eyes melted her heart, and she couldn't bring herself to say "yes."

The Ink Jade Qilin let out a human-like sigh of relief and plopped down on Zhou Ying's shoulder.

"I'll catch you one even cuter than this in the future!" Zhou Tian said, seeing Tian Ling's reluctance.

"You've made me out to be the bad guy," Zhou Ying shook her head and smiled at the scene. She pulled a pale-green longsword from thin air and handed it to Tian Ling. "This is a sword I obtained by chance; I don't even know its name. I didn't bring much else this time, so consider this a welcoming gift."

The longsword was not forged from ordinary materials. Its blade was semi-transparent, with swirling wisps of ethereal energy flowing within it. Although Zhou Ying spoke of it casually, the powerful aura it emitted was undeniable.

Tian Ling looked at Zhou Tian, unsure whether she should accept it.

"Why look at him? This is my welcoming gift for my sister-in-law. Would he dare stop you from taking it?" Zhou Ying teased.

Zhou Tian nodded, signaling Tian Ling to accept it. Welcoming gifts were perfectly normal. Tian Ling thanked Zhou Ying, took the longsword, and with a flash of green light, the sword vanished. A sword-shaped mark appeared on her wrist, indicating it had already recognized her as its master. Zhou Ying nodded in satisfaction, while Tian Ling's face was filled with astonishment. Only Holy Weapons could automatically recognize their masters.

"I returned in a hurry and didn't have time to carefully choose a gift. Take this thing," Zhou Yu also pulled an item from thin air and handed it to Tian Ling.

It was a purple silk ribbon, like a tassel, emitting a faint glow. Like the sword, it automatically recognized its master, transforming into an imprint on her wrist. Tian Ling's astonishment deepened.

"Saint... King..." The feedback from the ribbon let her know that this item was actually a Saint King-grade treasure.

"Haha, Big Brother is truly Big Brother! His generosity is immense!" Zhou Ying laughed.

"This item is feminine, and I have no use for it; it would just sit around. However, Tian Ling, you must remember that you cannot activate this item yet," Zhou Yu said calmly.

"Understood," Tian Ling nodded.

"Alright, we should go now. We'll talk more once we're home!" Zhou Ying said. Today, only the Grand Luo Temple and the Tool Nation, these two major powers, had arrived. After the tedious procedures, the banquet was about to begin, but they couldn't participate just yet. There were many matters to report to Emperor Qin. The officials and Emperor Qin were already preparing to leave, and they needed to follow.

Emperor Qin, along with a group of ministers and the people who had returned today, departed. Scholar Li from Grand Luo Academy and the general from the Tool Nation also left; after all, their age and status made it inappropriate for them to stay there.

As soon as the important figures left, the students from Grand Luo Academy approached Zhou Tian. One of them, who appeared to be quite influential, asked Zhou Tian with a grim expression, "Was it you who just said we were simpletons?"

Zhou Tian looked up. "No."

"Hmph, bold enough to say it, but not bold enough to admit it?" the man sneered.

"No, what I said was you were *utterly* simpletons, not just simpletons!" Zhou Tian retorted.

"Is there a difference between the two?" the man asked coldly.

"No!" Zhou Tian replied frankly.

"You... you're just arguing semantics!" the man said, exasperated.

"I know you," another person stepped forward, a look of schadenfreude on his face. "The Qin King's Heir of the Heavenly Qin Dynasty, and also a cripple who cannot cultivate!"

The air grew silent. Zhou Zui's face darkened, and golden flames ignited in Liu Yan's eyes, devoid of any warmth, yet striking fear into others. The Third Prince narrowed his eyes, and behind his back, he conjured several runes in the air. In unseen areas of the palace, several dark figures began to move towards them. "The Qin King's Heir has been insulted!" Hmm, this reason is good enough to kill a few people!

The others also moved closer, their auras powerful. This was no longer just about one person. What were these few people? How dare they speak like that? Did they really think Grand Luo Academy would go to war with the Heavenly Qin Empire over their deaths?

"Oh." Zhou Tian's expression remained normal, showing no sign of abnormality.

"Oh?" What kind of reaction is that? Where's the pain? The sadness? The person who spoke looked disappointed.

Then Zhou Tian said, "I need to correct you on one thing. I am a mortal who cannot cultivate, not a cripple who cannot cultivate!"

"There's no difference between the two!" the first man said.

"No, no, there is a difference!" Zhou Tian slowly explained. "Being able to cultivate doesn't mean you're not a cripple. For example, you, dressed immaculately, but your heart is dark. For instance, right now you're probably thinking that Zhou Tian only has a good family background, and if you had such a good background, you'd definitely be more outstanding than me!"

As a seasoned keyboard warrior, Zhou Tian was well-versed in the art of shifting concepts. The man's thoughts were, in fact, the thoughts of most people, and they weren't particularly dark, nor did they have anything to do with whether that person was a cripple.

"But someone who cannot cultivate is definitely a cripple!" the man retorted, enraged.

Nice!

In truth, those words above, with a little thought, would be seen as utterly illogical. But Zhou Tian had left a trap in his very first sentence, one that required no thought at all to fall into.

Sure enough, the little bunny took the bait!

"Good, then I ask you..." Zhou Tian walked up to him and looked at him.
