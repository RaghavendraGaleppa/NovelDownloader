# Chapter 157: News

Upon hearing He Chuan's words and considering his recent assignment to repair formations at Seven Stars Island, Li Shiming realized the sect's movements weren't baseless—something significant was indeed happening.

"Senior Brother, with the might of our Seven Sects, do we still need to worry about external enemies?" Li Shiming probed intentionally.

"I don't know the specifics, but judging by how the sect keeps recalling disciples stationed outside, whatever enemy we're facing must be extremely troublesome!" He Chuan shook his head in reply.

As he spoke, a trace of concern surfaced on his face. For cultivators like them, the sect was their foundation, their home, their sanctuary—the very basis of their existence. Even someone as talented as He Chuan would struggle to progress smoothly on the path of cultivation without the sect's support.

Li Shiming hadn't been aware of the recall order, which spoke to the limitations of his social circle.

Preoccupied with these thoughts, He Chuan lost interest in further conversation.

Over the next twenty days, the two worked together. Li Shiming accelerated his pace, finally completing the task of setting up one hundred formations. True to his routine, he returned to the sect daily—a habit He Chuan didn't question, as his own mission was simply to protect Li Shiming, not oversee his activities.

"Junior Brother, once I reach Foundation Establishment, I'll definitely ask for your help in setting up formations for my cave abode!" Though not well-versed in formations, He Chuan recognized Li Shiming's profound expertise. As they prepared to return to the sect after completing their mission, he extended this early invitation.

He understood the sect's current situation clearly. Formation masters were in critically short supply. Even if he became a Foundation Establishment cultivator, securing a high-level formation master to arrange his cave's formations would be impossible. Currently, the sect only had two high-level formation masters, both barely managing to maintain the sect's grand formation.

As for intermediate formation masters, their skill levels varied greatly. The most outstanding was Yin Shilan, but the cost of enlisting her services would be exorbitant.

"Just say the word, Senior Brother, and I'll come," Li Shiming readily agreed.

"The sect won't let me cultivate too quickly, otherwise I would've broken through already!" He Chuan lamented.

Li Shiming was unfamiliar with how the sect nurtured genius cultivators, as they followed a specialized process.

"Isn't the standard to attempt breakthrough upon reaching peak Qi Refinement?" Li Shiming asked curiously. He would soon face his own Foundation Establishment breakthrough and wanted to learn more.

"Ordinary peak Qi Refinement cultivators haven't achieved perfect unity in their spiritual energy. Ideally, one should compress their spiritual energy to the absolute limit—where not a single strand more can be contained—before breaking through. This creates the best foundation for Foundation Establishment," He Chuan explained frankly.

---

Li Shiming had some theories about this, particularly regarding his avatar, Baili Jinyan, who was in such a state. The spiritual energy within the avatar had reached a point where Li Shiming dared not cultivate further, as any additional energy might trigger an immediate breakthrough.

"Is there no way to accelerate this process besides slow tempering over time?" Li Shiming pressed. With his avatar's assistance, he would reach peak Qi Refinement soon. But achieving the same density of spiritual energy as his avatar would take considerably longer.

"Of course there are methods. Certain rare herbs can condense spiritual energy and shorten the tempering period. Also, the sect's Foundation Establishment techniques include a spiritual sense secret art called the 'Hundred Revolutions Spirit Condensation Method' that can accelerate the process—but it requires spiritual sense, which is a hundred times harder to achieve than condensing spiritual energy!" He Chuan, clearly aiming to cultivate Li Shiming's friendship, answered all questions thoroughly.

Their conversation continued until they returned to the sect, with He Chuan sharing insights about the training of elite disciples.

After parting ways—He Chuan to submit their completed mission and Li Shiming to collect his rewards at the Spiritual Mechanism Pavilion—Li Shiming entered the pavilion and once again felt that brief, unsettling sensation.

Elder Song was present as usual, offering a slight nod when Li Shiming entered. Occupied with controlling the sect's grand formation, the elder didn't speak, leaving Li Shiming to wait quietly. Though the Spiritual Mechanism Pavilion appeared to be just one of many sect buildings, it housed a core node of the grand formation, granting Elder Song control over the entire network.

With his advanced understanding of formations, Li Shiming could discern some of Elder Song's operations. He wasn't the only formation master sent out—several intermediate-level masters had accepted assignments, though his workload had been the heaviest. Now, Elder Song was connecting and inspecting the formations Li Shiming had completed.

"Li Shiming, you've performed well. I'll deduct all your merit points. Go collect your Foundation Establishment Pill," Elder Song said indifferently after finding no issues.

"Yes, Elder Song," Li Shiming replied with a bow.

"I hope your luck holds this time as well," Elder Song murmured expressionlessly as Li Shiming departed.

Acquiring the pill proved straightforward. As a formation master redeeming merit points, no faction within the sect would challenge his claim, even with only three pills remaining. Elder Song didn't interfere, allowing Li Shiming to obtain his sixth Foundation Establishment Pill—double the minimum typically allotted to triple-spiritual root cultivators.

Just as Li Shiming prepared to return to his cave, his identity jade transmitted a summons to Tianhai Hall on Central Peak. As a sect disciple, he had to comply immediately.

At Tianhai Hall, an attendant guided him to the sect leader's office. Instead of Sect Leader Yu sitting behind the large desk as usual, a female cultivator occupied the seat while the sect leader stood nearby. Two other cultivators—one being He Chuan—stood in the center of the room.

"Shiming's here! Come greet Elder Sheng quickly!" Sect Leader Yu beckoned with a smile.

Startled, Li Shiming hurried forward to pay his respects. Elder Sheng was the only female Golden Core elder in the sect and the third such elder Li Shiming had met.

"Li Shiming, stand with those two," Elder Sheng instructed, pointing to the center.

Exchanging a questioning glance with He Chuan—who shook his head to indicate he was equally clueless—Li Shiming noticed the other cultivator shared He Chuan's exceptional strength, marking them as another elite disciple. He couldn't fathom why the sect would group him, a formation master, with two combat-focused geniuses.

"A battle at Qi Refinement level will occur at Seven Stars Island—our seven sects against external forces. Though only Qi Refinement cultivators will participate, this is a battle of honor we must win to crush the outsiders' arrogance! Shang Haoquan and He Chuan are assigned by the sect. As for you, Li Shiming..." Elder Sheng's expression turned rueful. "You killed Du Bingyan of Sacred Ice Sect. They've rallied other sects to demand your participation."

Li Shiming knew nothing about Seven Stars Island's current situation but guessed conflicts were escalating. He had no desire to be drawn into what was essentially a Golden Core-level confrontation where a mere Qi Refinement cultivator like himself would be obliterated by the slightest ripple.

"Don't worry. This battle permits any means necessary. You can prepare formations for defense and support Shang Haoquan and He Chuan," Elder Sheng reassured, though her words only heightened Li Shiming's concerns. If "any means" were allowed, so were his opponents'.

After dismissing them to make requests through Sect Leader Yu for their mission to Seven Stars Island, Li Shiming immediately voiced his needs.

"Sect Leader, as a support cultivator fighting for the sect, I'll require resources," he said gravely. Shang Haoquan and He Chuan exchanged glances—they knew Li Shiming had single-handedly eliminated Du Bingyan's six-strong late-Qi Refinement team, earning his place in this battle through combat prowess, not support skills.

"Elder Sheng has authorized full access to the sect's storage for mission needs," Sect Leader Yu declared grandly, under orders to prioritize their safety. Shang Haoquan and He Chuan were elite disciples, while Li Shiming had connections to Elder Yin—all irreplaceable assets.

Without hesitation, Li Shiming listed rare second-grade formation materials for a Five Elements formation—partly for battle, but mostly to test a theory from the "Five Elements Absorption Art" about enhancing breakthrough chances through external elemental forces. When Sect Leader Yu questioned his intentions, Li Shiming bluffed about long-planned combat tactics.

After negotiating to "borrow" the materials and the "Hundred Revolutions Spirit Condensation Method"—with an exaggerated display of reluctance from Sect Leader Yu that everyone recognized as tacit approval—Li Shiming secured everything he needed. The sect leader's stern questioning of the other two disciples' requests contrasted sharply with his indulgence toward Li Shiming, highlighting the unspoken favoritism at play.
