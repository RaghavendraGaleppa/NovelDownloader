# Chapter 82: True Disciple's Guarantee, Yan Luohe

“Yes, Elder, this Eight-Profound City Lord is actually a clone of the Demonic Sect’s Daozi, Di Xuanza. He cultivates the *Heavenly Demon's Deviant Heart Divine Art*, so it’s likely this was his weakest clone,” the white-haired elder explained.

The Examiner Elder’s expression suddenly turned serious. “How could the Eight-Profound City Lord be a Demonic Sect Daozi’s clone? Such a figure, even a mere clone, would be nearly invincible among those of the same cultivation level. How could a few of you possibly deal with him? Do not lie.”

Though he spoke thus, at his level of cultivation, a strange glint still appeared in his eyes as he gazed at the eight corpses on the ground.

An elder, a child, a youth, a robust man, an old woman, a beautiful lady—eight individuals of different ages, representing eight different personalities. This indeed seemed to align perfectly with the legendary *Heavenly Demon's Deviant Heart Divine Art* cultivated by the Demonic Sect’s Daozi, Di Xuanza, who was known to favor these eight archetypes.

Seeing that the Examiner Elder did not immediately deny it but instead fell into contemplation, the white-haired elder continued, “Elder, it would indeed be difficult for us to kill him with our capabilities.”

“However, this Daoist Yang by my side is a genius. He has already perfected the Four Forms of Gui Zang Sword Art and Zhou Tian Displacement.”

“With him as the main force, supplemented by this Junior Sister, we were able to slay him. For this, we even paid the price of severe injuries.” The white-haired elder looked at Yang Ji, then pointed to the strong-suited girl.

Upon hearing that two great divine arts had been perfected, the Examiner Elder immediately became serious. With a surprised expression, he scrutinized Yang Ji. “When I just checked your cultivation, I found that you only possess medium aptitude and have cultivated for no more than a hundred years. Have you truly cultivated both of these great divine arts to the perfected realm?”

To perfect two great divine arts within a hundred years—such comprehension was considered exceptionally outstanding even within the Boundless Dao Sect, comparable to geniuses possessing a Saint Body. Such a genius had a high probability of becoming a True Disciple, a status far beyond that of an ordinary elder like himself. He immediately adopted an extremely solemn demeanor and said to Yang Ji, “Can you demonstrate your arts for me now?”

“I can,” Yang Ji nodded. He instantly activated the Heavenly Momentum and unleashed Zhou Tian Displacement. Immediately, the hall was filled with afterimages that remained vivid and did not disperse. The Examiner Elder stared intently at Yang Ji, yet it seemed as though his figure had not moved. Only when the entire hall was filled with his illusory images did Yang Ji still stand upright before him. The Examiner Elder was deeply moved, realizing that Yang Ji’s speed was simply too fast; in a brief instant, he had displaced himself thousands of times and returned to his original spot, which made it seem as if he hadn’t moved at all.

“Your Zhou Tian Displacement has indeed reached perfection,” the Examiner Elder took a deep breath. “Now let me see your Gui Zang Sword Art.”

Yang Ji nodded. With an open palm, the Xun Sword Soul, Li Sword Soul, Zhen Sword Soul, and Dui Sword Soul—four solidified sword souls—appeared side by side in his palm.

“These are perfected sword souls!” Before the Elder could calm his emotions, Yang Ji rotated his palm, and the four sword souls instantly merged, forming a single sword soul. The moment this sword soul appeared, sword qi surged skyward, and sword intent soared, causing the surrounding air to transform into whistling flying swords, making one feel as if they were in a world of swords.

“This is a Sword Domain! You’ve actually reached this stage,” the Examiner Elder exclaimed in astonishment.

One step further than a Sword Domain was a Nascent World, a realm only reachable by Soul Transformation cultivators. A Nascent World formed purely from these four sword domains would be enough to surpass sixty percent of the sect’s disciples, not to mention that the path of such a genius would not stop here. He never expected to encounter such a genius in this place.

He was now eighty percent convinced that Yang Ji had indeed slain the Demonic Sect Daozi’s clone, though two tenths of doubt still lingered.

“Did you truly slay the Demonic Sect Daozi’s clone?” the Examiner Elder looked up at Yang Ji, confirming again.

“I can testify. In fact, I was defeated by the Demonic Sect Daozi early on. It was this Daoist friend who single-handedly slew the Demonic Sect Daozi,” the strong-suited girl suddenly interjected.

“Is that true?” the Examiner Elder looked at her. This was a Spirit Body, and her words were enough to command his attention. With two geniuses appearing at once, he proceeded with even greater caution, daring not to be careless.

“I can confirm it! Furthermore, I can use the name of the Luohe Heavenly Domain True Disciple as a guarantee to ensure the truth of this matter. If the Elder does not believe it, you may petition the sect’s high-ranking members to use an immortal artifact to rewind fragments of time and investigate the incident,” the strong-suited girl stated with conviction.

“Luohe Heavenly Domain True Disciple? Who is True Disciple Yan Luohe to you? And by what right do you use her name as a guarantee?” the Examiner Elder asked sternly.

“She’s my sister!” the strong-suited girl suddenly declared.

“True Disciple Yan Luohe is your sister?” the Examiner Elder’s expression subtly shifted upon hearing this.

“Precisely,” the strong-suited girl nodded.

“True Disciple Luohe is actually her sister?” The white-haired elder and the others were all inwardly astonished upon hearing this. Even Yang Ji glanced at her with a hint of surprise. Using a True Disciple’s name to guarantee his statement was truly a significant favor.

“But words alone are not proof. How can you confirm True Disciple Luohe is your sister?” the Examiner Elder pressed.

“I have the True Disciple Token as proof. The holder of this token acts as the True Disciple,” the strong-suited girl swept her hand back, producing a mysterious token. The Examiner Elder took it, and seeing the two characters “洛河” (Luohe) inscribed on the token, he immediately gave the strong-suited girl a long, scrutinizing look. Everyone present knew the token was genuine.

“Every True Disciple possesses only one identity token. The characters ‘Luohe’ are inscribed by the Sect Master using our sect’s immortal art, so they cannot be faked. Since you hold True Disciple Luohe’s token, I suppose what you say is true.” The Examiner Elder handed the token back, confirming, “Do you truly wish to use True Disciple Luohe’s name to guarantee this matter?”

“This matter is true, so guaranteeing it is no problem. If the Elder does not believe it, you may petition the sect’s high-ranking members to use an immortal artifact to rewind time and investigate the truth of this matter,” the strong-suited girl said.

“This matter is not serious enough to alarm the sect’s high-ranking members. A True Disciple’s guarantee is sufficient. I suppose True Disciple Luohe entrusting her token to you means you can represent her intentions.” The Examiner Elder looked at Yang Ji and the strong-suited girl with a serious expression. “I will ask you one last time: is slaying the Demonic Sect Daozi’s clone truly what happened?”

“It is!” Yang Ji and the strong-suited girl exchanged glances and nodded.

“Very well, I will make a record then.” The Examiner Elder then used his unique Dao power to write on Yang Ji’s Dao Sect Token: [Main force in slaying Demonic Sect Daozi Di Xuanza’s clone], and on the strong-suited girl’s Dao Sect Token: [Auxiliary in slaying Demonic Sect Daozi Di Xuanza’s clone].

Seeing this, the strong-suited girl looked like she wanted to speak, but in the end, she allowed him to write it down. After a brief thought, she understood that the Examiner Elder was adding a contribution for her, likely to involve her sister. If the matter was true, there would be no issue; if it were false, a True Disciple would share the responsibility.

After writing, the Examiner Elder cautiously asked Yang Ji to demonstrate his arts once more, recording it in the form of a recorded image and transferring it into Yang Ji’s Dao Sect Token as proof. With this, the assessment was completely finished.

“I have recorded your assessment history on your token. I am merely an Outer Sect Elder, and my authority is limited, so I cannot bestow any rewards upon you. However, if you can pass the second, or even third, assessment and come into contact with Inner Sect Elders, then this experience of slaying the Demonic Sect Daozi’s clone might become a great opportunity for you,” the Examiner Elder said calmly.

“Thank you, Elder, this disciple understands,” Yang Ji bowed respectfully.
