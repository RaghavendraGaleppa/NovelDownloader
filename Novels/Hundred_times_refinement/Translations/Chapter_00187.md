# Chapter 135: Spirit-Restoring Pill  

"Hmph! The legendary Fairy Ouyang is nothing special after all!"  

A trace of murderous intent flashed in Miao Ai Shangren's eyes. It seemed the rumors had exaggerated this female cultivator's strength. Even without the formation, he could capture her alive.  

Watching this scene, Lin Xuan appeared unperturbed, merely retreating another twenty to thirty zhang away.  

Ouyang Qinxin's delicate face grew colder. After such a long delay, Taibai Sword Immortal still hadn't appeared. It was clear she had indeed fallen into a trap.  

Seeing that her golden needles were ineffective, Ouyang Qinxin changed her finger technique. The music from her zither grew more intense, and a golden orb of light appeared in the sky, growing brighter until it transformed into a massive, peculiar bird.  

Resembling a crane, its wingspan stretched dozens of zhang, with only a single leg.  

**Bifang!**  

Even someone as composed as Lin Xuan couldn't help but be astonished. This was the legendary Fire Divine Bird!  

Of course, this wasn't the real Bifang but an illusion conjured by Ouyang Qinxin's spiritual power through her soundwave technique.  

Miao Ai Shangren was equally shocked, his earlier nonchalance vanishing. He muttered a curse before spitting out a dark green orb from his mouth.  

The orb merged into the black mist of his magic treasure, immediately triggering thunderous roars. The mist churned violently, and moments later, a dragon's roar erupted from within.  

The mist dispersed, revealing a ferocious flood dragon.  

The flood dragon, like the Bifang, was an ancient divine beast, second only to the true dragon.  

Miao Ai Shangren was using the **Transformation Technique**, a secret art only available to Core Formation experts.  

By transforming his magic treasure into a flood dragon, it not only resembled the divine beast but also possessed some of its abilities.  

Naturally, this technique consumed an immense amount of spiritual power.  

The flood dragon belonged to water, while the Bifang belonged to fire.  

A sinister glint flashed in Miao Ai Shangren's eyes as he directed the flood dragon to charge forward with a roar under his divine sense.  

Ouyang Qinxin plucked her zither strings, and the Bifang flapped its wings, igniting a sea of flames in the sky to meet the attack.  

For a time, flames and water vapor clashed violently. Lin Xuan watched the battle between the divine beasts in awe. Though they were merely illusions formed by spiritual power, their might was truly earth-shaking.  

Seeing he couldn't gain the upper hand, Miao Ai Shangren hesitated briefly before spitting out a small black arrow, which shot toward Ouyang Qinxin like a streak of dark light.  

**A second magic treasure!**  

Lin Xuan was surprised. Unlike Foundation Establishment or Qi Condensation cultivators, who often wielded multiple spiritual tools, Core Formation cultivators typically possessed only one magic treasure.  

The reason was simple: materials for crafting magic treasures were exceedingly rare. Most Core Formation cultivators spent decades gathering enough for just one. Few had the resources to create a second.  

This demonic cultivator was truly wealthy.  

Yet Ouyang Qinxin was no ordinary opponent either. Without a trace of fear, she flipped her left hand, revealing a dagger.  

It transformed into a golden streak, intertwining with the black arrow's dark light in a fierce struggle.  

The two were evenly matched, neither gaining an advantage. Miao Ai Shangren's face twisted in disbelief. The **Yin Cold Arrow** wasn't his original magic treasure but a reward from the Extreme Demon Sovereign for a great merit. Its power far surpassed ordinary magic treasures.  

Though he hadn't fully refined it and forcing its use would damage his vitality, its power shouldn't have diminished. Yet Ouyang Qinxin had effortlessly countered it.  

Truly, reputation wasn't earned for nothing. Despite being only at the early Core Formation stage, she could hold her own against him, a mid-stage Core Formation demonic cultivator.  

As shock filled Miao Ai Shangren, his gaze toward Lin Xuan grew venomous. If not for this brat ruining his plans and trapping Ouyang Qinxin in the Bone Yin Formation...  

Being stared at by a Core Formation cultivator sent a chill down Lin Xuan's spine, but he remained calm. With Ouyang Qinxin present, the enemy wouldn't have the leisure to deal with him.  

Lin Xuan maintained his composure, secretly gripping the **Jade Snow Ring**. He wouldn't recklessly engage a Core Formation cultivator as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but if an opportunity for a sneak attack arose, he wouldn't hesitate.  

Now, he and Ouyang Qinxin were on the same boat. If she fell, his fate would be dire.  

With this in mind, Lin Xuan's eyes flickered with contemplation.  

---  

Lightning flashed, and multicolored beams streaked across the sky. A day and night passed as the two Core Formation experts battled. Both Ouyang Qinxin and Miao Ai Shangren looked pale, alternating between attacking with their magic treasures and replenishing their spiritual power with spirit stones.  

Seeing this, Lin Xuan smiled faintly. He discreetly reached into his robe and retrieved a snow-white pill.  

While Miao Ai Shangren was distracted, Lin Xuan sent a wisp of divine sense to deliver the **Spirit-Restoring Pill** to Ouyang Qinxin, whispering, "Fairy Ouyang, take this pill. It will quickly restore your spiritual power."  

Lin Xuan's claim was slightly exaggerated, but the pill's replenishment speed was indeed over ten times faster than spirit stones. After a brief hesitation, Ouyang Qinxin swallowed it, reasoning that since he had saved her once before, he likely meant no harm.  

Several hours later...  

---  

Miao Ai Shangren's expression grew increasingly grim. His spiritual power was nearly exhausted, yet Ouyang Qinxin seemed more energetic than before.  

How was this possible?  

Legends spoke of ancient pills capable of rapidly restoring spiritual power. Could she possess such a treasure?  

Fear gripped him as Ouyang Qinxin's attacks intensified. Miao Ai Shangren began considering retreat.  

With his last reserves of spiritual power, he fought desperately, forcing Ouyang Qinxin back before recalling his magic treasure and fleeing as a streak of light.  

"Trying to escape? Too late!"  

Ouyang Qinxin snorted coldly. She wouldn't let him get away. The Bifang, formed from her spiritual power, gave chase.  

Miao Ai Shangren glanced back, gritted his teeth, and discarded his magic treasure, transforming it into the flood dragon to block the Bifang. Without hesitation, he abandoned his treasure—a true act of cutting losses to save himself.  

Yet he soon found Lin Xuan blocking his path.  

The youth who had ruined his plans glared at him with venom, but Lin Xuan struck first.  

With a flick of his wrist, over a dozen mid-grade talismans activated.  

Firebirds, heavenly thunder, and ice needles surged forth...  

Miao Ai Shangren was both shocked and furious. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn't have feared such attacks, but now, nearing exhaustion and with Ouyang Qinxin closing in, he couldn't afford to waste time.  

Just as he tried to flee, brilliant light flashed as Lin Xuan unleashed two beast talismans.  

"Go!"  

Lin Xuan pointed at him, and the Sky-Soaring Bird and Flame Rhinoceros spirits fearlessly charged.  

At the same time, Lin Xuan gripped the strange dagger—a top-grade spiritual tool with nearly a third of a magic treasure's power.  

Miao Ai Shangren's face darkened as he summoned a ghastly claw from the void. Lin Xuan remained calm, knowing he only needed to buy a little time. Channeling his spiritual power, the dagger shot forth as a dark streak, clashing with the claw.  

A violent tremor ran through Lin Xuan's body, and a metallic taste filled his mouth. He was stunned—even at death's door, a Core Formation cultivator's strength was formidable.  

Miao Ai Shangren's eyes lit up with malice, eager to vent his rage by killing the boy. But before he could act, a sharp cry rang out:  

"How dare you!"  

A blue radiance—Ouyang Qinxin had caught up. Terrified, Miao Ai Shangren abandoned his revenge and fled.  

But escape wasn't so easy. If he got away, Ouyang Qinxin might be unharmed, but Lin Xuan would face endless trouble.  

Suppressing his surging blood, Lin Xuan formed a hand seal, directing the Sky-Soaring Bird and Flame Rhinoceros to block Miao Ai Shangren's path.  

Before the demonic cultivator could react, a golden streak pierced his chest.  

Blood sprayed as the golden dagger revealed itself—Ouyang Qinxin's weapon.  

With a look of hatred and unwillingness, Miao Ai Shangren's core shattered, and he fell.  

Lin Xuan exhaled in relief. Without Miao Ai Shangren's spiritual power, the flood dragon reverted to its original form—a flying sword shaped like a dragon. Ouyang Qinxin retrieved it with a wave of her hand.  

Meanwhile, Lin Xuan summoned a white light from his sleeve to seize the storage pouch. When he looked up, his eyes met Ouyang Qinxin's.  

"Thank you for your assistance, Fellow Daoist. Ouyang Qinxin is deeply grateful. May I know your esteemed name?"  

"You flatter me, Fairy. I am Lin Xuan of the Spirit Medicine Mountain, at your service."  

"Lin Xuan? The young master of Spirit Medicine Mountain?"  

Lin Xuan was surprised she knew of him.  

Ouyang Qinxin's smile deepened. Had it not been for Lin Xuan, she would have surely perished in Miao Ai Shangren's formation. Filled with gratitude, she said warmly, "Young Master, there's no need for formalities. If you don't mind, let us address each other as peers."
