# Chapter 30: Industrial Zone

During the clan meeting.

Chen Zhi was drenched in sweat. He realized that compared to the old clan leader who rarely involved himself in mundane affairs, the young clan leader Chen Daoxuan exerted even greater pressure on him.

At the very least, when managing clan affairs, the old clan leader wouldn't scrutinize every detail. Issues like the population structure of mortals or the distribution of fertile land within the clan were matters Chen Xianhe never concerned himself with.

In Chen Xianhe's eyes, the most important goal for the Chen Clan of Twin Lakes Island was to nurture their own spiritual vein. Only then could the Chen Clan freely nurture younger generations and expand their group of cultivators. Otherwise, even if they discovered descendants with spiritual roots, the Chen Clan wouldn't be able to set them on the path of cultivation.

Currently, the clan only had one spiritual spring, which was insufficient to support more cultivators. Among the Chen Clan's three thousand members, based on the probability of mortals possessing spiritual roots, roughly one in a hundred would have them. This meant there were likely over thirty potential cultivators hidden within the current Chen Clan, yet they had no access to spiritual energy to begin cultivation.

Even if they were forcibly set on the path of cultivation, these individuals would ultimately have no choice but to leave the clan and become rogue cultivators.

After a long silence, Chen Daoxuan spoke: "Three matters."

He raised three fingers. "First, order the county office to immediately conduct a detailed survey of the clan's population structure. I want to know the number of children under ten years old, the number of young adults between ten and forty, middle-aged and elderly between forty and sixty, and the elderly population over sixty. Additionally, investigate how many married couples are of childbearing age and how many unmarried men there are—all must be thoroughly documented."

Chen Zhi nodded repeatedly in response.

"Second, who is responsible for public construction projects in Changping County?"

"Reporting to the young clan leader, this humble official serves as the Construction Officer in charge of civil engineering projects in Changping County," an elderly man nearing sixty years old tremblingly stepped forward from behind Chen Zhi, speaking nervously.

"Good. Take note—starting today, survey the total land area of Twin Lakes Island, along with the approximate distribution of freshwater resources and mineral deposits. Prepare a detailed map and submit it."

"Your subordinate obeys!" The old man bowed before retreating.

"As for the third matter..." Chen Daoxuan glanced at the Construction Officer who was about to withdraw, "This still concerns your responsibilities!"

The old man, who had just begun to retreat, immediately halted and stepped forward again, bowing in acknowledgment.

"How many craftsmen does the clan currently have in total?"

"Reporting to the young clan leader, the clan currently has 271 craftsmen of various types. Among them, 184 are construction craftsmen, 26 are carpenters, 41 are blacksmiths, and the remaining 20 are miscellaneous craftsmen."

When it came to the clan's craftsmen, the elderly Construction Officer recited the numbers fluently.

Hearing there were 184 construction craftsmen, Chen Daoxuan's expression finally improved slightly.

"Good. The third matter is that the clan will establish an industrial zone."

Chen Daoxuan had conceived the idea of an industrial zone on Twin Lakes Island as early as five years ago. However, back then, the Spirit Fusion Furnace had not yet been developed. Moreover, the primary force in this world was cultivators, and Chen Daoxuan couldn't abandon the fundamentals to gradually industrialize the Chen Clan starting from steam engines. Even if he could achieve industrialization similar to his previous life, it would likely take several hundred years—by which time, Chen Daoxuan, having devoted himself entirely to this endeavor, would have long perished, leaving him no energy or time for cultivation.

He hadn't forgotten what was most fundamental to him. The reason Chen Daoxuan sought to strengthen and expand the clan, aside from inheriting the aspirations of his ancestors, was to secure the necessary resources for his cultivation.

As everyone knew, the further a cultivator progressed in their cultivation, the more resources they would require. Wealth, companions, techniques, and land—all boiled down to one word: resources.

"Industrial zone?" The old Construction Officer was stunned—another term he had never heard before.

Chen Daoxuan couldn't explain what an industrial zone was to him, so he simply outlined the land requirements for the industrial zone.

As a transmigrator, Chen Daoxuan understood that establishing an industrial zone was no simple matter. It required various conditions to be met.

First, an industrial zone needed a leading industry to drive other upstream and downstream industries within the zone, forming a complete industrial chain. This condition was something Chen Daoxuan could fulfill—the upcoming artifact factory would serve as this leading industry.

Beyond the leading industry, establishing an industrial zone also required policy support. For Chen Daoxuan, who held absolute authority, this wasn't an issue either.

As for the remaining requirements—industrial land, a comprehensive social service system, and factory construction—these were also manageable for the Chen Clan, which could concentrate all its resources.

The only remaining problem was that the Chen Clan lacked qualified industrial workers!

Although the planned artifact factory would initially be a small workshop, Chen Daoxuan estimated that he would need at least twelve to fifteen skilled Spirit Fusion Furnace operators to cooperate with him to maximize production efficiency.

Thinking of this, Chen Daoxuan waved his hand and said, "Construction Officer Chen and Chen Liangyu will stay. The rest may leave."

The attendees glanced at Chen Daoxuan, exchanged looks with one another, and said, "Young Clan Leader, we take our leave."

Once everyone had departed, only Chen Daoxuan, Chen Liangyu, and the elderly Construction Officer remained in the ancestral hall's meeting room.

Chen Daoxuan flipped through the county officials' roster and found the old Construction Officer's name—Chen Beiwang.

Chen Liangyu, as the overseer of the copper mine, was the clan member most familiar with Chen Daoxuan. Not only had Chen Daoxuan inspected the mine's output annually, but he had also frequently visited to "borrow" copper ore when he ran short while crafting artifacts. Over time, the two had become relatively acquainted—though this familiarity was one-sided on Chen Liangyu's part.

In Chen Daoxuan's mind, the mine overseer was no different from other clan members. However, with the recent exhaustive mining of the copper vein, the mine had been depleted. Chen Liangyu, as the overseer, had lost his former status. Though he still stood alongside County Magistrate Chen Zhi during clan meetings, Chen Liangyu knew that without his position as mine overseer, he could no longer compare to Chen Zhi.

Chen Daoxuan paid no attention to Chen Liangyu's thoughts and instead turned his gaze to Chen Beiwang.

"Construction Officer Chen, did you understand the industrial zone site selection I mentioned earlier?"

"This subordinate understood." The gray-haired Chen Beiwang nodded repeatedly.

"Aside from the site selection, there's also the factory construction." With that, Chen Daoxuan retrieved a stack of blueprints from his storage pouch—designs for factory buildings he had meticulously drawn over the past five years.

As an experienced craftsman, Chen Beiwang found the designs novel but quickly grasped the layout of the factory depicted in the blueprints. He promptly nodded and said, "If the workshop buildings are to be constructed in this style, our craftsmen will have no problems."

Hearing this assurance, Chen Daoxuan's mood improved. "How soon can this factory be completed?"

"Six months will suffice."

Chen Daoxuan frowned. "Why so long?"

"Young Clan Leader, according to the material requirements in these blueprints, the factory construction requires high-quality bluestone. Our clan doesn't have many stonemasons, so the process of shaping the stone may be somewhat slow..." Chen Beiwang's voice trailed off toward the end.
