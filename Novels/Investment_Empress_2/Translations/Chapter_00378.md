# Chapter 378: A Warning, A Definite Warning!

Three days later.

A grand, red-black palanquin carried by eight men was traveling along a small path through the woods, a hundred miles from the city of Ziyang.

The palanquin was quite spacious. Through the curtains, one could see a handsome, fair-skinned young man in luxurious robes inside. He looked like a young master from a noble family, one who had indulged in too many worldly pleasures.

"Where is Luo Yexian?" the Demon Summoning Holy Son asked, twisting the ring on his index finger.

"He just sent a message, saying he is already waiting in Ziyang," a voice replied, emerging from the void. Only the Holy Son could hear it. This was a technique far superior to ordinary voice transmission.

"Hmph. If he weren't my uncle, and if we weren't in need of manpower right now..."

The Holy Son snorted, his mood clearly foul.

Lately, he had been growing increasingly suspicious of this so-called Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect. He had sent people to the Southern Frontier to investigate. The villages that had previously provided them with the Power of All Living Things to harvest were now busy chiseling mountains, digging rivers, and building roads, all claiming these were tributes to the Heavenly Venerable Immortal.

What true powerhouse would need such useless tributes?

Still, he was only suspicious.

Coincidentally, one of the three progenitor gods of their cult, the Dream God, had awakened. They had found some clues leading to the Dream God's cave dwelling, which very likely contained something extremely important.

Unfortunately, they still couldn't get in.

This was the perfect opportunity to test this so-called 'Heavenly Venerable's beloved disciple'.

"Greetings, Holy Son, nephew."

Before long, as they drew closer to Ziyang, Luo Yexian, dressed as a merchant, came forward to greet them on the path ahead.

"Why aren't we on the main road? What are we doing in this back alley?" the Holy Son asked, already annoyed at the sight of his uncle.

"Reporting to you, Holy Son, nephew, we are from the Demon Cult. If we take the official road, it would be far too conspicuous," Luo Yexian said with a look of deep thought and earnest gravity. "We bear the heavy responsibility of the cult; it is better to be cautious."

"......"

The Holy Son's eyelid twitched.

Dressing as a merchant and avoiding the main road for a back alley—was that really any less conspicuous?

But he couldn't be bothered to argue with Luo Yexian and got straight to the point. "Did the immortal you spoke of agree?"

"He did. The immortal said to meet tonight," Luo Yexian nodded, then asked with some confusion, "But why did we let the immortal set the time while we set the place?"

"Letting him set the time is to show respect. Us setting the place is to prevent him from making any preparations. It's possible that last time, you went to a place he had carefully prepared and that's why you fell for his trick," the Holy Son said, narrowing his eyes.

"Ah? How could that be? The immortal wouldn't deceive me..."

"Hmph. After so long in the Southern Frontier, have you truly become a frog in a well? The world is full of wonders. The people of the Yin-Yang Hall can turn men into women and women into men. The people of the Yellow Millet Hall can kill in dreams. It's entirely possible they used special means to deceive you. There is nothing impossible in this world!"

"You'll understand when you meet the immortal," Luo Yexian shook his head, still believing in the 'immortal' in his heart. After all, the immortal was his future, his great merit, his hope for rising high and breaking through to the Corporeal Realm. How could he doubt his own hope?

"Where did you choose for the meeting?" the Holy Son asked,懒得 to say more.

"The Happy Lamb Hotpot Restaurant."

"?"

"That hotpot restaurant is famous far and wide, and it's been open for a while. It absolutely couldn't have any connection to the other party. Moreover, it's crowded and chaotic, perfect for conducting certain affairs," Luo Yexian said, swallowing.

The Holy Son suspected that Luo Yexian's real reason for choosing the place was simply that he wanted to eat hotpot now that winter had arrived.

But he had no proof.

***

Happy Lamb Hotpot Restaurant.

"Waiter, one spicy hotpot, extra spicy, and five plates of lamb."

"Cu... Customer, our portions... our portions are quite generous."

"It's fine. I'm a martial artist; I have a big appetite."

"Alright..."

Jiang Chulong finished taking the order for this customer and turned to leave, but then poked her head back in for another look.

Sitting at the table was a young man with an immortal-like aura, wearing only a thin green robe in the cold weather, drinking by himself.

Princess Jiang felt that this figure seemed somewhat familiar.

She tilted her head and went to the kitchen.

She didn't know that the young man's gaze only fell on her back after she turned away.

"Chulong has grown quite a bit taller. She needs some new clothes."

"Right, I also need to prepare some red envelopes for the New Year..."

Li Mo had arrived in Ziyang at noon today.

He had arranged to meet the Demon Summoning Cult that evening. After all, only at night could he use *Sharing the Moonlight* to connect with the Ice Cube. Having the Cold Immortal as a backup was naturally better.

The location was to be decided by the other party, but he still hadn't received a reply.

Li Mo decided to come to the hotpot restaurant first to see Chulong and the little kids from Mud Horn Alley.

Unfortunately, he was currently wearing the Phaseless Glass Mask. To avoid unnecessary trouble, he'd have to wait until this business was over before he could be the hotpot restaurant boss again...

"Where will Luo Yexian choose?" Li Mo mused as he swished lamb in the pot, looking out the window as the sky gradually darkened.

Not long after.

The Beast Token in his sleeve vibrated again, bringing a new message: "Happy Lamb Hotpot Restaurant, awaiting your arrival."

"?"

Downstairs at the hotpot restaurant.

The Demon Summoning Holy Son, Luo Yexian, and a group of cult members dressed as merchants braved the snow and wind.

"It smells so good. It's almost as good as the barbecue in the Southern Frontier. It's intoxicating," Luo Yexian smacked his lips.

"Have you ever had barbecue, big nephew? The special kind from the Southern Frontier. Tsk, tsk, the flavor..."

"Did we come here to eat? Aren't you going to send the message?" the Holy Son asked, clenching his fist and suppressing the urge to punch him.

Thus, Luo Yexian shrank his neck and reached out to grasp the token.

But before he could send the message, his eyes suddenly widened.

"Big nephew..."

"In public, call me... forget it. What is it? Has the person arrived?"

"The immortal says he arrived early and told us to come up to the second floor."

"!!?"

The Holy Son's expression froze, and his breath hitched for a moment.

He... arrived... early?

But they were the ones who chose this place!

They had just stepped into the hotpot restaurant and sent the message, yet the other party had arrived before them?

What did this mean?

It meant the other party had known from the start that they would choose this place for the meeting!

"Was anyone following us on the way?" the Holy Son asked.

"Reporting to the Holy Son, both I and the Impermanence Dharma King sensed no one monitoring our movements."

That was true. If there had been a tail, the two Dharma Kings would have reported it to him long ago.

The Holy Son couldn't help but feel a bit more solemn.

To be able to make a Sixth Realm powerhouse sense nothing—no matter the method—it meant the other party's手段 were unfathomable!

"It's normal. The immortal saw right through my mahjong game back then... Ahem," Luo Yexian said with a smile. On the Holy Son's face, he saw the same shocked expression he had had when his bottom was seen through.

The Holy Son didn't even look at him and took a deep breath.

The other party arriving early and using unfathomable means to brazenly announce their presence—the meaning was now crystal clear.

What a show of force!

This was definitely a warning!

"Let's go up and meet them. I want to see for myself who this person really is!"
