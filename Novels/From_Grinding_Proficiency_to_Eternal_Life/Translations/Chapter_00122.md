Chapter 122: Scripture Pavilion

The nearly four-hundred-pound thunder-patterned steel hammer struck the green brick. In that instant, the internal structure of the brick was pulverized into dust by shockwaves, yet the surface remained perfectly intact.

Xu Yunfan’s pupils contracted in surprise. He hadn't expected that after integrating the Cicada Strength into the final move of the Cloak Hammer, "River of Heaven Reversed," the layered force that penetrated the bones—combined with the spontaneous aura of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, a supreme treasure—could achieve such an effect.

Looking at the green stone bricks within a radius of a zhang turned to dust beneath the hammer, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but twitch his mouth.

It seemed he would have to call the brothers from the Heavenly Craft Department, those old civil engineers, to come and repair it again.

He casually picked up a pebble and held it in his palm. With a slight exertion of strength, he crushed it into uniform lime powder.

If he were to vibrate a single finger at high frequency and gently place it on a human body, he could easily shatter the flesh and blood.

"Good skill, Junior Brother!"

By the time Fu Jin’s voice came from outside the moon gate, night had already fallen. The lights of the Heavenly Craft City were lit up, and looking down from the Foundry Hall halfway up the mountain, one could see most of the city.

Xu Yunfan, who was resting, stared blankly at his own forearm. Under the skin, faint golden patterns moved like living things. This was the physiological change brought about by reaching perfection in muscle and skin, and his bone density nearing a critical breakthrough point.

Upon reaching the Great Perfection of the Third Refinement, it seemed he could undergo a wondrous transformation he hadn't anticipated.

Hearing Fu Jin’s voice, he smoothed his sleeves and stood up to greet him.

"Senior Brother Fu is here?"

Fu Jin stepped into the courtyard carrying a lunch box, with a fine steel long sword in his other hand—it was the one Xu Yunfan had forged.

This usually steady eldest senior brother of the Foundry Hall now had rare excitement dancing in his eyes.

"Wow, when the three hundred 'Flow Pattern Swords' were being sorted in the Armory this afternoon, the high-nosed bunch from the Hidden Edge Pavilion almost fought over the last ten, wanting to keep a few for themselves."

Xu Yunfan was a bit surprised: "They're just mid-grade common artifacts, is it really that serious?"

"Of course it is. The head of the Melting Gold Hall was green with envy when he heard the news this morning. He used to be hostile to us openly or secretly, but now he's rushing to the Armory to compete with the Hidden Edge Pavilion."

Fu Jin took the dishes out of the lunch box and placed them on the table while saying, "Don't be surprised. There are naturally many weapons in the world, but those that can rank are very rare. Even a lower-grade common artifact is a family heirloom in the smaller households of your Northern Ye City. The Heavenly Craft Cave is blessed with unique advantages, so weapons are naturally abundant. That's why you don't feel it. Otherwise, why would the Nine Luminaries Sect be so eager to please us? Sit, sit, let's have a drink, my senior and junior brothers."

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't refuse. After drinking a few cups of green plum wine and eating a few bites of vegetables with Fu Jin, he noticed Fu Jin constantly stroking the fine steel long sword in his hand and suddenly asked, "Senior Brother Fu, have you ever felt that the Heavenly Craft forging technique is missing something?"

He picked up a raw iron blank he had brought back and casually kneaded it. His powerful finger strength made the metal change shape in his fingers like dough.

"Like... you can clearly see the direction of every forging pattern, but you can't touch their roots. It always feels like something is missing."

Fu Jin didn't mind seeing this. With his muscle-refining realm finger strength, he could easily crush iron into mud.

"Do you know how many processes the玄铁 (Xuantie) ingots used in forging have to go through?"

Fu Jin didn't beat around the bush and said directly: "The outermost layer uses the Thousand Layer Forging Method of the Melting Gold Hall, the middle hides the Honeycomb Shock Absorption Technique of the Mechanism Hall, and even the Dragon Blood Resin added during the quenching by the Medicine Hall. The smelting hammers cast by the Heavenly Craft Department, a selected iron ingot, the nine peaks and six divisions of the Heavenly Craft Cave, excluding the External Affairs Hall and the Hidden Edge Pavilion, the remaining four divisions are indispensable."

He paused, took another gulp of wine, rubbed his nose, and continued.

"The two words 'Heavenly Craft' encompass everything. The Melting Gold Hall is good at finding ore veins, able to distinguish Xuantie a hundred zhang underground. The Mechanism Hall specializes in mechanisms and is said to have found the secret of using the steam from boiling water to drive机关 beasts (mechanical beasts) weighing several tons. Even the quenching formulas of the Medicine Hall are divided into thirteen schools, such as Cold Pool, Earth Fire, Blood Quenching..."

At this point, Fu Jin sighed: "The Heavenly Craft forging technique covers the strengths of all divisions. Junior Brother, don't overthink it. Of the Weak Water three thousand, taking only one gourd is enough to benefit for a lifetime. If one day you can forge a true divine weapon, you will naturally understand that mechanisms are just a minor path, and the Medicine Hall's quenching is nothing special."

Listening to Fu Jin's drunken boasting, Xu Yunfan looked at the swords on the weapon rack and had already made a conclusion.

As a holder of a属性面板 (attribute panel), if he were to practice an incomplete technique, wouldn't that be a waste of a natural endowment? Being told this by Fu Jin made him feel like he had a fishbone in his throat, uncomfortable all over.

In his previous life, no matter what game he played, he wanted to get a full achievement. Even if it was a piece of trash, as long as he could unlock the achievements, he would hold his nose and get them all before running to the message board to curse it out.

Not to mention in this life.

If he could combine the strengths of several schools and obtain the complete Heavenly Craft forging technique, relying on the attribute panel, he might even be able to build a Gundam...

Early the next morning, after practicing the Lin Character Art at night and eating breakfast, Xu Yunfan practiced the Cicada Strength a few times before rushing to find his master, Zhan Yan.

When Xu Yunfan found Zhan Yan in the Thunderfire Cave, Zhan Yan was using special iron tongs to hold a piece of dark red metal, slowly quenching it, keeping it just at the point of turning red.

"You want a Scripture Pavilion token?"

Zhan Yan was a bit surprised: "Don't you have martial arts manuals?"

"Disciple feels that since entering the Heavenly Craft Cave for so long, I haven't been to the Scripture Pavilion yet. I had a sudden urge today and want to go take a look."

Zhan Yan threw the blood steel into the quenching pool. The red-hot metal block炸起 (exploded with) a three-zhang-high steam in the cold spring. He patted his hands and took a few gulps of cold wine.

"Wanting to achieve the Three Unifications of the External?"

"...Not exactly. Disciple feels it's still early, wanting to try to perfect bone refining. This trip is just to broaden my horizons and see if other martial arts have any reference value."

Zhan Yan nodded. "I've pondered the Cicada Strength carefully. It's unique in the path of bone refining and can forge a body of fine steel bones. By then, practicing the玄钢百锻诀 (Xuan Steel Hundred Forging Art) within the Thousand-Pound Mountain Shaking Hammer Method will have a natural advantage. In that case, going to the Scripture Pavilion to take a look is indeed a good thing."

After speaking, Zhan Yan turned around and continued to fish the metal ingots out of the quenching pool, swinging a heavy hammer to continuously forge a gun blank with 'clanging' sounds.

After a while, Zhan Yan turned back and saw Xu Yunfan still standing there, surprised: "Why aren't you going yet?"

Xu Yunfan felt a bit embarrassed: "Master, you haven't given me the Scripture Pavilion access token yet."

"What do you need that thing for? With the true disciple token at your waist, you can go anywhere except the two restricted mechanism areas of the Heavenly Craft Cave."

"..."

By the time Xu Yunfan arrived at the Scripture Pavilion, it was already the You hour (5-7 PM).

He submitted his true disciple token to an elder guarding the Scripture Pavilion. Watching the other party press a mechanism, a socket popped out on the counter.

He pressed the token in, making a 'click' sound. A scroll of portrait popped out from a hidden compartment below. The elder unfurled it, and inside was a portrait of him.
