# Chapter 80: The Day of the Full Moon, When Comparison Results Are Announced

"So... who won in the end?"

"Haven't you realized? We're the ones who lost!"

"No, buddy, I'm out of this game, throwing in the towel."

"Alright, alright, you little rascal..."

"Damn you! Let go of my hand!"

Amidst voices filled with extreme jealousy, complex emotions, and utter frustration, Li Mo finally managed to move.

He looked up, meeting those cool, inscrutable eyes. From his low vantage point, her delicate face was like snow under frost. Yet, amidst the myriad of chaotic shouts, Li Mo found a strange tranquility. He heard a certain heart beating, seemingly faster than usual.

"Ahem!"

An ill-timed cough broke the spell; it was Shangguan Wen Cang. Good times were always fleeting. Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Li Mo awkwardly got up. His mind was still a bit muddled. What had just happened? Oh, right, he hadn't managed to stop himself in time and had stumbled into Ying Bing's arms. But could he be blamed? The aura hidden within the Ice Lump's sword qi was simply too chilling.

Li Mo thought, casting a sideways glance at Ying Bing. The girl didn't look at him. If not for the lingering delicate fragrance at the tip of his nose, it would seem as though nothing had happened. But Li Mo was certain: the heart that had suddenly started beating faster just now wasn't his own...

"It's good that neither of you are injured."

"As for the victor..."

Shangguan Wen Cang's gaze swept over the young man and woman, a hint of surprise in his eyes. This truly put him in a difficult position.

"He/She won."

They spoke in unison.

Ying Bing was referring to their wager.

Li Mo, on the other hand, felt that he shouldn't take advantage and then act coy. In fairness, he had indeed lost just now. It was only because he had fallen into her arms that the Ice Lump hadn't delivered the killing blow. In terms of strength, there was indeed a gap. Unless he activated the World Seed and unleashed the Calamity Meteorite Hammer, but that power was beyond his own control and not yet fully his.

After a moment's thought, Li Mo added, "Our private wager, of course, only concerns the two of us."

Seeing his sincere tone and lack of attachment to the so-called Chief Disciple position, Shangguan Wen Cang nodded. "Since that is the case, Ying Bing shall be the first place of the martial arts assembly, the contemporary Chief Disciple."

As his voice fell, cheers erupted from below the arena. All the people on the high platform also rose, offering their unanimous congratulations. The Chief Disciple of their generation, the future Sect Master of Qingyuan, naturally required their recognition.

Among the crowd, the white-robed young master from Fen Yulin stared with fervent eyes, then looked at Li Mo nearby, a hint of dissatisfaction flashing in his gaze. The blood-robed young master did not rise, but the relaxed nonchalance in his eyes was gone, replaced only by an unresolvable sense of danger and contemplation.

On the arena, Ying Bing simply replied, "Yes." She wasn't overly concerned with the title. For her, it was enough that both she and Li Mo had entered the top three. Whether she was the Chief Disciple of Qingyuan Sect held little significance; it wouldn't affect the system's ranking. The system ranked prodigies not by fame.

Shangguan Wen Cang wore a helpless expression. He had some understanding of Ying Bing's personality; she was truly one who harbored no external desires. Perhaps it was precisely because of this that she could reach a height unattainable by her peers. It was truly frustrating that the two most qualified individuals for the Chief Disciple position were both uninterested, but there was little he could do.

He clasped his hands behind his back and declared in a clear voice, "For this martial arts assembly, all those who ranked highly shall receive rewards."

"The top three may enter the Scripture Pavilion and select one Absolute Art. The remaining disciples will each receive various rewards."

"Your talents are exceptional, and in the future, you shall all be pillars of the sect. With the current turbulent state of the world, I hope you will all continue to maintain your drive for improvement."

...

At the mention of Absolute Arts, countless gazes once again turned towards the two individuals who possessed Frost Sky and Scarlet Firmament respectively. The rumors surrounding these two swords had been long-standing and evergreen within the sect. Were these rumors true or false?

If these two were to choose their corresponding sword arts, then the truth would finally come to light.

...

Just as the martial arts assembly drew to a close, many changes occurred within the sect that day, and many new rumors began to circulate. Yet, life in Autumn Water Pavilion remained as usual.

Li Mo hummed a little tune, clanging pots and pans as he cooked in the kitchen. The stream flowing through the courtyard gurgled pleasantly. The stream seemed to have become even more imbued with spiritual energy lately, causing the peach blossoms along its banks to bloom with exceptional vibrancy and splendor. A single petal drifted down with the wind, landing gently on an open book, serving as a bookmark for the maiden. The book clearly read: *Moonlight Sword Canon*. And a copy of *Sun Wheel Sword Canon* lay quietly nearby.

"Dinner's ready!" Li Mo poked his head out from the kitchen.

Ying Bing rose to help him carry the dishes from the kitchen.

"Master, Master?" Li Mo patted the woman in the rocking chair, but she remained motionless, offering only a beautiful back. Li Mo, thinking she had fallen asleep, walked around to face her. He saw his Master's eyes were vacant, as if her soul had departed, and she was muttering to herself. Leaning closer, he heard her saying something like: "My money... my money..."

Li Mo: "..."

It seemed Master had gone bankrupt again, and was heartbroken. But this wasn't his fault. Li Mo knew exactly how to handle such situations. He placed two jars of fine wine beside her, knowing that once she drank herself into a stupor and woke up, she would be full of vigor again. After doing all this, he returned to the table.

He ate his meal while flipping through the sword canons. This was his first time encountering an Absolute Art-level sword technique, even if it was only a low-grade one. After reading for a while, he let out a long sigh. Absolute Art sword techniques were truly difficult... He felt like a middle school student trying to solve a university-level problem.

The Ice Lump, she couldn't be...

"I've finished reading it."

A copy of *Moonlight Sword Canon* was suddenly handed to him. The implication was that she wanted to swap books. Li Mo was speechless. He wouldn't be able to learn it anytime soon anyway, so he handed over the sword art in his hand.

After a long moment, Ying Bing's clear, faint voice sounded. "What did you make of it?"

"Uh... I'll read it again when I get back to my room." Li Mo buried his head in his food. He recognized all the characters in both sword arts, but when put together, why did they seem so utterly foreign?

After dinner, Li Mo picked up both sword arts, intending to return to his room. Behind him, Ying Bing's voice came, "Tonight, don't stay in the room next to mine."

"It's best to stay a bit further away."

Hmm? Li Mo didn't understand why, but he nodded anyway. "Then I'll sleep in the side chamber."

Ying Bing looked up at the moon, which hadn't fully risen in the sky. Today was the day the system would announce its comparison results. It was also a day of Yin Moon and Yin energy, the time of the full moon in the year. Her physique would be exceptionally terrifying today, to the point where even she couldn't fully control it, only narrow the affected range.

*Thump—*

The sound of the young man ascending the stairs drifted down. She involuntarily withdrew her gaze, looking at the retreating figure.

*The last move he used.*
*Was that also obtained through some fortuitous encounter?*
*His talent seems not to be limited to the sword path alone.*

Dispelling these distracting thoughts one by one, Ying Bing also returned to her room, quietly waiting as time ticked by. At this moment, nothing else mattered. This life was slightly different from her past experiences, and many unexpected things had occurred. But the ultimate outcome would not change.
