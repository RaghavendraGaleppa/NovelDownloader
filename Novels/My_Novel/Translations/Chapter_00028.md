Chapter 28: Severing Ties and Joining the Competition

“Madam is a master of the martial world, widely experienced, having participated in all kinds of heroic events and grand gatherings of chivalrous heroes.”

“The sights and sounds she has witnessed are truly as vast as the sea. If not for Madam’s recounting, I would never have known that such things exist in this world.”

Pang Long felt genuine admiration.

He would shake the bell every li he walked. The “clang clang” sound produced an indescribable feeling.

“Madam said... this creature is called the Snow Demon Monkey. It is a type of demon between heaven and earth.”

“And this bell of mine is a treasure, named the Exorcism Bell. Creatures like this will flee as soon as they hear it from afar. They absolutely dare not come within half a step.”

Pang Long explained.

It was around the hour of Si (9-11 AM), when the Yang energy was abundant. Li Xian led the way in front, following his memory to turn onto a fork in the road.

After walking three or four li, they saw a pool of blood.

Feng Huo’s corpse lay in the pool of blood, his belly sliced open, his five viscera and six bowels spilling out.

Because the blood had run dry, his skin showed a terrifying pallor. His facial features were frozen in his final moment—resentment, unwillingness, and fear... like a lifelike ice sculpture.

“It seems it is just as Madam predicted.”

Pang Long frowned, crouching down to observe for a moment. The spilled viscera had already congealed, mixed with frost.

He said, “That thing is extremely picky. It likes to eat human gallbladders and livers. Feng Huo’s gallbladder and liver have been plucked and eaten while still warm.”

“That is why it likes to tease and frighten its victims when killing, scaring out all their胆气 (gall bladder energy), making their livers and gallbladders burst from fear. To it, this makes them taste better.”

“What a vicious demon.” Li Xian recalled the events of last night; it was truly a narrow escape.

Seeing Feng Huo’s tragic state, Li Xian felt the world was a dangerous place. He and Pang Long joined forces to bury Feng Huo by the roadside and erected a small wooden tablet.

While burying Feng Huo, Li Xian reached into the lining of his clothes, rummaged around, and found seventy copper coins.

“This delivery fee... you guys have no fortune to enjoy, so I shall accept it with a smile.”

“The greatest tragedy in the human world is undoubtedly dying with money left unspent. Rest assured, I... will help you spend it all.”

He calmly put the coins into his own pocket.

Pang Long knew about this but didn't care.

“Hurry up and find the rent money to complete Madam’s task.”

The rent money had been on Feng Huo’s body, but during the frantic escape last night, Li Xian had seen with his own eyes that he threw it away.

They searched another seven or eight li along the road and found something in a tree. The hundred-plus taels of rent money were all in the bag. The mouth of the bag was tied tightly, and the money hadn't fallen out.

A careful count confirmed the amount was correct.

Pang Long said, “Since we are here, let’s bury the other men’s corpses together.”

“Alright!” Li Xian nodded, thinking to himself: “That delivery money... should still be there.”

The two walked forward and successively discovered the corpses of Zhao Dachun, Ye Xiaoluo, and Qiao Dashou.

Before death, their eyes were wide open, and feces and urine had flowed everywhere.

Seven corpses in total were all buried.

Feng Huo had seventy copper coins, Ye Xiaoluo forty, Qiao Dashou sixty. Although Zhao Dachun hadn't received the delivery fee, he had savings of over a hundred copper coins himself.

Together, the seven men’s money amounted to about five hundred copper coins.

It all flowed into Li Xian’s pocket.

“Commander Pang, if you don’t want any, shall we split it?” Li Xian touched his nose, feeling a bit too embarrassed to keep it all for himself.

“You keep it.” Pang Long waved his hand.

Back at the manor, Pang Long left Li Xian behind and headed straight for the inner courtyard.

“Madam, it is indeed as you predicted. It is the Snow Demon Monkey.”

Pang Long walked to a pavilion and knelt on one knee, reporting the truth.

The pavilion was seven stories high, each story three zhang tall, standing towering. A plaque in front read “Quiet Contemplation Building.”

This building was Madam’s secret place; no one could enter. After Pang Long finished speaking, hearing no response, he didn't dare leave on his own. He remained kneeling like that.

A long time passed.

A voice came from upstairs.

“I know.”

Pang Long then stood up, bowed respectfully to the pavilion, and turned to leave.

***

Meanwhile.

Li Xian returned to the manor. Thinking he had suddenly struck it rich and had a day off, he decided to treat Zhao Han and the others to a good meal.

He pushed open the door to the room and saw all three were there.

Li Xian was about to speak.

But he was interrupted by the gloomy atmosphere.

Zhao Han rubbed his face and said, “Li Xian... it’s good you’re here. The three of us have something to discuss with you.”

“Alright, go ahead.” Li Xian closed the door.

Wang Chun’s eyes were bloodshot. “Did Feng Huo, Zhao Dachun, and Ye Xiaoluo really die yesterday?”

“Yes.” Li Xian nodded.

Zhuo Yilie glanced at Li Xian’s face imperceptibly and muttered to himself, “Why didn’t you die?” A trace of hatred hidden in his eyes.

Zhao Han said, “It’s like this. According to the manor rules, your bunk shouldn't be here. You were staying here temporarily, but we didn't make that clear to you before. I...”

“No need to explain.” Li Xian said indifferently, “Just tell me where I’m moving to.”

How could he not understand? The barrier between them was too deep; the three of them were no longer willing to share a roof with Li Xian.

“It’s in Residence 147.” Zhao Han said.

“Since our friendship is severed, a true man should be magnanimous and not be sentimental.” Li Xian cupped his fists to the three of them. “I understand your thoughts perfectly. Whether you hate me or curse me.”

“From now on, we are strangers. But I will still keep my previous promise. There is no need for more words. Farewell.”

Li Xian had nothing much to pack. A quilt, a bucket, a towel, plus a set of clothes. After a simple packing, he pushed the door and left.

Leaving the three of them exchanging glances.

“Tch!”

“He acts so carefree, but it’s not him who suffers!”

Wang Chun punched the bed.

“We shouldn't have let him in the room in the first place.” Zhuo Yilie said.

Zhao Han remained silent. Reason told him that the true culprit behind this matter was the domineering Jiang Yun.

But he couldn't keep his reason, and he still took his anger out on Li Xian. He simply wanted to not see him, so he wouldn't be annoyed.

“Pity us three brothers, we’ll probably be stuck with these palm prints for life.”

Zhao Han sighed deeply.

The next day.

[Four Directions Fist]
[Proficiency: 816/1500 Small Success]

After an hour of hard practice, the Four Directions Fist had progressed steadily.

Li Xian felt his fist technique attainments were already quite good. With the Guard Competition approaching, he thought:

“I should participate in this Guard Competition as early as possible. If I can be promoted to Class C Guard sooner, I’ll have more time to practice martial arts.”

“I currently have one tael and over five hundred copper coins. How should I use them best?”

At noon, Li Xian used his break time to find Pang Long, wanting to sign up for the Guard Competition and顺便 (顺便) buy some pills.

But upon hearing that Li Xian wanted to participate in the Guard Competition, Pang Long was immediately surprised.

Pang Long confirmed again, “You’ve been a guard for less than a month and have only learned one martial art, yet you want to participate in the Guard Competition?”

“Yes.” Li Xian nodded heavily. “At least I’ll give it a try. Even if I can’t do it, I can gain experience.”

“I advise you not to think that way.” Pang Long’s expression was serious. “When sparring, it’s hard to avoid injuring people. If the strength gap is too big, it’s not impossible to die in the competition.”

“Although the competition between Class D and Class C Guards isn’t too intense. But some veteran Class D Guards have been practicing martial arts for seven or eight years. How can you compare?”

“If I were you, I’d settle down and practice one fist technique to Small Success. Then learn other martial arts to broaden my horizons before trying the Guard Competition.”

“By then, even if it’s not a guaranteed win, at least the strength gap won’t be too big. Even if I lose, I’ll be able to protect myself and won’t leave behind any hidden troubles.”

“But...” Li Xian said, “Commander Pang, my Four Directions Fist has already reached Small Success.”

“It’s only Small Success, that’s still far off... Wh... What? You... you’ve already reached Small Success?!” Pang Long’s jaw dropped in shock.
