# Chapter 641: The Wolf Cub

Xu Yunfan explored these heavenly treasures to contemplate the image he needed to condense.

He was only a step away from reaching the perfection of the Foundation Establishment realm, but the image that suited him still required careful consideration.

What he pursued was not simply eternal permanence, but rather a glimpse of immortality within the divine Xiao Thunder that could shatter all laws—a true indestructibility that nurtured new life amidst destruction.

This was both his longing for longevity and the core essence of the *Xuanqiong Indestructible True Scripture of the Nine Divine Xiao Palaces*.

The divine Xiao thunder was merely the process; the Xuanqiong's indestructibility was the foundation.

As he quietly meditated while gathering the heavenly treasures, Xu Yunfan's spiritual image gradually became clear.

It should be an endless, chaotic Xuanqiong, boundless and eternal, containing infinite possibilities.

At the center of this Xuanqiong, rather than being dead silent, there was a boiling, roaring thunder pool.

The pool did not contain ordinary thunder water, but rather a thick, magma-like purple-gold plasma. Every single drop contained the destructive power to obliterate all things. This destructive force was not an end; at the very bottom of the thunder pool, a speck of light shone tenaciously. It was not an external star, but pure vitality and order born from destruction itself—tiny yet resilient, like an indestructible spark.

It absorbed the violent thunder force and slowly released a gentle starlight to nourish the Xuanqiong.

This was the Dao he sought: tempering indestructibility amidst endless destruction, and nurturing new life within the destructive thunder.

The Xuanqiong as the body, the thunder pool as the furnace, the starflame as the seed. Life and death cycle, unchanging for ten thousand generations.

"It should be like this."

The more grandiose the image, the greater its power, but it also meant a higher difficulty to condense it. However, for Xu Yunfan currently, this was not an obstacle.

Just as he was collecting a table-sized Thunder-Attracting Xuan Stone at the bottom of an ice-cracked canyon, a violent and fierce aura, accompanied by a piercing stench, suddenly pressed down from above the canyon.

The heavy sound of its landing made the entire canyon's ice walls tremble, with ice crystals raining down like a shower.

Xu Yunfan slowly raised his head.

A giant beast stood at the edge of the canyon. Its fur was like the finest ice, shimmering with a cold, hard metallic luster under the dim light. It stood over nine zhang tall, resembling a moving iceberg, its muscles knotted and full of explosive power.

Its four claws dug into the frozen soil, leaving deep imprints. Its massive wolf mouth opened slightly, revealing dagger-like, pale-white teeth. Its hot breath turned into white mist in the cold wind.

Most intimidating were its eyes. The ice-blue vertical pupils burned with primitive bloodlust and fury, locked tightly onto Xu Yunfan in the canyon.

It was none other than洛坎 (Luo Kan), the Wolf God of the Ice Plains, bordering the territory of Frost Thunder City.

"Tarthus!"

Luo Kan's voice was like two huge ice rocks grinding together, carrying an uncontrollable rage that echoed rumblingly through the canyon.

"You have such huge guts! You dared to severely injure my shaman priest and steal my预定 (yùdìng - destined/prey) prey? Are you challenging the dignity of the Wolf God?"

*As fellow mid-tier gods, is it really appropriate to act so condescending?*

Tarthus, inside the banner,及时 (jíshí - timely) spoke up: "Master, I've fought him many times, with victories and defeats on both sides."

At this moment, Tarthus felt an inexplicable sense of pleasure. *If we could capture this cunning wolf cub inside, it would be truly satisfying!*

Xu Yunfan casually tossed the collected Thunder-Attracting Xuan Stone into the space within the Star Spirit Banner in his sleeve. Following Tarthus's past habits, he put on an expression mixing disdain and impatience, waving his hand as if shooing away a fly.

"Luo Kan, your few卑贱 (bēijiàn - lowly)信徒 (xìntú - believers) acted recklessly on my territory. The fact that I didn't turn them into焦炭 (jiāotàn - charcoal) on the spot is already me showing you some pathetic face."

"As for that bit of nascent spiritual light? Heh, it's ownerless; naturally, the strong take it. What, do you have an opinion?"

His tone was filled with undisguised provocation and a "what can you do about it" attitude.

This was exactly what he was waiting for—a sufficient reason. Otherwise, how could he provoke a battle?

"Roar!"

Luo Kan was彻底 (chèdǐ - completely) enraged by this merciless humiliation. Violent divine power, like a tangible ice storm, exploded from his body. The surrounding air temperature dropped sharply to the edge of absolute zero.

"Tarthus, you're seeking death! Do you want to start a divine war early?!"

"Divine war?"

The corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth curled up, a flash of thunderlight disappearing from his eyes, carrying a hint of anticipation.

"You were the first to cross the line, and you were the first to lose your temper. Since you are so eager, then let's fight!"

*So straightforward?*

The still-furious Wolf God was slightly taken aback by Xu Yunfan's words.

The next instant, he saw Xu Yunfan move. He didn't use divine power exceeding the scope of the Thunder God, even concealing the aura of the Star Spirit Banner. He purely wanted to test this snow wolf's strength and lay the groundwork for future plans.

He was currently the Thunder God Tarthus; his combat style had to be roughly similar.

*Boom!*

Before the words fully faded, Xu Yunfan's figure suddenly expanded.

A three-zhang tall Golden Body Dharma Form of the Martial Dao appeared instantly.

Three heads and six arms, covered in crystal scales flowing with purple-gold thunder patterns. The main head glared fiercely; the left head's eyes were closed in focus, the Lin character Dao rune flowing; the right head chanted the Divine Xiao True Word, thunder rolling.

The six arms were knotted with muscles, with threads of destructive electric snakes wandering between the scales.

Seeing this, the Wolf God Luo Kan no longer hesitated. With a howl, he pounced towards Xu Yunfan. His four claws, using only physical strength, easily tore through the air, bringing up waves of turbid white气浪 (qìlàng - air waves).

"Manifestation of Law and Heaven!"

The Dharma Form's main head let out a earth-shaking battle cry. The two golden-armored arms in front formed the Purple Thunder Seal and fiercely met Luo Kan's descending giant claw, which was entwined with freezing divine power and sharp ice blades.

*Bang!*

*Cr-cr-crack!*

The instant the fist and claw collided, the explosion of thunder and the shattering of ice crystals sounded simultaneously.

A violent shockwave spread out in a ring, instantly flattening the ice walls dozens of zhang high on both sides of the canyon.

Purple-gold thunder arcs and ice-blue freezing divine power tore and annihilated each other violently. The space within a radius of hundreds of zhang was twisting violently.

Luo Kan's massive body was shaken slightly, a hint of suspicion flashing in his eyes.

*When did Tarthus's power become so condensed and tyrannical?*

*And what is with that three-headed, six-armed thing?*

A numbing sensation from being burned by thunder even came from his ice claws.

Xu Yunfan pressed his advantage without mercy, the Dharma Form's six arms moving together.

The left head's two arms were as fast as lightning. One hand formed a seal, drawing down游离 (yóulí - free/drift) ice plain thunder from the high sky, transforming it into a roaring thunder snake that bit towards Luo Kan's throat.

The other hand bent its fingers into a claw, carrying the劲风 (jìnfēng - sharp wind) that tore space, gouging towards his waist and abdomen vital points.

The right head's two arms操控 (cāokòng - controlled) divine power,布下 (bùxià - laid down) layer upon layer of thunder nets in front of him, blocking the freezing breath Luo Kan spat out.

The two arms in front swung openly and powerfully, the Purple Thunder Seals striking out one after another. Each blow was heavy and forceful, carrying the unique破灭雷罡 (pòmiè léigāng - destruction thunder aura) of the Divine Xiao Scripture, blasting the ice armor protecting Luo Kan's body into flying fragments.

Pure physical strength combined with the fierce application of Divine Xiao Thunder actually suppressed the Wolf God Luo Kan, who was several times larger than him, causing him to roar continuously and step back with every collision.

Each collision was like a battle between ancient巨兽 (jùshòu -巨兽), shaking the earth until it cracked and causing continuous avalanches.
