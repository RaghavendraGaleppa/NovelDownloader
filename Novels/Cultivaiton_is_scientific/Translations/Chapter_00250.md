# Chapter 250: Resources  

Li Shimin took out ten top-grade 'Shushan Huangling Pills' and handed them to Yin Shilan.  

After inspecting the pills, Yin Shilan showed a look of surprise, but as he had expected, she wasn't overly astonished.  

Her gaze at Li Shimin grew even more tender, like gentle water. Just these ten top-grade pills alone made her feel the depth of his affection for her.  

"Here are two hundred high-grade 'Shushan Huangling Pills.' I know you can obtain cultivation resources in the Thousand Illusions Sect, so these are for you to use as you see fit—whether for yourself or to give away. As a high-grade alchemist now, pills of this level mean nothing to me!" Li Shimin then took out a large jade bottle, explaining as he placed it in Yin Shilan's hands.  

Yin Shilan silently accepted it without thanks, just as she had once given him her most precious pills. To each other, they were the most important person in their hearts, worthy of giving and receiving.  

"Guess what this is?" Li Shimin took out another jade bottle, a hint of pride in his voice.  

"I'll love anything you give me," Yin Shilan whispered, placing her delicate hand over his, covering the bottle and touching his large hand.  

Likely, she would only speak such heartfelt words in front of Li Shimin in this world.  

"A couple of days ago, I obtained a Beauty-Retaining Flower and refined it into 'Beauty-Retaining Pills,'" Li Shimin said happily, holding her hand without making her wait too long.  

"Beauty-Retaining Pills?" Yin Shilan was usually not one for strong emotional reactions, and her feelings for Li Shimin had grown gradually over time. But upon hearing "Beauty-Retaining Pills," her beautiful almond-shaped eyes widened in excitement as she stared at the jade bottle between their hands.  

"Take it now," Li Shimin urged, gazing intently at her flawless face, wishing to preserve this moment forever.  

"Mm," Yin Shilan nodded slightly.  

After swallowing a high-grade 'Beauty-Retaining Pill,' she excitedly took out a mirror to examine her reflection. Seeing her skin become even more delicate, she threw her arms around Li Shimin in joy.  

The cultivation chamber was filled with an intimate atmosphere as the two embraced, silently savoring each other's presence without words.  

A woman adorns herself for the one she loves. Li Shimin's gift of the 'Beauty-Retaining Pill,' which would preserve her beauty forever, made Yin Shilan lose her usual restraint.  

Only after a long while did Yin Shilan notice the message talisman held by the cave formation.  

"Ah, Liang Yexuan is here!" she exclaimed, quickly smoothing her robes and tidying her slightly disheveled hair.  

---  

Li Shimin watched her movements with a smile. In his eyes, Yin Shilan was always the most beautiful, no matter what.  

Liang Yexuan, who had been growing impatient outside, was about to speak when the cave formation opened, revealing Yin Shilan and Li Shimin standing side by side. The words caught in her throat.  

Seeing Yin Shilan's radiant happiness and dewy skin, Liang Yexuan couldn't help but entertain certain thoughts.  

As close friends, she was familiar with Yin Shilan's complexion. For it to become so radiant in such a short time, coupled with Li Shimin's presence, it was hard not to jump to conclusions.  

"Shilan, I didn't mean to interrupt you two!" Liang Yexuan blushed, waving her hands.  

If not for fear of being impolite in front of Li Shimin, she might have turned and fled.  

"Don't talk nonsense!" Yin Shilan's face flushed as she hurried to cover Liang Yexuan's mouth.  

"Take care of yourself!" Liang Yexuan managed to say before her mouth was sealed, making Yin Shilan blush even harder.  

The two friends bantered for a while, but with Li Shimin present, they soon calmed down and returned to the pavilion.  

"You've reached the mid-stage!" Liang Yexuan sensed Yin Shilan's cultivation level and glanced at the jade cups still on the table. She realized why they had gone to the cave—Yin Shilan must have broken through after drinking the third-grade spirit tea.  

Li Shimin had already activated his 'Shadow Demon Buddha Technique,' displaying his cultivation at the mid-stage of Foundation Building.  

"Li Shimin, your cultivation speed is so fast?" Liang Yexuan was also surprised by his progress. The last time she saw him, he had only just broken through.  

"I'm an alchemist. Resources aren't an issue for me, so it's natural to progress quickly," Li Shimin replied with a smile.  

"I tried learning alchemy for a while, but I had no talent for it," Liang Yexuan said enviously, taking his words at face value.  

Yin Shilan watched Li Shimin deceive Liang Yexuan without exposing him. She understood that if he concealed his true cultivation level, he must have his reasons.  

That he revealed his real strength in front of her spoke to the trust between them.  

The thought brought a knowing smile to her face.  

Liang Yexuan, seeing Yin Shilan's smile, regretted coming over while Li Shimin was present.  

Li Shimin wasn't particularly close to Liang Yexuan, so he didn't offer the third-grade spirit tea. It wasn't an ordinary treasure, and until he reached the Golden Core stage, he likely wouldn't have much more of it.  

If Yin Shilan had asked, he would have gladly given all of it to her. But even for her best friend, he wouldn't casually offer something so precious.  

Of course, if he and Yin Shilan became cultivation partners, such considerations wouldn't be necessary.  

"Shilan, how has your skin changed so much?" Liang Yexuan couldn't resist asking after scrutinizing her.  

She could tell that Yin Shilan and Li Shimin hadn't done what she initially suspected in the cave. Yet even after all this time, Yin Shilan's skin remained as dewy and smooth as a baby's—a far cry from the day before.  

Such skin was usually only seen in infants or girls aged sixteen or seventeen. As one aged, the skin gradually lost this youthful quality.  

"Shimin gave me a 'Beauty-Retaining Pill,'" Yin Shilan admitted, unable to resist sharing her joy with her friend.  

"A Beauty-Retaining Pill? You mean *that* Beauty-Retaining Pill?" Liang Yexuan stammered, struggling to articulate her shock.  

Yin Shilan nodded, confirming her guess.  

"Li Shimin, can I buy a 'Beauty-Retaining Pill' from you?" Liang Yexuan immediately turned to him, her voice earnest.  

Li Shimin hesitated. Although he had several 'Beauty-Retaining Pills' left, their value wasn't something he wanted to squander. For female cultivators, these pills were more precious than most third-grade spiritual pills—meaning they could be traded for third-grade resources, and highly valuable ones at that.  

He glanced at Yin Shilan, who gave him an apologetic look. She hadn't expected Liang Yexuan to ask so directly.  

Having grown up in high cultivator circles, Yin Shilan understood the pill's worth far better than most.  

Liang Yexuan, however, was delighted. Seeing Li Shimin hesitate, she immediately realized he still had more 'Beauty-Retaining Pills.'  

"Li Shimin, name your price! Whatever you want, as long as you're willing to part with one!" she pressed eagerly.  

"One portion each of third-grade wood and water attribute formation materials. If you can meet that condition, I can spare one," Li Shimin said after some thought, stating his terms without reservation.  

Originally, he had planned to trade a 'Beauty-Retaining Pill' through the Northern Shu Trading House for these materials. But if Liang Yexuan could provide them, it would save him the trouble.  

"Wait here! I'll go ask my father!" Liang Yexuan didn't bat an eye at the request for third-grade materials. In fact, she found his price fair and immediately dashed off using a movement technique.  

"Shimin, I'm sorry," Yin Shilan apologized softly after Liang Yexuan left.  

"Between us, there's no need for that. It's just one 'Beauty-Retaining Pill,'" Li Shimin said with a smile, waving it off. Not wanting her to dwell on it, he changed the subject, pulling out a purple jade slip. "This is a spiritual sense cultivation technique I obtained by chance—not from the sect."  

He handed her the 'Thousand Refinements Divine Sense Technique.' As a formation master who had trained in spirit-enhancing techniques since childhood, Yin Shilan had developed spiritual sense early. Now at mid-stage Foundation Building, her spirit had grown stronger.  

Though not yet ready for the technique, a little more growth would suffice.  

He didn't know if the Thousand Illusions Sect had similar techniques, but even if they did, acquiring one would require immense contribution points—likely decades of effort and strong backing.  

"I've been needing a spiritual sense cultivation technique. The ones in the sect are too expensive for me," Yin Shilan said, her smile returning as she examined the jade slip, forgetting the earlier incident.  

With Liang Yexuan gone, the pavilion returned to their private world. Li Shimin and Yin Shilan enjoyed the scenery, sharing stories from their time apart.  

But their peaceful moment was interrupted less than an incense stick's time later by another message talisman.  

"Was Liang Yexuan that fast?" Li Shimin was surprised. Obtaining two third-grade formation materials on such short notice would require having them on hand.  

"It's Master," Yin Shilan said, equally startled. She stood to straighten her appearance before opening the formation.  

Li Shimin had met Yin Shilan's master before—the Golden Core formation master, Elder Luo.  

But meeting her again was awkward. Elder Luo had offered him entry into the Thousand Illusions Sect as an ordinary disciple, yet he had chosen the Shu Mountain Sect instead.  

In hindsight, his decision was right. There, he became a disciple of Elder Su, a Golden Core elder, and later a nominal disciple of Elder Ma, earning the title of Alchemy True Successor.  

Had he joined the Thousand Illusions Sect as an ordinary disciple, his achievements would have been far less certain.  

In the Shu Mountain Sect, his status had been second only to True Successors from the start, saving him years of struggle.  

Though he hadn't experienced the talent selection process of a major sect, he knew how it worked.  

Outer sect disciples were promoted annually, and no matter how talented a new recruit was, they had to wait a year to compete in the selection tournament—usually dominated by mid-to-late Foundation Building outer disciples. A newly advanced early-stage Foundation Building disciple stood little chance.  

Even if one miraculously won, they'd have to wait another year in the inner sect before competing for True Successor status—a contest that included disciples of Golden Core elders.  

Had Li Shimin not been directly promoted to Alchemy True Successor by Elder Ma, he would have had to participate in that grueling competition.  

Becoming a True Successor would have taken at least two years.  

Without that status, one's access to high-level resources and knowledge in a major sect was severely limited.  

Had he not been Elder Su's disciple, how could he have caught Elder Ma's attention? His entire path hinged on having a certain standing from the outset.  

As he mused, Elder Luo and another Golden Core elder descended outside the pavilion with Xiao Ke in tow.  

When Li Shimin met Elder Luo's gaze, her expression was complex.  

Back then, she had recognized his early sword intent and formation talent but dismissed him due to his poor spiritual root aptitude.  

Even if he became a formation master, his lifespan would cap at two hundred years—too short to justify the sect's investment.  

With Yin Shilan as an alternative—a formation prodigy with far better spiritual roots—Elder Luo had chosen her without hesitation.  

When Li Shimin declined to join the Thousand Illusions Sect, she felt no regret. Just another ordinary outer disciple.  

But she never imagined he would rise so swiftly, becoming the most renowned young high-grade alchemist in the Shu Mountain Sect—and perhaps all of Northern Shu.
