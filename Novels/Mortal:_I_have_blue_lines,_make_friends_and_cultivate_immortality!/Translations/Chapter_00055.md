# Chapter 55: Five Elements Spirit Infant - Wood Spirit Infant (1/3)

As Lin Yun finished speaking, a slender girl in green emerged from behind a large tree. She trembled slightly as she took in the sight of the three burly men before her.

"It's you?" Lin Yun asked. "With only Qi Refining level ten cultivation, what are you doing in the Bloody Forbidden Land?"

"Senior Brother Lin, I beg you," the girl pleaded. "Please let me have those Sunfire Blossoms! My elder brother is severely injured and needs them to survive."

This was none other than Han Yunzhi, whom Han Li and Lin Yun had met at the Tai Nan Gathering.

Han Yunzhi looked at Lin Yun with pitiful eyes as she made her request.

"How did you know there were Sunfire Blossoms here?" Lin Yun inquired.

"Some senior brothers from the Spirit Beast Sect discovered them during previous trials, but they weren't mature enough to harvest then," Han Yunzhi replied timidly.

She knew she stood no chance against Lin Yun, let alone the barefooted swordsman from the Giant Sword Sect beside him.

Lin Yun pointed at the Giant Sword Sect disciple. "You—go harvest those herbs."

"Ah—yes, Senior Brother Lin!" The disciple hurried into the stone hall and soon returned with several Sunfire Blossoms, along with some Purple Monkey Flowers and Jade Marrow Mushrooms.

"Here you are, Senior Brother Lin."

Lin Yun took the Purple Monkey Flowers and Jade Marrow Mushrooms, tossing the Sunfire Blossoms to Han Yunzhi. "With your cultivation level, this place is too dangerous for you. Find somewhere to hide until the trial ends."

"Thank you, Brother Lin!" Han Yunzhi beamed as she clutched the precious herbs.

[Ding! Han Yunzhi's favorability +10. Current favorability: 70 (Admiration and Gratitude).]

[Ding! You have gifted Han Yunzhi medicinal herbs—Sunfire Blossoms, triggering "Cast your bread upon the waters."]

[Ding! Congratulations, host, for obtaining: Five Elements Spirit Infant—Wood Spirit Infant.]

[Treasure Description: Originating from the lost great divine ability of the Spirit Control Sect's Five Elements Spirit Infant technique. Through a secret art, it can merge with a cultivator, granting them the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator without extending their lifespan. Han Yunzhi was once a candidate for fusion with the Wood Spirit Infant.]

Glancing at the system notifications, Lin Yun was surprised. "The Wood Spirit Infant?"

He remembered this item—it was something Han Li had captured in Yuanwu Country and later refined into his second Nascent Soul using the Mystic Yin Infant Transformation technique obtained from Xin Ruyin.

Lin Yun had no intention of cultivating this so-called second Nascent Soul technique. His Mystic Heaven Five Elements Art was already resource-intensive enough. He hadn't even decided whether to raise the Gold Devouring Beetles from the Chaotic Star Sea in the future, let alone bother with a second Nascent Soul.

Moreover, once he completed his Mystic Heaven Five Elements Art, a second Nascent Soul would be meaningless to him. The last thing he needed was a repeat of Han Li's experience with a runaway second Nascent Soul.

"Still, this is interesting. I wonder if it can be fused into the Mystic Heaven Five Elements Seal," Lin Yun mused.

"Never mind that for now. Even if it could be fused, I'd need to capture the other four first."

Having obtained what he came for, Lin Yun realized he'd already spent three days in the Bloody Forbidden Land. By now, Zhou Qingning should have joined forces with Nangong Wan—it was time for his grand plan.

He took out a specially crafted talisman—a "Parent-Child Talisman." The child talisman had been placed on Zhou Qingning when she was bound by vines earlier.

Following the talisman's guidance, Lin Yun tracked the Moon Mask Sect's group from a distance.

Meanwhile, Han Li had arrived at the stone hall.

Standing before the entrance, Han Li hesitated. The information about this place came from Spirit Beast Sect's Zhong Wu, and none of the maps he'd collected mentioned it.

"Better safe than sorry. I should leave," Han Li decided. Just as he turned to go, he sensed a large group of cultivators approaching.

Forced to act, Han Li slipped into an underground passage.

The cavern stretched over several miles, its ceiling thirty zhang high. Black, bubbling mud covered the ground. At the center stood a white jade pavilion housing a floating golden chest—ten feet long and five wide, its surface shimmering with golden light.

Han Li was astonished, but he had no time to investigate. His pursuers had already entered the underground realm, among them Zhou Qingning, the Moon Mask Sect disciple Lin Yun had spared earlier.

Outside the stone hall, Lin Yun watched the Moon Mask Sect members enter. "I wonder if that old schemer Han Li is already inside," he murmured.

He didn't need to guess—Han Li was definitely there.

"Let's go in and play it by ear. I'll find a way to send Han Li away."

"Old Han, watch as I find you a sister-in-law."

Back underground, the Moon Mask Sect was battling a second-grade Black Flood Dragon.

Though Nangong Wan's Vermilion Bird Ring was formidable, her current Qi Refining cultivation limited its power. Even with her mid-grade talismans and the support of her disciples, the battle was grueling.

Flood dragons were among the mightiest of beasts, and this one's dark mist shield and venom-laced water bullets—equivalent to mid-grade spells—made it a formidable foe. After molting, its power increased further.

The Moon Mask Sect disciples suffered heavy losses. One panicked disciple, Miss Zhao, accidentally killed a comrade and severely injured others with a misfired mid-grade talisman.

As their numbers dwindled and Nangong Wan's talismans ran low, the flood dragon gained the upper hand.

"This is bad!" Nangong Wan realized. "At this rate, we'll be wiped out!"

"Everyone retreat! This flood dragon has reached second-grade—its power rivals a mid Foundation Establishment cultivator! I'll hold it off while you escape!"

Knowing her inexperienced disciples were no match, Nangong Wan ordered their retreat. Several came from prominent Moon Mask Sect families—like Miss Zhao, whose noble background explained her possession of mid-grade talismans. They'd joined hoping for an easy path to Foundation Establishment, never expecting this calamity.

"Go now!" Nangong Wan snapped coldly at her hesitating disciples.

Muttering angrily, she added, "A mere second-grade serpent daring to challenge me! If I had my full power, I'd have captured you as a guardian beast long ago!"

The terrified disciples fled through the tunnel—only to be blasted back by a thunderous explosion.

"Well, well," a voice rang out. "What a big fish I've caught."

"How shall I repay you Moon Mask Sect bastards for ganging up on me with the other five sects?"

"Brother Lin?!" Han Li, hiding in the shadows, was shocked. "How did he find this place? And so timely?"

His gaze shifted to Zhou Qingning. "It must be her!" Now he understood why Lin Yun had let her go—to track the Moon Mask Sect and strike at the perfect moment.

"What brilliant strategy! While I was on the first level, Brother Lin was five steps ahead. Truly worthy of him!"

"Lin Yun?!" Nangong Wan was equally stunned by his sudden appearance. "What do you think you're doing?!" she demanded angrily.
