# Chapter 31: How Many Times Must I Say It? Address Me by My Title When We're in Public!

Lin Yun's actions left Han Li utterly dumbfounded. 

With some concern, Han Li asked, "Brother Lin, isn't this too much? Making such a big scene seems rather ostentatious."

Being at the center of this storm, under the scrutiny of so many eyes, made Han Li extremely uncomfortable. He much preferred observing quietly from the shadows.

"What's there to fear? Haven't you heard the saying 'the law doesn't punish the masses'?" Lin Yun replied with a sidelong glance and a smile.

Han Li studied Lin Yun, sensing his motives ran deeper than they appeared. Even if Lin Yun targeted Elder Ye, with the Chen family's backing and his own talent for talisman-making, the Yellow Maple Valley would likely turn a blind eye.

"This young man has some tricks up his sleeve," Xiang Zhili mused, his gaze lingering on Lin Yun after joining the crowd in chanting his name. But then he shook his head. "A pity, though. Burdened by fame and fortune, his cultivation path won't take him far."

"Elder Yan, isn't it inappropriate to let this fellow stir up trouble like this? He's even dragging the sect leader into it. Couldn't we have handled this ourselves without involving all these Qi Condensation disciples?" one of the Chen family's Foundation Establishment cultivators, a young man, complained.

"Ahem—" The elder at the head of the group coughed twice. "Xiao Yu, you're a Foundation Establishment cultivator now. You should know what's appropriate to say and what isn't. Regardless of whether this escalates, who do you think the higher-ups will side with?"

"The Yellow Maple Valley has many potential sect leaders, but only one genius capable of crafting intermediate-grade talismans."

"If you can't stand someone else stealing the spotlight, close your eyes."

"Yes—Elder Yan, Chen Yu understands his mistake." The young man was taken aback, having expected support but receiving a reprimand instead. 

However, someone as young as him couldn't grasp the situation as clearly as the shrewd Elder Yan. What Lin Yun faced now was hardly a problem. Once he became an intermediate-grade talisman master, even if they resented him, they'd still have to fawn over him.

Lin Yun raised his hands above his head, waving to the two to three hundred Qi Condensation cultivators before lowering them again. The crowd immediately fell silent.

"Everyone, I'm undeserving of your admiration. How can someone of my shallow virtue and meager cultivation uphold justice for you all?" Lin Yun demurred with an expression of humility.

"We won't accept anyone else—only you!" the Qi Condensation cultivators roared in unison.

"We've all come from far and wide, united by our shared goal of immortality, to join the Yellow Maple Valley. Yet who could have imagined that behind the facade of glory lies endless sorrow?"

"Where are the spirit herbs, spirit grasses, magical instruments, talismans, and Foundation Establishment Pills we once dreamed of? They're nowhere to be found!"

"Here, we suffer nothing but endless exploitation and oppression from the Foundation Establishment cultivators above us!"

"We must rise and unite! Stand together as friends to protect our collective interests!"

"Will you join me, Lin, in this friendship? For the sake of our brighter tomorrow?"

"Yes! Yes! Yes!" The two to three hundred Qi Condensation cultivators chanted fervently.

Xiang Zhili glanced around and joined in the chorus. "Yes."

[Ding. Xiang Zhili has sent you a friend request.]

[Ding. Congratulations, host, on obtaining the cultivation technique: Profound Heaven Five Elements Art.]

[Ding. Congratulations, host, on obtaining a spirit herb: Blackbone Flower, and a top-tier magical instrument.]

A series of system notifications chimed in Lin Yun's mind. Fortunately, he had muted them in time, or the noise would have been unbearable.

A quick glance at the friend requests revealed that what he'd obtained from Xiang Zhili wasn't a spirit treasure but a cultivation technique. A flicker of disappointment crossed his eyes.

Xiang Zhili, a peak early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, undoubtedly possessed spirit treasures. In the original story, he had explicitly told Han Li that he and the other Nascent Soul cultivators of the Great Jin each owned spirit treasures. Moreover, among them, only Xiang Zhili had successfully traversed the spatial node. 

Though he was later possessed by a demon, he had indeed crossed the spatial node. The spirit treasure he carried was likely defense-oriented, a necessity for Lin Yun, who also planned to sneak into the Spirit Realm.

While it wasn't a spirit treasure, obtaining a Spirit Realm cultivation technique—the Profound Heaven Five Elements Art—was a pleasant surprise. Lin Yun narrowed his eyes. "This technique has quite the audacious name, claiming to be 'Profound Heaven' despite only reaching late-stage Nascent Soul!"

A quick scan of the technique left Lin Yun delighted. "This is quite intriguing."

"No time to delve into it now. I'll study it in detail later."

Making friends with two to three hundred people at once had yielded a bountiful harvest. Though he hadn't obtained Xiang Zhili's spirit treasure, the Spirit Realm technique was a welcome consolation, especially since it addressed Lin Yun's lack of a suitable cultivation method.

He had even considered practicing the same technique as Han Li—the Azure Essence Sword Art. But a single-attribute technique would waste his Five Spiritual Roots. Moreover, his slow cultivation speed had been resolved through the Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light generated by dual cultivation with Chen Qiaoqian.

Now, with the Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light, his cultivation speed surpassed even that of a Heavenly Spiritual Root. The only downside was that each dual cultivation session produced too little of the True Light to be of much use.

The arrival of the Profound Heaven Five Elements Art couldn't have been more timely.

Thank you, my dear friend Xiang Zhili!

Beyond the Spirit Realm technique, the Refined Iron alone was worth two thousand spirit stones, not to mention the thirty-odd top-tier magical instruments, over eighty high-tier ones, and assorted pills, herbs, and miscellaneous items.

An absolute windfall!

And this was just from two to three hundred people. There were still over ten thousand more waiting to befriend him! Lin Yun grew even more determined to expand his social circle within the Yellow Maple Valley.

"Let's move out!" Lin Yun stepped forward, raising his arm. "Demand justice!"

"Demand justice!" 

"Demand justice!"

After the collective roar, over a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators and two to three hundred Qi Condensation disciples followed Lin Yun as they flew toward the Hundred Tasks Hall.

The Qi Condensation disciples' willingness to trust Lin Yun stemmed not only from their shared grievances but also from the presence of the Chen family members beside him. Everyone knew they represented one of the Yellow Maple Valley's three great families.

Now was the time to strike while the iron was hot!

The Ye family's Foundation Establishment cultivator had his own cave, but he wasn't there now. As the overseer of the Hundred Tasks Hall—where sect disciples received assignments—he was currently lounging with a cup of tea, reveling in his lucrative position. Skimming a spirit stone here, another there, it all added up to a tidy sum each year. The only downside was having to share a portion with the sect leader to keep his cushy job.

"Grandfather, when will you give me that Foundation Establishment Pill?" Ye Long asked impatiently.

"Mn—what did you call me?!" Ye Ming's face darkened. "How many times must I say it? Address me by my title when we're in public!"

"If others learn of our true relationship, how will I face them? What will my fellow disciples think?!"

Ye Long recoiled, resentment boiling inside. "Damn old man! If you were so afraid of being discovered, why did you force yourself on Grandmother and humiliate your own brother?!"

Outwardly, however, he adopted a submissive tone. "Yes, Master. Please understand—I'm eager to advance, to become a Foundation Establishment cultivator."

Seeing his grandson's contrition, Ye Ming sighed. "Xiao Long, your cultivation is only at the twelfth level of Qi Condensation. Let me refine a batch of Qi Condensation Pills to push you to the peak of Qi Condensation. That will be the optimal time to attempt Foundation Establishment."

"Thank you, Master!" Ye Long's face lit up at the promise of pills.

Their conversation was interrupted as a Qi Condensation disciple stumbled in, panic-stricken. "Elder! Trouble! A handsome daoist named Lin Yun is outside—demanding you come out!" 

"Mn?!" Ye Ming frowned angrily. "Who dares summon me?!"

"What are you all doing?! Useless fools!"

"You—go teach this Lin Yun a lesson! Show him who rules the Hundred Tasks Hall!"

"Me?" The disciple pointed at himself, his face ashen. "Elder, I can't!"

"Lin Yun didn't come alone—he's brought a massive crowd with him!"

"At least two to three hundred people!"

"What?!" Ye Ming's eyes bulged in shock. "Two to three hundred?!"
