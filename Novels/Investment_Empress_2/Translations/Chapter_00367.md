# Chapter 367: The Glorious History of Little Li Mo, Miss Is Doomed When She Is with Him!

“Sir, what are you doing here?”

Li Mo greeted him sheepishly.

The old scholar stared at Li Mo, leaning back slightly, his face instantly turning dark as if facing a great enemy.

“What’s it to you? Go play somewhere else and don’t cause trouble here.”

“What’s wrong with this child?” Ying Xuliang asked, puzzled.

He only knew that Brother Li’s child was born physically weak, perhaps sharing a similar plight with Bing’er.

He never expected the teacher to react as if his fur had been set on fire the moment he saw Li Mo.

The old scholar, brimming with anger, began to recount Little Li Mo’s “glorious deeds” as if counting his treasures:

“On his very first day of school, he used firecrackers to blow up the latrine.”

Ying Xuliang laughed upon hearing this, thinking the teacher was making a mountain out of a molehill.

“Ah, that... haha. Boys will be boys. I did something similar when I was little. I even set off firecrackers in cow dung with Brother Li.”

“But I was inside at the time!” the old scholar said through gritted teeth.

“......”

Ying Xuliang fell silent for a moment before smiling and trying to comfort him again.

“Children are mischievous. It is only with a teacher’s guidance that they can become talented. Just teach him properly.”

“That’s what I thought back then. But not long after, he and another student had a contest in my garden to see who could pee farther. All my precious orchids, which I had treasured for years, died.”

The old scholar was heartbroken.

“Um, I heard that organic fertilizer is good for flowers... and besides, the latrine at the school had collapsed at the time...” Li Mo’s voice grew smaller and smaller.

“Who collapsed the latrine?” the old scholar’s eyes widened.

Madam Ying, standing beside Ying Xuliang, covered her mouth, a hint of amusement in her eyes.

Clear River County wasn’t large. The couple had been students of the old teacher in the past and were classmates with Li Dalong.

“Teacher, it’s not a big deal to relieve oneself in a random place...”

“Ask him who he did it with!”

“???”

Little Li Mo looked a bit confused.

He had done so many things as a child, and with the awakening of his memories from the womb, it was even more blurry.

“He took a little girl with him and taught her to pee standing up, competing to see who could pee farther!”

“......”

Little Li Mo fell into deep thought.

Did he really do something so awesome when he was little?

He only remembered the things that made the old teacher put on a “righteous face.”

Madam Ying’s smile froze, and the way she looked at him became noticeably more cautious, as if she were looking at a little terrorist.

Ying Xuliang awkwardly laughed and said, “Jade must be carved to become a tool. Jade must be carved to become a tool...”

“The key is that this little demon can’t learn the teachings of the sages. Just like his father, he’s not cut out for studying.”

“‘Everyone has something to hold onto’—that’s what Dad taught me,” Li Mo said, rubbing the back of his head.

“Anyway, since Miss Bing is already sick and can’t be stimulated, I only dared to let her go to school after I saw that the little demon was no longer in the private school.”

The old scholar shook his head, the anger in his eyes lessening, replaced by a sigh.

This little fellow is mischievous, but also very smart. It’s a pity he doesn’t apply his mind to studying.

Seeing that he couldn’t see the ice lump, Li Mo grew a little anxious.

*To untie a bell, one must find the one who tied it.*

This is a dream formed by the Ice Lump’s soul and memories. If he can’t meet the dream’s owner, how can he unravel it?

And time is tight; he can’t wait for a few days in the dream to come again.

The Disaster Beast is coming to the Ying family courtyard tonight.

However!

He is the Little Li Genius!

---

Especially in the art of pleasing old men, he has some authority.

“Old teacher, a prodigal who returns is more precious than gold. In fact, I did listen seriously in class.”

“What did you listen to?”

“You once wrote a poem specifically to encourage me to study.”

Little Li Mo cupped his hands seriously, speaking as if it were true:

“It’s a pity that back then, I was young and ignorant and didn’t understand its profound meaning. Now that I think of it, I realize the teacher’s painstaking efforts.”

“?”

The old scholar stroked his beard, stunned.

When did he ever write a poem to encourage study?

For a scholar who values his reputation, if he had written a masterpiece, he would never forget it even in his dotage. Besides, with Li Mo in the school, he was terrified all day long; how could he have the mood to write poetry?

But Li Mo had already picked up a nearby tree branch and began to write it down, stroke by stroke.

For him, who had been tempered by compulsory education, many masterpieces were at his fingertips. Back then, it wasn’t just the textbooks; the teachers outside had taught him many.

For students, there was naturally no shortage of the eternal theme of “encouraging study.”

Setting aside those that didn’t fit the situation, he could still pick out one or two.

“Youth is easily aged, but learning is hard to achieve.”

“A moment of time is not to be lightly wasted.”

“The dream of spring grass in the pond is not yet felt.”

“The sound of autumn is already at the steps before the plane tree.”

Eh?

Madam Ying also came from a scholarly family and had some talent for poetry and prose. Upon seeing this poem, she fell into thought.

Many guests and Ying family members gathered around, marveling at the sight.

“This is... I...”

The old scholar’s face flushed red, and he was at a loss.

The poem was excellent, but it had nothing to do with him.

“This was initially a mischievous work of your student. You, teacher, helped polish it and gave it back to me. You even said you would hang it at the school’s entrance to inspire the other students,” Li Mo said timely, giving the old teacher a way down.

Moreover, he spoke loudly enough for the guests to hear. They flattered the old scholar, saying they would send their own sons and nephews to his school in the future.

Listening to the flowery praise, the old scholar’s face beamed with radiance. He let out a long breath, feeling a sense of accomplishment.

“This little demon... ah, Mo-zi is indeed still teachable. He has finally applied his mind to studying.”

“Come back to the private school after the New Year. Keep it up!”

“Thank you for your teachings!”

Li Mo cupped his small hands and bowed respectfully.

Ying Xuliang looked at the beaming old teacher and then took a deep look at Little Li Mo.

“Uncle Ying, can I go see Sister Bing now? I promise I won’t cause any trouble.”

“Alright. My wife, you take Mo-zi there.”

Ying Xuliang nodded slightly. His wife was about to deliver a meal anyway, so he had her lead Li Mo as they walked into the Ying family mansion.

The mansion was much larger and more imposing than he remembered, exuding elegance and refinement.

By comparison, the Li family’s house was just an ordinary rural courtyard.

Little Li Mo didn’t think much of it back then, but seeing it again now, he felt this was definitely not the grandeur of a small county in the Eastern Wilderness Domain.

“How has Sister Bing been lately?” Li Mo asked.

“She’s developed a strange illness,” Madam Ying sighed.

“She gets bouts of extreme coldness all over, and she’s unwilling to communicate with people. We only thought to let her go to the private school to be with people her own age...”

She stopped halfway, thinking it was unnecessary to say so much to a child.

As they spoke, the surroundings grew quiet as they arrived at the courtyard room in the separate compound.

The door was tightly shut, but it couldn’t stop the chill flowing out from within.

PS: I originally wanted to release two chapters together for better continuity, but I thought about the second chapter and the subsequent plot arrangement for too long and wrote slowly. Orz.
