# Chapter 9: Fragrant Pills  

**"Black Tiger Seizes the Heart."**  

A wooden stake stood before Zhou Qing as he executed the familiar strike—swift, fierce, and precise.  

After a while, his fist inevitably swelled.  

Zhou Qing retrieved the bruise-relieving ointment he had recently purchased and applied it evenly to his injured hand. Then, he began practicing the Tiger Exercise.  

As usual, a faint warmth emerged within him, working in tandem with the medicine to visibly reduce the swelling. Simultaneously, his fist subtly strengthened, becoming more powerful. Throughout this process, his palm did not grow rough; instead, its outer layer hardened slightly.  

To maximize the effectiveness of *Black Tiger Seizes the Heart*, Zhou Qing focused solely on training his right hand rather than his left. Being naturally right-handed, his right arm was already stronger.  

Given his current condition, his entire body was weak. Rather than trying to shore up all his deficiencies, it made more sense to strengthen one area first.  

Again and again, he practiced *Black Tiger Seizes the Heart*. Each time his fist suffered damage, he applied the ointment and then performed the Tiger Exercise, harnessing that mysterious warmth to repair and reinforce his fist.  

The progress was incremental, but his sweat was not wasted.  

Ten days later, when Zhou Qing executed *Black Tiger Seizes the Heart* again, his punch actually shattered the wooden stake. Ignoring the sharp pain in his fist, he exhaled deeply, a trace of satisfaction on his face.  

With *The Art of Nourishing Life* and that mysterious warmth, his efforts would never be in vain.  

Focusing his attention on *The Art of Nourishing Life*, he saw:  

**Martial Skill: Black Tiger Seizes the Heart (Proficient).**  

From the first day of practice to reaching proficiency, nearly twenty days had passed.  

However, when Zhou Qing attempted to further refine *Black Tiger Seizes the Heart*, he encountered resistance.  

"Although my right hand has strengthened considerably, the power behind *Black Tiger Seizes the Heart* comes from the entire body. Continuing to focus solely on this technique would yield diminishing returns."  

"I should devote more effort to the Tiger and Deer Exercises to improve my overall physique."  

Every day on his way to and from the village school, Zhou Qing traveled using the Deer Exercise method, deliberately carrying a bookcase laden with extra weight. However, his spare time was still mostly spent on *Black Tiger Seizes the Heart*, pushing the technique's limits to prepare for unexpected situations.  

His identity as a scholar was his foundation, but as the saying goes, *"When scholars meet soldiers, reason falls on deaf ears."* If he ever encountered unreasonable ruffians, having a means of self-defense would be invaluable.  

Looking at the shattered stake, Zhou Qing was pleased with his progress over the past days. His students would never guess that their seemingly frail and scholarly teacher possessed such strength.  

---  

His current appearance effectively concealed his actual combat prowess. In a direct confrontation, he might still be outmatched, but if he resorted to a surprise attack, even the constables tasked with catching thieves would likely be knocked out with a single punch.  

However, martial training was undeniably expensive.  

Between medicine, daily consumption of fish, chicken, and rice, he had already spent five hundred copper coins in ten days—and that was with careful budgeting.  

Moreover, his appetite was steadily increasing. His body was still developing and needed to recover from previous deficiencies. No matter how frugal he was, he couldn't cut back on food.  

Even if Butcher Hu repaid the remaining ten strings of cash and he received his government stipend as a stipendiary scholar, it still wouldn't be enough to sustain his martial training—let alone the expenses of studying for the imperial examinations.  

He didn’t necessarily need to aim for the provincial exams, but he at least had to prepare for the prefectural school’s assessments.  

Besides, *"Gold for a Provincial Graduate, Silver for a Metropolitan Graduate."* With the status of a provincial graduate, he wouldn’t have to worry about martial training expenses anymore.  

The provincial exams were still two years away, but that didn’t solve his immediate financial struggles.  

Money seemed to vanish faster the more he spent.  

He needed to find a way to increase his income. Additionally, the Education Intendant would be visiting the village school tomorrow to assess academic standards, and Zhou Qing had to prepare for that.  

Since registering as a scholar, he had only met the Intendant, Lu Ya, once—strictly for official business. As for Intendant Lu’s nephew, Wang Hai, Zhou Qing hadn’t seen him since that day.  

"Since I was chosen as the top candidate, it means the Intendant favors me. I don’t need to worry too much—just handle it normally."  

Zhou Qing’s thoughts returned to making money.  

As a scholar, finding profitable work wouldn’t be difficult. The challenge was earning money *respectably*.  

Many scholars ended up impoverished precisely because they cared too much about maintaining appearances.  

But Zhou Qing had plenty of ideas. If he could earn money honorably, that would be ideal. If not, he wasn’t so rigid as to refuse alternatives.  

After carefully reviewing his memories and considering the era, he settled on a potential income source:  

**Selling medicine.**  

Not life-saving medicine, but a formula from *Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold* called **"Five-Fragrance Pills."**  

These pills could eliminate bad breath and body odor. Given Jiangcheng’s bustling commerce, there would surely be a market for such a product. Moreover, this venture could help him enter the medicinal market and find ingredients to aid his martial training.  

Having read *Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold*, the formula for Five-Fragrance Pills was already in his mind. However, he first needed to confirm whether similar products already existed in the market.  

---  

After inquiring at several prominent pharmacies and cosmetic shops in Jiangzhou City, Zhou Qing found no equivalent to Five-Fragrance Pills. This gave him confidence—he only needed to check the largest pharmacy, **Jishi Hall**, to make a final decision.  

**Jishi Hall.**  

"Scholar Zhou, have you come for more bruise-relieving ointment?" The shopkeeper, Han, was now quite familiar with Zhou Qing.  

They had known each other before, but they only grew closer after Zhou Qing became the top scholar.  

Zhou Qing shook his head. "Not this time. I still have plenty left. I came to ask about another medicine—does your shop carry it?"  

Using up so much ointment so quickly would raise suspicions. To avoid unnecessary curiosity, Zhou Qing claimed he still had a surplus—he couldn’t very well admit he was deliberately injuring himself daily.  

He described the effects of Five-Fragrance Pills.  

Shopkeeper Han shook his head, but being astute, he stroked his beard and said, "What Scholar Zhou describes sounds similar to *Cold Fragrance Pills*. Those are quite precious—even wealthy young ladies can only afford to use one or two occasionally."  

Zhou Qing understood.  

Jishi Hall was indeed knowledgeable, recognizing a comparable product. He recalled *Cold Fragrance Pills* from *Dream of the Red Chamber*—they were indeed costly.  

In contrast, the ingredients for Five-Fragrance Pills were common, ensuring they would sell well.  

After this inquiry, Zhou Qing didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he chatted with Shopkeeper Han about poetry and literature before finally taking his leave.  

Shortly after, a young woman emerged from the back of the shop, followed by several maidservants.  

"Greetings, Miss." Shopkeeper Han bowed respectfully.  

The young lady was the granddaughter of Squire Lin. Curious, she asked, "Was that gentleman just now Scholar Zhou Qing?"  

"Indeed."  

"Does he often come here to buy medicine?"  

Shopkeeper Han explained Zhou Qing’s circumstances—how both his parents had passed away from illness.  

The young lady sighed. "What a pitiable man. From now on, whenever he buys medicine here, charge him half the cost—no profit. Even as a scholar, the expenses of social engagements must be burdensome. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have rented our family’s old residence just to study in peace."  

With that, she left with her maids, boarding a sedan chair.  

*This Scholar Zhou must be deeply devoted to his studies, possessing an upright character. He’s managed to live peacefully in that old house—truly an honest gentleman.*  

Upon returning, she relayed Zhou Qing’s situation to Squire Lin.  

The old man chuckled. "Whether he’s truly a gentleman remains to be seen. Let’s test him further. If he proves honorable and upright, we’ll befriend him properly. If he’s willing, we might even assist his rise to prominence. Who knows—it could become a fine tale in the future."
