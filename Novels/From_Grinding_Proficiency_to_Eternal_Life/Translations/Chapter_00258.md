# Chapter 258: Corpse Disintegration to the Dao

Xu Yunfan looked on with growing shock. The young man atop the high platform was surrounded by dust yet remained resplendent, shining with an inner light.

It was as if he were...

"Breaking free from the cocoon to become a butterfly..."

Su Zhenhe spoke with a mix of delight and terror, "That person... it seems he is undergoing Corpse Disintegration to become an immortal! This is his place of enlightenment!"

Below the high platform, Zhou Tianyan and his group stood frozen, their expressions grave as they stared at the white jade platform, hesitant to proceed.

Zhou Tianyan was now clad in the Nine Flame Sect's robe adorned with the Nine Luminaries pattern, a scorching blade hanging at his waist. The blade's body faintly glowed with a dark red firelight, clearly brimming with power, ready to strike at any moment.

The disciples beside him were also on full alert, their eyes darting between the man on the platform and their surroundings, clearly filled with apprehension toward the scene before them.

Just then, Zhou Tianyan noticed Xu Yunfan and Su Zhenhe's arrival. His gaze swept over them, lingering on Su Zhenhe for a moment before he sneered. "I wonder who it is. So it's Daoist Su from the Xuanzhen Sect. What? Does your Xuanzhen Sect also want a piece of the pie?"

Su Zhenhe glanced quickly at Xu Yunfan. Seeing that Xu Yunfan had no intention of speaking, he stepped forward with a calm expression and cupped his fist. "Brother Zhou jests. The opportunities in this secret realm are for those with the affinity to obtain them. What is this talk of sharing a piece of the pie?"

Zhou Tianyan naturally noticed Su Zhenhe's deference to Xu Yunfan, but he paid it no mind. He sneered, "With the meager foundation of your Xuanzhen Sect, what right do you have to speak of 'affinity'? Two thousand years ago, your people died mysteriously, and now you dare come here to throw your lives away?"

A chill flashed in Su Zhenhe's eyes, but his tone remained even. "Brother Zhou is mistaken. The truth of that matter is still unknown. Did the Nine Luminaries Sect not suffer heavy losses as well? That prodigy of yours, hailed as a talent seen once in a millennium, also fell back then."

Zhou Tianyan's face darkened, and he was about to retort when Xu Yunfan suddenly spoke. "Do you recognize the man on the platform?"

Zhou Tianyan finally turned his gaze to Xu Yunfan, sizing him up and down. When he saw the Dragon Scale Armor Xu Yunfan wore, watching it flex and move with his breathing, a strange look flashed in his eyes. With his discernment, he could tell that only a spiritual armor would possess such a phenomenon.

A spiritual armor naturally ranked among divine weapons. And such a full-body armor was something even his Nine Luminaries Sect did not possess.

His mind raced, and upon confirming that Xu Yunfan was not from one of the six major sects, Zhou Tianyan's eyes filled with a rapidly expanding greed. If he could obtain this divine weapon and precious armor, his strength would rise several levels within this secret realm.

Currently, those who could enter this secret realm were at most at the Outer Three Unifications. Even if they had gained some opportunities and made breakthroughs these past few days, they would be at most at the Flesh Refining Realm.

He, Zhou Tianyan, possessed astonishing talent and had already reached the Flesh Refining Realm. Naturally, he did not fear these two.

"Who are you? What right do you have to ask about the affairs of my Nine Luminaries Sect?"

Xu Yunfan remained unfazed, merely looking at the group with a calm expression.

"...Aren't you going up to take a look?"

Seeing that Xu Yunfan didn't answer but instead posed a calm question in return, the mockery in Zhou Tianyan's eyes deepened. He sneered, "What? Don't even have the courage to introduce yourself? And you dare act so pretentiously in front of this young master?"

The scorching blade in his hand trembled slightly, and a crimson blade energy roamed its edge, clearly ready to strike.

Xu Yunfan's gaze was calm but carried a hint of impatience. On the surface, however, he maintained a polite demeanor, just in case he had misjudged and ended up stumbling right at the start, which would be truly laughable.

He asked politely, "May I ask what realm you have reached?"

Hearing this, Zhou Tianyan glanced at Su Zhenhe beside Xu Yunfan. He understood that Su Zhenhe was likely Xu Yunfan's foundation. In that case...

A smile appeared on his face as he raised his head proudly. The vital energy and blood throughout his body surged, his robe stirred without wind, and a sharp aura burst forth suddenly. "Perfected in the Flesh Refining Realm, just a step away from Blood Exchange! What, are you scared now?"

The disciples of the Nine Luminaries Sect beside him also wore sneers, clearly believing Xu Yunfan was humiliating himself.

"The Flesh Refining Realm..." Xu Yunfan repeated in a low voice, his expression finally relaxing, a hint of relief flashing in his eyes. "If that's the case, then this will be easy."

Su Zhenhe had already silently taken several steps back.

He still couldn't see through Xu Yunfan, but in general, this person was likely one who liked to suppress others with his overwhelming strength and disliked putting himself at a disadvantage.

Before the words had fully faded, his figure suddenly shot forward!

*Boom!*

The Dragon Scale Armor's scales flexed, releasing a scorching torrent of air. Xu Yunfan became a stream of fire, instantly closing the distance to Zhou Tianyan.

Zhou Tianyan's pupils contracted violently. He hastily raised his blade to block, but Xu Yunfan's strike was as powerful as a thousand jun. The Raging Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel, carrying a violent force, slammed heavily onto the Scorching Blade!

*Clang!*

The sound of metal clashing echoed through the great hall. Zhou Tianyan felt an irresistible, immense force surge toward him. The skin on his palms split instantly, and the Scorching Blade almost flew from his grasp!

The Scorching Blade was no weaker than the Nine Incinerating Blade that had just opened the hall; in terms of 'vibration,' it was even superior, able to dissipate the force of an opponent's attack. Yet, despite this, he still found it difficult to withstand.

Zhou Tianyan stumbled back several steps, his eyes filled with disbelief. "You...!"

Xu Yunfan gave him no chance to catch his breath. His figure, like a phantom, closed in again. The Raging Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel swept out. The Golden Marrow swayed with his movement, and explosive force surged from his palm. The cudgel's body blazed with crimson flame, like a fire dragon roaring and tearing!

Zhou Tianyan gritted his teeth and swung his blade to meet the attack. However, Xu Yunfan's assault was too violent. Every strike contained a thousand jun of force, shaking his blood and energy into turmoil and numbing his arms.

He was terrified to the extreme. He had only felt such power from a Marrow Cleansing Realm master—his own master, to be precise.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. Although the other party possessed a divine weapon, his strength was too weak. If Xu Yunfan had used his full force just now, holding nothing back, a single strike from the cudgel would have turned the man into a charred corpse.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

Three heavy strikes in a row, and Zhou Tianyan could no longer hold on. The Scorching Blade was sent flying, and his body was thrown backward, crashing heavily into a pillar of the hall. A trickle of blood seeped from his mouth.

He was furious and terrified, a hint of fear surfacing in his heart. He subconsciously touched the precious armor on his chest.如果不是有这件宝甲，徐云帆最后那一锏的力量足以将他的身体打成两截。如果不是 this precious armor, the force from Xu Yunfan's final strike would have been enough to snap his body in two.

"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!"

This small world's secret realm had been calculated by his master. Only martial artists at the Outer Three Unifications could enter!

Zhou Tianyan turned his head and roared at the stunned disciples, "What are you standing there for?! All of you, attack together!"

The disciples of the Nine Luminaries Sect finally snapped out of their daze and drew their blades to surround and attack.

However, Xu Yunfan let out a cold laugh. The Dragon Scale Armor's scales suddenly flared outward. Pure Yang Internal Breath, combined with his explosive force, formed a layer of air armor around him, deflecting all the incoming blade energies.

His figure flashed, a tiger entering a flock of sheep. The Raging Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel swept and smashed. Every strike precisely landed on the weak points of the opponents' weapons. In just a few breaths, the Nine Luminaries Sect disciples had their weapons knocked away and fell to the ground, wailing in pain.

Without the slightest hesitation, Xu Yunfan, though intending to spare Zhou Tianyan and the others' lives, would not leave them unharmed.
