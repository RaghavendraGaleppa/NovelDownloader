# Chapter 29: Hiding One's Talents

Yang Can's small courtyard was separated from Chief Steward Li Youcai's by only a wall, and the architectural layout of the two courtyards was identical.

When Yang Can returned to his residence, Wangcai was dozing off, slumped over a table.

As soon as he saw Yang Can return, Wangcai hurriedly rubbed his eyes and stood up. "Master Yang, Master Li said that I will be serving you from now on."

Yang Can nodded. He knew that Wangcai was a hereditary servant.

In this era, those with a status lower than that of a free citizen were two types of people: servile households and servants and maids.

Servile households had a slightly higher status than servants and maids; they were generally miscellaneous households with special skills, such as musicians and artisans.

As for servants and maids, their status was even lower, as they were considered private property that could be bought and sold at will.

If they were to be gifted to others, it was naturally up to the master's discretion.

Thus, for Li Youcai to gift Wangcai to Yang Can was merely a matter of a single sentence.

Yang Can said, "Understood. Wangcai, it's late now, there's no need to serve me. Go get some rest."

Wangcai acknowledged the order and retreated from the main room.

The courtyard's layout was the same as Steward Li's, and Wangcai had spent the afternoon tidying it up with Pan Xiaowan.

He naturally knew where he was supposed to sleep and went straight to the wing room. His bedding had already been moved in during the evening.

Feeling a bit tipsy and weary, Yang Can returned to the bedroom, saw that the bedding was complete and all new, and went straight to sleep.

The next morning, after Wangcai had swept the courtyard, he drew well water for his master to wash up upon waking.

Then, he waited by the corridor, eager for Yang Can to take him to breakfast.

Their three daily meals were provided collectively.

Of course, if a steward of Li Youcai's status had a family and wished to cook for himself, that was also permitted.

The communal dining area was called the "Women's Kitchen Courtyard" in the inner residence and the "Lower Kitchen" in the outer residence.

The Lower Kitchen was further divided into a "Great Canteen" and a "Small Canteen." Naturally, Yang Can dined at the Small Canteen.

Most of the stewards he had met at the welcome banquet the previous day were there for breakfast.

Because of the drinking session last night, they had already grown closer.

As soon as Yang Can walked in, these stewards greeted him one after another, creating a harmonious and joyful scene.

Yang Can scanned the room but didn't see Li Youcai. "Does the Chief Steward not usually eat at the 'Lower Kitchen'?" he asked.

Steward Li, the accountant, replied with a smile, "The Chief Steward has a young, lovely wife now, so of course he's reluctant to let her get up early to prepare soup. He usually eats here as well.

However, our Chief Steward cannot do without alcohol and gets drunk every time he drinks. The morning after drinking, he generally can't make it to mealtime."

"I see," Yang Can said.

When he was a guest advisor, he also used to eat here often.

However, back then, he hadn't paid special attention to Li Youcai's movements, so he wasn't aware of this.

Seeing that Yang Can had arrived, the kitchen staff promptly brought out his meal.

Yang Can's breakfast consisted of two types of pastries, two small side dishes, and a bowl of wontons.

The pastries were golden-threaded jujube paste yam cakes. The snow-white yam cakes were cut into thumb-sized cubes, topped with candied golden-threaded jujubes.

With one bite, one could taste the delicate, smooth texture of the yam paste, the sweet but not cloying jujube paste filling, and a faint aroma of osmanthus.

There were also two steamed lotus-leaf buns made from fine flour, which counted as another type of pastry.

As for the two small side dishes, one was a plate of five-spice braised fish chunks, made from the thick-fleshed Long River catfish.

It was first marinated, then fried, and finally braised. The braising sauce was a bright, glossy red, shimmering with oil. A bite revealed a crispy exterior and tender interior, with the five-spice flavor penetrating deep into the flesh.

The other side dish was pickled turnip greens, cut into fine shreds and mixed with a little fragrant sesame oil.

There was also a bowl of shepherd's purse and pork wontons, made with fresh shepherd's purse from early spring and the hind leg meat of mountain-ranging pigs.

A little dried shrimp was added, and the broth was made from old hen, mushrooms, and diced bamboo shoots to create a fresh, savory stock.

Yang Can's "small kitchen" standard was, in the outer residence, on par only with Li Youcai's, and much higher than that of the other stewards.

This was because, as stewards, the meals they ate were the same as the master's.

That is to say, they were all prepared by the small kitchen chefs, though the standard of the meal was slightly lower than that of the main household.

As Yang Can ate, he chatted casually with Steward Li the accountant and the other stewards.

After everyone had finished their breakfast with laughter and conversation, Yang Can returned to his residence.

Yang Can first familiarized himself with the inside and outside of his small courtyard. By the time the sun was high in the sky, he saw Li Youcai walking over with unsteady steps.

A large bruise marked his forehead. Following behind him was Laixi, who was carrying two chests on a shoulder pole.

As soon as Li Youcai saw Yang Can, he laughed and said, "The Clan Head did summon me, and he gave me some instructions.

These chests contain all the ledgers and documents for the six large manors and three great pastures.

Take them and have a good look. If there's anything you don't quite understand, you can ask Steward Li for help."

Yang Can quickly expressed his thanks. Glancing at the "Nike swoosh" on his forehead, he probed cautiously, "Brother, did you rest well last night? Still feeling the effects of the alcohol?"

Li Youcai laughed. "I did drink a bit too much last night. Look at the bump on my forehead, it's made me a laughingstock for you, little brother.

Fortunately, your sister-in-law is virtuous. First, she patiently helped me wash my body, then she prepared a sobering soup and fed it to me spoonful by spoonful. Otherwise, I'd be feeling even worse right now."

As he spoke, he moved his neck and gently touched his forehead, explaining to Yang Can with a smile, "Your sister-in-law was afraid I'd vomit from the alcohol, so she had me sleep with my head propped up high. See, now I've got a stiff neck, haha..."

Yang Can was rendered speechless. *Brother, did you even have a pillow?*

Oh, if the footstool under the edge of the bed counts as a pillow...

Well, when a husband's authority is not respected, this is the only way to "strengthen" himself.

As fellow men, it's the greatest kindness to see through it without exposing it.

As the two were talking, Laixi and Wangcai carried the two chests into the study.

Li Youcai boasted to Yang Can for a while about how considerate his young wife was to him, then left triumphantly with Laixi.

Yang Can had Wangcai brew a pot of tea and bring it to the study. He opened the two chests and took out all the account books and materials inside.

The account books were neatly arranged according to different manors, different categories, and the chronological order on their covers.

Yang Can had initially been worried that he wouldn't be able to understand them, but after opening the books and looking at them closely, he found them to be very simple.

Most account books in this era used single-entry bookkeeping, which recorded income and expenses in chronological order, commonly known as a "water account."

Slightly more complex account books used a "three-column" method, where income minus expenses equals the balance.

As for double-entry bookkeeping, even its embryonic forms, such as the "Dragon Gate Account" or the "Four-Legged Account," had not yet been invented in this era.

Therefore, with the modern knowledge he possessed, Yang Can only needed to slightly adapt to the era's accounting units, special terminology, and writing habits, and he could understand everything at a glance without needing anyone to teach him.

For example, an entry might read: "Fifth Voucher, Third Day of the Twelfth Lunar Month, received from Merchant Chen three taels and eight mace of silk payment silver. Paid, five mace of food and wages for the shop assistant."

Translated into vernacular, it would be: "Voucher #5, December 3rd, income from silk sales 3.8 taels, wage expense 0.5 taels."

Yang Can spent only about fifteen minutes to basically grasp the bookkeeping methods of these ledgers and the meaning of the various specialized terms on them.

Subsequently, he pulled over a sheet of paper, used a ruler to draw a table, and then began to fill it in item by item as he read.

As an ordinary person who had received a modern education, though he couldn't claim to be an expert in any field, he had dabbled in all of them.

With such simple and primitive account books, even if he wasn't an accountant, his methods for organizing and compiling statistics were far superior to those of the ancients.

The pastures and lands handed over by the Yu family's second branch had a single form of operation, making the tabulated accounts clear at a glance, and the statistics were very quick to compile.

In just over an hour, Yang Can had already organized several large volumes of account books. Through these statistics, he was gradually gaining an understanding of the properties he was about to control.

As a result, Yang Can now had a plan in mind; these accounts would not be a problem for him.

Yang Can gently tapped the table and pondered for a moment. Since he knew these accounts would not be difficult for him, there was no need to rush.

For now, he didn't want to quickly get a clear picture of the accounts because his future path and direction still depended on one matter being settled, which was...

Whether Su Chanzhi was pregnant.

Until this matter was confirmed, Yang Can would rather lie low and wait a bit longer.

Moreover, he had no intention of publicizing his method for organizing the accounts.

If this method were to spread, the best he could hope for was to be known as a remarkable accountant, bookkeeper, or finance advisor.

But his starting point was already higher than that, so there was no need.

Keeping his ability a secret would only make him seem more profound and unfathomable.

Furthermore, in the mind of his "good brother" Li Youcai, it would likely take Yang Can no less than a month or two just to sort out and clarify these accounts.

So, let Chief Steward Li make his mistaken judgment. This way, Yang Can could retain more initiative.

A sly smile appeared on Yang Can's face at the thought.

He locked his "statistical table," which was ahead of its time, inside a cabinet, hung the key on his belt, and casually scattered the other account books on his desk before walking out.

He planned to go find Steward Li and ask Li Damu to help organize the accounts, thus confirming his inability to manage them.

Li Damu readily agreed to Yang Can's request, let alone a request for help.

Yang Can was the Second Steward, his superior by rank, and it was only natural for him to assign Li Damu the task of organizing these accounts.

Li Damu said, "Rest assured, Steward Yang, this is within my duties.

However, the young mistress is currently sorting through the inner and outer accounts, so I dare not be negligent.

Once I have finished the tasks assigned by the young mistress, I will immediately go and sort out those accounts."

Yang Can smiled upon hearing this. "The six large manors and three great pastures don't all need to be sorted out at once.

Feng'an Manor is the closest to our Tianshui City. I'll have to trouble you, Mr. Li, to sort out the accounts for Feng'an Manor first."

Li Damu readily agreed and cheerfully saw Yang Can out of the accounting office.

He returned to his room and sat down, then pulled open the drawer beneath his desk.

Inside were two gold ingots, each weighing about half a catty.

Li Damu took one out, rubbing it with his thumb, and muttered to himself, "Second Steward Yang, it's not that I, Li, don't want to help you, but he offered simply too much..."

The "he" in Li Damu's mouth was none other than the manor master of Feng'an Manor, Zhang Yunyi.

Master Zhang had paid a visit today, arriving just a step ahead of Yang Can.
