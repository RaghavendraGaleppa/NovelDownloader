# Chapter 70: The Three Great Thunder Methods  

Han Yue nearly thought he had misheard!  

Five thousand three hundred and seventy-six perfect completions of the *Body-Nourishing Thunder*!  

Requiring the condensation of one million nine hundred sixty-two thousand two hundred and forty thunder-nurturing runes!  

Was this an achievement an *Entering the Body* realm cultivator could accomplish?  

With so many runic powers stacked together, even an *Entering the Body* cultivator's mana reserves would rival those of a *Longevity True Person*, wouldn't they?  

Seeing Han Yue's stunned expression, the **[Lineage Transmission]** True Person explained:  

"That's why I said examples of more than ten perfect completions have no reference value!"  

"This particular sect leader was the reincarnation of a *Longevity True Person* who failed to ascend to the fifth rank. At the moment of reincarnation, he transformed his nearly perfected blessed land into a companion spirit treasure and brought it with him."  

"That meant he possessed the mana source of a fourth-rank *Longevity True Person* while still in the *Entering the Body* realm!"  

"His cultivation was effortless. He spent less than ten years tempering himself in the *Entering the Body* realm before directly forming a first-grade Golden Core in seclusion—and that was only because he deliberately suppressed his cultivation to pursue perfection!"  

"Those five thousand three hundred and seventy-six perfect completions took him just over three thousand two hundred days. Had he not suddenly formed his Golden Core, the number could have kept rising!"  

Han Yue broke out in a cold sweat as he listened. The Divine Thunder Palace was full of cheaters! His understanding of his own standing within the sect deepened.  

This place was a breeding ground for all kinds of prodigies and powerhouses—it was best to keep a low profile!  

Han Yue decided that from now on, he would be extra courteous and kind to others within the sect.  

The **[Lineage Transmission]** True Person continued:  

"Those five thousand three hundred and seventy-six perfect completions helped that True Person comprehend five supreme divine abilities upon his breakthrough, truly reaching the limit!"  

"However, aside from that sect leader, there have only been three disciples who achieved more than fifty perfect completions, each comprehending four supreme divine abilities."  

"From this perspective, his additional five thousand plus perfect completions only granted him one extra divine ability."  

"For you, Yuanchu, with your two refining divine abilities, it would be worthwhile to cultivate this *Body-Nourishing Thunder* thoroughly!"  

"I recommend you strive for at least five perfect completions of *Body-Nourishing Thunder* and attempt to form a first-grade Golden Core."  

"Of course, your cultivation itself should remain the priority. You must weigh your options carefully!"  

"After all, even if you comprehend multiple supreme divine abilities, it would all be in vain if you fail to attain longevity."  

Han Yue still had thirty-one years before turning sixty.  

As long as he formed an upper-third-grade Golden Core within those thirty-one years, he could become a true disciple of the Divine Thunder Palace!  

---  

Time was still on his side. After obtaining the inheritance, he would need to carefully consider his cultivation path.  

At this point, only one test remained. After scanning Han Yue's dantian, the **[Lineage Transmission]** True Person made the final record.  

"*The Supreme Cave True Thunder Demon-Slaying Sword* and *The Nine Heavens Refining Dao Dharma-Protecting Dutian Seal*—you’ve successfully nurtured two lineage-based Dao artifacts."  

"In forging these Dao artifacts, you’ve outpaced most!"  

"In the last ten thousand years, aside from reincarnated individuals or descendants of great cultivators who came prepared, disciples who forged two Dao artifacts in the *Entering the Body* realm can be counted on one hand!"  

"No wonder Tianyun said you were possessed by the God of Wealth, exceptionally skilled in managing resources."  

With the final entry complete, the **[Lineage Transmission]** True Person finished all assessments of Han Yue.  

Everything had proceeded smoothly, and the True Person now had a clear understanding of Han Yue’s talents.  

He spoke:  

"Yuanchu, now that the assessment is complete, you are officially a disciple!"  

"Our Divine Thunder Palace has few members and little red tape."  

"As for sect rules, aside from prohibiting infighting and indiscriminate killing of innocents, we are practically unrestrained. You’ll come to understand this as you cultivate."  

"Detailed information about the sect is included in the inheritance. Study it at your leisure."  

"As for your cultivation, I’ve already formed a preliminary understanding. Though I’ve mentioned many outstanding figures from our sect’s history, your aptitude is among the finest in this world."  

"Maintain a steady mindset, cultivate diligently, and you will surely achieve greatness!"  

The Divine Thunder Palace’s history was vast, and with **[Lineage Transmission]** as its living encyclopedia, no matter how talented a newcomer was, he could always cite even more exceptional figures from the past to temper their pride.  

In truth, those figures were once-in-a-millennium prodigies.  

Han Yue’s talent, enhanced by the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws*, had already left **[Lineage Transmission]** thoroughly satisfied!  

Given time, the Divine Thunder Palace would gain another seed of longevity, another true prodigy!  

"Your mastery of *Body-Nourishing Thunder* is profound, and you’ve forged two lineage-based artifacts. Ninety percent of your future path is already set!"  

The **[Lineage Transmission]** True Person began detailing the sect’s longevity inheritance.  

"Of the Divine Thunder Palace’s seven great longevity inheritance methods, four are supreme traditions that reach the fifth rank!"  

"Aside from the *Mystic Origin Commanding Heavenly River True Spirit Jade Tome*, which focuses on the Heavenly River’s orthodox method and the Great Dao of True Water—unsuitable for you—"  

"The other three thunder methods are all viable for you:  

1. *The Supreme Divine Thunder Primordial Magnetism Longevity Scripture*  
2. *The Great Freedom Transforming Thunder Secret Record*  
3. *The Supreme Cave Purple Jade North Star Thunder Scripture*."  

"These three methods are all profound in their exposition of thunder techniques, with no clear superiority."  

"They merely emphasize different aspects of the Great Dao."  

"These three methods branch from the Great Dao of Thunder into the paths of Primordial Magnetism, Transformation, and Stars—all profound truths passed down from celestial beings."  

"Given your thunder foundation, any of these would suit you perfectly. The choice is yours to make based on preference."  

"Aside from the orthodox inheritance, you already possess all the essential body-refining and foundation-building techniques for the *Entering the Body* realm, so no additional selections are needed."  

"Additionally, you may choose three divine ability techniques—a privilege for new disciples."  

"Normally, I’d recommend *Entwined Thunder Robe* and *Minor Thunder Sound Art*, two essential techniques for our sect’s disciples."  

"*Entwined Thunder Robe* is cultivated through thread armor and is one of the most cost-effective protective divine abilities. It’s best mastered before advancing to the second rank."  

"This way, you can refine the ability to perfection during your breakthrough, solidifying it within yourself."  

"*Minor Thunder Sound Art* is a communication technique among Divine Thunder Palace disciples, essential for daily life within the sect!"  

"However, since your master has already taught you *Entwined Thunder Robe*, you may choose another divine ability."  

"Follow this path to its end, and you’ll reach the **[Hall of New Knowledge]**. Everything you need is inside—go and retrieve it."  

The **[Lineage Transmission]** True Person pointed the way.  

Seizing the opportunity, Han Yue asked:  

"**[Lineage Transmission]** Patriarch, my cultivation has been entirely self-guided through *Body-Nourishing Thunder*, leaving many gaps in knowledge and common sense. Are there ways to remedy this?"  

"The sect has already considered this. You’ll understand once you reach the **[Hall of New Knowledge]**!"
