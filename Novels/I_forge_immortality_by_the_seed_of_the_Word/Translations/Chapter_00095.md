**Chapter 93: The Restoration of Dao-Inducing Spiritual Light**  

**Day Five**  

Whoosh—  

A blizzard spanning dozens of miles roared and howled, whipping up sand and stones like a frenzied beast bent on destroying everything in its path.  

At the forefront of this storm, a long river—its head and tail seemingly vanishing into the void—stretched across the sky, surging forward at breakneck speed.  

Clang! Clang!  

The crisp metallic clashing sounds, which had once resembled a musical composition, now carried an unmistakable urgency.  

And atop this river stood a young figure clad in blue robes.  

"Damn it! You were the ones who provoked me first. So what if I killed twenty-something of your monkey kin? Was it really necessary to chase me down like this?" Zhang Jing cursed under his breath.  

He stood lightly atop the Five Treasures Spirit River, his feet barely touching the surface as his robes fluttered in the wind, giving him an almost ethereal appearance.  

Of course, that was if one ignored his slightly disheveled state.  

Through the clear waters of the spirit river, the scenery below blurred past at an incredible speed.  

This was a new technique Zhang Jing had developed while fleeing—his "Spirit River Escape Art"—which was several times faster than simply using spiritual energy to form a rainbow bridge.  

Yet even with this speed, it provided only the faintest sense of security.  

Zhang Jing couldn't help but glance back.  

In his line of sight, the blizzard raged relentlessly behind him.  

Through the swirling snow, he could vaguely make out a towering humanoid shadow, over a dozen zhang tall.  

Zhang Jing knew it wasn’t human—it was a white ape, its body as hard as diamond, possessing monstrous strength, and capable of summoning blizzards with a mere wave of its hand.  

In the frozen wasteland of the Third Empyrean, this creature was practically invincible.  

And it had been chasing him for two full days.  

The trouble had started three days prior.  

At the time, Zhang Jing had been aimlessly searching for spirit beasts, hoping to accumulate more spiritual essence before his Dao-Inducing Spiritual Light recovered, so he could exchange it for additional time to comprehend Dao Intent.  

After all, opportunities like this were rare.  

But as he passed through a valley, a boulder the size of a house suddenly struck him from the sky.  

Stabilizing himself, he traced the source of the attack—only to find a group of white apes, each standing about a zhang tall, baring their teeth at him with greedy, predatory eyes.  

As the saying goes, *just when you’ve searched everywhere in vain, fortune arrives by chance.*  

Spirit beasts were already scarce in the frozen wasteland, making them difficult to find. Zhang Jing had been racking his brain over it—who would’ve thought they’d come to him instead?  

Who could resist such a temptation?  

Without hesitation, he struck.  

The apes were strong, each nearly as powerful as the guardian spirit gods of the Twentieth Heavenly Stair.  

But under the full might of his Five Treasures Spirit River, they were no match.  

To his delight, Zhang Jing discovered that killing one ape yielded **150 spiritual essence!**  

After some hard work, he had amassed over **3,000 spiritual essence** in total.  

But the commotion had also attracted something far worse—the monstrous white ape now hunting him down.  

Returning to the present, Zhang Jing analyzed the situation.  

"This thing is at least twice as strong as that armored man from the Twenty-Fourth Stair. Based on the patterns of the previous two Empyreans, that likely means it’s even stronger than the guardian spirit god of the Ninth Heavenly Stair in the Third Empyrean."  

He had spent these two days of being chased learning everything he could about his pursuer.  

And now, he was utterly baffled.  

*How is this fair?*  

*If you’re this strong, why not just take the guardian spirit god’s place on the Twenty-Seventh Stair?*  

The words of the giant cloud infant echoed in his mind:  

*"Some spirit beasts may bring unexpected rewards when slain."*  

Zhang Jing was certain now—this monstrous white ape was one of those special spirit beasts.  

Unfortunately, while he had the will to slay it, he lacked the strength.  

What could he do?  

---  

Meanwhile, in the Second Empyrean.  

A flash of light appeared, revealing a graceful figure—Qin Nian, who had just returned from the Ten Thousand Treasures Repository.  

Without delay, she soared upward, challenging the Heavenly Stairs once more.  

Before long, she landed, exhaustion flickering in her eyes.  

She had reached the **Eighteenth Stair**—just one step away from the Third Empyrean.  

A trace of excitement crossed her delicate features.  

"Who would’ve thought that the **Spiritual Enlightenment Bodhi Fruit** obtained from slaying that spirit beast would be so potent? Though the Dao Intent comprehension lasted only six breaths, it increased my Dao Rhyme by **10%**—just **20%** short of perfection now."  

The memory of that spirit beast sent a shiver down her spine.  

It had been terrifyingly powerful.  

If not for sheer luck, she might have been the one who died.  

Though she could revive by spending **10 spiritual essence**, death wasn’t something anyone wanted to experience.  

Suddenly remembering something, she quickly checked the Spiritual Essence Ranking through the Dao Mark on her palm.  

*Phew—*  

Seeing that Zhang Jing was still stuck on the **Twenty-Fourth Stair**, she exhaled in relief.  

*Good, he hasn’t moved yet.*  

Her gaze shifted to the remaining Spiritual Enlightenment Bodhi Fruit in her hand.  

Clenching her fist, she steeled herself.  

"Qin Nian, you’ve got to push harder! With this last fruit, gather more spiritual essence. Next time you enter the Ten Thousand Treasures Repository, aim to perfect your Dao Rhyme and enter the Third Empyrean as soon as possible!"  

Truth be told, ever since Zhang Jing had stormed into the Third Empyrean and claimed the Twenty-Fourth Stair, Qin Nian had abandoned any thought of competing with him.  

Her only goal now was to reach the Third Empyrean as quickly as possible.  

As the top disciple of the Divine Firmament Outer Court, she had her own pride.  

If she couldn’t compete with Zhang Jing, so be it.  

But as a fellow outer court disciple—and an elite **Grade-A** one at that—she couldn’t afford to lag behind in a different Empyrean.  

At the very least, it would sound better when word got out.  

Otherwise, how could she face the senior disciples of the inner court—or the junior disciples who looked up to her?  

*"Damn Zhang Jing! Why couldn’t we all just quietly be geniuses together?"*  

The thought made her grit her teeth in frustration.  

---  

**Two Days Later**  

Feeling the Dao-Inducing Spiritual Light in his mind fully restored, Zhang Jing couldn’t help but grin.  

He checked his palm.  

**[Spiritual Essence: 10,610]**  

Satisfied, he vanished—along with the massive, multicolored ice cube beneath him.  

Each side of the cube shimmered in hues of red, orange, cyan, blue, purple, and black.  

Inside the Ten Thousand Treasures Repository, the right gate creaked open.  

But Zhang Jing didn’t enter. Instead, he stood outside and called out,  

"Elder Infant! Come out—I’ve got something fun for you!"  

A small head peeked out from behind the door.  

"Oh? It’s you, young man. You’ve brought me a toy?"  

The Infant Elder floated out, landing gracefully before the enormous six-colored ice cube.  

It tilted its head in confusion.  

"What is this?"  

Zhang Jing grinned.  

"Elder Infant, this is a little invention of mine. I call it the **‘Transforming Cube’**! Let me explain how it works..."  

And so, he began explaining the rules—essentially introducing the concept of a **Rubik’s Cube** to the Infant Elder.  

Except this one had **3,333 layers** instead of the usual three.  

It had taken him half a day to craft.
