# Chapter 10 Investigation

The leather waist pouch was small. Li Shiming tried to open it but discovered the opening was fake—there was no actual way to open it. This only reinforced his belief that the pouch must be an item related to cultivation. With a slight thought, he stored the pouch into his machine room space.

"Young Master, this place is dangerous. Please wait elsewhere while we investigate, and we'll report our findings to you afterward!" Guard Zhang arrived with a group of guards and hurriedly approached when he saw Li Shiming had already reached the scene.

"Alright, I'll go see my father," Li Shiming nodded in agreement.

This wasn't a simple matter of inspection—government constables would arrive to investigate and compile a report for submission.

Li Wenyuan, who was working in the government office, immediately inquired about Li Shiming's safety upon hearing of the explosion. Only after confirming his son was unharmed did he relax. He didn't rush to the scene, leaving the investigation to professionals. His presence would require an entourage, which might disturb the evidence.

When Li Shiming arrived at Li Wenyuan's office, he found his father pacing anxiously, clearly troubled.

"Shiming, you're here. That must have been quite a shock," Li Wenyuan said with a forced smile upon seeing him.

"Father, I went to see the scene. The destruction there isn't something an ordinary person could have caused," Li Shiming replied calmly with a bow.

Li Wenyuan was pleased with his son's composure but still disapproved of him visiting the scene. "A gentleman does not stand beneath a collapsing wall. In situations like this, let the subordinates investigate first. Only go when it's confirmed safe."

"Yes, Father," Li Shiming acknowledged.

"If it's beyond human capability, then it must be the work of that cultivator. I just don't understand why they'd cause such a commotion in the garden," Li Wenyuan mused.

"How will this be handled?" Li Shiming asked curiously about the official response to matters involving cultivators.

"I've already sent an urgent report to the capital. Affairs concerning cultivators are handled by them. Fortunately, since this involves cultivation, I won't face serious repercussions. Otherwise, given recent events, I'd be in deep trouble." Li Wenyuan shook his head, thinking of the recent massacre of over thirty people and now this incident within the government compound. Under normal circumstances, his position as prefect would be at risk. But with cultivators involved, it was beyond human control, and the government couldn't be blamed for incompetence.

"Will the capital send cultivators?" Li Shiming pressed.

"Cultivators aren't at the beck and call of the capital. We've never encountered this situation before—who knows?" Li Wenyuan couldn't provide a definitive answer.

After a while, Constable Zheng arrived.

"Greetings, Prefect, Young Master," Constable Zheng entered the room with measured steps and bowed to both.

Li Wenyuan nodded slightly, while Li Shiming returned the greeting with a scholar's courtesy. This was Li Shiming's first proper meeting with Constable Zheng, the foremost martial expert in Nanling Prefecture. The constable exuded an oppressive aura that made Li Shiming uncomfortable, prompting Zheng to quickly suppress it. He had been unable to contain his anger upon hearing about the incident in the garden.

"Constable Zheng, any leads?" Li Wenyuan asked gravely.

"Prefect, I was just about to report. The coroner found fragmented remains of flesh and blood, along with pieces of unusually resilient white cloth." Constable Zheng handed over a small fragment of white fabric.

Li Wenyuan examined the cloth—about the size of a palm, its edges charred black as if burned. It appeared ordinary at first glance. "What makes this cloth special?" he asked, knowing neither the constable nor the coroner would lie.

"Prefect, may I draw my blade?" Constable Zheng requested with a bow. Drawing weapons in the prefect's office required permission.

"Granted," Li Wenyuan waved his hand.

Constable Zheng unsheathed his sword and pressed it against the cloth. With a slight exertion, the blade slid over the fabric without cutting through. Li Wenyuan's expression turned serious without needing further explanation. Though not a legendary weapon, Constable Zheng's blade was far from ordinary—even a casual stroke should have sliced regular cloth cleanly. This seemingly plain fabric possessed extraordinary resistance.

"We suspect this fragment comes from the white-robed man at Tianxiang Tower that day. I also examined the flesh at the scene—it contained an inexplicable energy, entirely different from that of martial artists. This supports our conclusion," Constable Zheng continued.

Li Shiming marveled inwardly at the talent in Nanling Prefecture. In such a short time, they had pieced together most of the truth from the scene.

"So, someone killed the white-robed man in the garden?" Li Wenyuan asked, staring at the cloth with disbelief. He found it hard to accept—he was certain the white-robed man was a cultivator, and cultivators weren't supposed to die so easily. After all, the seven escorts and the grandmaster-level chief escort of Weiyuan Escort Agency had been utterly powerless against him.

"Prefect, this is the shared conclusion of myself and the coroner. We will submit a detailed report shortly," Constable Zheng affirmed.

"Could it be the white-robed man had an enemy? Is there another cultivator in Nanling Prefecture?" Li Wenyuan muttered, puzzled.

Li Shiming remained silent. There were too many inexplicable details, and he couldn't reveal his involvement to his father. He thought of Chief Escort Wang's corpse—he needed to find a place to dispose of it soon. Keeping it in his machine room space was unsettling. Though he had acquired the *Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique*, *Introduction to Runes*, and the small wooden sword, he hadn't studied them yet, fearing the cultivator might detect his probing. Now that the cultivator was dead, he planned to examine his gains upon returning.

"Shiming, the compound will be noisy these next few days. I'll try to keep them away from your courtyard so your studies aren't disturbed. You seem tired—go rest," Li Wenyuan said, noticing his son's distracted demeanor and assuming he was still shaken.

Li Shiming took his leave. Now that the authorities knew of the cultivator's death, there would be no further complications in handling the aftermath.

The entire city of Nanling had been affected by the explosion. Government runners were dispatched to reassure the public, while soldiers patrolled the streets, placing the city under martial law.
