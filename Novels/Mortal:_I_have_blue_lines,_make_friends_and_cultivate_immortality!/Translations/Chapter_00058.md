# Chapter 58: Ancestor Nangong! What Are You Doing? Stop! (1/3)

[Ding, Nangong Wan has sent you a friend request.]

[Ding, Nangong Wan has become your friend. You can draw two rewards from Nangong Wan.]

[Ding, congratulations on obtaining Vermilion Bird Bloodstone.]

[Treasure Description: A legendary object tainted by the true blood of the divine Vermilion Bird, possessing extremely high fire-attribute spiritual energy. It serves as the foundation for refining the Vermilion Bird Ring and was picked up by Nangong Wan in the mountains.]

[Ding, congratulations on obtaining a fire-attribute Heavenly Spiritual Root.]

[Treasure Description: A spiritual root with an extremely high affinity for fire-attribute spiritual energy.]

"Huh? Seriously? She just picked it up? How is that even possible?" Lin Yun twitched his lips as he read the system's notifications. Nangong Wan's luck always seemed to be ridiculously good. 

When she ascended to the Spirit Realm later, she even stumbled upon two intact true spirit corpses.

While Lin Yun was still grumbling internally, Nangong Wan on the other side was already struggling to hold on.

"Hurry up and help me! Otherwise, I'll really possess this Black Flood Dragon and take you down with me!" Nangong Wan shrieked angrily.

"Coming, coming! I'm on my way!" Lin Yun controlled the Giant Tortoise Shield and True Wood Shield to knock the Black Flood Dragon away.

"Not having a proper top-grade offensive magical tool is such a pain. I still have to rely on shields for attacks. After reaching Foundation Establishment this time, I'll have to commission someone to forge a few proper weapons. I also need to keep improving my Vajra Art!" Lin Yun thought to himself.

After the Black Flood Dragon was sent flying by Lin Yun's shields, Nangong Wan finally exhaled in relief.

Watching the retreating Black Flood Dragon, Lin Yun took out three Heavenly Thunder Beads.

"Three should be enough," Lin Yun estimated the destructive power of the beads.

Just as he was about to use them to blow up the Black Flood Dragon, a thought suddenly struck him—the flood dragon's materials seemed quite valuable. More importantly, he could toss them to Han Li to farm rewards.

Additionally, since he cultivated the Vajra Art as a body cultivator, this was the perfect opportunity for close combat to temper his physique. The Black Flood Dragon was an ideal sparring partner, and he might even be able to break through to the third layer of the Vajra Art during this fight.

With that in mind, Lin Yun put away the Heavenly Thunder Beads.

From a distance, Nangong Wan opened her eyes in confusion. "Why didn't you just blow it up?"

Lin Yun grinned with interest. "Its materials are valuable, and the cultivation technique I practice happens to need a punching bag."

With that, Lin Yun stomped forward, leaped, and punched the Black Flood Dragon squarely in the abdomen.

"ROAR—"

The Black Flood Dragon's eyes bulged out as excruciating pain sent it into a frenzy. It immediately charged at Lin Yun.

By now, the Black Flood Dragon was no longer the fierce beast it had been at the start. It had been bombarded by Nangong Wan's treasures, pummeled by the Moon Mask Sect disciples' spells, blasted by Lin Yun's talismans, and even struck by Heavenly Thunder Beads.

It was already at the end of its rope—after all, it was only a second-tier demonic beast.

In contrast, Lin Yun had mostly relied on talismans in battle, preserving his stamina and remaining in peak condition.

"BOOM—"

Lin Yun crossed his arms in front of his chest as the Black Flood Dragon slammed into him. With a muffled grunt, he was sent flying backward.

But he quickly recovered, jumping back to punch the Black Flood Dragon in the head before grabbing its tail, spinning it around, and hurling it with all his might.

"CRASH—"

The Black Flood Dragon smashed into the cavern wall, stars dancing in its vision.

"Is this guy really a cultivator? His physical strength is absurd!"

"Did he cultivate some legendary body-refining technique?"

"But human cultivators practicing body-refining arts was something from tens of thousands of years ago, back when the Spirit Realm wasn't as depleted in spiritual energy and resources as it is now. Back then, even Five Spiritual Roots were as coveted as Heavenly Spiritual Roots by major sects."

"Nowadays, while there are still some physically strong cultivators, most are Buddhist monks or those who use secret techniques to reinforce their bodies with magic power. But this guy seems to be purely physically strong!"

After about fifteen minutes, the Black Flood Dragon let out a final wail before its battered body collapsed.

"This exhilarating feeling!" Lin Yun clenched his fists excitedly. "This is the rush I've been looking for!"

"I can already see the third layer of the Vajra Art!"

"He actually beat the Black Flood Dragon to death?!" Nangong Wan clicked her tongue in amazement. "What a terrifying guy."

She then walked over, pulling out a small crystal vial from her storage pouch. Murmuring an incantation, she pointed at the Black Flood Dragon, and several thin strands of black mist slithered out from the vial, coiling around the corpse.

Moments later, a miniature green flood dragon—identical in form to the original—was forcibly extracted from the corpse by the black mist. Despite its furious struggles, it was gradually dragged into the vial.

After sealing the vial and examining the tiny flood dragon inside, she offered it to Lin Yun.

"You can have it if you want. I'm not interested in this thing," Lin Yun waved dismissively.

"In that case, thank you." Nangong Wan's eyes curved into crescents, her face alight with joy. 

Instantly, her impression of Lin Yun improved significantly.

"This guy isn't so bad after all."

As for the fallen Moon Mask Sect disciples, Nangong Wan could only say that the law of the jungle prevailed in the cultivation world. If so many of them couldn't defeat Lin Yun alone, who could they blame?

Maybe in their next life, after growing stronger, they could seek revenge on Lin Yun or Elder Qiong.

Even she, a Core Formation cultivator, had nearly died at the hands of a mere second-tier demonic beast today—how much worse could it be for ordinary disciples?

Just then, as the Black Flood Dragon's body lay in tatters, a bloodstained spherical object rolled out from a wound in its abdomen.

"Huh? Is that a demon core?" Nangong Wan curiously picked it up. "But I thought Black Flood Dragons only form cores at the third tier?"

Having lived in the demon-scarce South Heaven Region, Nangong Wan had only heard of demon cores but never seen one—especially since she had only recently reached Core Formation herself.

"Hmm—this core feels soft? And why is it red? Shouldn't a Black Flood Dragon's core be blue?" Nangong Wan wiped the blood off the sphere, puzzled.

"Wait—could it be—?" Nangong Wan suddenly realized something and tried to throw it away, but in the next instant, the sphere burst open on its own, releasing a thick pink mist that enveloped her.

Lin Yun was in the middle of changing clothes—his battle with the Black Flood Dragon had ruined his Greenwood Robe, which was only a standard top-grade magical tool.

But the next second, he felt a pair of cold little hands climbing onto his shoulders, pressing against him.

"Ancestor Nangong! What are you doing?!"

"No—"

"Stop—"

[Ding, Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light +1.]

[Ding, Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light +1.]

[Ding, Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light +1.]

By the fourth day...

Nangong Wan felt like her bones had been shattered. She now understood exactly how the Black Flood Dragon had felt.

Too terrifying!

Too horrifying!

"What happened between us was just a dream!" Nangong Wan glared coldly at Lin Yun.

"Uh-huh, sure, sure! Absolutely!"

"You're so noble! So righteous!"

"Put on your clothes and suddenly you don't recognize me anymore. If you hadn't kept pulling me back and begging me not to stop, I would've left ages ago," Lin Yun muttered.

"Shut your nonsense!" Nangong Wan snapped, her face burning with embarrassment.

Just as she turned to reprimand him, her foot slipped, sending her tumbling back into Lin Yun's arms—right onto his lap.

Lin Yun stared at her. "Was that an accident... or on purpose?"
