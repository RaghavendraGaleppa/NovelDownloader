# Chapter 16: You Think You're Talented? Just a Pathetic Loser!

"Zhou Qingning, dual wood and metal spiritual roots, passed."
"Qi Yun, dual fire and earth spiritual roots, passed."
"Tang Minghua, dual metal and fire spiritual roots, passed."
"Qian Huan, dual metal and earth spiritual roots, passed."
"Han Yunzhi, wood and metal spiritual roots, passed."
"Fire and wood dual spiritual roots, passed."
"Earth and wood dual spiritual roots, passed."

In the ten years since the last Ascension Assembly, quite a few dual spiritual root cultivators had emerged among the loose cultivators—now numbering over thirty. Yet compared to the thousands present, this ratio remained pitifully small.

After a while, the spiritual root testing for the large group of cultivators was nearly complete. Han Li, seeing that no one else seemed to be rushing forward, felt eager to try. He was deeply curious about his own spiritual root potential.

Perhaps he was that one-in-ten-thousand cultivation prodigy? Maybe he would be the next Heavenly Spiritual Root holder? 

But just as Han Li reached for the spirit orb, a swirling wind sphere shot toward him. His pupils dilated in shock—it was too late to dodge. Regret filled his heart. Why had he been so stubborn? If only he had accepted Brother Lin's defensive artifact, he might have been protected.

The wind sphere struck his abdomen, the violent twisting pain making his vision blur as he collapsed. Someone immediately stepped on his back to leap past him, their arrogant voice ringing out: "You're not next in line!"

Han Li recognized him—the same arrogant cultivator who had snatched his damaged magic treasure earlier.

"Wind-type Variant Spiritual Root, passed!"

The surrounding loose cultivators gasped in awe and envy at the announcement. "A Variant Spiritual Root? This year's assembly is truly extraordinary!"

Basking in their admiration, Lu Yunfeng cast a dark look toward Lin Yun before taunting, "How boring. This was child's play for me!" His gaze then locked onto Lin Yun. "You there, scared out of your wits, aren't you? Your spiritual roots must be pathetic."

"What a petty, vindictive person. Is the cultivation world full of such trash?" Han Li muttered in frustration as Lin Yun helped him up. The pain in his abdomen made him grimace.

"Brother Han, take this healing pill first. That guy is targeting me," Lin Yun said, handing him a bottle.

Han Li didn't refuse—Lin Yun's pills were far superior to the ones he had refined in the mortal world. The injury was severe; his internal organs felt displaced.

"Brother Lin, this man holds grudges. We both need to be careful," Han Li warned. The hostility wasn't solely directed at Lin Yun—he was likely on the hit list too.

**[Ding! Host has gifted Han Li a healing pill, triggering 'Give a Plum, Receive a Peach' effect.]**  
**[Ding! Congratulations, host has obtained Qi Refining Powder x10.]**  
**[Treasure Description: Qi Refining Powder, an ancient Foundation Establishment pill refined by Han Li. Potent effects.]**  

Just then, the spirit orb, now infused with wind-attributed spiritual energy, shot toward them. Lin Yun flicked his sleeve, halting it mid-air. Han Li touched it, revealing four colors: green (wood), red (fire), blue (water), and yellow (earth).

"Water, earth, fire, wood—four spiritual roots. Failed," announced Nangong Wan dispassionately.

Han Li's expression darkened. Though he had suspected his aptitude might be poor, he hadn't expected to possess a False Spiritual Root. Mocking laughter erupted around him.

"A False Spiritual Root dares to attend the Ascension Assembly?"  
"How shameless!"  

With a sigh, Han Li handed the orb to Lin Yun. Upon contact, a fifth color—gold (metal)—appeared alongside the previous four.

"Metal, wood, water, fire, earth—five spiritual roots. Failed." Nangong Wan's voice held a hint of surprise. While four-rooted False Spiritual Roots were common, five-rooted ones like Lin Yun's were rare—the only one today.

"Five spiritual roots? Unbelievable!"  
"What a joke!"  

Strangely, Han Li felt slightly better knowing Lin Yun's roots were worse than his. It was like failing an exam with 59 points, only to discover your friend scored 58.

Lin Yun, unfazed, tossed the orb back. Unlike four-rooted False Spiritual Roots, five-rooted ones were uncommon—a fact Han Li would later learn from the Divine Condensation Beast's teachings. Many ancient and powerful cultivation techniques, even in the Spirit Realm, required five spiritual roots. For instance, during Han Li's first auction in Tianyuan City, a late-Nascent Soul cultivation method—"Yin-Yang Polar Art"—sold for 40 million spirit stones, with the strict requirement of five spiritual roots.

Lin Yun's roots weren't inherently inferior—they simply didn't suit the current human realm's cultivation environment.

Nangong Wan surveyed the crowd. "This concludes today's spiritual root testing."

"What a lackluster assembly. The worst I've seen," a Golden Core elder from the Great Sword Sect remarked.

Before the crowd could disperse, Lu Yunfeng blocked the exit, glaring at Lin Yun and Han Li. "Well, well! The infamous five-rooted trash! Did you think you could leave?"

Han Li glanced at the Golden Core elders, but Lu Yunfeng sneered, "The assembly's over. No one protects False Spiritual Root trash like you now."

Chen Qiaoqian moved to intervene, but a Foundation Establishment cultivator barred her way. "Junior Sister Chen, Yunfeng can handle these two. No need for you to interfere."

"Brother Han, stay back. Let me handle this," Lin Yun said, pulling Han Li aside as Lu Yunfeng summoned his top-grade artifact—the Azure Serpent Banner. A torrent of razor-sharp wind blades surged toward them.

"Layers of talismans?!" The crowd gasped as Lin Yun unleashed dozens of low-grade talismans, neutralizing the attack effortlessly.

"Impressive for a loose cultivator," a Golden Core elder murmured, intrigued by Lin Yun's seemingly endless supply.

Dong Xuan'er's eyes widened. "How does a mere loose cultivator have so many talismans?"

Lu Yunfeng paled. "Impossible!"

Lin Yun smirked. "Listen well, brat. The cultivation world isn't about comparing spiritual roots like children. Talent means nothing without resources and strength!" 

"You think a top-grade artifact makes you special? You're just a pathetic loser!" 

"Wind Spiritual Root? Big deal! You're nothing but a fraud!"

The crowd erupted. Some, like Zhou Qingning, scoffed at Lin Yun's audacity. Others, like Dong Xuan'er, found his boldness thrilling. 

"How dare a five-rooted trash look down on a Variant Spiritual Root?" someone spat. 

But Lin Yun didn't care. He had a lesson to teach.
