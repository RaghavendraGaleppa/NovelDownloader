# Chapter 93: Instantly Killing a Foundation Establishment Cultivator

Yuan Niya, a disciple with such immense potential, was undoubtedly a major obstacle to their future plans of dismantling Qinglu Sect. Therefore, eliminating these talented disciples in advance had become He Shaogang's current mission.

However, this year's True Disciple Trial had unprecedented protective measures. According to the intelligence he had gathered, the sect would assign a Foundation Establishment-level deacon to secretly protect each of the top-ranked participating disciples. Additionally, a Golden Core elder skilled in escape techniques would oversee the trial.

If the protecting deacons encountered dangers they couldn't handle, they could summon the overseeing Golden Core elder for support.

Qinglu Sect's preparations caught He Shaogang off guard. Based on his intelligence from previous True Disciple Trials, there had never been such stringent protective measures before.

In past trials, when Qinglu Sect still had Nascent Soul cultivators overseeing them, they naturally feared no dangers. But times had changed. With the sect having lost its Nascent Soul ancestor, if any True Disciple candidates were to meet with misfortune now, Qinglu Sect would completely lose its future.

Under these circumstances, Qinglu Sect naturally increased the protection level for this True Disciple Trial, especially for the top-ranked disciples.

The heightened protection for participating disciples created significant obstacles for He Shaogang's assassination plans. If they were to proceed with forced assassinations, the cost would be enormous and might even alert their enemies.

Therefore, He Shaogang had to abandon large-scale assassination plans and instead focus on the few most valuable inner sect disciples.

Yuan Niya was the top target on He Shaogang's assassination list. However, the higher the ranking, the stronger the sect's protective measures, making the assassination more difficult.

But when He Shaogang discovered that Gu Mo had become Yuan Niya's assistant for this True Disciple Trial, he nearly laughed out loud in delight.

Having a mole right beside the target would drastically reduce the difficulty of this assassination mission. Even if all other missions failed, as long as they could eliminate Yuan Niya—the target with the greatest potential—this operation would be considered a success.

"Greetings, Senior Brother He!"

He Shaogang's sudden greeting took Gu Mo by surprise. This senior brother had once invited Gu Mo to become his follower, but Gu Mo had politely declined.

Gu Mo had thought this refusal might have offended the sect master's personal disciple, but now it seemed He Shaogang didn't mind at all. In fact, his tone even carried a hint of friendliness.

"I had originally planned to invite Junior Brother Gu Mo to be my assistant for this True Disciple Trial, but it seems Senior Sister Yuan got to you first," He Shaogang said with a smile.

His words immediately drew the attention of everyone around them, all curious about what kind of person could attract invitations from the two hottest geniuses in the sect.

"Junior Brother He, this senior sister still needs to draw her trial mission, so I'll take my leave first."

Hearing He Shaogang openly try to poach her assistant, Yuan Niya was displeased. Without giving Gu Mo a chance to respond, she pulled him and Chu Feifei away.

Watching the three depart, He Shaogang maintained his smile. The more importance Yuan Niya showed toward Gu Mo, the smoother his assassination plan would proceed.

...

"Niya-jie, what mission did you get?" Chu Feifei asked as Yuan Niya returned from drawing her assignment.

Depending on the mission's content, they could make appropriate preparations.

"Let's find a place to talk!"

Yuan Niya glanced around before heading to a quiet room in the mission hall—a space specifically designated for sect disciples to discuss mission details.

"Hehehe!"

Once inside, Yuan Niya finally let a grin spread across her face. Clearly, the drawing had gone well. Without keeping them in suspense, she handed a small booklet to Gu Mo and Chu Feifei, which contained the details of her assigned True Disciple Trial mission.

"It's a mission to eliminate evil cultivators," Gu Mo summarized after skimming through the booklet.

The mission stated that in recent years, evil cultivators had been appearing in remote mortal villages, slaughtering ordinary people to cultivate forbidden techniques. Qinglu Sect had dispatched many disciples to eliminate them, but with no success. Each time the sect's forces withdrew, the evil cultivators would resume their activities.

After several failed attempts, the sect grew increasingly frustrated. They had even sent out peak Qi Condensation disciples and Foundation Establishment cultivators, but still failed to capture the targets.

However, the evil cultivators had gone quiet for a while after those operations—until recently, when they resumed their activities. The sect had now classified this troublesome mission as a True Disciple Trial task.

This was undoubtedly one of the more difficult missions in the trial. But with higher difficulty came higher evaluations upon completion. For powerful inner sect disciples, challenging missions were exactly what they wanted—ordinary tasks couldn't showcase their true capabilities.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, Feifei, just watch as your senior sister pummels those evil cultivators!" Yuan Niya clenched her small fists. A combat mission like this was clearly right up her alley.

However, Gu Mo believed the real challenge of this mission lay in locating the evil cultivators. The fact that the sect had sent multiple teams without success suggested the evil cultivators had excellent intelligence networks—they might even have moles within the sect itself.

The thought of moles made Gu Mo's heart sink slightly. He recalled that evil cultivator who had been watching him—the one who seemed to be hiding within the sect.

If this mission was connected to that hidden evil cultivator, the difficulty would be much higher than anticipated.

But the current Gu Mo was no longer that little laborer from before. Having developed his spiritual sense, he feared no one below the Foundation Establishment stage. Even against Foundation Establishment cultivators, with some preparation, he could hold his own.

As for Golden Core cultivators, Gu Mo doubted the hidden evil cultivator could be at that level. It would be nearly impossible for a Golden Core evil cultivator to hide in a major sect like Qinglu. At most, they might be at the early or middle stages of Foundation Establishment—perhaps late-stage or peak Foundation Establishment at the very most.

With this in mind, Gu Mo felt slightly more at ease. This was the confidence that came with strength. Still, he reminded Yuan Niya not to let her guard down.

The three then began discussing their plans for the mission.

Meanwhile, at Gu Mo's spirit herb field...

A middle-aged cultivator dressed in laborer disciple robes quietly arrived outside the field. After scanning the protective formation surrounding it, the man smirked disdainfully and stepped right through.

The formation Gu Mo had set up was only a relatively ordinary first-grade formation, and it had been deployed using a formation plate—making it even less effective than one personally arranged by a formation master.

Truly good formations required masters to make fine adjustments based on terrain to maximize their power. The fixed templates of formation plates couldn't achieve this.

Still, formation plate deployments were sufficient against ordinary Qi Condensation cultivators. But against Foundation Establishment cultivators, their effectiveness was quite limited.

Clearly, this intruding middle-aged cultivator wasn't at the Qi Condensation stage. Only Foundation Establishment cultivators with developed spiritual sense could detect the subtle flaws in formation plate deployments and easily bypass them.

"Not bad at all," the middle-aged cultivator murmured as he passed through the formation and surveyed the spirit herb field. He had come to deliver new instructions to Gu Mo, using the same method as before—leaving them directly in Gu Mo's room.

He preferred this approach because it instilled fear. If he could silently infiltrate someone's room, he could just as silently make them disappear.

The middle-aged cultivator strode confidently toward the field's small hut, failing to notice an inconspicuous round-headed stick on the ground before him.

*Crack!*

Only when he stepped on the stick did he realize something was wrong. A surge of intense terror rose within him—the instinctive danger sense of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Reacting purely on instinct, he immediately leaped backward.

*BOOM!*

The ground erupted in that instant. Everything within a three-meter diameter was annihilated—including one of the cultivator's arms and a leg that failed to clear the blast radius in time.

"AAAHHH!"

The sudden loss of limbs sent waves of agony through the man, drawing an involuntary scream. Simultaneously, terror gripped his heart.

He couldn't comprehend what had just happened. That seemingly small explosion had completely obliterated his limbs. If not for his danger instinct making him retreat instinctively, it wouldn't have been just an arm and leg—his entire body would have been annihilated.

He was a Foundation Establishment cultivator! While not a body cultivator, his physical resilience at this level shouldn't have been weak. Yet against that explosion, he had no resistance whatsoever.

Without hesitation, the maimed cultivator stumbled toward the field's exit, abandoning his original mission entirely. With his life on the line, he had no mind for anything else. Worse, if Qinglu Sect captured him, their entire plan could be compromised.

*Hmm!*

But the moment he moved, his instincts warned him of another threat.

"What now?!"

His gaze darted around until he spotted a green spiritual pea suddenly shooting toward him from the herb field—emanating Foundation Establishment-level power.

Instinctively, he tried to dodge. But he'd forgotten his missing limbs severely limited his mobility. There was no avoiding this pea's trajectory.

*THUD!*

The green pea struck him squarely, sending him flying.

At that moment, a fish head emerged from the field's irrigation water and spat a water arrow at the airborne cultivator. The arrow itself was weak, incapable of piercing a Foundation Establishment cultivator's defenses—but it altered his trajectory.

Unfortunately for him, his new landing spot contained another potato mine. And this one was also second-grade—part of the stockpile Gu Mo had accumulated over six months, originally intended for use during Yuan Niya's True Disciple Trial.

"I'm done for..."

As his body descended, the cultivator heard that dreaded *click* again. Despair flooded his mind. He couldn't understand how a simple mission to deliver instructions had come to this.

He'd scanned the area with his spiritual sense and detected nothing unusual. So why were there such terrifying weapons here? WHY?!

*BOOOOM!*

With another deafening explosion, the cultivator's body was completely annihilated—leaving no trace behind. A Foundation Establishment cultivator had trespassed into Gu Mo's spirit herb field, only to meet absolute obliteration. This outcome perfectly demonstrated the lethality of Gu Mo's home defenses.

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*

Not long after the cultivator's death, three sword beams arrived in quick succession—Gu Mo and his two companions, who had rushed over immediately after Little Carp alerted Gu Mo through their contract about the intruder.

Entering the field, Gu Mo was greeted by two massive craters. The intruder had completely vanished. Approaching the irrigation channel, Little Carp swam over to recount events. While the fish's limited intelligence prevented a detailed account, Gu Mo pieced together the gist.

He speculated this intruder was likely the same evil cultivator who had previously infiltrated his room. Probably emboldened by past successes, the cultivator had grown complacent—never imagining a mere Qi Condensation junior could possess weapons capable of instantly killing Foundation Establishment experts.

Moreover, buried potato mines could evade spiritual sense detection. Carelessness easily led to falling into such traps.

Yet even so, the intruder had triggered two second-grade potato mines and taken a hit from a second-grade pea shooter before being eliminated. This alone proved the intruder's exceptional capabilities.

"Good job!"

Learning that Little Carp's final push had secured the kill, Gu Mo didn't skimp on praise. However, with Yuan Niya and Chu Feifei present, he couldn't reward the fish with Sun Essence—that would have to wait until later.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, did someone break in?" Yuan Niya asked, eyeing the two craters.

"Yes, but there's no damage. They probably got scared off," Gu Mo replied, withholding the full truth. This matter involved evil cultivators, and he didn't know if there were accomplices. Keeping it low-key was best—with the intruder completely obliterated, Gu Mo could feign ignorance.

Yuan Niya didn't suspect anything. The three-meter craters were misleading—she assumed they were from basic explosive traps at the Qi Condensation first or second layer, only capable of scaring people off.

She'd never imagine these craters had just annihilated a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"Gu Mo, let me strengthen your formation," Chu Feifei offered. Now a formation master herself, she could rework Gu Mo's defenses.

"Please do," Gu Mo agreed. His field's formation indeed needed upgrading. While potato mines and pea shooters provided last-resort protection, keeping intruders out entirely with formations was the ideal solution.

Meanwhile, at the main peak...

He Shaogang sat with closed eyes, contemplating how to leverage his status to maximize damage to Qinglu Sect during this True Disciple Trial.

His primary consideration was how to utilize Gu Mo—this chess piece—to eliminate Yuan Niya, the most promising True Disciple candidate.

"He should have received the orders by now," He Shaogang murmured as his eyes slowly opened.
