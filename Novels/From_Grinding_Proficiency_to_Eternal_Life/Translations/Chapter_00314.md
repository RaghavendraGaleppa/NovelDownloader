# Chapter 314: There's Always Some Scum

Xu Yunfan accepted the silk pouch without refusal and tucked it into his robe.

The disciples present were overjoyed, especially the round-faced one whose ears turned red with excitement. To serve by the side of a figure who might one day lead the Dao Sect was an opportunity many would kill for.

The group escorted Xu Yunfan out of the courtyard gate and into the bustling night of Yujing City.

On the Vermilion Bird Street, lanterns hung high like a sea of fire, illuminating the bluestone pavement with a flowing, colorful glow. Shops lined the streets in close succession. The cloud brocade in the silk shops shimmered softly under the lights, while the exotic incense from spice shops mixed with the rich aroma of wine wafting from taverns, tempting passersby to stop. In the distance, the sounds of silk and bamboo instruments drifted from pleasure quarters, occasionally punctuated by the crisp rattle of dice from gambling halls. The entire city seemed steeped in a smoke and fire of extravagance and dissipation.

As Xu Yunfan walked, he drew the attention of many observant eyes. He wore the Dark Gold Dragon Scale Armor, and though concealed by his robes, occasional glimpses of the scales revealed a chilling gleam. A pair of Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammers hung at his waist, and the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane on his back was a startling crimson. Even more intimidating was the Sky Piercing Cloud Breaker Bow slung across his back; though the string was not drawn, it hummed on its own, faintly carrying the sound of wind and thunder.

Such a display of divine weapons and strange phenomena caused the martial artists along the route to stop and stare, even the old veterans napping in the teahouses by the street suddenly opened their eyes.

"What an imposing display!" a bearded, burly man carrying a pair of swords couldn't help but smack his lips, his eyes filled with greed.

Before he finished speaking, the scholar in green beside him suddenly snapped his folding fan shut, staring fixedly at the jade token at Xu Yunfan's waist. "The Profound Heaven Token? Could it be the new disciple from the Dao Sect..."

He cut himself off, having recognized him as the fierce character who had recently conquered the擂台 of thirty-six peaks and gone toe-to-toe with visceral refinement realm experts.

Instantly, the thoughts rising in his heart were forcibly suppressed.

Halfway through their tour, the round-faced disciple moved closer to Xu Yunfan and pointed at a three-story pavilion with upturned eaves ahead. "Senior Brother Xu, the night snacks at the Long Wind Tavern ahead are a specialty of Yujing! Their 'Snow Bud Stewed Deer Tendons' are slow-cooked for three hours in soup made from Qingzhou Snow Bud tea, and the deer tendons melt in your mouth. The 'Eight Treasure Gourd Duck' is a secret technique; it has the Eight Treasures hidden inside its belly. Even the officials from the Imperial City Division often come here for a meal."

Xu Yunfan looked up and nodded slightly. "Let's go have a taste."

The original owner had grown up in Yujing City, but most of his time was spent within the Jiang residence, rarely coming out. How could he have visited such places? Now that he finally had some free time, Xu Yunfan, who loved good food, naturally wanted to check out the taste of this chain restaurant in Yujing.

The Long Wind Tavern was brightly lit, with glazed lanterns hanging under the flying eaves, swaying gently in the night breeze and reflecting the pavilion's golden splendor. As soon as he entered, the first-floor hall was a hubbub of voices. Waiters carrying gilded trays weaved through the crowd, the delicacies on the plates exuding a mouth-watering fragrance. A few tables of wandering heroes were drinking and toasting, their swords and sabers laid across the tables, occasionally letting out the secret codes of various sects amidst their laughter. In a corner, a group of merchants in fine clothes whispered secrets, the faint sound of abacus beads clashing coming from their sleeves.

Guided by the Dao Sect disciples, Xu Yunfan stepped onto the sandalwood staircase leading to the second floor. The moment he ascended, he felt the qi around him shift—the staircase actually conformed to the "Nine Turns of Clear Sound" recorded in the *Exploitation of the Works of Nature*, with each step embedded with a special sound-absorbing device from the Heavenly Work Cave, dissolving the noise from below into nothingness. Thanks to the building's ingenious construction, the clamor from the first floor instantly became barely audible. Xu Yunfan could tell that these structures were clearly the work of the Heavenly Work Department of the Heavenly Work Cave. He didn't expect their business to have reached Yujing City. Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh; he would naturally have to visit the Heavenly Work Cave's base tomorrow to take a look.

The private rooms on the second floor were separated by screens made of century-old lightning-struck sandalwood, with cloud patterns carved in relief on each screen that concealed formations, providing both sound insulation and protection against prying eyes. The sound of silk and bamboo drifted from the eastern wing, faintly discernible as the melody of "Song of the Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Jacket."

The group did not linger on the second floor but, led by the Dao Sect disciples, ascended to the third floor. There were only four private rooms on the third floor, with curtains woven from shark skin silk, immune to fire and water, showing the great care taken. The round-faced disciple lifted the curtain of the "Heaven C" private room. Only after Xu Yunfan took his seat did he say with some pride, "Rest assured, Senior Brother Xu. The third floor of this Drunken Immortal Tower has always only received high-level figures from various sects. Last month, when the Peak Master of the Profound Cloud Peak hosted a banquet here, even the waiters were bone-refining realm experts." He pointed to the black iron token hanging at the corner of the curtain. "With this, as disciples of the Dao Sect, there is truly nowhere in Yujing City we cannot go, except for a few restricted areas guarded by the Imperial City Division."

Before the round-faced disciple finished speaking, the隔壁 "Heaven B" private room suddenly let out a sinister sneer. "Oh, the Dao Sect can go anywhere? I wonder if it can splash around in a dry latrine?" Immediately after, a chorus of delicate, giggling laughter rang out.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and lightly tapped the table with his fingertips, silently sensing the qi in the隔壁 room. *Not weak, but not particularly strong either.* The one who could say such things was likely a disciple from one of the Six Major Sects. To speak with such disrespect, it was highly possible they were from the Sword Pavilion, which was on extremely bad terms with the Dao Sect. *Sword Pavilion disciples from the Jiangnan Dao...*

The round-faced disciple's face flushed red, and he was about to retort, but Xu Yunfan raised a hand to press down on his shoulder. "Order the food first."

These three words contained the oscillating force of the *Pure Yang Qi Technique*. The sound wave pierced through the shark silk curtain, making the tea cups in the隔壁 room rattle. The隔壁 room immediately fell silent, clearly realizing a master was sitting in the Dao Sect's room. A moment later, a cold snort was heard, followed by deliberately lowered conversation. The other party had recognized Xu Yunfan's thick qi of the marrow cleansing great completion realm.

The deer tendons were served in a green jade bowl; the tea soup was clear to the bottom, and the tendons were as translucent as amber. The eight-treasure duck was in a purple clay pot; the moment the lotus leaf lid was lifted, the dried scallops, pine mushrooms, and other treasures hidden inside exuded a rich aroma. The Cold Pond Fragrance wine was a pale green color, with tiny ice crystals swimming in the cup.

"They say Yujing City gathers all the world's treasures. Seeing it today, the reputation is well-deserved," someone remarked halfway through the meal.

Suddenly, a sneer came from the隔壁 room again. "Oh, so you're eating so heartily even with the stuff brought from the dry latrine?"

The green jade chopsticks in Xu Yunfan's hand paused slightly. He let out a soft sigh and put down his chopsticks, his voice neither light nor heavy, just enough for the隔壁 room to hear. "The only bad thing about the Long Wind Tavern is that it's a mix of dragons and snakes; there's always some scum that slips in."

The隔壁 room slammed a table, and an angry voice erupted. "What did you say?"

Xu Yunfan remained silent as iron, saying no more. Suddenly, he grabbed the Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammers and, under the horrified gazes of the Dao Sect disciples, smashed through the wall with a thunderous crash.

As bricks and stones flew, a scholar in green stood there with his hand on his sword, his knuckles tapping the scabbard with a clear sound. Amidst the dust filling the air, their gazes met like clashing lightning, actually causing the bronze bells at the eaves to clang violently.

Without the slightest hesitation, Xu Yunfan's right arm muscles coiled like a dragon. The powerful force within his body surged with the boiling of his blood and qi. The jade marrow and golden bones emitted a brilliant golden light. Three layers of force exploded from the Yongquan acupoint at the soles of his feet, converging into the hammer handle through the twisting of his waist and hips.
