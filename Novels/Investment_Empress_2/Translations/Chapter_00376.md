# Chapter 376: New Year Preparations and the Demonic Summoning Sect’s Message

“Wow, you’ve even learned to lie.”

“You’re this bold at home; imagine how you’d be outside! Tell us everything—how did you bully her!”

Young Master Li was about to be crushed by the landslide of his parents' love when Ying Bing lightly pressed her lips together.

“Uncle, Auntie, he tricked me into calling him ‘Big Brother’ last night.”

“Then... what about the ‘Dual Cultivation’?” Big Dragon didn’t loosen his grip on the rolling pin.

Li Mo sighed helplessly. “Dad, I told you, that’s a legitimate cultivation method. It’s just like the *Sun and Moon Convergence*. Even though those are two different sword arts, they count as dual-cultivation martial arts too.”

Well, the *Phoenix Singing in the Sky Marsh* was indeed very proper.

If you ignored the third layer, that is.

The couple looked at Ying Bing.

Ying Bing lowered her gaze and glanced at Li Mo. Seeing the ‘I admit defeat’ look in his eyes, she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and gave a slight nod.

The truth was revealed. At least, that was what Old Li and Mrs. Gu thought.

“So that’s how it was.”

“Right, Bing’er has never lied to us. That must be true. That makes more sense.”

“Dad, Mom, that’s exactly what I said earlier, but you wouldn’t listen to me.”

“You told me this morning that you just walked into the wrong room in the middle of the night. Did you think you could fool my sharp eyes with such nonsense? My eyes are as precise as a ruler!”

“Bing’er, have some porridge. If Little Mo bullies you in the future, you must tell us right away. We’ll beat his butt until it blooms.”

“??? How could I possibly bully her!”

Li Mo was utterly bewildered. It seemed he had become the outsider here. Where was the basic trust between parents and child? Besides, he was old enough now; why were they still talking about spanking?

“Thank you, Uncle, Auntie.”

Ying Bing accepted their words seriously. Her beautiful eyes swept over Li Mo, flickering with a hint of amusement. It seemed she was remembering the times during their sword practice when her ruler would often aim for his... exposed backside.

While eating breakfast, Gu Xueqin spoke again.

“It’s normal for young people to have urges. Big Dragon and I were the same when we were young, but you must know your limits.”

“We are very mindful. We have always been very proper,” Li Mo said with the air of a perfect gentleman.

Isn’t doing a foot massage perfectly normal? Doesn’t that count as stopping where propriety dictates? It is very proper.

No sooner had the words left his mouth than he sucked in a cold breath. He looked down to see a small boot stepping on the back of his foot, grinding lightly.

The owner of the foot was, of course, the cold fairy who was drinking her porridge with an icy expression.

“Little Mo, I’m talking to you. Why are you grimacing and twitching?”

“Tsk, this porridge is too sweet. It’s making my teeth ache.”

“?”

Li Dalong opened his mouth, wanting to say something more, but footsteps came from outside. A pair of official boots crossed the threshold.

The visitor was an old subordinate of the father. He immediately called out, “Chief Li,” then lowered his voice to report to Old Li.

“Chief Li, trouble. There’s a Nian Beast at the old Ying estate! It looks just like the one from ten years ago...”

“That beast has actually returned?!”

Li Dalong shot to his feet, his face grim.

“Wife, get my armor and weapons!”

Old Li looked heroic. “The blood debt from ten years ago, it is time to settle it today. Killing that beast will be an offering to the spirits of Brother Ying and his wife...”

“Husband! Can you defeat it?”

“A man can’t say he can’t. I’ll fight with my life first.”

“.....”

Young Master Li and the Ice Cube exchanged a glance and默契地 (tacitly) buried their heads in their breakfast.

The subordinate, however, had a question mark floating above his head. *You have two prodigies who have slain countless beasts in the South and are famous throughout the world standing right here, and you’re talking about fighting with your life? What is this all about?*

“Ahem, Chief Li, I know you want to fight, but please hold off.”

“The Nian Beast is already dead. We don’t know who killed it. I came to report so you can go inspect the scene.”

“Ah?”

The atmosphere, which had been building up, was instantly doused with cold water. It was... suddenly bald.

Dad went to the old estate. After the meal, Gu Xueqin led the maids in cleaning up the house to prepare for the upcoming New Year. After all, with the two youngsters at home, the family’s status was no longer what it used to be. The Li household’s New Year was bound to be lively.

“It’s New Year’s time. We need to make a few more sets of proper clothes. The children are growing so fast.”

“Bring the lanterns here. We need to hang them high.”

Gu Xueqin had just finished instructing the maids when she turned and saw Ying Bing there as well.

“Auntie, I’ll hang one too.”

Ying Bing’s voice was soft, gentler than usual.

Gu Xueqin was taken aback.

In previous years, this child would become even more silent than usual when the New Year came around, as if the festival had nothing to do with her. The couple knew the reason. Now, she was actively participating in the New Year preparations. The sun wasn’t rising from the west today, was it?

“Good, good, good. Bing’er, let’s hang it together. With the lanterns hung, we’ll have a prosperous year ahead.”

This year, the two little ones seemed to have changed compared to the past.

Li Mo watched for a moment and was about to go help, but suddenly, he sensed a commotion from something inside his System space.

“Mom, I’ll be right back.”

He excused himself and went to a secluded spot, taking out a Beast Token.

It was a token from the Demonic Summoning Sect. Last time, after Hall Master Luo Yexian of the Hundred Beasts Hall was... persuaded, ahem, *invited* to visit the Vast Expanse Immortal Sect, he offered it with both hands. He said that since the Sacred Sect and the Immortal Sect were to exchange information freely, if there was anything to discuss, they could use this token.

After checking that there were no harmful mechanisms on it, Li Mo accepted it.

“What business does the Demonic Summoning Sect have now? Do these demonic cultivators not celebrate the New Year...”

Li Mo flipped out the token and saw a faint light emitting from it, along with a slight warmth. A fluctuation that only a Divine Spectator Warrior could receive came from within.

*Three days from now, the圣子 (Holy Son) and two Dharma Kings will arrive in the East Wasteland Domain. They both hold the Highest Immortal in great esteem and hope to meet you at Ziyang Prefecture City to discuss grand affairs—Luo Yexian.*

The Demonic Summoning Holy Son and the Demonic Summoning Dharma Kings?

Li Mo held the token, frowned, and fell into deep thought.

The Demonic Summoning Holy Son was once ranked first on the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List), but unfortunately, he encountered the Crown Prince of the Great Yu Dynasty. Rumors circulated at the time that he had been slain. Or perhaps he truly died once and was resurrected by some sinister method. In any case, he only re-emerged in the江湖 (Jianghu) several years later.

This person was obviously not as easily fooled as Luo Yexian. Furthermore, he was bringing two Dharma Kings. Just from the title, one could tell they were high-level figures of the Demonic Summoning Sect.

“Are the Dharma Kings of the Demonic Summoning Sect all Body Transformation experts?”

“They must be harboring intentions to test me...”

“Should I go or not?”

Li Mo thought it over and finally made his decision.

He would go!

If he didn’t go, the other party wouldn’t easily give up. Who knows when they might show up at his doorstep again. Moreover, the ‘Power of All Living Beings’ would be nothing but a joke.

It’s better to fear thieves who watch than thieves who steal. Although, it seems I am the thief here...

Anyway, since a date was set, he could at least make preparations. Going would mean going with a plan.
