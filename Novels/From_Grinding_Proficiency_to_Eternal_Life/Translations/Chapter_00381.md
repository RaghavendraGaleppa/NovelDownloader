# Chapter 381: Only to Kill

The foreign energies rampaged through his meridians, forcing him to mobilize several times his own True Qi to suppress them forcibly.

The Ten Extremes True Qi transformed into a millstone-like vortex, grinding and consuming those stubborn True Elements bit by bit. However, for every fraction he refined, he lost three parts of his own True Qi.

This was not a devouring; it was a loss-making transaction!

"He's absorbing our True Elements?!"

The round-faced disciple finally saw the key point, his voice changing pitch.

"Hahaha, this guy is truly seeking death!"

A tall disciple opened his mouth and laughed. The True Scriptures and techniques cultivated by various schools were different, and the True Elements they refined also had their own characteristics. To absorb someone else's True Elements, not exploding and dying would be considered a light consequence.

Xu Yunfan paid no attention to these people's ridicule. The golden lake at the intersection of his flesh and blood was boiling. Although the devoured True Elements were few and were dissipated by dozens of times his True Qi, they acted like a catalyst, accelerating the process of his True Qi liquefying.

He slowly raised his head, his crimson golden pupils sweeping over the Yuan Shi Sect disciples present.

The Ten Extremes True Qi around him was as deep as an abyss and as vast as the sea, seemingly unaffected at all.

"Impossible..."

A disciple's voice trembled.

They had witnessed with their own eyes this person devouring the True Elements of various schools, yet now there wasn't even the slightest sign of True Qi disorder. The foreign energies that should have clashed and caused him to explode were now converging at his Dantian like hundreds of rivers returning to the sea, turning into a shimmering golden lake.

"This person must have obtained the inheritance of the Divine Martial True Lord."

A disciple's voice was low. Immediately after, someone's eyes flickered, as if thinking of something.

He subconsciously exchanged a glance with the nominal disciple, and both saw the strangeness in each other's eyes.

"Scatter!"

The scarred man suddenly threw out a dark green bead.

The moment the bead exploded, a foul, sweet-smelling thick fog filled an area of a hundred zhang.

Bone Rotting Miasma, this was an evil object refined by the Disciples of the Hundred Desires Peak using the resentment of mortals.

Using the cover of the toxic fog, the remaining five people fled in different directions. The scarred man turned into a green rainbow shooting towards the East, the round-faced disciple offered a silver talisman and stuck it on his back, his speed increasing threefold, while the remaining three dispersed in a 120-degree angle to escape.

Xu Yunfan's eyes suddenly burst with crimson golden light, a vertical line between his eyebrows opened like a heavenly eye. The Ten Extremes True Qi circulated in his pupils, transforming into a Martial Dao Heavenly Eye that could pierce through illusions.

The Bone Rotting Miasma was like nothing in his line of sight. The five fleeing figures were all locked down. The light of the escape talisman on the scarred man's waist, the burning trajectory of the silver talisman on the round-faced disciple's back, and even the fluctuations of True Element flow in the meridians of the three fleeing in different directions were all clearly reflected in these divine eyes like the lines on his palm.

This Martial Dao Heavenly Eye formed by breaking through the Nine Realm's shackles seemed exceptionally powerful.

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred with some thoughts.

He immediately retracted his mind and shot towards the Northwest continuously. The Void Piercing Cloud Piercing Bow trembled each time, taking a life. When the fourth arrow shot through the round-faced disciple's chest mirror, the latter suddenly crushed the jade talisman in his heart, his body briefly turning intangible to avoid the fatal blow.

"Interesting."

Xu Yunfan showed a serious expression for the first time.

The round-faced disciple saw Xu Yunfan's gaze sweep over and immediately felt as if he had fallen into an ice pit, his heart cursing incessantly.

He had just used his only Minor Shift Talisman, but he never expected this fierce star's archery to be even more brutal than his previous mace technique!

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his fellow disciples turning into escape lights and scattering, disappearing from the horizon in the blink of an eye, their presence completely hidden. The round-faced disciple cursed inwardly: "这群畜生，逃得比鬣狗分尸还快！" (These beasts, fleeing faster than hyenas tearing a corpse apart!)

Seeing Xu Yunfan raise his bow again, he suddenly slid to his knees, his knees plowing two deep grooves in the scorched earth: "Senior, spare my life! I am willing to offer the secrets of the Yuan Shi Sect!"

The humming of the bowstring stopped abruptly.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. The crimson golden arrow light condensed on the Void Piercing Cloud Piercing Bow gradually dissipated, but the Ten Extremes True Qi still locked down the area within ten zhang like a cage.

"Three breaths."

Xu Yunfan's fingers tapped lightly on the mace body, "Tell me something I don't know."

The round-faced disciple pressed his forehead to the ground, his words rapid: "I am Chen Jiuchuan of the White Cliff Peak, a disciple of the Hundred Cliff True Lord! I am not of the same kind as those filthy Disciples of the Hundred Desires Peak! We... are good people!"

He suddenly tore open his robe, revealing a mountain tattoo on his chest, "Look at this technique imprint of the Hundred Cliff Scripture! Our peak specializes in suppression techniques and never touches blood sacrifices or dual cultivation! We only take from the earth veins!"

Only taking from the earth veins...

A hint of mockery appeared on Xu Yunfan's face. Once the earth veins are taken, the vitality of the four sides of the mountain would be completely destroyed. In terms of sin, it would probably be even greater than harvesting blood sacrifices.

Xu Yunfan's Martial Dao Heavenly Eye swept over the tattoo and indeed sensed a True Element trace as heavy as a mountain, completely different from the strange demonic energy of the previous Youquan.

Seeing a chance, Chen Jiuchuan hurriedly added: "The Hundred Cliff True Lord is in closed-door training for a long time, and the White Cliff Peak is heavily suppressed within the sect. This time I entered the Divine Martial Realm, it was purely for the sake of..."

A Sea Suppressing Mountain Shaking Hammer rested on his shoulder. Chen Jiuchuan felt his shoulder sink, as if a mountain was pressing down on him. He looked up and saw Xu Yunfan looking at him with a似笑非笑 (似笑非笑 - a smile that isn't a smile, a knowing smile).

"So you want to use the sect's internal strife to exchange for a way to live?"

"No! Senior, I know the rules of the boundary gate of the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm! Senior must want to get out, right? The Divine Martial Realm is controlled by the Yuan Shi Sect, and this time it was led by the Hundred Desires Peak. If you want to get out, I have a way!"

Chen Jiuchuan said righteously: "With Senior's strength, it is truly a waste to be in the Divine Martial Realm!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly bent down and picked up Chen Jiuchuan: "Do you have Meridian Opening Pills?"

"This..."

Chen Jiuchuan's heart suddenly understood. No wonder this guy in front of him has True Qi as vast as the sea but hasn't further refined True Elements. It turns out he has no meridians in his body.

He showed a difficult expression, "This time coming to the Divine Martial Realm is just to harvest human resources and blood sacrifices. A Meridian Opening Pill requires at least a thousand contribution points to exchange from the sect, and I don't have one either."

Speaking of this, Chen Jiuchuan also felt his nose sting slightly. It was too difficult.

Since joining the Yuan Shi Sect, he has been running around for money every day, to avoid becoming someone else's human resource. Now he is living a miserable life, how could he exchange for a pill that is useless to him.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's eyelids droop, Chen Jiuchuan's back tightened.

"Senior, please wait!"

Chen Jiuchuan suddenly straightened his back, "I know the rules of the boundary gate of the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm!"

He pointed to the faint purple mark in the sky, "Every sixty years on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when the barrier between the two realms is at its thinnest! Approximately three months later, the people of Flower Town will open the gap between the realms again. That is the time for us to return. I have a way to let Senior pass through."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's eyes move, he hurriedly added: "Although the White Cliff Peak doesn't have Meridian Opening Pills, the Hundred Cliff True Lord has the Hundred Bones Connecting Secret Art!"

As he spoke, he tore open his collar and took out a jade book from his Sumeru Bag, "This technique can reshape the meridians, and its effect is ten times better than a Meridian Opening Pill!"

A cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes: "Hundred Bones Connecting Secret Art?"

He sneered, his fingertips suddenly bursting with crimson golden True Qi, "You dare to fool me? I have long known the cultivation method of the Hundred Bones Connecting Secret Art."
