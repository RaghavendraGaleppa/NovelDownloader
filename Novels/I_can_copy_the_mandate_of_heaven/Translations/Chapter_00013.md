## Chapter 13: Pharmacology

"What's this?" Sitting across from Mo Dakou, Li Zhiming forced himself to take a closer look at the withered, dark fruit pointed out by Mo Dakou. The fruit had a dark purple hue and a wrinkled skin resembling dried-up grapes, but it was much larger.

"This is the fruit of the Chinese Boxthorn," Li Zhiming said, his voice a bit louder. "It nourishes the kidneys and liver, improves vision, and promotes black hair."

Li Zhiming wanted to glance at Mo Dakou, suggesting that he could eat it, but he swallowed his words.

Han Ke, sitting beside him, cast a brief, incredulous glance at Li Zhiming before quickly looking down.

Mo Dakou stroked his chin, examining the dark-skinned child. "What does your family do?" he asked.

Li Zhiming stuttered, "W-we farm."

Mo Dakou nodded and pointed to another substance. Li Zhiming followed his gesture and recognized it as Fructus Cannabis, used for smoothing intestines and facilitating bowel movements. He hesitated before shaking his head.

Mo Dakou seemed to relax, nodding slightly. "Not bad."

He turned to Han Ke, and the boy's back straightened as sweat began to trickle down his spine.

Mo Dakou didn't seem interested in intimidating them, however. Instead, he stroked his beard and said, "I'll describe a medicinal property, and you choose the corresponding herb."

"Be careful not to make a mistake."

"Yes," Han Ke replied, his voice trembling. He had no idea what any of these herbs were, except for one.

Mo Dakou began, "It stops bleeding, disperses blood stasis, reduces swelling, and relieves pain."

Han Ke's mind went blank. He felt Mo Dakou's intense gaze on him, and his breathing quickened. Sweat poured out of his pores as he frantically searched for an answer.

Just as he was about to give up, he felt a gentle nudge on his foot. He glanced at Li Zhiming, who was making subtle hand gestures.

Han Ke followed his companion's gaze and randomly picked a herb that resembled dried ginger.

"Is this it, sir?" he asked.

Mo Dakou examined the herb and asked, "What's its name?"

Han Ke panicked, but then noticed Li Zhiming's hand signals under the table. He mimicked the gestures and replied, "Is it Sanqi?"

Mo Dakou didn't react, simply nodding and asking another question, "Which herb has the effects of calming the fetus and stopping sweating?"

Han Ke was stumped, but Li Zhiming's gestures helped him pick a purple flower with tendrils.

"Not bad," Mo Dakou said.

The next question was, "What treats weakness, blood, and intestinal disorders?"

This time, Li Zhiming directly pointed to an herb, and Han Ke quickly picked it up. 

Mo Dakou smiled wryly, seemingly unimpressed.

When Han Ke picked the same herb Li Zhiming had previously identified as unknown - Huomaren - Li Zhiming's eyes widened in fear. He felt as though he'd been caught red-handed.

Mo Dakou remained silent, stroking his beard as he gazed at the two children. "It's alright; you both have some basic knowledge. I'll take you in."

He turned to Han Ke. "You, follow me and start learning from the basics of herbal medicine."

He then turned to Li Zhiming. "You, cultivate medicinal herbs for a month. Now, show me your hand."

Li Zhiming hesitantly extended his right hand, and Mo Dakou pulled out a ruler.

Thirty swift strikes left Li Zhiming's hand throbbing and swelling. Tears streamed down his face as he endured the pain.

As Mo Dakou walked away with Han Ke, Li Zhiming sat alone outside, nursing his wounded hand. He began to think about his family and friends back home.

As night fell, Li Zhiming's stomach growled. Just then, Han Ke appeared with a steaming bun and a bottle of herbs.
