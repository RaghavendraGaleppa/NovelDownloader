# Chapter 104: I Shall Share This Empire With You!

The remnant jade entered his body!

Yuan Zhengfeng's Human Immortal-level mana was completely mobilized by the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique!  
Li Zhengjing's body was flooded with surging mana that burst through his meridians and flesh, only to be instantly restored by the Celestial Azure Dao Treasure.

With his mana erupting, he wielded the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber and used the Five Thunder Mountain-Splitting Saber Technique to repel the golden dragon beside him.  
He soared into the air, charging straight toward the Crown Prince!

"Impossible!"  
The Crown Prince's expression was filled with shock. "How could you become a Human Immortal in less than a year?"

"Human Immortal? Li Zhengjing is a Human Immortal?"  
The newly appointed Ancient Moon Peak Master, Chen Zhu, felt his pupils constrict and his heart tremble violently.  

He had cultivated for nearly a hundred years, exhausting all his efforts, and only now, with the help of the Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed, had he been fortunate enough to become a Human Immortal and ascend to the position of Ancient Moon Peak's Chief.  

Yet this junior, who had entered the sect less than a year ago and had been nothing more than an oppressed outer disciple just three or four months ago—someone even a useless figure like Chen Youyu could easily manipulate—now stood before him.  

At this moment, Chen Zhu, a Human Immortal of this era, felt his mouth go dry, because he suddenly realized that the aura Li Zhengjing was displaying might actually surpass his own!  

Because in this instant, Li Zhengjing had shattered nearly two hundred acupoints, and his mana surged through them, condensing into the Great Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi outside his body.  

The sharpness of the sword intent crossed great distances, bypassing the formation, and even the Human Immortals within the formation felt a chill in their hearts.  

As for ordinary cultivators, they trembled in fear, exerting all their strength to resist the overwhelming sharpness!  

Previously, they had all agreed that this young man, who had cultivated for such a short time, was already the strongest below the Human Immortal realm. But who could have imagined that he was actually a Human Immortal?  

Even more terrifying was that he had cultivated such a sharp sword intent. Calling him a Sword Immortal would not be an exaggeration!  

"The Great Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi?"  

The Human Immortal from the Kunlun Immortal Sect was utterly shocked. "Impossible! This sword technique has long been sealed away. Only the Young Sect Master of our sect has had access to it. How could an outsider have obtained the cultivation method?"  

At that moment, he heard the exclamation of the Arhat Hall Chief from the Vajra Temple beside him: "Another Sword Immortal has emerged in the world. We are saved!"  

The Kunlun Immortal Sect's Elder felt absurd.  

Sword Immortal? Could this young man truly be called a Sword Immortal, one whose foundation was the sword?  

He could clearly sense that the mana within Li Zhengjing's body had not truly condensed into the Great Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi. It was only when the mana was released outside his body that it took the form of sword qi!  

Moreover, this young man didn't even use a sword—he wielded a saber! How could he be called a Sword Immortal?  

"Li Zhengjing!"  

The Crown Prince's expression was grave, but his hands showed no mercy!  

He had anticipated everything—except that Li Zhengjing, the only one outside the formation, actually possessed the combat power of a Human Immortal!  

At this moment, the five divine beings were suppressing the five Human Immortals using the "Cauldron Formation." Even with the twenty-four Imperial Dragon Pillars, it was a struggle!  

These divine beings were originally Human Immortals who had died of old age. As founding heroes of the Great Zhou Dynasty, they had enjoyed wealth and honor before entering the bodies of Heavenly Domain Divine Stones, beginning their second lives!  

Even with centuries of imperial incense offerings slowing the decay of their souls, their combat power was still slightly weaker than in their previous lives!  

Right now, even the Crown Prince only dared to mobilize four Imperial Dragon Pillars to manifest golden dragons to deal with Li Zhengjing!  

But he could only control four golden dragons, not daring to use the remaining twenty pillars, as he needed them to maintain the "Cauldron Grand Formation."  

Moreover, he feared that without the support of the Imperial Dragon Pillars, the five divine beings would be unable to suppress the five Human Immortals. If they broke through the formation, all his efforts would be in vain!  

Even so, the four golden dragons summoned by the Imperial Jade Seal should have been enough to suppress an ordinary Human Immortal!  

Yet at this moment, a strange bird suddenly flew out from behind Li Zhengjing.  

The bird had green horns, golden feathers, a row of spikes along its back, sharp claws, and a long beak. With a single breath, it spewed forth a torrent of flames.  

Then, within the flames, another golden dragon emerged, bathed in fire!  

"Imperial Dragon Pillar?"  

Everyone present was shocked.  

The five Human Immortals and five divine beings were equally stunned.  

Chen Zhu, the newly ascended Human Immortal, even counted the Imperial Dragon Pillars forming the Cauldron Formation around them—there were exactly twenty-four!  

So how had this strange bird behind Li Zhengjing spat out a new golden dragon?  

Where had the twenty-fifth Imperial Dragon Pillar come from?  

"Golden dragons? Big deal!"  

The strange bird laughed wildly. "Master, don't worry! Leave the dragon we raised at home to me. Who can match it?"  

"This..."  

The Crown Prince felt his mouth go dry. Outsiders didn't know the truth about the Imperial Dragon Pillars, but he did.  

Originally, thirty-six Imperial Dragon Pillars had been forged. Eight hundred years ago, when the Creditor attacked, three were destroyed and nine were taken!  

The Great Zhou imperial family only had twenty-four left, and they had always claimed that only twenty-four had been forged!  

Now that this Imperial Dragon Pillar had appeared, did it mean the Creditor was coming?  

The Crown Prince's heart sank, but the killing intent in his eyes grew stronger!  

Behind Li Zhengjing, a tree suddenly leaped out, holding an ancient mirror with its five branches. Wherever the mirror shone, explosions erupted!  

A golden dragon formed from an Imperial Dragon Pillar was struck by the mirror, its scales shattering as light scattered like dragon blood.  

Two of the four golden dragons had been eliminated!  

"The Great Profound Dynasty's Mirror of Profound Reflection?"  

The Crown Prince's expression grew even uglier. With a thought, the remaining two golden dragons charged toward Li Zhengjing.  

But Li Zhengjing's nearly two hundred streams of mana, guided by the Feathering Ascension Dragon Celestial Immortal Art, transformed into two hundred small dragons, each spitting sword qi from their mouths!  

Great Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi!  

The two golden dragons couldn't get close!  

The Crown Prince's gaze grew even more solemn, his expression darkening.  

Seeing Li Zhengjing charging toward him and unable to mobilize the remaining twenty Imperial Dragon Pillars, he sighed and hurled the Imperial Jade Seal at Li Zhengjing!  

In that instant, a vast illusion appeared above the Imperial Jade Seal!  

It depicted the grandeur of mountains and rivers, the vastness of heaven and earth!  

This was the territory of the Great Zhou Dynasty, covering the Central Plains—a scene of prosperity!  

He intended to use the nation's fortune to suppress and kill Li Zhengjing!  

With the Imperial Jade Seal out of his hands, he could no longer borrow the innate fortunes of the countless cultivators across the land!  

In other words, he could no longer claim the title of emperor at this moment!  

But he still stood atop the palace!  

He could still become a Human Immortal today!  

"I can only retrieve and refine the Imperial Jade Seal after it kills Li Zhengjing..."  

The Crown Prince sighed inwardly. "But this means that today, I can only become a Human Immortal, not an Immortal Emperor of the mortal world!"  

Refining the Imperial Jade Seal again would take at least twelve hours!  

At such a critical moment, twelve hours could bring countless unforeseen changes!  

But this was already his only option—all because he had underestimated Li Zhengjing's abilities!  

"It's over!"  

Everyone within the Cauldron Formation was struck with horror, some even despairing.  

The Imperial Jade Seal symbolized the prosperity of the Great Zhou Dynasty. With the fortune of an entire nation pressing down, how could Li Zhengjing possibly withstand it?  

"He's dead, and so are you!"  

One of the five divine beings suppressing the formation, an eight-armed deity, declared with anger in his voice.  

The five Human Immortals inside, fighting against the divine beings, exchanged glances, their expressions complex.  

Forcing the Crown Prince to retreat and use the Imperial Jade Seal to kill Li Zhengjing meant that the next twelve hours would be the time for the great immortal sects and Buddhist sects to arrive and stop the Crown Prince from becoming emperor!  

This also meant that the Crown Prince had reached his final resort!  

But once Li Zhengjing died, the Crown Prince would calmly refine the five Human Immortals and thousands of cultivators within the Cauldron Formation, breaking the curse's shackles and becoming the first Human Immortal of the Great Zhou imperial family in centuries!  

Even if the three great immortal sects and two great Buddhist sects arrived later and killed the Crown Prince, preventing him from becoming an Immortal Emperor, by then—they would all already be reduced to ashes!  

"Second Brother..."  

Jia Shifang felt his mouth go dry, shocked and overjoyed by Li Zhengjing's display of Human Immortal power but now filled with sorrow at their predicament.  

The Imperial Jade Seal, bearing the fortune of an entire nation—this was surely the end.  

But after a moment's thought, he shouted, "Second Brother, don't rush on the road to the Yellow Springs. Wait for me—I'll join you soon!"  

"What kind of jinx are you?"  

The wall-clinging bird, controlling the golden dragon in battle, cursed before turning to look at Li Zhengjing, now enveloped by the illusion of mountains and rivers. It was stunned.  

"Master's done for?"  

"Stupid bird, what nonsense are you spouting? Good people die young, but troublemakers live a thousand years. Our master..."  

The Five Elements Creation Tree, holding the ancient mirror and chasing after the golden dragon, glanced toward Li Zhengjing and felt its heart tremble. Overcome with grief, it wailed, "Our master was actually a good person... This old tree has finally brought misfortune upon its master..."  

Within the illusion of mountains and rivers, Li Zhengjing appeared minuscule.  

Even the mighty power of a Human Immortal seemed insignificant before the vast fortune of a nation!  

Li Zhengjing felt an overwhelming pressure crushing him from all sides, threatening to pulverize him. He looked up as the Imperial Jade Seal descended toward his head!  

At this moment, the Imperial Jade Seal carried the weight of mountains and rivers—immeasurably heavy!  

If it landed, he would be crushed to paste. Even with the Celestial Azure Dao Treasure in his body, it might not save his life!  

"Ah Jing, we were too reckless..." Yuan Zhengfeng murmured.  

"This doesn't make sense." Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden book's fortune-telling page. "It clearly says I'll die from the backlash of the Great Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi in the future. That means I should be able to act recklessly in this cave heaven without consequences. So why am I about to die now?"  

BOOM!!!  

The Imperial Jade Seal descended straight toward his forehead!  

In the eyes of everyone present, Li Zhengjing was surely doomed!  

This genius, who had cultivated for such a short time yet transcended the ordinary to become a Human Immortal—with talent, bone structure, and comprehension that could be called unparalleled—was about to perish here!  

Pity and regret filled the gazes of all!  

Even Chen Zhu, who had once despised Li Zhengjing, couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow.  

"A true talent... What a shame."  

The Crown Prince averted his gaze, focusing on the process of his three souls and seven spirits condensing into a Yin Spirit, attempting to fuse it with his true qi to form the golden-liquid jade-like mana.  

But at that moment, the world fell silent!  

The flames still burned!  

The five Human Immortals stopped attacking the formation!  

The five divine beings halted their manipulation of the Imperial Dragon Pillars!  

The thousands of cultivators inside, their minds filled with complex emotions and their situations dire, also fell into dead silence!  

The Crown Prince's heart jolted. Slowly, he turned his head to look at Li Zhengjing, who should have been crushed by the fortune of the nation and slain by the Imperial Jade Seal.  

Instead, he saw a small, delicate, pale hand extending from behind Li Zhengjing.  

The tiny hand effortlessly caught the Imperial Jade Seal.  

Then, in the silence, a little girl crawled out of the wooden box on Li Zhengjing's back.  

Her features were exquisite, her eyes clear and bright, with two small horns on her head and a partially bald fish tail behind her.  

Holding the Imperial Jade Seal in one hand, she placed the other on Li Zhengjing's head, then wriggled her way onto his shoulder, staring wide-eyed at the Imperial Jade Seal.  

Thousands of eyes in the cave heaven were equally wide, fixed on the little girl staring at the Imperial Jade Seal.  

After a moment, the girl's lips quivered, her eyes filling with tears as she prepared to burst into sobs.  

"Tears are fine, but don't cry out loud," Li Zhengjing hurriedly said. "This is a serious moment—thousands are watching. What if you cry me unconscious?"  

"Jia si wang ya bie ga ga er a!"  

The little dragon girl trembled, biting her lip to hold back her sobs, but tears streamed down her face, forming pearls.  

"This Imperial Jade Seal was forged from your father's dragon horn?"  

Li Zhengjing was stunned, countless speculations flashing through his mind. But with the situation urgent, he had no time to dwell on them.  

He took out a jade vial and the young Wave-Severing Gu, using it to catch the teardrops.  

Then, gripping the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, he grinned savagely, letting out the triumphant laugh of a villain.  

"Crown Prince, you've thrown out the Imperial Jade Seal. What else do you have?"  

Li Zhengjing declared boldly, "Today, I'll shatter your dreams of becoming emperor and immortal, sending you to the Yellow Springs as a ghost!"  

He swung his saber, and thunder erupted!  

Five consecutive slashes unleashed five bolts of lightning, each stronger than the last!  

Li Zhengjing possessed the true combat power of a Human Immortal. No matter how strong his opponent was, they couldn't stand still and take five consecutive strikes!  

But at that moment, light erupted around the Crown Prince!  

Another divine artifact left by the Founding Emperor protected his life!  

Yet his crown still fell, his hair disheveled, his body scorched, his expression grim.  

Because he had taken half a step back!  

That half-step took him out of the formation's core!  

But now, he looked at Li Zhengjing and extended his hand, saying solemnly, "I've stepped half out of the formation, leaving half of the core empty..."  

His voice was calm as he continued, "You have the power to share with me the lifelong cultivation of these five Human Immortals and thousands of cultivators! Today... I can cede half of this empire to you. Let us share it and ascend to immortality together! With this grand formation and the great medicine of the five Human Immortals and thousands of cultivators, you can advance further, becoming a top-tier Human Immortal of this world!"
