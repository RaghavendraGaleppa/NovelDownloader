# Chapter 41: Bountiful Harvest

**Wood Spirit Peak**  

As one of the main peaks of the Qingheng Sect, the Wood Spirit Peak governed a vast territory.  

Mu Sen held a map covered in markings.  

"Junior Brother, take a look and choose which spiritual field you'd like." The map was densely packed with symbols, each representing a plot of spiritual land.  

White marks indicated low-grade spiritual fields, blue represented mid-grade, and green signified high-grade.  

"I'll take this one."  

Zhang Yan selected a field relatively close to Wood Spirit Peak.  

"Let me check if this plot meets the two thousand mu requirement." Mu Sen scrutinized the map and did some quick calculations. "It's a bit more—about twenty-two hundred mu. I'll speak with Master. Consider the extra two hundred mu a bonus."  

With that, Mu Sen led Zhang Yan straight to the location of the spiritual fields.  

The two thousand mu of mid-grade spiritual fields were situated on a vast plain beside a river. As far as the eye could see, lush greenery stretched endlessly—the fields were already brimming with spiritual rice.  

"These spiritual rice crops originally belonged to Master, but since he's giving them to you now, they're yours."  

"That doesn't seem right!"  

Hearing this, Zhang Yan felt a pang of guilt.  

Over two thousand mu of spiritual rice—grown in mid-grade spiritual fields, no less—how much spirit stone value did that amount to? Taking it all for free felt somewhat improper.  

"What's the big deal? Do you really think Master cares about such trifles? Let me tell you, when it comes to Master's generosity, never hold back out of politeness. Back in the day, I suffered because I was too reserved." As he spoke, a rare trace of sorrow flickered across Mu Sen's typically stoic expression.  

Zhang Yan fell silent.  

The more he interacted with Mu Sen, the more he realized that this seemingly dull senior brother was actually quite the character. Anyone who mistook him for a simpleton would be in for a rude awakening.  

"Understood. Thank you for the advice, Senior Brother." Zhang Yan nodded and followed Mu Sen to take possession of the mid-grade spiritual fields before moving on to the high-grade ones.  

Once everything was settled, he still felt as if he were dreaming.  

Without even realizing it, he had become a major landowner!  

With so many spiritual fields, tending to them alone would be impossible.  

Thus, he planned to hire some spiritual farmers to assist with cultivation.  

Compared to the cost of hiring spiritual plant cultivators, spiritual farmers were far more affordable. After all, being allowed to work under a spiritual plant cultivator was an opportunity—who would dare make demands?  

If you weren't willing, plenty of others would be!  

Of course, that was just a joke. They were all fellow sect members, and Zhang Yan would never exploit them harshly. He intended to offer terms similar to the sect's standard arrangements.  

---  

Once all formalities were completed, Mu Sen brought Zhang Yan back to Wood Spirit Peak to await Zhuge Wan's summons.  

Over the next few days, the entire peak buzzed with visible activity.  

Whispers spread that Peak Master Zhuge Wan was about to take on a new disciple—a major event not just for Wood Spirit Peak but for the entire Qingheng Sect.  

However, no one had yet guessed the identity of the chosen disciple.  

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.  

Wood Spirit Peak was adorned with festive decorations, and on this day, Zhang Yan finally received Zhuge Wan's summons.  

He arrived at her cave abode.  

"The disciple acceptance ceremony will take place in three days. Make sure you don't miss it." Zhuge Wan shared many details with Zhang Yan, making it clear that she held him in high regard—she genuinely intended to take him as her disciple.  

Three days later...  

The entire Wood Spirit Peak was alive with celebration. Auspicious clouds filled the sky, spiritual energy swirled in the air, and a long red silk ribbon cascaded down the mountain steps.  

Numerous guests arrived to offer their congratulations—not just members of the Qingheng Sect but also prominent families and even rogue cultivators from across the Tianmu Mountain Range, all of whom had received invitations.  

Everyone was eager to see who the Wood Spirit Peak Master had chosen as her disciple.  

A personal disciple of a Golden Core powerhouse was destined to reach at least the Foundation Establishment stage in the future.  

The Foundation Establishment cultivators from the various Tianmu Mountain families were seated at the grand banquet on Wood Spirit Peak, where fine spiritual wine and rare fruits were served in abundance.  

Meanwhile, Zhang Yan—the center of attention—found himself under the intense scrutiny of the sect's most powerful figures.  

Inside the main hall of Wood Spirit Peak, seven individuals sat in a row.  

Though few in number, their presence was overwhelming—every one of them was a Golden Core cultivator!  

These seven represented the core strength of the Qingheng Sect.  

Apart from Zhuge Wan, the other six fixed their gazes firmly on Zhang Yan.  

"Junior Sister, is this the disciple you've chosen?" After a long silence, a middle-aged man in blue Daoist robes finally spoke.  

"Indeed. This is Zhang Yan." Zhuge Wan glanced at Zhang Yan before introducing the man. "This is your Second Uncle-Master, also the Sect Master of Qingheng."  

"Greetings, Second Uncle-Master. Greetings, Sect Master." Zhang Yan bowed respectfully.  

"Good, good. Since you've been accepted under Junior Sister Zhuge, focus on your cultivation from now on." Sect Master Mo Changqing stroked his beard thoughtfully before retrieving a top-grade magical artifact from his sleeve. "Consider this a gift to welcome you."  

"Many thanks, Second Uncle-Master!" Overwhelmed by the Sect Master's generosity, Zhang Yan immediately kowtowed.  

"You're the Sect Master, yet you're this stingy? And you—getting so excited over a mere top-grade artifact?" Zhuge Wan frowned at Zhang Yan's enthusiasm.  

Zhang Yan: "???"  

He was baffled.  

A top-grade magical artifact!  

Even the most basic ones cost two to three thousand spirit stones.  

Some Foundation Establishment cultivators who lacked spiritual artifacts still relied on top-grade magical ones.  

Yet his master dismissed it so casually?  

"Junior Sister is right..." Mo Changqing gave Zhang Yan a meaningful look.  

A top-grade artifact was already a generous gift for a new disciple—Zhuge Wan's previous disciples had received the same.  

But now, she seemed dissatisfied.  

What did that mean?  

It meant she held this disciple in exceptionally high regard!  

Realizing this, Mo Changqing stroked his beard and sighed. "Since Junior Sister insists, I'll add a second-grade spiritual tea tree."  

"That's more like it. Yan'er, thank your Second Uncle-Master properly."  

"Many thanks, Second Uncle-Master!"  

Zhang Yan bowed deeply once more.  

"You may transplant it from my spiritual garden later."  

As he spoke, Mo Changqing's hand trembled slightly as he stroked his beard.  

A second-grade tea tree was no small gift!  

If not for Zhuge Wan's disciple, even other Golden Core elders wouldn't have gotten it!  

"Now, let me introduce you to the others."  

After successfully extracting gifts from Mo Changqing, it was time for the remaining Golden Core elders.  

Their expressions darkened slightly.  

They had assumed this was just an ordinary disciple acceptance ceremony.  

But with Zhuge Wan showing such favoritism and even the Sect Master offering lavish gifts, they had no choice but to follow suit—opening their treasuries with forced smiles.
