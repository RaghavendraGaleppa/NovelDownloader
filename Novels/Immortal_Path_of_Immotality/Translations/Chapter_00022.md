# Chapter 22: Ambush

After thoroughly searching the ancient tomb, the sunlight streaming through the large hole in the center of the plaza indicated that dawn had broken outside.

Lin Shan initially planned to use his grappling hook to climb directly out through the hole created by Thunderbolt Master. However, considering the large bundle of antiques he had to carry, he reconsidered. If he fell during the climb, his own safety wouldn't matter much, but damaging the antiques would be heartbreaking.

It was safer to exit through the original tunnel.

...

On his way back, passing the arrow trap again, Lin Shan cautiously tested it once more. As expected, the tomb designer was truly despicable! 

The mechanism reset after each passage, releasing several volleys of arrows every time someone passed through. It exploited tomb raiders' assumption that the arrows would eventually run out.

"How many arrows are stored behind this passage?" Lin Shan cursed the long-dead tomb designer while marveling at the cunning of the five tomb raiders who had escaped with the golden bell and Buddha statue under pursuit by the Corpse King and through the tomb's traps.

"Such talents wasted as underlings for Landlord Wu. Once I sell these antiques and make my fortune, I'll recruit these five brothers to help me with... ahem... archaeological endeavors." Lin Shan, never one for modesty, believed such talents deserved better leadership to unearth more relics and contribute to the study of ancient history and culture.

...

As the light grew brighter ahead, Lin Shan, burdened with his large bundle, finally emerged from the tomb through the uneven tunnel. 

Blinded momentarily by the sunlight, he shielded his eyes—only to spot a familiar figure by a nearby bush.

"Cluck cluck cluck!"

It was the dancing, crowing rooster!

"Brother Rooster! You're alive! I mean... I'm so glad you're okay!" 

Having survived life-and-death situations together the previous night, Lin Shan had developed a deep bond with the rooster. He set down his bundle and moved to embrace it, but the rooster acted strangely, persistently crowing toward the bushes.

"Hmm?"

Lin Shan glanced at the bushes and sensed something amiss. He halted, staring intently before suddenly laughing. 

"Which friend is playing such a joke? Why not show yourself?"

Though his tone was light, his body tensed, and his right hand subtly gripped his sword hilt.

"Rustle—"

A black-clad figure rose from the bushes. Realizing concealment was pointless, the man stepped forward openly.

"Agent Twenty-One, I didn't expect someone so young to be so cautious—even leaving a rooster on guard," the man said, removing his mask to reveal a face marred by a diagonal scar.

"Scarface!" Lin Shan exclaimed, shocked to find the assassin waiting for him after his near-death experience in the tomb. 

Had it not been for the rooster's warning, he might have walked past the bushes unsuspectingly, carrying his loot and humming a tune—completely vulnerable. 

Cold sweat dripped down his back. He had narrowly escaped death.

Glancing around, he saw the rooster had already fled. Grateful for his luck and the rooster's lifesaving instincts again, Lin Shan drew his ring-pommeled sword and pointed it at Scarface.

...

Scarface unsheathed his own blade—a replacement purchased from the Nightingale faction for 20 contribution points after the convoy ambush. He distrusted market-bought weapons and preferred the faction's internal supply.

But now, he felt uneasy. Both he and Lin Shan were at the Breath Exchange realm. He had hoped Lin Shan would perish in the tomb, yet here he was, emerging after just one night. 

Scarface even wondered if Lin Shan had simply waited in the tunnel without entering. But the bulging bundle on Lin Shan's back proved otherwise—this young man was bold, meticulous, and even kept a pet as a lookout. 

A worthy adversary indeed.

...

Tension thickened the air as the two stood frozen, blades at the ready.

After a quarter-hour, one figure finally moved—Scarface charged forward, sword swinging.

Lin Shan, however, felt none of his previous nervousness. Having weathered storms and even witnessed immortal cultivators battling, he now saw Scarface as beneath him. Without the advantage of surprise, Scarface stood no chance in a fair fight.

"Die!"

Their blades clashed—slashing, hacking, stabbing, sweeping—each move brimming with raw ferocity. 

Free from fear, Lin Shan's muscle memory from years of practicing the "Breeze Swordplay" flowed seamlessly into his movements. The ring-pommeled sword, essentially a single-edged longsword designed for mounted combat, suited his swordsmanship perfectly.

...

Scarface, a seasoned assassin, was no stranger to failed ambushes turning into open duels. The scar on his face was a memento from a past mission gone wrong, where he had turned the tables and dismembered his opponent.

After the convoy mission, he had spent 200 contribution points to acquire his long-desired inner-faction martial art:

"Three Strikes of the Tyrant Blade!"

Now fully trained, he was no longer the same fighter Lin Shan had faced in the valley. Underestimating him would be fatal.

...

After dozens of exchanges, Lin Shan sensed something amiss. Scarface seemed to be holding back, building momentum for a devastating strike.

Noticing Lin Shan's growing unease, Scarface grinned savagely. 

"If you haven't improved since our last fight, then prepare to die!"

"Three Strikes of the Tyrant Blade—Heaven's Collapse!"

At the peak of his buildup, Scarface's aura surged. His meridians pulsed, his energy boiled, and his entire being focused into one overwhelming slash.

"Strike!"

"Damn it!" Lin Shan cursed inwardly. Did he have to shout so loudly? It made his ears ring.

But the psychological pressure was undeniable. Lin Shan knew he couldn't dodge—he had to block.

"Clang!"

The impact sent Lin Shan stumbling back, his wrist numb and his organs throbbing. Blood rose in his throat, but he forced it down. 

His Evergreen True Qi circulated, soothing his meridians and cooling his limbs—a testament to its healing properties.

Inspecting his sword, he found a notch in the blade.

Meanwhile, Scarface's momentum only grew. His energy surged anew as he closed the distance.

"Second Strike—Earth's Sunder!"

Again, that unavoidable force. Lin Shan had no choice but to meet it head-on.

"Clang—!"

This time, the impact sent him flying three meters, coughing blood as he struggled to rise. His meridians ached, his Evergreen True Qi working frantically to repair the damage.

...

Scarface advanced relentlessly, dragging his blade without a word—no villainous monologue, just pure lethal intent.

"Third Strike—!"

"To hell with this! Strengthen!" 

Lin Shan snapped. Opening the enhancement panel for his battered sword, he made his choice without hesitation.

"Enhance!"

A blinding white light erupted between them. Electric blue energy coursed from the hilt upward—reshaping the grip, refining the guard, reforging the blade, and sharpening the tip.

A new weapon was born.

**[Kunwu Blade]**

Quality: Divine Weapon  
Description: A three-foot masterpiece of ten thousand folds, forged by the legendary Ou Yezi. Cuts through metal like mud.  
Enhancement Cost: 4 Points  

...

Ignoring the panel, Lin Shan swung the reforged blade just as Scarface lunged.

"Third Strike—Ocean's Overturn!"

"Ting!"

A crystalline chime echoed like celestial dew gracing the mortal realm. The mountains trembled, trees swayed, and grass shivered. Even passing geese cried out in response.

Scarface stared blankly at his shattered blade.

This scene... felt familiar.
