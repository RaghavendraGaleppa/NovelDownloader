# Chapter 48: Outwitting a Strong Foe

What made this kid so troublesome wasn't his profound cultivation base, but his abundance of treasures—especially talismans. Although most were low-grade, they had given him quite a headache.

The spirit artifact and the beast talisman had fought to a standstill. Now that his opponent had exhausted his talismans, victory was all but assured.

Imagining how killing this kid might not only grant him a mid-grade pill but also claim his spirit artifact, Yan Tianheng couldn't suppress a maniacal laugh, his expression brimming with arrogance.

Lin Xuan, however, wore a grim expression. After a moment of silence, he suddenly extended his hand, channeling spiritual power to send several ice pellets hurtling toward his opponent.

"Such trash-level spells, how embarrassing to even show them off."

Yan Tianheng sneered, not bothering to react. Ice pellets were merely beginner-level spells—even if a Foundation Establishment cultivator used them, they wouldn't breach his defenses, let alone a mere fourth-layer disciple.

Of course, Yan Tianheng wasn't one to take hits without retaliation. With a wave of his hand, a wave of scorching heat surged forth as a firebird materialized before him.

Their spells crossed paths midair. The ice pellets struck Yan Tianheng's spiritual shield and vanished without a trace, like mud sinking into the sea. 

But the intermediate-level firebird spell was different. Had Lin Xuan relied solely on his own shield, it would have been torn apart instantly. However, before the duel, he had used talismans to set up two additional layers of protection. The outermost water barrier trembled violently, its glow dimming significantly, yet it held firm. 

Defensive spells of the same tier were always slightly stronger than offensive ones.

Lin Xuan's face twisted into an even more panicked expression, as if he had completely lost his composure. He channeled spiritual power again, conjuring another ice pellet spell to attack.

"Struggling in vain!" 

Yan Tianheng laughed triumphantly. What he had feared were the talismans—if this kid wanted to fight with pure spiritual power, he was courting death. Obliging him, Yan Tianheng continued bombarding Lin Xuan's defenses with intermediate spells.

After three exchanges, the water barrier shattered, and the Diamond Shield teetered on the verge of collapse. Though the spirit artifact and the tiger spirit were evenly matched, Lin Xuan himself was being utterly suppressed—on the brink of defeat.

One more strike, and this kid would be finished!

Lin Xuan's face still bore traces of panic, but inwardly, he remained composed. While he knew few spells, ice pellets weren't his only option. He had deliberately repeated this weak, beginner-level spell to lull his opponent into underestimating him—paving the way for his next move.

Now, the time was ripe.

From Yan Tianheng's arrogant expression, it was clear he believed Lin Xuan only knew this one spell.

Lin Xuan remained expressionless. After such a prolonged battle—though he had mostly relied on talismans—his spiritual power was nearly depleted. He gathered every last bit he had left.

The air chilled once more with water-attribute energy. Yan Tianheng didn't suspect a thing—until the next moment, when his eyes widened in shock. Instead of ice pellets, dozens of razor-sharp, gleaming needles materialized before Lin Xuan.

"Ice Needle Technique!"

Yan Tianheng blurted out in horror. The Ice Needle Technique, though classified as an intermediate spell, rivaled high-tier spells in power. The catch? It was notoriously difficult to master. Even as a peak Qi Refinement cultivator, he had never learned it. Yet this mere fourth-layer youth...

He had assumed Lin Xuan was merely rich in talismans. Now, it seemed he had gravely underestimated him—this kid had deliberately feigned weakness to lower his guard.

Realizing this, Yan Tianheng's face turned deathly pale. He had fallen into a meticulously laid trap, and the situation had turned dire.

The tables had turned. Now it was Lin Xuan who wore a confident smile as he unleashed a barrage of over a hundred ice needles. Yan Tianheng gritted his teeth, desperately reinforcing his shield, but it was too late.

His spiritual power was nearly exhausted. Even at full strength, his shield could withstand one or two intermediate spells—but the Ice Needle Technique was on par with high-tier spells.

Had he been prepared, he would have dodged rather than tanked the attack. But now, there was no time.

Under Yan Tianheng's frantic infusion of spiritual power, his shield flared brightly—yet the ice needles were stronger. With a series of sharp *pops*, two-thirds of the needles were blocked, but the remaining thirty-odd pierced through, riddling his body like a sieve. His eyes remained wide open, filled with unwillingness, as he collapsed lifelessly.

"Father!" A grief-stricken, terrified cry rang out. Lin Xuan turned to see Yan Ming—the young noble—staring at him in horror.

"P-please, don't kill me!"

Without a word, Lin Xuan expressionlessly flicked an ice pellet, sending this spoiled heir straight to the underworld.

Lin Xuan wasn't inherently bloodthirsty, but he knew the principle well: *Spare the weeds, and the spring wind will bring them back to life.* Mercy to enemies was cruelty to oneself. Moreover, Yan Ming had seen his true face—such a witness couldn't be allowed to live.

To be fair, Lin Xuan wasn't a man who relished killing. But when action was necessary, he wouldn't hesitate out of misplaced compassion.

With both father and son dealt with, it was time to loot the spoils—no need for courtesy here. First, Lin Xuan waved his hand, recalling the Golden Binding Rope.

With Yan Tianheng dead, the tiger spirit lost its anchor and retreated back into the talisman. Beast talismans were unique—they could be reused until their energy was fully depleted.

Lin Xuan bent down and picked it up.

Compared to ordinary talismans, this one was slightly larger, pulsing faintly with spiritual energy. On its surface was an intricately drawn Ironclad Blazing Tiger, so lifelike that its eyes seemed to gleam with intelligence.

This was the special talisman only ghost-path cultivators could refine. Lin Xuan examined it carefully before storing it in his wrist-mounted storage bracelet.

Earlier, when Lin Xuan had reached into his robes and pretended to have no talismans left, it had all been part of the deception—to make Yan Tianheng lower his guard. In truth, he hadn't exhausted his supply, but this battle had still cost him nearly a hundred low-grade talismans. Though his entire stock was now depleted, acquiring this beast talisman more than made up for the loss.
