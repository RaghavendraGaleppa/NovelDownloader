# Chapter 2: The Method to Alter Fate!

"Thousand Illusions Divine Lord is the true calamity!"

Li Zhengjing gazed at the content displayed on the golden page and thought to himself, "There's no other way now. I can only pin my hopes on this golden page and quickly obtain spirit stones to reveal the complete method to alter my fate!"

After returning to his room, he lifted a wooden chest beneath his bed and took out some gold and silver, filling a large bundle with it.

Now living under a hidden identity, traveling alone with no possessions, no power, no influence, and no background, he—a proper and upright man—was so poor that all he had left were these few chests of gold and silver.

For the entire afternoon, Li Zhengjing carried a bundle of gold and silver on his back and went to the front mountain where disciples from all six peaks gathered to exchange goods. He searched everywhere for spirit stones but found none for sale. However, he did gain a lot of knowledge about them.

Spirit stones contained spiritual energy and were mostly controlled by the higher echelons of the immortal sect. Only those who had reached the stage of "externalizing true qi and opening all acupoints" could absorb spiritual energy for their own use to enhance their cultivation.

Among them, high-grade spirit stones with pure spiritual energy were extremely precious even for transcendent beings at the human immortal level, as they were beneficial for cultivation!

The low-grade spirit stones he sought contained mixed and impure spiritual energy, which were of no use to high-level experts. Thus, they occasionally circulated within the sect.

Even so, for outer sect disciples, they were still extremely rare items, given their wide range of uses and scarcity.

For example, the spirit brushes bestowed by the sect were originally ordinary writing brushes. But once embedded with low-grade spirit stones, they gained spiritual properties, transcending the mundane and becoming what mortals would consider magical artifacts.

Additionally, they could be used in laying the foundation for entry-level formations, crafting spiritual ink for talismans, and aiding the flame for refining entry-level pills, among other uses.

"If low-grade spirit stones are so rare even within the immortal sect, then for those outside the sect—those without affiliations, groping their way through cultivation—they must be even more precious. So..."

Li Zhengjing thought to himself, "Where did that fake medicine peddler get his medicine cauldron from?"

Carrying his bundle of gold and silver and finding no sellers, he couldn't help but turn his attention to the fake medicine peddler from before.

After searching for a while without finding any trace of the peddler, just as he was feeling disheartened, he suddenly heard voices not far away.

"Junior Brother Liu, eight taels of silver for this one booklet? Your heart is too black!"

A tall young man stood there, looking displeased and unhappy.

Opposite him was a delicate-looking youth carrying seven or eight bundles on his back, with three or five cloth bags hanging from his waist. In his hand was a booklet, and he spoke mysteriously in a hushed tone.

"Senior Brother, this 'Hundred Beauties of Spring Breeze' collection gathers the most beautiful women in the world—imperial concubines from great dynasties, noble ladies from official families, daughters of prestigious households, and most importantly, fairies from various Daoist sects..."

"Rumor has it that the author of this collection traveled the world, expended countless efforts and wealth, even infiltrated major factions to observe these beauties firsthand. He had three of his legs broken before finally compiling this masterpiece. It's worth every penny!"

"I went through a lot of trouble and spent much effort to get my hands on this. The cost price alone was seven taels!"

With that, the delicate youth spread his hands and said, "Selling it to you for eight taels, just to make a little profit for my hard work—is that too much?"

The tall outer sect disciple hesitated for a moment before finally taking out eight taels of silver and accepting the booklet.

He then tucked it into his robes and left, head held high, exuding righteousness.

The delicate youth chuckled, pocketed the silver, and turned to leave.

But as he turned, he found himself face-to-face with a tall figure who had appeared behind him unnoticed.

"Senior Brother, what treasure are you looking for?"

"I have everything here. Whatever you want, I can get it for you!"

"You can ask around about my reputation—honest business, fair deals for all!"

"Eh..."

The delicate youth paused and said, "You look familiar, Senior Brother..."

Li Zhengjing's face remained expressionless as he said coolly, "Got any gu insects?"

The delicate youth immediately smiled. "Yes, yes, yes! I have three gu insects in this bag on my left. They're of the Southern Barbarian King's bloodline... Holy shit! It's you!"

"You damned fake medicine peddler!"

Li Zhengjing grabbed him by the collar and shouted, "I've been looking for you for ages!"

The delicate youth stared at Li Zhengjing, then suddenly felt a headache coming on. He lowered his voice and said, "Junior Brother... If I said this was all a misunderstanding, would you accept that explanation?"

"Misunderstanding? You sold me fake gu insects that poisoned me, and you dare call it a misunderstanding?"

"Heaven and earth bear witness! If I had sold you real gu insects, even someone at the Inner Qi realm would have kicked the bucket. By now, the grass on your grave would be three feet tall!"

The delicate youth continued, "Look on the bright side—in a way, I saved your life!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he found himself lifted a foot off the ground, his legs flailing. "A gentleman uses words, not fists! The Enforcement Hall patrols the mountain gates. Don't throw away your bright future by breaking the rules..."

Li Zhengjing's face was icy as he glanced around and indeed saw Enforcement Hall disciples patrolling nearby.

"Fine. Since we're within the sect, I can't actually violate the rules by fighting a fellow disciple, beating you to death, breaking your limbs, dismembering you, scattering your remains, and grinding your bones to dust..."

Li Zhengjing set him down and patted his shoulder. "Next time you leave the mountain, let me know. As fellow disciples, I'll see you off..."

The delicate youth gasped inwardly. "From the sound of it, if he ever sees me outside the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, he'll fight me, beat me to death, break my limbs, dismember me, scatter my remains, and grind my bones to dust?"

With that thought, another occurred to him: "Wait, why am I afraid of him?"

"I heard this guy angered a high-ranking figure in the sect because of Yuan Zhengfeng's entry token. He's bound to face suppression."

"This kid has no future. Sooner or later, he'll either be killed within the sect or expelled and then killed."

"Besides, he's only been here for half a year. I've been here for three!"

"Even if I fought him with one hand tied behind my back, I could still beat him easily!"

The delicate youth's thoughts swirled, filling him with confidence. He sneered and said, "Kid, trying to scare me? Let me teach you a rule after three years in the outer sect: juniors shouldn't offend their seniors..."

As he spoke, he suddenly caught sight of the silver token at Li Zhengjing's waist. His entire body stiffened, and his mouth went dry.

Was this the token for the inner sect assessment?

Meaning this kid had only been here for half a year, yet his external martial arts had reached peak perfection, allowing him to pass the preliminary inner sect exam?

He took a deep breath, then bowed respectfully. "Senior Brother Zhengjing, I was wrong."

Li Zhengjing's expression softened slightly. "To err is human, to forgive divine... Senior Brother here quite liked your earlier arrogant and disdainful attitude. Go back to that."

The fake medicine peddler's lips twitched. He closed his eyes and adopted an aloof expression.

Li Zhengjing grabbed his cloth bag and looked inside. There were three medicine cauldrons embedded with low-grade spirit stones. Delighted, he hung the bag at his waist.

"By the rules of the jianghu, fake goods warrant triple compensation. Senior Brother can accept this as repayment!"

Li Zhengjing then changed his tone. "But as for the five hundred taels of silver you swindled from me, we still need to settle that."

The fake medicine peddler cursed inwardly. "He's taken four medicine cauldrons and four poisonous insects, and now he wants more money? This guy's heart is blacker than coal!"

"Look at you, scared stiff. Senior Brother is a proper immortal cultivator, not a bandit."

Seeing the peddler's pale face, Li Zhengjing smiled. "Consider the five hundred taels forgiven."

The fake medicine peddler let out a sigh of relief.

But the next moment, Li Zhengjing continued.

"Senior Brother won't take advantage of you. Just find five more medicine cauldrons, and we'll call it even."

"Senior Brother, though the gu insects were fake, the poisonous ones were real. They were caught in the mountains with great difficulty..." The fake medicine peddler opened his eyes and hurriedly explained.

"Listen carefully. Senior Brother wants medicine cauldrons, not gu insects," Li Zhengjing said.

"What?" The fake medicine peddler was stunned, then realization dawned. He lowered his voice and whispered, "Senior Brother, do you already have real gu insects and need the cauldrons to store them?"

"Don't ask questions you shouldn't!" Li Zhengjing patted his shoulder. "Either return the five hundred taels or give me five medicine cauldrons. Your choice..."

"Senior Brother... Forget the gu insects, but the spirit cauldrons are real!" The fake medicine peddler sighed helplessly. "These cauldrons aren't easy to make. The craftsmanship is exquisite, and the spirit stones embedded in them are quite valuable."

As if I didn't know that!

Li Zhengjing's expression remained neutral, but inwardly he was well aware of the frustration of having money but no sellers. However, in a negotiation, he couldn't let the other party see that.

"Within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, only outer sect disciples specializing in alchemy, artifact forging, talisman-making, and formation-laying receive three low-grade spirit stones per month. The sect strictly controls their distribution, making them extremely scarce..." the fake medicine peddler explained quietly.

"One hundred taels per cauldron," Li Zhengjing said coolly.

"One hundred taels? That doesn't even cover the cost!" The fake medicine peddler protested. "Forget the cauldron itself—the low-grade spirit stones embedded in them are restricted by the sect. To outsiders, they're rare treasures worth a fortune."

"Business outside the sect is irrelevant. We're talking about deals within the sect!" Li Zhengjing said expressionlessly.

"Senior Brother, you don't understand how hard it is to do business. These cauldrons aren't easy to obtain." The fake medicine peddler sighed. "The cost price alone is two hundred taels. The expenses are high."

"One hundred taels," Li Zhengjing said calmly. "Long-term business."

"Long-term?" The fake medicine peddler hesitated.

"As many as you have, I'll take them all," Li Zhengjing said.

"Deal! One hundred taels it is!" The fake medicine peddler gritted his teeth and stomped his foot. "I'll sell at a loss, just to befriend Senior Brother!"

"Good!" Li Zhengjing remained calm on the surface but inwardly thought, "This swindler is ruthless. He sold me one for five hundred taels earlier, claimed the cost was two hundred just now, and now he's selling for one hundred and still making a profit!"

"If my cousins back home had even half this guy's cunning and greed, the Jia family's vast business would truly have worthy successors..."

With that thought, he added, "I live in the outer sect courtyard at the foot of Ancient Moon Peak, number one hundred and—"

"Outer sect courtyard, number one hundred and seventy-six. I know the place."

The fake medicine peddler chuckled and leaned in, whispering, "To be honest, Senior Brother, I'm well-informed about all sorts of reliable and unreliable rumors, and my prices are cheap. If you ever need information in the future, just ask me. Given our friendship, I'll give you a discount."

Friendship? What friendship?

Li Zhengjing glanced at him but didn't respond. He simply tied the bag of poisonous insect cauldrons securely and waved his hand. "Just deliver any cauldrons you get to my place directly."

The fake medicine peddler agreed, watching Li Zhengjing's retreating figure with a thoughtful expression.

"Only half a year in the sect, yet his external martial arts have reached peak perfection. His talent is remarkable, but the inner sect assessment is in seven days."

"Yuan Zhengfeng offended many people before his death. This kid might not make it into the inner sect smoothly."

"But if he can still become an inner sect disciple despite the opposition and gain the sect's favor, his future will be limitless."

"Speaking of which, where did he get gu insects that he needs so many cauldrons?"

The fake medicine peddler's face showed curiosity. He patted the bag at his waist and muttered, "Send word to Senior Brother Zhou at the Spirit Mine Mountain. I need twenty low-grade spirit stones this month. Make the price cheaper."

——

By evening, under the glow of the sunset, Li Zhengjing returned to his courtyard with three medicine cauldrons embedded with low-grade spirit stones.

After closing the courtyard gate, he went straight to his room and eagerly took out the three cauldrons. Following yesterday's method, he removed the low-grade spirit stones from each.

He glanced around, took a deep breath, and swallowed all three spirit stones.

Closing his eyes, he focused on the golden page in his mind. The text remained unchanged, but under the "Fate" section, new words had appeared.

**Method to Alter Fate:**

1. Currently, your internal organs are injured. You must heal the damage to your five viscera and six bowels within three days!
2. Your current internal energy cultivation technique is incomplete. You must obtain a complete internal energy technique for the viscera within three days!
3. Cultivate visceral internal energy and pass the inner sect assessment!

"Damn it!"

Li Zhengjing took a deep breath and cursed inwardly. "As if I didn't know that cultivating visceral internal energy and passing the inner sect assessment would temporarily save me from being refined into a blood pill by the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord! What I need are the specifics, you idiot!"

As he grumbled, his gaze suddenly fixed on the first line of the method.

At the end of the first line, the punctuation mark began to glow.

With a thought, he saw the text extend further beneath it!
