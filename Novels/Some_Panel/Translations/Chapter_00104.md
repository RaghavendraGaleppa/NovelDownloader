# Chapter 103: The Mist of Death

At first glance, the island was densely covered with trees.  

Ancient thousand-year-old trees such as palm trees, green steelwood, water tung trees, encircling disk trees, agarwood, and dragon camphorwood stood tall.  

Yang Ji temporarily stored the Buddha Child inside the Mountain-Sea Pearl and began flying around the island. Shen Yin, who had no preference between meat or plants, opened her mouth and began absorbing the essence of the vegetation.  

After draining one island, they moved to another. Shen Yin absorbed voraciously, her joy evident.  

With each island she consumed, the green glow around her grew slightly brighter, and her stature seemed to inch upward almost imperceptibly.  

This discovery delighted Yang Ji.  

If Shen Yin continued to grow, the benefits she could provide him would only increase.  

Pleased with this development, he continued taking her to various islands to absorb the essence of plants and trees.  

This routine continued for another month.  

During this time, Yang Ji occasionally returned to the vicinity of Willow Emperor Fortress to scout the situation. However, the Flower-Willow Young Master still hadn’t emerged, as the three Divine Transformation cultivators remained inside.  

He did notice, though, that the lord of Willow Emperor Fortress had entered deep cultivation—meaning he had begun seclusion and wouldn’t awaken easily. His spiritual senses were sealed, making him oblivious to the outside world. This was good news.  

In the following days, Yang Ji resumed taking Shen Yin to different islands to absorb vegetation essence.  

If an island had cultivators, they absorbed discreetly; if not, they did so openly.  

Over time, they drained dozens of islands.  

Then, on this day, someone on Minghua Island suddenly shouted, "Look! The Mist of Death!"  

"The Mist of Death?" Yang Ji followed the gazes of the crowd and saw an overwhelming gray haze stretching endlessly across the horizon. It resembled a towering wall connecting sky and sea, rolling forward like an unstoppable tide.  

**[Death energy—dissolves flesh and bones, capable of killing Unity Realm cultivators.]** A line of information appeared before him.  

"Back in the Thousand Islands Sea, I heard about this Mist of Death. It’s a vast, hundreds-of-miles-wide fog of doom. Anyone who enters never returns. So, it turns out this mist contains death energy capable of slaying even Unity Realm experts."  

Yang Ji stared at the rolling gray haze and murmured to himself.  

"Rumors say the Mist of Death drifts across the oceans like a reaper, never stopping, never revealing its destination. It appears without warning, and once you’re caught in it, there’s no escape."  

"Thankfully, this time, the mist is far from the island. If it had appeared suddenly nearby, cultivators might flee, but the mortals would all perish."  

A nearby cultivator shuddered as he spoke.  

**[One strand of death energy, two strands, three strands...]**  

Yang Ji calmly observed the Mist of Death, discerning more details.  

"The mist isn’t entirely composed of death energy. The strands drift unpredictably, somewhat like the stone forest formation beneath the underwater waterfall. With my golden finger ability, I should be able to navigate past these deadly strands unharmed."  

"And the mist is rolling toward Willow Emperor Fortress."  

Yang Ji stroked his chin, his eyes glinting with a sudden idea.  

To confirm his thoughts, he quietly flew toward the receding mist. When no one was watching, he plunged inside.  

**[Death energy!]**  
**[Death energy!]**  
**[Death energy!]**  

Though the death energy was concealed within the gray haze, indistinguishable to others, it was laid bare before Yang Ji’s vision—like a naked maiden exposed to his gaze.  

Darting and weaving along the outer edges of the mist, Yang Ji relied on his perfected **Zhou Heaven Shifting Steps** to evade the deadly strands.  

No matter how the death energy attacked—whether twisting or striking instantly—he could predict and dodge it effortlessly.  

He was like a dancer treading upon the scythe of death—an unbelievable sight.  

Had anyone witnessed this, their jaws would have dropped in shock.  

After testing the mist several times, Yang Ji emerged with a sinister smile.  

The Flower-Willow Young Master wouldn’t come out?  

Then he would go in.  

There was no point wasting more time here.  

Though the Mist of Death was deadly, it moved slowly—no faster than a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s full-speed flight.  

Yang Ji didn’t wait for the mist. Instead, he flew straight toward Willow Emperor Fortress.  

At this moment, the fortress was still immersed in revelry.  

"Haha, Young Master, our scouts report a peerless beauty on Celestial Flower Island, five hundred thousand miles away. She’s a Nascent Soul cultivator—the treasured daughter of the Heaven’s Water Sect’s leader. The sect only has one Divine Transformation expert. We can just snatch her for fun."  

"Heh, the daughter of a sect leader—delicate and noble. She must be quite the plaything. When the time comes, the three of you will accompany me. I’ll pin her down on the sect leader’s throne and ravish her in front of the entire sect. That should be quite the thrill."  

The Flower-Willow Young Master, pale-faced and effeminate, grinned with a perverse delight that sent chills down the spine.  

"Haha, the Young Master is a man of refined tastes. After exhausting the female cultivators from Qi Refining to Golden Core, trying a Nascent Soul one should be refreshing—purer primal yin makes for better absorption. Still, we mustn’t be careless. Many in this sea hold deep grudges against you. Some have even issued kill orders in secret."  

"Oh? In the Hua Yun Sea, Willow Emperor Fortress reigns supreme. These worthless scraps dare issue kill orders against me?"  

The Flower-Willow Young Master laughed arrogantly, flicking open a folding fan painted with obscene images of women.  

Glancing at the fan, his lips curled into a wicked smirk. "Investigate. Whoever dares issue a kill order against me will have their entire family’s women immortalized in my **White Women’s Fan**."  

His laughter was cut short by a cold voice:  

"I must admit, Flower-Willow, you’re the first person I’ve genuinely wanted to kill. So, you deserve nothing less than death."  

The moment these words fell, the Young Master’s grin froze. A drop of blood seeped from his eyes, his pupils dilating with terror.  

Yin-Yang energy swirled within them, and before the stunned onlookers, his head slumped—lifeless.  

Silent. Instant. Terrifying.  

A figure then flashed into the hall, snatched the severed head, and vanished.  

"Who?!" The three Divine Transformation experts snapped to attention, disbelief written across their faces.  

Someone had the audacity to barge into the fortress, kill their Young Master in plain sight, and escape with his head?  

"The killer—Luo Xiong!" Yang Ji’s voice echoed as he fled with the head.  

"Heh, these fools are still reeling in shock. Third-rate Divine Transformation experts—no, fifth-rate! Against trash like this, I could kill a hundred at the same level," the Buddha Child sneered.  

"WHO DARES KILL MY SON?!"  

A roar of fury erupted from the depths of the fortress.  

"Crap, he woke up already?" Yang Ji glanced back and immediately pushed his sword wings to full speed, racing toward the approaching Mist of Death.
