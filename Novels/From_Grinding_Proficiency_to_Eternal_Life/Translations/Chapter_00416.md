# Chapter 416: The Ascension Ceremony

“Come!”

His right palm grasped at empty air, the five fingers weaving a net of True Martial Heavenly Gang as he reached out to seize his target.

The Subduing Earthly Evil seemed to possess a will of its own, struggling to flee, but was firmly bound by the Heavenly Gang energy, being dragged inch by inch toward Xu Yunfan’s palm.

Xu Yunfan lowered his head to look at his palm. A wisp of Subduing Earthly Evil, marked by dark golden patterns, quietly spiraled there, resonating with the True Martial Heavenly Gang. The two energies faintly formed the image of a turtle and snake coiling around each other.

The true meaning of the True Martial Subduing Evil Sutra had its own profound intention.

“Bodhisattva’s heart, Vajra’s手段 (手段 -手段/vajra手段 means ruthless methods).”

He murmured softly to himself, his gaze profound.

True Martial Subduing Evil subdues the demon but saves the person. This Subduing Earthly Evil had been tempered by the thousand-year resentment of the dead spirits, then cleansed and refined by the True Martial Subduing Evil Sutra. It was now pure and flawless, the finest material for forging the foundation of the Martial Deity Path.

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. He opened his mouth and inhaled, swallowing the wisp of Subduing Earthly Evil into his abdomen.

*Boom!*

Deep within the Dantian Sea of Qi, as the Subduing Earthly Evil entered the Dantian, the True Martial Heavenly Gang and the Subduing Earthly Evil collided like mortal enemies. In an instant, a terrifying wave of energy erupted.

The dark black energy with golden patterns and the dark golden energy with evil patterns entangled and tore at each other, like the tail and head of a Yin-Yang fish chasing one another, stirring up massive waves in the Dantian Sea of Qi.

Each collision caused violent tremors through his meridians. The three hundred and sixty-five major acupoints on Xu Yunfan’s body lit up simultaneously like stars, illuminating his entire body until his flesh and blood seemed transparent. His internal organs were faintly visible.

*Crack!*

Accompanied by the dragon’s roar from his spine, Xu Yunfan formed the Seal of the Black Turtle Subduing the Demon with his hands. As the seal formed, the image of the coiling turtle and snake manifested around him.

The Turtle-Snake Dharma Form raised its head and roared in the chaotic Sea of Qi. The snake’s eyes shot out two crimson beams of light, while the star patterns on the turtle’s shell shone brightly.

Xu Yunfan’s consciousness was instantly pulled into a strange realm. He felt as if he were standing in the vast starry sky, with a sea of molten lava beneath his feet and the Big Dipper hanging above his head.

*Pfft!*

A mouthful of reversed blood burst past his clenched teeth, but it was vaporized by his true energy the moment it splashed out.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes turned blood-red, but his pupils transformed into the vertical pupils unique to the Black Turtle. The burst blood vessels at the corners of his eyes were evaporated into mist by the gang energy flowing on his surface before they could even flow down.

He clearly felt every bone groaning under the unbearable pressure, and his internal organs being hammered repeatedly by a thousand-pound hammer. Yet, his gaze became sharper, like a sword unsheathed.

“Condense!”

He let out a fierce shout, his blood and energy boiling, his bones and muscles vibrating in unison.

The Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil blended together, transforming into the foundation of his Dao, and began to slowly burn the Martial Dao Xuan Crystal within his body.

Under the blending and refining of the two energies, the Martial Dao Xuan Crystal gradually softened, turning into strands of golden-red liquid energy that flowed along his meridians to his four limbs and hundred bones.

Xu Yunfan clearly felt that this essence of the flood dragon, obtained from the秘境 (Secret Realm) of the Martial Deity World, was gradually merging with his Essence, Qi, and Spirit.

The Turtle-Snake Dharma Form let out a heaven-shaking roar from his Dantian. The star patterns on the Black Turtle’s shell and the Earthly Evil fire marks on the Black Snake’s scales lit up simultaneously.

Xu Yunfan suddenly understood.

This was the phenomenon of “True Martial Taking Position” recorded in the *True Martial Subduing Evil Sutra*, signifying that his Foundation Establishment ceremony had officially begun.

“I have started Foundation Establishment...”

Xu Yunfan suddenly looked up and took a step forward. Starlight condensed beneath his feet into steps, and in the blink of an eye, he stood atop the peak of the Ice Abyss.

He looked up at the sky of the Taihua Ruins Realm. The originally dark clouds now manifested the shadows of the celestial stars, with the Big Dipper being particularly brilliant, its handle pointing directly at his location.

The Turtle-Snake Dharma Form manifested behind him. The three hundred and sixty-five star patterns on the Black Turtle’s shell echoed with the celestial map in the sky, each pattern flowing with the clear brilliance of the Northern Pole Demon-Sweeping Qi.

The冥蛇 (Dark Snake) spat out Earthly Evil fire marks. Where its tongue swept, the void cracked like molten rock.

Foundation Establishment in the Taihua Ruins Realm was a true elevation of status, similar to a state of dimension ascension. It required following the method of refining the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil, and completing the ritual of the Foundation Establishment status to succeed and ascend.

The ascension ritual of the True Martial Subduing Evil Sutra was precisely the True Martial Subduing Evil.

To embody True Martial, subduing evil in the heavens.

Where is my own demon?

The Martial Dao Heavenly Eye between Xu Yunfan’s brows opened and closed, shooting out golden light that scanned the four directions and six corners.

Suddenly, his gaze fixed, looking into the distance.

Here it is.

“Where is my own demon?”

The Martial Dao Heavenly Eye between Xu Yunfan’s brows suddenly opened and closed. Golden light like a sword pierced through the void, scanning the four directions and six corners. In an instant, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth appeared clearly before his eyes. Whether it was the flow of mountains and earth veins or the fluctuations of living beings’ auras, nothing could hide.

Suddenly, his gaze locked onto a distant location.

There.

Just as Xu Yunfan was about to take the first step of True Martial Subduing Evil, a figure appeared silently before him.

The newcomer wore a dark python robe, his expression cold and stern. The aura around him was like an abyss or a mountain. It was none other than the Foundation Establishment True Person of Baiyue Peak, Chu Chengnan.

Xu Yunfan’s heart trembled slightly. He naturally recognized the newcomer’s aura—it was the cultivation method of the Hundred Mountains Demon-Suppressing Sutra.

And this aura made his boiling blood cool down by three parts.

It was undoubtedly a Foundation Establishment True Person.

There was only one Foundation Establishment True Person on the Hundred Desires Peak: Chu Chengnan.

“Xu Yunfan, True Martial Subduing Evil, ascending to Foundation Establishment, is extremely dangerous. If you are even slightly careless, others will come to harvest the fruits of your labor. Although you have just entered our Sacred Sect, you walk the path of a Martial Deity True Person, which can be considered the true lineage of our Sacred Sect. If you establish your foundation alone, the Ten Thousand Swords Sword Sect and the Bodhi Pure Land will definitely not sit idly by and will surely become external demons for your ascension.”

Xu Yunfan instantly realized that the one who blocked Li Qingling must have been Chu Chengnan.

He cupped his fists and said, “I wonder what advice the True Person has.”

Seeing Xu Yunfan’s attitude, Chu Chengnan’s mouth curled into a slight smile, very satisfied. He stood with his hands behind his back and did not beat around the bush, saying directly, “I can protect your Dao, but there is one condition: join my faction.”

Xu Yunfan’s eyes flickered, and his thoughts raced.

There is no love without reason in this world.

Especially within a demonic sect like the Primordial Origin Sect, where self-interest is普遍 (普遍 - universal/common). For the other party to suddenly offer to protect his Dao, it was definitely not out of goodwill, nor would it be because “Foundation Establishment is difficult” or “there are few Foundation Establishment True Persons in the Primordial Origin Sect, so having one more is always good.”

The only profitable thing about him was the Martial Deity Foundation left behind by the Martial Deity True Person.

“True Person Chu, what do I need to do?”

A smile appeared on Chu Chengnan’s face. Seeing Xu Yunfan being so sensible, some of his thoughts faded.

“Recently, our Sacred Sect found a blessed land. Coincidentally, the Ten Thousand Swords Sword Sect and the Bodhi Pure Land discovered it at the same time. There are some things inside that are needed by a True Lord. What you need to do is bring them back. That place is also a good location for ascension. True Martial Subduing Evil will allow you to use thunderous methods to forge an unparalleled foundation.”

True Lord?!

Xu Yunfan’s heart shook.

In the Taihua Ruins Realm, the only ones qualified to be called True Lords are cultivators who have formed a Golden Core.

Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.
