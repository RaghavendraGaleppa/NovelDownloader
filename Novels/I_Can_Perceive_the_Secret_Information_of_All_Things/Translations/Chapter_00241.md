# Chapter 241: Nascent Soul Fishing King, Cross-Realm Battle

The Sinking Coffin Lake.

Xiao Ji was clearing the battlefield.

Few had survived the conflict. In the battle between the Weak Water Sect's Foundation Establishment fishers and nearly a hundred Qi Refinement cultivators, all eight of the sect's Foundation Establishment cultivators had perished. The remaining dozen or so Qi Refinement cultivators were now exhausted yet exhilarated as they scavenged for spoils.

Xiao Ji didn't bother competing for their loot—such trifles were mere pocket change to him. He focused instead on organizing the belongings of the Hunchbacked Old Angler while examining the strange rock formation nearby.
