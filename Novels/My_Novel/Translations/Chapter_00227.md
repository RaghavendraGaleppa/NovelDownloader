Chapter 227: Trapped in a Dead End! Li Xian Rises

Ruiciang hesitated for a moment and said, "Enter the city."

Li Xian steered the carriage, turning onto the main road. After traveling seven or eight miles, they saw a towering city wall. High above, a horizontal inscribed board read "Gray Cloud City."

They were still within the Yunan Dao, Huashui Prefecture.

The city was bustling, with tall buildings standing in great numbers. Night had fallen, and the lights were beginning to dim.

The inn was clean and tidy.

Li Xian went to arrange their stay but found that the silver had run out, leaving only a few taels of broken silver. He thought to himself, "Traveling the Jianghu truly burns through silver. After only a few days on the road, several dozen taels have vanished."

"I need to ask the Madam for money. There should be a money shop in this city. Getting some money will make the journey much more convenient."

However, he saw that Ruiciang's face was heavy, as if she had something on her mind. She tried to speak several times but held back.

In their room.

Ruiciang's Qi Lake was vast. Her talent in martial arts was extremely high, and she had learned a great variety of techniques. Over the long years, her accumulation naturally made her Qi Lake far superior to others. But after being entangled by the Spirit-Eating Gu, her internal Qi had already been depleted by twenty percent.

Qi and strength complement each other.

With her Qi Lake empty, she often felt physically weak and short of breath. Ruiciang had been traveling by carriage and boat, and she was already feeling quite exhausted. It was now the latter half of the second lunar month. Although winter had passed and spring had arrived, the lingering chill remained.

A trace of coldness seeped into her heart. Ruiciang sat cross-legged, her brows tightly furrowed, thinking of a countermeasure:

"Getting angry at the current situation is useless. If my internal Qi is completely depleted, it will be difficult to recover. This Spirit-Eating Gu isn't impossible to resolve, but I don't have the conditions for it right now."

"Moreover, with my internal Qi empty, the injuries in my body are bound to worsen. The Five Great Sects laid out a scheme to kill me next to the Dragon Appreciation Banquet. This shows they don't know the location of the Yihe Manor. While I escaped their ambush, I must not leak my destination."

"Otherwise, they would occupy my manor first. Without the aid of my treasures, things would become very troublesome."

"For now, I will travel along the city, kill a few more batches of people to serve as a deterrent, and then hide my figure to avoid their锋芒. Since I, Ruiciang, achieved success in my studies, when have I ever been in such a sorry state? Stealing the Earth's Essence brings calamity; it is truly not an empty saying."

Having sorted out her thoughts, her mind settled slightly.

Suddenly, she heard a knock at the door. "Madam, there is a bowl of hot soup here. Would you like to try it?"

Ruiciang frowned slightly, staring at the reflection on the door. "Although I know Li Xian's background and his temperament, he has never truly been trapped in a desperate situation in his life. How can I fathom his true thoughts? I must keep this matter from him."

She sat up straight and said, "Bring the hot soup in."

Li Xian brought in the hot soup. Ruiciang gave a slight nod, signaling for Li Xian to go out. Li Xian wanted to bring up the matter of the silver but found it hard to开口, so he immediately exited the room.

Ruiciang sat cross-legged in the room. The window was slightly open, and the surroundings were cold. Suddenly, she felt an immense loneliness.

In her entire life, she had many admirers and many loyal followers... but no one had ever truly entered her heart. Earlier, she had some entanglement with Li Xian, and even a slight emotional stir, but it was mostly because she appreciated him as her own得意 item.

Though there were feelings of affection and desire, they were by no means不可割舍.

Her strength was impaired, and she was trapped in a difficult situation, suddenly revealing a sense of distance. Schemes and calculations emerged one after another. Now, being in danger, she truly felt a bit at a loss. This feeling was even more pronounced.

Li Xian had sensed something, guessing that the Madam must have encountered a great difficulty and was hiding something important.

A moment later, he smiled and put it behind him. Li Xian thought, "My relationship with the Madam is like the Sinking River Sword is to me. I appreciate the sword's sharpness, and if the sword breaks from use, I won't be heartbroken."

"I owe the Madam a debt of kindness, but not a debt of emotion."

"Forget it, I already expected that this journey would have its dangers. Let's just take it as it comes."

Li Xian had a broad-minded nature. He returned to his room and practiced martial arts for half an hour, accumulating proficiency, then went to bed to rest and build up his energy.

The next day.

Li Xian pushed open the window to observe the situation around them. He found it strange: "Oddly, today there is no one surrounding us and shouting 'vicious woman' or 'beast'." The "vicious woman" was a curse for Ruiciang, and "beast" for Li Xian.

The wind was calm and the waves were still.

Li Xian knew his situation was precarious, but with his broad nature, he believed in making the best of it.

Seeing nothing unusual, he ordered two bowls of hot porridge, some pickles and dried tofu, and enjoyed the local customs. After eating and drinking his fill, the streets were already full of pedestrians.

Coming and going, it was extraordinarily lively.

Li Xian sighed: "We were chased and killed along the way. Whenever we arrived at a city, we only sampled it briefly. We left immediately after staying one night at an inn. We missed out on many unique landscapes of other places."

After preparing the carriage, Li Xian went upstairs to call for Ruiciang. When he pushed the door open, he caught a glimpse of her fatigue. It seemed she hadn't slept well last night.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, did you not rest well last night?"

Ruiciang stared at him, a hint of coldness in her voice. "Don't ask too many questions." She walked onto the carriage.

She looked inward. Her Qi Lake had decreased by another twenty percent. This trend was becoming increasingly difficult to contain, and it was accelerating. Ruiciang rubbed the bridge of her nose, suppressing her exhaustion, and said softly, "Xiao Xian, let's go."

Li Xian held the reins, gave a "hup" sound, and drove towards the south gate.

They stuck to the main roads. The water transportation here was accessible, the location was prosperous, and several cities were connected. After leaving the city and traveling about ten miles, the outline of another large city appeared faintly.

Whenever Li Xian saw the vast scenery of the world, he couldn't help but feel his heart racing with excitement. But seeing that Ruiciang had worries on her mind, he was inevitably influenced by her, and his heart sank slightly.

That evening.

The setting sun was sinking, and the outline of the large city gradually became clear.

Li Xian supported himself with a cool mat, gazing at the magnificent city gate. Suddenly, his brows furrowed. He saw four figures standing high on the city gate. Squinting to observe, he thought to himself, "It's the Four Heroes of Taixin again. They were badly defeated by the Madam last time and fled in a sorry state. How did they come to kill us again so quickly?"

Li Xian informed Ruiciang. Ruiciang frowned, a cold light flashed in her eyes, and her palms were slightly sweaty.

When they were still several miles away.

The Tiger roared, "Vicious woman, we meet again!" The sound was loud, shaking the four wilds.

Ruiciang's eyes filled with killing intent. She lifted the carriage curtain and channeled her Qi to say, "Last time I spared you four. Now you come to seek death. Do you think I am easy to talk to?"

The Snake stood on the head of a giant serpent, his chin had been cut off, and his face was terrifying. His throat moved, and his voice was hoarse as he said, "If we don't kill you today, we didn't plan on returning alive!"

The four—Tiger, Deer, Snake, and Dog—were bound by their reputation and were already prepared to die. Ruiciang secretly felt her internal Qi dispersing and didn't want to waste words, nor waste her internal Qi anymore. She roared, "Good! Then prepare to die!"

She stepped on her lightness skill and gracefully leaped up. She thought to herself that given the current situation—with her injury and empty internal Qi—her state was terrible. Although she had many powerful martial arts, none of them were easy to use.

The White Snake Sword unsheathed from her sleeve.

Her gaze swept and fixed on the Deer on the city wall. She knew well that among the Four Heroes of Taixin, the Deer was the wisest. She struck with a killing move, intending to take the Deer's life first.

The Deer's eyes held a hidden sorrow. Although he could dodge this fatal sword move, Ruiciang's subsequent few strikes would surely take his life. He thought, "We four brothers were terribly harmed by you, vile woman. What we said before about injuring you was indeed a boast. But today... as the big brother, I must fulfill my promise no matter what!"

Facing the killing sword, he didn't dodge or evade but actively met it. At the same time, he shook his shoulders, and the empty sleeves on both sides whipped out.

He was trading his life for a wound!

Ruiciang had much experience in fighting enemies, but she wasn't calm at this moment. She didn't expect the Deer to be willing to die just to wound her. She said coldly, "Do you think you can touch my sleeve with such a move?"

Her left palm gently brushed, revealing a mysterious power. This was the "Palm Shifts Heaven and Earth" move from the "Heaven and Earth Hand."

She caught both sleeves and pushed them to the left and right, hitting the Tiger and Dog who were closing in. The two couldn't react in time and were struck in the chest by the sleeves. With a "crack," their chests caved in, and they spurted blood, seriously injured.

The Deer's eyes nearly burst from their sockets. He felt infinite despair. His desperate strike was easily化解. Ruiciang顺势 thrust her sword, breaking through the Deer's heart meridians, then gently shook her wrist. A surge of Qi penetrated, killing him on the spot.

When martial artists fight, they harbor killing intent.

Killing moves are often simple and unadorned.

Ruiciang's condition was extremely bad, so she had to save internal Qi, using only basic martial arts to respond, but she controlled the rhythm and intentionally牵制 her opponents. Although her opponents had decent strength, they always had no room to施展, feeling extremely frustrated.

Seeing the two ambushes progress without difference.

All their preparations and plans were impossible to use. The remaining three were filled with darkness and mourned in unison, "This woman is so powerful, who can control her?"

Ruiciang's sword shadows overlapped, interweaving and shooting out. Her figure was hazy, as if covered in an afterimage, bringing up old thoughts.

This was the "Dream-Straying, Thought-Pulling Sword." This sword technique aimed to pull up one's own thoughts, striking within past moments. The swordplay was脱离 of form and difficult to fathom, extremely powerful.

It was originally a set of "Emotion Sword," with continuous feelings of affection, making the sword strikes sorrowful. But Ruiciang currently had no emotional thoughts, which was inconsistent with the essence of the sword technique. However, her talent was incredibly high, and she forced the sword technique to develop its own way. When evolving the sword technique, it was completely contrary to its original meaning.

It turned into frequent flashes of sword light, striking extremely fast, the sword light dazzling the eyes, pulling up the opponents' old feelings and past events.

The Snake saw Ruiciang's graceful and heroic posture, felt a wave of dizziness, and remembered his youthful pursuit of her, bitterness rising in his heart.

Suddenly, he came to his senses, remembering years of hatred. Blood surged, and both arms shot out, internal Qi gushing forth like a roaring狂蟒. This was the "Wild Python Tail Whip," evolved to its extreme. His arms suddenly strengthened several times, resembling snake bodies.

Ruiciang snorted coldly, withdrew her sword, raised her palm, and gently struck with the "Bone-Dissolving Palm." Three palms met, and instantly, the Snake's body bled all over, his aura weakened, and his bones gradually melted.

Of the Four Heroes of Taixin, only two remained.

The Tiger and Dog had sunken chests and were already injured, yet they still hadn't touched Ruiciang's clothes. The Tiger laughed miserably, "Good one Ruiciang, good one折剑夫人. It seems my four brothers will die by your hand."

Ruiciang frowned, suddenly feeling her internal Qi loss intensify. She thought, "That Spirit-Eating Gu is acting up. I need to finish them quickly!" She slashed with her sword.

The Tiger was already in despair, but the strange tiger beneath him had spirit and leaped to dodge. Ruiciang's swordsmanship was superb; how could a mere strange beast avoid it? But her internal Qi was dispersing, her mind was agitated, and it牵制 her strength, causing her sword move to lose its sharpness. It was actually dodged.

"Not good!"

Ruiciang calmed her mind and lowered her Qi, but felt the Spirit-Eating Gu abnormally active, swallowing her internal Qi like a whale. In that instant, it decreased again. It was all because of the battle earlier, the waves of Qi stirring up the Gu's ferocity.

She suddenly felt a chill down her spine.

The Tiger was stunned. Seeing Ruiciang's expression change, he欣喜ly said, "This woman's strength is weakening!"

Ruiciang said coldly, "Even if I have only ten percent left, I can still kill you!" She纵剑劈去. Although each sword strike weakened, her martial arts attainment remained. The Tiger continued to sustain injuries.

The Dog suddenly attacked. The two joined forces and actually managed to stalemate with Ruiciang.

Li Xian pondered with a frown: "Why has the Madam's strength suddenly dropped so much? Along the way, there have been countless strong opponents blocking and killing us. Given the Madam's current state, I'm afraid there will be many dangers. If I... if I leave, their target is the Madam. Perhaps I can use this gap to escape far away."

Li Xian knew that in Ruiciang's life, there had been many tests, and true feelings were secondary to profit. But now, the danger was extreme; it was certainly not a deception.

The Tiger's mouth was full of blood. Although seriously injured, he still laughed loudly, "Hahaha, Ruiciang... you're just so-so, you're just so-so, is your internal Qi dispersing? Good! Excellent! Wait until I capture you alive, then see how I will humiliate you!"

Ruiciang was actually injured, her long sword propped on the ground, her Qi Lake nearly empty, her strength failing. Her shoulder was hit by the Tiger's palm, and her right leg was struck by a hidden weapon, bleeding.

Ruiciang's face was pale, and she said coldly, "Shameless villain, even if I am weak, killing you is still not difficult!" She thrust three consecutive swords, seemingly very slow, but with immense power.

The Tiger couldn't see the key point. Relying on his remaining internal Qi, he wanted to硬接. When he blocked the first sword, his tiger's mouth shook violently, and the joints in his hands dislocated. When the second sword stabbed towards him, his face filled with terror, and he cried out, "My life is休矣!"

But Ruiciang's various injuries were牵动, and she spat out a mouthful of blood first. This sword stabbed off-target, piercing his abdomen and avoiding a vital point. On the third sword, Ruiciang overexerted her Qi, instead causing herself severe trauma.

"Hahaha," the Tiger laughed heartily. "Didn't kill me, didn't kill me.折剑夫人... tsk tsk tsk, what a fine beauty, falling into my hands like this, wonderful, wonderful!"

"Tiger Bro," the Dog stumbled up from the ground. "How should we deal with her?"

The Tiger said, "Such a beauty, breaking her hands and feet would be a pity. I will enjoy her first, then let my Tiger Beast brother and Dog Beast brother have a taste."

The Dog's hatred was fully displayed, and he said gleefully, "Good plan, good plan!"

"You dare!" Ruiciang said coldly.

She gritted her silver teeth; she was truly at her wit's end. Her white dress no longer had its ethereal charm, stained with blood and mud, fallen to the mortal world.

"Why wouldn't I dare?" the Tiger cursed. "You vile woman, do you think it's over here? In my hands, see how I will slowly torture you!"

Li Xian saw that Ruiciang no longer had her usual demeanor. The three were in a standoff, with relief, joy, unwillingness, and anger all showing on their faces. No one was paying attention to him.

He used the chaos to hide himself. Seeing the current situation, he couldn't help but think:

"Madam Ruiciang is trapped in a desperate situation; it seems she has no way out. If I abandon her and let her suffer a tragic end, I would still feel不忍 in my heart. Moreover, I haven't repaid her kindness yet. Once I repay the kindness, I can leave later with a clear conscience!"

"Both of these men are seriously injured and exhausted. I also have an opportunity to take advantage of."
