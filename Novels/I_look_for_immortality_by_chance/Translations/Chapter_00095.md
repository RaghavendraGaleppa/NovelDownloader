# Chapter 95: Jade Screen, Demon Lair  

"Still no success after all this?"  

In the Qian Yuan Cave, Gu Yuan sighed as he gazed at the dim green jade slip in his hand.  

The jade slip was thin as a cicada's wing, cool to the touch, and depicted a seed no larger than a grain of rice. At first glance, it appeared to be a jade seed, but upon closer inspection, it seemed to transform into a towering tree. Staring at it longer, the slip revealed scenes of endless forests, thriving life, rolling green mountains, and eternal vitality. Each glance brought forth different illusions, swirling with profound and mysterious meaning.  

Today marked the twenty-ninth day—nine days since Gu Yuan had copied the subsequent cultivation method from the Scripture Hall.  

For nine days, he had tirelessly studied the green jade slip, yet no matter how hard he tried, he always felt as though he was missing something, unable to grasp its true essence.  

The frustration was unbearable, like trying to see through a thick fog, leaving him disheartened.  

"Is this how a failing student feels staring at advanced calculus problems…?"  

With another sigh, Gu Yuan crushed the copied jade slip into dust and took out the Golden Lotus to resume his cultivation. The copied slip couldn't leave the sect's grounds, and with only one day left, he decided to abandon further study and focus on improving his strength.  

Everything else could wait until after his return from the Zhongshan Secret Ruins.

"Senior Brother's talent is truly extraordinary—reaching the peak of the ninth level of Qi Refinement in just a month. I truly admire you, Senior Brother."  

On a luxurious flying vessel, Bian Chuyao gazed at Gu Yuan, whose eyes shone like stars, and couldn't help but praise him.  

Gu Yuan glanced at her and noticed her snow-white skin and the faint golden light flickering in her eyes—she had also reached the peak of the ninth level of Qi Refinement.  

"You flatter me. I owe much of my progress to the elixirs you provided," Gu Yuan replied with a smile.  

"Hmph! You'd better remember that! It's all thanks to our Young Miss. You better protect her well inside!"  

"Yeah, yeah! If anything happens to our Young Miss, we and the master won't let you off!"  

As soon as Gu Yuan finished speaking, four tiny girls emerged from Bian Chuyao's hairpins, hands on their hips, glaring at him.  

But Gu Yuan merely narrowed his eyes, and a silver dragon materialized in the air, its claws bared, causing the four spirits to tremble in fear.  

"Enough mischief. Show respect to Senior Brother Gu. With his pure Dao heart, he will surely protect me—no need for you to bring Grandfather into this!"  

Bian Chuyao's eyes sparkled as a golden phoenix emerged, shielding the silver dragon. She then pinched the spirits' cheeks and scolded them lightly.  

"Scarlet Fire Golden Phoenix… As expected, a top-tier fire-type spiritual sense."  

Ignoring the underlying warning in her words, Gu Yuan merely glanced at her spiritual projection before closing his eyes to meditate on the flying vessel.  

The journey to the Zhongshan Secret Ruins was long. Even aboard Bian Chuyao's family treasure ship, it would take several days.  

---  

"Whoosh—!"  

A mournful gust of wind jolted Gu Yuan awake. He looked up to find the world plunged into darkness.  

A massive chasm had abruptly appeared ahead of the ship.  

If the world were a mirror, this void was like a shattered fragment, revealing a deep, abyssal rift.  

Black winds howled through ink-dark clouds, swirling endlessly within the chasm.  

The sight was terrifying, yet aside from the eerie wailing of the wind, the world was eerily silent. The treasure ship beneath Gu Yuan's feet seemed separated from the chasm by an infinite distance, as though it could never be reached.  

"Senior Brother Gu, we've arrived. That is the entrance to the Zhongshan Secret Ruins!"  

Standing on the deck, Bian Chuyao pointed at the bizarre sight before them.  

"The Annihilation Realm is separated from our world by a void barrier. Without a token, it's impossible to enter."  

As she spoke, other cultivators began arriving on either side of the ship. Some attempted to probe the luxurious vessel with their spiritual senses but were blocked by its protective formations.  

Realizing their efforts were futile, the intruders quickly withdrew, producing tokens of their own before vanishing into thin air—as if stepping into another dimension.  

"No time to waste, Senior Brother Gu. Let's go in!"  

With a light laugh, Bian Chuyao stored the treasure ship, took out her jade token, and disappeared before Gu Yuan's eyes.  

Left alone in the empty space, Gu Yuan hesitated for a moment before suppressing the urge to activate the Stone Liquid.  

He wasn't sure if his ability to perceive opportunities would work outside the ruins. It was better to wait until he was inside.  

The Stone Liquid couldn't be stored—he could only use it once a month. With just one chance, he had to be cautious.  

"Though… the ruins suppress power beyond Qi Refinement. I wonder if the Stone Liquid can bypass that restriction?"  

With this question lingering in his mind, Gu Yuan took out his jade token and vanished into the void.  

He never forgot that the Stone Liquid was his greatest reliance—and the main reason for this journey.  

The Zhongshan Kingdom had once been a powerful sect with multiple Golden Core cultivators. Even after its destruction and subsequent plundering, the remnants of its treasures were bound to be vast.  

Would they bring him new opportunities?  

---  

"Whoosh—!"  

Though his body remained still, Gu Yuan felt the world spin around him, his head growing dizzy. Fortunately, the sensation passed quickly. After a brief moment of blurred vision, his surroundings sharpened once more, accompanied by the cheerful chirping of birds.  

He looked up to find himself standing atop a ruined mountain.  

Beneath his feet lay the remnants of a jade palace, its broken artifacts scattered like worthless scrap metal, their spiritual essence long gone.  

The tenacious vitality of nature had outlasted the cultivators who once dwelled here. Towering trees had sprouted from the ruins, reclaiming the mountain for the forest.  

Bright green birds sang happily from the branches.  

"This must be Jade Screen Mountain in the Yunlan Secret Realm. It was one of the screen peaks of Yunlan Mountain. The battle here wasn't as devastating, so it didn't suffer the same fate as the main peak…"  

Bian Chuyao, who had regained her bearings before him, was gazing at a distant mountain.  

Gu Yuan followed her gaze and saw a peak shrouded in thick black miasma, like storm clouds.  

"Wooooo—!"  

The agonized wails of countless souls echoed from within, chilling to the bone.  

The once-sacred land of the Zhongshan Kingdom had become a demonic lair.
