# Chapter 11: The Black Wooden Coffin  

"Because the master of Yuanshen Temple—my teacher—has only one disciple: me." Xiao Ji enunciated each word clearly.  

His answer was flawless.  

Zhao Jiuzhou fell silent for a moment. "I don't believe you."  

"Yuanshen Temple welcomes you. You can visit anytime to see if I'm truly the only disciple," Xiao Ji extended the invitation.  

"Good, it's a deal," Zhao Jiuzhou replied, clearly determined to sample the temple's tea someday.  

Years later, Xiao Ji would recall that among all the cultivators he had met, this was the only one so stubbornly meticulous.  

"Now, shall we go lift some roof tiles?" Xiao Ji pointed upward.  

The two of them leaped silently onto the roof, carefully removed a few tiles, and slipped inside the main hall.  

The hall wasn’t entirely dark. A lamp burned in the center, illuminating a portrait enshrined above the incense candles. The painting depicted a physician carrying a medicine basket, gathering herbs, with the words "Healing the World" inscribed below.  

This was the revered Sage of the Gourd, worshipped by many Daoist physicians. Some also called him the Saint of Medicine.  

No matter where a Daoist physician traveled, they might carry no herbs or silver needles, but they would never be without a portrait of the Sage of the Gourd. Thus, all physicians in this world, whether orthodox or heretical, paid homage to him.  

The hall was sparsely decorated. Under the dim candlelight, they could barely make out the vague outlines of their surroundings.  

Xiao Ji wasn’t bothered—even in complete darkness, he could navigate effortlessly, avoiding obstacles like stray sticks or bricks with ease.  

Zhao Jiuzhou, however, struggled. Without light, he felt insecure, afraid of bumping into something and making noise, so he moved with extreme caution.  

Under Xiao Ji’s guidance, the two quickly found the hidden panel leading underground.  

"Good heavens, there’s actually a secret passage here," Xiao Ji feigned surprise.  

"Really?" Zhao Jiuzhou was astonished. After all, this temple wasn’t particularly large or significant, and its remote location made an underground tunnel seem unnecessary.  

Thus, the two descended into the secret passage, heading toward the underground chamber.  

The corridor wasn’t narrow—two people could walk side by side. Lanterns hung on the walls at regular intervals.  

Xiao Ji moved slowly, inspecting everything within a ten-meter radius in advance. For instance, the lantern oil was mixed with mermaid oil, allowing the lamps to burn for nearly a year without refilling. The sixth step ahead had a trap mechanism—if triggered, all of Physician Xue’s disciples would rush to the scene.  

Though those disciples might not be strong enough to handle them both, it was best to avoid unnecessary trouble. What if one of them was an exceptional fighter, or they decided to flood the chamber with poison and seal the exit? That would be disastrous.  

Xiao Ji knew all the traps and dangers ahead, but Zhao Jiuzhou didn’t. Gripping a small hammer, he advanced cautiously. Just as he was about to trigger a mechanism, Xiao Ji had to intervene.  

"Brother Zhao, you’ve been checking front, back, left, right, and above—but why ignore what’s beneath you? The ground is the hardest to guard against and the easiest to get hurt by," Xiao Ji whispered, pointing at the step Zhao Jiuzhou was about to step on.  

Zhao Jiuzhou withdrew his foot and crouched to inspect it. Sure enough, the step was rigged—stepping on it would undoubtedly trigger an alarm.  

He glanced at Xiao Ji, thinking, *This Daoist has some skills. In this world, caution must be thorough—no blind spots allowed. Lesson learned.*  

Nodding, he stepped over it.  

A few steps later—  

"I wouldn’t touch that lantern if I were you. Aren’t you afraid it’s coated with something corrosive?" Xiao Ji suddenly turned and stopped Zhao Jiuzhou from grabbing a lantern for light.  

Zhao Jiuzhou froze, his hand hovering three inches from the lantern. He had no idea how the Daoist had noticed his movement—did he have eyes on the back of his head?  

That would be incredible. He certainly didn’t.  

Upon closer inspection, he saw the lantern was indeed coated with an unknown substance.  

*When traveling the world, one really should keep their hands to themselves and avoid unnecessary actions,* Zhao Jiuzhou mused. *Another lesson learned.*  

Then he watched as Xiao Ji picked up a different lantern.  

"Use this one. It’s too dark ahead," Xiao Ji handed it to him.  

At the end of the passage stood a door.  

Zhao Jiuzhou was about to push it open when—  

"Do you want poisonous gas flooding out at us?" Xiao Ji stopped him again.  

The usually composed man couldn’t hold back any longer. "How do you know about all these traps?"  

"Because if it were me, I’d definitely rig the door. It’s the last barrier to a secret chamber—wouldn’t you agree?" Xiao Ji offered a perfectly reasonable explanation.  

Zhao Jiuzhou looked around—front, back, left, right, up, down—then asked, "So what do we do now?"  

"Open the left door," Xiao Ji said. "The owner of this chamber must come here regularly. He wouldn’t poison himself or go through the hassle of detoxifying the place every time. There must be a switch. Since you instinctively went for the right door, the poison mechanism is likely there. All we have to do is defy instinct—take two steps left and push the left door. It’ll be safe."  

Makes perfect sense... Zhao Jiuzhou was increasingly impressed by Xiao Ji, even envious of his exceptional intelligence.  

"Thank heavens I ran into this Daoist. Without him, I’d have died eight hundred times already. The world is truly dangerous." Then he reconsidered. "But if I hadn’t met him, I wouldn’t have come here in the first place, so the danger wouldn’t exist."  

Testing the theory, he pushed the left door. No poison gas emerged.  

Inside, the chamber was far more spacious than expected. Torches and lanterns lined the walls, and a large brazier hung from the ceiling, providing ample light.  

Various medical tools were neatly arranged, along with a massive herb cabinet labeled with the names of different medicinal plants.  

A pill-refining furnace still burned with a faint flame, its medicinal fragrance lingering in the air.  

Most striking was the black wooden coffin at the center of the far wall, flanked by a physician’s banner bearing the character for "medicine" in flowing script.  

"On second thought, pushing the right door might not have triggered anything either," Zhao Jiuzhou muttered, his stubbornness resurfacing.  

"Look there," Xiao Ji pointed to a section of the wall.  

At the base of the wall stood seven large medicinal bath barrels. Upon closer inspection, each contained a person submerged up to their neck, their eyes wide open.  

Zhao Jiuzhou stumbled back in shock, steadied by Xiao Ji.  

Inside the barrels were the corpses of seven Daoist priests.  

"That demonic physician deserves death—whether he’s Duan De or not, I swear I’ll kill him," Zhao Jiuzhou seethed, his sense of justice ignited.  

Xiao Ji stepped forward.  

The chamber was vast, and he needed to survey it thoroughly, especially to locate the one-stringed lute. Once he secured it, the authorities or the Demon-Suppression Bureau could handle the rest.  

But after just two steps, the lid of the black wooden coffin—five meters away—suddenly slid open. A voice drifted out.  

"Duan De was merely an alias. My true surname has always been Xue."
