# Chapter 45: Escorting the Deposed Emperor to His Fiefdom  

Seven days later.  

At the residence of the Prince of Yan.  

Dou Changsheng stood calmly in the training grounds, waiting.  

Over the past few days, he had used the Qingyang Spring to cultivate the Five Qi while also studying the *Thirteen Swords of Gengjin*. He had also sent a formal request for an audience and received a reply, leading to today's visit.  

After what felt like an eternity, footsteps finally echoed. Yu Yun, a man of average appearance and medium build, strode forward with purpose.  

Beside Yu Yun stood a one-eyed giant of a man, his hair hanging down to obscure half his face. The single visible eye gleamed like a sharp blade, its piercing intensity forcing Dou Changsheng to avert his gaze.  

Dou Changsheng recognized him—this was the foremost of Yu Yun’s nine adopted sons.  

The One-Eyed Divine Lord, Zhao Wudao.  

A master listed on the Earthly Rankings.  

All nine of Yu Yun’s adopted sons were martial masters, with three of them ranking on the Earthly Rankings.  

The eldest had received the most training, while the ninth possessed the greatest natural talent.  

From his name alone, it was clear Zhao Wudao came from humble origins—an abandoned infant found with a broken blade beside him and a wooden plaque bearing the character "Zhao." Raised by Yu Yun as his own, he had fought alongside him for decades, becoming his right-hand man.  

Zhao Wudao stood with his arms crossed, staring coldly at Dou Changsheng from a distance, exuding the aura of a lone wolf, aloof and unapproachable.  

Yu Yun stopped a few paces away and spoke calmly, "I already know why you’re here."  

"You want to learn the *Thirteen Swords of Gengjin*."  

"I’ve studied this sword technique somewhat."  

"The essence of this art lies in the accumulation of *momentum*."  

"If the momentum is weak, even a supreme technique will appear mediocre."  

"As for momentum… I don’t know much."  

"Only one kind—I was an orphan, raised by a military family, enlisted as a boy, and have fought in countless battles over a hundred years."  

"What I understand is the momentum of war—the unity of thousands, the unstoppable force that can reverse rivers, overturn seas, and reshape the world."  

"I also understand Wang Tianhe’s intentions."  

"Your internal energy is vast, and the sword qi you’ve cultivated through the *Boundless Sword Art* can cover the heavens and earth, endless and inexhaustible."  

"It can form a military momentum, like an unstoppable tide—an overwhelming force that none can resist."  

"Prepare yourself. This sword technique is something I’ve refined over decades, born from my first reading of military strategy after being promoted to captain."  

"Numbers bring victory."  

"With ten times the enemy’s strength, the advantage is mine."  

"This is the formation of ten thousand armies."  

Yu Yun raised his hand, and light coalesced in his palm, extending into a three-foot-long beam. With a flick of his wrist, a sword qi slashed through the air.  

---  

Under the influence of divine intent, it was as if an entire world had unfolded.  

Dou Changsheng saw Yu Yun clad in armor, spear in hand, galloping on horseback at the head of ten thousand cavalry, charging toward thousands of infantry wielding long blades.  

Like a hurricane, they swept past, drowning the enemy in their wake, leaving only corpses behind.  

A single strike, decisive and swift—vanishing as quickly as it came, until all traces faded into nothingness.  

The light in Yu Yun’s hand dissipated as he observed Dou Changsheng’s dazed expression. "You won’t understand it at first glance," he said calmly. "Because this sword technique doesn’t just accumulate momentum—it makes your swordsmanship operate like a military formation."  

"This method of integrating martial arts is something only I possess."  

"Overwhelm with numbers. Crush with momentum."  

"Every battle I fight is a contest of national strength—victory through sheer force."  

"Of the Ten Great Generals, I stand at the forefront—though I am undeserving."  

"In terms of surprise tactics and lightning strikes, I am no match for Marquis An of Western Qin. In formations and strategy, I cannot compare to General Tian Anguo of Eastern Qi."  

Yu Yun spoke without boasting, his words plain and unadorned.  

Zhao Wudao, who had remained silent until now, suddenly spoke in a deep voice, "You’ve served the military council and earned merit."  

"But that alone isn’t enough to warrant my father’s secret technique."  

"With your vast internal energy and the *Thirteen Swords of Gengjin*, combined with this technique, an ordinary supreme art can become one of the greatest."  

"And this method isn’t limited to swordsmanship—it can be applied to fist techniques, palm techniques, and more."  

"My father built his reputation on this, rising from the ranks of the military. It has been his greatest contribution."  

Yu Yun cut him off, looking at Dou Changsheng. "If you want this technique, I will give it to you."  

"Of all the skills I’ve learned in my life, aside from a few martial arts passed down by my predecessors—which I swore never to reveal—I care little for the rest."  

"I am not one to use favors to coerce others."  

Yu Yun sighed, a bitter smile crossing his face. "But now, I am trapped in the capital."  

"I cannot leave easily, and Zhao Wudao is also under surveillance."  

"Meanwhile, the Northern Yang King’s status is too sensitive. Neither Chen Qingyao nor His Majesty would allow me to approach him."  

"So I must ask you to personally escort the Northern Yang King out of the capital and to his fiefdom."  

"You need not worry—neither His Majesty nor Chen Qingyao will harm the Northern Yang King."  

"He is a means of controlling me, my greatest weakness."  

"They would sooner protect him than let anything happen."  

"But there is one thing that puzzles me."  

---  

Yu Yun took a deep breath, still perplexed. "The late emperor showed me great favor, which is why I was appointed to guard the northern borders."  

"All these years, to repay his kindness, I’ve fought in countless battles, large and small—no fewer than a thousand."  

"I have never shown disrespect to the late emperor or the new sovereign."  

"Why, then, has it come to this?"  

Humans are creatures of emotion, not machines.  

Being treated this way, Yu Yun’s heart was anything but calm.  

Had the young emperor still been on the throne, Yu Yun would have swallowed these words, not daring to voice them.  

But now that the young emperor was merely the Prince of Northern Yang, Yu Yun had no intention of confronting his former ruler directly. Yet the need to seek answers through indirect means had become unbearable.  

Zhao Wudao sneered. "The Prince of Northern Yang is a fool."  

"Persecuting loyal ministers, listening to sycophants."  

"This downfall is entirely his own doing."  

"Doesn’t he realize that of the three regents, only Father was truly loyal?"  

"Chen Qingyao may be called Chancellor, but he is nothing more than a traitor to Jin. Over the years, he has gathered followers, recruiting countless martial experts."  

"Liu Qingzhi, to secure power, would stop at nothing. Now he has invited a wolf into the house—making Chen Qingyao the imperial consort. The next step will be for the emperor to fall ill, and Chen Qingyao will rule as regent in the name of the consort."  

"He will become the first imperial consort-regent in Great Jin’s history."  

"A man of another surname, usurping the Jin dynasty—turning Liu’s Jin into Chen’s Jin."  

"That idiot deserves no explanation."  

Yu Yun rebuked him sharply, "Enough!"  

"He is still the blood of the late emperor."
