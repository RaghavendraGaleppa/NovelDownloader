# Chapter 8: Longevity  

Hu the Butcher took out his keys and unlocked the door.  

The creaking sound of the lock turning carried a hint of rustiness as the large gate slowly swung open. Bathed in the twilight sun, a courtyard unfolded before Zhou Qing's eyes.  

Contrary to his expectations of desolation, the courtyard was indeed as spacious as Hu the Butcher had described. However, the moment he stepped inside, a faint chill crept over him.  

Hu the Butcher explained, "After Miss Lin decided to rent out the courtyard, she had it cleaned up on a particularly hot day. They even picked all the mulberries from the tree."  

His tone grew particularly regretful at the last sentence.  

Being a businessman at heart, Miss Lin had calculated well. A mulberry tree this size would yield several baskets of fruit—certainly not something she'd leave for the tenant.  

Now that the house was rumored to be haunted and inauspicious, no one dared to live here. Finding a tenant would be doing the Lin family a favor. Essentially, they'd get a free house-sitter while earning fifty coins a month.  

A house needed people living in it to avoid falling into ruin.  

This arrangement was another profitable move.  

Zhou Qing stepped into the courtyard and looked around, thoroughly satisfied. Though it wasn't a grand estate, it was far from cramped. He could already imagine how comfortable it would be to practice the Tiger Play here.  

Practicing the Deer Play in the courtyard wouldn't feel restrictive either.  

The best part? It was cheap—only fifty coins a month.  

Zhou Qing had some understanding of rental prices. In Jiangzhou City, even in less desirable locations, a house like this would cost at least a thousand coins per month.  

A year's rent for such a place would exceed the annual stipend of a government-supported scholar.  

Hu the Butcher also surveyed the house, wondering when in his life he'd be able to afford such a courtyard.  

If there really were ghosts here, it would be a shame—such a fine place wasted on them!  

"Brother Hu, this place is perfect," Zhou Qing said, growing more pleased by the minute.  

Hu the Butcher couldn't resist teasing, "It's a fine courtyard, alright. Too bad it's been occupied by ghosts for so long."  

Ghosts—people feared them only if they let themselves. If a man wasn't afraid of ghosts, then the ghosts would fear him. Having endured hardship, Hu the Butcher knew that poverty was far more terrifying than any specter.  

Zhou Qing chuckled, "If there really are ghosts, I'm not afraid. After all, I'm a ghost too."  

"Huh?"  

Zhou Qing laughed heartily. "A poor ghost."  

Hu the Butcher burst into laughter. "Young Master Zhou, you're quite the joker."  

As they bantered, both silently acknowledged that poverty was scarier than ghosts.  

Their lively exchange dispelled some of the desolation in the courtyard. Hu the Butcher also realized that Zhou Qing's demeanor was markedly different from the pretentious scholars and pedantic students he usually encountered.  

When Hu the Butcher had helped with the funeral arrangements, Zhou Qing hadn't been like this. But he understood—after such a tragedy, it was natural for a young man to be dazed and withdrawn.  

Perhaps that very ordeal had forced Zhou Qing to mature quickly.  

Hu the Butcher now held even higher hopes for Zhou Qing's future.  

As dusk deepened, the two set about cleaning two rooms. Fortunately, the furnishings were simple and tidy, requiring only a quick dusting.  

Zhou Qing also discovered a well in the courtyard with a working pulley system, making water easily accessible. At least he wouldn't have to fetch water from afar or buy it.  

"The well's clogged with dead leaves and silt," Hu the Butcher said, peering into it under the fading light. "If you decide to stay, I'll bring my apprentices to clean it out."  

"Thank you, Brother Hu."  

Before long, night fell completely.  

The bright moon hung in the sky, its silvery light flooding the courtyard like a pool of clear water.  

Zhou Qing wasn't tired.  

"Brother Hu, I'm going to practice some exercises. Feel free to sleep if you're tired."  

"Is it the Black Tiger Fist that Old Hu the Blacksmith taught you?"  

"No, it's a health-preserving technique I learned from a Taoist priest as a child. If you're interested, I can teach you."  

With that, Zhou Qing began practicing the Five Animal Frolics in the courtyard.  

The spaciousness was exhilarating.  

After completing a full set, he focused on the Tiger Play. Like a tiger unleashed from its cage, his movements grew fierce. His body quickly warmed up.  

In this open space, the Tiger Play felt utterly unrestrained.  

"Long confined in a cage, now returned to nature."  

That was the sensation.  

Zhou Qing felt invigorated, executing the eight forms of the Tiger Play with exhilarating fluidity.  

As he concluded, the accumulated heat spread through his limbs, and sweat poured from his body, leaving him in a state of profound satisfaction.  

Only then did Hu the Butcher let out an admiring exclamation.  

"So, Brother Hu, what do you think of my technique?"  

The eight forms of the Tiger Play could indeed be considered a martial art.  

Hu the Butcher nodded. "Impressive. It was exhilarating to watch. When you finished, your eyes were blazing." He paused, then added, "And quite fierce."  

This was the first time Zhou Qing had heard someone describe the effect of his Tiger Play.  

Fierce?  

Perhaps his visualization of the tiger's essence was becoming more accurate.  

Occasionally, he'd emulate a tiger's imposing aura in class. But his students, far less bold than Hu the Butcher, were easily intimidated. Besides, students fearing their teacher wasn't unusual—at least not in his own school days.  

Now, even Hu the Butcher—a man accustomed to slaughtering pigs and radiating a natural ferocity—found his gaze unsettling.  

It spoke volumes about how tiger-like Zhou Qing's eyes became during the Tiger Play.  

Hu the Butcher wasn't exaggerating. Watching Zhou Qing practice had sent a shiver down his spine. Fortunately, Zhou Qing still had the frame of a youth. Had he been a burly man, the effect would have been terrifying—enough to mistake him for a human-shaped tiger.  

One might even suspect Zhou Qing was a tiger spirit in human form, a mountain lord visiting the city.  

Strangely, after Zhou Qing finished practicing, the inexplicable chill in the courtyard seemed to lessen.  

Zhou Qing offered to teach Hu the Butcher, but the latter, finding the movements too complex to memorize quickly, politely declined, saying he'd learn another time.  

Still, Zhou Qing had broadened his horizons—not only was he a talented scholar, but he also practiced martial arts.  

However, no matter how skilled one was in martial arts, it couldn't compare to scholarly pursuits.  

Ordinary folks who trained in martial arts often found themselves quick to anger and prone to conflicts. A single misstep could lead to severe consequences, ruining their lives.  

But for a scholar like Zhou Qing, it was different.  

Scholars weren't afraid of lawsuits. As long as no lives were lost, officials would naturally side with those holding imperial degrees.  

In such cases, money alone wouldn't save the opposing party.  

To put it bluntly, commoners who tangled with scholars in court—regardless of who was right—would suffer without spending money to grease the wheels.  

That night, the two retired to their respective rooms.  

Nothing unusual happened by morning.  

Hu the Butcher remained somewhat wary, but Zhou Qing slept soundly.  

The longer he practiced the Tiger Play, the more he adopted tiger-like habits. His sleep was deep yet alert, attuned to the slightest disturbance in his surroundings.  

At the first sign of anything amiss, he'd wake immediately.  

The tiger, king of beasts, wasn't inherently暴躁. When hunting, it was patient, calm, and deliberate.  

"Killing as effortlessly as cutting grass, landing without a sound."  

Swift, precise, and decisive.  

Zhou Qing was beginning to glean deeper insights from the Tiger Play.  

His university instructor had been right—the Tiger Play could indeed evolve into a combat technique. The more he practiced, the more he realized that while the Five Animal Frolics were meant for health, mastering them deepened his understanding of the human body.  

The human body has over six hundred muscles.  

Through the Five Animal Frolics, Zhou Qing could gradually discern which muscles he was engaging.  

"Perhaps others don't experience this level of awareness when practicing. Maybe it's because I'm different now—endowed with unique abilities."  

Whether it was the养生主 (Health Preservation System), his enhanced memory after transmigration, or that one instance of soul projection, everything pointed to something extraordinary within him.  

The more one understood the human body, the easier it became to harm it.  

Thus, a health-preserving practice like the Five Animal Frolics could give rise to lethal techniques—a fascinating duality.  

"It makes sense. Preserving life requires protecting it, which means warding off external threats. Hence, 'killing to protect life.'"  

As his mastery of the Tiger Play deepened, a quiet ferocity blossomed within Zhou Qing.  

"Is this the true essence of the Tiger Play?"  

He pondered this as a knock interrupted his thoughts.  

"Young Master Zhou, are you awake?"  

Zhou Qing opened the door to find Hu the Butcher, his eyes bloodshot from a sleepless night.  

"Good morning, Brother Hu."  

"Morning. How was your night?"  

"Slept well. And you?"  

Hu the Butcher scratched his head sheepishly. "Not so well. But at least there were no strange noises."  

Zhou Qing nodded. "I didn't hear anything either. Maybe our presence scared them off."  

He suspected Hu the Butcher's profession as a butcher played a role, but his own influence couldn't be discounted.  

Practicing the Tiger Play and embodying a tiger's aura likely deterred any malevolent spirits.  

After all, wealthy households often used tiger pelts as chair coverings in their halls to ward off evil.  

There was even a saying: "To act as a tiger's accomplice."  

Even as ghosts, they'd be enslaved by tigers.  

Clearly, ghosts feared tigers.  

Hu the Butcher scanned the courtyard. "No trouble is good. You're a scholar, after all—your righteous aura alone could frighten away ghosts. If you become a provincial or metropolitan graduate, you'll surely be a celestial being descended from the stars, blessed by the gods."  

Zhou Qing smiled. "I'll take your kind words. Let's finalize the house today. As for selling my old place to you, the market rate will do."  

"How about twenty strings of cash?"  

One string was a thousand coins. In this world, property sales included the land deed. Though the alley house was small, this offer was slightly above market value.  

Considering Zhou Qing had studied there and earned his秀才 (xiucai) degree, the place carried scholarly auspiciousness—something superstitious buyers would pay extra for.  

"Let's draft the agreement then. Twenty strings isn't small—you can pay me over three months."  

For Hu the Butcher, twenty strings was manageable, but the busy summer season made liquidity tight. Spreading the payments eased his cash flow.  

In three months, his finances would be more flexible.  

Zhou Qing's consideration reflected both practicality and trust.  

For his part, selling to Hu the Butcher gave Zhou Qing peace of mind.  

Though it was just a humble dwelling, it held sentimental value. If he prospered in the future, he might buy it back—at a premium.  

Though Hu the Butcher suggested a verbal agreement, Zhou Qing insisted on a written contract.  

They skipped the official seal to avoid extra fees—hardly worth it for a twenty-string transaction.  

The contract alone was binding.  

As a秀才, Zhou Qing could theoretically renege, but Hu the Butcher knew he wouldn't.  

The Lin family's old estate was sizable, yet Hu the Butcher inexplicably believed Zhou Qing would one day own an even grander residence.  

Beneath the mulberry tree, its canopy resembling a noble's parasol, Zhou Qing seemed perfectly at home.  

"Young Master Zhou will surely rise to greatness," Hu the Butcher mused.  

---  

Next, they visited the Lin family to formalize the lease.  

Upon learning that Zhou Qing was the newly minted案首 (top candidate) in the recent exams, the Lin family was surprised. Miss Lin sent her steward to dissuade him from moving into the "haunted" house.  

The Lin family, prominent in Jiangzhou, didn't want a scandal if the top scholar suffered any mishap on their property.  

Business-minded folks avoided unnecessary conflicts.  

But Zhou Qing had already spent a night there without incident and was adamant.  

After deliberation, Miss Lin instructed her steward to proceed—but reduced the rent to one coin per month.  

A token payment validated the contract while signaling goodwill toward the promising scholar.  

In this era, young, talented scholars were highly sought after by wealthy families. A scholar today could be a high-ranking official tomorrow.  

"At dawn, a peasant; by dusk, in the emperor's court."  

Such was the allure of the imperial exams.  

Earning his秀才 degree had secured Zhou Qing's footing.  

Coincidentally, the Lin family steward handling the lease was the same pawnbroker who'd accepted Zhou Qing's jade pendant. Perhaps Zhou Qing's changed demeanor or the steward's reluctance to connect the dots kept the past unmentioned.  

With formalities settled, Zhou Qing finally had a private, spacious courtyard—a sanctuary for study and training.  

Hu the Butcher had given him ten strings upfront, with the rest due over three months.  

This sum ensured Zhou Qing could afford meat daily, accelerating his Tiger Play progress.  

Thus, as summer began, Zhou Qing embarked on a new chapter.  

Filled with hope, he looked forward to brighter days—and, above all, the relentless pursuit of longevity.  

With the养生主 (Health Preservation System) guiding him, the desire for immortality eclipsed even scholarly ambitions.
