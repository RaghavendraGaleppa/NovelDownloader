# Chapter 42: The Peach  

Just as the red-robed youth was about to put the [Pure Sun Lantern] up for auction, a voice interrupted him!  

"Hold on!"  

"I'm also interested in the [Pure Sun Lantern], but I don't have enough spirit stones on hand!"  

"Could you let me sell something first to gather the necessary funds?"  

The speaker was none other than the same woman who had previously interrupted Xu Yuan.  

Once again, she disrupted the proceedings of the Dharma Assembly!  

Without waiting for the red-robed youth's response, she boldly flung open the door of her private booth and leaped onto the center stage, standing beside him.  

To everyone's surprise, she was a petite girl no taller than five feet, appearing to be only eleven or twelve years old!  

Dressed in an exquisite white dress, she looked like a sweet and innocent girl next door.  

Right behind her, a towering figure emerged from the booth—a giant of a man, nearly thirteen feet tall!  

Clad in a leopard-skin robe, the giant carried a thick, black staff whose material—whether metal or wood—could not be discerned at a glance.  

The giant followed the girl onto the stage and called out to her:  

"Elder Sister!"  

Then, he extended his right palm and lifted her onto his shoulder.  

Standing atop the giant's shoulder, the girl addressed the assembly:  

"Greetings, fellow Daoists!"  

"Most of you likely already know why I, Hu Le'er, have come here today!"  

"The treasure I carry is the very reason many of you have ventured to this borderland."  

"Would you kindly indulge us and allow us to settle our business first?"  

Hu Le'er's words left Han Yue with a head full of questions. He felt as though he were excluded from an inner circle—most of the attendees seemed privy to information he knew nothing about.  

The crowd responded positively to Hu Le'er's request, with many voices chiming in:  

"Let Lady Hu go first!"  

"We have no objections—we defer to Lady Hu!"  

Seeing this, the red-robed youth had no choice but to comply.  

With a flick of her small hand, Hu Le'er produced three translucent amber-like objects.  

Upon closer inspection, each piece of amber encased a tiny, delicate pink peach!  

The peaches looked exquisitely crafted, almost irresistibly tempting.  

Hu Le'er announced:  

"Some of you may not recognize this treasure."  

"This is the [Jade Peach], a rare fruit condensed from the cultivation essence of the Great Demon Sage [Granny Peach]. Only ten are produced every century—truly a priceless treasure!"  

"Consuming this [Jade Peach] replenishes vitality, aids cultivators in advancing their mana to the third rank, and extends one's lifespan by thirty years!"  

"I've brought three of them to sell at this Dharma Assembly. Fellow Daoists, prepare yourselves!"  

This was Han Yue's first time seeing the [Jade Peach]. It was undoubtedly a supreme spiritual treasure—offering both longevity and mana refinement, it struck at the heart of every cultivator's desires. The price would surely be astronomical! Truly befitting the work of a fourth-rank demon.  

Hu Le'er lifted one of the [Jade Peaches] and declared:  

"For this first peach, I require fox fur, snake bones, and tiger fangs, along with any third-rank magical artifact. Does anyone meet these conditions?"  

Her bizarre request left many in the audience stunned.  

Several people called out, seeking clarification about the required materials, but Hu Le'er ignored them entirely.  

Those who needed to know already did; she had no patience for the uninformed.  

Hearing the demand, Han Yue immediately realized that the fox fur she mentioned was likely the white fox pelt in his possession.  

He just didn’t know whether Yang Fan had managed to gather all three required beast materials.  

Before long, a message appeared on the [Illusory Light Mirror]—someone had actually met the conditions and submitted an offer.  

The red-robed youth dispatched an attendant to retrieve a treasure pouch from the corresponding booth and handed it to Hu Le'er.  

After carefully inspecting the contents, she nodded in satisfaction.  

The first [Jade Peach] was sold just like that.  

Next, Hu Le'er picked up the second peach and announced:  

"For this second [Jade Peach], I require two portions of [Emperor’s Nectar]. Which fellow Daoist can fulfill this condition?"  

Earlier, a single portion of [Emperor’s Nectar] had fetched a staggering price of 28,000 spirit stones. Yet Hu Le'er was demanding two portions outright—proof of her confidence in the peach's value.  

As expected, someone accepted the offer without hesitation.  

The first two [Jade Peaches] were sold in less time than it took an incense stick to burn!  

Finally, Hu Le'er revealed the third and last peach.  

"For this final [Jade Peach], you may bid freely. The starting price is 10,000 spirit stones—I’ll only accept spirit stones!"  

The moment she finished speaking, Han Yue watched as the bids on the [Illusory Light Mirror] skyrocketed at an astonishing pace, quickly reaching heights beyond his imagination.  

The red-robed youth lit an incense stick to mark the auction's duration.  

As the fragrant smoke curled upward, the price of the [Jade Peach] soared!  

Now Han Yue understood why the earlier auctions had been so subdued—many attendees had pooled their resources, saving everything for this moment.  

After all, given the [Jade Peach]'s effects—significantly boosting a second-rank cultivator's chances of advancing to the third rank—it was a matter of generational importance for many factions!  

When the incense finally burned out, the [Jade Peach] had sold for an astounding 90,000 mid-grade spirit stones!  

It was a staggering sum that gave Han Yue a true glimpse into the value of top-tier spiritual treasures.  

With the transaction complete, Hu Le'er declared:  

"Now that I have the funds, I’ll bid 20,000 spirit stones for the [Pure Sun Lantern]. Does anyone wish to outbid me?"  

"If not, the lantern is mine!"  

Twenty thousand was already a generous offer, and given Hu Le'er's determined stance, no one dared challenge her.  

Thus, she secured the Dharma Assembly's sole third-rank magical artifact.  

With that, all third-rank items at the assembly had been sold—four of which Han Yue had acquired alone!  

Hu Le'er's three [Jade Peaches] had served distinct purposes, each targeting different objectives.  

By carefully timing and strategizing their release, she had achieved excellent results for all three, perfectly fulfilling her goals!  

Before leaving, Hu Le'er addressed the crowd one last time:  

"Thank you all for your support. Our mission here is complete—until we meet again! May your paths to immortality be long and your Dao journeys ever prosperous!"  

With that, she patted the giant's head, and he carried her away without another word.  

The stage was left empty.  

Yet as Hu Le'er and the giant departed, many attendees also exited their booths, trailing after them in secret!  

The giant moved swiftly, effortlessly bearing Hu Le'er as they sped away.  

As they walked, he remarked:  

"Elder Sister, you're amazing! Granny gave us three peaches to retrieve those three materials lost in the inner lands, but you only needed one to get someone to gather and deliver them all!"  

"And the other two peaches brought back so many treasures—Elder Sister, you're going to be rich!"
