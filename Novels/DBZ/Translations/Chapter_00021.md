# Chapter 21: Instant Kill Method

In the trading session, not all desired items had to be purchased with spirit stones. If two cultivators mutually agreed, bartering was also an acceptable form of exchange.

Wei Qian's attention was drawn when he noticed someone presenting a small black porcelain vial during one such bartering session, claiming it contained venom from a highly poisonous snake. This immediately piqued his interest, and he approached the man.

"Fellow Daoist, how much for that vial of venom?" Wei Qian inquired.

"I'm not selling, only bartering," the cultivator replied.

"What would you like in exchange, then?" Wei Qian pressed.

"Spiritual herbs!" the man answered without hesitation.

Wei Qian's brows furrowed deeply once again. Why did everyone have to be so unreasonable with their demands?

"That's a bit excessive, don't you think? No matter how potent, this vial of venom can't possibly be equivalent in value to a spiritual herb. Unless... is this venom extracted from a second-tier demonic beast?" Wei Qian couldn't help but add a sarcastic remark at the end.

To his surprise, the man became animated. "Exactly! I extracted this from a second-tier snake-type demonic beast."

Their conversation wasn't hushed, and every word was clearly heard by the surrounding cultivators. Some chuckled dismissively, while others couldn't resist commenting, "Fellow Daoist, there should be limits to how far you can stretch the truth."

"You're only at the fifth level of Qi Refinement. How could you possibly extract venom from a second-tier snake demon? Did the snake just fall from the sky or something?"

Unexpectedly, the man doubled down on his claim. Even Wei Qian found it hard to maintain his composure at this point.

Under the skeptical gazes of the crowd, the cultivator insisted, "I'm not lying. That day, I entered the Demonic Beast Mountain Range searching for treasures when suddenly a golden light flashed across the sky, and a section of a snake's corpse fell right in front of me."

"I didn't dare take the entire corpse, so I just collected the venom from its mouth."

No one believed him.

"Keep spinning your tales. To instantly kill a second-tier demonic beast—equivalent to a Foundation Establishment cultivator—even a late-stage Foundation Establishment expert might not be able to do that."

"To accomplish it so effortlessly, it must have been a Golden Core True Person. Did you happen to run into one of the Liuyun Sect's Grand Elders or the Patriarch of the Alchemy Cauldron Xiao Family?"

The crowd burst into laughter. However, Wei Qian's expression gradually softened. The man seemed genuinely earnest, as if he wasn't lying—though it was still possible he was just an exceptional actor.

Wei Qian pulled the man aside and quietly asked what kind of spiritual herb he wanted in exchange.

"Just a mid-grade first-tier spiritual herb will do."

Wei Qian thought for a moment. "Then you'll have to demonstrate the venom's potency for me. Empty words won't convince me."

The vial had likely been sitting unsold for a while, as the cultivator's resolve visibly wavered. Seizing the opportunity, Wei Qian took out a jade box containing a spiritual herb and waved it slightly.

"Just one drop!" the man said with a pained expression.

"If I'm satisfied, you'll get your due."

With that, Wei Qian began inspecting the goods. He opened the black porcelain vial and, channeling his spiritual energy, extracted a single drop of venom. He then produced a jade slip from his storage pouch and let the venom drip onto it.

A sharp hissing sound followed as wisps of green smoke rose—the venom had corroded a small portion of the jade slip. Considering how durable jade slips were—impervious to ordinary blades, flames, and even requiring significant effort from Qi Refinement cultivators to destroy—this was no small feat.

"See? I wasn't lying," the cultivator said.

Wei Qian nodded in acknowledgment. Still, he wasn't about to hand over a mid-grade first-tier spiritual herb so easily. What followed was an intense bargaining session.

In the end, Wei Qian parted with a spiritual herb stored in a jade box, while the cultivator handed over the black porcelain vial of venom and even threw in an extra fifty low-grade spirit stones as compensation.

Wei Qian was in high spirits as he pocketed the vial. "For an ordinary cultivator, this trade would be a loss."

"But for me, with the power of the [Wish-Dragon Pearl] to turn the mundane into the extraordinary, this is a profitable deal!"

Acquiring what was likely venom from a second-tier snake demon gave Wei Qian an idea.

Upon returning to his residence, he fetched a small white jade bowl, filled it with water infused with faint spiritual energy, and carefully added five drops of venom. The venom was highly corrosive, so dilution was necessary—otherwise, directly dipping his Frostlight Needle into the vial risked damaging the artifact before it could even be properly poisoned.

Over the next few days, Wei Qian gradually adjusted the ratio of venom to spiritual water, ensuring the mixture was neither too corrosive nor too diluted. Five days later, he finally submerged the Frostlight Needle—now fully refined and responsive to his will—into the bowl to begin the poisoning process.

At the same time, he started accumulating wish energy. Focusing inward, his consciousness descended into the chaotic space within his spiritual sea, where the [Wish-Dragon Pearl] resided.

Without hesitation, he made his wish: "Dragon Pearl, I wish for the poisoned Frostlight Needle to be potent enough to instantly kill an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator."

That's right—Wei Qian had set his sights a full major realm higher! If the pearl demanded an exorbitant number of days, he would simply adjust his wish the next day.

Back in his residence, Wei Qian slowly opened his eyes, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Not bad. Only a hundred days—just over three months. That's manageable."

His initial estimate had given him roughly half a year to prepare, meaning he could afford two wishes in that time. For a fourth-level Qi Refinement cultivator to possess a means of instantly killing an early-stage Foundation Establishment expert—even the Li Family's Foundation Establishment ancestor likely didn't have such a capability.

"Aside from wishing, I can't neglect my own cultivation," Wei Qian reminded himself. Though he could sense the bottleneck to the fifth level of Qi Refinement, he couldn't guarantee a breakthrough within six months.

"So, where does Li Wanqing's confidence come from?" Wei Qian's thoughts turned to the Wanqing Elder. Under normal circumstances, six months would only be enough for Li Wanqing—who had recently broken through to the ninth level of Qi Refinement—to stabilize his cultivation. How could he be so sure of advancing another step to the tenth level, the Great Perfection stage?

"Never mind. Everything will be clear in six months." Shaking his head, Wei Qian dismissed the thought.

With the remaining sixty-two low-grade spirit stones, he purchased a batch of Yellow Sprout Pills. With the aid of medicinal pills, breaking through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement within half a year wasn't impossible!
