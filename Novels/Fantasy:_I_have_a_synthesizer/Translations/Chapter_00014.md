# Chapter Fourteen: Spirit Weapon, Hurricane Blade! The Emissary Arrives!

Carrying an excited heart, Su Yu opened the synthesis panel.
Sure enough, beneath the synthesis panel, a purple radiance flickered.
Rare Item!
Su Yu held his breath. Although he didn't know what a rare item was, anything designated as a rare item by the synthesis panel surely wasn't ordinary.
Su Yu cautiously clicked on the rare item that glowed with purple light.
Instantly, a purple egg appeared in Su Yu's hand.
As the purple egg appeared, the purple radiance in the rare item slot disappeared, replaced by a progress bar.
"1/200"
"Does the next rare item require 200 Luck points? So, each time a rare item appears, the Luck needed for the next one doubles?"
Su Yu mused thoughtfully.
"Never mind that for now, the most important thing is, what exactly is this purple egg?"
Su Yu's gaze fell upon the purple egg. Before he could observe it closely, a message automatically appeared in his mind.
"Ding! A rare item egg has been detected. Would you like to open it?"
Su Yu's brow twitched slightly.

It was only upon reaching the Visceral Refinement Realm that one began to temper their internal organs, thereby becoming capable of absorbing spiritual energy from the heavens and earth to strengthen their entire body.
One could say that only by reaching the Visceral Refinement Realm did one truly embark on the path of a powerful expert!
And the scarcity of Visceral Refinement Realm experts was evident: in the entirety of Heng City, besides the elusive Guild Master of the Martial Artist Association, only Liu Kuang was a martial artist of this realm.
This highlighted the difficulty of reaching the Visceral Refinement Realm.
As for Spirit Weapons, they were even rarer.
Even a martial artist in the Visceral Refinement Realm might not possess a Spirit Weapon.

Su Yu's breathing grew incredibly fervent. Even if he couldn't unleash the full power of the Hurricane Blade right now, its inherent strength alone would undoubtedly cause his combat power to surge once more!
If before, it took him three moves to kill three martial artists with Blood Qi 3,
then now, he would only need one move!
"As expected of a rare item, even the synthesis panel said so! I've struck gold!"
Su Yu was incredibly excited.
Afterward, he carefully put away the Hurricane Blade. Such a treasure could only be used as a trump card; if someone sharp-eyed were to spot it, he would inevitably run into trouble.
After all, this was a treasure coveted even by Visceral Refinement Realm martial artists!
After hiding the Hurricane Blade, Su Yu then took out the Marrow Refinement Pill he had previously synthesized.
He saw that the white-jade-like Marrow Refinement Pill glowed faintly, shimmering in ripples.

One punch, nearly nine thousand kilograms!
Seeing this, Su Yu couldn't help but smile.
"My Blood Qi has successfully reached 6, and my strength has also increased, almost nine thousand kilograms. If I go all out, even a late-stage Blood Qi Realm expert might not be able to match me."
"And if I add my Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist, as long as it's not a Blood Tempering Realm martial artist attacking, I have a certain degree of self-preservation!"
At this moment, Su Yu genuinely smiled from the bottom of his heart.
If before, he was considered a nobody, then now, Su Yu had truly entered the upper echelons of Heng City!
One must know that throughout Heng City, there were no more than twenty Blood Tempering Realm martial artists!
This showed just how formidable Su Yu currently was!
Su Yu pushed open the window, looked at the hazy world outside, then checked the time and murmured to himself.
