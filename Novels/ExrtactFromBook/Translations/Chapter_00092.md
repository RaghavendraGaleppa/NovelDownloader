# Chapter 90: Entering the City

Han waved his hand, storing the small piece of [Gold-Devouring Honey] into his [Silver Hairpin] and placing the queen bee's corpse into his long-unused corpse storage bag. The other two large chunks of [Gold-Devouring Honey] were too bulky for him to carry, so he entrusted them to Wubing to carry on his back.

Having devoured several first-tier [Gold-Devouring Bees], Wubing's belly was round and full. Happily grunting, the bear shouldered the two large honeycombs with visible delight. This was the greatest harvest he'd ever made since roaming the Golden Blade Gorge.

"My lord, let me take you to Ironbite City. We have specialized fire chambers there where we can refine this [Gold-Devouring Honey] to make it even more delicious!"

"Sounds good, let's go." Han had no objections. After all, his purpose in descending the mountain was to gain experience and broaden his horizons—it wouldn't hurt to see the customs of the Reed Continent.

Wubing carried the two large honeycombs as they hurried onward. Despite the heavier load, the bear moved significantly faster on the return journey, driven by his own little scheme—one he kept to himself. These two honeycombs were priceless treasures, undeniable proof of strength and luck. Carrying them back would earn him immense face!

Eager to return home and show off, Wubing raced ahead, barely able to contain his desire to flaunt his success. Before long, they reached a boundary of the Golden Blade Gorge where Han noticed a carved staircase leading down to the Flaming Mountains.

Familiar with the terrain, Wubing nimbly hopped down the steps and soon reached the base of the mountains. The area near the Golden Blade Waterfall was surrounded by dormant volcanoes, so the temperature remained normal. Wubing carried Han westward, and before long, a massive steel city built around a lake came into view.

Ironbite City had arrived!

The city was constructed around a colossal active volcano at its center, its peak glowing red and spewing black smoke. The hundred-zhang-tall walls were entirely made of metal, forming a perfect circle around the volcano. Within these walls, stretching all the way up the volcano, stood countless metal buildings, each with towering chimneys belching white smoke.

As they approached the city, Wubing slowed his pace, walking steadily toward the gates. Surrounding the walls were vast golden rice fields, growing the Flaming Mountains' specialty—[Golden Tooth Rice], a first-tier spiritual grain where a single grain could sustain a person for an entire day. This was a crucial food source for the region.

In the fields, laborers could be seen, though they were sparse—only one worker per vast stretch of land. As man and bear walked the main road to the city gates, they encountered many travelers, all lean and long-limbed. Wubing blended seamlessly into the crowd as they made their way forward.

Midway, a mounted party abruptly emerged from the city. Leading them was a panda twice Wubing's size, its back fitted with a metal frame carrying a muscular cultivator. Behind followed a troop of black-horned, red-skinned oxen, each also bearing a metal frame with a cultivator astride. The group exuded an imposing aura—except for one odd detail.

Every burly cultivator carried a massive golden salted fish on their back. The leader, in particular, held one in hand, waving it dramatically. Though Han knew these were artifacts forged from [Golden Blade Swordfish], powerful and of excellent quality, he still found the sight jarring.

The group soon crossed paths with Han and Wubing. The large panda halted and lowered its head to speak. "Uncle, you're back. Finally found yourself a rider?"

"Ah, Rui! Off to hunt [Fire Dragon Earthworms] again? Be careful! I've got two chunks of [Gold-Devouring Honey] here—taking them straight to the fire chamber for refining!" Wubing boasted without hesitation, making Han smirk at the bear's lack of subtlety. Moreover, this panda, twice Wubing's size, was actually its nephew. Han was beginning to grasp Wubing's standing in the family.

The cultivator on Rui's back nodded at Han before brandishing his swordfish and leading the party away. With no further interruptions, man and bear passed through the towering gates into Ironbite City.

The city bustled with humans and beasts coexisting. The architecture was clearly designed to accommodate the larger physiques of spirit beasts—wide roads and mostly single-story buildings with spacious courtyards, many equipped with sheds for beasts to rest.

Wubing carried Han through winding streets until they reached a large compound at the foot of the volcano. The moment they entered the courtyard, the bear bellowed:

"Master Chen! Come out—I've got a big job for you!" With that, it shook its fur, dropping the two heavy honeycombs onto the ground as Han dismounted beside it.

A white-haired, heavily muscled elder emerged from the house, remarking as he walked, "Wubing, it's rare for you to bring in something substantial!"

"Elder Chen, I'm here to refine [Gold-Devouring Honey] for this lord. Isn't that a big job?" Wubing said proudly.

The elder, surnamed Chen, nodded at Han before inspecting the honeycombs. "Fine quality, and not from Gold-Devourer City. I can refine these." He then bowed slightly to Han. "You must be a visitor, friend. I am Chen Zhong, elder of the Chen Family overseeing this fire chamber. May I know your name?"

"I am Yuanchu, traveling through Ironbite City. I appreciate your hospitality." Han returned the courtesy.

Chen Zhong continued, "These two honeycombs can yield five doses of elixir—each enabling the comprehension of a [Toxin Resistance] ability. The refining time depends on the grade of flame used. With a third-tier spiritual flame, it will take only a day, and you may collect it tomorrow. However, the cost is high—we would take one dose as payment. If you opt for a second-tier flame, it would take three months but cost only a tenth as much. The potency would be marginally weaker with the second-tier flame, though the difference is negligible. What would you prefer?"

Without hesitation, Han replied, "I'll take the third-tier flame. I'll return tomorrow to collect it. Thank you, Elder Chen."
