# Chapter 226: The Lost Scepter  

Sanji Dao finally remembered why he had originally come to the Valley of Dread.  

It was for a scepter.  

After killing a minor demon, he had found a treasure map among the loot it dropped. The map led to an abandoned temple within the Valley of Dread, where a powerful scepter was said to be hidden.  

Though he still carried three blades on his back, Sanji Dao had recently changed his profession—he was now a mage. The desire for an exceptional scepter burned fiercely within him.
