# Chapter 26: Flame Serpent Swarm

Seeing Yang Ji agree to descend, Huo Yuan's face showed a worried expression. He had clearly discerned Chang Lin's coercive intent and transmitted his voice, saying, "Master, if you go down, there might be danger."

"There's danger even if I don't go down," Yang Ji glanced at Chang Lin, shook his head slightly, and transmitted his voice back, "You stay on the boat."

Then he looked at everyone and smiled, "Since everyone is ready, let's go down then."

"Good, little friend, please lead the way. Let's quickly hunt down that demonic beast, lest Fellow Daoist Huo gets anxious waiting," Chang Lin said with a beaming smile that felt like a spring breeze, making him appear far from righteous.

But Yang Ji knew he was a wolf in sheep's clothing. His gaze swept over Chen De, who also wore a smile, and he couldn't help but sigh: those who smiled kindly might not be kind at all.

Yang Ji quickly retracted his gaze, took out his Water Skiff with a flick of his hand, and was the first to leap into the sea.

Chang Lin, Chen De, and the others exchanged glances, then also took out their Water Skiffs. With several splashes, they entered the water, following Yang Ji's lead.

Before long, the group of eight stopped above the dormant volcano's crater.

"That demonic beast is hidden below here," Yang Ji pointed at the dark, deep opening. After a glance, he immediately steered his Water Skiff straight into it.

With a faint 'pop' sound, the Water Skiff passed through an air barrier and quickly landed at the bottom of the volcano, which was not flooded by seawater.

Perhaps due to the barrier, Yang Ji could see the seawater above the opening slowly flowing, yet not a single drop seeped down.

He put away his Water Skiff and looked around, finding numerous crisscrossing passages below, extending in all directions. Every inch of the air was filled with visible red heatwaves.

The earth as far as the eye could see was baked crimson and brittle. Along these passages, there was almost a small magma pit every three zhang and a large one every ten zhang.

Inside, the fiery red magma 'gurgled' and bubbled, releasing plumes of heat and pungent sulfurous fumes.

The terrifying high temperature caused Yang Ji's spiritual energy circulation to become sluggish.

Seeing this, he quickly took out "Ice Clarity Liquid" and consumed it.

Just then, Chang Lin and the others broke through the barrier and descended.

Their gazes were filled with curiosity but also alertness.

Seeing the rolling heatwaves and high temperature below, they immediately took action, some conjuring spiritual artifacts, others consuming heat-repelling pills.

Chen De frowned as he also took out and consumed a pill. Only Chang Lin remained calm, surveying his surroundings.

As a Golden Core True Master, he could conjure Samadhi True Fire, a flame far more terrifying than ground fire or magma, so he naturally wasn't afraid of these heatwaves.

Chang Lin then turned his gaze to Yang Ji and asked, "Little friend, with so many passages, which way do we go?"

Yang Ji fixed his eyes on them and noticed that while there were many passages, they all ultimately led to one place: the lair of the Fiery Sun Beast.

And in every magma pit along each passage, Flame Serpents lay dormant.

He immediately fell into contemplation.

Their purpose in descending this time was to hunt a demonic beast, but they hadn't explicitly stated they were targeting the Fiery Sun Beast.

Chen De had merely guessed that their target was a demonic beast possessing beast fire, but a guess was always just a guess; he wasn't certain.

Yang Ji's mind stirred, and he pointed to the passage directly in front. "I haven't been down here before either. If Senior truly wants me to lead the way, then let's take the middle path. This one is a bit wider."

"Good, you go ahead and lead the way," Chang Lin nodded lightly.

The reason for choosing the middle path was that it was the quickest way to encounter Flame Serpents.

Yang Ji stepped forward to lead the way. Although he had consumed Ice Clarity Liquid, he still didn't dare to step carelessly into the magma pits along the way; the gurgling magma bubbles were intimidating enough. He cast his Lightness Art, doing his best to avoid them.

Pushing through the scorching red mist, they traveled for about a li.

Before them appeared a larger circular magma pit, approximately twenty zhang in diameter.

The continuing passage was on the other side of the magma pit. Yang Ji secretly peered into the magma pit. *Inside are thirty Flame Serpents, ranging from First to Ninth Grade, and also a Tenth Grade Flame Serpent King.*

Seeing this, Yang Ji immediately raised his voice a few octaves, "Senior, the passage is on the other side of the magma pit. It seems we'll have to fly across."

*Isn't that obvious? Are we supposed to wade through it?* Chang Lin still maintained a gentle smile on his face, but inwardly he stealthily glanced at Yang Ji. *Little De said he was quite sharp, but I'm not so sure now.*

"Indeed, we'll have to fly over. Little friend, you lead the way," Chang Lin said with a faint smile.

*Your conversation has awakened the Flame Serpents. They have all opened their crimson eyes and are glaring at you fiercely through the magma.*

They're coming?

Yang Ji's eyes subtly shifted, and he unobtrusively retreated behind the others, chuckling, "My apologies, my Lightness Art has just reached mastery. For such a long distance, I reckon I'll need to build up momentum to fly across."

"Seniors, please step aside. I'm about to make my dash."

Just as his words fell, the magma in the pit instantly began to 'gurgle gurgle' and boil, forming large magma bubbles.

Immediately after, Chang Lin narrowed his eyes and said in a deep voice, "There's movement in the magma."

The others also sensed something amiss. As they stared intently, they quickly took out their spiritual artifacts, preparing for battle.

The next moment.

*Boom! Boom! Boom!*

The magma exploded.

One by one, Flame Serpents, their bodies covered in hard yellow scales and heads triangular, shot out like arrows.

They opened their gaping, tearing mouths, revealing sharp fangs, incredibly ferocious, as if wanting to swallow everyone whole.

But it wasn't over yet.

Soon.

The magma in the pit churned and sank for a moment, then with a *rumble*, a massive serpent, as thick as a water bucket and with golden horns on its head, burst forth.

It flicked its tongue, its eyes gleamed with fierce light, and it let out a sharp roar. A sound wave, mixed with scorching red mist, vibrated outwards, shaking the entire passage. Its imposing aura was terrifying.

"Hmph!" Chang Lin snorted. Seeing this, he merely extended a palm and gripped. The surging red mist and sound waves in front of him dissipated into nothingness with his grasp, and those lower-grade Flame Serpents were sent flying.

The power of a Golden Core True Master was truly evident.

Seeing this, Yang Ji immediately cried out in feigned surprise, "Senior, it's a Flame Serpent King! Our purpose in coming here was to hunt a Flame Serpent King. Please, Seniors, make your move."

"To hunt a Flame Serpent King?" Chen De turned back to look at him, surprised.

"Yes, I forgot to mention it to Seniors earlier, but our target for this hunt is indeed the Flame Serpent King."

Yang Ji said with a serious expression, "Senior Huo Yuan and I accidentally discovered that this dormant volcano contained a Tenth Grade Flame Serpent King, which is why we invited Seniors to come and help us hunt it."

"To hunt a Flame Serpent King?" Chang Lin narrowed his eyes, gazing at Yang Ji calmly, but he found no hint of deception.

Although this Flame Serpent was also a fire-attribute demonic beast, it didn't possess beast fire within its body, making it useless to him.

Just as they were conversing, the Flame Serpent King let out an angry roar, its malevolent aura erupting. Seizing the opportunity, it lunged forward, biting wildly.

"Hmph! Impudent beast!" Chang Lin's gaze sharpened, seemingly angered. He stared at the pouncing Flame Serpent King, neither dodging nor evading.

His iron-clamp-like hands, with the momentum of capturing a dragon, swiftly moved up and down, gripping the Flame Serpent King's upper and lower jaws with a *thud*.

Spiritual light flashed in his hands, and with a mighty pull, *rip!* Blood rained down as the Tenth Grade Flame Serpent King, without even a chance to wail, was forcefully torn in half by him.

*Bang!* A dull thud. A fist-sized demonic core conveniently dropped before him.

Chang Lin didn't even spare it a glance, nor did he instruct Yang Ji to take it. Instead, he intentionally or unintentionally took a step forward, casually kicking the demonic core into the magma pit.

Behind him, Yang Ji's eye twitched as he witnessed this scene, silently lamenting that this old scoundrel was truly petty and vindictive.

At that moment, he truly wanted to kick the old man in the backside and make him roll around in the magma too.

"This..." Xu Xiangsong and the other five exchanged glances. They looked at Chang Lin, then at Yang Ji, their expressions growing somewhat strange.

"Senior," Chen De transmitted, "I don't believe they genuinely came for the Flame Serpent King's demonic core. Such demonic beasts aren't uncommon in the Blazing Sea Region. I suspect this Young Yang might be hiding something."

"Hmph!" Chang Lin let out a soft, stifled snort, glancing at the contemplative Chen De, seemingly losing patience. He transmitted, "Whether he is or not, since we're down here, I'm going to turn this place upside down and see what this little volcano can hide."

As his words fell, he transformed into an escape light, carrying an overwhelming, heaven-reaching momentum, and with a *boom*, his speed instantly reached its extreme, even causing a series of sonic booms.

He rapidly moved through the passages, quickly surveying.

Such a massive disturbance, like a roaring fighter jet streaking by, awakened the Flame Serpents lurking in the magma pits of the various passages, causing them to erupt with violent auras.

Along Chang Lin's path, his immense power directly crushed any obstructing Flame Serpents, without him even bothering to look.

In the passage he was in, all Flame Serpents were annihilated. However, the Flame Serpents in the other passages had already caught the scent of Yang Ji and the others, and were now charging towards them.

Yang Ji looked around, a sudden sense of foreboding washing over him.

There were too many Flame Serpents. One, two, three... as far as his spiritual sense registered, there were a full three hundred Flame Serpents.

These Flame Serpents used magma as energy, had no natural predators here, and simply ate and slept, slept and ate – truly a life of blissful ease.

Fortunately, shallow waters don't breed dragons. The energy provided by the magma was ultimately limited, making it difficult for them to break through to the Demonic General stage.

Out of three hundred Flame Serpents, there were only ten Tenth Grade Flame Serpent Kings.

However, just these ten Flame Serpent Kings would be enough to give them a hard time.

*Rumble!*
*Rumble!*

The serpent swarm rushed forward at extreme speed, like a flash flood, causing countless passages to tremble.

Yang Ji cursed Chang Lin in his heart. Causing such a commotion out of selfish spite, he was truly putting their lives at risk.

He was unhappy, and he didn't want anyone else to have it easy.
