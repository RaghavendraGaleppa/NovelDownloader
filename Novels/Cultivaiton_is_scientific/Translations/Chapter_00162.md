# Chapter 162 Victory

Li Shiming opened his mouth and used "Words of Lotus Bloom," singing "The First Light of Buddha."  

The boundless radiance of Buddhist intent emanated from his voice, guided by his spiritual sense, and entered the ears of the nine Northern Shu Qi Refinement cultivators.  

For the seven-sect cultivators who also heard "The First Light of Buddha," since it wasn't directed at them, they were barely affected.  

However, the Northern Shu Qi Refinement cultivators were in the midst of fierce combat when they heard this mind-influencing Buddhist chant. Even with their strong willpower, they were still slightly disturbed.  

The seven-sect cultivators already outnumbered their opponents, and even this minor disruption could prove fatal.  

Li Shiming then released his Three-Headed, Six-Armed Bronze Corpse, fully activating the mid-grade Gatling magical artifact, which locked onto six Northern Shu Qi Refinement cultivators.  

He himself didn't advance, not even retrieving the Broken Jade Sword, keeping it by his side.  

He had already shown enough prowess today. If it weren't for the life-and-death nature of this battle, he wouldn't have revealed so much of his strength.  

His caution wasn't unwarranted—many of his abilities were related to Golden Core cultivators. A single misstep could mean death.  

By now, the battle had entered its final phase.  

The first to fall were the six Northern Shu Qi Refinement cultivators locked onto by the mid-grade Gatling magical artifact. Their defensive artifacts didn't last long before being breached, and they were either directly shot down by the Gatling or finished off by the seven-sect cultivators.  

With six fewer Northern Shu cultivators, the remaining few put up little resistance.  

The battle ended in mere moments, leaving the ground littered with Northern Shu Qi Refinement cultivators' corpses.  

Yet none of the seven-sect cultivators moved to collect the spoils. Instead, they all turned their gazes toward Li Shiming.  

They knew full well that he was the one who had contributed the most to this battle. According to the rules of the cultivation world, the spoils belonged to the killer, and additional allocations were made based on individual contributions in joint kills.  

Li Shiming didn't stand on ceremony. His spiritual sense swept over the Northern Shu cultivators he had killed, collecting their spoils before the others began looting the battlefield.  

"Junior Brother Li, these two storage pouches are for you," one of the seven-sect cultivators said after consulting with the others, handing over two pouches.  

Li Shiming accepted them. From this battle, he had gained five storage pouches and one storage bracelet—a substantial haul.  

However, his keen senses detected a faint but unmistakable killing intent directed at him from one of the four massive flying ships, sending a chill down his spine.  

Fortunately, the formation of Seven Stars Island activated once more, pulling all surviving Qi Refinement cultivators back inside.  

Only after entering the island did the killing intent vanish.  

When he had noticed the Northern Shu cultivator using a storage bracelet—along with the earlier talisman treasure—he had realized the person must have had a Golden Core cultivator backing them.  

He just hadn't expected that Golden Core cultivator to be present. If not for the crowd of Golden Core elders watching, he, a mere Qi Refinement cultivator, would have been casually obliterated.  

"Well done!" Elder Yin approached Li Shiming, patting his shoulder with a smile.  

Elder Yin had gained considerable face today. Nearly all the Golden Core cultivators held his junior in high regard.  

Regardless of Li Shiming's future potential, his performance in this battle alone marked him as the most outstanding among all Qi Refinement cultivators.  

His grasp of sword intent—though only a faint trace—was still sword intent, signaling the potential to become a sword cultivator.  

Li Shiming smiled sheepishly, surrounded by Golden Core elders. Even though this was his second time in such a situation, he still wasn't accustomed to it.  

How could he be? If not for the elders deliberately suppressing their auras, even the slightest leakage would have immobilized him.  

"All Qi Refinement cultivators who participated in this battle will receive a spirit artifact. Li Shiming, for your outstanding performance, you will receive two!" announced Master Duhai, striding forward with a smile.  

This was for the benefit of the Qi Refinement cultivators—the Golden Core elders had already known.  

The rewards were jointly provided by the seven sects, and spirit artifacts were chosen for a reason.  

All participants except Li Shiming were geniuses whose sects had already prepared Foundation Establishment Pills for them.  

As for top-grade magical artifacts, the spoils from this battle included plenty.  

Moreover, top-grade artifacts weren't enough to honor their contributions. Though only one Qi Refinement cultivator had died while all Northern Shu opponents were slain, without Li Shiming's sudden outburst, none of the seven-sect cultivators would have survived.  

The initial clash had shown the Northern Shu cultivators overwhelming the seven-sect forces.  

These geniuses would soon advance to Foundation Establishment, so only spirit artifacts were fitting rewards.  

No one objected to Li Shiming receiving two spirit artifacts. If anything, they felt he deserved even more.  

The rewards were distributed immediately: one metal-attribute offensive spirit artifact and one defensive spirit shield. The offensive artifact, in particular, seemed tailored to his abilities.  

Without delay, the Qi Refinement cultivators were escorted away from Seven Stars Island by representatives from their respective sects.  

This was no place for them to linger—these geniuses were vital reserves for their sects.  

Li Shiming, He Chuan, and Shang Haoquan left with a Foundation Establishment uncle, who pushed the flying boat to its limits.  

Li Shiming understood the urgency. This gathering of Golden Core cultivators was no place for Qi Refinement cultivators—or even Foundation Establishment ones, who were little more than cannon fodder here.  

Seated inside the cabin, the three began examining their gains.  

The five storage pouches contained little beyond cultivation pills and a few artifacts. It seemed the Northern Shu cultivators had entered the battle prepared to die.  

None of the artifacts were mid-grade; each pouch held one top-grade artifact, with the rest being high-grade—albeit of exceptional quality.  

Li Shiming now had more than enough artifacts for the Qi Refinement ninth layer, even enough to equip his bronze corpses.  

The real prize, however, was the storage bracelet. Channeling spiritual energy into it, he found its interior identical in size to Baili Jinyan's.  

Perhaps Baili Jinyan's bracelet had also come from Northern Shu—the patterns on both were nearly identical.  

The spacious interior was packed, unlike the meager contents of the other pouches.  

As the descendant of a Golden Core elder, equipped with a talisman treasure, life-saving items, and formidable artifacts, the original owner had entered the battle with near-certain survival odds.  

The talisman treasure alone would have been unstoppable if activated—neither the "Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation" nor any Qi Refinement cultivator present, including Li Shiming, could have withstood it.  

Examining the talisman treasure, he found it depicted a flying sword.  

He suspected it was crafted by a sword cultivator, though its origin didn't matter—the effect was the same for him.  

It was useless against Golden Core cultivators but more than sufficient for Foundation Establishment foes.  

Having handled multiple talisman treasures, he estimated this one had four full uses remaining.  

Next, he inspected the captured jade seal, imprinting it with a trace of his spirit using the "Dotting the Eyes of the Dragon" technique.  

The top-grade artifact—Mount Shu Seal—was a rare weapon that overwhelmed opponents with sheer force. When activated, it transformed into the shape of Northern Shu's Mount Shu, carrying the weight of a small mountain and pre-accumulated spiritual energy for a devastating strike.  

A nightmare for Qi Refinement cultivators, it was potent enough to serve as a decent Foundation Establishment artifact.  

Li Shiming had only survived thanks to his "Diamond Protection Divine Art" manifesting true intent and his "Sword Demon Secret Codex" foundation, which granted him a physique far surpassing ordinary Qi Refinement cultivators.  

Coupled with his formidable spirit, he had broken free of the seal's lock.  

Unfortunately, he wouldn't be able to use the Mount Shu Seal until at least the Qi Refinement ninth layer—and only after fully refining it.  

Moving on, he found a "Foundation Establishment Pill" in a jade vial clearly labeled as such.  

This was his seventh such pill, making him question whether spending 50,000 merit points on one had been worth it.  

But it made sense—his opponents were all top-tier Qi Refinement cultivators with high chances of advancing. Their sects would prioritize allocating pills to them.  

Better to give pills to geniuses likely to succeed than to ordinary cultivators with slim odds.  

Li Shiming sighed. If seven pills couldn't get him to Foundation Establishment, he might as well quit cultivation.  

He was already consuming several times the resources of others, and his triple spiritual roots were far from the worst—many with his aptitude had succeeded.  

To his surprise, the bracelet contained only around 1,000 low-grade and 100 mid-grade spirit stones—far fewer than expected for someone of the owner's status.  

However, he found a jade token in the same compartment, inscribed with the name "Northern Shu Trading Company."  

Scanning it with his spiritual sense, he found it recorded 1.21 million low-grade and 60,000 mid-grade spirit stones.  

"Is this a bank card?" Li Shiming mused, amazed that this world's cultivators had combined artifact crafting and formations to create a record-keeping financial instrument.  

Modifying the token's records would require complex calculations—and likely additional security measures to prevent tampering.  

He didn't attempt it, guessing the token would need verification against the trading company's internal artifacts to withdraw funds.  

With no knowledge of the company's location or nature, it was pointless to try.  

Besides, he wasn't short on stones. Risking conflict with a financial institution wasn't worth it.  

Notably, the token bore no identifying marks, functioning like an anonymous account—useful if he ever encountered the Northern Shu Trading Company.  

Skipping the stones, he turned to the artifacts.  

Ordinary high-grade artifacts no longer impressed him, though they were all he could currently use.  

The artifact compartment held dozens—likely a collection, as most Qi Refinement cultivators only carried one combat set and one backup.  

A full set typically included two or three artifacts, depending on the cultivator's spiritual energy and mental strength.  

Setting aside the high-grade artifacts, he found a top-grade full-body armor, a top-grade shield, a top-grade sword, and the Mount Shu Seal—effectively two full sets.  

But what truly surprised him were nine flying sword spirit artifacts, clearly a matched set.  

Each sword bore the mark of one of the Nine Palaces—Qian, Kan, Gen, Zhen, Zhong, Xun, Li, Kun, and Dui—along with intricate formation patterns crafted by a master.  

Though lacking the precision of his micro-formations, the craftsmanship surpassed his in other aspects.  

These nine swords served as both weapons and formation flags, their value far exceeding that of nine ordinary spirit artifacts.
