# Chapter 50: Blood-Seizing Grand Technique

【Cultivation from Copying Others' Experience】

【Cultivation Method: Imperial Dao Body Forging Art (Minor Accomplishment): 273/300】

"Imperial Dao Body Forging Art? Is that the name of the Imperial family's body-tempering secret art?"

Lu Xu had no time to ponder; he immediately activated his replication ability. After a flash of green light, a vast, surging tide of experience flooded into him, pouring into his mind. Lu Xu sat in the treetop, diligently digesting this influx of knowledge. A moment later, his eyes refocused; the martial arts secret art was now in his grasp.

But immediately, Lu Xu discovered a problem. "What the hell? This body-tempering cultivation method requires the Imperial Dragon Qi from a Dragon Vein as its guide in the early stages?"

Lu Xu's eyes widened. A Dragon Vein was something that carried the lifeblood of an entire nation. And Imperial Dragon Qi was something only the imperial family, who ruled the nation, could possess. Wei Du was called a "turtle shell" by the Golden Core Patriarch of Qianjue Sect precisely because of this Imperial Dragon Qi. The Wei family's ancestors had constructed a Tier-3 Grand Array within the Imperial City, and with the power of the Dragon Vein there, this array was as solid as a fortress. As long as a Foundation Establishment stage emperor was present, the array was impregnable.

Furthermore, the Grand Array of Wei Du and the Grand Array of Tianmen City were yin and yang to each other; they would prosper or suffer together. As long as one array remained unbroken, the other would also never be shattered. It was for this very reason that, even though Qianjue Sect was extremely wary of the Wei family, their Golden Core Patriarch had always been helpless against them. He simply couldn't break through that "turtle shell." Even if two Golden Core cultivators from Qianjue Sect attacked, it wouldn't be enough. Only with three or more Golden Core cultivators working together would there be a chance to break this turtle shell. This clearly showed how formidable the Dragon Vein truly was.

The Wei family's martial arts secret art had such a significant limitation. No wonder this cultivation method had been passed down exclusively within their family for centuries.

"So, did I copy this experience for nothing?" Lu Xu felt a bit speechless. Without Imperial Dragon Qi as a guide, he couldn't even begin to cultivate this body-tempering method. He wasn't of the imperial family; he couldn't just go conquer a mortal nation and become an emperor, could he? Even if he had the ambition, he lacked the power. Not even the weakest nation among the Nine Eastern Wilderness Kingdoms was something a Qi Condensation cultivator could covet. Had he wasted spirit stones for nothing?

"No, I can still cultivate it! But this will require me to make plans for that Fourth Prince!" Lu Xu immediately recalled a secret art. It was the cultivation method he had obtained from that Black Robe Society rogue cultivator and later traded for the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma.

The Three Yin Art! This cultivation method contained a "Blood-Seizing Grand Technique"!

This secret art could plunder others' vital blood and seize their physical strength to enhance one's own.

"Since it requires Imperial Dragon Qi to get started, then I simply won't start cultivating it myself. Instead, I'll see if I can directly plunder the results of cultivating this method from the Fourth Prince!" Lu Xu immediately slapped his storage pouch, and half a cultivation method manual appeared in his hand. The Three Yin Art was a cultivation method that included contents up to the Foundation Establishment stage. When Lu Xu made the trade, he had only given away the first half, which covered the Qi Condensation stage, keeping the latter half, which contained the Foundation Establishment stage content. The Blood-Seizing Grand Technique was in that latter half.

After a quick glance, Lu Xu confirmed that his idea was indeed feasible. He immediately put away the manual and swiftly flew in pursuit of the Fourth Prince's fleeing direction.

"This guy suddenly invited me; he's most likely investigated some of my background. This is a very bad situation. Let's see if I can use this opportunity to silence him!" Lu Xu thought to himself. He quickly transformed into a streak of light, streaking through layers of forest, rapidly chasing the distant blue light.

Lu Xu didn't know how strong the Fourth Prince was, so he didn't plan to directly engage him in combat. He followed from behind, wanting to see if there was any opportunity to take advantage. From the Fourth Prince's posture of pursuit, he guessed that a battle might occur between Mo Qingchan and the Fourth Prince. This would open up an exploitable loophole. Of course, if his guess was wrong, it didn't matter; he could just dust himself off and leave. With the Azure Wind Boat in hand, his flying speed rivaled that of a Qi Condensation Great Perfection cultivator. As long as a Foundation Establishment cultivator wasn't pursuing him, he had nothing to fear.

At this moment, the area was already in chaos, with streaks of light darting everywhere in the sky and on the ground. Not many cultivators in the manor had actually died in the recent upheaval; most had managed to escape. These people had been terrified, each fleeing faster than the last. In the sky, a towering blaze had already enveloped the three Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Wei family. And from the direction where the Qianjue Sect Patriarch appeared, a massive warship slowly rose from the horizon and flew towards them. That was the main army of Qianjue Sect; it seemed they truly intended to annihilate the Wei family this time.

Tianmen City and Wei Du seemed to have sensed the changes. The city gates closed, and the Grand Arrays activated. A hazy yellow light enveloped Wei Du's Imperial City. Over at Tianmen City, a pitch-black curtain of light enveloped the entire city, looking like a giant black bubble from afar.

The Fourth Prince was chasing Mo Qingchan. Neither of them flew towards Wei Du or Tianmen City. Mo Qingchan didn't want to go back; she intended to use this upheaval to break free from the massive web woven for her by Mo Changzong and the Fourth Prince. As for the Fourth Prince, he didn't dare to go back. He knew his father was doomed. If his father died, could Wei Du still hold out? If the Wei family was to be annihilated this time, wouldn't returning be sending himself to his death? Moreover, even if he wanted to go back now, he couldn't. Once the Grand Array activated, it wouldn't easily allow others to enter.

He absolutely had to get Mo Qingchan! If the Wei family were annihilated, he would lose all resource support, and Mo Qingchan's high-grade Water Spirit Root was crucially important to him.

Lu Xu pursued the Fourth Prince for a while, vaguely hearing sounds of fighting from ahead. He slowed down, gradually approached, and then hid himself, applying a Qi Concealment Talisman. From afar, in the clearing within the forest, there were three figures. One of them was Mo Qingchan, in a black dress. The other two were the Fourth Prince and his attendant. All three were at the seventh level of Qi Condensation.

Lu Xu watched from a distance, secretly delighted: "As expected, they're fighting!" He wasn't in a hurry to reveal himself, but quietly hid, waiting for them to exhaust each other. On the clearing, the lights of magic artifacts and talismans continuously flickered, interspersed with booms and the Fourth Prince's pleading voice:

"Qingchan, I would never hurt you. Just come with me. After I reach Foundation Establishment, I will definitely kill the leader of the Black Robe Society to avenge your Mo family!"

"Wei Yuantu, you should worry about yourself first. Now that your Wei family can barely protect itself, do you still think you have a hope of reaching Foundation Establishment?" Mo Qingchan's cold voice rang out.

"Even if the Wei family falls, it doesn't mean I've lost my hope of reaching Foundation Establishment. Besides, it's still uncertain whether Qianjue Sect can truly annihilate our Wei family!"

"Hmph, enough nonsense. Now the situation has flipped. If you want to control me, let's see what you've got!"

"Since you're so stubborn, don't blame me for being impolite!"

"Boom!" A huge explosion resounded, and the battle intensified. Mo Qingchan fought one against two, and though she was at a disadvantage, the Fourth Prince and his attendant couldn't defeat her quickly. This was because Mo Qingchan, as the former eldest daughter of the Mo family, still possessed many trump cards. While the Fourth Prince also had very powerful trump cards, he had basically exhausted them when facing the attack from the Black Robe Society leader. He had even used his most precious Tier-2 Heavenly Thunder Talisman. Now, facing Mo Qingchan, he naturally lacked sufficient power!
