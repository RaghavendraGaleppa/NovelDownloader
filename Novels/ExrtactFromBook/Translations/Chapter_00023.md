# Chapter 23: Advancement  

Noticing Xiao Liu's nervousness, Han Yue smiled reassuringly and said,  

"Xiao Liu, do you trust your Brother Dao?"  

"Of course I trust Brother Dao!" Xiao Liu replied.  

"If you trust me, then rest assured—you will definitely advance using second-tier demon beast meat!"  

"Thank you, Brother Dao! I believe in you!"  

Xiao Liu agreed readily, though his expression remained tense.  

The group returned to their residence and retreated to their respective rooms.  

Han Yue retrieved the second-tier demon beast meat he had obtained from the [Silver Hairpin] and began absorbing its primal energy.  

With the [Heavenly Yuan Treasure Lotus], Han Yue had no shortage of primal energy, so he only took four small pieces of the meat—merely to test its effects.  

His tests revealed that the energy density of second-tier demon beast meat was over ten times that of first-tier meat, rich with potent second-tier bloodline energy.  

Digesting second-tier flesh proved more challenging, making Xiao Liu's advancement far from guaranteed.  

As Han Yue silently absorbed the second-tier flesh, his mind wandered back to the Sword Hall Master he had seen earlier.  

On their way back, he had gathered information about the Sword Hall from his companions.  

The Sword Hall was actually an abbreviation for Courtyard No. 97 in the Yellow Zone.  

The Sword Hall had been passed down through four generations in the Meat Division, with each hall master being a second-tier sword cultivator.  

Moreover, the hall rarely housed more than three members—most of the time, it consisted solely of the hall master.  

Because every hall master possessed extraordinary strength and completed hunting missions with just one or two members, the Sword Hall's reputation was widely recognized throughout the Meat Division, earning it its abbreviated name.  

The Merchant Hall and the Sword Hall were the only two halls in the Meat Division with such distinctions.  

The Sword Hall Master's prowess had been on full display during the meat distribution earlier.  

The sharp, dazzling sword light had left a deep impression on Han Yue.  

Inwardly, he constantly weighed his own strength against that of the Sword Hall Master.  

In terms of movement speed, his [Golden Light Earth-Treading Art] undoubtedly held the advantage.  

Even if the Sword Hall Master could transform into a streak of sword light, Han Yue was still faster.  

When it came to offense, both were equally formidable. Han Yue believed that if he unleashed his full power with the [Thoughtless Slash], the Sword Hall Master might not be able to block it.  

However, Han Yue was absolutely certain that he could not withstand the Sword Hall Master's attacks.  

If the latter deployed that sword-light net technique—the one that had shredded the black bear—to defend himself, Han Yue would be injured even if he closed the distance with [Golden Light Earth-Treading Art].  

In Han Yue's estimation, if he were to face the Sword Hall Master head-on in a direct confrontation...  

...his best chance would be to strike before the sword net could be formed. Once the net was in place, his only option would be to flee.  

Thus, Han Yue concluded that he was still more of an ambush assassin than a straightforward, indomitable swordsman like the Sword Hall Master.  

Compared to orthodox cultivators with proper lineages, Han Yue's combat system had glaring weaknesses.  

Though his divine abilities were powerful, his methods were limited. He lacked versatility and strategic adaptability, making his fighting style rigid.  

This only strengthened Han Yue's resolve to pursue the path of immortality. His shortcomings merely fueled his determination.  

Quietly settling his mind, Han Yue continued refining his runic magic power, preparing for the next hunt.  

Meanwhile, Xiao Liu began his first attempt at absorbing energy.  

Coming from a family with some cultivation background, Xiao Liu was well-prepared for the process.  

He had mentally rehearsed countless solutions for potential issues during energy absorption.  

He took out a piece of second-tier tiger meat and placed it in his mouth.  

The metallic tang of blood surged straight to his skull.  

A faint trace of bloodline magic power began emanating from the meat in his mouth.  

Xiao Liu guided this energy through a fixed circulation path in his body.  

However, since this energy wasn’t his own, it continuously leaked out as it flowed.  

The key to success lay in retaining a portion of the demonic energy within his body, allowing it to take root and flourish.  

Yet, his first attempt ended in failure.  

Every last trace of the tiger meat’s energy escaped his body, leaving behind only pain and minor physical enhancement.  

Unfazed, Xiao Liu took a moment to rest and recover—he still had three more attempts.  

He had prepared ample food and water in his [Treasure Pouch], ensuring he was fully equipped for the task.  

Elsewhere, Han Yue had already taken to the skies on his golden light, heading deeper into the outer regions.  

Today, he had a mission.  

His [Golden Light Earth-Treading Art] was on the verge of a breakthrough in proficiency!  

With his magic power fully charged, all he needed was to cover a certain distance in flight to trigger an advancement in his strength.  

Han Yue wasn’t planning to hunt today. Instead, he soared freely through the sky.  

Moments like these always filled him with exhilaration and pride.  

Today, he had no other goal but to revel in the joy of flight.  

As his golden light traversed thousands of miles of mountains and rivers, Han Yue’s heart expanded with the vastness around him.  

He deliberately aimed higher, each leap ending at a greater altitude.  

Activating his [Thread Armor] to its fullest, he braced against the fierce gales.  

The howling winds lashed at him like countless blades!  

His armor shimmered with a faint white glow, clinking sharply as it resisted the gale’s onslaught.  

As he ascended, the clouds thinned, the air grew sparse, and the winds only intensified.  

When he finally breached the ten-thousand-meter mark, he emerged above the clouds.  

Here, the sky stretched endlessly above, while a sea of clouds rolled below—a boundless expanse of freedom.  

Yet Han Yue knew this place was perilous.  

The gales here carried traces of azure primal energy, making them far more dangerous.  

And it was amidst these relentless winds that his [Golden Light Earth-Treading Art] finally advanced!  

**[Divine Ability: Jade Void · Golden Light Earth-Treading Art]**  
**[Quality: Mythic · Gold]**  
**[Proficiency: Mastery (1%)]**  
**[Keyword: Movement]**  

A radiant golden light erupted from the rune in his consciousness, illuminating the heavens!  

Han Yue felt complete mastery over the technique, its power surging to new heights.  

But before he could test its improvements, a piercing eagle’s cry tore through the sky!  

The sound seemed to pierce his eardrums, carrying an overwhelming sense of power and majesty.  

Without hesitation, Han Yue transformed into a streak of light and dove toward the ground, fleeing at low altitude.  

A moment later, a dark shadow streaked across the sky—a massive black eagle appeared where Han Yue had just been!  

The eagle scanned its surroundings with keen, intelligent eyes, as if searching for something.
