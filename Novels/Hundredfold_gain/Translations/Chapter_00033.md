# Chapter 33: Encountering Qi Chan'er Again

Qi Chuan stood at the entrance of the Mission Hall, glancing up at the large plaque bearing the words "Mission Hall" before stepping inside.

The interior was unexpectedly spacious and bright, with floors polished like mirrors and eye-catching displays lining the walls—a stark contrast to the modest Mission Pavilion of the Qi family. Three massive jade screens dominated the walls, displaying numerous mission details.

Many inner sect disciples were gathered in the hall, studying the missions on the screens with intense focus.

"Most of these disciples seem to be at the mid to late stages of Qi Refinement, with quite a few even at the late stage," Qi Chuan mused as he briefly assessed their cultivation levels. Though his perception wasn't precise, he could roughly gauge their strength.

Many were senior inner sect disciples, with cultivation levels around the fifth or sixth layer of Qi Refinement. Some, likely veteran disciples in their thirties or forties, had even reached the late stages of Qi Refinement.

After a quick survey, Qi Chuan turned his attention to the jade screens.

"True Disciple Liu Ying, currently studying alchemy, requires two female inner sect disciples proficient in fire-attribute techniques. Must be at least at the sixth layer of Qi Refinement with Minor Achievement in the Fireball Technique. Duration: approximately one month. Reward: 5 sect contribution points."

"Slay a late-stage Black Spirit Blood Ape in Blackwind Valley, 500 li away, and retrieve the essence blood from its heart. Reward: 8 sect contribution points."

"..."

"Most of these missions aren't great..." Qi Chuan shook his head slightly.

Whether it was the Qi family's internal missions or these sect missions, they shared a common flaw—long durations and meager rewards. Assisting True Disciple Liu Ying as a fire provider for a month yielded five sect contribution points, equivalent to fifty low-grade spirit stones—a decent payout. Qi Chuan's Fireball Technique had reached Major Achievement, exceeding the requirement, but his cultivation level was insufficient, and the mission specified female disciples.

As for the Black Spirit Blood Ape mission, Blackwind Valley was a notorious danger zone. Provoking a late-stage Qi Refinement beast wasn't worth the risk.

"Is there no mission that's quick, safe, and offers decent rewards?" Qi Chuan scanned the screens but found nothing suitable. Recalling his experience with Qi family missions, he decided to wait for better options.

Half an hour passed. Several other inner sect disciples shared his patience, lingering in hopes of new postings. During this time, some missions refreshed, but none caught Qi Chuan's eye.

Then, a new mission appeared: "Slay Watermist Crocodiles in the Cloudrise Mountains. Reward: 3 sect contribution points per pair of fangs."

"This one seems decent," Qi Chuan murmured after some thought. He decided to accept it.

The Cloudrise Mountains were close to Moonlit Lake, a long, fog-shrouded range teeming with demonic beasts. Connected to the outer mountains of Moonlit Lake, they were considered part of the sect's "inner territory," offering relative safety.

Watermist Crocodiles were mid-tier first-grade demonic beasts, roughly equivalent to human cultivators at the fourth layer of Qi Refinement. Though they lived in groups, their water-aligned nature made them vulnerable to fire—a weakness Qi Chuan could exploit with his Major Achievement Fireball Technique. With caution, the mission should be manageable.

The reward—three sect contribution points per pair of fangs—equated to thirty low-grade spirit stones. A few kills would fund his cultivation resources for months.

Activating his inner sect token, Qi Chuan channeled spiritual energy into the jade screen, claiming the mission. After registering at the counter, he set off for the Cloudrise Mountains.

The journey was brief. Soon, Qi Chuan stood before the mist-veiled mountains, their gloomy aura belying their relative safety. He ventured in, navigating the dense forest with care. The air echoed with distant cries and the occasional rustle of unseen creatures.

Eventually, he reached a vast black swamp, its putrid mud writhing with worms and bubbling with noxious gases. This was the Watermist Crocodiles' domain.

"Where are they?" Qi Chuan frowned, seeing no sign of the beasts. Casting the Levitation Technique, he hovered above the swamp, scanning the murky waters.

A short distance in, he spotted what appeared to be a floating log—a crocodile's snout barely breaking the surface.

"Found one." Smiling, Qi Chuan formed a hand seal and unleashed a blazing fireball. The crimson sphere, wreathed in dark flames, streaked toward the "log" with terrifying speed.

The crocodile barely had time to react before the fireball struck. A shrill screech pierced the air as the swamp erupted in a geyser of mud and flame. When the smoke cleared, a charred, scaly corpse floated atop the water.

Qi Chuan retrieved the fangs with practiced ease, letting the carcass sink back into the mire. The fangs were the only valuable parts; without a storage pouch, he couldn't carry the rest.

"Three sect contribution points down," he muttered. "Thirty spirit stones—enough for three months of cultivation pills." He pressed deeper into the swamp.

Over the next few hours, he dispatched two more crocodiles, amassing six contribution points in total. Yet, the creatures were scarce. "Strange. Weren't they supposed to be social beasts?"

Resting on a small island, Qi Chuan absorbed spirit stones to replenish his energy. "One last sweep, then I'll head back."

As he prepared to leave, distant sounds of battle reached his ears—crocodile roars and a young girl's pained gasp.

"Someone's fighting a group of them?" Qi Chuan's brow furrowed. "No wonder I found so few. Did this person attract them all?" The voice sounded oddly familiar...

Curious, he flew toward the commotion.

On a rocky islet, a crimson-clad girl was besieged by four Watermist Crocodiles, her lips stained with blood as she struggled to hold her ground.

"It really is her..." Qi Chuan sighed.

The girl was none other than Qi Chan'er, whom he'd parted ways with months ago when she joined the sect's outer division. He hadn't expected to encounter her here—let alone in such dire straits.

"How did she end up surrounded by four of them?" he wondered, shaking his head. "Careless."
