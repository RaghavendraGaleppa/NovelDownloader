# Chapter 17: A Seller's Market

"You must be joking. If you had connections to purchase brand new magic artifacts from craftsmen, our shop would be willing to buy them at market price," the manager of another artifact shop in the rogue cultivator market sneered.

Chen Daoxuan wasn't angered by these words. Instead, he smiled and said, "Farewell!"

"Hmph!"

The shop manager watched Chen Daoxuan leave with a dark expression. If this weren't Guang'an Prefecture, he might have taught this mere third-level Qi Refining cultivator a lesson for such disrespect.

After spending the entire morning visiting nearly every artifact shop in the rogue cultivator market, Chen Daoxuan reached one conclusion: the magic artifact market in Guang'an Prefecture was severely undersupplied.

Not only were brand new artifacts scarce, but even second-hand items of decent quality were quickly snapped up by rogue cultivators—and at full price, no less.

Generally, first-tier magic artifacts ranged from dozens to several hundred spirit stones. Even the highest-quality top-grade first-tier artifacts rarely exceeded one thousand spirit stones.

Based on his morning's investigation, opening an artifact shop in the rogue cultivator market seemed highly promising. Unlike the core commercial district, where shops were difficult to purchase or rent, the rogue cultivator market had no such issues. Along the way, he even noticed several vacant shops available for rent or sale.

The reason was simple: the street vendors were stealing business from established shops. Unless a shop offered truly valuable goods—which most didn't, given their stock of second-hand and subpar items—rogue cultivators preferred to take their chances with street stalls, where prices were lower. With luck, they might even stumble upon hidden treasures from uninformed sellers.

By the time Chen Daoxuan finished surveying the artifact shops, it was already noon. With several hours left before his scheduled meeting with Chen Xianhe, he decided to explore the largest street market in the rogue cultivator district.

Entering the market felt like stepping into a flea market from his past life. If not for the talismans, formation disks, and spirit ores on display, he might have thought he'd returned to Earth.

Shaking off the nostalgic thought, Chen Daoxuan approached a stall run by a burly, bearded man who appeared honest and straightforward.

"Friend," Chen Daoxuan greeted with a cupped-hand salute. "May I ask the price of this formation disk?"

The stall owner, roused from his meditation mat, eagerly stood up and rubbed his hands together. "You've got a keen eye, friend! This is the Wind-Thunder Formation Disk. It contains a small Wind-Thunder Array that, when activated, can deploy a ten-zhang radius formation capable of trapping, attacking, and even offering some defensive capabilities. Truly a versatile artifact!"

He pointed to the cracked octagonal disk on the stall. "Only one hundred spirit stones!"

The bearded man held up a finger, grinning.

Chen Daoxuan remained expressionless. "May I test it?"

"Go right ahead!" The stall owner waved magnanimously.

Nodding, Chen Daoxuan picked up the disk and channeled a stream of true energy into it. To his surprise, the supposedly miraculous Wind-Thunder Formation Disk flickered briefly before abruptly extinguishing—then shattered along its cracks, crumbling into fragments that scattered across the ground.

Chen Daoxuan: "..."

Bearded Stall Owner: "..."

An awkward silence fell.

Chen Daoxuan had been interested in the disk precisely because his family's artifact-crafting heritage lacked records of formation-type artifacts. Yet here he was, a trained craftsman, duped by what was clearly a nearly worthless artifact on the verge of collapse. This "honest-looking" vendor was nothing more than a scammer.

Sure enough, the bearded man immediately raised his voice in righteous indignation. "What's the meaning of this, friend? Why would you destroy my artifact worth a hundred spirit stones for no reason? Who would have thought someone as young and dignified as you would pull such a stunt!"

His loud accusations quickly drew the attention of nearby pedestrians and vendors, who gathered to watch the spectacle.

"That damned Zhang San is at it again, swindling people!"

"This young fellow looks unfamiliar. This should be entertaining."

A few higher-level Qi Refining cultivators even jeered, "Zhang San, a hundred spirit stones? That disk's worth at least a thousand!"

Zhang San, the bearded stall owner, glared at the heckler—an older stall owner named Wei Laogui, a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator—and immediately deflated. Realizing he was outmatched, he softened his tone and waved dismissively.

"Ah, forget it. You're young, probably new to the path of cultivation. I won't make things difficult for you." He put on a magnanimous air. "Besides, I did let you test the disk, so I bear some responsibility too. How about this—just compensate me fifty spirit stones, and we'll call it even. Fair, no?"

He grinned as if offering a great deal.

Chen Daoxuan nearly laughed at the man's shamelessness. "Not fair at all."

"Hey, kid, don't push your luck!" Zhang San rolled up his sleeves threateningly. "Don't think I can't teach you a lesson just because we're in Guang'an Prefecture!"

Yet Chen Daoxuan simply stared at him calmly, unmoved. Zhang San, realizing he couldn't actually act on his threat—doing so would mean provoking the Zhou family, rulers of Guang'an—found himself stuck. The growing crowd's jeers only made his predicament worse.

As the standoff continued, Zhou family law enforcement officers soon arrived.

"Make way! Make way!"

"Step aside! The enforcers are here!"

The crowd parted as two Zhou family enforcers in cyan robes emblazoned with fire spirit pearls pushed through.

"What's going on here?" one demanded.

Zhang San's expression shifted instantly. He bowed hastily. "Nothing, nothing! Just a friendly discussion with this young brother!"

"Is that true?" The enforcer turned to Chen Daoxuan.

Glancing at Zhang San's pleading look, Chen Daoxuan nodded. "Just a minor disagreement over pricing. Nothing serious."

Seeing no further conflict, the enforcers let it go—though the older one warned Zhang San, "Don't cause trouble here, or you won't get off as lightly as last time."

"Understood, understood!" Zhang San bowed repeatedly as they left.

With the show over, the crowd dispersed, and the market's usual bustle resumed.

"Brother, thank you for earlier," Zhang San said earnestly, cupping his hands.

"Don't thank me yet," Chen Daoxuan replied. "First, tell me—where did you get this Wind-Thunder Formation Disk?"

He pointed at the shattered fragments on the ground.
