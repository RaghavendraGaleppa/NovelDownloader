# Chapter 204: Primordial Immortal Core, Void Furnace

“Primordial Immortal Core, Void Furnace?”

Inside the cultivation chamber.

The time power that had previously permeated everywhere, dense to the extreme, had now completely vanished.

At a certain moment, Zhang Jing suddenly opened his eyes, and a vast aura erupted from his body. It then seemed to be empowered by some force, rapidly surging upwards.

In just an instant, his aura soared nine times in a row!

Boom!

At this moment, his aura, dozens of times more terrifying than before, solidified into a tangible presence, emitting an extremely oppressive and heavy atmosphere.

Creak—

Cracks began to appear on the ground, accompanied by groans of unbearable strain.

At this moment, if there were anyone else in the cultivation chamber, they would surely notice the layers upon layers of vast, flickering Nine Heavens Worlds rising behind Zhang Jing, resembling nine magnificent, sky-piercing rings of immortal light, enveloping him. He shone like a magnificent immortal deity, noble and indescribable.

And at the very center of each of these Nine Heavens Worlds, there was a core, like the eye of the sea, continuously drawing in and devouring endless myriad spirits and primordial energies, refining them into threads of the purest primordial qi, silently expanding the corresponding layer of the Heaven World.

At the same time, in the deepest part, an immense furnace, invisible and intangible yet truly existing, connected to the void on one side, while quietly spewing rich and pure immortal energy on the other, transforming it into streams of immortal spiritual qi. The speed seemed somewhat slow, but it was ceaseless, giving Zhang Jing a terrifying feeling that it would continue until the end of the world.

The nine void furnaces of the Nine Heavens were fully activated. Massive amounts of immortal energy continuously fused into Zhang Jing's body every moment, incrementally strengthening his already exceedingly formidable physique. Even his cultivation, which had already reached its limit and could advance no further, subtly climbed a little higher towards an unknown realm.

…

“Can I truly… still be considered a Foundation Establishment cultivator?”

Carefully sensing the changes within his body, the nearly infinite magical power, and the terrifying, ever-present strengthening power from the Nine Heavens World projection, a hint of bewilderment suddenly appeared in Zhang Jing's eyes. Excluding the pseudo-Innate Primal Immortal Light and the Grand Dao Will, he felt that a casual slap now could easily kill his previous self; the two were simply not on the same level at all. It was a colossal difference in sheer power. And his two ultimate killing moves, the pseudo-Innate Primal Immortal Light and the Grand Dao Will, the power they could unleash in Zhang Jing's current hands was also incomparable to before.

It could even be said to be a world of difference.

He was tempted to try it out, but then he remembered that this was, after all, his master's grotto-heaven cultivation ground, so Zhang Jing could only give up the idea.

Whoosh—

He couldn't help but let out a long breath. For a moment, he felt incredibly refreshed and joyful. The power of the Twenty-Four Heavens divine ability, now at Level 6, far exceeded his expectations. These hundreds of millions of qi fortune were well spent.

Wait!

Zhang Jing's mind suddenly 'looked' within his Niwan Palace. The greatest contributor this time was still his old friend, the jade talisman. Leaving aside its rapid upgrading for a moment, the key was the two skill characteristics it had bestowed upon the Twenty-Four Heavens ability, which directly made this divine ability transcend its original scope. It was no exaggeration to say it was a new, more powerful divine ability.

“So, after becoming a True Disciple, will I need to go out and establish a cultivation ground?” Zhang Jing suddenly thought.

…

And at this moment, outside the main gate, a wisp of terrifying aura quietly spread out from within the palace, reaching directly to Deer Thirty-Eight's feet. He instinctively shivered. Then he turned his head to look in Zhang Jing's direction, a hint of joy flashing in his eyes.

“What a powerful aura, has master broken through?”

Just as Deer Thirty-Eight was pondering, the palace gate slowly opened.

Thump, thump—

Accompanying the light footsteps, a figure with a magnificent aura slowly walked out.

“You've worked hard, Thirty-Eight.” Zhang Jing looked at Deer Thirty-Eight and said warmly, as if he had known all along that the other party was guarding the palace entrance.

“Hehe, Master, please don't praise me, this is what I should do.” Deer Thirty-Eight repeatedly waved his hand, a hint of shyness appearing on his face.

But the next moment, as if realizing something, his gaze towards his master suddenly became blank. “Master, your cultivation… why is it still at the Foundation Establishment Realm?” His voice was full of disbelief. So Master's cultivation hasn't broken through? Then where did that aura that almost suffocated him just now come from?

Just then, Zhang Jing subtly sensed something and said with a smile, “Thirty-Eight, some senior brothers from outside the island have come to visit; come with me to greet them.”

“Yes, Master!” Deer Thirty-Eight respectfully replied.

…

Outside the immortal island, three figures stood quietly, none other than Xuan Yuan, who had visited last time, along with Senior Brothers Qing and Gu.

At this moment, the expressions on their faces varied.

“Senior Brother, are you saying Junior Brother Zhang Jing achieved first place in the Foundation Establishment Realm during the recently opened Proud Cloud Secret Realm?” Qing He, clad in a white robe, repeatedly confirmed. He only felt his thoughts becoming sluggish. It had only been a mere thirty to forty years since he last saw Junior Brother Zhang Jing, who had just entered the grotto-heaven. In the interim, he had merely been in seclusion for a while. How did the other party manage to go into the Proud Cloud Secret Realm and seize first place in one fell swoop?

“Hehe, Junior Brother Qing, Junior Brother Zhang Jing is probably about to enter the Golden Core Realm. If your cultivation doesn't break through soon, you might be caught up to.” Gu Yao, standing by, said with a chuckle. “Tsk, that would be interesting.”

“There's more.” Xuan Yuan, standing at the very front, added in a rather shocked tone: “You two might not know, but Junior Brother Zhang Jing cultivates the Path of Derivative Worlds, a legacy from the Grand Beginning Primal World. You should be somewhat aware of the cultivation requirements for this path.”

“Derivative Worlds? Someone actually chose that abnormal path?” Gu Yao, who had just been full of teasing, immediately exclaimed in surprise.

Meeting the bewildered gazes of his two junior brothers, Xuan Yuan nodded affirmingly. “Legend has it that cultivators on the Path of Derivative Worlds need to master the most basic yet most difficult thirty-six kinds of Dao Wills during the Foundation Establishment Realm. Junior Brother Zhang Jing… in just over thirty years?”

Qing He clicked his tongue. The three suddenly exchanged glances, and a thought simultaneously emerged in their minds. “This guy, he couldn't actually succeed in cultivating the Derivative Worlds, could he?!”

Just as they were speaking, a gentle voice suddenly rang out. “Haha, three Senior Brothers, what an honor to have you grace us with your presence. This Junior Brother failed to greet you from afar, I hope you don't mind.”

Xuan Yuan and the two immediately looked in the direction of the voice, and upon seeing the arrival, bright smiles instantly appeared on their faces.

“Junior Brother Zhang Jing is too polite.”

“It should be us Senior Brothers who came uninvited.”

“Haha, we heard that Junior Brother achieved first place in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm and specially came to congratulate you.”
