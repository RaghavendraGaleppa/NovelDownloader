**Chapter 58: Liu Yun Arrives**

"What is it? Senior Brother, tell me!" Ding Rui said. At this moment, he couldn't help but take Water Fish's words seriously, as the other party was indeed a true genius cultivator with real talent.
Although he liked to boast, Water Fish, despite being a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator, had created a directly usable Fire Float Formation, which was enough to prove his talent in formations.
Throughout the entire Sect Domain, perhaps few cultivators could achieve such a feat.
Formations were the most important things in the Sect Domain, and also one of the foundations of cultivation.
Before reaching the Sea Condensation Realm, cultivators found it difficult to even comprehend what formations were, let alone create them.
And for Ding Rui now, formations were entirely a mysterious and distant realm.
"I have a big new idea here, and I'm about to start working on it, but I'm truly short on manpower. The reason I sought you out in the Miscellaneous Hall is to invite you to join me in bringing this idea to fruition!" Water Fish's tone was very excited when he spoke, full of drive and anticipation.
Ding Rui's curiosity was immediately piqued: "Senior Brother, what kind of idea?"
Water Fish glanced at him, smiling, and asked, "Want to know?"
"Yes, yes!" Ding Rui nodded immediately.
"Then quickly become an Outer Disciple, and then come find me in the Miscellaneous Hall!"

He had to use the remaining time today to loosen all the soil in the entire spiritual field.
Tomorrow, the sect would bring the spiritual rice seeds, and then he would officially begin his life as a spiritual farmer.
The distance from spiritual field 377 to spiritual field 520 was truly not short, and coupled with the slow speed of the float-boat, it was already almost evening.
Ding Rui looked up at the sky, shaking his head with a trace of helplessness: "I might have to work late for a while. It's also a good chance to see the effect of the Earth Qi Hoe. Once the seeds are planted tomorrow, I'll be much more relaxed."
"Although loosening the soil relies solely on the Earth Qi Hoe, both [Insect-Killing Herb] and [Iceflame Palm] are skills that act simultaneously. I shouldn't be as busy as Brother Liu was in the spiritual field."
As Ding Rui spoke, he recalled Liu Yun's miserable state he had seen earlier, and involuntarily shivered, quickly taking out the Earth Qi Hoe to begin loosening the soil.
He even released [Iceflame Palm] to bring rain while loosening the soil.
Condensing sunlight would naturally be useless at this hour, but bringing rain could make the soil more moist, which in turn would make the soil loosening more efficient.
Although using [Iceflame Palm] would simultaneously trigger the True Essence from the Condensing Yang Art.
Ding Rui could, however, control the Condensing Yang Art's True Essence to remain quietly within his acupoints at this time.
And there would be no ill effects.
After all, the Skill Slots were entirely for Ding Rui's service; he could adjust any skills he had already condensed and placed in his skill slots at any time.
Using half and disabling the other half was merely a basic operation.

"Buzz..."
Just then, the formation of the spiritual field suddenly let out a faint hum.
A visitor had arrived.
Ding Rui frowned. It was already dark; who would come to see him now?
Thinking this, he opened the door. The person standing outside made Ding Rui surprised: "Brother Liu, why are you here?"
The visitor was none other than Liu Yun, who had been overworked to the point of being unrecognizable a while ago.
Liu Yun still looked very tired, dark circles almost covering half his face.
"What? Can't I come anymore?" Liu Yun gave Ding Rui a glare, then stepped directly inside.
Ding Rui followed him in, looking bewildered.
