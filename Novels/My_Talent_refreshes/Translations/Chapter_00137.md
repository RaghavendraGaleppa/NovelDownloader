# Chapter 137: Spells, Pills, and Milking the System Before Leaving

Without taking any pills or relying on any other methods, Chu Ning simply absorbed the spiritual Qi from heaven and earth through his breathing and Qi absorption technique.

At this moment, if someone were to carefully sense it, they would discover that the spiritual Qi Chu Ning was absorbing through his breathing was pure fire-attribute spiritual Qi. After these spiritual energies entered Chu Ning’s body, they settled into his Dantian and then into his Dharma Power Circle. This process was extremely similar to when Chu Ning first cultivated the Azurewood Everlasting Spring Art, but the speed was incomparable.

Half a day later, Chu Ning opened his eyes and nodded with satisfaction.

“Although I haven't relied on any pills or spiritual fruits, the spiritual Qi in this cave abode is abundant, so cultivating this Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art is quite fast. It’s a pity I can’t stay here for too long, otherwise, at this rate, in about a month, I could not only completely convert all my Dharma power but also fully consolidate my cultivation at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation.”

Although he thought this, Chu Ning had no intention of changing his mind. There would be plenty of time for cultivation later, but staying in this sect without an opportunity to leave meant facing too many unknown risks.

Chu Ning then checked his proficiency in his mind, and sure enough, there were changes.

[Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art (Profound-tier High-grade), First Layer (0/5000)]
[Nine Derivations Body Tempering Art, Volume One, Tendon Fortification 868/1500]
[Spirit Refining Art, Second Layer 83/2000]

The proficiency for the first layer of Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art had directly jumped to 5000, which slightly surprised Chu Ning. However, on second thought, the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art was a Profound-tier High-grade cultivation art after all. Moreover, if cultivated to the maximum first layer, it would probably be close to the Foundation Establishment stage, so it wasn't overly exaggerated. As for the fact that he hadn't gained even 1 point of proficiency in this half-day of cultivation, Chu Ning wasn't too disheartened. He had only just begun, and he was purely meditating without the aid of any external objects.

For the next few days, Chu Ning remained in the cave abode, dedicating himself to cultivating the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art. After five days of such cultivation, Chu Ning once again emerged from the abode.

"The proficiency of Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art has increased by 5 points, roughly 1 point per day. This indicates that I am indeed suited to cultivating this art."

Since this was confirmed, there was no need to wait any longer.

Holding three jade slips of cultivation arts, Chu Ning once again headed towards the Scripture Depository. Deacon Zhao, who was in charge of the Scripture Depository, was quite surprised to see Chu Ning had chosen the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art. However, the sect had previously given an order that Chu Ning could exchange for a higher-tier cultivation art, and he hadn't received any instructions prohibiting Chu Ning from cultivating this art. So, he didn't make things difficult for Chu Ning. After retrieving the two previous jade slips, he promptly removed the restriction on the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art jade slip in Chu Ning's hand.

Seizing this opportunity, Chu Ning spoke, “Martial Uncle Zhao, I’ve decided to switch to cultivating the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art, but previously I only cultivated wood-attribute spells. I wonder if I can choose to learn a few fire-attribute spells?”

This was another purpose for Chu Ning’s visit to the Scripture Depository. One of the talents of his Midday Fire Spiritual Body was that using fire-attribute spells could double his attack power. With such a great divine ability, Chu Ning naturally wanted to utilize it. However, he had no fire-attribute spells besides a basic Fireball Spell. Later, he could try condensing a talisman seed for the Blazing Flame Talisman, but honestly, the power of the Blazing Flame Talisman wasn't top-tier. If he could obtain one or two powerful fire-element attack spells from the sect, it would undoubtedly be excellent.

Deacon Zhao didn't seem too surprised by Chu Ning's words. "Go to the fire-attribute spell room on the second floor and pick one yourself. Don't be too greedy; just choose one spell." He performed a few incantations on Chu Ning's jade talisman, then paused and added, "Act according to your ability. When you reach the intermediate and advanced spell tiers, the difficulty of each tier might double. You are only at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation now; you might not be able to use overly advanced spells."

"Yes, thank you, Martial Uncle Zhao."

Chu Ning took the jade talisman from Deacon Zhao and quickly ascended to the second floor. Unlike the large room on the third floor with various shelves, the second floor consisted of individual rooms. Chu Ning found the room labeled "Fire Attribute Spells" and used the jade talisman to open the room's restriction. Upon entering, he found that it didn't contain low-tier spells; most were intermediate spells, and besides those, there were only a few advanced spells.

"Are there no peak-tier spells in the sect, or are they not readily available for us to learn?" Chu Ning’s thought flickered, and then he walked directly towards the advanced spells.

Since he was going to learn a spell, it was only natural to choose a higher-grade one. As for the difficulty of learning high-grade spells, for someone with a Midday Fire Spiritual Body, this was no issue. Chu Ning had deeply experienced this when he possessed the Tigerwood Spiritual Body and spells; back then, in the mid-Qi Condensation stage, he had learned the early-stage high-grade Azurewood Sword Art with ease.

After circling around, he found that there weren't many high-tier mid-grade spells available in the room, only a few like the Blood Flame Blade. And there was only one high-tier high-grade spell, named the Blazing Fire Flame Art. The introduction of this Blazing Fire Flame Art immediately captured Chu Ning's attention.

This spell could be used to attack by transforming into different grades of demonic beasts, and its attack power was much stronger than ordinary fire-attribute spells. If it could be cultivated to the highest level, and one understood the attack methods of high-grade demonic beasts, transforming into such a demonic beast could even rival peak-tier spells. The introduction also mentioned that this spell was not created by the Green Stream Sect but was obtained by chance by a senior of the Green Stream Sect. However, due to its extreme difficulty, even Foundation Establishment or Golden Core cultivators needed to invest a significant amount of time to cultivate it. If one didn't have an exceptional talent for fire-element spells, it was impossible to even get started with this spell. It was even speculated that only those with a Fire Attribute Heavenly Spiritual Root could cultivate it effectively. After being in the sect for some time without attracting any attention, the sect placed it among the high-tier high-grade spells.

Chu Ning’s eyes flashed slightly upon reading this. High cultivation difficulty? High talent requirement? Wasn't this spell tailor-made for him? Moreover, judging by the introduction, the spell's potential seemed to be far beyond what was described.

He chose it!

Chu Ning hesitated almost not at all, directly using the jade talisman to unlock the restriction and take down the jade slip. The jade talisman Deacon Zhao had given him only allowed him to unlock one restriction, so Chu Ning naturally couldn't take anything else at this time. However, he genuinely had no other intentions, so he turned and went downstairs.

"Blazing Fire Flame Art?" Seeing the jade slip Chu Ning had obtained, Deacon Zhao showed a peculiar expression. Then he shook his head, took out another jade slip, and registered it. Chu Ning saw the other party's expression and knew what he meant, but naturally didn't take it to heart. However, he still asked another question he was concerned about.

“There are no restrictions applied within this spell jade slip; you can see all its content. Nephew, cultivate well.” Hearing Deacon Zhao’s unmistakably playful tone, Chu Ning pretended not to notice, beaming as he took the jade slip and left the Scripture Depository.

Watching Chu Ning depart, Deacon Zhao chuckled softly and mumbled, “A month at most, no, half a month, he’ll definitely bring it back to exchange it.”

Chu Ning, having walked far away, naturally didn’t hear these words. After placing the jade slip into his storage pouch, he turned and headed straight for the Thousand Mechanisms Pavilion. Since he had decided to leave, he might as well milk all the benefits he could from his current identity. It had been nearly two months since he last received the Wood Origin Pills, so getting some more pills wouldn't be excessive.

Arriving at the Thousand Mechanisms Pavilion, the one on duty was Ji Mengliang, whom Chu Ning had met before. He quickly walked forward and cupped his hands in salute.

“Martial Uncle Ji.”

“Oh, is Martial Nephew Chu here?” Ji Mengliang’s face still held that amiable expression. “Have the Wood Origin Pills you received last time almost run out? How many do you want this time?”

“Martial Uncle, I haven’t come for Wood Origin Pills this time,” Chu Ning shook his head and said. “I have now switched to a wood-fire dual-attribute cultivation art. This time, I specifically wanted to ask if there are any pills suitable for this type of cultivation art. If not, I’ll just get some Spirit Essence Pills.”

“Switched to a wood-fire dual-attribute cultivation art?” Ji Mengliang looked at Chu Ning with a hint of surprise. However, he didn't ask further, instead chuckling, “What a coincidence. Normally, we wouldn't have any, but the pavilion actually has a batch of high-quality pills of this kind right now.”

“Elder Gui, who is in charge of alchemy in the sect, had a beloved disciple who cultivated a wood-fire dual-attribute cultivation art. It seems something happened to him in the Spirit Realm. When the sect recently tidied his abode, they found some Azurewood Primordial Yang Pills and brought them all to the pavilion.” Ji Mengliang said, then turned around, patted casually behind him, and astonishingly retrieved five bottles of pills directly from a cabinet. “These items haven’t been cataloged into the pavilion yet; they just happened to be here.”

Saying this, Ji Mengliang handed the five bottles of pills directly to Chu Ning. At this moment, Chu Ning's heart stirred upon hearing these words. Could the person he was talking about be Shang Rui? Shang Rui, whom he had killed, was an Inner Disciple with a Fire-Wood Earth Spiritual Root. Chu Ning had been worried about any connections Shang Rui might have had with high-ranking sect members, so after returning to the sect, he hadn't dared to inquire about him.

Now, hearing Ji Mengliang’s words, a faint suspicion immediately arose in his mind. Of course, at this moment, he certainly wouldn't proactively ask.

“Azurewood Primordial Yang Pills?” Chu Ning simply murmured the name of the pill, then asked the other party, “How many pills are here?”

“One hundred and fifty pills!” Ji Mengliang said, then sternly added, “These Azurewood Primordial Yang Pills are second-tier low-grade pills. For Qi Condensation stage disciples, it’s not easy to refine them. With your current cultivation, Martial Nephew, these pills will last you a year without any issue.”

Hearing this, Chu Ning, who had originally wanted to ask for more pills, naturally found it inappropriate to say anything else. He thanked him and put away all the pills.

Back in his cave abode, Chu Ning summoned Little White Spirit. “Little White, we’re acting tonight. Your divine ability is fine, right?” he asked through divine sense transmission.

“Ying!” Little White Spirit chirped at Chu Ning, carrying a sense of pride that suggested if it could enter and exit the Spirit Realm, the sect’s grand formation was nothing.

Chu Ning nodded. With Little White Spirit’s assurance, he felt much more at ease. After all, Chu Ning had personally experienced Little White Spirit leading him in and out of the Spirit Realm last time, and he had witnessed the wonders of a minor world like the Spirit Realm. Compared to the restrictions of that Spirit Realm, the Green Stream Sect’s sect-protecting grand formation was indeed insignificant.

During this time, Chu Ning had gained a better understanding of the Spirit Realm by consulting various资料 in the Scripture Depository. According to the records, the appearance of Spirit Realms had no pattern; they varied in size but were all related to one thing: Spirit Seeds. Once a Spirit Seed in such a minor world was obtained or flew away, the minor world would collapse and disappear.

At the same time, Spirit Realms often had many restrictions. For example, the Spirit Realm Chu Ning and others had entered previously only allowed Qi Condensation cultivators to enter; cultivators of higher realms simply couldn't pass through the restrictions. And demonic beasts born within a minor world, even if they had the strength of second-tier demonic beasts, could not truly become second-tier demonic beasts. Another example: some Spirit Realms only allowed Foundation Establishment or Golden Core cultivators to enter, some did not allow flight, and some even prevented the use of Dharma power. They were bizarre and utterly without pattern.

Chu Ning also had a better understanding of Spirit Seeds. He knew that Spirit Seeds could not be refined; if obtained by cultivators and their spiritual energy and essence were absorbed, the Spirit Seed would then flee and lie dormant, then re-gather spiritual energy. It could take hundreds or even thousands of years for a Spirit Seed to reappear. Previously, whenever Spirit Seeds occasionally appeared, those who could comprehend their profound mysteries often became prominent figures in the cultivation world. It was said that several top powers on the Eastern Saint Continent had individuals who had comprehended the secrets of Spirit Seeds. Additionally, in other regions of this world, some great cultivators had also comprehended Spirit Seeds.

Seeing this information, Chu Ning could easily understand why Xin Wuya was so focused on this Spirit Seed. At the same time, he also predicted that the other party would certainly not give up so easily. Because if a Spirit Seed fled without its spiritual energy and essence being absorbed by another cultivator, it would not fall into dormancy.

Of course, none of this concerned Chu Ning anymore. His gaze swept over the medicine garden, and Chu Ning began to dig up the Iron Stem Orchids one by one. Chu Ning no longer had the seeds for these plants, and the Iron Stem Orchids he had planted before had all grown Golden Orchid Fruits. He didn't even have Iron Orchid Fruits in his hand; if he wanted to plant them, he would have to dig up the Iron Stem Orchids as well. Fortunately, these plants weren't tall, so taking them with him was convenient.

At the same time, Chu Ning also dug up all the spiritual plants he had brought from the Spirit Realm and planted there earlier, placing them into his storage pouch. As for some other spiritual plants he had planted recently, Chu Ning did not touch them; these were merely for show, to cover his tracks. He wanted to create the impression that he wasn't fleeing but had disappeared for other reasons. Therefore, he not only left these spiritual plants untouched but also slightly rearranged and moved them, so that the entire medicine garden would not look too abrupt after he had dug up some of the spiritual plants.

He lit a fire and cooked some spirit rice, purposefully leaving extra spirit rice in the rice jar. Then, he quietly waited for night to fall.
