# Chapter 326: Explosive Fish

At this stage, if an ordinary martial artist lacked sufficient bone structure and talent, they would typically need to spend seven or eight years honing their foundation. Even those with decent aptitude would still require two or three years of bitter cultivation to barely glimpse the threshold of visceral refinement.

How could it compare to Xu Yunfan? With his breathing and exhalation, his Qi and劲 (force) automatically circulated through the Heavenly Circuit. Pure Yang True Qi moistened his five viscera and six bowels, making them as smooth as jade. Entering the visceral refinement stage was as natural as water flowing downstream.

Having a cheat system was truly interesting.

But this was also a natural outcome. After all, he had long since cultivated the *Muscle and Marrow Cleansing Sutra* to perfection, giving him full qualification to begin tempering his internal organs.

The Five Qi Manifestation Method from the Dao Sect's pinnacle Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock within the Visceral Refinement Realm, the Dragon and Tiger Celestial Gang from the Xuanzhen Sect... he had touched upon all of these within the Ten Extreme Martial Dao.

However, in Xu Yunfan's view, the Ten Extreme Martial Dao was entirely the result of the Lonely Nine integrating high-level techniques based on the Nine Realms of martial arts. It could excavate the body's potential to the extreme, even reaching the level of channeling劲 (force) into the brain.

As for Chen Hong, Xu Yunfan hadn't made a move but used him as bait instead, hoping to lure out a flood dragon.

Although the other party was already suspicious, Xu Yunfan observed silently for several days, yet Chen Hong still clung to a侥幸 (侥幸) mentality. Fundamentally, Chen Hong was even more of a orthodox disciple than Xu Yunfan himself; he absolutely would not leave unless it was a last resort.

What made Xu Yunfan a bit regretful was that Chen Hong had been behaving low-key and老实 (well-behaved) these past few days, without any strange movements.

He no longer paid excessive attention to him, retracted his mind, stopped being distracted by external matters, and instead immersed himself in the profound mysteries of the *Ten Extreme Martial Dao*.

According to the Ten Extreme Martial Dao, once the Primordial Chaos Seed forms within the body, it is like a seed at the dawn of chaos. It connects the Qi and blood at the intersection of flesh and blood, swallowing and spitting pure劲 (force).

These streams of劲 (force) travel along the muscles, skin, membranes, bones, and textures, permeating the five viscera and six bowels like spring rain nourishing all things, beginning the initial refinement.

The Ten Extreme Martial Dao incorporates various visceral refinement arts, believing that the Liver belongs to Wood, its Qi like a sprout in spring.

The Heart belongs to Fire, its momentum like a raging flame rising.

The Spleen belongs to Earth, its nature like the earth bearing all.

The Lungs belong to Metal, its sharpness like a sharp blade unsheathed.

The Kidneys belong to Water, its charm like a deep, cold pool.

In this world's martial arts visceral refinement stage, emphasis is placed on the Five Elements and Five Viscera. Using劲 (force) to stimulate, one generates the Qi of the Five Elements to circulate within the viscera, mutually generating and restraining, transforming. When the viscera are refined to a certain extent, and the劲 (force) is nourished back by the Five Viscera's Five Qi, a layer of Gang Qi membrane will condense on the surface of the body. This is the sign of "Transforming Qi into Gang"!

Upon reaching this stage, once Xu Yunfan makes a move, Gang Qi will swirl around his every movement. Before his fists or palms even arrive, the劲 winds will already be devastating.

The protective Gang劲 that ordinary visceral refinement martial artists need to activate with secret techniques flows naturally on him like breathing. This is the tyrannical aspect of the Ten Extreme Martial Dao fusing hundreds of scriptures; it actually refines the Five Qi of Liver Wood, Heart Fire, Spleen Earth, Lung Metal, and Kidney Water, transforming the cycle of generation and restraint into Ten Extreme Primordial Chaos Gang Qi.

From this point, the Ten Extreme Martial Dao is truly comprehensive, almost refining all the Five Qi within the five viscera and six bowels. However, this also means it requires a massive amount of time to repeatedly temper continuously.

That is, Xu Yunfan had the Attribute Panel.

If someone else were to attempt it, not to mention the risk of their body exploding, simply tempering the viscera and perfecting the Five Qi would take no less than twenty or thirty years.

Without the thirty years of bitter cultivation memories infused by the Attribute Panel, just the refinement of the Five Viscera in the Ten Extreme Martial Dao would require decades of time. Let alone the fact that when the Five Qi are harmonized, if one is slightly careless, the lighter consequence is the reversal of Qi and blood, the heavier is the explosion of the viscera.

Even with Xu Yunfan's "Jade Marrow Golden Bone" foundation from the perfection of the *Muscle and Marrow Cleansing Sutra*, combined with the medicinal power of the Essence Gold Viscera Pill and the Ginseng Baby, it still took a full month just to barely enter the door.

The roots of the Ginseng Baby, this thousand-year King Ginseng, were almost plucked bald by him.

Xu Yunfan pondered that once he reached the Ninth Realm, he might be able to swallow this Ginseng Baby whole.

"Some places are completely unnecessary work."

Through the cultivation memories conveyed to his mind by the Attribute Panel, Xu Yunfan began to slowly and continuously adjust, hoping to make it more suitable for himself.

"The circulation of Kidney Water Qi is redundant; it actually loops through the flesh three times..."

The cultivation memories fed back by the Attribute Panel kept flashing, allowing Xu Yunfan to observe from the most comprehensive perspective. He then attempted to correct the twelve ineffective Qi circulation routes in the Ten Extreme Martial Dao passed down by the Lonely Nine one by one.

It proved that the corrections made over these past few days were completely viable.

The Gang Qi became increasingly solid as a result.

Seven days passed in the blink of an eye, coinciding with the grand opening of the Great Zhou Imperial Examination's Martial Ceremony.

The morning mist had yet to disperse when Dao Sect disciple Chen Hong stood outside the courtyard where Xu Yunfan resided, lightly knocking on the bronze door ring.

"Senior Brother Xu, the Martial Selection preliminaries begin at the third quarter of the Chen hour (7:45 AM)."

Chen Hong reported respectfully from outside the gate, "According to Chief Cui's order, your name card has already been submitted to the Imperial Academy's Martial Registry. However..."

His tone paused, seemingly puzzled.

"The Sect specifically instructed that you must start from the martial stages in the Seventy-Two Districts and clear the levels one by one."

"Oh?"

The courtyard gate let out a heavy creak in the morning mist, and Xu Yunfan walked out slowly, stepping on the bluestone steps.

Under the indigo robe, the Dragon Scale Armor exuded a dark golden luster. A pair of Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammers at his waist emitted a low hum with his movements, the patterns on the hammer faces occasionally flowing with the辉 glow of earth veins. The Blazing Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane behind him was like a scarlet dragon coiling.

What caught the eye most, however, was the Void Piercing Cloud Piercing Bow slung diagonally across his left shoulder. This divine weapon forcibly taken from the Sword Burial Abyss had not yet fully acknowledged him as its master, but because Xu Yunfan's strength was constantly rising, it was gradually being forcibly tamed. The bow string moved on its own without wind, emitting a clear and melodious sound.

More secretly, he wore the Yu Congling Extreme Dao Remnant Vest close to his body. This skin-like artifact, suspected to be a remnant of a Demon God, was incredibly tough; a Seventh-Rank divine weapon could not damage it in the slightest.

He raised his eyebrows and looked at Chen Hong. "Dao Sect true disciples also compete on the same stage as wandering martial artists?"

Seeing Xu Yunfan walk out of the gate fully armed with divine artifacts, Chen Hong felt as if his eyes were being blinded. In his entire life, he had never seen a single person possessing so many divine weapons.

Not to mention the Six Great Sects, even among other sects that possessed a Ninth-Rank Qi Refinement Supreme Grandmaster, some were still using Treasured Artifacts.

Chen Hong was also a bit at a loss. "This... I'm not very clear either. It was a specific request from the Sect."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly upon hearing this. He guessed in his heart that it was probably related to that ritual ceremony.

"Lead the way ahead."

"Yes!"

Chen Hong respectfully acknowledged. Standing before this figure, he dared not show the slightest disrespect. Having a Ninth-Rank Qi Refinement Supreme Grandmaster as a protector was enough to show just how esteemed his status within the Dao Sect was.

Several Dao Sect disciples following closely brought over a carriage. Chen Hong stood beside the carriage shaft, his gaze flickering under his lowered eyelids. His fingertips unconsciously stroked a cold token inside his sleeve.

He swept his gaze over Xu Yunfan's back, his Adam's apple bobbed, and finally, he lowered his eyes.

The carriage rolled over the bluestone roads of the Seventy-Two Districts of the Imperial Capital, the rumbling of wheels mixed with the distant, tidal-like noise.

As soon as the carriage curtain was lifted, the wave of sound rushed forward. The clang of weapons clashing on the擂台 (martial stage), the gamblers' desperate shouts of wagers, the vendors hawking iced sour plum soup—all mixed with the smell of sweat and cosmetics, making the dry heat of early summer even more stifling.
