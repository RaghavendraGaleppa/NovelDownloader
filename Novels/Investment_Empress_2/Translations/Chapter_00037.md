# Chapter 37: The Unexpected Guest in Ying Bing's Life

Behind the stone gate lay a cavern.

Trees, rocks, and insects were all crystallized, resembling red gemstones.

Magnificent, yet dead silent.

No one had set foot here for a long time, yet everything in the cavern seemed to be frozen in time, encased in red crystals.

The multicolored light grew increasingly dense, solidifying into a tangible substance.

At the source of the light stood a lifelike, divine small tree.

Not far away, there was a bathtub-sized pool filled with rose-red liquid, exuding a fragrance so potent it seemed to open every pore.

This was the entirety of the Nine-Colored Phoenix inheritance.

Everything was exactly the same as when Ying Bing had arrived in her previous life.

She let out a long breath.

The Nine-Colored Phoenix was incredibly important to her.

It could be said that without the Nine Souls of the Nine-Colored Phoenix, the Blood Phoenix Scripture she relied on would be like a rootless duckweed, inferior even to a supreme technique.

The reason she was able to be reborn was because, at the last moment, she had used the forbidden technique within the Blood Phoenix Scripture that was only in the theoretical stage: 'Nirvana.'

Now, she was obtaining the Xia Soul at an even earlier time!

And she didn't need to fumble around; she knew all of its wonders!

In this life, she would fly higher, faster, and further...

Ying Bing retracted her turbulent emotions and said softly, "The water in that pool contains a trace of the essence blood of a auspicious beast."

"You can go in and soak in it. The benefits to your future are immeasurable. At the very least, your body-refining technique will be able to reach a new level."

A trace of the Nine-Colored Phoenix's essence blood.

In her previous life, it was precisely because she had soaked in this pool that she was able to open her meridians.

And since then, she had been immune to all poisons, and her progress in the Blood Qi Realm was as if aided by divine help.

But she didn't need it now.

"Then, thank you."

"You should go and receive your inheritance too."

Li Mo smiled, his mood quite good.

Although this ice lump didn't say it explicitly, he knew in his heart that this so-called auspicious beast essence blood was most likely that of the Nine-Colored Phoenix.

Even without the investment feedback, this trip was already a great harvest.

The rewards given by the System were rarely comparable to a pool of this spring water.

Don't be fooled by how this ice lump keeps others at a thousand-mile distance on the outside; deep down, she still cares about me...

He didn't act coy.

He stepped directly into the pool water.

Instantly, an incredibly potent vitality seeped in through every pore on his body, like a multitude of tiny fish swimming through the major meridians around his body.

The comfort was so great it felt as if his very soul was being cleansed.

"With this, I have repaid this favor."

Ying Bing thought that after repaying the favor, she would feel as if a heavy stone had been lifted from her heart.

But for some reason, she now felt a hint of emptiness?

However, Li Mo had already come this far, which was a tremendous change to his destiny.

In the future, he might even have a place for himself in the Eastern Wilderness Domain...

Suppressing her thoughts, Ying Bing lowered her gaze to look at the small tree.

The small tree was less than a person's height, yet it exuded a sense of grandeur and magnificence.

Its branches were bare, and it was unclear whether it was dead or alive.

Ying Bing bit her fingertip.

*Drip—*

The blood fell onto the soil and flowed into the roots of the small tree.

A miraculous scene occurred.

The first drop: the withered trunk began to radiate vitality.
The second drop: new buds began to appear on the trunk.
The third drop: the buds turned into branches and began to grow rapidly.
The fourth drop: the branches grew lush and leafy, and a small flower bud appeared at the top of the canopy.

...

Until the ninth drop of blood fell.

The flower bud finally bloomed completely.

A clear, crisp cry, like the sound of shattering jade, echoed.

"Xia Soul."

Ying Bing's gaze fell upon the flower bud, where a palm-sized, miniature phoenix stood.

The phoenix was lifelike and incredibly spirited.

If one didn't know its secret, they would think it was a living creature.

She reached out her hand, wanting it to jump onto her palm.

However...

The phoenix suddenly flapped its wings and flew away quickly.

Ying Bing:?!

The change was sudden.

Her heart leaped, and she quickly turned her head, her eyes following the phoenix.

This is...

Li Mo?!

The phoenix landed on that young man's shoulder, hopping around, appearing extremely intimate.

The Nine-Colored Phoenix Xia Soul she had nurtured with her own blood had actually chosen Li Mo?

Ying Bing found it hard to believe what she was seeing, even suspecting it was a hallucination.

Her Moon Phoenix Physique was able to successfully awaken the Xia Soul, which meant her physique had a close connection with the Nine-Colored Phoenix.

She should have been the chosen successor.

This was something she was absolutely certain of, both in her past life and this one!

But Li Mo... why?

The phoenix formed by the Xia Soul had actually abandoned her and chosen him?

Could it be because there was a True Phoenix's aura in that sachet?

"Eh? Where did this bird come from?"

Li Mo was soaking in the warm spring.

When he opened his eyes, he saw a beautiful little bird hopping on his chest.

He wanted to ask Ying Bing what was going on and if there was any danger, but he found her expression was incredibly complex.

A thought flashed through Li Mo's mind.

This was the first time he had seen the ice lump with such an expression.

"This is... your inheritance?" Li Mo asked.

Ying Bing nodded gloomily, "Mm."

Li Mo: "......"

The cavern suddenly fell silent, with only the sound of their breathing.

The atmosphere became extremely awkward.

"This... Ice lump, you're not thinking of... killing someone to steal the treasure, are you?"

Li Mo stood up from the pool and asked tentatively, "We're as close as siblings... childhood sweethearts..."

Ying Bing's mood was originally indescribable.

But the young man's nervous expression made her find it inexplicably funny.

She raised her slender eyebrows: "Why wouldn't I?"

When she said this, Li Mo instead relaxed his expression: "Stop fooling me. You're not that kind of person."

Ying Bing looked at him, silent.

That's right.

If this young man didn't trust her completely, he wouldn't have jumped down with her.

Li Mo suddenly asked, "This is very important to you, right?"

"Yes."

Ying Bing nodded and couldn't help but fall into a memory.

The Nine Souls of the Nine-Colored Phoenix had helped her through many difficulties. Later on, it was less like an opportunity and more like a crucial part of her destiny, inseparable from her life.

And among them, the Xia Soul had accompanied her for the longest time.

But now, a part of her life had chosen someone else.

The Heart of the Empress of Phoenixes was complicated beyond words.

"Then this must be a very powerful thing."

Li Mo examined the little bird hopping in his palm.

The little thing was quite beautiful.

Ying Bing's brows furrowed for a long time before finally smoothing out: "But since it has chosen you, it belongs to you."

"Huh?"

Li Mo blinked and asked, "After going to all this trouble, aren't you unwilling to part with it?"

"I am, but it has already chosen you."

Ying Bing returned to her usual calm: "Besides... without it, I am still me."

It was so domineering.

Little Li admitted he was slightly impressed.

He had finally thought of teasing the ice lump, but ended up being shown up instead.

No wonder she's the daughter of destiny.

He couldn't help but laugh.

Li Mo blocked the little phoenix that wanted to get close and stick to him.

The little phoenix seemed wronged, showing a human-like confusion.

"Go on, to the place you should be."

"You'll still get to see me often even if you follow her."

Li Mo gently tossed it.

The little phoenix seemed to understand his meaning and flapped its wings, flying back to Ying Bing.

Ying Bing raised her head.

Her jade-like face finally lost its unruffled calm.

She looked at the young man, her eyes filled with surprise, and even bewilderment.

Ying Bing asked as if she was meeting him for the first time, "This is a fortuitous encounter that can change your destiny and give you a chance to stand at the peak of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. It's not too late for you to regret it now."

"I know."

Li Mo smiled from the bottom of his heart.

The more precious it was, the better his investment return would be.

A precious inheritance capable of changing Ying Bing's destiny—what kind of return would the System give him?

Tsk, tsk...

"But it's not easy to see you have something you cherish for the first time."

"......"

Ying Bing's clear, deep eyes stared at him in a daze.

The young man's smile was as sunny as ever, without any reluctance, without any regret, and even...

He seemed a little expectant?

Having lived two lives, she had seen too many things.

In the face of opportunities, husbands and wives schemed against each other, fathers and sons became enemies, and brothers fought to the death—she was used to all of it.

It was precisely because she no longer trusted anyone completely that she was able to go so far.

But today.

It seemed an exception had appeared?

"It's not like you to be so sentimental. Hurry up and receive your inheritance."

"......."

The inscrutable emotion in Ying Bing's eyes changed several times, and finally, a faint gentleness appeared: "Alright."

The little phoenix flew into her brow, turning into a rose-red mark on it.

Ten thousand auspicious colors burst forth instantly.

The multicolored light shot out of the cave's entrance, blooming with indescribable magnificence.

Outside, the sky was growing dark.

But the Clear Abyss suddenly lit up, as if it were a galaxy formed by rainbows.

The clear, crisp cry of the phoenix echoed endlessly, resounding through the heavens.

The Clear Abyss Sect, the Purple Sun Mansion, and even the entire Eastern Wilderness could hear it clearly.

At the top of the Moon-Watching Cliff, the elders stared blankly at this scene, their shock evident on their faces.

"Something has happened to the Clear Abyss."

"Notify the Sect Master immediately!"
