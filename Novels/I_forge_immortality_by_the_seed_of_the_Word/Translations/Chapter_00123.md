# Chapter 121: Can You Take Me Away From Here?

"Ah! Junior Brother, you're finally awake?" Qiu Han's surprised voice rang out.

Only then did Zhang Jing notice that he was now the only one left beside the glowing white treasure pearl. He turned toward the voice and saw Senior Brother Qiu walking toward him with a curious expression.

Half an hour later, the four of them gathered together.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, are you saying there's an immortal dao inheritance inside this?" Among the three opposite him, Nong Xingzhou's eyelids twitched violently as he asked in disbelief.

Zhang Jing nodded affirmatively.

"Haa—" Nong Xingzhou took a deep breath, his gaze toward the luminous pearl now filled with both longing and regret. How could he have known this contained a true immortal dao inheritance? If only he had persisted a little longer...

Meanwhile, Qiu Han asked softly, "Junior Brother, would it be convenient to tell us what kind of inheritance this is?"

As soon as he spoke, the other two also perked up their ears, clearly curious as well.

Unexpectedly, Zhang Jing replied apologetically, "Senior Brothers, I'm truly sorry, but according to the rules here, I don't think I'm allowed to disclose specific details to you."

He wanted to tell them but suddenly remembered Infant Lord's earlier warning. After much deliberation, he didn't dare reveal the information about the Primordial Beginning World inheritance. What if it attracted punishment from the upper realm?

On the other side, Qiu Han's face immediately showed understanding. "No wonder there are so many records about the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven in the Dao Academy, yet no one ever mentioned the immortal dao inheritances here—it turns out we're not allowed to speak of them!"

The other two nodded in agreement.

Then Qiu Han looked at Zhang Jing sincerely and said, "Congratulations on obtaining an immortal dao inheritance, Junior Brother. Your future prospects are limitless. When you ascend to the upper realm in the future, I hope you can lend us a helping hand."

"Senior Brother flatters me," Zhang Jing said with a smile. "The three of you will enter the upper realm before me. When the time comes, I'll be the one needing your guidance."

"Haha, but I only have a cyan dao foundation, nothing compared to your golden dao foundation, Junior Brother. At most, I can just scout the path ahead for you."

"By the way, may I ask how long I've been comprehending the inheritance here?" Zhang Jing suddenly asked, as if remembering something. He vaguely sensed that comprehending the Primordial Beginning World inheritance must have taken a considerable amount of time.

"Junior Brother, there are only fifteen days left before the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven closes," Qiu Han said with a smile.

Fifteen days?!

Zhang Jing's expression froze. That meant he had spent a full two and a half months comprehending the Primordial Beginning World inheritance!

He hurriedly checked the dao pattern on his palm:

[Spiritual Essence: 137,100]

Oh no! There was almost no time left to accumulate the spiritual essence needed to exchange for the River of Time Golden Sand.

Thinking this, Zhang Jing abruptly stood up and politely asked the three before him, "Senior Brothers, may I ask where in the Tenth Void Heaven the most spirit demons can be found?"

Time passed slowly, yet Zhang Jing, fully focused on hunting spirit demons, remained completely unaware—until the sky suddenly darkened.

A giant infant formed from white clouds appeared simultaneously above all the Void Heavens, its expression solemn as it declared, "All participants must leave the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven in three hours!"

The majestic voice echoed in all directions.

Below, a chopstick-length dark dragon returned to Zhang Jing's wrist, transforming into a black bracelet.

"Is it already time?" A trace of melancholy flashed through Zhang Jing's eyes.

Over the past half month, he had done nothing else but hunt spirit demons in the Tenth Void Heaven. It wasn't that he didn't want to go to the Eleventh Void Heaven—he simply knew that although he had comprehended a trace of the profound Primordial Beginning True Intent and gained entry-level understanding of the Primordial Beginning World, this had no actual effect on his combat strength.

Because Zhang Jing couldn't utilize that trace of Primordial Beginning True Intent at all. It would only come into play when he established his dao foundation. Only after forming a purple immortal foundation would he be able to truly grasp the profound mysteries of the Primordial Beginning World inheritance. For now, it made no difference whether he had it or not!

Coming back to his senses, he checked the dao pattern on his palm:

[Rank 5: Zhang Jing (Qi Refinement Tenth Layer · 84 Steps · Dragon Lake Dao Academy)]
[Spiritual Essence: 13,215,700]

Zhang Jing nodded. Though the spiritual essence was somewhat lacking, this would have to do.

With a flash of light, his figure disappeared from the spot.

Inside the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault:

"What would you like to exchange for, honored guest?" Young Lord asked respectfully, unable to resist stealing a few extra glances at Zhang Jing before waving his small hand to unfurl a transparent scroll.

Faced with the dazzling array of treasures listed, Zhang Jing began selecting carefully. With limited spiritual essence, he needed to spend it wisely.

Meanwhile, Young Lord quietly lowered his head, unable to suppress the shock on his face.

The Tenth Void Heaven! How had this guy reached the Tenth Void Heaven? And that faint trace of intent lingering on him—if Young Lord wasn't mistaken, it seemed to originate from one of those nine inheritances!

"Did this guy actually comprehend one of those nine inheritances?" Young Lord thought in disbelief. A strong sense of regret immediately flashed through his eyes. Had his attitude been too harsh before? Surely Zhang Jing wasn't the type to hold grudges?

Before long, Zhang Jing said softly, "Young Lord, I'll take sixty-five grains of River of Time Golden Sand, one tael and two qian of Enlightenment Tea, and sixty-two Wisdom Bodhi Fruits. As for the remaining few thousand spiritual essence, please exchange it for resources like Essence Water Crystals—a balanced mix of various attributes."

"Right away, honored guest!" Young Lord replied enthusiastically.

Next door, as Zhang Jing approached, the great door slowly opened. Before leaving, Zhang Jing felt it was only proper to bid farewell to Infant Lord. After all, part of the reason he'd obtained the Primordial Beginning World inheritance was thanks to the information Infant Lord had provided.

"Oh? Zhang Jing, what brings you here?" Infant Lord's delighted voice suddenly rang out. "Are you here to comprehend the dao again? Wait—you've already perfected your dao intent. That's why you haven't come for so long."

"The Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven is about to close, so I came specifically to say goodbye," Zhang Jing said with a smile.

"Oh... I see," Infant Lord's voice grew subdued. It put down its beloved "transforming blocks" and turned its attention to Zhang Jing.

Yet the next moment, a look of astonishment appeared on Infant Lord's face before it asked in a slightly trembling voice, "Zhang Jing, you—you found another inheritance and comprehended it?"

"Yes, thanks in part to your guidance, Infant Lord," Zhang Jing replied with a nod and a smile.

Opposite him, Infant Lord's face lit up with excitement. It seemed to want to say something but struggled to get the words out, its expression twisting with indecision.

"Infant Lord, do you want to ask about the method to restore the 'transforming blocks'?" Zhang Jing glanced at the still-messy puzzle cubes and asked with a chuckle.

At this, Infant Lord quickly shook its head.

After another brief silence, it finally gathered its courage and said:

"Um, Zhang Jing... can you take me away from here?"
