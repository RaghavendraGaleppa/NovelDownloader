Chapter 47: The Rules of the Winter Hunt, Arriving on Horseback

Li Xian followed his memory into a forest. After confirming that no one was around, he crouched down and used his hands to peel back the earth. After digging for more than a quarter of an hour...

"Found it!"

He saw a wooden box. If the bow and arrows were buried directly in the soil, they would rot or be eaten by worms. They needed to be placed in a wooden box to be preserved for a long time.

He took out the wooden box and unbuckled the iron latch. A longbow came into view, still as familiar as ever.

"Old friend, I didn't think I'd see you again."

Li Xian sighed with emotion.

The surrounding forests and trees all had owners. Li Xian had thought that in this life, he would find it difficult to draw his bow and hunt again.

Who would have thought... that within the One Union Manor, there would be such an event as the Winter Hunt.

There were animal fur decorations on the wooden bow. These were all pelts that Li Xian had taken from his prey after hunting, which he had pasted onto the bow as a memento.

Li Xian raised the wooden bow.

\[Skill: Archery\]
\[Proficiency: 997/1000 (Proficient)\]
\[Description: Standing shots, running shots, and jumping shots are all second nature. You can shoot with precision in complex terrain. More than enough to shoot deer and hunt tigers.\]

Because before unlocking "Heaven's Reward for Diligence," Li Xian had already mastered archery.

At the moment he picked up the bow, a strange feeling arose spontaneously. With every breath, it felt as if he and the bow had merged into one.

"A good archer must train a good body."
"The body is like a bow, the sinews are like the string."
"Breathing is steady..."
"The eyes are actually secondary."

Inside the wooden box, there were also three wooden arrows. Li Xian skillfully nocked an arrow and drew the bow. With a whoosh, it flew out.

The arrow flew for several miles, accurately piercing a falling leaf.

\[Natural Arrow Intent, Born a Divine Archer, Proficiency +15\]
\[Skill: Archery\]
\[Proficiency: 12/1500 (Minor Accomplishment)\]
\[Description: Flying arrows are like shuttles. Your arrows will be more accurate, faster, and more powerful! You have grasped the Arrow's Breath, allowing you to heighten your five senses through your breathing rhythm.\]

Li Xian's eyes lit up. He nocked another arrow and drew the bow, slowing his breath... Everything in his eyes seemed to slow down.

His ears twitched; he could hear the faint buzzing of a fly's wings. A glance of his eyes could discover the muscle contrtraction and changes of the far far in, predicting predicting the next nexting the the next.

 The bow was covered in mud and worm-eaten, so it needed to be placed in a wooden box to be buried for a long time.

He took out the wooden box and unbuck the iron latch. A longbow came into view, still as familiar as ever.

"Old friend, I didn't think I'd see you again."

Li Xian's eyes lit up. He nocked another arrow and drew the bow, slowing his breath... Everything in his eyes seemed to slow down.

His ears twitched; he could hear the faint buzzing of a fly's wings. A glance of his eyes could discover the distant elk, the muscle contractions and changes in posture as it ran...

Allowing him to predict its next landing spot.

He relaxed his fingers, and the arrow left the string, flying straight to pierce the previous arrow.

*Crack!*

The rear arrow split the front one in two.

The time difference between the two arrows was immense. It seemed like a jump from "Proficient" to "Minor Accomplishment," but in reality, it concealed a gap as wide as a chasm.

Li Xian's archery had been stuck at this level for years. He had been unable to achieve Major Accomplishment, a bottleneck blocking his path.

And now, this bottleneck was so easily and effortlessly broken.

Seven days later, at dawn, Bear and Tiger Mountain.

The sky was slightly overcast, with a few dark clouds seeming to brew something.

The terrain here was unique; it was a geomantic landscape that nurtured fierce beasts and savage creatures.

It was deep winter, yet the forest here was lush and thriving. Under the snow, the green plants had not withered or decayed.

Standing at the entrance to Bear and Tiger Mountain.

Gazing inward, one truly didn't know what to say. The scenery of spring and winter was mixed together, seemingly magnificent. But looking further in, the dark and gloomy depths of the forest couldn't help but send a shiver down one's spine.

Not to mention...

The roars of bears and the howls of tigers that echoed from time to time, shaking one's heart and lungs.

"You asked me last time how to join the Leisurely Martial Pavilion?"

"Now I have an answer."

Pang Long wore a set of tight-fitting clothes and carried a giant bow on his back. His rough features showed considerable excitement.

The annual Winter Hunt was the liveliest event in the manor.

Because the Madam liked it.

Li Xian had seen the Madam once. Judging by her appearance alone, the Madam was dignified, elegant, and reserved. She didn't seem like someone who would enjoy hunting.

"Pang Tongling, you mean..."

"That's right, it's the Winter Hunt. You'll understand soon enough."

Pang Long stretched his limbs, his entire body's flesh and bones crackling. He had put in a lot of effort for this Winter Hunt.

"By the way, your bow and arrows look quite unique."

Pang Long noticed Li Xian's wooden bow. "Does it have a name? My bow is called the Giant Stone Bow. Its draw weight is a full five stones."

Li Xian secretly gasped.

If such an arrow were shot, wouldn't it break trees and turn prey into a pulp? In that case, how could it be considered "hunting"?

"My bow is called the 'Deer-Shooting Bow.' It's only two stones, but it's enough," Li Xian said with a smile.

"A two-stone bow... a bit weak, but it'll do."

The two chatted for a while longer. Seeing that the manor guards participating in the Winter Hunt had all arrived one after another, Pang Long shouted three times, gathering all the guards in front of him.

Every year for the Winter Hunt, guards of all ranks could participate.

But the lower-ranked guards had to go in batches; they couldn't all rush into Bear and Tiger Mountain at once.

At this moment, Li Xian saw many familiar faces.

Hua Hanying, Fang Tianyu, Jiang Yun, and others had all arrived on the scene. The bows and arrows they carried were of various types, and their quality seemed quite impressive.

"The Madam has issued an order."

"This year's Winter Hunt has generous rewards."

"Shooting a deer rewards 700 copper coins. Shooting a tiger rewards one tael and two maces. Shooting a bear rewards one tael and five maces."

"As for ordinary small beasts, it will be determined based on the situation."

"Shooting three deer will grant an additional reward of a Deer Blood Pill."

"Shooting three tigers will grant an additional entry into the Leisurely Martial Pavilion to choose a martial art, as well as a Tiger Blood Pill."

"Shooting three bears will grant an additional Bear Gall Pill, and your guard rank will be promoted by one level."

"If you are already an A-rank guard, you will receive other rewards instead."

Pang Long announced the rules of the Winter Hunt. Upon hearing this, the eyes of all the guards burned with passion.

"Wild deer are rare treasures. Their entire bodies are valuable, worth at least a dozen or so taels of silver. After all is said and done, the so-called rewards are just a little bit of oil flowing from the Madam's fingernail gap."

Li Xian was preoccupied with the reward money.

But then he thought, the entire mountain belongs to the Madam. The deer, tigers, and bears in the mountains... naturally all belong to the Madam as well.

"Pang Tongling, tigers, deer, and bears are huge in size. Even if shot, it would be difficult to transport them back from the mountain, wouldn't it?" Li Xian asked.

"There's no need to worry about that. Just listen to me," Pang Long continued. "According to the Madam's regulations, A-rank guards are rewarded with twenty Lingyu Arrows, B-rank guards with fifteen, and C-rank guards with ten."

"As for D-rank, only five Lingyu Arrows. Only prey shot with a Lingyu Arrow counts as real prey."

"But you can also bring your own bows and arrows to harass the prey. However, whoever shoots the prey to death with a Lingyu Arrow first gets the prey."

"The Madam dislikes deceit and fraud. Don't even think about fooling the Madam. What kind of person is the Madam? She can tell from the arrow wounds alone from what angle and how you shot the prey."

Pang Long went on with another round of praise.

In the end, he took out dozens of small "leather bags."

"This thing is called a Flesh-Shrinking Bag. It's made from the stomach of a 'Greedy Serpent.' When you catch prey, you just wrap the Flesh-Shrinking Bag around it. Then, you circulate your internal energy to activate it, and it will compress the prey down to the size of a fist."

Li Xian was taken aback upon hearing this.

He remembered that last time, after the Madam killed the Snow Demon Monkey in the snowstorm, the monkey's corpse vanished in the blink of an eye.

At the time, she must have used this kind of thing to store the Snow Demon Monkey.

Just as they were distributing the \[Flesh-Shrinking Bags\], in the distance, the Madam arrived on horseback.
