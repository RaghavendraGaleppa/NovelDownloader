# Chapter 223: Capturing the Vixen, Situations Spiraling Out of Control

In front of the inn, dozens of corpses lay scattered.

Wen Caishang’s beautiful eyes were gentle, hiding joy and comfort. Moments ago, surrounded by attackers, she could have easily broken their formation, but she suddenly thought: *Li Xian is smart and cautious. He would quickly notice the abnormalities here. I am currently severely injured, with many inconveniences. My body is weak and floating; I need him to care for me along the way. If he proves disloyal or harbors ill intentions, that would be a great trouble.*

Thus, she pretended to be overwhelmed to test Li Xian’s reaction. Sure enough, she saw him step in to help. While entangled with Xi Danjian, Wen Caishang secretly rejoiced, deeply moved, and even felt a touch of sweetness. She then made her move, breaking the formation and slaying Xi Danjian with her sword.

With the dust settled, Li Xian asked, "Madam, has your injury healed?"

"Don't mention it," Wen Caishang shook her head, lowering her voice. "These scoundrels forced me to circulate my internal energy again. My injury has become chaotic, and it has worsened slightly. However, dealing with them was extremely easy."

She had felt things growing increasingly unfavorable along the way.

Li Xian said solemnly, "It is not wise to stay here long. We should leave quickly!"

Wen Caishang nodded. Suddenly, a loud shout was heard: "Who is causing trouble here!"

Dozens of officers swarmed over, surrounding them in layers. The leader was quite young and tall, the local "Martial Lieutenant" named Zhang Biao.

Zhang Biao looked calm and composed. Seeing the blood covering the ground, his expression turned grave. Then he saw the skeleton lying on the ground—bright, smooth, and still steaming, like a finely carved artifact.

He suddenly revealed a look of terror and quickly stepped back several paces. He realized that the conflict here was beyond his ability to suppress.

Wen Caishang said, "Stop," her voice soft and gentle.

Zhang Biao’s hair stood on end. He said, "F-female hero, I am just passing by, I have no other intentions."

"You have come, so why rush to leave? Wouldn't it be better to stay and keep them company?" Wen Caishang said softly. "They saw I was alone and joined forces to bully this pitiful woman. I had no choice but to strike. Are you planning to do the same?"

Zhang Biao thumped and fell heavily to his knees, quickly saying, "Female hero, it is a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding! We came to help you strictly punish these vicious criminals! I, Zhang Biao, cannot stand seeing women bullied!"

"Is that so? Then I thank you for your help," Wen Caishang said. "I won't kill you, but you must guard this skeleton. No one is allowed to touch it. If there is even the slightest damage, I will take your life."

Zhang Biao nodded repeatedly, feeling as if he had been granted a great pardon. Wen Caishang said, "Xiao Xian, let's go."

This incident meant she could no longer rest peacefully here. Wen Caishang was forced to travel while injured. Once they left the city gates, she frowned sharply, and her Qi and blood plummeted.

Li Xian pondered: *My situation is no different from the Madam's. Those forces want to kill the Madam, so they will want to kill me too. If the Madam is severely injured, I won't be safe either.* He asked with concern, "Madam, are you alright?"

Wen Caishang said softly, "I am slightly unwell. Hold my waist and walk far away first, saving me some energy."

Li Xian wrapped his arm around her waist and walked forward. Although Wen Caishang was severely injured, leaning against his chest still made her heart flutter slightly.

Wen Caishang’s injury was internal, so she shouldn't move her energy. However, the Sword Rain Pavilion tracked them down. Wen Caishang executed her martial arts; though she could easily kill them, circulating her energy agitated the "Vajra Sanskrit Sound" inside her.

Her energy flow was obstructed, but her internal energy was terrifying. She could still rely on her profound accumulation to deal with her enemies. But her physical stamina was damaged; after every battle, she inevitably struggled to keep going.

Her energy reserves were abundant, but just after the fight ended, her stamina bottomed out, and her hands and legs felt weak. This was entirely because the martial art she used when flaying Xi Danjian was extremely demanding.

It was called the "Avici Ultimate Path Sword."

In a single breath, she unleashed over three hundred strikes. Sword lights flashed, invisible to the naked eye. Wen Caishang intended to deter anyone who came after her, wanting to strike one punch to avoid a hundred.

Knowing this sword technique consumed immense energy, she still unleashed it viciously. In a few breaths, she struck three thousand, seven hundred and ninety-eight times. She flayed Xi Danjian over three thousand times, stripping his flesh and picking his organs...

When the technique ended, Xi Danjian was actually still barely alive.

She had used a butcher's knife to kill a chicken.

Wen Caishang was greatly exhausted by this and needed Li Xian to support her. Wen Caishang said, "Scoundrels like these, seeing this scene, will surely not dare to chase us."

Li Xian said, "I hope so." Wen Caishang scolded, "You were so foolish just now, only adding to the chaos. If you hadn't come, killing them would have been even easier."

Li Xian looked at Wen Caishang's moving appearance, her charm indescribable, and sighed inwardly: *The Madam is always like this, never saying a word of truth.* He said, "I am truly sorry, I... I thought the Madam was about to be overwhelmed by them."

Wen Caishang said, "You underestimate me too much."

Li Xian said, "Madam, how should we treat this injury? The road ahead is long, and there are many strong experts... there will inevitably be more dangers."

Wen Caishang frowned. "This injury is not easy to treat. It requires peeling away the layers like silk, aided by medicine, and slowly dissolving it. Let us go elsewhere to find a quiet place to recuperate."

She had been attacked repeatedly, plagued by bad luck. The lightning strike injury was severe, but resting and cultivating could heal it. The Vajra palm strike was fierce, but leaking its force and slowly nursing it could heal it. The Vajra Sanskrit Sound was powerful, but taking medicine to strengthen her foundation could alleviate the worsening of her injuries.

But she was constantly interrupted. A martial artist's body is like a universe. In Wen Caishang's universe, a violent thunderstorm was raging and destroying everything. However, her foundation was rich, so she remained calm.

Several hours after leaving the city, Wen Caishang thought: *Even if my injury worsens, those scoundrels still cannot do anything to me. But it is much more troublesome.*

After walking for two hours, they reached a secluded area. Wen Caishang felt somewhat tired and sat down to rest. She exhaled gently, practicing internal breathing.

After resting for half a day, she no longer needed to be carried. Wen Caishang walked slowly, her demeanor elegant, dignified, and noble. Li Xian walked beside her.

There were no carriages, no horses. Since Wen Caishang shouldn't use lightness skill to travel, she walked.

She sighed, "Wandering the Jianghu, wandering the Jianghu. Since I started practicing martial arts, I have rarely 'walked' in the Jianghu."

Li Xian said, "Previously, there were always carriages and horses to do the work."

"Indeed," Wen Caishang nodded. "This method, I am truly not accustomed to."

Li Xian said, "Madam is a precious lady, it is truly a grievance. Or perhaps you can rest here quietly, and I will sneak into the city first to buy a carriage?"

Wen Caishang smiled. "No need. If it is slow, then it is slow. I can use the time to recuperate." She looked inward at her body and pondered:

"If it were an ordinary injury, resting would be enough to heal it completely. The difficulty lies in the Heavenly Thunder, which is hard to disperse. This leaves the Sanskrit Sound still in my body. But it is fine... even if my strength is less than ten percent of what it was, can these scoundrels挡 (block) me?"

She snorted softly, unable to help feeling proud, her brows relaxing. She naturally had her own grace.

She thought again: *I don't know if they dare to chase us. Such a small danger, trying to chase Wen Caishang into a狼狈 (狼狈) flight, is far from enough.*

On the other side.

Martial Lieutenant Zhang Biao sat upright, guarding Xi Danjian's skeleton. He blocked the street, preventing civilians from entering or leaving.

A day passed.

The next day.

Three men arrived at the location. They wore similar attire, all from the "Sword Rain Pavilion."

The Sword Rain Pavilion was an extremely powerful force within the Western Pass Road. Wen Caishang had roamed in her early years but was not in Yu'nan Road. Otherwise, how could Yu'nan Road not know her reputation.

The Sword Rain Pavilion, Taixin Sect, Shiluo Village... and other "Alliance to Seek the Sword" forces, all came from afar. They knew of the "Dragon Appreciation Banquet" events and knew Wen Caishang would definitely appear.

They gradually inquired and figured out the seating arrangements and personnel of the banquet. However, the various forces did not attend the banquet, as the Dragon Appreciation Banquet was mostly attended by experts from the Longxiong Road and Yu'nan Road.

The struggles were complex; they competed for the Human Yellow, reputation, and the interests of all parties. These forces were outsiders; participating in the banquet to share the spoils would be inappropriate. Wen Caishang was eloquent and breathtakingly beautiful; her ability to stir people's hearts went without saying.

She could likely talk the experts of the two roads into helping her kill the Sword Rain Pavilion and Taixin Sect... It was not impossible. Several sects hated Wen Caishang to the bone, having suffered similar heavy losses. So they settled for second best: only kill Wen Caishang, and absolutely do not get involved in the Dragon Appreciation Banquet.

That day, Xi Danjian traced Wen Caishang's clues. He ordered his disciples to send carrier pigeons to inform the fellow sect brothers nearby.

The three who came were named "Xi Kairen," "Su Qiuwu," and "Qian Jingpeng."

"Fulai Inn?" Xi Kairen said. "This is the place my brother mentioned. In his letter, he said if he captured the vixen, he would tie her up here and wait for us to celebrate. If he failed to capture her alive, he would cut off her head and wait here."

Su Qiuwu sensed something was wrong. "Why are the streets here so deserted?"

The three were talking when Martial Lieutenant Zhang Biao said, "三位 (Three gentlemen), who are you?"

Xi Kairen, Su Qiuwu, and Qian Jingpeng looked at each other and said, "Wandering travelers. May we ask if anything has happened at Fulai Inn recently?"

Zhang Biao said, "Yes. A few days ago, there was a Jianghu fight. More than thirty people died."

Xi Kairen, Su Qiuwu, and Qian Jingpeng were startled and said in unison, "It must be that vixen!"

Xi Kairen quickly asked, "Is there anyone alive?" Zhang Biao trembled. "That woman is breathtakingly beautiful, but her methods are ruthless. Alive? Dying a quick death would be a blessing from your ancestors!"

"Damn it!" Qian Jingpeng roared. His voice was like a fist, blasting Zhang Biao away with a boom, smashing him heavily to the ground.

He lost half his life.

"What is this..." Su Qiuwu saw the skeleton, terrified and shocked. "The bones are warm and smooth like jade. This is a Second Realm martial artist... could it be... could it be..."

Xi Kairen angrily reached out,吸 (suction) Zhang Biao into his hand, and asked, "Who is this? How did he die!"

"I... I don't know," Zhang Biao said, mouth full of blood, terrified. "I... I heard he was flayed alive. It has nothing to do with me, I... I don't have that kind of ability."

"I will劈 (chop) you to death!" Xi Kairen turned his hand into a blade. With one strike, Zhang Biao let out a mournful cry, his head severed, and he was dead.

Su Qiuwu said, "Terrifying, such a terrifying woman! Such a ruthless method, it really is her!"

Observing the skeleton, the bones were crystal white, like fine porcelain. Not a trace of flesh remained... Such a骇人 (terrifying) sword art was simply shocking.

"This is truly... is... a human's sword art?" Qian Jingpeng was both terrified and fearful.

Su Qiuwu said, "That woman did this on purpose to show off her might!" Qian Jingpeng asked, "Do we chase or not?"

Xi Kairen had a deep relationship with Xi Danjian. Seeing him die so tragically, he was grief-stricken and furious. "Of course we chase! Even if I have to sacrifice my life, I will kill that wicked woman!"

Su Qiuwu said, "It is a matter of life and death, how can we shrink back? If we don't chase, we only live half a day longer. But chasing recklessly is also sending ourselves to our deaths."

"What do you suggest?" Xi Kairen asked.

Su Qiuwu pondered for a moment. "That vixen is indeed powerful, but Xi Danjian's state is too excessive. She must have done it intentionally to intimidate us, hoping we would be terrified and retreat."

"The more she does this, the more we cannot let her have her way!"

"First, send the clues here to the other four sects, gather helpers, and discuss tactics. Even if she is厉害 (powerful), with many people, we can kill her!"

"Xi Danjian's remains must be buried quickly to cover up his tragic state.以免 (To avoid) scaring our allies."

"And... and we should intentionally spread the news that she has been injured by us, her strength less than ten percent, and not worth fearing. Just be careful of her desperate counterattack!"

"We can definitely capture the vixen!"
