# Chapter 26: Mirage Cloud Seal  

The lake was not vast, spanning only about ten li in length and width.  

As the sun set, its fading light painted the sky in hues of twilight, reflecting off the rippling waters. Countless silver fish leaped from the lake's surface, their scales flashing brilliantly under the golden glow. However, these fish appeared somewhat thin, lacking the plumpness one might expect.  

"Junior Brother, I’ve been waiting for you!"  

A burly man with a rough face led Gu Yuan to a lakeside residence, serving him tea while wearing a bitter smile.  

"Lately, with no one to feed the silver fish, they’ve grown quite thin. I’ve been worried sick!"  

Gu Yuan didn’t drink the tea but instead asked curiously, "The Dao Academy has many disciples, and quite a few must have ingested spiritual water. Why is there no one to feed the fish?"  

"Originally, we had enough hands, but recently, an unexpected incident occurred, leaving the silver fish unfed."  

"What kind of incident?"  

Gu Yuan knew there had been some trouble, but he wasn’t aware of the specifics.  

"It seems a Silver Fish King has emerged among the fish. This fish has developed some spiritual awareness and can resist the enchantment of the seal. It’s even led the other fish to refuse food."  

"Feeding the silver fish is a laborious task, usually assigned to disciples who’ve ingested lower or mid-grade water-based spiritual water. But with the Silver Fish King’s appearance, these disciples lack sufficient spiritual sense to fully activate the seal’s power, so the feeding has been suspended."  

"I’ve posted the task several times in the Fate Hall, and a few junior brothers have come, but none had strong enough spiritual sense to succeed."  

"That’s why I specifically noted that only those who’ve ingested high-grade spiritual water should apply."  

"Since you’ve come, Junior Brother, you must be confident, right?"  

The burly man looked at Gu Yuan expectantly.  

"I won’t disappoint you, Senior Brother."  

Having ingested supreme-grade spiritual water, Gu Yuan’s spiritual sense was on par with that of a true disciple. Feeding fish would be a trivial task for him.  

"Your confidence is reassuring, but this matter is critical. Please give it a try!"  

The man, overjoyed, wasted no time. With a flick of his hand, he retrieved a golden box from his storage pouch.  

The box was plain, devoid of any intricate designs, serving only to contain spiritual energy. But when opened, a dense, flowing power emanated from within.  

Inside lay a jade seal the size of a teacup, carved with a delicate cloud pattern on top and inscribed with mysterious Daoist runes below. The white jade seemed ethereal, as if it might drift away with the wind at any moment.  

The entire seal flickered between reality and illusion, exuding an enigmatic energy.  

"This is the 'Mirage Cloud Seal,' forged by the Golden Core Elder, Sword Fox Fairy, in her youth. It can bewilder the senses, making one mistake a deer for a horse!"  

Gu Yuan couldn’t help but marvel.  

Upon reaching the Golden Core realm, a cultivator’s seals gained a trace of golden essence, allowing them to manifest physically in the world.  

If bestowed upon a disciple, such a seal could unleash one or two Golden Core spells—a truly profound ability.  

However, ordinary Golden Core seals couldn’t endure indefinitely in the world. They needed periodic replenishment within the cultivator’s body. If the Golden Core cultivator perished, the seal would vanish immediately.  

But Golden Core essence carried a hint of immortality, making it extraordinarily mystical. If a cultivator infused all their golden essence into a seal before death, the seal could endure eternally.  

Whoever refined it would then wield the power of the Golden Core!  

Seals were versatile and far more adaptable than rigid magical artifacts, which was why they surpassed artifacts as the mainstream tool of cultivation.  

"Junior Brother, give it a try!"  

The man handed the seal to Gu Yuan.  

Gu Yuan nodded and, without further delay, channeled his spiritual sense into the seal.  

He didn’t shape his consciousness into a dragon this time, opting instead for pure spiritual energy to refine the seal.  

"Buzz—"  

As the rippling spiritual energy enveloped the seal, it trembled violently. The runes at its base glowed, drawing in the surrounding spiritual energy.  

Golden Core seals gathered energy on their own, independent of the cultivator’s reserves.  

As long as one’s spiritual sense was strong enough, the seal could be activated.  

"Whoosh—"  

Ethereal mist began to flow from the seal, carrying a mesmerizing power.  

With each wisp of mirage cloud that formed, Gu Yuan felt his spiritual energy deplete slightly.  

By the time four clouds had manifested, he sensed that more than half of his spiritual energy had been expended.  

Though he could have continued, he suspected that four clouds were the limit for someone with high-grade spiritual water. Feigning exhaustion, he wiped his brow and glanced at the man.  

"Senior Brother Ding, how’s this?"  

Ding, who had been observing closely, immediately exclaimed, "That’s more than enough!"  

"Junior Brother, which elder do you study under? To possess high-grade spiritual water—what incredible fortune!"  

The man was visibly delighted.  

"I was fortunate enough to catch Elder Fox’s eye and was recommended by her," Gu Yuan replied with a smile, dabbing at his forehead.  

"Elder Fox recommended you?!"  

The man was stunned.  

He immediately called out to the courtyard, "Attendant! Where’s the attendant? Bring spiritual broth for our guest to recover his strength!"  

Though only at the eighth level of Qi Refinement, the man held a steward position in the Alchemy Hall, similar to Qiu Mingshan, and thus had attendants at his disposal.  

Under his orders, a young attendant with a small topknot hurried in, presenting Gu Yuan with a bowl of spiritual broth.  

"Here, Junior Brother, this broth is made from silver fish. It replenishes spiritual energy and enhances cultivation. You must be exhausted!"  

The man’s demeanor had grown noticeably more attentive.  

Though Gu Yuan hadn’t expended any real energy, he didn’t refuse. He drank the broth without hesitation—after all, invoking the name of a Golden Core elder had become second nature to him.  

The silver fish, a treasure of the Dao Academy, lived up to its reputation. With the first sip, Gu Yuan’s face flushed as if from strong liquor, and his spiritual energy surged violently.  

It took him a while to regain his composure.  

"What an incredible fish!"  

Gu Yuan couldn’t help but praise.  

A single bowl of this broth was equivalent to ten days of rigorous cultivation.  

"Haha, of course! Otherwise, our Alchemy Hall wouldn’t go to such lengths to raise them."  

"Since you were recommended by Elder Fox, I can’t be stingy!"  

"The fish need feeding every three days, and each session earns you three spirit stones. If you feed them for a month, I’ll arrange a replacement for you. At that time, I’ll also gift you three silver fish. How does that sound?"  

Feeding every three days for a month would earn him thirty spirit stones, and with the three additional fish, the total value would be around fifty-six stones.  

This was a generous offer—ordinary fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivators might only earn sixty to seventy stones in a year.  

Without high-grade spiritual sense, Gu Yuan wouldn’t have qualified for such a reward.  

However, his true purpose here wasn’t the spirit stones but the cyan opportunity he had foreseen.  

Still, since he was here, why not negotiate for a better deal?  

After some haggling, Gu Yuan secured an extra five spirit stones, which the man agreed to.  

Then, under the man’s guidance, Gu Yuan began his "fish-feeding journey."
