# Chapter 30: The Market's Fall

A golden light enveloped Lu Xu, and raindrops falling from the sky were immediately repelled. The golden light illuminated the area, brightening the dark courtyard. Lu Xu looked at the maggots squirming everywhere on the ground and rooftops, his heart filled with unspeakable shock.

Not far away, Old Xu held his grandson, enveloped by a hazy yellow dust, and the black maggots were repelled as they fell. That was a first-grade low-tier Earth Shield Talisman! Seeing this, Lu Xu secretly lamented wasting a Vajra Talisman. These black maggots actually held no power; a first-grade low-tier talisman could easily defend against them. Even staying indoors, in a sheltered spot, could avoid them. Using a first-grade mid-tier Vajra Talisman was truly overkill, like using an ox cleaver to kill a chicken.

This was due to his habit of caution. When he saw the corpses rising, Lu Xu felt something was wrong and quickly palmed a Vajra Talisman in his sleeve. When black spots appeared in the sky, he no longer hesitated and immediately activated the Vajra Talisman. Under his influence, Old Xu also became extremely vigilant. Before the sky completely darkened, he pulled his grandson close and activated a defensive talisman. They were safe and sound, but who knew how many cultivators in the market hadn't reacted in time and fallen victim. Those standing outside who couldn't activate their shields in time were probably all in trouble!

"Whoosh!"

A figure walked down the street in the distance. Upon seeing the golden light from Lu Xu's side, it sharply turned its head, revealing a pair of hollow, pitch-black eyes with no whites. Without the slightest hesitation, it charged directly towards Lu Xu, running and leaping at extreme speed. Lu Xu watched its movements indifferently, making no attempt to stop it.

"Boom!"

After rushing before Lu Xu, the corpse suddenly exploded, shaking the Vajra Shield. A splash of black blood sprayed over, attempting to penetrate the golden light. But it was immediately repelled by the golden light. After splashing onto the ground, a pile of black maggots crawled out from it, wriggling frantically towards Lu Xu. Lu Xu flicked his finger, and a fireball flew out, exploding on the ground and instantly incinerating countless maggots. But immediately, more maggots swarmed forward. Seeing this, Lu Xu couldn't be bothered anymore. There were simply too many bugs on the ground, so dense that there was nowhere to step. After the person self-detonated, Lu Xu noticed over a dozen sparkling spirit stones and a dim small sword on the ground. Lu Xu used his Object Manipulation Art to pull the spirit stones and the low-grade magic artifact towards him.

He used a Fireball spell to unleash a large blaze, burning them once before putting them away.

"What do we do now? There are probably many cultivators in the market who've fallen victim, and there are still many mortals on the Mo family's side. Most of them are probably controlled by this demonic secret art!" Old Xu walked over and said.

"Let's hide first. This isn't a battle we can get involved in. Let's see how the Mo family's Old Ancestor reacts!" Lu Xu sighed.

The second-grade grand array guarding the market had not been breached and still prevented the Black Robe Society members from entering. This sudden turn of events was merely the opponent using a strange secret art to infiltrate the grand array, attempting to cause internal chaos. Now, it seemed the Black Robe Society had perfectly achieved its goal.

"Why must you press so hard, esteemed guest? Do you truly think my Mo family is easy to bully?"

An ancient voice resonated in the darkness, immediately followed by a crimson flame rising slowly from the Mo family's ancestral grounds. The flame soared into the sky, instantly illuminating the entire market. It continued to ascend, growing larger and larger, emitting increasingly intense light, like a blazing sun. The flame finally merged into the black water curtain, and a strange scene unfolded. Water and fire, originally completely opposing elements, now harmoniously converged. The flame rapidly spread within the water curtain. All the pitch-black hues along its path were devoured. In just over ten breaths, the sky transformed into a vast curtain of flames. This scene was incredibly shocking, yet it also made one marvel at the power of Foundation Establishment cultivators! The vastness of their spiritual power was simply unimaginable.

The flame quickly receded, shrinking back to its original fist-sized form and flying back to the Mo family's ancestral grounds. The layer of water curtain in the sky became clear once more, and sunlight streamed in again. Everything seemed to return to normal. However, the chaos in the market continued. The black maggots on the ground hadn't disappeared, and the mortals and cultivators controlled by the bugs were still wildly self-detonating and attacking everywhere. Lu Xu noticed that the layer of water curtain in the sky had visibly thinned and its emitted light was no longer as intense as before. It gave off a feeling of "weakness."

"It seems this grand array has suffered a heavy blow from that last attack!" Lu Xu thought to himself.

The leader of the Black Robe Society still stood above the market. After hearing the Mo family's Old Ancestor's words, his mouth opened and closed for a while, seemingly saying something. But his voice didn't carry through; the Mo family's Old Ancestor had used the array to block it. At this moment, a resonant voice sounded from within the Mo family's ancestral grounds:

"Everyone, with our Old Ancestor presiding, this array is as solid as a fortress. The market will be fine. Please calm down and do not move recklessly. Our Mo family cultivators will eliminate the controlled cultivators within the market, restoring peace to everyone!"

Upon hearing this, many cultivators who had just been panicking calmed down. However, many others became even more wary; they had already seen through the Mo family's facade of strength. Why wouldn't the Mo family's Old Ancestor allow the Black Robe Society leader's voice to enter? He must be afraid of something; his physical condition is likely failing, isn't it? Chaos was about to descend!

The Black Robe Society's actions were swift! While the Mo family hadn't even quelled the chaos within their own ancestral grounds, the Black Robe Society leader in the sky struck again! A large banner, as tall as a man, appeared in his hand. Its surface was emblazoned with the heads of malevolent spirits, and as a gentle breeze swept past, the banner fluttered loudly.

"Thousand Soul Banner!"

Upon seeing that magic artifact, someone in the market let out a cry of alarm. Everyone's heart tightened upon hearing this. Soul banners were a common type of magic artifact among demonic cultivators, with many grades like Ten-Soul, Hundred-Soul, Thousand-Soul, and Myriad-Soul. The more souls contained within, the greater the power of the artifact. And for the same number of souls, the more cultivator souls were present, the more terrifying the artifact became! A Thousand Soul Banner refined entirely from mortal souls could barely contend with mid to late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators. To be able to resist Foundation Establishment cultivators, it would need tens of thousands of souls. But—

Remembering the hundreds of cultivator corpses from earlier, everyone's heart sank. It was likely that all those people's souls had been captured into this banner, right? Hundreds of cultivator souls—the power of this Thousand Soul Banner had definitely reached the Foundation Establishment level! Moreover, there were tens of thousands of mortals in the town outside the market. If the Black Robe Society slaughtered all of them to refine a Hundred Thousand Soul Banner... Then Qinghu Market would have no chance of survival! On the surface, Wei Nation and even the entire Nine Eastern Desolation Nations strictly forbade the indiscriminate slaughter of mortals and vigilantly guarded against demonic forces. Within the Nine Nations, news of such large-scale slaughter of mortals to refine demonic artifacts was rarely heard. Once someone did so, they would immediately become a public enemy, reviled by all.

Of course, this was only the public stance. In private, small-scale killings of mortals were quite common and could not be completely prohibited. The demonic artifacts Lu Xu had seen previously in Madam Wu's shop certainly didn't come from thin air. As a force of rogue cultivators, the Black Robe Society naturally stood against order.

If they truly did such a thing, it wouldn't be particularly shocking news. Therefore, Lu Xu vaguely felt that if they couldn't breach the market's array in a short time, the Black Robe Society might indeed resort to blood-sacrificing the tens of thousands of mortals outside!

"Get ready to run, I think this array is about to break!" Lu Xu said to Old Xu. Old Xu nodded gravely; he shared the same view.

The Black Robe Society leader waved the Thousand Soul Banner, and instantly, streams of black qi shot out from its surface, covering the sky and earth. Within the black qi, a dense mass of faces appeared, crying, cursing, pleading, and threatening through gritted teeth... The Black Robe Society leader seemed to hear nothing, his lips moving slightly, seemingly chanting something. Driven by the incantation, the souls began to coalesce. Their faces gradually twisted, and their voices slowly died down, eventually becoming inaudible.

"Roar!"

A beast-like roar suddenly erupted. Amidst the surging black qi, a malevolent spirit appeared, with two horns on its head, blood-red eyes, a mouth split to its ears, and terrifyingly sharp, bone-white teeth. This was a monster formed by the aggregation of a thousand souls, its brass-bell-like eyes drifting in the black qi. The malevolent spirit had eight arms, each wielding a different weapon. Blades, forks, spears, hammers... The blade seemed to be ground from human bone, the fork impaled a red, steaming, still-beating heart, and the hammer was formed by combining numerous human skulls.

"Boom!"

The malevolent spirit wielded its eight weapons, smashing them towards the grand array. Its body emanated a Foundation Establishment aura, immensely powerful. The Black Robe Society leader also moved, a small azure sword appearing in his hand, which he fiercely slashed down towards the water curtain. The Black Robe Society members surrounding the outside also took action, bombarding the array. The array soon began to shake violently.

"Act! Quickly, stop those people!"

The Mo family head's roar echoed throughout the market, but the response was sparse. The market was now in complete chaos; those controlled by maggots were running rampant, attacking everyone. Who would have time to worry about the situation outside? What's more, many cultivators secretly wished for this grand array to be breached! The Mo family's Old Ancestor was now fully focused on controlling the array and couldn't act personally. Only a few Mo family cultivators sent out their magic artifacts, flying beyond the water curtain to engage in fierce battle with the Black Robe Society cultivators. But this was merely a drop in the bucket. Under the Black Robe Society's assault, the layer of water curtain in the sky shook more and more violently, eventually becoming almost on the verge of collapse!

Half an hour later.

With a "Boom!", the second-grade Azure Water Surging Array was broken, and the entire market was exposed before the Black Robe Society.
