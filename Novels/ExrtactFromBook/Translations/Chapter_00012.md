# Chapter 12: Earnings

This was Han Yue's first time witnessing a cultivator's battle up close.

His horizons were instantly broadened!

No wonder just a hundred thousand human cultivators could hold back the invasion of countless colossal beasts, even hunting demonic creatures as resources.

Bloodline cultivators armed to the teeth with various equipment truly possessed formidable combat strength.

Not only were they immensely powerful with explosive speed, but they also wielded rich combat techniques.

Han Yue assessed himself—without using his divine abilities, he stood no chance against Fang Yi!

Fang Yi approached Han Yue, removing her helmet as she spoke:

"So Han Yue, how was that? Impressive, right?"

"Since my second year of Qi absorption, I've never failed a single hunt!"

"No beast below the second rank can stand against me!"

Han Yue praised sincerely: "The squad leader is truly formidable! Watching you got my blood pumping!"

"Squad leader, before we head back, take me to see my target too. I'm itching to try my hand!"

"Hahaha, of course, no problem!"

The team's energy had ignited Han Yue's own battle spirit.

This was the perfect opportunity to test his own strength.

By now, the Steel Ghost Ox lay collapsed on the ground, barely clinging to life.

A team member produced a flask-shaped magical tool, pressing it against the ox's wound to collect every drop of spurting blood.

Once the Steel Ghost Ox breathed its last, Fang Yi took out a pouch-shaped artifact and stored the entire carcass inside.

With that, the hunt was officially complete.

The entire team returned to camp where a prepared meal awaited.

Fang Yi washed off the blood at the lakeside before joining the feast.

Between bites, she explained the economics of hunting to Han Yue:

"A first-rank beast sold whole—hide and meat intact—to a merchant house fetches about 250 to 300 trade points."

"But if we butcher it ourselves, the remaining parts won't exceed 200 points."

"Our Squad Nine averages four or five hunts a year, totaling about 1,000 points annually."

"Daily cultivation needs are covered by the free demon beast meat. Other earnings usually go toward equipment upgrades or magical tools."

"This corpse-storing pouch I'm using? Holds three monster carcasses, preserves them for three years without decay. The merchant house sells it for over 2,000 trade points."

"Took our squad years of savings to afford it."

Han Yue asked curiously:

"Your hunt seemed effortless. Why not take more prey to increase earnings?"

Fang Yi replied:

"First-rank beasts are easy pickings!"

"If the forest only had first-ranks, we'd have hunted them to extinction long ago!"

"But encounter a second-rank beast? That's when we start losing people."

"We see beasts as resources, but to them, human cultivators are rare delicacies too."

"More people lingering longer in the forest creates stronger energy traces—more likely to attract second-rank predators."

"If not for this, I'd live here permanently, hunting nonstop!"

Her mood darkened momentarily as memories surfaced, and she fell silent.

Han Yue quietly finished his meal while mentally preparing for his own hunt.

The team rested overnight by the lake, recovering their stamina and letting the draft horses recuperate.

Han Yue continued condensing runes and accumulating mana—making daily progress!

By dawn, Fang Yi had regained her usual energetic demeanor, loudly directing the packing.

Soon the caravan set out toward Han Yue's hunting target.

Han Yue realized how a professional team optimized the hunt—whether tracking prey or managing logistics, their support proved invaluable.

After half a day's travel covering another 500 kilometers, they located the Bronze-horned Ram.

The massive yellow-furred beast with metallic horns stood leisurely in the forest, vigorously rubbing its horns against a kilometer-tall giant fir.

Spotting the ram from afar, Han Yue's group halted the caravan and advanced cautiously.

Han Yue gripped his [Geng Gold Blade Embryo], controlling his breath as he crept toward the prey.

Fang Yi followed in full armor, scythe and tower shield ready to assist.

Months had passed since Han Yue's first battle in Demon City—he was no longer the same person.

His physical enhancements, mana reserves, and divine ability mastery had all progressed tremendously!

Unlike Fang Yi's explosive approach, Han Yue silently closed within 300 meters before the ram noticed.

The beast instantly adopted a defensive stance.

Han Yue didn't activate [Thoughtless Slash], merely channeling accumulated lightning energy into the blade.

He precisely controlled the mana output, maintaining tension without release.

Han Yue struck!

A golden flash—he vanished.

Reappearing directly above the ram's skull, his blade descended.

The edge parted the creature's metal-like hide like soft tofu, shattering its bloodline defenses.

Lightning erupted from the embedded blade, instantly piercing through the ram's brain.

Another golden flash—blade and wielder returned to their original position, the weapon spotless.

Only the ram's twitching body remained.

The entire sequence lasted less than a second.

The hunt was over.

The Bronze-horned Ram collapsed lifeless.

A stunned silence gripped the spectators before erupting into cheers.

"Incredible!"

"Blade Brother's too strong!"

First-time witnesses stood awestruck.

Where Fang Yi's style was explosive, domineering, overwhelming—

Han Yue's was efficient, cold, and terrifying.

Two completely different approaches—one an ironclad shield warrior, the other a lethal assassin.

But both belonged to Squad Nine! The team celebrated gaining another hunting master.

Fang Yi especially stomped and clapped excitedly.

Meanwhile, Han Yue retreated inward, analyzing the battle.

He'd precisely controlled his mana expenditure.

The several-hundred-meter round trip consumed negligible energy from [Earth-Traversing Golden Light Technique].

The lightning expenditure didn't even tap into [Thoughtless Slash]'s reserves—utterly insignificant.

In other words, this battle hadn't remotely tested Han Yue's limits!
