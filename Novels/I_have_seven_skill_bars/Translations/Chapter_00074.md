# Chapter 74: Deep Pit

Seeing Jiang She's reaction, Dongfeng finally felt a bit more confident. Since he had promised Ding Rui this, he had to try his best to accomplish it. He didn't want to be outdone in this aspect either.

After thinking for a moment, Dongfeng continued, "Moreover, Junior Brother himself planted Spirit Channel Flowers in advance and has some experience. I've observed them; the Spirit Channel Flowers he planted have been growing for nearly a month, and their growth is excellent. So, at least before the rapid growth period of the Spirit Channel Flowers, he'll have no problem managing them. Furthermore, the Spirit Channel Flowers he planted can perfectly serve as test subjects. After all, they were planted a month in advance and are now approaching their rapid growth period, while the sect's Spirit Channel Flowers haven't even been planted yet. Even if he encounters any issues then, we'll have ample time to make adjustments! It won't affect the sect's Spirit Channel Flower cultivation!"

Dongfeng spoke very earnestly. Jiang She listened intently.

Silence filled the room for a moment. When Dongfeng secretly glanced up at Jiang She, Jiang She slammed his hand on the table and said, "Alright! We'll do as you say?"

Dongfeng was startled and blurted out, "Senior Brother, you're agreeing just like that?"

Jiang She glanced at him, shaking his head. "There's no choice. Currently, the sect's Spirit Field cultivators are severely understaffed, and cultivating Spirit Channel Flowers is too difficult, making it extremely hard to get started. We also have to allocate some Spirit Field cultivators to continue planting Spirit Rice, as Spirit Rice is the only source of resources within the domain. No matter what, we can't completely abandon it."

Fortunately, Ding Rui had long since comprehended the [Loosen Soil] skill, and the habitual memory of fusing [Loosen Soil] with [Insecticide] was constantly deepening. And this way, he wouldn't need to use his feet anymore. Previously, he had to hold the Earth Qi Hoe with his foot because both his hands were busy and couldn't grasp it. But now that he no longer needed to hold the Earth Qi Hoe, he could channel his *Earth Qi Art* true essence into the soil through the hand he used for weeding, as weeds were closer to the ground.

Sitting in the spirit field, Ding Rui completed the full sequence for the last sect-planted Spirit Channel Flower, then shifted his gaze to the patch of Spirit Channel Flowers he had planted himself. Five days had passed since Dongfeng and Shuimen last visited Spirit Field 520. And the Spirit Channel Flowers he had planted earlier had finally reached their rapid growth period. The Spirit Channel Flowers would now grow at an incredibly fast pace, rooting deeply to absorb nutrients and spiritual energy for future flowering and fruiting.

Dongfeng had kept his promise and successfully secured Ding Rui the qualification to cultivate Spirit Channel Flowers independently. This made Ding Rui very happy. However, he knew that he had to prove his ability to stably guide the Spirit Channel Flowers through their rapid growth period before the sect-planted ones entered that phase.

Only after a full ten attempts did he reach the optimal depth mentioned in the guidelines: two *chi*! Ding Rui savored the feeling and the time taken for a moment, then moved to the next plant. On the next plant, Ding Rui didn't directly use the [Loosen Soil] skill. Instead, he used another skill—a skill he had painstakingly worked on for a long time, only barely managing to condense it today, and one he had not yet tested.

[Deep Pit]

Ding Rui placed his hand on the soil at the base of this Spirit Channel Flower, then activated the skill. A torrent of true essence, even more turbulent and vast than that of the [Loosen Soil] skill, flowed from his acupoints, traveled through his meridians to his hand, and then plunged directly into the soil beneath his palm. This was almost half of his *Earth Qi Art* true essence. Naturally, a greater volume of true essence brought about a stronger effect.

A thread of extremely fine true essence pierced straight down, penetrating from the soil surface to a depth of two *chi* in one go, its start and end connected. More true essence remained above, but as the bottom true essence solidified, it slowly permeated downwards along the initial thread, evenly and steadily, spreading apart the solid soil, breaking up hard clods, and leaving fissures through which the Spirit Channel Flower's roots could easily extend.
