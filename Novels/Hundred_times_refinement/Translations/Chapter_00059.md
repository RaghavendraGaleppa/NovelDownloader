Chapter 9: Plundering Treasures

Lin Xuan was overjoyed as he sorted through his spoils of war. Although his senior sister had been ruthless, she had been wealthy. From her storage jade bracelet, Lin Xuan retrieved six low-grade spirit stones, two magical tools, and a jade bottle. Upon opening the bottle, a fragrant aroma wafted out, revealing two snow-white marrow-washing pills inside. In addition, he found several talismans.

Talismans were a type of sealed spell that cultivators could use in battle without expending their spiritual energy, allowing for instant activation. However, creating talismans was a complex process that required special paper and a significant amount of spiritual energy, with a low success rate. The higher the level of the spell, the more difficult it was to create, making talismans a rare and precious commodity in the cultivation world.

Lin Xuan counted a total of seven talismans, each containing different elemental spells, including metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The most precious items among his spoils, however, were the two magical tools. Even for a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage, magical tools were highly valuable. Zhou Yan, a cultivator at the Spirit Motion stage, had possessed two such tools. One was the Golden Rope she had used to kill her master, which could shrink to a length of about a foot but could extend to any length when infused with spiritual energy, used for binding enemies.

The other was a flying sword, an offensive magical tool. Lin Xuan was enamored with it, playing with it lovingly. Both were high-grade magical tools, extremely precious. Unfortunately, Lin Xuan's cultivation level was too low; he would need to practice the Spirit Motion stage technique to the fourth layer to be able to wield these magical tools effectively.

Lin Xuan put all the items back into the storage jade bracelet. Although the experience had been perilous, the gains were substantial. Moreover, there was another person's wealth waiting to be claimed. Zhang Yu, being a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator, was likely to have an even more substantial collection.

Just as Lin Xuan was about to leave, he noticed that Zhou Yan's left hand was still clenched around a sandalwood box, even in death. It was for the contents of this box that she had rebelled against and killed her master. Lin Xuan's curiosity was piqued as to what could be inside.

After some hesitation, Lin Xuan carefully removed the box from Zhou Yan's hand and examined it before placing it on the ground. He then retreated about seven or eight steps.

Using a twig, Lin Xuan carefully opened the box. Suddenly, several small arrows shot out, their speed astonishing. If one were unprepared, even a skilled cultivator would find it difficult to dodge.

The arrows struck a nearby tree, causing it to wither immediately. The arrows were coated with a potent poison. Lin Xuan, however, remained calm, his expression unchanged.

After waiting for a while to ensure there were no more dangers, Lin Xuan cautiously picked up the box. Inside, he found a fist-sized shell. The shell was colorful, with strange patterns on its surface, clearly not an ordinary item.

Lin Xuan examined the shell carefully. After a moment, his hesitant gaze turned determined. He used a bit of force to open the shell, revealing its secret.

Inside, instead of a pearl, there were blue, glowing particles swirling like a starry sky. Lin Xuan was unsure what they were but was drawn to their beauty. As he hesitated, the particles began to rotate faster and faster, then flew towards him. Before he could react, they merged into his body.

Intense pain coursed through every inch of Lin Xuan's body, as if his skin was being torn apart. He fell to the ground, his consciousness fading. The shell, now devoid of the blue particles, rapidly petrified and then disintegrated into sand, dispersing in the wind. The valley was left as if nothing had happened, except for the unconscious youth.

At dawn, Lin Xuan regained consciousness, the warm sunlight illuminating the ground. He had lost a day and a night. The unbearable pain had vanished, but he didn't feel refreshed, having spent a night outdoors.

After checking his body and finding no abnormalities, Lin Xuan made his way to Zhou Yan's corpse. Suppressing his disgust, he threw her into a pit. He then went to where Zhang Yu had been ambushed, collecting his belongings, which included a storage belt. Lin Xuan didn't have time to examine the contents; his priority was to leave that place.

Lin Xuan threw Zhang Yu's corpse into the pit as well, burying both bodies. He carefully erased any traces of their presence, ensuring that the valley, already rarely visited, would remain a secret burial ground.

Without further delay, Lin Xuan returned to Floating Cloud Valley. Despite the thrilling experience, he appeared normal, as if nothing had happened. Even when greeted or ridiculed by others on the way, Lin Xuan responded as usual, his demeanor unchanged.

Upon returning to his residence, Lin Xuan's first task was to secure his door and windows. He then examined the storage belt taken from Zhang Yu, beginning to inventory its contents.
