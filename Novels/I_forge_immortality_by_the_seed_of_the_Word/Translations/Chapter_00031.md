# Chapter 31: The Change in Master Zhang and Arrival at Luodu Island

The sound of footsteps echoed through the night.

Zhang Jing walked step by step along the bluestone-paved street, drawing closer to the medicine shop. Though he had only been away for a month, the familiar surroundings now gave him a sense of how much had changed in such a short time.

Before he knew it, he had arrived at the shop's door.

Knock knock! He rapped lightly.

The sound of hurried footsteps came from inside before the door slowly opened, revealing two familiar figures.

"Father, Mother, Jing'er has returned," Zhang Jing said with a smile.

For a moment, both parents stood frozen in place.

After a long pause, Zhang's father finally spoke, his voice trembling slightly despite his attempt to remain composed: "Jing'er is back! Come inside, come inside quickly."

"Jing'er, were you hurt at the Dao Academy? Did you eat properly? Did you have any conflicts with others?" Zhang's mother asked tearfully as she grasped her son's hands.

"Mother, I'm fine. Everything at the academy has been good," Zhang Jing reassured them as the three moved inside.

Late into the night, the Zhang Family Medicine Shop remained brightly lit.

"Father, Mother, you're saying these were gifts from the 'Ji Family Head'?" Zhang Jing pointed at the boxes hidden beneath the bed, clearly surprised.

The Ji family's intelligence network was remarkably efficient! He had only placed third in the academy's assessment that very day, yet by evening they'd already sent these gifts to his parents. Could this be... Brother Ji's doing?

"Yes, Jing'er. Last night Scholar Liu came to tell us you'd passed the academy assessment and become an immortal. The Ji family head came with him," Zhang's father explained.

Meanwhile, Zhang's mother looked at her son with concern: "Jing'er, perhaps we should return these? They've sent such extravagant gifts right after you entered the immortal path—they must want something. Don't let this affect your cultivation. Your father and I don't need wealth or status—we only want what's best for you."

Zhang Jing chuckled softly. "Father, Mother, you can accept these gifts with peace of mind. The Ji family is merely showing goodwill—it's nothing to worry about." After brief consideration, he understood the Ji family's intentions and was pleased with the situation.

"By the way, Father, Mother—where is this residence they mentioned located?"

"On East Street, right next to Yong'an Academy," Zhang's father answered after checking the deed.

"The Ji family has been quite thoughtful," Zhang Jing nodded approvingly.

This arrangement was perfect. With his academy commitments keeping him away, having his parents live near Yong'an Academy ensured their safety. If demons ever appeared in Yong'an City, Scholar Liu would surely intervene, buying time until Ji family cultivators could arrive.

"Father, Mother, we'll move there in the next couple days. I'll feel much better knowing you're living there," Zhang Jing said firmly, his tone brooking no argument. Though Zhang's mother seemed to want to say more, she could only nod in agreement.

"We'll follow Jing'er's wishes."

The next morning, shortly after dawn, Ji Xianming seemed to have received word and hurried to the medicine shop. Spotting a young figure inside, his face broke into a warm smile.

"Might this be Nephew Zhang?" he called out amiably.

Zhang Jing turned in surprise. "And you are...?"

The man approached the shop entrance enthusiastically. "Does Nephew recall Ji Bochang? That's my unworthy son."

"Brother Ji?" Realization dawned on Zhang Jing, who smiled. "So it's Uncle Ji! I'm undeserving of your generous gifts—Brother Ji has already helped me greatly at the academy. Please, come in."

"Nephew flatters me. Between fellow cultivators, such worldly possessions are hardly worth mentioning. They're just small comforts for your esteemed parents," Ji Xianming replied as Zhang Jing ushered him inside.

Just then, Zhang's mother emerged from the inner rooms. Seeing Ji Xianming, her expression became somewhat stiff. "Master Ji—"

Ji Xianming's face changed instantly. "Sister-in-law, though I'm slightly older than you and your husband, 'Brother Ji' will suffice. The title 'Master' is far too grand for me."

"Brother Ji, please have a seat. I'll prepare tea," Zhang's mother said awkwardly.

"Many thanks, sister-in-law," Ji Xianming replied courteously as he sat.

After a brief interval, Ji Xianming took a sip of tea and came straight to the point: "Nephew Zhang, I came today first to congratulate you on your return, and second to discuss the matter of the Hundred Herbs Pavilion."

"The Hundred Herbs Pavilion? What about them?" Zhang Jing asked, puzzled.

Ji Xianming glanced curiously at Zhang's parents. "Have you not told Nephew Zhang about this matter?"

Zhang's father shook his head with a wry smile. "Brother Ji, we didn't want it affecting Jing'er's assessment, so we kept it quiet. And after you helped resolve the situation, there seemed no need to worry him."

"Father, Mother, what exactly happened?" Zhang Jing pressed, his eyes flashing coldly.

Seeing the parents' reluctance, Ji Xianming explained the entire situation from beginning to end.

"I see. Thank you for your assistance, Uncle," Zhang Jing expressed his gratitude before adding calmly, "So the Hundred Herbs Pavilion has a rogue cultivator backing them? That could lead to future trouble."

Though Zhang Jing's tone remained even, Ji Xianming inexplicably felt a chill run down his spine. Truly worthy of placing third in the fiercely competitive academy assessment, surpassed only by two supreme prodigies! The young man's aura was terrifying.

Remembering his son Ji Bochang's warning in their communication talisman, Ji Xianming marveled privately while also feeling perplexed. How had a child from an ordinary family reached such heights? Had their ancestral graves erupted with good fortune? If he hurried home to... rearrange his own family's burial grounds and have another child, would there still be time?

Snapping back to the present, Ji Xianming quickly reassured: "Don't concern yourself, Nephew. Yesterday I had people... thoroughly handle both the Hundred Herbs Pavilion owner and that rogue cultivator. There will be no lingering issues."

Zhang Jing's face broke into a smile. "Uncle's consideration is most thorough. I appreciate your efforts."

"Haha, it's nothing. Our Ji family is known for seeing things through completely. Also, rest assured—I've arranged for two clan uncles at the fifth level of Qi Refinement to reside in the eastern district. Even if demons appear, they'll ensure your parents' safety."

Finishing his tea in one gulp, Ji Xianming rose to leave: "With matters settled here, this uncle must be going now."

"Take care, Uncle. I'll look after Brother Ji at the academy," Zhang Jing called after him.

"Excellent! Nephew is most kind, hahaha!" Ji Xianming departed in high spirits, delighted by Zhang Jing's promise.

Behind him, Zhang's father asked in astonishment: "Jing'er, the Hundred Herbs Pavilion owner and that immortal... are they dead?" His mouth hung open as if ready to catch ten eggs.

Zhang Jing nodded slowly. The parents exchanged stunned looks, unable to comprehend how a revered immortal could perish so easily—all because the Ji family sought to curry favor with their son. Gazing at the boy they'd raised, they suddenly felt an unfamiliar distance between them.

Zhang Jing remained at home for over ten days, not departing for the academy until after the Chang'an Festival. During this time, he helped his parents move, purchased dozens of servants, and enlisted the Ji family's help in finding a reliable steward.

In those short weeks, Apothecary Zhang became Master Zhang, and his wife became Madam Zhang. A steady stream of visitors arrived from county offices, commanderies, prefectures, and prominent families. Rumors spread through the streets: "Apothecary Zhang was blessed with an immortal son—showered with celestial favor, rising overnight to nobility!"

In the Zhang residence's inner hall, Zhang's mother murmured before several spirit tablets she'd prepared:

"Father, Mother, Elder Brother... Are you well in the afterlife? I bring good news—Jing'er, your grandson and nephew, has become an immortal of the Dao Academy. Who could have imagined our Li family's generations-long aspiration would be fulfilled through Jing'er..."

Zhang's father entered quietly in his brocade robes. "Thinking of them again, my wife?"

"Dear husband, Jing'er has entered the immortal path. There's now a gulf between us," Zhang's mother said emptily.

"Shall we try for another?"

"You incorrigible old man!"

Before the Dao Academy's Inheritance Pavilion, a travel-worn Zhang Jing retrieved a communication talisman from his spirit jade space and channeled spiritual energy into it.

"Nephew Zhang, back so soon? Wait briefly—this senior brother will come fetch you shortly," Zhang Yangchu's voice transmitted through the talisman.

Storing the talisman, Zhang Jing stood quietly with closed eyes, awaiting Senior Brother Yangchu's arrival. The journey from home to Dragon Lake Dao Academy had taken ten full days—even with constant use of movement techniques. Remembering how the spirit crane had made the trip in half a day, Zhang Jing resolved to acquire both a flying artifact and a flying mount when possible.

Before long, a streak of light approached as Yangchu arrived astride a door-sized flying sword, stopping gracefully before Zhang Jing.

"Apologies for the wait, Junior Brother!"

"Not at all—Senior Brother came remarkably fast," Zhang Jing smiled.

"Naturally! When I heard you'd returned, I came at full speed without hesitation. Come aboard!"

"Yes, Senior Brother." Zhang Jing leapt lightly onto the sword behind Yangchu.

"Hold tight, Junior Brother." As Zhang Jing grasped his senior's robes, the phrase struck him as oddly familiar.

With a roar, the sword rose and shot forward like a comet. Below them flashed numerous lake islands of varying sizes, each dotted with continuous structures.

"Junior Brother, those below are the outposts of other mission teams. Each island represents one squad."

"So many?" Zhang Jing marveled.

Yangchu nodded. "Indeed. Dragon Lake Dao Academy has existed for countless years. New teams form annually while others perish against demons. Over time, this is the result."

"I see." Awe flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. He couldn't fathom how many powerful cultivators these teams concealed—nor how formidable Luodu Squad must be to consistently rank among the top three.

Clearly, he'd been misled by the term "squad's" modest connotations.

After flying an indeterminable distance, an enormous island gradually appeared on the horizon, its grandeur evident in countless pavilions and towers. Dozens of formidable auras resonated across the island—some sharp, some gentle, some violent.

"Junior Brother... we're home."
