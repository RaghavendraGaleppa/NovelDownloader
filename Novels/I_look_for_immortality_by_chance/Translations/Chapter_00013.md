# Chapter 13: Putting on Airs is the Winning Strategy

Qiu Mingshan felt genuinely helpless.

He had originally planned to present Gu Yuan with an opportunity, thereby establishing a favorable connection. After all, this was a gesture that cost him nothing yet yielded benefits. 

Gu Yuan had been recommended for admission by a Golden Core Elder, after all. Maintaining this connection would undoubtedly be advantageous. 

However, to his surprise, just recently, someone from the Lan family had approached him, seeking a quota to select a cave dwelling. They had received reliable information that one of the caves contained "Azure Crane Spirit Water."

Azure Crane Spirit Water was a rare spiritual treasure crucial for breaking through from the fourth to the fifth level of Qi Refinement—specifically for the spiritual awareness barrier. 

In this world of cultivation, wealth, companionship, methods, and land were the four pillars, with wealth ranked first for good reason. 

Better resources meant a stronger foundation. 

For instance, when breaking through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement, an ordinary cultivator's spiritual awareness could only extend about three zhang (approximately ten meters), functioning like an invisible eye with no other remarkable abilities. 

But with the aid of Azure Crane Spirit Water, the resulting spiritual awareness would be as agile as a soaring crane—not only incredibly flexible, capable of roaming up to five zhang, but also exceptionally fierce, able to tear and peck at the spiritual awareness of peers. 

This unique spiritual awareness alone could provide a threefold advantage in combat. 

It was far superior to "Heavenly Silver Water," which merely assisted in breaking through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement. 

Back when Qiu Mingshan himself had broken through to the fifth level, he had only obtained a small portion of "Lesser Heaven Spirit Water," which expanded his spiritual awareness by five zhang but offered no combat enhancement. 

Yet, who would have thought that such a treasure would be found in this modest Qi Refinement cave dwelling? 

Where had it even come from? 

Faced with Qiu Mingshan's inquiry, Lan Yunlu narrowed his eyes slightly and bowed his head in response. "Senior Brother, the Tang brothers were of one mind. When the three of them joined forces, their combat prowess surpassed that of ordinary fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivators. That's how they managed to break into a minor secret realm while still at the fourth level and obtain this treasure."

"However, precisely because they obtained it, the three brothers were eager to take on missions to earn spirit stones, hoping to reach the late stage of the fourth level quickly and break through to the fifth level to consume this treasure."

"Fearing that others might covet it and ambush them to seize it, they didn't carry it with them. Yet, despite their caution, they still met with misfortune—all three perished."

"Very few know of this matter. I only learned of it recently by chance, which is why I've come to seek your assistance."

"As for the rumored 'Heavenly Silver Water,' it was merely a smokescreen."

Qiu Mingshan finally understood. However, he had his own difficulties and thus declined, saying, "Though Azure Crane Spirit Water is precious, given your family's resources, you should still be able to obtain it elsewhere, shouldn't you?"

---

Though the Lan family was influential, compared to the goodwill of a Golden Core Elder, they still fell short. 

Qiu Mingshan's preference still leaned toward Gu Yuan. 

But to avoid offending the Lan family, he added, "How about this? I'll allow you to be the second to choose among the three cave dwellings. Let fate decide. If the first selector doesn't pick the one you desire, you may then make your choice. What do you say?"

Hearing this, Lan Tianlu shook his head with a bitter smile. "Senior Brother, under normal circumstances, my family could indeed procure another spirit water for me. After all, while spirit waters for Qi Refinement are rare, they aren't impossible to find—with enough spirit stones, one can always acquire them."

"But major events are about to unfold in the East Sea, and the same goes for the Heavenly Palace. According to my uncle, the Dao Academy may soon initiate the selection for the Ten Great Dao Disciples. This is my opportunity, and I cannot afford to wait."

"The selection for the Ten Great Dao Disciples? Doesn't that mean a campaign of conquest is imminent?" 

Qiu Mingshan was startled—he clearly hadn't received this news yet. 

"Indeed, an era of great contention approaches. I must enhance my cultivation as quickly as possible!"

"Senior Brother, I beg for your assistance!"

Lan Tianlu nodded emphatically and, with a seemingly casual gesture, handed Qiu Mingshan a storage pouch. 

Qiu Mingshan didn't accept it outright, but his curiosity got the better of him, and he sent a strand of spiritual awareness to probe its contents. 

"Thirty spirit stones, a Qi Gathering Pill, and a Small Vermilion Fruit!"

"The value of this pouch nearly surpasses that of the Azure Crane Spirit Water itself!"

Though Qiu Mingshan had expected the Lan family's offer to be generous, he was still shocked by the contents of the pouch. 

After all, an ordinary fourth-level Qi Refinement disciple, even if they scrimped and saved while tirelessly completing missions, would only earn about fifty spirit stones in a year. 

In reality, no disciple could solely accumulate without spending—daily cultivation, purchasing magical tools and pills, and comprehending techniques all required substantial expenditures. 

An average cultivator would be fortunate to save twenty spirit stones in a year. 

Yet the value of this storage pouch, if converted to spirit stones, amounted to nearly two hundred. 

Even in the marketplace, that would almost be enough to buy a portion of Azure Crane Spirit Water. 

Though he had favored Gu Yuan earlier, the benefits he had offered amounted to only a few dozen spirit stones—nowhere near the resources in this pouch. 

This was why ordinary disciples without backing or family support could never afford spirit waters for breakthroughs. 

Even with his ninth-level Qi Refinement cultivation, Qiu Mingshan's annual savings only amounted to a little over two hundred spirit stones. 

This left him deeply conflicted. 

On one side was the potential goodwill of a Golden Core Elder; on the other was tangible wealth. 

The choice was agonizing. 

Lan Tianlu seemed to sense his hesitation and pressed further, "Does Senior Brother have some difficulty? Please speak frankly—perhaps my Lan family can be of assistance?"

---

Lan Tianlu was growing anxious. He had thought this matter would be easily resolved, never expecting such complications. 

The treasure in that cave dwelling was something he had long planned for—it was absolutely essential. 

It represented a tremendous opportunity! 

For that, spending a little extra was worth it. 

Casually, Lan Tianlu produced another storage pouch. 

Qiu Mingshan's gaze lingered on it briefly. Just as he was about to speak, a jade-scaled dragon soared through the sky, carrying a tall, handsome young man who stood confidently atop it. 

Though the young man's cultivation wasn't particularly high, he exuded an air of self-assurance. Even when facing Qiu Mingshan, a ninth-level Qi Refinement cultivator, he showed no trace of fear, descending gracefully to land beside him. 

"Senior Brother Qiu!" 

The young man was, of course, Gu Yuan. 

He had awoken early that day but hadn't set out immediately. Instead, he had waited in his courtyard, practicing his demeanor repeatedly before riding the dragon over. 

Poise and presence were key to securing the cave dwelling today. 

His hair was tied back with a green jade hairpin, his features refined and striking. His tall frame seemed to blend with the daylight, and the green Daoist robe he wore made him resemble a noble scholar, yet with the transcendent aura of a Daoist—both elegant and aloof, an indescribably perfect bearing. 

Above all, he radiated confidence, as if his inner strength was formidable, exuding a compelling presence. 

"Junior Brother Gu, you've arrived!" 

"It's been a few days—your bearing is truly impressive!" 

Struck by Gu Yuan's demeanor, Qiu Mingshan hesitated, swallowing the words he had been about to say to Lan Tianlu. 

With such an appearance and not being formally taken in as a disciple... could it be that a Golden Core Elder had taken a liking to him? 

Recalling Elder Hu's background, Qiu Mingshan suddenly entertained an irreverent thought.
