## Chapter 119: So Pleasurable

Six black chains, adorned with intricate runes, intertwined. Dark array patterns emerged, forming a profound formation around the Amethyst Winged Tiger's body. Black mist swirled, and ghastly faces, along with what seemed like remnant souls and malevolent spirits, roared as they steadily eroded the tiger's physique.

Agonized roars echoed through the jungle as the Amethyst Winged Tiger's body was gradually consumed by the array, losing its former brilliance. Zhou Tian frowned. The time from the tiger's leap to now was incredibly short, indicating these individuals were clearly not doing this for the first time; their process was smoothly practiced.

The Amethyst Winged Tiger's fierce roars had subsided into low whimpers. Its amethyst-like body was eroded and turned pitch black. One of the six black-robed figures surrounding the tiger pulled a dark, seemingly spherical object from their robes. Before Zhou Tian could get a closer look, a sharp black spear, wreathed in black mist, cut through the air with an ear-piercing whoosh, heading straight for him. Zhou Tian's attention had been entirely drawn to the scene in the sky, so by the time he detected the attack, the black spear was less than a hundred meters away.

Upon seeing the incoming attack, Zhou Tian's expression became incredibly peculiar. He noticed that the spear's target was rather odd—not his head, nor his heart, but a certain point below his abdomen. This made Zhou Tian, who had originally intended to make a symbolic dodge, decide to show these insidious villains a taste of their own medicine.

The black spear struck Zhou Tian's unspeakable region with unstoppable force, then bizarrely vanished, leaving only a few curly hairs swaying in the wind. Zhou Tian took a deep breath and shouted with full vigor, "Despicable, shameless villains! Why did you ambush my little brother?!"

A moment later, in the utterly silent black jungle, a dense mass of black mist suddenly appeared, swirling over the ground covered in decaying branches and leaves. Any dry branches or leaves that came into contact with the black mist were obliterated. Finally, a figure entirely shrouded in a black robe emerged. This was not one of the six figures in the sky.

"Who are you?" an hoarse voice emanated from beneath the robe, making it impossible to discern if it was male or female. This person was, in truth, quite speechless. Their faction was carrying out its plans here, and then a naked man popped out of nowhere, peeping. As a well-known evil force, he couldn't help himself. He intended to let this naked man, who clearly didn't know his place, understand what true ruthlessness was, and thus he attacked.

"I am the Holy Emissary of Judgment from the Holy Divine Sect! And which obscure corner faction do you hail from?" Zhou Tian puffed out his chest, declaring with arrogant pride.

"..." The black-robed figure was speechless. *You're lying to ghosts! The Holy Emissary of Judgment from the Holy Divine Sect would look like you?* He glanced back at his companions. The ritual had reached its final stage, so there was no fear of interruption that might lead to failure. Too lazy to waste words with Zhou Tian, he extended a withered, branch-like hand. Chains rattled as a black chain stretched from his palm, glowing with an obsidian-like luster. Its tip penetrated the void like a darting snake, then shot out about three zhang (approx. 9 meters) from Zhou Tian. It coiled layer upon layer, and numerous tiny rune chains extended from the black chain, piercing the void to fill the surrounding space with traps, preventing Zhou Tian's escape.

The chains in the black-robed figure's hand seemed endless. Soon, the layers of chains encircling Zhou Tian were a person's height, forming a vertical chain cylinder that enveloped Zhou Tian. As the black-robed figure yanked hard, the chains burst into a clattering sound and began to contract. The black-robed figure cackled malevolently, as if he could already envision Zhou Tian's flesh and blood being squeezed into paste through the chain's gaps.

The chains contracted tightly. However, something unexpected happened to the black-robed figure: no red substance was squeezed out from between the chains. A faint breeze rustled the black-robed figure's hood. His pupils constricted, and from the corner of his eye, he saw two thick, hairy legs appear to his left. A dark gleam flashed, and a pitch-black long spear pierced directly into his ribs. Yet, only the spearhead entered his body, as chains appeared out of thin air to fix the black spear, preventing it from advancing an inch.

"If I had reacted any slower, I probably would have died. What a pity..." The black-robed figure pressed his skeletal, withered hand onto the black spear. Energy surged, runes swirled around it, and with a fierce clench, he forcibly shattered the black spear.

Zhou Tian's eyes narrowed, and he flashed away, creating distance. At this moment, the other black-robed figures from the sky also descended, positioning themselves at six points to surround Zhou Tian in the center. The Amethyst Winged Tiger had already vanished from the sky, its fate likely not good.

"Who is this person?"

"Why is he naked?"

"Just kill him."

"Agreed."

In a few words, they decided Zhou Tian's fate, without even giving him a chance to speak. Clatter! Seven chains arced through the air, and demonic patterns extended in the void, instantly forming an array—the same formation they had just used on the Amethyst Winged Tiger, now deployed on Zhou Tian.

Ethereal black threads emerged from the array and wrapped around Zhou Tian's body. Zhou Tian did not use his [Teleport] skill to leave. His target had been dealt with by them, so today's death count would have to fall upon these black-robed figures instead. The black threads burrowed into Zhou Tian's body like tree roots. Zhou Tian closed his eyes, carefully sensing them. As the black threads entered his body, he didn't feel much pain; instead, there was an inexplicable sense of comfort.

Streams of life force were drawn away. Zhou Tian could clearly feel a weakness emanating from his body, as if time had instantly accelerated a hundredfold, with years of lifespan draining every second. But accompanying this was an intense feeling of exhilaration. Zhou Tian felt like he was about to burst with pleasure.

Moments later, Zhou Tian's body withered like a flower, turning into a puddle of mush. The seven black-robed figures were astonished, exchanging bewildered glances. *Big brother, in your pathetic state, how did you have so little life force? You were drained so quickly! We hadn't even exerted ourselves fully, and you collapsed!*

But it was true; their chains were divine objects, and not a single shred of life force could possibly be missed. Just as they were preparing to retract their chains, a naked figure suddenly appeared in the center of the array—it was Zhou Tian, who had just been absorbed into a puddle. The atmosphere fell silent for a moment. Zhou Tian watched as the black threads wrapped around him again. He frowned. While having his life force absorbed by these things felt pleasurable, dying here again would mean waiting until his resurrection count refreshed to revive, and that would take a considerable amount of time.
