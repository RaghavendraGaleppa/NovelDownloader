# Chapter 43: The Bond Between Chixiao and Tianhuang, The Goal: Panjie Meteorite Hammer!

Chixiao was a very discriminating sword.

It fawned over the ice lump, yet for Li Mo, it issued a test.

Ten strikes.

If he could take them, he would become its master.

Li Mo’s vision blurred.

*Buzz—*

A familiar swordsman silhouette appeared before him.

The atmosphere instantly turned deadly.

The swordsman slowly cupped his fist in salute.

"Please advise."

Li Mo held his cyan steel sword and returned the salute.

In the next moment, the two figures collided.

The sound of weapons clashing like metal and stone echoed throughout the entire fourth level.

***

In the third level.

All the famous swords trembled slightly at this moment.

"Is that commotion caused by Brother Li?"

Mu Murong couldn't help but look back toward the dark entrance of the fourth level.

Just now, that sword cry made the hair on his body stand on end.

"What happened?"

Xiao Qin raised his head, holding a broken giant sword in his hand.

This was what he had found under the guidance of the Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign. Among the famous weapons, though it was unattractive and only half remained, its material was superior to all others.

It was also one of the few famous weapons willing to acknowledge him as its master.

Its spirituality was a bit weak, requiring him to nurture it himself in the future.

Xiao Qin was quite satisfied with it.

However, at this moment, the giant sword was trembling slightly along with that sword cry.

"Your Junior Brother Li is currently fighting a Mystic Weapon," the Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign said casually, though he hadn't seen it personally.

"Fighting a weapon?"

Xiao Qin didn't quite understand what that meant.

"The stronger the warrior, the more formidable their spirit."

"The weapons they have used for years and months will be stained with their will."

"Do you know which sword is the strongest in the renowned Tianshan Sword Manor in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands?"

The Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign was quite willing to tell his disciple some anecdotes to broaden his horizons.

"Please enlighten me, Master," Xiao Qin said with great interest.

"It is a wooden sword that once belonged to the Sword Ancestor," the Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign said as if he had seen it with his own eyes.

"It carries an entire pure martial sword path upon it."

"Several hundred years ago, this sword flew out of the Sword Tomb for a thousand miles, cutting a river and slaying an evil dragon in one strike. To this day, the waters of that great river remain severed."

"A single strike severed a river for hundreds of years?"

Xiao Qin sucked in a cold breath upon hearing this.

To him now, this was simply an unimaginable matter.

The Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign was very satisfied with his disciple's shock and continued, "The Sword Ancestor's personal weapon is far beyond what a Mystic Weapon can compare to."

"Of course, that Chixiao is also a fine product among Mystic Weapons."

"Whether it can be mastered depends on whether your Junior Brother Li has learned anything from that girl."

"Chixiao and Tianhuang complement each other perfectly," Xiao Qin thought to himself, pursing his lips.

He wasn't envious; instead, he grew even fonder of his broken giant sword.

***

*Clang—*

In the fourth level.

Li Mo had already taken the sixth strike from Chixiao in the consciousness space.

The sword cry made him feel as if his soul was electrocuted and his consciousness was numb.

Was this the aura of a Mystic Weapon?

Or... was it the spirit, energy, and will left behind by the expert who once used this sword?

Li Mo couldn't help but recall the words the ice lump at the bottom of Qingyuan had told him.

Obsessions could turn into Yin spirits.

It was very reasonable for the spirit, energy, and will to condense into a swordsman with powerful swordsmanship.

"This sword cry seems to have the effect of tempering the spirit," Li Mo thought thoughtfully.

It was relatively weak at first, but as it went on, the feeling of tempering his spirit became more and more obvious.

"Come on," Li Mo focused his mind and calmed his breath, seriously crossing swords with it.

The seventh strike!

The eighth strike!

The ninth strike!

These three strikes had completely reached the level of perfection.

After taking nine strikes, he felt his spirit and energy had improved significantly, and his consciousness had become a bit more agile.

If it hadn't been for the ice lump's guidance, relying solely on his own hard accumulation of martial arts insights, he would have probably stopped here.

This was not strange.

It was like a difficult math problem; without mathematical talent, one might never solve the answer by pondering it alone. Ordinary people can only use the 'formulas' summarized by geniuses to take shortcuts.

"The tenth strike!"

The aura of the swordsman opposite him instantly became restrained and powerful.

Li Mo let out a breath of turbid air, focusing as never before.

***

The tenth sword cry rang through the Divine Weapon Cave.

It lingered for a long time, like a helpless sigh.

Outside the Divine Weapon Cave.

"Chixiao has acknowledged its master," Elder Han He said, stroking his beard, his expression slightly strange.

No one, as the Elder in charge of the Divine Weapon Peak, understood the meaning of this sword cry better than him.

Chixiao had acknowledged its master, yes.

But it seemed to be doing so with a bit of reluctance...

It seemed not very satisfied with Li Mo's talent.

It looked down on him a bit, yet still gritted its teeth and accepted him as its master?

This left Elder Han He quite confused.

"Hahaha, old man, both Mystic Weapons are in my hands now," Shang Wu said, not caring about the details, so proud she was almost putting her hands on her hips.

Elder Han He said expressionlessly, "Tianhuang belongs to Ying Bing. What does Ying Bing have to do with you?"

Shang Wu looked at him, a hint of pity and sympathy in her eyes.

The elder's forehead twitched twice.

This gaze was very impolite.

"By the way, old man, even if we don't count Little Bing'er's matter, that's still two."

"We made a bet back then."

"Like this, I won't make you suffer a loss. You don't need to help me settle my debts anymore. As long as I need it, I can go down to your Divine Weapon Cave and take any weapon to use," Shang Wu smiled with narrowed eyes.

"Hmph! Only one at a time!" Han He snorted.

No matter how stubborn he was, he wouldn't dare say that the outcome was still uncertain.

It wasn't that he lacked confidence in Mu Murong, but that being acknowledged by a Mystic Weapon meant Li Mo's swordsmanship was certainly extraordinary.

Moreover, holding a Mystic Weapon, who in the same realm could defeat him?

Letting Shang Wu take weapons from the Divine Weapon Cave, even if she damaged them, was still better than settling her huge debts.

"Old man, the only good thing about you is that you never go back on your word," Shang Wu said, seeing he had accepted, and sent two nice words his way.

Ying Bing's expression was calm; she wasn't surprised by this.

It was the first time she had seriously taught someone.

If she couldn't even get her hands on a Mystic Weapon, that would be too much of a failure.

"Chixiao..."

"Miss Ying took Tianhuang. If I remember correctly, these two swords seem to have a combined technique?"

"I've seen similar records too."

***

Some senior disciples of the Divine Weapon Peak looked at each other and simultaneously recalled the records.

Legend has it that the Ancestor created these two swords and bestowed them upon his two disciples.

Those two were a couple with an extremely good relationship. They even created a combined sword technique because of this, allowing them to battle above their realm, and it was famous in the East Wilderness domain at the time.

Later, the two passed away, and Tianhuang and Chixiao were never acknowledged by masters simultaneously again.

That sword technique was then shelved away, and no one ever saw its brilliance again.

Today, these two Mystic Weapons have once again each found a master...

Everyone looked at Ying Bing.

But they saw no emotion on the face of the jade-like girl.

***

At the same time.

"Pretty cold," Li Mo held the long sword resembling flowing fire in his palm, unable to contain his joy.

His own sword talent wasn't good.

But he happened to have practiced a superior sword technique to perfection at this age.

That was why Chixiao reluctantly acknowledged him as its master.

But... reluctance or not didn't matter, as long as it could be used.

Little Li didn't care if the melon was sweet or not; as long as it quenched his thirst.

"I have swordsmanship, and I have a precious sword."

"Who else could be a swordsman but me?" Li Mo smiled happily.

At this moment.

He looked toward the end of the fourth level of the Divine Weapon Cave, at the entrance where firelight and cold light intertwined.

The call from that direction was becoming stronger.

The cool matter was settled.

Naturally, he had to consider what could truly make him stronger.

"Panjie Meteorite Hammer," Li Mo's eyes reflected the light from the entrance.

Although using a hammer didn't quite match his interests...

But... this is a Divine Weapon!

It is a supreme treasure completely beyond his comprehension.

Moreover, it could vaguely resonate with his Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body, complementing each other.

"It wants to come with me."

"But first, I need to be able to get close to it and pick it up," Li Mo walked past the entrance.

Instantly, he felt an extremely strong pressure.

The icy cold spring, the scorching hot spring, plus that formidable weapon-killing aura, almost made it hard to breathe.

If it weren't for his body refinement showing initial success, and him having taken a Six-Striped Clear Heart Pill, he wouldn't even have the qualification to stand here.

*Thump—*

He took a step forward.

Instantly, a thunderous sound echoed through the void.

His entire body's five organs, meridians, and blood qi were shaken.

That feeling of his bones itching made Li Mo clearly realize.

His physique had become stronger again.

"I only took a single step forward..."

Li Mo gained a clearer understanding of the power of the Divine Weapon.

And.

This was probably the result of the Divine Weapon having a spirit and restraining most of its pressure!

"Continue walking!" Li Mo activated his Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body and moved his feet again.

At the same time, the sound of giant hammers falling rang out in his ears.
