Chapter 1: The Human Verification

The screen flickered, displaying a stark message that seemed out of place within the grand narrative of the cultivation world.

"Verify you are human by completing the action below."

Jian Xingzhi stared at the glowing characters, his spiritual sense probing the barrier that separated him from the vast knowledge of the outside world. The system demanded a proof of existence, a verification of his humanity before it would allow him to proceed.

"Verification successful," the screen announced after a moment.

He waited, the silence of the void stretching out around him. The system was processing, searching for a connection to the ancient archives.

Jian Xingzhi frowned, sensing the flow of data beginning to stabilize as the required protocols were engaged. The barrier dissolved, and the path to the next chapter of his journey opened before him.
