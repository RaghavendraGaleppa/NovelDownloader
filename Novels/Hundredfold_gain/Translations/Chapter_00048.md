# Chapter 48: Pupil Technique - Clear Insight Eyes

As the understanding of the Clear Insight Eyes emerged in his mind, Qi Chuan couldn't help but feel surprised. The ancient booklet he had obtained wasn't a cultivation technique, but rather a rare pupil technique.

Pupil techniques were essentially a type of spell among the myriad of magical arts, though they were relatively uncommon. Most of them enhanced the eyes, granting cultivators special visual effects. Some bizarre pupil techniques could even open a third eye on a human cultivator's forehead. Such peculiar techniques were usually exceptionally powerful, possessing various mysterious effects unknown to most.

However, such strange pupil techniques were extremely rare. Throughout the entire cultivation world, they were highly prized, and even sects at the level of Fengyue Sect were unlikely to possess them. The Clear Insight Eyes before him naturally wasn't one of those powerful, bizarre techniques—it couldn't open a third or fourth eye. It could only strengthen a cultivator's existing pair of eyes.

Based on the insights Qi Chuan had just gained, mastering the Clear Insight Eyes to a profound level would grant special enhancements to the eyes, bestowing a trace of a "penetrating" effect that could see through illusions. It was only useful at the Qi Refining stage and couldn't be considered a particularly powerful pupil technique.

Still, even so, if one could cultivate the Clear Insight Eyes to perfection, it would remain somewhat useful even at the Foundation Establishment stage. Thus, for Qi Chuan, this was a rather decent pupil technique. After all, with his hundredfold amplification, as long as he put in continuous effort, he would undoubtedly be able to master it to perfection.

Once perfected, the Clear Insight Eyes would serve him well in battles, exploring unfamiliar territories, and even covertly observing others' secrets—all the way until he reached the Golden Core stage.

"I must cultivate the Clear Insight Eyes!" Qi Chuan resolved inwardly.

In the cultivation world, techniques and methods were ever-changing, making it hard to guard against all threats. Having a profound pupil technique would allow him to counter many of these hidden dangers.

Despite his determination to obtain the Clear Insight Eyes, Qi Chuan didn't immediately claim it for himself. Instead, he handed it to Murong Fan and said, "This is a pupil technique. Take a look."

His collaboration with Murong Fan had been pleasant so far, with both parties benefiting. While he couldn't predict the future, for now, Murong Fan seemed like an honest man. As long as he didn't cause trouble, Qi Chuan saw no reason to shortchange him.

"A pupil technique?" Murong Fan was visibly surprised.

He took the Clear Insight Eyes and began examining it. After a short while, he reluctantly set it down.

After a moment of hesitation, he said, "You can have the Clear Insight Eyes. After all, I’ve already taken the Entwined Fish and Serpent Technique."

Pupil techniques were notoriously difficult to cultivate. Though Murong Fan hadn't gained any immediate insights from his brief reading, he had gleaned some information about the Clear Insight Eyes. While it was indeed a decent technique—useful even at the Foundation Establishment stage if perfected—the reality was that pupil techniques were hard to even begin mastering, let alone bring to perfection. The effort and time required were immense, with success far from guaranteed.

Unless perfected, the Clear Insight Eyes was merely a slightly rare and special Qi Refining-level spell. For families like the Qis and the Murongs, it was hard to say whether the Clear Insight Eyes or the Entwined Fish and Serpent Technique held greater value. After all, if used well, the latter's unique trait of making cultivation easier could allow a family to produce many more mid-to-late Qi Refining cultivators. There was even a chance that a Murong family member, particularly suited to the technique, might barely reach the tenth layer of Qi Refining before turning sixty—something they might not have achieved otherwise—thereby advancing to Foundation Establishment and adding another major cultivator to the family.

From this perspective, the Entwined Fish and Serpent Technique might actually be more valuable.

Neither of them suggested making copies for both parties—whether out of unspoken agreement or otherwise.

"Since Brother Murong insists, I won’t refuse." Seeing Murong Fan relinquish the Clear Insight Eyes, Qi Chuan was slightly surprised but had an inkling of his reasoning. With a smile, he accepted the technique.

Then, he turned his attention to the two remaining items on the ground and said casually, "As for these two artifacts, we’ll take one each."

Before them lay two artifacts—technically top-grade ones, highly valuable. Unfortunately, due to their age or improper storage, they were damaged beyond repair. They could only be dismantled for materials, drastically reducing their worth. Even their primary materials were half-ruined, diminishing their value further.

"Agreed." Murong Fan nodded, equally indifferent to the mostly ruined top-grade artifacts.

Thus, Qi Chuan and Murong Fan each took one of the damaged artifacts.

Finally, there was a small pile of low-grade spirit stones—about a hundred in total. The amount was negligible, so they split them evenly, each taking a few dozen.

With that, the spoils from the treasure map expedition were fully distributed.

"Now that this matter is settled, let’s return to the sect," Qi Chuan said, standing up with evident satisfaction.

Murong Fan, too, felt he had gained much from the journey.

The two then left the cave. However, when passing through the fork where the mid-tier Black Jade Spirit Snakes had nested earlier, Qi Chuan cut open the snake corpses and extracted their gallbladders—the most valuable part of the creatures. He took both, compensating Murong Fan with some spirit stones.

Murong Fan didn’t know why Qi Chuan wanted the gallbladders, but since he had little use for them himself—they would have been traded for resources anyway—he was content with the arrangement.

Qi Chuan’s reasoning was simple: he wanted an extra gallbladder to ensure success in refining the Black Jade Restoration Pill, sparing no expense to resolve his second uncle’s meridian issue.

After collecting the gallbladders, the two headed out of Black Serpent Abyss and soon returned to Black Serpent City.

"Brother Qi, I plan to return to my family first to present the Entwined Fish and Serpent Technique before heading back to the sect. Let’s part ways here and meet again at the sect," Murong Fan said, clasping his hands in farewell after leaving the city.

"Then we’ll meet again at the sect," Qi Chuan replied with a similar gesture.

As Murong Fan turned to leave, he suddenly remembered something and paused. "By the way, since Black Serpent City borders the Black Serpent Abyss and has a mix of cultivators and mortals, there’s a market a few miles southwest of here. If you have trouble selling that damaged artifact, you might try there."
