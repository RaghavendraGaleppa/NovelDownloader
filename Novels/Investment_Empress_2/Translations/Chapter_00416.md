# Chapter 416: The Holy Master Seeks Employment Again, and the Being within the Heavenly Phoenix Domain!

The youth’s figure vanished. Immediately after, more people, like sharks smelling blood, swarmed forward to fight for the divine object. Elder Zeng’s expression froze instantly, the hand gripping his sword trembling.

“Li Mo!”

The Three Heroes of Hengyun wore identical expressions of disbelief.

The youngest among their peers, yet the one who rose the fastest, the young hero Li who returned unscathed from the midst of tens of thousands of troops in the Southern Frontier... had he died just like that?

If it had been someone else, it would seem normal enough.

After all, life is unpredictable...

But he was the旺妻斗魂 (Wang Qi Dou Hun - roughly "Soul of the Fighting Spirit who Brings Fortune to his Wife") who had the potential to top the Hidden Dragon List, the Little Tyrant with the Divine Hammer...

“It's over...”

“What's over?”

“The Demon Summoning Sect is over.” Bai Jinghong shivered.

Wu Chushu and Cao Mu exchanged a glance, and the image of that fairy’s cold, aloof, and stunning face suddenly surfaced in their minds. Both couldn't help but shudder.

Would Miss Ying go on a rampage...

Well.

Before that, it seemed someone else was about to lose it.

“Master / Martial Uncle? You...”

“Junior Brother Li is dead. I have no heart left to argue over right and wrong.”

Elder Zeng took off his black head covering and slapped it onto the ground. He turned back with a heavy heart:

“We must see the corpse. We must bring him back to the Clear Abyss Sect to give the elders an explanation.”

“Let's go help!”

A short while later.

Since many people had gone to fight for that seemingly ordinary pearl, and Elder Zeng was a powerhouse even among the Fifth Realm, they finally managed to seize Junior Brother Li’s ‘remains’.

“Damn it, Brother Li is reduced to just a single hair!”

Looking at the single strand of hair in Elder Zeng’s palm, Bai Jinghong was filled with grief and indignation. He clenched his fist and slammed it heavily against the nearby mountain rock.

“Let's go to the Clear Abyss Sect, sigh!”

Elder Zeng carefully stored the hair away and let out a heavy sigh, preparing to go comfort the family of the deceased.

......

Autumn Water Pavilion.

The steam of a boiling hot pot drifted over the Autumn Water Pavilion. Having just experienced the thrilling adventure of the underground palace and tomb, they were finally eating hot pot and singing songs.

If one ignored the fact that the tomb owner was sitting at the same table, the scene was quite warm and harmonious.

“It's over, it's all over.”

Qin Yuzhi mechanically swirled mutton in the pot, muttering to herself with a lost look in her eyes.

Li Mo didn't know what to say.

Her career was gone, and everyone she knew had distanced themselves from her.

It had a rather desolate and bewildering feeling of reaching middle age, having everything come to an end, and wanting to speak but tears falling first.

“Ah, actually, looking at it from another angle, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. At least you're still sitting here, able to eat and drink.”

“You can always start over. Do you have any plans for the future?”

“Don't know.”

Qin Yuzhi shook her head, chewing on the spicy, fragrant mutton. Her wounded soul seemed to have found a bit of comfort.

“Would you be interested in seeking employment again?”

Li Mo glanced at the ice lump whose cheeks were gently moving, a hint of pleasure showing in her eyes, and asked seriously.

Well, Little Li actually had a selfish motive.

Every word that the Cloud Dream Immortal had said was etched in his heart. The more he thought about it, the more it seemed like it wasn't just a simple curse.

The same situation that happened to Qin Yuzhi was very likely to occur in the future to the ice lump.

He had already witnessed the terror of the Cloud Dream Immortal.

A Demon Summoning Holy Master who was once half a step away from the Tongtian Realm could only use self-sealing and slumber to prevent her awakening, and ultimately failed. If they hadn't been clever, that being might have returned by now.

And according to her, that Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix was the foremost among the Nine Heavens...

It was probably even more troublesome!

Perhaps one day in the future, that consciousness might awaken within the ice lump...

Even with his cheat, Li Mo didn't know how to handle such a situation.

Although Qin Yuzhi didn't seem very reliable, she was the only known survivor who had gone through this ordeal and remained unharmed. At the very least, she was a powerful expert of the Xuan Profound Realm who had mastered the Dream Dao.

“How do I seek employment again?” Qin Yuzhi asked.

“Ahem, for example, joining my Myriad Phenomena Limited... uh, Immortal Sect!”

“Immortal Sect?”

Qin Yuzhi blinked. It sounded quite impressive.

An Immortal Sect!

The Demon Summoning Sect was founded by a true immortal, yet it didn't dare to take such a name, unable to bear such a karmic connection.

“But, why haven't I heard of it...”

“It's normal. When the Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect was established, you were still sleeping.”

Li Mo picked up his teacup and took a sip to moisten his throat:

“Our sect's current business is mainly in the Southern Frontier, and we have already reached a strategic cooperation with the Demon Summoning Sect.”

“Huh?”

Qin Yuzhi was stunned.

She recognized every character, but how did they not make sense when put together?

Tian Miao also looked on with curiosity.

Ying Bing looked at the eloquent Little Li, a hint of helplessness curling at the corner of her mouth.

He was at it again.

“Is this Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect you're talking about... this place?” Qin Yuzhi asked. This place didn't look like an Immortal Sect at all.

“Of course not. This place is the Clear Abyss Sect.”

“Clear Abyss... So it's the Imperial Mausoleum.”

Hearing the familiar name, Qin Yuzhi nodded.

“Right. Before joining the Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect, you need to stay at the Autumn Water Pavilion and also report to the elders of the Clear Abyss Sect.”

“Hah?”

Qin Yuzhi scratched the back of her head.

Finding a job... no, joining a faction... was the procedure this complicated and tedious?

Holy Master Qin almost got dizzy from the confusion, completely unable to grasp the situation.

“I'm finished eating. I'm going to rest for a bit.”

Ying Bing put down her chopsticks and stood up.

“Call me if you need help sleeping.”

“.....”

In the boudoir on the second floor of the Autumn Water Pavilion, outside the window was the苍山负雪 (Cangshan carrying snow - a famous scenic spot).

The frost and snow covering the mountains were indeed charming, but they paled in comparison to the girl's face.

Ying Bing sat quietly by the bed, listening to the sound of the boy's endless chatter outside. She closed her eyes and gently bit her lip.

Might she become a different person?

A person she didn't even recognize herself, a person... who no longer remembered him... returning to the state she was in at the桂 Palace (Osmanthus Palace).

Her fair, slender fingers unconsciously tightened on the pure black skirt.

“It won't happen.”

“In this life, I have an 'System' that defies common sense. There is always a solution to everything.”

Thoughts churned, and suddenly, Ying Bing felt a wave of palpitations. It felt as if her heart had suddenly contracted, gripped by an invisible hand, making it difficult to breathe.

In the midst of it all, it seemed someone was calling out to her, waiting for her...

The Heavenly Phoenix Domain!

It was the Heavenly Phoenix Domain!

Divine light surged, illuminating Ying Bing's jade-like face. The divine light of half the Heavenly Phoenix Domain was reflected in her eyes.

Also reflected within them was the figure inside.

Who?!

Furthermore, she could sense it.

That being's gaze was fixed upon her.
