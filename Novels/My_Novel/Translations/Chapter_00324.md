# Chapter 324: Li Xian in Peril? A Countermove! Investigating the House of Unspoken Sorrows, How Could It Be Her?

The winds and clouds in Flying Dragon City were ever-changing. Yang Xinqiang, clad in white armor and wielding a silver spear, had sword-like brows and star-like eyes, exceptionally handsome and heroic. He was a renowned young hero in Flying Dragon City. Since participating in the search for the Flower Cage Sect, he had quickly achieved remarkable results.

He pursued criminals and captured thieves with genuine skill. On the first day, he narrowed the scope, strictly inspecting merchants who had entered the city within the past two months. Simultaneously, he sent people to interrogate guests at major inns.

Once this plan was implemented, it yielded immediate and miraculous results. The elders of the Flower Cage Sect were thrown into a panic, never expecting to be caught in such a deadly trap, their throats choked tight. They cursed the young man in secret, wishing they could flay him alive.

Flying Dragon City was vast with numerous inns; it might take some time to inspect thoroughly enough to find the Flower Cage Sect. However, escape was now impossible. Yang Xinqiang issued another command, declaring that members of the Flower Cage Sect could turn over a new leaf. If they exposed each other, their crimes would be reduced, and their lives spared.

Even to the point where their merits could offset their demerits, rendering them innocent.

This strategy was highly effective. In an instant, the Flower Cage Sect members feared for their lives, and suspicion grew between them. The elders also guarded against each other, afraid of being exposed. Within a short day, over a dozen disciples surrendered. Yang Xinqiang presided over the situation, selecting a few with lighter offenses, dragging them to the marketplace to receive fifty strokes of the paddle, and then declaring them innocent.

This strategy struck directly at their hearts. The remaining flower thieves all thought: "Surviving with just fifty strokes is an incredibly profitable deal! Why should we, of lowly status, fight to the death?" The trend of surrendering became even more apparent. The Flower Cage Sect was on the verge of collapse, crumbling at the brink of defeat. This was far more effective than laborious inspections or wanted notices. For a time, the flower thieves were restless, all wishing to turn over a new leaf and voluntarily surrender.

The elders of the various sword sects were strong in martial arts but lacked Yang Xinqiang's expertise in catching criminals. They all praised him incessantly, following his arrangements. Yang Xinqiang was very familiar with Flying Dragon City, knew the main thoroughfares, and assigned the five sects to guard them respectively, making the city as secure as a fortress.

Step by step, they compressed the space.

Another day passed like this. With the increase in surrendered disciples providing many clues, the portraits of the elders and tattooed disciples became increasingly clear. Nearly half of the merchants from the past two months had been inspected. Following this momentum, capturing Li Xian within three days was not an empty boast.

Late that night.

In Liuhua Street, Biechun Garden. The elders were all fearful and had no choice but to gather in the hall to discuss escape. Each was on guard, lacking the calmness of the past.

Tang Wenshu cursed: "That brat surnamed Yang has such formidable methods. In just a short day, he has left us nowhere to hide! If we delay any longer, we will surely be besieged by heavy troops."

Ye Cheng muttered: "The crisis today is far greater than before. In the past, when we flower thieves were surrounded, there were always loopholes and many opportunities to turn the tables. If it were just the city defense of Flying Dragon City, we would still have a chance to escape. We could even command the thieves to form a formation and force our way through. But偏偏 the five great sword sects are assisting with all their might. Hard confrontation is certainly not a good strategy, and hiding is no different from waiting for death. That Yang Xinqiang is truly not to be underestimated. A few strategies have left us completely helpless."

Tang Wenshu said: "It has always been our Flower Cage Sect causing trouble, but this time before we even acted, we were firmly slapped with a huge hat, how unjust! Now we are being pressed step by step, it's extremely troublesome, extremely troublesome!"

An Weicheng said: "Brother Li Xian, what do you think about this matter?" Everyone looked at him with strange expressions. They all knew Li Xian's real name. There were many rumors in the market, difficult to wash away the infamy, slanderous reputation weighing on him. Li Xian remained calm and composed, saying: "From my recent observations, Flying Dragon City is pressing step by step, determined to kill us all. However... there may not be a lack of a turning point."

Everyone looked at him simultaneously.

Li Xian had distributed strands of his hair to the elders. If there were any clues, they could immediately use the hair to transmit sound. He gathered information from multiple sources and was the most informed about the city's situation. He appeared calm and steady, already showing the demeanor of a leader among the flower thieves.

Li Xian pondered: "Logically speaking, since this matter was not done by us, the real culprit must be preparing a way out for us. If we were captured, his deeds would be exposed."

"But this time the situation is different. The enemy is extremely vicious, trying to kill us at every turn. The encirclement by Flying Dragon City is fierce. Relying on this is equivalent to handing our lives over to others, letting them slaughter us. We must still strive to find our own way out."

The elders nodded repeatedly. Ye Cheng said: "I originally thought of lying low and waiting, observing the changes in the situation. If we found an opportunity, we could just take the blame and flee. After all, it wouldn't be more than an extra bad reputation. But the city defense is getting stricter day by day, the various sword sects are searching everywhere, and the main roads are all blocked."

"The 'Flying Feather Cavalry' of Flying Dragon City has already taken to the streets for patrol. I have long heard of the Flying Feather Cavalry; they are all rare talents with considerable ability. Furthermore, Flying Dragon City trains 'Hunting Hounds'. These dogs have red noses and are exceptionally sensitive, searching door to door. If we don't escape now, there will be no more opportunities."

Li Xian's situation was even more perilous than the others. He said: "I learned that Flying Dragon City has the Daoyun River. The river is congested with merchant ships, and both sides of the river are densely packed with cargo ships. In just a few days, complaints have been mounting, all wishing to leave the city as soon as possible."

Ye Cheng's eyes lit up: "We might be able to hide among them. When the resentment accumulates, Flying Dragon City will surely have to open a passage to allow the merchant ships to pass."

Li Xian nodded: "I know of a great clan in Flying Dragon City, the Duan family, which handles the timber trade. Their merchant ships are piled high with 'Gold-threaded Wood', which is thick and sturdy. If we, after carefully investigating the key points, secretly hollow out the inside of the Gold-threaded Wood and hide inside, we might be able to sneak out of the city."

Li Xian clasped his hands towards everyone: "If you listen to my suggestion, why not do it this way? Let's eat our fill at night, prepare plenty of food and water, and hide inside the timber. Then ignore everything outside. Perhaps two days, three days, or five days... Hiding like this, I estimate that within at most seven days, shipping will definitely resume. By then, who could predict that we would have long hidden inside the timber? Even if they search strictly, what could they do?"

Upon hearing this, the elders all clapped their hands in admiration: "What a wonderful plan, what a wonderful plan. We will hide early, and it's hard for them to predict."

Ye Cheng smiled: "If we are lucky, shipping might resume tomorrow, and perhaps we can escape tomorrow."

Li Jiu asked: "What if the place we hide is discovered?" Li Xian said: "I have already investigated. The shipping area is complex, gathering from all corners of the world. We hide inside the timber, then use cotton to fill the hollow space inside. When patted, it will sound like solid wood, and we might avoid the inspection."

"There is no news of resuming shipping yet, so they definitely won't guess that we have long hidden inside the ships. By the time the news of resuming shipping is released, they will definitely inspect the ships strictly and guard all around. But by then, we will have already hidden inside the timber for a period of time. Even if they are strictly guarding against us, they would never expect that we have already潜伏. They will definitely be negligent."

An Weicheng asked: "What if shipping never resumes?"

Li Xian said: "Shipping is the lifeline of a city; how can it be blocked for long? Although Flying Dragon City is determined to capture us, they dare not act recklessly. If shipping is blocked for too long, it will affect the city's operation, and families and common people will surely complain. Therefore, shipping will definitely resume in the near future."

The elders pondered carefully, and praise was unending.

An Weicheng's eyes flickered: "I can help with this plan. The Duan family's Gold-threaded Wood is on the river merchant ships. Tonight, we can secretly hollow it out, and we can hide inside! When we see the light of day again, we will be free!" The elders' eyes flickered. They discussed for half the night, all feeling it was worth the risk to try, and moved immediately that night.

The next morning, the marketplace was lively and bustling. The Flower Cage Sect's escape plan was brewing secretly. They perfectly潜藏 inside the timber of the Duan family's merchant ship.

That noon.

At the mouth of the Daoyun River, the sound of horseshoes was suddenly heard. Yang Xinqiang, in his white armor, stood proudly with his spear, saying to the crowd: "Capturing the flower thieves has been effective. From this moment on, Flying Dragon City will resume shipping. Any ship on the river, after inspection and verification, can enter and leave Flying Dragon City."

The Daoyun River was congested with nearly a thousand merchant ships. The river channel was wide, but shipping was blocked. Complaints echoed through the river lanes. If shipping did not resume, it blocked people's paths to wealth, no different from killing their parents. Under this silent pressure, shipping was indeed opened, allowing ships to come and go.

Yang Xinqiang was young but held a high position. After issuing the news, he surveyed the area with proud eyes, looking confident and calm.

There was a gorge in the Daoyun River. Ships had to pass through this point to enter or leave. The gorge was very narrow, only wide enough for one ship.

He guarded the river gorge, stopping ships leaving the city, and sending people to search them. They inspected cabins, bedrooms, decks, holds... Any place where a person could hide was strictly checked, with no room for error. Below the river, "Cotton Nets" were spread. These nets did not block the water flow and did not affect shipping. But if a thief tried to swim, they would be entangled in the Cotton Net and could not escape.

Yang Xinqiang thought: "That group of flower thieves has hidden on the ships, thinking I don't know. Among them, there is indeed a clever one. It's a pity that they are just flower thieves, with petty tricks, ultimately just adding to the laughter. When their whereabouts are discovered later, they will inevitably be driven to desperation and jump into the river to escape. Then the Cotton Nets will entangle them, and we can capture them all effortlessly."

Beside him were Zhou Shijie, Wang Dezhong, and others assisting with the inspection. Several ships passed the inspection and were indeed error-free, leaving Flying Dragon City.

Wang Dezhong said: "Brother Yang, according to what you said, are there really flower thieves on these ships? How can you be so sure? If we let them go in such a hurry and there is a mistake, wouldn't that be bad?" Here, troops were gathered, densely deployed. Disciples and some elders of the five great sword sects were secretly watching, dressed in plain clothes, hiding around.

Yang Xinqiang was twenty-seven, slightly older. Recently, his abilities had been fully displayed, with clever strategies emerging one after another, earning the appreciation of the sect elders. Wang Dezhong and Zhou Shijie followed him to learn. Zhou Shijie said: "If I'm not mistaken. Brother Yang is confident. His strict inspection of the Flower Cage Sect has been highly effective. The flower thieves must be under pressure. Seeing a chance to escape now, they will surely try their luck. They don't know that this is exactly what we want. This is the real killing intent."

"There are so many merchant ships here; it's estimated that it will take five or six days to pass them all. During this period, they will surely try to混入 the merchant ships and escape from here. Once they come, there will naturally be flaws. This is the strategy of waiting for the rabbit to come and luring the enemy."

Yang Xinqiang smiled confidently: "What Brother Zhou said makes some sense, but it's both right and wrong. I said I would capture that flower thief Li Xian within three days, so I naturally have confidence, not just empty boasts. Today is the third day. If I follow Brother Zhou's words, I'm afraid I might not be able to capture that thief today or tomorrow. Wouldn't I break my promise?"

Yang Wentian said: "Oh? Does Brother Yang have a way to catch the Flower Cage Sect thieves today?"

Yang Xinqiang smiled without speaking, lightly nodding.

Zhou Shijie was eager to try: "If that Li Xian refuses to accept arrest, I must be the one to take action and capture him. This boy and I have a history; it's best to settle it here." Yang Xinqiang smiled: "It doesn't matter; he definitely can't run. If Brother Zhou wants to show his skills, please go ahead."

Zhou Shijie was overjoyed. By evening, they inspected the Duan family's large timber transport ship. The ship arrived at the gorge, carrying huge logs, which were perfect for hiding people. Yang Xinqiang smiled slightly: "Brother Zhou, the opportunity is right before your eyes. Please prepare yourself."

Everyone was surprised. Hua Wu of the Lishan Sword Sect asked: "Brother Yang, how do you know for sure that the thief is on this ship?" Yang Xinqiang smiled: "You asked me before why I was so confident. Now I will explain. Come out!"

Suddenly, a person walked out from the soldiers behind him. He was middle-aged, wearing armor, dressed like an ordinary soldier. It was An Weicheng of the Flower Cage Sect. It turned out he had long intended to defect. But as an elder, if he surrendered voluntarily, his crimes would be hard to offset, and he would surely die. So he secretly lay low, waiting for a critical moment to make a great contribution to redeem himself and exchange for his own life.

Last night, hearing Li Xian's brilliant plan, although he felt it was feasible, betraying them for survival was more secure. He knew the opportunity was rare and secretly reported it overnight, coordinating from inside and outside.

Shipping was originally supposed to resume in a few days. After his betrayal, Yang Xinqiang was confident. Moreover, the long blockage of Flying Dragon City was indeed a major problem, so he opened shipping.

Wang Dezhong drew his sword in anger: "It's the Flower Cage Sect elder An Weicheng? Good thief, how dare you潜伏!" He raised his sword to strike.

Yang Xinqiang swept his spear, blocking the sword, and smiled: "Brother Wang, you misunderstand. This man has turned over a new leaf. I ordered him to disguise himself and follow, to see the fate of his companions." An Weicheng said: "Yes, yes, I have abandoned darkness for light. Brother Yang has been kind enough to allow me to turn over a new leaf. I will do good deeds and accumulate merit in the future, to make up for my faults."

Wang Dezhong, still angry, said: "This man不知 how many women he has harmed. Can a light phrase like 'turning over a new leaf' make everything as if it never happened?"

Yang Xinqiang said: "That may be so, but without this man's help, these flower thieves hide deeply, and it would be hard to avoid missing some. These escaped flower thieves will harm women in the future, which is also a crime. This Brother An Weicheng, to have such determination, is very good. Without his help, it would be difficult to succeed."

Yang Xinqiang smiled: "Brother An, since you have turned over a new leaf, please lead the way." The Duan family's large ship was specially made, longer and wider, holding thousands of Gold-threaded Wood logs, some ten zhang long, some five or six zhang, all are materials for beams and pillars. Even if they intended to inspect carefully, they might miss something.

An Weicheng clasped his hands: "Of course." He walked towards the timber storage area, and among the many logs, he accurately found a few, exposing the logs where people were hidden, all hidden very deeply.

Wang Dezhong said: "Is there really someone hidden in this wood?" He patted it with his palm; the sound was thick and solid. It didn't sound hollow inside. An Weicheng said: "It's absolutely true. That group of flower thieves, forced by the hero Yang, acted overnight, hollowing out the timber to hide inside. That Li Xian is as cunning as a fox; he even knew to use cotton to fill it. Patted from the outside, there is no hollow sound."

Yang Xinqiang thought: "That thief is quite clever, but ultimately just at the end of his rope. Hiding inside the timber, using cotton to seal it, although it makes the timber sound solid when patted. But I am skilled in palm techniques. If I use my palm to strike, I can immediately sense the difference. Even without An Weicheng's betrayal, they couldn't escape."

"But being able to capture them quickly is a good thing anyway."

Wang Dezhong, Zhou Shijie, Yang Wentian, and others all secretly felt that the江湖 thieves were extremely cunning, with strange tricks emerging one after another, greatly broadening their horizons.

Yang Xinqiang said: "Split these timbers open!" He turned to the soldiers and said: "Pass the order, surround the area. Although the Flower Cage Sect elders have some cultivation, they are not weak. Archers in the distance, be ready."

"Brother Wang, Brother Hua... Have you arranged everything in your sects? When the thieves appear later, they will surely fight back desperately. I hope your sect elders and disciples will assist. I want to capture them all alive and interrogate them."

Wang Dezhong said: "The Jiushan Sword Sect is already hidden in the dark, blocking Fuyun Street, Changshou Street, and other places." Hua Wu also reported the arrangements, confirming that all locations were secure.

The guards beside Yang Xinqiang then split the timber. The Gold-threaded Wood was extremely tough; a single slash only left a scratch. Zhou Shijie said: "Let me do it." He drew his sword and walked to a log. He channeled his internal energy and thrust his sword down.

The log cracked with a咔嚓 sound, splitting in half. It was indeed hollow inside, and a ball of cotton sprayed out. Everyone was delighted and was about to look closely. But they smelled a strange odor.

Yang Xinqiang's expression changed, and he shouted loudly: "Jump into the river!" He jumped into the river first. Wang Dezhong, Zhou Shijie, Yang Wentian... All were skilled in lightness techniques. Although they didn't know the situation, seeing Yang Xinqiang's panic and fear, they immediately followed. The strange odor spread, and white smoke gradually rose.

The laborers on the ship all jumped into the river. It took a full seven or eight breaths before a "rumbling" sound was heard. The Duan family's merchant ship exploded with a deafening bang. Nearly a thousand logs tumbled into the river.

Zhou Shijie, Wang Dezhong, Yang Xinqiang, and others jumped into the river and sank immediately upon touching the water. They couldn't even figure out what was happening. They immediately tried to get out of the water. Wang Dezhong took out a dart, wrapped silk thread around the end, and was about to throw the dart into the bottom of the ship, then use the pulling force to surface.

But as he moved, he suddenly saw countless fine threads drifting in the water, as thin as fine hair, but spreading very long. Every time he moved, he would get entangled in the fine threads. The more he struggled the more he was entangled, gradually hindering his movements, making it difficult even to move.

He was terrified, and his movements became more intense. The fine threads became denser and denser, wrapping him into a cocoon. Zhou Shijie, Wang Dezhong, Yang Xinqiang, and others were all the same.

This thing was "Cotton Silk," arranged by Yang Xinqiang. It scattered in the water, turning into countless loose threads. Once touched, it would stick, and it was impossible to sort out; it only got more and more tangled. It was an excellent material for capturing underwater thieves. Who would have thought that all his painstaking efforts would fall on himself? All of them thought: "My life is over! Capturing thieves has failed, and I have ended up drowning." They sank straight to the bottom of the river.

After a while, they faintly felt their bodies floating up. A moment later, they were all out of the water, pulled to the shore. They were "netted" and caught. The several men were like white cocoons, all wrapped tightly. Although they were out of the water, they couldn't tear open the cotton net. Struggling hard was useless, leaving only frustration.

They heard the people on the shore cheering and shouting: "Although we don't know what that explosion was just now, Brother Yang Xinqiang said that anyone entangled in the cotton net is likely a flower thief."

"Brother Yang is so prophetic; it really came true. There are quite a few people here, one, two, three... There are at least seventeen or eighteen."

"This trip has yielded a great harvest. Brother Yang said that although the Flower Cage Sect are crude flower thieves, several elders already have the third realm cultivation. We shouldn't get too close. We will guard here; you go quickly and summon the elders."

The men's faces turned red, wanting to shout. But the cotton silk was tightly wrapped, even their tongues and teeth were not spared. They couldn't open their mouths, so they couldn't speak. Seeing more and more people gathering around, they felt as if their hearts were dead. Losing face was inevitable.

Yang Xinqiang gritted his teeth, filled with anger, almost going mad.

Meanwhile, on the other side. Li Xian, Tang Wenshu, and Ye Cheng, disguised as merchants, carrying a few trusted disciples, had already arrived at the gate of the House of Unspoken Sorrows.

It turned out that last night's conversation was all an act. Hiding inside the timber seemed feasible at first glance, but it was full of flaws. It was neither safe nor clever, not a strategy he favored.

Li Xian was certain that a crisis reveals people's hearts. By saying it deliberately last night, someone would surely betray them. So he turned the tables, filling the timber with cotton and a special "flower oil." This flower oil had a very strange smell. It was very easy to ignite and explode when chopped by a sword or blade, but its medicinal effect could heal the liver and spleen. It was refined from water jars. Tang Wenshu and Ye Cheng had transported it to Flying Dragon City for sale.

In this way, they could attract attention. Meanwhile, they took the opportunity to investigate the "House of Unspoken Sorrows." Li Xian pondered: "To escape outward, we would face the siege and pursuit of Flying Dragon City and the five great sword sects. Even if we escaped the city gates, we would be pursued. I would be the primary target, and it would be hard to end well. Conversely... if I investigate inward, I only need to face the real culprit behind the scenes, most likely He Wentian. The resistance would be much smaller."

Li Xian clasped his hands: "Elders, you are willing to accompany me on this冒险, I am truly grateful!"

Ye Cheng and Tang Wenshu were both members of the Candle Sect, so they were relatively trustworthy. Tang Wenshu said: "Where, where, it's also for survival." Ye Cheng said: "As the saying goes, the outside is strong but the inside is weak. Blindly fleeing outward is like hitting a copper wall. Sometimes, going the opposite way offers more hope. I agree with Brother Li's plan."

Li Xian said: "Those women disappeared here; there must be something suspicious. It's laughable that the elders and disciples of the five great sword sects have maggots in their heads; no one suspects."

Ye Cheng said: "Don't say that. First, our Flower Cage Sect does have a notorious reputation. Second, that City Lord He has too good a reputation. Whoever comes would inevitably blame it on us."

Li Xian murmured: "Now they have already blamed it on me. I am truly wronged. What ability do I have to capture all these heroines?"

The three disguised themselves as ordinary merchants and walked into the House of Unspoken Sorrows with composure. The House of Unspoken Sorrows was a place for pleasure, with fine wine and delicious food served. Ye Cheng and Tang Wenshu spent money and effort to book a private room and ordered more than ten dishes extravagantly.

Li Xian observed along the way and found that the House of Unspoken Sorrows had many hidden mechanisms and extremely complex secret traps. After sitting down in the private room, Li Xian said in a low voice: "Elders, there are many eyes and ears here, it's inconvenient to act together. Why not separate? I will go first. If I find any clues, I will use the hair to notify you." He took down six strands of hair and gave them to the two respectively.

Ye Cheng sighed: "Brother Li's ability is really extremely useful. But pulling them out like this, won't this full head of black hair be insufficient?"

Li Xian smiled: "You don't need to worry about that. My hair is extremely abundant." He transported filth, refined his five organs, nourished his blood and promoted hair growth, which was very easy.

Li Xian slipped away quietly and潜行 towards the pavilion where the "Phoenix Banquet" was held. The interior of the House of Unspoken Sorrows was deep and far, the whole body was blood-red, and the paint was "Zhensha Paint," often used on coffins.

The venue for the Phoenix Banquet was very spacious. There was a large round platform in the middle, surrounded by a circle of white jade tables. In the center of the platform was a wooden pavilion with a very strange shape, built purely from "wooden chairs," "wooden sticks," and other debris. The pavilion was not fixed with mortise and tenon, and the structure was extremely loose; it could be kicked down with one foot.

And it was very crooked. Looking up from below, it twisted east, slanted west, tilted north, and拐弯 south. It was extremely奇特, but it never collapsed.

Presumably, when the Phoenix Banquet was held, the women were playing a "building blocks" competition. They used items around them to throw onto the platform, making the wood pile up into a pavilion, and then gradually added wood to raise the "wooden pavilion." Finally, they saw who had poorer martial arts, causing the wooden pavilion to collapse.

Every piece of wood in this pavilion contained martial arts intent that had not dissipated for a long time. So its appearance was strange, contrary to reason, but it never collapsed. Li Xian observed for a long time and secretly thought: "Martial arts can reflect one's temperament. These women were either reserved or passionate or other, playing very happily. And their martial arts were not weak. Among them, a few had extremely considerable ability. Why would they disappear without reason?"

Just as he was thinking, he suddenly heard footsteps approaching. A pair of gilded silver tiger boots stepped into this place. Li Xian hid his position and looked over, wondering: "How could it be her?" A woman he was very familiar with had come here!
