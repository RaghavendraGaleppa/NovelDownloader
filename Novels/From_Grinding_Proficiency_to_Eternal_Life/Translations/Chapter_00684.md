# Chapter 684: Senior Sister, Isn't It Time to Make Your Move?

Fear overwhelmed rage.

Tong Xuan Zhenjun no longer had any will to fight, not even daring to leave behind any parting threats.

Xu Yunfan's attack made him see clearly that the other party already had a foundation in this realm. To kill the two Wai Dao Zhenjun, this great realm even bestowed a blessing the moment Xu Yunfan attacked, allowing his Thunder Godhead to ascend in rank and truly govern the authority of thunder.

Since Chi Yang was already dead, if Tong Xuan stayed any longer, his fate would be no different. This realm was not the Taihua Lingxu Realm.

He wouldn't even be able to achieve reincarnation.

In an instant, the nine invisible Sword Souls, covered in cracks, merged into one, erupting with their final power to forcibly tear through the vines entangling the Nature God, and burning the origin of his Dao Core recklessly.

"Tian Ji Breaks Void, Escape!"

A dark and distorted Sword Light wrapped around Tong Xuan Zhenjun. His body and sword became one, transforming into a thin line that severed the Void, fleeing desperately towards the direction of the realm barrier.

His speed was far faster than when he arrived.

"Trying to leave?!"

Xu Yunfan had just suppressed the violently throbbing Chi Yang Dao Core in his hand. Seeing Tong Xuan attempting to escape, how could he be willing to let him go?

He was about to activate the Star Spirit Banner to block him.

Just at this moment, a cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes as he shouted sternly towards the Void ahead of Tong Xuan Zhenjun's escape route.

"Dongming Shijie! If not now, when will you make your move?!"

A deep sigh echoed from the depths of the Void.

Nine Nether Evil Mist churned silently, and the figure of Dongming Zhenjun in her black Daoist robe materialized from the twisting shadows.

A hint of helplessness flashed across her devastatingly beautiful face; she clearly knew that her concealment had long been seen through by Xu Yunfan, leading to this current situation.

The dark light in her eyes swirled as she locked onto Tong Xuan's fleeing light.

Her jade fingers formed a seal, and the power of the Nine Abyss Black Evil Dao Core erupted violently.

"Nine Nether Abyss, Cause and Effect Inversion."

An invisible ripple spread from her as the Void before Tong Xuan Zhenjun's escape path suddenly collapsed and reconstructed.

The trajectory that should have led straight to the realm barrier was forcibly twisted into a Möbius ring-like shape where the beginning and end connected. The laws of space, under the interference of her insight into all thoughts, transformed into a cage.

Tong Xuan felt his Divine Sense shudder. Although the realm barrier was right before him, his Sword Soul's flight was merely spinning in place.

This was the most uncanny technique of the Nine Abyss Black Evil: the Eternal Corridor.

Using Cause and Effect techniques to trap someone to death.

Only then did Dongming Zhenjun turn her gaze to Xu Yunfan, her eyes flowing with suspicion.

"Good手段, Junior Brother Xu! This Seat considered my Nine Nether Escape Technique to have reached the ultimate realm; even Senior Brother Pudu would find it hard to detect. How did you see through it?"

She pursed her red lips. The golden divine blood on her Black Evil Daoist robe, not yet dry, flickered with her breathing, clearly showing that her injuries from the battle in the Aeterra Realm had not yet healed.

However, Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't believe Dongming Zhenjun's appearance.

Women are the best liars, especially beautiful ones.

"Senior Sister, why the feigned surprise? As a disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect, you wouldn't stop until you achieved your goal. You gave up the Primordial Yin deposit and coveted the Nightfall Dao Core to harmonize your own Nine Abyss Black Evil; how could you be willing to return empty-handed?"

The Chi Yang Dao Core in Xu Yunfan's palm was still throbbing violently, tightly suppressed by a purple-gold thunder net.

"Moreover, the Dongming Erosion Heaven Talisman you cultivate is the same source as my Great Perfection level secret technique; we could feel the resonance even from a hundred miles away."

Xu Yunfan's movements were extremely eye-catching to Dongming Zhenjun. The other party's undisguised greed made a flash of coldness pass through Xu Yunfan's eyes.

Dongming Zhenjun sighed: "It's a pity. If I didn't cultivate the Nine Abyss Black Evil, which is the Dao of Cause and Effect, this Chi Yang Dao Core would be a universal treasure that many people want."

Xu Yunfan met Dongming's gaze, the corner of his mouth curling into an arc of understanding.

"Senior Sister wants this Dao Core? For your Nine Abyss Black Evil, the Chi Yang Dao Core belongs to Yin and Yang. If you could achieve Dragon and Tiger harmony and the mutual nourishment of Yin and Yang, you might even use it to enter the mid-stage of Golden Core."

Dongming Zhenjun's pupils contracted sharply, but her expression quickly returned to normal.

Xu Yunfan had not only seen through her intention to lie in wait, but also pointed out the depth of her Cause and Effect secret technique, and furthermore, he clearly knew the attributes of her Nine Abyss Black Evil Dao Core.

These words were already an open discussion.

In one sentence: if she couldn't get the Nightfall Dao Core, she would definitely find a way to ambush Xu Yunfan to seize the Chi Yang Dao Core.

Unfortunately, now that she had been seen through, the various thoughts in her heart had to be temporarily suppressed.

This boy's insight into the behavior of Primordial Origin Sect Zhenjun had reached a depth that was令人发指 (terrifying).

She suppressed the churning evil mist, her voice carrying a solemnity she had never had before.

"Senior Brother Shenxiao, you are a hundred times more difficult to deal with than Qingyuan."

"Roar!"

The Tong Xuan Zhenjun, trapped by Dongming Zhenjun, now let out a sword-chant-like roar.

At this moment, he naturally knew he had fallen into a realm of distorted Cause and Effect.

In the next instant, the Xuan Shu Sword Soul Dao Core shook violently, and the nine invisible Sword Souls merged into one instantly, transforming into a towering Sword Intent that severed fate.

The will refined by a Golden Core Sword Cultivator throughout his life erupted at this moment, actually tearing a gap in the twisted Cause and Effect cage.

"A mere heart-confusing technique, how can it trap me?!"

The Sword Light rose again, charging straight for the gap.

Dongming Zhenjun muffled a groan and retreated, her Black Evil Daoist robe cut open by the invisible Sword Intent in several places.

She didn't dare to be negligent; Tong Xuan Zhenjun's Sword Intent was coming straight for her face.

She quickly formed a seal, and the Nine Nether Evil Mist condensed into a玄冥 Bone Hand to grab the Sword Light, her tone unusually anxious.

"The will of a Sword Cultivator is as hard as iron, best at countering Cause and Effect secret techniques. Junior Brother Xu, aren't you going to make a move?!"

However, Xu Yunfan only strengthened the seal on the Chi Yang Dao Core, his expression indifferent.

"Senior Sister accepted the coordinates of the Aeterra Realm as a deposit and also wants the Dark Dao Core; you should show some sincerity."

Xu Yunfan had no intention of making a move. At this moment, he was suppressing the Chi Yang Dao Core he had seized, and furthermore, Dongming Zhenjun had been hiding all along to get what she wanted; how could such a good thing exist in the world?

Thunder light flowed around him, clearly watching from the sidelines.

"This beast's Dao Foundation is already damaged. If Senior Sister can't even take him down, you probably have no缘分 with the Nightfall Dao Core."

Hearing this, Dongming almost lost her composure and wanted to curse.

The Zhenjun of the Primordial Origin Sect were truly becoming more and more shameless one by one.

But she also knew clearly that if she didn't provide some proof of loyalty, how could such a good deal exist in the world, relying solely on Primordial Yin to exchange for a Dao Core?

Dongming Zhenjun naturally knew Xu Yunfan's meaning and didn't hesitate. She began to exert her full strength to fight a desperate struggle with the dying Tong Xuan Zhenjun.

Both were Wai Dao Zhenjun, not registered in Aeterra, so the fight was naturally extremely difficult. However, because Tong Xuan Zhenjun had fought consecutive battles with Xu Yunfan and the Three Great Gods, Dongming Zhenjun was resting and waiting, and moreover, those who became Zhenjun in the Primordial Origin Sect were not simple characters.

Sword Cultivators were considered invincible in the same realm by those mid and low-level sects, but for geniuses like them, there were naturally ways to deal with them.

Dongming's eyes churned with evil aura, and her black palace-style robe moved without wind.

Nine Abyss Evil Mist transformed into billions of ghosts, screaming as they pounced on the Sword Light. Every strand of evil mist contained the power to侵蚀 (erode) the weaknesses of the human heart.

Tong Xuan's Sword Soul charged left and right; where it passed, the ghosts were annihilated and then reborn, like maggots in a bone.

As a Sword Dao Zhenjun, Tong Xuan's will had naturally been refined into a Sword Intent. He sensed something was wrong immediately and displayed his refined Tong Xuan Sword Intent to break through the Cause and Effect technique.
