# Chapter 81: A Hidden Pearl?

Senior Brother Li's heart sank as a bitter smile appeared on his face. "Senior Brother, you already know about it?" he asked quietly.

Xie Yu's expression remained unchanged. "What's his name?"

"Zhang Jing," Senior Brother Li hurriedly explained. "Senior Brother might not know, but Junior Brother Zhang Jing has extraordinary cultivation talent. In just a few months since entering the Dao Academy and beginning his cultivation, he's already reached the sixth level of Qi Refinement."

"Zhang Jing..." Xie Yu murmured, his eyes flickering thoughtfully.

After a moment of contemplation, he looked back at Senior Brother Li. "So you believe this Junior Brother Zhang can reach the tenth level of Qi Refinement within a year and a half to enter the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven?"

Xie Yu saw right through Senior Brother Li's intentions—he wanted to forcibly elevate a disciple generally regarded as second-class talent to first-class status. This way, the Luodu team could boast a "first-class" member, keeping pace with the other two teams, while also using this achievement to improve their overall ranking.

Still, Xie Yu had to admit that his junior brother had a sharp eye for talent. A faint, unreadable glint flashed in his eyes as he seemed to recall something.

Opposite him, Senior Brother Li nodded solemnly. "It's worth a try. If Junior Brother Zhang manages to reach the tenth level before the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven opens, you know what that would mean—"

"But you violated the academy's rules," Xie Yu interrupted.

"Senior Brother, this is the Luodu team's chance!" Senior Brother Li retorted, staring firmly at Xie Yu without backing down, despite the difference in their statuses as outer and inner court disciples.

The room fell into heavy silence.

As the pressure mounted, a trace of pleading appeared in Senior Brother Li's eyes.

Then, suddenly, Xie Yu broke into a broad smile, dispelling the tension in the room. "Haha! We didn't misjudge you, and it seems you haven't misjudged your junior brother either!"

The abrupt shift caught Senior Brother Li off guard. "Senior Brother, what do you mean by that? How have I not misjudged him? Have you met Junior Brother Zhang already?" His voice trembled with excitement.

Clearly, Senior Brother Xie wasn't going to hold his rule-breaking against him—and his words suggested he shared his high opinion of Zhang Jing!

"Junior Brother Yuanxing, your Junior Brother Zhang Jing isn't as simple as you think," Xie Yu said meaningfully. "About half a month ago, he came to the Inheritance Pavilion to exchange for a top-grade cultivation method. It only occurred to me now when you mentioned his name."

"A top-grade inheritance?! How did he get so many Dao Merits?" Senior Brother Li was stunned.

"The boy must have encountered a great opportunity," Xie Yu mused. "But that's not important. The fact that he dared to spend a fortune on a top-grade cultivation method, knowing the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven is about to open, suggests one thing—"

"Compatibility!" Senior Brother Li exclaimed. "Junior Brother Zhang must have known in advance that his compatibility with that method was extremely high. Otherwise, he could have used those nine thousand Dao Merits to buy resources to push himself to the tenth level of Qi Refinement. I already explained the importance of the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven to him—he wouldn't willingly miss it."

"Exactly. That was my thought as well. At least three chi of compatibility would justify such a decision. Tsk tsk, talent like that isn't far from first-class." Xie Yu smirked.

A hidden pearl? This pearl might be bigger than expected.

Regaining his composure, Xie Yu turned to Senior Brother Li with a serious expression. "Junior Brother, I need you to confirm with Zhang Jing—does his compatibility with that top-grade method truly reach three chi? If it does..."

"Keep it quiet. Increase his resources discreetly, matching what we give the two first-class disciples. I'll cover for you to ensure the Inspection Pavilion doesn't notice. And remind Zhang Jing to keep a low profile, as before."

"Senior Brother, are you planning to—?" Senior Brother Li looked at him thoughtfully.

Xie Yu chuckled. "Once Zhang Jing reaches the tenth level of Qi Refinement, he should come directly to our Inheritance Pavilion. No need to involve the other departments in such a minor matter. What do you think, Junior Brother?"

"And the Luodu team?"

"Don't worry about that, Junior Brother."

Once outside the Inheritance Pavilion and sure no one was around, Senior Brother Li could no longer contain his excitement and burst into laughter. The gloom that had weighed on him these past days vanished entirely.

Just when things seemed bleak, a new path had opened. Who would have thought Junior Brother Zhang would accomplish something so significant without fanfare? But since Senior Brother Xie insisted on secrecy, he would comply.

When the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven opened, Zhang Jing would give the Panlong and Yanxia teams a real "surprise"!

Remembering Xie Yu's instructions, Senior Brother Li suppressed his excitement and transformed into a streak of light, speeding toward Luodu Island.

Soon, he arrived outside Zhang Jing's cave abode. Just as he was about to send a message inside, he hesitated. Zhang Jing was likely cultivating, and interrupting might disrupt his progress. Since Zhang Jing would seek him out in ten days anyway, he could wait until then to ask. Meanwhile, he could plan which resources would best aid Zhang Jing's cultivation.

After reaching the later stages of Qi Refinement, Water Essence Pills had become far less effective. A different type of spirit pill was needed.

With Senior Brother Xie's assurance, Senior Brother Li felt unshackled and ready to act more boldly.

Half a month later, inside his cave abode, Zhang Jing surveyed the table piled high with talismans, satisfaction gleaming in his eyes. Though ninety-nine percent were low-grade, their sheer quantity was impressive. He hadn't counted them all, but selling them for two thousand Dao Merits wouldn't be a problem.

Moreover, he had produced these talismans during breaks in his cultivation without slowing his progress—though this was partly because he hadn't obtained many demon cores recently. Without demon cores or spirit herbs, relying solely on absorbing ambient spiritual energy, even in his richly saturated cave, his cultivation speed was frustratingly slow.

For Zhang Jing, it made more sense to focus on talisman-making than to grind through sluggish cultivation. As long as he had resources, his strength could grow rapidly.

With that thought, he stored the talismans and headed out—to sell them, earn Dao Merits, and buy resources.

Passing the spirit herb chamber, he noticed Deer Thirty-Eight with its rump in the air, front hooves planted on the ground as it meticulously tended to the herbs. Zhang Jing quietly stepped past, not wanting to disturb it.

Let Deer Thirty-Eight keep its hopes up. In truth, Dao Merits couldn't buy it a cultivation method—the academy's inheritances weren't available to spirit beasts, at least not in the outer court. Zhang Jing guessed he'd have to wait until entering the inner court before finding a way to secure one for the deer.

At the Merit Pavilion, Zhang Jing stared in surprise at the twenty-plus demon cores in his hand.

"Senior Brother Zhang," the junior sister at the counter explained with an amused expression, "after you and those alchemists drove up prices, many disciples went out hunting water-attribute demons. But when they returned, those alchemists had already withdrawn their purchase requests, so they had no choice but to sell the cores to you at standard prices."

Zhang Jing stored the cores and handed over his identity token. "Junior Sister, keep the task open. Deposit two thousand Dao Merits this time."

"Understood, Senior Brother."

Half an hour later, inside Luodu Tower.

"Junior Brother, please have a seat!" Senior Brother Li greeted him with unusual enthusiasm, his eyes shining and a wide smile on his face.

"Thank you, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied stiffly, taken aback. Never before had he seen Senior Brother Li behave this way. A nervous flutter rose in his chest.
