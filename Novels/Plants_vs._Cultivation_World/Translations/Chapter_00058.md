# Chapter 58: Second-Stage Sunflower

"Senior Sister Yuan, you're not a water spiritual root, so the Water Spirit Rice has limited effect on you. As for its ability to nourish meridians and physique, do you really think it could compare to my perfected-level Cleansing Technique?" Gu Mo said somewhat helplessly.

"Oh, that's true."

Hearing Gu Mo's words, Yuan Niya found them reasonable. "Junior Brother Gu Mo, then give me the super-enhanced version of the Cleansing Technique this time. Your senior sister is preparing to break through to the third level of Qi Refinement."

"So soon!"

Gu Mo looked at Yuan Niya in surprise. She had only recently broken through to the second level of Qi Refinement, yet she was already aiming for the third. As expected of an inner sect disciple—her talent was truly enviable.

"Then, Senior Sister, are you prepared?"

A faint smile appeared at the corner of Gu Mo's lips. The super-enhanced version of the Cleansing Technique was no easy experience.

"Hah, what's a little pain? If enduring some suffering could lead to improvement on the path of cultivation, countless people would gladly embrace it." Yuan Niya's tone carried a note of determination. Her obsession with becoming stronger was unwavering.

As a child, because of her black-and-red hair, she had often been bullied, and beatings were a common occurrence. As she grew older, whenever someone bullied her, she would fight back without hesitation, often leaving herself covered in wounds.

Pain had been a constant companion throughout Yuan Niya's childhood. Thus, she did not fear pain—what she feared was being too weak.

"Hmm!"

As soon as Yuan Niya finished speaking, she let out a pained groan. Gu Mo's super-enhanced Cleansing Technique had already taken effect. With his true cultivation at the fourth level of Qi Refinement, the potency of his enhanced technique was undoubtedly at its peak.

But Yuan Niya, true to her words, gritted her teeth and endured the intense meridian- and marrow-cleansing effects of the enhanced technique. Normally, the cleansing process would feel comfortable, but when amplified several times over, it became akin to torture.

By the time the Cleansing Technique ended, Yuan Niya had collapsed onto the ground, her clothes stained with patches of blood—impurities expelled by the super-enhanced cleansing. This was proof of the technique's efficacy, though the price was suffering far beyond the norm.

"Turn around."

Yuan Niya spoke weakly.

Gu Mo turned away, and soon the sound of her changing clothes reached his ears. Last time, when she had returned with bloodstained clothes, her master had questioned her thoroughly. This time, she had come prepared with a spare set.

After all, she had promised Gu Mo to keep this secret.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, if you ever run into trouble, come find your senior sister anytime." Having regained some strength while changing, Yuan Niya took advantage of the night to leave Gu Mo's spirit fields.

With Yuan Niya gone, Gu Mo's life finally settled back into peace. Time passed swiftly in this tranquility.

"Finally, just a little more left."

Holding fourteen portions of Solar Essence in his hand, Gu Mo stood before the cultivation pot. Inside it, a first-stage, top-grade Sunflower swayed gently. On its attribute screen, the large upgrade arrow was almost entirely green, with only the very tip still unfilled.

To fill that last sliver, another half-year had passed since Gu Mo had replanted the Water Spirit Rice. Today was the day he would finally complete the upgrade.

Without hesitation, Gu Mo poured the fourteen portions of Solar Essence into the pot. The green upgrade arrow emitted a faint glow as the last blank space was filled. Now, all he had to do was tap the arrow to elevate the first-stage, top-grade Sunflower to the second stage.

In total, Gu Mo had spent a year's worth of Solar Essence on this endeavor. Had he used it all for cultivation, he estimated he could have risen directly from the fourth to the sixth level of Qi Refinement.

Advancing two minor realms in a single year would have been no issue at all. Were it not for the bottleneck between mid- and late-stage cultivation, a year's worth of Solar Essence might even have propelled him to the seventh or eighth level of Qi Refinement.

But having invested so much, it was now time to reap the rewards.

Without delay, Gu Mo tapped the green upgrade arrow. Instantly, the Sunflower in the pot was enveloped in a radiant glow that lasted for about half a quarter-hour. When the light faded, the Sunflower had undergone a subtle transformation.

The change was not in its appearance—the upgraded Sunflower looked much the same as before. The most significant difference lay in its flower disc, which resembled a miniature sun. Now, faint golden runes could be glimpsed within it.

After observing the upgraded Sunflower, Gu Mo focused his mind to check its attributes, verifying whether it had truly reached the second stage.

**Name:** Sunflower  
**Grade:** Second-stage, low-grade  
**Effect:** Condenses Solar Essence  
**Planting Condition:** Second-stage spirit field  

Seeing the words "Second-stage, low-grade," Gu Mo's face broke into a smile. Moreover, there was still an upgrade arrow visible afterward. However, Gu Mo had no intention of upgrading it further—who knew how much Solar Essence would be needed to raise it from low-grade to mid-grade?

---

That would have to wait until Gu Mo had upgraded all his remaining Sunflowers to the second stage before he even considered it.

But his smile vanished the moment he saw the planting condition. To plant a second-stage Sunflower, a second-stage spirit field was required.

Where was he supposed to find a second-stage spirit field now? The Green Dew Sect certainly had them—even third-stage fields existed—but those were far beyond his current reach.

After all the effort to upgrade the Sunflower to the second stage, if he couldn't plant it due to insufficient field quality, wouldn't this past year have been wasted?

Unwilling to accept this, Gu Mo transplanted the second-stage Sunflower from the pot back into his spirit field. He wouldn't give up without trying.

The second-stage Sunflower did not revert to seed form after being planted, meaning it could survive—and function—in a first-stage spirit field. This discovery delighted Gu Mo.

After waiting a day, as night fell, Gu Mo approached the second-stage Sunflower. Now, its flower disc held a concentrated mass of Solar Essence, clearly of a fundamentally different quality from that produced by first-stage Sunflowers.

He chose to harvest it. A smaller, illusory sun appeared, dotted with golden specks of light.

From this, Gu Mo concluded that while a second-stage spirit field was undoubtedly the optimal environment for a second-stage Sunflower, a first-stage field could still sustain it and allow it to produce Solar Essence—albeit not in its perfect state.

Even so, the Solar Essence condensed by a second-stage Sunflower was fundamentally superior to that of the first-stage. Next, Gu Mo planned to absorb this second-stage Solar Essence to experience the difference firsthand.
