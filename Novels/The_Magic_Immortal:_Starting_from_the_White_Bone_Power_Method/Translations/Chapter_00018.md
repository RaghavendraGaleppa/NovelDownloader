# Chapter 18: The Vajra Talisman

After ten breaths,  
Ning Jingming ceased his incantation.  

The fierce winds swirling around the jade bed, formed by the overflow of magical power, gradually subsided.  

The eerie [Bone-Corroding Yin Wind] patterns that had marred the white-robed man's face had vanished without a trace. Instead, Wang Chan's needle-restriction patterns now twisted like wrinkles across the man's refined features, lending his handsome face an oddly distorted appearance.  

"Ah, what relief," the white-robed man exhaled deeply, releasing a turbid breath.  

"Brother Wang, please withdraw your needle restrictions," Ning Jingming clasped his hands respectfully toward Wang Chan.  

Wang Chan gave a slight nod and flicked his sleeve. Five silver needles, glowing with a withered yellow light, flew back into his sleeve and disappeared.  

At first, the onlookers had merely thought Wang Chan was good-looking.  

But now, observing the effortless confidence in his movements, his understated grace, and his extraordinary aura, they couldn't help but sense an air of profound mystery about him.  

Qi Yizhi, in particular, bit her red lips unconsciously, her bright eyes twinkling like stars.  

Seeing that Wang Chan had successfully retrieved his needles, Ning Jingming inspected the white-robed man once more before finally relaxing. "Brother Zhao, you should rest for a while. I'll prepare a medicinal bath to treat your remaining injuries."  

With that, he led Qi Yizhi and the other two physicians out of the room to make arrangements.  

Wang Chan, still eager to collect his payment and return home, clasped his hands toward the white-robed man. "I must take my leave now, as I have matters to attend to."  

"Brother Wang, please wait," the white-robed man said, rising with the support of the two women. He clasped his fists firmly. "I am Zhao Shanhe, an outer disciple of the Hundred Talismans Sect."  

"Wang Chan, a rogue cultivator," Wang Chan replied, slightly surprised.  

This disciple of a major sect wasn't as haughty and overbearing as people made them out to be.  

"Your needle-restriction technique is truly astounding, Brother Wang. It's my good fortune to have met such a skilled healer upon arriving in the White Mountain City region." Zhao Shanhe patted his storage pouch and retrieved a jade box, handing it to Wang Chan.  

"This is a mid-grade Vajra Talisman I crafted, containing twenty-nine layers of restriction seals. Its defensive capabilities are passable—I hope you won't find it unworthy."  

"Brother Zhao's generosity is overwhelming. I wouldn't dare refuse," Wang Chan said after a brief hesitation, accepting the gift.  

Zhao Shanhe was not only handsome but also exceptionally gracious, leaving Wang Chan with a greatly improved impression of him.  

The man was both humble and magnanimous.  

In Wang Chan's understanding, the Vajra Talisman was one of the five great defensive talismans in the cultivation world.  

Moreover, the mid-grade talisman Zhao Shanhe had gifted him, with its twenty-nine layers of restriction seals, was a gesture of genuine sincerity.  

Such an item—let alone a mid-grade one—couldn't be found anywhere in the Black River Market, not even in the White Mountain City's bazaars.  

In terms of value, a mid-grade talisman typically started at thirty spirit coins, and for something like the Vajra Talisman, fifty wouldn't be excessive.  

With twenty-nine restriction seals, each additional layer added three spirit coins to its worth.  

Given its rarity, the talisman in Wang Chan's hands could easily fetch a hundred and fifty spirit coins, with buyers clamoring for it.  

At this realization, Wang Chan's hand trembled imperceptibly, stunned by the other man's extravagance.  

Still, he had essentially saved Zhao Shanhe's life, so such a generous reward was only fitting. There was no harm in accepting it.  

He chided himself inwardly for his lack of composure—receiving a single mid-grade Vajra Talisman had nearly unsettled him. His mental fortitude still needed tempering.  

For someone like him now, possessing a mid-grade Vajra Talisman meant unparalleled security. He could travel home without fear of ambushes from demonic beasts or vengeful spirits.  

However, leaving immediately after receiving such a lavish gift would be impolite. It would be better to chat for another half-cup of tea's time before departing.  

He could afford the delay—he'd just have to run faster later.  

But as they conversed, Wang Chan was startled to learn something unexpected.  

Several months ago, Blackwater City—located over four hundred thousand miles north of the White Mountain Range—had been besieged by a monstrous tide and a ghostly surge. The city had fallen, forcing countless cultivators to flee.  

Blackwater City was a third-tier cultivation city, defended by a Yin God True Monarch and a third-tier formation. Moreover, it was under the jurisdiction of the Green Sun Sect, one of the seven great sects.  

What kind of monstrous and ghostly tide could possibly breach such defenses?  

Zhao Shanhe and his two companions had been training in Blackwater City when disaster struck. In haste, they boarded a southbound flying vessel and sought refuge in White Mountain City.  

Though White Mountain City was only a second-tier cultivation city under the Cloud Mist Sect—the foremost of the seven great sects—it was sufficient for their training.  

After chatting for a while, Zhao Shanhe noticed Wang Chan's eagerness to leave and said, "Brother Wang, if you have urgent matters, don't let me detain you. Should you visit White Mountain City in the future, feel free to call on me at the Mystic Talisman Pavilion."  

Wang Chan nodded and took his leave. As he stepped out, he couldn't help but feel a pang of envy.  

These elite sect disciples, with their prestigious backgrounds, could come and go from White Mountain City as they pleased, staying as long as they wished. Meanwhile, rogue cultivators like him, lacking late-stage Qi Refinement cultivation or notable status, had no chance of settling there to cultivate.  

"We rogue cultivators must strive harder," Wang Chan sighed.  

Returning to the courtyard, he found Ning Jingming, as usual, watching ants crawl beneath the jujube tree.  

Spotting Wang Chan, Ning Jingming's dark, homely face twisted into a smile uglier than a grimace. He handed Wang Chan a jade pouch.  

"The payment was forty spirit coins—we'll split it evenly."  

"Brother Ning, this is too much..."  

Wang Chan made a token protest, pretending to return the pouch while gripping it tightly.  

"This is only fair. Please accept it," Ning Jingming said with a deep bow. "I owe you a debt of gratitude for your help today."  

Though Ning Jingming's dark, unattractive face was initially off-putting, his earnest demeanor and righteous aura now made Wang Chan regard him with newfound respect.  

If only he had a crescent moon on his forehead, the image would be complete, Wang Chan mused.  

"You honor me too much, Brother Ning," Wang Chan replied solemnly.  

"Come by for tea sometime—we can exchange medical insights."  

"I'd be delighted. I look forward to your guidance. Farewell!"  

"Safe travels, Brother Wang."  

Ning Jingming escorted Wang Chan to the gate, watching until his figure vanished into the distant stone-paved alley.

As dusk settled,  

Wang Chan lurked in the dense forest along the mountain path leading from Black River Market to Lotus Mountain—the only route back.  

Before leaving the market, he had stealthily purchased twenty bottles of [Spirit Nourishing Elixir] from Shopkeeper Hu's store in separate transactions. Though slightly conspicuous, it was a necessary risk.  

With the additional twenty spirit coins from Ning Jingming and his own savings, he could afford them.  

Given the influx of refugees from fallen Blackwater City, the elixir's price might soon double. It was better to stock up now—not just for cost, but to avoid shortages that could hinder his cultivation.  

With today's gains and over fifty bottles of [Spirit Nourishing Elixir] secured, Wang Chan was satisfied.  

However, he had also spotted Tang Song shopping in the market.  

Leaving swiftly, he raced ahead and hid along the mountain path, concealing two [Minor Withering Needles] in each hand, ready to ambush Tang Song if he passed by.  

But as night fell, Tang Song still hadn't appeared.  

After waiting a while longer, Wang Chan abandoned the ambush and resumed his journey, reaching Lotus Mountain before the last light faded.  

Instead of returning to his cave dwelling, he detoured to Cave No. 81—only to find it dark and empty.  

"Did that bastard go whoring? I'll have to come back early tomorrow and try again."
