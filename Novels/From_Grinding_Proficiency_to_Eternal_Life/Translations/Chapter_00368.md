# Chapter 368: Treachery and Counter-Treachery

"It seems you prefer to be refined into lamp oil."

In his palm, a furnace phantom constructed from Ten Extremes True Qi rose. His vital energy surged, using his own body as the furnace to transmit scorching heat, causing the phantom furnace to heat up rapidly.

Such a luxurious use of True Qi to manifest forms was something only Xu Yunfan would do.

The Purple Gold Core of Youquan trembled violently: "Wait! I might have remembered two crucial points incorrectly just now..."

It frantically reorganized the incantation, this time deliberately adding three segments of obscure terms at the connection point between the "Foot Shaoyang Meridian" and the "Hand Jueyin Meridian."

Xu Yunfan watched impassively as his attribute panel finally flashed a prompt.

*'You have obtained a incomplete Hundred Meridians Nether Art, but the most critical key points seem to be missing.'*

Xu Yunfan immediately simulated the Buddhist Demon Suppression Seal with his Ten Extremes True Qi, heavily wrapping the demonic energy sphere.

"This is the third mistake. If you make another error or omit something, I'll make you stay in the Divine Martial Realm for eternity."

Xu Yunfan's voice made Youquan feel as if plunged into an ice cellar.

Once truly killed by Xu Yunfan, without a true master from outside capturing his soul, he could only sink in this small Divine Martial Realm for ten thousand lifetimes, never to see the light of day again.

When the Purple Gold Core was burned by Pure Yang True Fire down to the size of a walnut, Youquan finally broke down and roared out the complete incantation.

This time, the attribute panel flickered violently and popped up a message.

*'You are comprehending the Yuan Origin Sect's secret art, Hundred Meridians Nether Art, but some places seem unclear.'*

With this information prompt, many insights about the Hundred Meridians Nether Art suddenly arose in Xu Yunfan's mind, along with some previously elusive techniques and obscure terms.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes and continued to ask questions.

Youquan dared not hesitate and continued to answer.

Until a message finally appeared on Xu Yunfan's attribute panel.

*'You are comprehending the Hundred Meridians Nether Art, and seem to have a sudden realization, feeling that a new door to cultivation has been opened.'*

Not to mention the Extinction Dust Heart Sutra, just the cultivation method of the Hundred Meridians Nether Art alone opened Xu Yunfan's eyes.

This Yuan Demon Sect secret art uses vital energy as its foundation. It requires using the Opening Meridian Pill as a guide at the intersection of flesh and blood to nurture a nether organ that exists between energy and flesh.

Once this organ forms, it will gradually derive a complex network of meridians, spreading like vines throughout the four limbs and hundred bones, ultimately constructing a special meridian system capable of accommodating true essence.

The entire process takes a long time, but once completed, it can reshape the cultivator's innate meridian structure.

At that time, when one's Ten Extremes True Qi is infused, knowing how to cultivate properly, it naturally transforms true qi into true essence, thus embarking on the path of cultivation.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath and asked: "How does one jump out of this realm?"

Youquan said: "Three days from now, Yuan Origin Sect disciples will descend upon the Divine Martial Realm. You just need to kill one, use their form to hide your own, and employ the method of the cuckoo taking over the magpie's nest to blend out. With the Yuan Origin Token in hand, the supervising true master will absolutely not interfere in this matter."

"You are fellow sect disciples, yet you sound quite cold-hearted?"

Xu Yunfan asked casually, his tone seemingly offhand.

Youquan's demonic core trembled, and after a moment of silence, it let out a bitter voice: "Unless one reaches Foundation Establishment, in the eyes of the Yuan Origin Sect, whether outer sect disciples or true transmission disciples, all are merely consumable materials to be used at will."

Speaking of this, Youquan couldn't help but sigh: "Otherwise... how could we be willing to take such risks, coming to this Divine Martial Realm to fight for a future? The path of immortality is difficult, and with the slightest carelessness, one faces eternal damnation. We are merely struggling to climb, hoping that one day we can establish a foundation and escape the label of demonic sect consumables..."

Xu Yunfan's eyes suddenly flashed with golden light; he instantly caught a key piece of information that Youquan had rarely let slip.

His five fingers suddenly tightened, and the Pure Yang True Qi turned into a fine golden net that dug into the Purple Gold Core: "You mean, there is something for Foundation Establishment hidden within the Divine Martial Realm?"

Youquan let out a piercing shriek as the demonic energy was burned with a sizzling sound.

He now completely understood that the monster before him, who had just entered the Land Immortal realm of martial arts, not only possessed formidable strength but also had terrifying insight.

Any concealment would invite disaster. If he didn't speak, he feared he would lose his life in the next second.

After all, other Yuan Demon Sect disciples would descend in three days. Xu Yunfan completely didn't need to keep him alive. With the other party's strength, he could easily capture someone else to interrogate.

"I'll say!" Youquan's demonic core flashed frantically. "The [Martial Dao Profound Crystal] nurtured by this world's heavens is a rare treasure!"

Youquan's demonic core trembled violently, his speech speed as rapid as pouring beans. Countless tiny runes floated in the demonic energy, as if trying desperately to prove the truth of his words.

"This item requires a martial artist at the extreme realm of martial arts—what you call a Land Immortal realm martial arts expert—as a guide. It must draw the Profound Yellow Qi into one's own spirit and condense it for a hundred days to forge a [Divine Martial Foundation Platform]! Only the 'Divine Martial True Master' who passed down the foundation of martial arts a thousand years ago has successfully walked this path. For the past thousand years, no one has succeeded! Since this position is vacant, we naturally want to fight for it. If we succeed, we might even be able to use it to seek the Golden Core Great Dao."

Xu Yunfan's Martial Dao Heavenly Eye throbbed violently, determining that what Youquan said was true.

Seeing this, Youquan thought Xu Yunfan was about to torture him again and hurriedly added, a trace of awe actually seeping through the demonic energy: "In the Yuan Origin Sect's history, only three true transmission disciples have found similar strange items in the Taihua Spirit Void Realm. But among those who achieved Foundation Establishment, only that Divine Martial True Master..."

It suddenly lowered its fluctuation: "But three thousand years ago, he entered the 'Profoud Yellow Reincarnation Well', so this Dao Base remains vacant! Since this position is vacant, we naturally want to fight for it. If we succeed, we might even be able to use it to seek the Golden Core Great Dao."

After several consecutive inquiries, Xu Yunfan also heard clearly that there are many cultivation lines in this immortal path cultivation. Once a predecessor establishes a foundation using this method, although later generations can still establish a foundation, the one who benefits is the true master who established the foundation first.

It's like support; countless lower-level cultivators practicing this method become the pyramid's base, continuously supporting the person at the pyramid's peak.

Immortal path foundation establishment is actually like building a tower.

Youquan continued: "Great Lord, now true masters cannot descend upon the Divine Martial Realm. The ones who come down will be at most true transmission disciples at the Great Perfection of Qi Training. With your strength..."

Youquan's demonic energy suddenly stagnated; it realized it had let slip a fatal piece of information.

Xu Yunfan, however, saw this and sneered. What clumsy acting. This dog has been trying to bewitch him from beginning to end.

His Ten Extremes True Qi turned into chains that pierced into the Purple Gold Core, making Youquan howl in pain again.

"So that's it. What you fear isn't Foundation Establishment, but someone using the path of martial arts cultivation to refine that Martial Dao Profound Crystal, using it to support the Dao Base and achieve Divine Martial!"

Youquan's demonic energy on the Purple Gold Core shook violently, completely unexpected that Xu Yunfan would guess it from these clues.

Previously, Youquan used the Hundred Meridians Nether Art and Opening Meridian Pill as groundwork, precisely to make Xu Yunfan's cognition take the wrong lead first. Once the other party attempted to practice the Hundred Meridians Nether Art, it would naturally mix impurities into the other party's martial arts cultivation, thereby reducing the natural affinity for the Martial Dao Profound Crystal, and thus seek an opportunity.

Before the words fully fell, Xu Yunfan, having figured out the key point, executed Youquan without hesitation.
