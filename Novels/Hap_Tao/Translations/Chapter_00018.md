# Chapter 18: The Heavenly Demon

Xu Family Manor, Southern District, Central Hall.

The spacious hall was filled with a heavy atmosphere. Xu Yunbiao's corpse lay on the ground, already showing signs of decay in the short time since his death. The wounds at his temples and chest emitted a foul stench.

A Daoist priest in white robes covered his nose and mouth with a handkerchief as he bent slightly to examine Xu Yunbiao's injuries. This was the same priest Qin Ziling had seen earlier in the alchemy room of the small building.

"Has the Immortal Master discovered anything?" asked the tall man Qin Ziling had also seen in the alchemy room. His face was dark with anger, eyes blazing like a beast ready to devour its prey.

"Seventh Young Master Xu was poisoned with corpse venom—at least from a high-grade Bronze Corpse, possibly even a Silver Corpse. Given his training in skin and membrane cultivation, his robust physique and abundant qi and blood, ordinary corpse venom wouldn't have killed him so quickly after being pricked with poisoned needles at his temples and heart," the white-robed priest replied grimly.

"A high-grade Bronze Corpse or even a Silver Corpse? How is that possible?" The tall man and several others nearby paled at the words.

"High-grade Bronze Corpses and Silver Corpses are indeed rare. Even within the Corpse Demon Sect, only branch leaders and above possess such level of zombies. However, obtaining venom from them isn't overly difficult—at least for inner sect disciples of the Corpse Demon Sect," the priest explained.

"I've already questioned everyone. No one entered or left Yuanbiao's room before his scream. The southern district houses only our Xu Family clansmen and thoroughly vetted servants—no outsiders could have infiltrated. Moreover, our Xu Family has no enmity with the Corpse Demon Sect, and Yuanbiao was merely a concubine-born son with no significant standing in the family. Why would they target him?" the tall man frowned.

"In these chaotic times where warlords vie for power, does one truly need a grudge to kill?" The priest sneered coldly. "If the Xu Family can secretly ally with our Sacred Sect, why wouldn't those in the city collude with the Corpse Demon Sect? Do you truly believe they'd obediently follow imperial decrees and watch your family grow unchecked?"

"As for infiltration, that's for you to investigate. Even the tightest walls have cracks. But their motive for killing the seventh young master eludes me—perhaps a warning? If so, it's utterly foolish!" The priest shook his head.

"Foolish or not, if I confirm their alliance with the Corpse Demon Sect, they won't escape responsibility!" The Xu Family patriarch clenched his fists, his expression savage.

Under the cover of night, Qin Ziling's spirit drifted over the fields, unaware of the events unfolding in Xu Manor—the very events he had set in motion.

Soon, his spirit returned to the hillock where his physical body was hidden. Before fully merging back, a night breeze carried the stench of decay to his senses.

"Thankfully it's the dead of night. If anyone came here, my hiding spot would be exposed," Qin Ziling thought with a start.

As his spirit returned to his body, he felt the fatigue of prolonged separation—a sickly weakness disrupting his qi and blood flow.

"Before reaching the Soul Division realm, I can't let my spirit wander for too long. Not only does it leave my body vulnerable, but the weakness also slows my martial progress," Qin Ziling warned himself, sobered by the experience.

The Soul Division realm allowed splitting one's spirit—half remaining in the body while the other roamed freely. Before achieving this, spirit separation left the body an empty shell. If discovered and destroyed, the homeless spirit would weaken and eventually perish.

With these thoughts, Qin Ziling stored the Bronze Ape Corpse and wearily made his way back to Anhe Village under the moonlight.

Stealthily scaling the courtyard wall, he sighed in relief—only to freeze when he noticed the half-open door of the western wing. There stood Yin Ranyue, her beautiful eyes fixed intently on him.

"Cough... upset stomach," Qin Ziling explained awkwardly.

"Oh," Yin Ranyue responded, her moonlit gaze unusually penetrating.

"Why aren't you asleep?" he asked again, inexplicably uneasy under her scrutiny.

"Couldn't sleep." She approached quietly.

"Don't worry. Everything will be better after a good rest," he reassured softly.

"Mm." Nodding obediently, she turned back to her room.

Once inside, Yin Ranyue puzzled over Qin Ziling's strange behavior. "It was definitely Young Master who left earlier—that's why he didn't answer my knocking. And why climb the wall for a bathroom trip?" 

Though confused, strangely, recalling Qin Ziling's words eased her earlier despair, and she soon drifted into peaceful sleep.

Returning to his room, Qin Ziling sat cross-legged and began cultivating the "Eternal River of Stars Visualization Technique."

Perhaps due to the recent killing, hallucinations emerged during his practice. In the visions, he relived his past life—his body freezing solid, skin withering, muscles rotting with maggots, until only bones remained.

Unshaken, Qin Ziling maintained his focus. The technique's scriptures described this phenomenon as "Heavenly Demons"—illusions growing stronger alongside one's spiritual power.

Heavenly Demons represented the dark aspects of the mind—fear, anxiety, hatred, violence—that amplified with spiritual growth. If unable to overcome them during cultivation, one risked either spiritual annihilation or descent into madness.

"Vast as the stars, cyclical without end. The cosmos is eternal, the river of stars everlasting!"

Suddenly, Qin Ziling visualized the boundless starry river and the towering figure seated within it. An ancient, indomitable power surged through him, dispelling the decaying visions.

No sooner had the corpses vanished than he found himself surrounded by alluring, unclothed maidens. The intoxicating sensations nearly made him abandon himself to pleasure, but he clung to his core, steadfastly visualizing the eternal starry river.

Illusions rose and fell until, after an immeasurable time, a new vision appeared—a golden-armored warrior radiating divine majesty, sword at his waist.

"A Heavenly Soldier of the Divine Court!" Qin Ziling rejoiced. By conquering the Heavenly Demons born from his negative emotions, they had transformed into celestial guardians of his mind.

Though these soldiers couldn't manifest physically, they would aid in spiritual battles when summoned.
