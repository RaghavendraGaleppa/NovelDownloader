# Chapter 163: Inventory (Bonus Chapter for Reader 171021102948988)

Li Shiming rummaged through the storage bracelet of the Northern Shu Qi Refining cultivator, shifting his attention from the artifact section to the jade slip area nearby.

The Northern Shu cultivator had stored numerous jade slips, most of which were ordinary. Picking one up casually, Li Shiming probed it with his spiritual sense and discovered it was actually the cultivator's diary.

The diary recorded conflicts between this Qi Refining cultivator and a talented disciple within their sect, detailing his grievances against the latter. The tone was so venomous that even Li Shiming, as an outsider, could sense the cultivator's psychological abnormalities.

It truly lived up to the saying: "Who keeps a diary? Only those with something to hide!"

Li Shiming set aside all the diary jade slips. He had no time to read such things—too much exposure might even affect his own mental state.

Only two jade slips proved useful: one purple and one gold.

First, he examined the purple jade slip with his spiritual sense. It contained a technique called "Purple Qi from the East," which involved absorbing the first rays of purple qi from the morning sunlight. This initial purple qi was exceptionally beneficial for cultivators, enhancing their physical constitution, purifying spiritual energy, and strengthening mental fortitude.

Of course, the more comprehensive a technique, the weaker its effects. However, "Purple Qi from the East" was a supplementary technique. Even if it only provided a minuscule daily improvement, the cumulative effect over time would be significant, offering substantial benefits.

Li Shiming was quite satisfied. He had acquired another useful technique—one that provided gradual, long-term growth without being constrained by cultivation realms. Whether at the Foundation Establishment or Golden Core stage, "Purple Qi from the East" would remain effective.

Given that the jade slip was merely purple, he surmised that this technique wasn't particularly rare in Northern Shu.

Next, he examined the golden jade slip, which contained a spiritual sense technique called "Hundred Thoughts, Thousand Returns Art." Unlike the "Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Technique" he had previously obtained—which focused on strengthening spiritual sense into divine sense—this technique specialized in splitting spiritual sense into multiple strands.

If "Simultaneous Left and Right" was the mundane version of multitasking, then "Hundred Thoughts, Thousand Returns Art" was its cultivation counterpart. But it went beyond mere dual-tasking—it allowed spiritual sense to divide repeatedly, creating multiple independent strands of thought based on the practitioner's proficiency.

A sudden realization struck Li Shiming: wasn't this the perfect technique for controlling the nine flying sword artifacts?

---

The Northern Shu Qi Refining cultivator had likely planned to cultivate "Hundred Thoughts, Thousand Returns Art" after advancing to Foundation Establishment, splitting his spiritual sense to control all nine flying swords simultaneously. With nine artifacts, he could either form arrays or overwhelm enemies through sheer numbers, making him virtually invincible within his realm.

However, manipulating nine artifacts with this technique—even if they were a matched set that consumed less spiritual energy than mismatched ones—would still place an enormous strain on spiritual reserves. A Foundation Establishment cultivator's reserves would likely be exhausted quickly.

Yet Li Shiming's eyes gleamed with excitement. Wasn't this technique and the nine flying swords tailor-made for him? 

As an advanced formation master with spiritual sense surpassing his peers, and with his plans to cultivate the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique" at the Foundation Establishment stage—a method renowned for its vast spiritual energy reserves—he would soon be able to wield all nine swords. The metal-attribute artifact he had just acquired could be given to his doppelganger for better use.

The remaining items in the storage bracelet consisted of various materials, mostly alchemical ingredients with only a few low-quality formation materials. This suggested the original owner had a keen interest in alchemy. Noticing these, Li Shiming recalled the cauldron among the high-grade artifacts—it was actually an alchemical furnace.

For now, Li Shiming had no intention of learning alchemy. His daily cultivation schedule was already packed, and he still had extensive research projects to attend to. Still, he didn't plan to dispose of the materials. If he ever decided to study alchemy, he'd have ample resources to practice with.

Unbeknownst to him, the abundance of alchemical materials was due to the Mingxin Sect's evacuation. The original owner, a novice alchemist with influential connections, had been entrusted with a portion of the sect's Qi Refining-stage alchemical supplies. Had Li Shiming sold them, he would have realized their value rivaled that of all other treasures in the bracelet combined.

After finishing his inventory, Li Shiming casually fastened the storage bracelet to his wrist. Since he had openly seized it from an enemy in front of multiple Golden Core elders, its origins were clear, and he had no qualms about using it.

---

The Foundation Establishment senior piloting the flying boat glanced at the storage bracelet on Li Shiming's wrist, envy flashing in his eyes. Even he, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, only possessed a storage pouch—far inferior to a storage bracelet.

"Senior, my cave abode is just ahead!" Li Shiming said, noticing they were approaching Eagle Beak Island and eager to escape the senior's lingering gaze.

"Li Shiming, conceal that storage bracelet well. Don't let others see it," the senior transmitted silently as Li Shiming disembarked with his two senior brothers.

"Thank you for your concern, Senior," Li Shiming replied with a slight bow, momentarily surprised before smiling in understanding.

Back in his cave abode, Li Shiming accelerated his production schedule. With ample electricity, he and his doppelganger worked simultaneously.

At dawn the next day, before sunrise, he emerged from the underground cave and ascended the island's small peak. One advantage of solitude was the freedom to choose optimal cultivation spots without interference. Had he been in the Nine Peaks, his cave abode wouldn't have access to the first morning light—those prime locations were reserved for higher-ranking cultivators.

Seated atop the peak, surrounded by open sea, he reviewed the "Purple Qi from the East" technique in his mind. The horizon was still dark—the calm before dawn.

As time passed, a sliver of pale light appeared on the horizon, soon transforming into a crimson line. Suddenly, the sun leaped from the sea.

In that instant, Li Shiming sensed a wave of purple qi sweeping across the world. Despite his efforts to absorb it fully, he only captured a fraction. Yet even this tiny amount subtly enhanced his physique, spiritual energy, and mental strength.

For someone like him—whose physique had already reached the pinnacle of the Qi Refining stage through the "Diamond Body Protection Divine Art" and "Sword Demon Secret Canon," further augmented by the Raging Vajra Intent and his third-grade sword foundation—any further improvement was theoretically impossible. Yet the purple qi had achieved the impossible, offering a breakthrough beyond his limits.

The effect on his spiritual energy was less pronounced. While it didn't increase his reserves, it slightly condensed them. Given his rapid cultivation speed, his spiritual energy had always lacked density. Unfortunately, the purple qi's effect here was too weak compared to his own refinement efforts.

As for his mental strength, the purple qi provided an imperceptible boost—detectable only because he had already developed spiritual sense. This was particularly valuable, as mental growth was notoriously difficult. The "Ice Heart Jade Thought Art" had become more of a spiritual attack method after his spiritual sense formation, offering minimal mental enhancement. Since he couldn't yet practice "Hundred Thoughts, Thousand Returns Art" or "Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Technique," any means to strengthen his mind was precious.

The amount of purple qi absorbed each time was minuscule—only a trace captured at sunrise. The rest of the time was spent assimilating it internally. Convinced of its benefits, Li Shiming added "Purple Qi from the East" to his daily morning routine.

With a flick of his finger, he summoned the Jade Breaker Sword. After recent battles, he had gained deeper insight into the sword bone in his right thumb. When controlling the sword, he could sense a faint connection between the bone and the blade—a connection he could sever at will, depriving the sword of its unique energy.

Unbeknownst to him, this energy was a wisp of sword intent emanating from the sword bone. Combat experience had taught him its formidable power—easily severing spiritual imprints within artifacts. Previously, he hadn't prioritized honing this ability, but now he recognized its potential. Mastering greater control over this energy could significantly boost his combat prowess.

He didn't inquire about the aftermath of the Seven Stars Island incident, knowing it was beyond his station. Only Golden Core elders were privy to such details, and even if he knew, he couldn't influence the outcome. 

Personally, Li Shiming hoped the Northern Shu invasion would fail. After the recent skirmish, he had earned the enmity of a Northern Shu Golden Core cultivator. Should Northern Shu conquer the seven sects, he'd face relentless pursuit. For now, under the sect's protection, he could cultivate in peace.

Days passed. Yin Shilan was increasingly busy, leaving little time for their usual chats, while Ren Fei'er had gone into complete seclusion. There was no news of a Northern Shu invasion—if not for his participation in the battle, he might have doubted the conflict ever happened.

A sense of urgency gnawed at him, as if peaceful days were numbered. Whether due to this or a natural acceleration in his cultivation, his "Five Elements Absorption Art" progressed rapidly, bringing him close to the ninth level of Qi Refining. Had his spiritual energy not remained stable, he might have suspected an anomaly.

In truth, this surge was linked to the modifications made by the Northern Shu Golden Core swordsman, Yun Xingyi. When Yun fused the sword bone into Li Shiming's thumb, he had also used his Golden Core and natal sword to subtly alter Li Shiming's body. These changes, initially imperceptible, had gradually enhanced his sensitivity to and absorption of spiritual energy.

His cultivation speed recalculations became a near-weekly occurrence. Originally, his theoretical speed—factoring in his peak Qi Refining doppelganger's assistance and accounting for realm differences—should have been slightly higher than baseline. Yet his current speed approached 200, nearly double that of a Heavenly Spiritual Root.

This acceleration was the result of a Golden Core swordsman sacrificing his natal sword and Golden Core—a transformation unrelated to spiritual roots that would gradually diminish as Li Shiming advanced. Without the doppelganger's help, his speed now matched that of a Heavenly Spiritual Root.

Four months later, an unexpected visitor arrived.

Responding to the transmission outside his mountain-protecting formation, Li Shiming promptly opened it. The formation around Eagle Beak Island had long since been upgraded from its original small-scale version. Leveraging the island's terrain and oceanic surroundings, he had transformed it into a multi-layered defensive array connected to the seabed, boosting its protective power severalfold at a cost of over ten thousand spirit stones in materials.

Security was one area where Li Shiming spared no expense. The formation now featured three layers of spiritual barriers—the maximum achievable given the island's constraints. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators would struggle to breach it, let alone early or mid-stage ones.

"Uncle Yin, please come in!" Li Shiming bowed respectfully to the visitor.

It was Elder Yin. Li Shiming hadn't expected him to visit Eagle Beak Island personally—usually, he would have been summoned for any matters requiring discussion.
