# Chapter 12: Old Man Xu's Cultivation Family

After observing the stone tablet for a while, Lu Xu cast all other thoughts from his mind.

“I won’t think about anything else for now. This cultivation breakthrough calls for a celebration!”

He rose and walked into the kitchen, started a fire, lifted the pot lid, and placed two large bowls of Green Lake Spirit Rice inside, adding water to steam them. Then he boiled another pot of water, cut a fist-sized piece of demonic beast meat, threw it into the boiling water, and added some spices.

Once the spirit rice was steamed, Lu Xu took out two eggs he had bought from He Qing and stir-fried them with a delicious spirit herb to make a dish. When the demonic beast meat was cooked, he sliced it and arranged it on a plate. He took out a small dish, poured in some aged vinegar, added a little soy sauce and salt. Finally, he retrieved a pot of Purple Gourd Spirit Wine and placed it on the table.

Meat, wine, and a side dish! A simple yet delicious feast was ready!

After wolfing down his meal, Lu Xu felt a warmth spread through his body, his vital energy surging to the brim, an impulse to let it burst forth. He quickly went to the courtyard, assumed a stance, and began practicing a set of fist techniques. This was a set of martial arts he had learned when he roamed the mortal world, called the Pine Crane Longevity Fist. This set of fist techniques was particularly effective in strengthening the body, prolonging life, and enhancing qi and blood.

Practicing the fist techniques again and again, Lu Xu felt as if the restless power within him had found an outlet. Only after his boiling vital energy subsided did Lu Xu stop.

“My strength has increased significantly. This demonic beast meat truly has a miraculous effect on the physical body. Foundation Establishment requires passing three trials, and one of them is the physical body trial. Although I’m still far from Foundation Establishment, there’s no harm in tempering my body in advance!”

After quietly sensing the changes in his body for a while in the courtyard, Lu Xu returned to his room.

Later that night, Lu Xu opened the window on the second floor and gazed at the bright moon outside. “It’s already been four years since I embarked on the path of cultivation!” he thought with deep emotion.

In these four years, it felt as if he had lived through the entire lives of many Qi Condensation cultivators. Qi Condensation Layer Three – this was basically the lifelong cultivation limit for bottom-tier cultivators like He Qing and Old Man Xu. More than half of the cultivators in the market city were stuck at this realm. Although these first three layers of Qi Condensation were said to be the easiest to cultivate, the time it took to cultivate from a mortal to Qi Condensation Layer Three was by no means short. Even the Mo family disciples with mid-grade spiritual roots needed five to six years. And that was with the aid of abundant resources.

In the past year, Lu Xu had consumed four bottles of Qi Replenishing Pills, spending two hundred and forty spirit stones – a huge expenditure. Yet, the prodigies of the Mo family consumed no fewer pills than he did. However, his speed in reaching Qi Condensation Layer Three was still at least a year faster than theirs. The fundamental reason for this difference was the experience from the ‘Azure Wood Manual’ that Lu Xu had replicated!

“Four years of effort have brought me to the same level as Old Man Xu and He Qing, who have diligently cultivated for decades. Indeed, without a cheat or a system, it’s impossible to survive in the cultivation world!”

“But the more this is true, the more cautious I must be!”

He closed the window, and the room once again fell into darkness. The night passed quietly.

“Hahahahaha!”

The next day, a burst of laughter suddenly erupted from the courtyard.

“Old Man Xu?” Lu Xu’s eyes flashed with doubt. This old man was usually as quiet as a dead person; why was he suddenly so emotional?

“Old Xu, what good news have you stumbled upon?” He Qing’s voice came from next door. Lu Xu also walked out of his room to look outside.

“Haha, my grandson has finally had his spiritual root detected! A lower mid-grade earth-attribute spiritual root, better than mine! Hahahaha, our Xu family finally has hope!”

Old Man Xu stood in the courtyard, his face flushed with joy, his delight impossible to conceal. He paced back and forth excitedly; he probably wouldn’t have been this happy even if his own cultivation had broken through. Standing beside him was an equally excited middle-aged man who bore some resemblance to Old Man Xu. In addition, there was a child, seemingly seven or eight years old, looking somewhat bewildered and frightened at the people in the courtyard.

“Congratulations, congratulations! Old Xu, your long-cherished wish has finally come true!” He Qing’s face showed envy as he cupped his hands and congratulated Old Man Xu. He knew about Old Man Xu’s family situation. When the old man was forty, he had given up hope of further cultivation breakthroughs and placed his future on establishing a cultivation family. Unfortunately, cultivators often had difficulty having offspring, and Old Man Xu had only ever had one child in his lifetime. So, he had no choice but to place his hope on the next generation.

He sent his wife and child to the mortal world, where, under the care of cultivators, they lived comfortably. After Old Man Xu’s son came of age, under his father’s arrangement, he married twenty-seven concubines and had now fathered forty to fifty children. Previously, forty-two children had been brought here, and after Old Man Xu’s examination, none of their spiritual roots met the minimum standard for cultivation. Initially, Old Man Xu had given up hope. But when the forty-third child was brought over, a suitable spiritual root was indeed found in him.

This made Old Man Xu overjoyed. His long-cherished wish of establishing a cultivation family now had a real possibility of success, even if it was just the first step.

“Congratulations, Old Xu! With your help, this child might even be able to reach Foundation Establishment in the future!” Lu Xu also cupped his hands and offered his congratulations to Old Man Xu.

Old Man Xu’s face was full of smiles: “Hahahaha, Foundation Establishment is beyond imagination. As long as this child can cultivate to the late Qi Condensation stage, I will be satisfied, truly satisfied!”

He Qing looked on with deep envy, then suddenly sighed. “Seeing your grandson, Old Xu, I suddenly realize I should also consider my lifelong matter!”

Old Man Xu paused, wondering why that sounded like an insult.

“But ultimately, I don’t have your assets. Even if my child had a spiritual root, it would be difficult to nurture them,” He Qing said with a gloomy expression.

“Fellow Daoist He, there’s no need to be disheartened. If you were to have a child with a mid to high-grade spiritual root, then even without many spirit stones, it would be enough to nurture them!” Old Man Xu said, his face still beaming.

He Qing gave a bitter smile, shook his head, and looked at Old Man Xu’s grandson with complex emotions. He knew that Old Man Xu’s grandson’s cultivation path was destined to be much smoother than any of theirs. One must understand that Old Man Xu had accumulated hundreds of spirit stones over the years. If all of that was invested in his grandson, the latter’s early cultivation would undoubtedly be very fast.

Generally, a person’s spiritual root can only be detected after the age of eight, meaning the minimum age for cultivation is eight. Old Man Xu’s grandson was currently eight years old. With his aptitude and Old Man Xu’s support, he would likely break through the bottleneck of early Qi Condensation and enter Qi Condensation Layer Four within twenty-five years. His future was boundless!

“Come, Yuanxiang, bow to these two seniors!” Old Man Xu patted his grandson’s head, smiling, trying to appear benevolent. His grandson’s name was Xu Yuanxiang. Although the child looked a bit scared, he was quite sensible and bowed to both Lu Xu and He Qing.

Lu Xu and He Qing exchanged a glance, both shaking their heads with a helpless smile. He Qing’s mouth twitched, and he said, “Old Xu, I still have two eggs from my Black Feathered Chickens at home. They can strengthen the foundation and cultivate vital essence. Take them for your child to supplement his body!”

“I don’t have much, so I can only offer two catties of spirit rice. I’ll bring it over later!”

“Haha, fellow Daoists, you’re too kind, too kind! I, this old man, shall thank both of you on behalf of my grandson. Little Lu, if you ever have any questions about talismans in the future, feel free to come and ask me!”

Old Man Xu enthusiastically promised Lu Xu, who, of course, put on a very grateful expression. The old man still didn’t know that Lu Xu’s talisman crafting skills had already surpassed his by an immeasurable margin.

A while later, Old Man Xu’s son left, continuing to work towards his father’s grand undertaking of establishing a cultivation family! The eight-year-old child remained and would be personally nurtured by Old Man Xu. For this, Old Man Xu would have to pay an additional two spirit stones annually in rent to the Mo family. Yes, the rent in this market city was collected per person. The market city didn’t mind cultivators bringing mortals in, as long as they paid enough spirit stones.
