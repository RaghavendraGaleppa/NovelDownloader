Chapter 125: The Ice Cube is in Danger? The Trial: To Succeed, One Man Must Rise Upon Ten Thousand Bones!

Stepping through the glowing portal, Li Mo’s vision cleared, and a panel appeared before his eyes.

**[Name: Ying Bing]**
**[Age: 16]**
**[Constitution: Taiyin Moon Phoenix Body.]**
**[Realm: Inner Qi Jade Liquid Stage.]**
**[Destiny: Red (Carries the Emperor Bone, Fate of Black Ice, Spirit of Autumn Water, has the appearance of a Phoenix Sovereign)]**
**[Evaluation: Fate is fraught with calamity, yet she always turns misfortune into blessing. Though her wings are not yet fully grown, when the winds and clouds shift, she will surely hang high in the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, a Phoenix ruling the Six Domains and Eight Wastes.]**
**[Recent Encounter: Failed to争夺 (seize) the Blood Phoenix Essence. Will suffer serious injuries upon entering the third layer of the秘境 (Secret Realm).]**

“!!?”

Standing at the entrance of the Secret Realm, Li Mo’s pupils constricted.

*Is the system malfunctioning?*

*The highest level in this Secret Realm is only the View Deity Realm.*

*She would fail? And even suffer serious injuries?*

“Bing...”

Before he could finish uttering a single word.

The blood-red light at the entrance of the Secret Realm suddenly surged, sweeping everyone at the entrance inside.

......

The blood-red light, resembling countless bubbles, carried everyone through an endless darkness, depositing them in different locations.

When Li Mo opened his eyes again, he seemed to be standing in an ancient battlefield.

This world was vast and boundless. The sky was dim, as if it had been weeping. The wind howled, threatening to snap bones, and the cries of lonely ghosts and wild spirits made one’s blood run cold.

It seemed that an extremely brutal battle had taken place here.

Before the battle, this place had likely been a forest, but now only countless black, withered branches remained, silently reaching out like claws toward the sky.

“The Blood Phoenix Secret Realm is no benevolent place.”

Li Mo felt the Karma Fire in his Dantian stirring.

The Karma Fire only reacted so strongly to places of great misfortune or to those of extreme evil.

Under normal circumstances.

As long as he didn't pull out his hammer, Ying Bing should have no rivals within this Secret Realm.

That is to say, she must have encountered some other variable.

And this variable is most likely related to the Secret Realm itself?

*Crack—*

Li Mo stepped down thoughtfully, crushing a beast bone underfoot with a crisp snap.

“The spiritual energy here is much more abundant than outside?”

“Is it because of that... Blood Phoenix Essence?”

Just as he was thinking this.

Suddenly, the sky trembled, and the originally dim stars emitted a brilliant light.

On the vast canopy of the sky, massive characters appeared, written with the strength of iron and the flair of silver hooks, visible to everyone.

**[Heaven and Earth are ruthless, treating all things as straw dogs.]**
**[To achieve the Dao of Martial Arts, one man’s success is built upon ten thousand bones!]**
**[Trial of the First Layer: Kill.]**
**[The top fifty have the qualification to enter the next layer.]**

The text on the sky wasn't long, but every word carried a chilling killing intent.

The meaning was concise and clear.

Hunt beasts, collect Beast Tokens.

Only the top fifty have the qualification to continue exploring the next layer.

Everyone looking at the text felt a tightening in their chests.

Although it says to hunt beasts, there is a quota limit.

What about those outside the top fifty?

Killing a beast yields only one Beast Token, but killing a person might yield much more...

These rules undoubtedly turned this place into a dark forest, where one must not only hunt beasts but also guard against the hearts of men.

When entering the Secret Realm, everyone was separated, preventing them from forming groups.

*Splash—*

The sky changed again.

Names appeared on it, but only the top fifty.

Obviously, the names left on the list in the end would gain the qualification to enter the next layer.

“Once you’re on this list, you become the target of everyone else.”

“Better get to work.”

Li Mo took a small notebook out of his怀里 (bosom).

He wasn't in a rush to hunt Beast Tokens. The opportunities within the Secret Realm were of little consequence to him; as long as he could enter the next layer in the end, that was enough.

The investment feedback was the top priority.

---

That was what Li Mo thought.

However, contrary to his wishes, he hadn't walked far when.

The bones on the ground suddenly moved without wind, piecing together into a complete skeleton of a beast, looking like a bear-like creature.

Hollow eye sockets glowed with a blood-red light, looking at Li Mo with a longing for living creatures and flesh.

“The aura is roughly at the Xuan Dan (Marrow Cleansing) Realm.”

“And without flesh, it's harder to deal with than a typical Xuan Dan cultivator. If there were many of them, they could even threaten the View Deity Realm.”

Li Mo was calculating the strength of the White Bone Bear.

*Rumble—*

The ground trembled as the beast lunged at him.

It moved like a gale, crushing the bluestones in its path to dust.

It struck down with a palm, carrying the sound of wind and thunder, its momentum terrifying.

However, when it slammed down onto the ground, it didn't hit anything.

The small figure in its vision had vanished不知何时 (who knows when).

“Hmph.”

“A mere Xuan Dan Realm, take my sword!”

The Chixiao sword left its sheath with a sharp hum. The sword light resembled a twisting dragon, sweeping with a fiery hue, illuminating dozens of meters of darkness.

*Have you ever seen a sword technique that descends from the heavens?*

Li Mo's swordsmanship was no weakling now.

Although he didn't have a monstrous talent for the sword, our little Li Mo, having spun around between the Ice Cube and Little Princess Jiang, had been heavily influenced.

It was like刷題 (刷题 - grinding problems) every day.

In his past life, he was a small town做題家 (做题家 - exam grinder).

He could be called the strongest small town swordsman!

*Swoosh—*

The superior sword technique, driven by Karma Fire, exerted power beyond its usual level.

*Crackle and pop—*

Dozens of sword lights crisscrossed.

The White Bone Bear's figure stiffened suddenly, then exploded into a brilliant firework.

Li Mo landed holding the Chixiao sword, his face expressionless, not even looking back at the explosion.

He just silently thought to himself:

*“Damn, that’s cool!”*

It felt... even better than going on a kill streak with a flashy hero like Yasuo or Li Bai.

“I really am such a show-off little boy.”

After吐槽 (complaining) about himself, Li Mo held his sword in his right hand and touched the hammer under his clothes with his left, walking into the darkness.

.......

At the same time.

In front of a deep, dark cave.

A young girl stood surrounded by a multicolored aura, her black hair dancing lightly. The moisture in the air condensed into crystal flakes, slowly drifting down.

The aura, driven by her inner energy, flowed slowly in all directions.

“The Blood Phoenix Essence is indeed not in the first layer of the Secret Realm.”

“I must go to the next layer.”

Ying Bing opened her eyes. Her clear, deep gaze seemed to pierce through the void.

She raised the Tianfrost Sword, its jade-like edge pointing towards the darkness inside the cave.

The darkness inside the cave seemed to swallow even light, from which came阵阵 (chilling) hissing sounds.

*Rustle rustle rustle—*

Countless giant white bone bats, numbering in the dozens, emerged. The weaker ones emitted the aura of the Inner Qi Jade Liquid Stage, while the strongest one, with a faint dark glow, was close to the View Deity Realm.

These bone bats, when alive, were known as:

Night Ghosts.

For a moment, the area in front of the cave was filled with ghostly shadows.

But the next moment.

A dazzling multicolored light washed over them.

.......

Meanwhile.

The rankings on the sky had also changed.

A name rapidly climbed to the top.

**Number One: Ying Bing, Beast Tokens Collected: 27.**

Exclamations of shock and doubt echoed throughout the Secret Realm.

“Already twenty-seven beasts killed in such a short time?”

“That speed... did she get lucky and pick them up off the road?”

“Notice, she didn't climb the ranks one by one; she shot straight to the top.”

“That means she slaughtered that many bone beasts in an instant?!”
