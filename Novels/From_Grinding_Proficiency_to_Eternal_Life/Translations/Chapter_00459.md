# Chapter 459: A Fight to the Death

He felt a slight stirring in his heart.

"If you are willing to betray the Bodhi Pure Land..."

Xu Yunfan lightly flicked his sword tip. With a thought, he used the command plaque of the Garrison Envoy to manipulate the Xuanming Seven Killings Array.借此, he drew in the Yin energy of the River of Netherworld, which automatically condensed into a black lotus platform beneath his feet.

He further used the method of the turtle and snake coiling to switch Yin and Yang, guiding extreme Yin to become ultimate Yin, constantly surging his own magical power, creating an endless momentum.

"The Primordial Origin Sect has thirty-six Cavern Heavens that can wash away the Buddhist imprint. With your cultivation of the True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra, entering the Divine Martial World to seize the innate golden nature would be as easy as flipping a hand."

Speaking of this, a smile appeared on Xu Yunfan's face. "With the status of a great world like the Divine Martial World, it might even be able to孕育 two Golden Core Dao Fruits."

The muscles on the Face of the Fierce Dragon Arhat twitched.

How could he not know this was the best choice?

He should have been a disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect three lifetimes ago.

But back then, for the sake of a quick achievement, he borrowed the "Reincarnation Pool" of the Bodhi Pure Land to refine his soul. Now, deep in his Sea of Consciousness, the Buddhist "wan" character seal is already branded.

Even if he were to defect now, as long as his soul is not destroyed, he would still be guided back to the Pure Land after reincarnation.

He has had several lifetimes of karma with them.
It is根本 impossible to break away from the Bodhi Pure Land.

Although he cultivates the True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra, what he has trained is the Pure Land's佛法. He is an Arhat under the command of the Wondrous Truth Bodhisattva.

In the instant of his hesitation, Xu Yunfan's sword had already been swung.

There was no dazzling sword light, only a seemingly slow but actually fast, dark, thin line划过 the night sky.

Where the sword edge passed, the long sky left behind the Northern Pole Subduing Demons Sword Qi that久久 did not dissipate, as if the sky had been割开 a wound.

Most诡异的是, the River of Netherworld随之掀起巨浪. Countless pale hands actually formed a giant, sky-covering palm,配合 the sword momentum to slap down at the Arhat.

The sword array merged. Only after the初步 understanding of the Array Dao had been perfected did Xu Yunfan dare to use the array like this. If it were any other Array Dao cultivator, they would likely suffer a backlash if they were not careful.

"Xuanwu Devours the Sky!"

The Fierce Dragon Arhat roared, holding his Demon-Subduing Pestle across his chest.

The pestle's body instantly manifested the shadows of a turtle and a snake, but they were incomplete. Without the True Martial Sword配合, this move's power was no more than thirty percent.

The instant the pitch-black sword light collided with the Buddhist pestle, the seven Sarira embedded in the pestle's head exploded simultaneously. In the burst of golden light, the phantom of an Arhat's golden body could be seen哀嚎ing as it shattered.

Xu Yunfan's sword momentum did not stop. The second sword followed immediately.

This time, the sword edge引动 the Big Dipper's stellar power. Seven starlights, like chains,缠绕 the sword body.

The Fierce Dragon Arhat gritted his teeth and spat out his origin essence blood. In the blood mist, a miniature lotus platform appeared—it was the projection of the "Twelve-Petal Golden Lotus" beneath the Wondrous Truth Bodhisattva.

The collision between the sword and the lotus created a terrifying乱流 of spiritual power. The surface of the River of Netherworld within a hundred-zhang radius instantly sank three zhang, revealing the bottom piled high with森森 white bones.

Xu Yunfan let out a 'tsk' sound, with an expression that seemed to say, 'I thought you were something special.'

"Your True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra is merely superficial."

The Fierce Dragon Arhat's face turned ashen as iron. Blue veins bulged on his bronze-colored skin, his Arhat相 completely gone.

He could clearly feel that the True Martial power flowing within Xu Yunfan's body was extremely pure. Every strand of it暗合 the Big Dipper's stellar power, far purer than the mixed Buddhist and Daoist qi he had painstakingly cultivated for thirty years.

What惊heartened him even more was the True Martial Sword in the other's hand. Every sword move precisely契合 the essence of the sutra.

The coiling of the turtle and snake contained the changes of the Celestial Stems, and the seven styles of the Big Dipper隐现 the mysteries of the Terrestrial Branches.
This was clearly the state of having comprehended the "True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra" to the point of "grasping its spirit and essence."

It was as if he was天生 suitable for cultivating the True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra, a true reincarnation of the True Martial Deity!

"The third sword, to send you to your next life!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly took a profound step, his form merging with the True Martial Sword.

Where the man and sword passed, the complete Xuanwu constellation appeared in the air, the turtle's head and snake's tail forming a Yin-Yang Taiji.

The Fierce Dragon Arhat's pupils contracted sharply,惊觉 that this sword was actually引动 the周天 stars.

He saw seven Big Dipper starlights like heavenly pillars falling from above,交织 with the sword qi to form an impenetrable dark net.

More terrifyingly, the River of Netherworld beneath his feet suddenly froze. Thousands of pale hands formed chains,缠住 his feet.

Between heaven and earth, there was not a single inch of space to maneuver!

In this critical moment, the Arhat suddenly broke the Buddhist beads around his neck.

The one hundred and eight Bodhi seeds scattered in all directions, each transforming into a miniature Arhat forming hand seals. These avatars simultaneously chanted the "Reincarnation Sutra," and the产生的共鸣 temporarily broke the restraint.

The Fierce Dragon Arhat took the opportunity to crush the jade talisman in his chest. A golden light descended from the ninth heaven, enveloping his entire body.

"Trying to use the Buddhist guiding golden light?"

Xu Yunfan sneered and changed his move. The True Martial Sword suddenly flew from his hand.

The sword body divided into seven in mid-air,钉住 the seven positions from Tian Shu to Yao Guang.

The guiding golden light instantly distorted, being violently ground to pieces by the True Martial Sword qi.

As the残余 golden light裹着 the Fierce Dragon Arhat shot towards the sky, the seventh sword light had already pierced through his chest,带出 a string of golden-red Arhat blood.

A sound like metal and iron clashing came from below as the Fierce Dragon Arhat重重砸 into the pile of bones on the bank of the River of Netherworld,溅起 a zhang-high spray of pale bone fragments.

The body, which should have been shattered, twisted诡异ly as it stood up. The bowl-sized贯穿 wound on its chest愈合 at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The Arhat let out a roar that did not sound human. The dragon patterns on his neck脱离 his skin, transforming into a three-zhang blood dragon in mid-air.

This beast opened its mouth and swallowed its master's残躯. Then,裹着 a sky-full of blood mist, it shot towards the heavens,拖出 a dazzling golden rainbow in the morning light, disappearing at the end of the horizon in an instant.

Xu Yunfan did not pursue. He simply looked thoughtfully towards the eastern sky, which was turning white.

This Fierce Dragon Arhat absolutely could not be so weak. Although he appeared severely injured, he had not actually伤及 his origin.

This scene was too deliberate.

Xu Yunfan shook his head slightly.

Having been in the Primordial Origin Sect for a long time, he could see the essence of many things at a glance.

If his guess was correct, the other party must have called for three or five helpers, just waiting for him to go out so they could swarm him.

The thin mist on the River of Netherworld gradually散去, and those pale hands sank back to the river bottom.

As Xu Yunfan turned, his fingertips quietly formed a seal, and a wisp of his spiritual consciousness追索 along the lingering aura of the True Martial Sword.

Since the other party had delivered himself to his door, this game concerning the source power of the Divine Martial World had only just begun.

On the path of the Dao, Xu Yunfan would naturally not yield in the slightest.

Only by killing the other party could his heart be at ease.

The golden rainbow transformed by the Fierce Dragon Arhat掠过 a hundred li of the River of Netherworld, suddenly坠落 before a desolate cliff.

Two figures who had long been waiting there immediately迎上.

"Senior Brother Fierce Dragon!"

A wrathful Arhat in a crimson kasaya, his voice like a great bell, said, "Has that villain from the Primordial Origin Sect pursued you?"

An old monk with white eyebrows垂肩 gently stroked the jade vase in his arms. The characters "Compassionate Navigation" on the vase emitted a soft luster.

"This old monk and my Wrathful-Eye Junior Brother have long laid down the Vajra Demon-Subduing Circle, just waiting for that Xu Yunfan to fall into our trap."

The wound on the Fierce Dragon Arhat's chest was still leaking golden blood. Hearing this, he felt a bit of regret and sighed. "There is no need to wait any longer, Junior Brothers Compassionate Navigation and Wrathful-Eye. That Xu Yunfan is as cunning as a fox. He has not taken a single step out of the Cold Crow Pass."

"What?"
