# Chapter 153: The Alternation of Sun and Moon, Opening the Aperture!

Ink traces flowed and spread with supreme divine charm.

The painting of Empress Huang Tian ascending to immortality and transforming into the Dao was extremely complex.

The first thing to appear was a bright moon, covering the sky. Coincidentally, just as this scene was outlined, the sky outside the window went dark.

A solar eclipse had occurred.

The moon, which had already fallen from the sky, seemed unwilling to set, and its brilliance suddenly flared brightly.

Changing the heavens and swapping the moon!

Li Mo: "!"

He also saw the scene outside the window, his gaze involuntarily stunned.

Was all this celestial anomaly caused by the unfinished painting before him?

With every additional stroke of ink on the painting, the wondrous spectacle in the heavens deepened slightly.

And within the scroll.

A peerlessly elegant figure appeared before the bright moon.

With her appearance, profound mysteries permeated the air, and the entire world resonated.

She seemed to be the ruler of the nine heavens and ten earths, the sole existence in the universe. Before her, all things paled in comparison.

She was the only one.

Li Mo focused his gaze but found that the "ice lump" on the painting was just as she had been yesterday.

Time seemed to have lost its meaning to her.

Who first saw the moon by the river?

When did the moon first shine upon people?

She seemed to be looking at him through the painting...

Her eyes were incredibly complex, as if holding a thousand words, but in the end, they all turned into a soft sigh.

Her vermilion lips parted slightly.

No sound could be heard.

Because at that moment, the sky outside the window suddenly became turbulent again.

Rumble—

Three divine rays pierced the darkness, and the scorching sunlight churned the sky, as if bringing about the end of the world.

It was the three great suns.

In the unseen realm.

It seemed that even the heavens had fallen into a rage at this moment.

...

On the main peak of Qingyuan, in the ancestral hall.

Ying Bing, who was sitting before the fragments of the Bronze Divine Tree and visualizing the forms of a hundred birds, suddenly pursed her lips.

A powerful throb arose in her heart.

Having stepped onto the Path of Visualizing the Divine, she already possessed a strong sixth sense.

It felt as if...

Something very important was happening.

Hum—

Just then.

The fragments of the Bronze Divine Tree pulsed with a mysterious light, enveloping the entire ancestral hall.

The countless forms of a hundred birds, imprinted by the will of Great Shang's experts, all returned to the divine tree with extreme vigilance.

"What is happening outside?"

Shangguan Wencang asked with a frown.

Qian Bufan, who had just returned from outside, had a grave expression.

"Outside, for some unknown reason, a solar eclipse has suddenly occurred. The three great suns are all covered by the realm of the Great Yin."

"A solar eclipse..."

Shangguan Wencang took a heavy puff from his dry pipe.

He didn't know what this meant either, so he could only look inquiringly towards a distance.

The old man guarding the entrance of the ancestral hall, who was dozing off, muttered to himself:

"It's been thousands of years since a solar eclipse. How strange..."

"For the Bronze Divine Tree to react like this, it must be an extraordinary event."

"Today, little Bing'er probably won't be able to practice."

"Her dual Golden Cores aren't perfect yet; it's a bit too early anyway."

"We're just hoping she'll enter the Visualization stage sooner to bring us some face at the Cloud Piercing Sword City," the elders discussed amongst themselves.

At that moment.

A disciple from Ruyi Peak suddenly ran out.

He looked frantic and said repeatedly:

"The traitor Yin Huaxuan actually shed his shell and escaped趁著 the celestial anomaly!"

"Huh?"

The elders shot to their feet, their faces filled with shock.

Allowing an inner realm traitor to escape would bring endless harm. This matter was of great importance.

The celestial anomaly, in the final analysis, had nothing to do with them. If the sky were to fall, the tall ones would hold it up.

---

But if Yin Huaxuan were to escape...

"He's severely injured and hasn't healed. He can't have gone far," Shangguan Wencang said, tapping his pipe heavily.

"Have all disciples above the Visualization stage form groups and search for him. Dig three feet into the ground if you must, but bring him back!"

...

Yantian Sect.

On the high, sky-reaching Observational Platform.

"Chaos, utter chaos..."

The old woman who had been sitting here like a stone statue, muttered to herself.

She took out the mysterious jade plate again, sliding the jade pieces on it, and began her divination.

The trajectories of the jade pieces became increasingly profound, and their speed grew faster and faster.

In the end, it was as if a single glance would make one feel nauseous from the discomfort.

Even the old woman couldn't bear it.

As if she had seen something, her mind suddenly shook violently.

A mouthful of pale golden blood slid from the corner of her mouth, silently dripping onto the jade plate.

"Master!"

The少女 with a Daoist topknot, who had been afraid to disturb her, only dared to come forward and support the old woman now that she saw her face was as yellow as paper. She quickly took out a small bottle containing a translucent, jade-like liquid.

It was actually a full bottle of Emperor's Essence.

"Master, what did you just see?"

The old woman shook her head and simply said:

"It has to do with the Hidden Dragon List."

"You... go to Yunzhou once."

...

In the Autumn Water Pavilion.

Li Mo's mind was in a混沌 for a moment, his thoughts falling into a blank.

It was a long while before he came to his senses, remembering what had just happened.

He had evolved the painting of the "ice lump" into the scene of Empress Huang Tian ascending to immortality, turning it into a Divine Form of the Great Dao, and then the heavens had undergone an anomaly.

"This... is definitely related to that painting," Li Mo thought, wanting to go look for it again.

But he found that the Divine Form painting on the table had already vanished.

What's going on?

Where did my painting go?

At that moment, he discovered that his Little World seemed to have become a bit strange.

The sun was gone.

Hanging high in the sky was actually a bright moon!

Now, both the moon and the sun existed.

This meant that in his Little World, there was now a cycle of sunset and moonrise, and the passage of time!

This also represented that from this point on, he possessed both the Sun and the Moon, two Golden Cores!

He had inexplicably gained another Golden Core.

"If I'm not mistaken..."

"This bright moon is the moon from that painting?"

Li Mo was momentarily stunned.

Had that Divine Form painting been imprinted into his Little World?

As if sensing his thoughts.

The painting slowly unfurled.

However, it seemed different from what he had seen before.

Ying Bing was nowhere to be seen.

But Li Mo could somehow feel...

She was there.

The profound and supreme meaning that transcended time struck again...

He could use the Divine Form painting within his Little World to observe this Great Dao Divine Form!

Li Mo felt as if he had become a speck of dust in the River of Time, a lonely boat drifting along the current.

In a daze.

He saw many figures on the banks of the River of Time looking at him.

Humans, beasts, some ordinary, some as deep as an abyss, some incredibly clear, and countless in number.

It was all of creation.

At that moment, he suddenly understood in his heart what the benefits of a Divine Body were.

As long as it was an existence that did not belong to the outer world.

He could bear it all!

As this realization arose.

One of the apertures in his spiritual soul, amidst endless refinement, shed its dust and began to develop towards a crystalline, jade-like state.

He had opened an aperture.
