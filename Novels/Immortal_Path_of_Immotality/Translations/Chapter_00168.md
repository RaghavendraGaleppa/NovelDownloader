# Chapter 167: The Mantis Stalks the Cicada

The atmosphere in the hall grew tense, thick with the oppressive feeling of an impending storm. 

The elders of the Gongsun clan exchanged fierce glances, each silently contemplating whether to silence the outsider permanently. 

The Spirit Vein Tide was a once-in-a-millennium opportunity—even top-tier sects couldn't encounter it at will. Though only five spots were available (as too many participants would disrupt the convergence of earth vein energies and reduce the yield of Heavenly Dew), this limitation only made it more precious. 

The Heavenly Dew was a celestial blessing that emerged when a Golden Core cultivator shattered their core to form an infant during the Thunder Tribulation. It could enhance a cultivator's spiritual roots and comprehension—a treasure so rare that few Nascent Soul cultivators were willing to preserve and trade it instead of using it themselves. The fact that the Spirit Vein Tide could produce such a resource made it the envy of the entire cultivation world!

This opportunity could gift the Gongsun clan five exceptionally talented youths. While their potential to reach Nascent Soul remained uncertain, forming Golden Cores was highly probable—a pivotal moment for the clan's future rise. 

The elders' intense reaction was understandable. 

The problem was, while they would have silenced an ordinary intruder without hesitation, Lin Shan was no ordinary man. As an envoy of a major demonic sect dispatched by their high command, his disappearance would undoubtedly provoke retaliation. Not only would it delay the summons from the Disciplinary Dharma King, but losing the Black Lotus Sect's envoy would bring catastrophic consequences for the Gongsun clan. 

Moreover, they couldn't be certain whether Lin Shan was the only one who knew about their Spirit Vein Tide. If he spread the news, wouldn't that also spell disaster? 

The elders exchanged glances, realizing the dilemma: they couldn't kill him, nor could they drive him away. 

It seemed their only option was to sacrifice a little to preserve the greater good. 

After a flurry of silent communication, they quickly reached a consensus. 

First, they needed to placate him and ensure his silence. 

Second Elder Gongsun Lü, representing the clan, finally responded: 

"Very well. The Gongsun clan agrees to grant you one spot in the Spirit Vein Tide, Daoist Lin. However, you must swear a Dao Heart Oath not to reveal this to anyone."

Lin Shan inwardly admired the decisiveness of these old foxes. Without hesitation, he complied, knowing they wouldn't trust him otherwise.

Next, Lin Shan rubbed his hands sheepishly and smiled at Gongsun Lü. 

The Second Elder sighed inwardly, cursing the greed of demonic cultivators, and summoned a clansman. After exchanging whispers and handing over a token, the clansman soon returned with a bulging storage pouch. 

Lin Shan accepted it discreetly, probing it with his spiritual sense—as did the Black Bone Demon Lord hanging at his waist. 

Inside lay 1,500 mid-grade spirit stones, neatly arranged and gleaming brilliantly. 

In the cultivation world, exchange rates between mid-grade and low-grade spirit stones weren't fixed. Like fiat currencies, they fluctuated based on the manipulation of top sects controlling the spirit stone mines—similar to how financial powers regulated exchange rates in his past life. 

For instance, when the Purple Sky Sect, Beast Taming Valley, and Dry Cloud Pavilion dominated the Great Song's spirit stone mines, their production quotas for different grades directly influenced market rates. Some years, they deliberately mined fewer mid-grade stones and more low-grade ones to inflate exchange rates, then reversed the strategy the next year to depress them—effectively siphoning wealth from the broader cultivation community. 

It was exploitation in its purest form. 

The late Qi Zhong of the Dry Cloud Pavilion—whom Lin Shan had killed—hadn't been wrong: the righteous sects' hypocrisy was rampant. 

Still, the exchange rate between mid and low-grade stones rarely dipped below 1:100, making the Gongsun clan's offer exceedingly generous. 

Naturally, Lin Shan knew when to reciprocate. With a magnanimous wave, he declared: 

"After thorough inspection, this envoy confirms that the Gongsun clan indeed lacks the capacity to comply with the conscription order. A temporary deferment is warranted." 

He stopped short of an outright refusal—only the United Front Department had that authority—but his words bought the Gongsun clan time. The elders nodded, understanding the nuance. 

Tensions eased as everyone recognized the value of avoiding the frontlines. 

The meeting concluded amicably, with pleasantries exchanged. 

Second Elder Gongsun Lü informed Lin Shan that in three days, he and four clan members would descend into the earth veins to await the Spirit Vein Tide.

After Lin Shan departed, the elders' smiles vanished instantly, their gazes snapping to Gongsun Lü—their de facto leader. 

The Second Elder stroked his beard pensively, weighing his next move. 

One impatient elder broke the silence: "Are we truly giving one of our Spirit Vein Tide spots to that demonic brat?" 

His urgency stemmed from the fact that his nephew—the weakest among the pre-selected five—would likely be the one displaced. 

Gongsun Lü raised a calming hand, then inexplicably addressed the air behind him: 

"Immortal Qi arrived days ago and has observed long enough. What counsel does she offer?" 

The elders exchanged puzzled glances. 

A rustle sounded as a silver-robed woman in a veiled hat emerged from behind the curtains. She glided to the seat Lin Shan had occupied, her face obscured by the hat's white veil—impervious to spiritual probing. 

Her voice, clear as a lark's song, rang out: 

"Let him have the spot. Avoid unnecessary complications." 

The elders erupted. Who was this outsider privy to their secrets, making decisions for them? 

"Second Elder, who is she? Why bring her here?" 

"She eavesdropped on us—how did we not sense her?" 

"Gongsun Lü, this is a clan matter! What's the meaning of this?" 

Gongsun Lü massaged his temples. Since becoming Second Elder, he'd shouldered endless burdens—these old fossils, secluded in cultivation for centuries, had grown woefully inept at politics. 

Worse, they remained oblivious to external affairs, obsessed only with their own interests. 

Human nature was inherently selfish, and age only exacerbated it. 

"This is Immortal Qi, an envoy from the righteous Dry Cloud Pavilion, here to discuss cooperation." 

Uproar ensued. 

"What? A righteous sect envoy?" 

"Have you lost your mind?" 

"Gongsun Lü! We're in demonic territory! Colluding with the righteous means extermination!" 

Gongsun Lü sighed. He'd anticipated their reaction, but what choice did he have? 

The envoy had come uninvited. Just as they couldn't refuse the demonic envoy, they couldn't refuse this one either. 

After a millennium of righteous sect dominance, even their recent setbacks didn't diminish their overwhelming power. 

"Immortal Qi, if you'd clarify matters..." 

The veiled woman nodded curtly and cut to the chase: 

"The demonic sects are waning. Do you truly wish to perish with them? Even if you betray me now, the demonic Nascent Soul elders' paranoia will doom you regardless." 

"Cooperate, and you might survive. Refuse, and you certainly perish. Choose." 

The elders gaped like strangled ducks. 

Gongsun Lü spread his hands helplessly. 

"Uncles, the demonic sects will retreat eventually. Moreover, Immortal Qi's arrival was unforeseen. Our two Golden Core ancestors are in seclusion, leaving all decisions to us." 

The elders fell silent, their faces grim. 

The veiled woman pressed her advantage: 

"Why hesitate? Dry Cloud Pavilion and Beast Taming Valley will soon mobilize. With over a dozen Nascent Soul elders, the outcome is inevitable." 

Gasps filled the hall. 

"But what of the demonic allies—Lin Yu Zhai from the Southern Sea and the Yellow Spring Sect from Great Yan?" 

"If the demonic headquarters in Lu could reinforce them, the war would still be undecided!" 

The woman chuckled lightly. 

"And what if... the Lu headquarters faces its own crisis?" 

Dead silence. 

The implications were staggering. If true, the allies' withdrawal made sense. 

With the demonic sects fragmented and the righteous united, their defeat seemed imminent without external intervention. 

Seeing their hesitation, the woman added: 

"My elders promise that if the Gongsun clan defects, your past affiliations will be pardoned. You'll remain Shangdang's premier clan." 

"And I'll keep your Spirit Vein Tide secret." 

The elders turned to Gongsun Lü, who asked: 

"What does Dry Cloud Pavilion require of us?" 

The woman's hand closed around Lin Shan's abandoned teacup, still warm. 

"Prepare two to three hundred trusted clansmen. When the time comes, assist Elder Mang in deploying a one-time teleportation array."
