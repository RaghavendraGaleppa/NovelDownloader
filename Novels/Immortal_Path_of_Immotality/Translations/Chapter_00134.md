# Chapter 133: What Do You Want to Learn?

After some back-and-forth bickering, Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord finally renegotiated their contract:

[Lin Shan would help the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's avatar improve its strength as circumstances allowed, while the Black Skeleton Demon Lord would provide assistance in various areas as appropriate. Both parties were forbidden from harming or sabotaging each other.]

Given that the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had previously tampered with the contract, it agreed to compensate Lin Shan by helping him enhance his "soft skills" in advance.

"Brother, feel free to ask for whatever you need from me," the demon lord said amiably.

Though they had renewed their agreement, this contract didn't specify a timeframe. If Lin Shan kept delaying indefinitely, the demon lord would essentially be under house arrest with no recourse—hence its current cooperative attitude.

"Since you're a Nascent Soul expert, you must know some genuine divine abilities and spells. Teach me a couple," Lin Shan demanded without hesitation, seizing the opportunity to make extravagant requests while the demon lord was at a disadvantage.

"Do you think divine abilities grow on trees? I only know one myself, and I can't teach it to you," the demon lord replied.

"Why not?"

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord hopped back onto Lin Shan's shoulder, keeping its distance from the bone broth on the ground, and patiently explained, "My divine ability is an inherited secret art of the Skeleton race. It requires cultivation of a specific technique to perform, which your human cultivation method can't accommodate."

"Then teach me a couple of lesser divine abilities or spells," Lin Shan compromised.

"What's a 'lesser divine ability'?" The demon lord seemed confused.

In its world, there were only divine abilities and greater divine abilities. Lesser divine abilities—transitional techniques popular in this world—were unheard of in the other realms it had visited.

Lin Shan's expression darkened. This skull had crossed over with no cultivation base, no treasures, and couldn't even teach him a single spell. What use was keeping it around?

The demon lord's green soulfire flickered rapidly inside its skull as it scrambled to justify its worth. "Don't worry, brother. I still have my Nascent Soul cultivation experience. Even if our techniques differ, I can help you with most cultivation problems you might encounter."

"That was already part of the contract's exchange. How is that compensation now?"

"Then, are you interested in learning any of the Six Arts of Cultivation? I've lived for centuries and dabbled in all of them. I can easily help you get started."

"Oh? Tell me what you're best at."

Lin Shan's interest was piqued. Most cultivators began studying one or two of the Six Arts by the Foundation Establishment stage, as they were essential for both cultivation and combat.

"I excel at artifact forging. In my world, I was a renowned grandmaster whose reputation shook entire regions," the demon lord declared with pride.

"Not interested."

Lin Shan dismissed the idea outright. With his enhancement panel, he could eventually upgrade any treasure or spiritual artifact—why bother learning forging?

"How about talisman-making? I'm not a grandmaster, but I'm at the master level."

"Still not interested!"

Talismans could also be enhanced—no different from artifacts.

"Then what about formations?"

"Too expensive. Can't afford to learn."

"Alchemy?"

"Oh? You know alchemy?" Lin Shan perked up. That could be useful.

"Nope."

"Then why even bring it up?!"

After further discussion, it turned out the Black Skeleton Demon Lord specialized in artifact forging and dabbled in formations. It didn't even know talisman-making, let alone the other arts.

The problem was that Lin Shan didn't need forging, and formations were beyond his financial means. Formations required extensive knowledge of astronomy and geomancy, immense mental calculation and deduction abilities, and vast amounts of materials—resources typically only available to large sects supporting a handful of formation masters.

When had anyone seen a rogue cultivator dabbling in formations?

After a long stare-off, Lin Shan suddenly remembered something and pulled out a mid-grade magic tool—the Summoning Banner—from his storage pouch.

"Can you help me upgrade this to a high-grade magic tool?"

The mid-grade Summoning Banner could only summon Qi Condensation creatures, which was underwhelming for him. But a high-grade version capable of binding a Foundation Establishment summon would be a significant boost in combat power.

After a brief inspection, the demon lord clattered confidently. "A Summoning Banner, right? In my world, I commanded armies of millions of skeletons with these. I've used them countless times."

"Don't worry, brother. Though our worlds differ slightly, the principles behind these tools are similar. With the right materials, I can modify and upgrade it for you."

"Really?" Lin Shan was pleasantly surprised. He handed over his storage pouch for the demon lord to pick through, hoping to gather enough materials for the upgrade.

However, after rummaging through Lin Shan's meager possessions, the demon lord concluded that even with its grandmaster skills, there weren't enough suitable materials for the task.

Lin Shan then produced the storage bracelet he had taken from the deceased Turtle Sage. With the original owner dead, the bracelet's spiritual restrictions had weakened over time.

---

After half an hour of effort, Lin Shan finally broke the remaining seals and peered inside with his divine sense.

The sight nearly blinded him—countless rare materials, stacks of jade slips and ancient texts, an assortment of bizarre magical weapons, and a dazzling array of treasures filled the massive hundred-meter storage space.

The skull on his shoulder also peered in curiously. Though it had no cultivation base, it could still extend its divine sense. "Though these items aren't even a tenth of what my true form once possessed, they're an immense fortune for a Foundation Establishment cultivator like you."

"Seems you've stumbled upon quite the opportunity. Finding enough materials here shouldn't be a problem."

Lin Shan was still marveling at the contents. The Turtle Sage, a veritable tycoon of the Eastern Sea, had spent centuries amassing this wealth—only for it to fall into Lin Shan's hands.

Under Lin Shan's supervision, the demon lord quickly gathered the materials needed to upgrade the Summoning Banner—but then raised another issue.

"Brother, though I have my divine sense, I currently lack any magic power. Forging artifacts is beyond my capabilities in this state."

"What do you want?" Lin Shan eyed it warily.

Magic power was an evolution of spiritual energy, accessible only after the Golden Core stage. With the demon lord powerless, Lin Shan could easily control it. But if it regained Golden Core or even Nascent Soul strength, the contract—only binding at the Foundation Establishment level—might not prevent it from turning the tables.

"Relax! While there are plenty of materials in this bracelet, many of the rare demonic ingredients needed to restore my avatar to Golden Core strength are missing."

"For now, just restoring me to Foundation Establishment will suffice. You can gather the rest for me later."

Lin Shan considered this but remained cautious. The demon lord's true form was a Nascent Soul powerhouse. If its avatar regained Foundation Establishment strength, controlling it would be difficult—even with the contract.

"You can only restore yourself to Qi Condensation for now."

"But forging a high-grade magic tool requires Foundation Establishment power..."

The two locked eyes in yet another standoff. Lin Shan refused to yield, his gaze unrelenting. Finally, the demon lord conceded.

"Fine, Qi Condensation it is."

Hmph! Trying to trick me again? Lin Shan sneered internally. This ancient monster had played dumb earlier—did it think he'd fall for it twice?

While ordinary cultivators needed Foundation Establishment strength to forge high-grade magic tools, this was no ordinary being—it was a Nascent Soul skeleton!

Under Lin Shan's watchful eye, the demon lord reluctantly selected only a few materials for its restoration. Whether it had smuggled any extras, Lin Shan couldn't be sure—but he could intervene if it violated their agreement.

After assigning the demon lord a small cave to work in, Lin Shan dismissed it and turned his attention to the spoils from the Turtle Sage and his disciple.

With his enhancement panel, he didn't need anyone else to appraise the items—he was his own master appraiser!

Rubbing his hands together, Lin Shan gleefully began the beloved tradition of looting the dead.
