# Chapter 505: Shattered Realm

When the Lord of Ten Thousand Beasts first entered the immortal realm, he feared the established rules of the celestial world and dared not slaughter wantonly. Yet he devised his own methods—outwardly breeding immortal beasts and trading them, while secretly preying on rogue immortals and covertly destroying immortal sects. He captured all these celestial beings and confined them within his own domain, penning them like livestock.

He treated the immortals no better than pigs and dogs.
