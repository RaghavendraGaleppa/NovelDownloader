# Chapter 46: Moving Heaven and Earth, Rouge for a Life

“Uncle Wang, are you alright?”

Li Xian helped Wang Yonghou up, brushing the snow and sand from his clothes. Wang Yonghou supported his waist, groaning in waves of pain, his face bruised purple and green.

When he saw the large tear in his cloth robe, his heart ached as if it were bleeding. He would rather have taken a few more punches than have a hole torn in his clothes.

“I’m fine. Li… Li Xian, thank you.”

“I told you, you have promise. That martial arts display just now was incredibly impressive.”

“You really helped me vent my anger. Th… thank you.”

Suddenly, Wang Yonghou seemed to remember something and hurriedly said, “Th… that, I haven’t chopped any firewood yet. C… could you let Uncle Wang off this time?”

“I’m not going to hit you. Otherwise, wouldn’t Auntie Liu scold me to death?” Li Xian smiled.

Wang Yonghou finally relaxed. The two returned to Qingning County together.

“You, kid, your greatest strength is that you don’t forget your roots.”

Wang Yonghou sighed with emotion. Seeing him limping and struggling to walk, Li Xian bent down and adjusted his ankle bone. After it was set back in place, although it still hurt, he could walk properly.

“Those bastards really hit hard.”

“If you hadn’t come, I might have really ended up here.”

Wang Yonghou sucked in a cold breath.

Li Xian asked, “Uncle Wang, why were you stealing firewood? Didn’t you know how dangerous that is?”

“Sigh…” Wang Yonghou sighed. “What other choice did I have?”

“Your Auntie Liu fell ill a few days ago with a high fever that won’t break. The doctor said that if we can’t afford medicine, we at least have to make sure she doesn’t get cold.”

“Only then might she get better.”

“That doctor talks nonsense. It’s the dead of winter; who can avoid getting cold? He might as well let his own wife freeze to death, damn it.”

“I’m done, I’m done with it all.”

As he spoke, he began to sob, wiping his tears with his sleeve. But seeing the footprints on his clothes, he had a bitterness in his heart that he couldn’t speak of.

He swallowed all the bitterness.

Only a soft sigh escaped.

“Auntie Liu is sick?” Li Xian frowned.

At this time of year, ordinary people couldn’t afford to get sick. Young and strong people might be able to tough it out.

But for those a bit older, it was very likely they would get worse and worse and eventually die.

“It’s not strange to get sick with that evil wind blowing these past few days?” Wang Yonghou cursed. “That stinky woman, why did she have to get sick now, not earlier or later?”

“Made me take a beating for nothing.”

But Li Xian could see that the couple was actually very loving. Although Wang Yonghou cursed and swore, he still ran more than ten miles to steal firewood for Auntie Liu.

Unfortunately, his luck was bad, and he was caught.

Li Xian told Wang Yonghou that he happened to be going the same way and wanted to go see Auntie Liu with him. Wang Yonghou agreed.

In the Alley of Leaky Vases.

“Stinky woman, I’m back. Don’t you go dying on me,” Wang Yonghou shouted a few times.

A light cough came from inside the house. “You bastard, you’ll curse me to death,” Auntie Liu scolded weakly.

Wang Yonghou gently opened the door a crack and almost “crawled” into the room, trying to avoid letting the cold wind in. But the house was already freezing cold, so what difference did it make?

Li Xian also “crawled” into the house.

“Oh, it’s Little Xian?” Auntie Liu was startled, then hurriedly said, “Don’t get too close to me. It wouldn’t be good if I infected you.”

“Your Little Fan went to take the winter exam a while ago. Maybe when he comes back, he’ll have made a name for himself.”

Auntie Liu said with a smile.

Li Xian felt a bit sad. Ever since his father had died by suicide after falling into gambling debt, the two brothers had relied on each other to survive, and it was largely thanks to Auntie Liu’s occasional help.

Not to mention anything else, just the fact that they could borrow her stove was a kindness.

Every time the two brothers came to borrow the stove, Wang Yonghou would curse and swear, but Auntie Liu would make the decision herself and lend it to them.

“Auntie Liu, are you feeling any better?” Li Xian moved closer.

“Ah, this sickness…” Auntie Liu said. “Whether I can get better or not is uncertain.”

“Talking nonsense, you stinky woman, shut up,” Wang Yonghou cursed.

“Auntie Liu, what did the doctor say?” Li Xian touched her forehead to check her temperature and found his hand was very warm; she had a high fever.

“The doctor said I have a cold disease. If I had money, a few doses of herbal medicine could make me better. But where’s the money to be found?”

“And those doctors are so black-hearted. They say it’s hard to gather herbs in winter, so the medicine is expensive.”

When Auntie Liu said this, she suddenly saw the bruises on Wang Yonghou’s face and immediately sat up straight. “You old bastard, did you get beaten?”

“No… no…” Wang Yonghou shrank his neck.

“Did you go steal firewood?” Auntie Liu frowned. Although she was sick, she still had an imposing manner that made people afraid.

“Yes…” Wang Yonghou was very honest this time.

“Your clothes are torn,” Auntie Liu said heartbrokenly. “Come here, let me mend them for you.”

The couple was over fifty years old, with no children, but they treated each other with respect. At this moment, the scene of the injured husband and the sick wife leaning on each other and relying on each other also moved Li Xian.

“No matter how chaotic the world is, in some unknown corner, true feelings are always revealed.”

Li Xian watched silently, not wanting to disturb them.

He had no money on him, but he had a box of rouge, the one he had bought last time and hadn’t given to his wife.

His wife naturally looked down on this box of rouge.

But at this moment, it could save a life.

Li Xian turned and left, walking to the Dream Immortal Pavilion in Water Gauze Lane, and saw that seductive middle-aged woman again.

“Oh, young master, you’re not dead yet?”

The woman said with a smile.

“I’m here to pawn this rouge, it’s unopened,” Li Xian got straight to the point.

After some negotiation, the woman smiled. “Alright, this rouge cost you three taels of silver. I’ll only give you seven hundred wen for it.”

“Don’t say it’s too little. Seven hundred wen can save a life. Maybe even two.”

“You, when you sold yourself back then, it was only for a few hundred wen, right? If you agree, then it’s a deal. If you think it’s too little, go find another place.”

“After all, there are places to pawn jewelry, calligraphy, paintings, and bronze ware, but for rouge… except for this old lady’s kindness, no one else would bother with you.”

Li Xian nodded readily. “Deal!”

The woman smiled and brought over a cloth bag with seven hundred wen inside. Not a penny more, not a penny less.

“Madam, you’re usually not this easy to talk to.”

After Li Xian left, a servant at the Dream Immortal Pavilion couldn’t help but say.

“Get lost, get lost.”

“I like the look of him. If you were born as handsome as him.”

“Not to mention pawning rouge, even if he wanted this old lady, I might consider it.”

The servant, hearing this, hurriedly said, “No thanks, no thanks.”

The words had just left his mouth when two “slap, slap” sounds were heard, and two slaps landed on his face.

Slapping the servant’s face until it was swollen, the woman sneered. “You? You dare look down on me? Don’t know your place, do you?”

On the other side.

“Alright.”

Auntie Liu put away her needle and thread. Wang Yonghou’s clothes now had several patches.

“You, don’t go stealing firewood anymore.”

“We both know it. I probably won’t make it. Our child, the brothers in our family, how many have walked this way?”

“You need to be open-minded about it. It’s not a big deal.”

Auntie Liu gently patted her husband’s back.

“You stinky woman, if you’re gone, what’s the point of me living?”

“You said, usually, whether we’re hungry, miserable, or tired. We count the days, living day by day, isn’t that quite interesting?”

“But this… this…”

Wang Yonghou turned his head away, and the couple secretly shed tears.

Suddenly.

Auntie Liu saw an eye-catching pouch and patted her husband, signaling him to look.

Opening the pouch, they immediately saw seven hundred wen. Wang Yonghou was ecstatic. This sudden fortune was like saving both their lives.

“You stinky woman, you don’t have to die now. With money, we can buy medicine. With medicine, you’ll get better.”

“It must be that we… moved Heaven and Earth, haha.”

Wang Yonghou said happily.

“Ptooey, ptwey.”

“What do you mean we moved Heaven and Earth? I’m afraid this money…”

“Was… left by Little Xian.”

“It could only be him.”
