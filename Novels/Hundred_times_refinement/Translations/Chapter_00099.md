# Chapter 49: Safe Return to the Valley  

Lin Xuan then approached Yan Tianheng's corpse and eagerly began collecting the spoils of battle. Though the man had been cunning and ruthless, he was still the head of a prominent family, so his possessions surely wouldn't disappoint.  

From Yan Tianheng's body, Lin Xuan retrieved a storage bracelet. He channeled his spiritual sense into it and emptied its contents.  

Nine low-grade spirit stones, a bottle of Marrow-Cleansing Pills, and a jade slip—undoubtedly the intermediate cultivation technique Yan Tianheng had stolen from the Wang family disciples he ambushed. Additionally, there was a small cauldron.  

A bountiful haul!  

The nine spirit stones alone were enough to cover the cost of the talismans he had used. The jade slip's technique, being coveted by the Wang family, was certainly superior to the one he had purchased. While he had no shortage of Marrow-Cleansing Pills, this saved him the time needed to refine more. As for the cauldron, once removed from the storage bracelet, it exuded astonishing spiritual energy, its surface engraved with intricate patterns—clearly no ordinary item.  

Adding the Beast Soul Talisman to the tally, despite consuming nearly a hundred low-grade talismans in this battle, his gains far outweighed the losses.  

"Hmm? What's this?"  

Lin Xuan suddenly noticed a small box tucked away in the deepest corner of the storage bracelet. So inconspicuous, he had almost missed it.  

He retrieved it with his spiritual sense—a sandalwood-carved box with an antique charm. Opening the lid, he found a medicinal herb resting on a bed of brocade. Though it had been harvested some time ago, the herb remained fresh, emitting a faint, soothing fragrance. Though Lin Xuan didn't recognize it, he knew it must be rare and valuable.  

After carefully resealing the box, he stored it along with the other treasures in the storage bracelet. He then gathered the corpses of the Yan father and son and used a talisman imbued with the Quicksand Spell. The ground transformed into a swamp, swallowing the bodies without a trace before solidifying back into firm earth.  

Now, no one would ever know the Yan family's patriarch and his son had met their end here.  

With that done, Lin Xuan wasted no time lingering. Though the area was deserted, staying felt unwise. He activated his Wind-Riding Technique and traveled through the night.  

He covered over two hundred li in one go, stopping only at midnight to rest in a random cave. The next morning, he set off early and quietly returned to the Drifting Cloud Valley.  

He headed straight for Danxia Mountain and back to the abandoned pill refinery.  

"Immortal Master!"  

It was already noon, and the group of young attendants, led by Zhao Ming, were basking in the sun when they spotted Lin Xuan and hurriedly bowed in greeting.  

"Mm. Has anything happened recently?"  

"Rest assured, Immortal Master, all is well," Zhao Ming replied respectfully. He didn't dare ask why Lin Xuan had been gone for half a month—trouble came from speaking too much, and an immortal master's affairs were none of his concern.  

Lin Xuan was pleased with their discretion. "Good. Carry on with your tasks," he said with a nod before retreating to his room.  

The protective formations outside remained intact, confirming that no one had approached during his absence. The seclusion of the abandoned pill refinery was indeed advantageous—no disturbances, ample pills for cultivation, and a quiet place to train. His choice had been wise.  

Though this trip had been fraught with danger, the rewards were substantial. Aside from spirit stones and treasures, he had acquired three cultivation techniques. The issue of Spirit Control was resolved, and the *Soaring Cloud Art* was precisely what he needed right now.  

Though it was only a basic technique, it was highly regarded even by Foundation Establishment experts. Practicing it during the Qi Refining stage would not only accelerate progress but also lay a more solid foundation.  

The path of cultivation was long, and while the Qi Refining stage was the lowest, it was also the most crucial for building a strong base. A weak foundation would hinder future progress, whereas a solid one would yield increasing benefits.  

Lin Xuan didn't start cultivating immediately. Instead, he rested for a day to recover. His battle with the Yan father and son, though injury-free, had been taxing—Yan Tianheng was a peak Qi Refining cultivator, and even with talismans and artifacts, defeating him had been no easy feat.  

It had been a battle of wits as much as strength—feigning weakness, setting traps, and traveling through the night with barely an hour's rest. In such a fatigued state, cultivation would be inefficient. Lin Xuan knew better than to rush; haste made waste.  

After a long bath, he slept soundly from noon until dawn the next day. Waking refreshed, his energy and spiritual power fully restored, he was ready to begin his training.  

This journey had driven home the importance of spiritual power. In his battle with Yan Tianheng, the man had no remarkable artifacts aside from the Beast Soul Talisman, yet his sheer cultivation level allowed him to withstand Lin Xuan's barrage of talismans. Without strategy, victory would have been far harder.  

Artifacts were indeed powerful, but with his current fourth-layer cultivation, Lin Xuan could barely wield the mid-grade Golden Binding Rope. Had he possessed enough spiritual power to control the high-grade flying sword, Yan Tianheng would have been swiftly dispatched.  

No matter how many treasures one possessed, without sufficient spiritual power, their effectiveness was limited. Thus, his priority now was to enhance his strength. Techniques like Spirit Control could wait until he reached the later stages of Qi Refining.  

Reflecting on his experiences was one of Lin Xuan's strengths. This journey had taught him much—the arrogance of sects and cultivation families, the silent resentment of rogue cultivators. It reinforced the harsh truth of the cultivation world: strength dictated justice. In a world ruled by power, only by growing stronger could one avoid being trampled upon.
