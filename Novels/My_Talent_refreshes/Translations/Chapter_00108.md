## Chapter 108: Intrusion into the Restriction

Although Chu Ning didn't think much of it, he showed no expression. He readily accepted them all, then cupped his hands and said, "Thank you, Deacon Liao..."

"Ah, no need to thank me! If there's nothing else, I'll go to other places first." As Liao Yunming spoke, he stood up to leave.

Chu Ning, however, sighed and muttered, "Is Deacon Liao so busy? Never mind then. I originally wanted to ask the deacon for help. Regarding the Elementary Mid-Grade Talismans in the Spirit Talisman Codex, my talisman crafting success rate has already reached sixty percent. And they all say the quality of these talismans is extremely high, even better than those from Wind Gorge Valley. I wonder if the pavilion would want them."

Liao Yunming, who had just been about to step away, immediately retracted his foot. He looked at Chu Ning and asked in a daze, "What did you just say? Elementary Mid-Grade Talismans from the Spirit Talisman Codex, your crafting success rate has already reached sixty percent? And they're all high-quality ones?"

Chu Ning didn't answer, simply taking out a few talismans from his storage bag and handing them over. From the first day he had contact with talismans, he had shown excellent talisman crafting talent, and coupled with his performance in Yanji Market, everyone already knew. So, he wasn't afraid to display it. Besides, he hadn't told the other party that he could already craft Elementary High-Grade Talismans.

Liao Yunming took the talismans from Chu Ning's hand. Although they were all Elementary Mid-Grade Talismans, and he already knew Chu Ning could craft them, a hint of surprise still appeared on his face. The quality of these talismans was indeed top-tier; even if he crafted them himself, they wouldn't be any better. More importantly, Chu Ning actually claimed he could achieve a sixty percent success rate. This...

"Draw some talismans for me to see now," Liao Yunming said to Chu Ning very seriously.

Chu Ning naturally didn't refuse. He immediately took out a talisman brush and began to draw talismans from the Spirit Talisman Codex in front of Liao Yunming. Yin Thunder Talismans, Vajra Talismans, Earth Shield Talismans, Qi Concealment Talismans, Clear Wind Talismans, and even the Beast-Trapping Talisman that Liao Yunming had previously taught him, he drew them all. These talismans were extremely familiar to Chu Ning; he drew them daily. If he wanted to, he could completely achieve a success rate of over eighty percent. However, at this moment, to avoid being too shocking, he maintained it at around sixty percent.

But even so, it was enough to astonish Liao Yunming beyond measure.

"Your talisman crafting talent, tsk, tsk, I still underestimated it." Liao Yunming's face was filled with delight, even though he had already considered Chu Ning's talent to be exceptionally outstanding. Chu Ning's current performance still exceeded his expectations.

"Chu Ning, come here, come here!" Liao Yunming no longer mentioned leaving. "From now on, you will be a重點培养 disciple of my Spirit Talisman Pavilion. Stay in Yanji Market for a while, temper yourself, accumulate more resources, and raise your cultivation. As long as you enter the late stage of Qi Condensation, I will certainly pass on the more profound talisman crafting art, the Profound Talisman Treasure Codex, to you in the Spirit Talisman Pavilion. It records not only Elementary High-Grade Talismans but also the crafting methods for Mid-Grade and even High-Grade Talismans."

Upon hearing Liao Yunming's words, Chu Ning's heart pounded. He almost immediately wanted to ask if the Profound Talisman Treasure Codex could be passed on to him now. However, after thinking about it, he still didn't speak, merely sighing, "Deacon Liao, while that's true, it's still too dangerous outside the sect. If I hadn't happened to buy a Mid-Grade Talisman outside this time, plus having the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield given by Deacon He, I might have already lost my life to the Yin Demon Sect members."

Liao Yunming heard this and immediately waved his hand, saying, "Mid-Grade Talismans? We may not have much of anything else in our Spirit Talisman Pavilion, but we have plenty of talismans. Wait here."

With that, Liao Yunming turned and went upstairs to the second floor, then quickly came back down. "Here are five Mid-Grade Low-Tier offensive talismans, each with extraordinary power." Liao Yunming said, handing ten talismans to Chu Ning. "And here are five Mid-Grade Low-Tier defensive talismans. Take them. With these few talismans, even if a Qi Condensation Completion cultivator attacks, it will be difficult for them to directly break through your defense in a short time. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators might be able to be blocked."

Then, he took out a jade slip. "Here's an Elementary High-Tier Evasion Technique, its name is a bit ordinary, called 'Evasion Art'. However, this evasion technique is quite fast, probably twice as fast as your daily wind manipulation. Take it to cultivate, it'll give you another life-preserving skill."

Hearing this, Chu Ning immediately took them with a joyful expression. "Thank you, Deacon Liao."

Liao Yunming nodded, then took out a few small cloth bags from his storage bag. "Oh, right, Junior Brother He had something to attend to outside. He entrusted me to hand these few bags of spiritual plant seeds to you."

Chu Ning paused slightly but still reached out to take them. He had originally wanted to tell He Changyou that he seemed to have no courtyard in the outer sect, but now there was no need to find him. So, he brought it up with Liao Yunming directly.

Liao Yunming heard this and immediately waved his hand, saying, "That's no big deal. Our Spirit Talisman Pavilion still has a courtyard here." With that, he immediately called out to Tan Zhang. "Tan Zhang, bring a restriction token for one of the pavilion's empty courtyards in the outer sect."

A quarter of an hour later. When Chu Ning walked out of the Spirit Talisman Pavilion with the restriction token, Liao Yunming's face was beaming. "Old He, ah, Old He, I've done you a favor here. If this kid really returns to the sect after reaching the late stage of Qi Condensation, he'll be a member of my Spirit Talisman Pavilion."

After leaving the Spirit Talisman Pavilion, Chu Ning still headed towards the Spiritual Plant Hall. He had originally prepared to look for He Changyou, but since the other party wasn't there, Chu Ning naturally had no need to specifically find him. However, Chu Ning had also brought back quite a few spiritual plants this time, which he needed to hand over to the sect to offset his monthly dues. Fortunately, there were dedicated personnel in the Spiritual Plant Hall to handle such matters, so He Changyou's absence had no impact.

After settling this matter, Chu Ning returned to the outer sect and found the courtyard indicated on the restriction token. He was somewhat surprised to find that it wasn't far from Mu Ling's residence. But then he thought about it and it wasn't strange; after all, Mu Ling was also from the Spirit Talisman Pavilion. It was normal for courtyards of the same pavilion to be close. He had thought of going to greet Mu Ling but found that she wasn't there. So, he gave up on the idea.

He directly went into his own courtyard and looked around. The layout was similar to Mu Ling's previous one. Since he would be returning in two days, Chu Ning had no mind to fuss with the courtyard now. He found a room, cleaned it simply with a few spells, then came to the courtyard. He prepared to start studying the items he had acquired today.

As he picked up the Earth Spirit Bracelet, Chu Ning also took out a large piece of Earth Spirit Crystal from his storage bag. Then, he casually took out a small jade knife from his storage bag. He had prepared this item before going to Yanji Market; it was mainly used for cutting certain special spiritual plants. He picked up the jade knife, looked at the size required for inlaying on the Earth Spirit Bracelet, and began cutting the Earth Spirit Crystal. In a short while, a small piece of Earth Spirit Crystal was cut off.

Chu Ning embedded it into the Earth Spirit Bracelet. When he tried to cut the second piece, he stopped. He still wanted to test the power of the Earth Spirit Bracelet, but the Earth Spirit Crystal was indeed very precious, and using too much would be too wasteful. He'd just put in one piece for now.

Chu Ning put down the jade knife in his hand and released Little White from his spirit beast pouch. He prepared to have the little fellow unleash an offensive spell for him to see. This little fellow had actually advanced to First-Tier Advanced, and in terms of level, it could already be equivalent to a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator. Considering that spirit beasts and demonic beasts generally had somewhat higher strength than ordinary cultivators at the same level, having this little fellow test the power was perfect.

"Little White, I'll activate my defense later, you try casting a spell at me." Chu Ning said to Little White, while infusing spiritual energy, directly activating the Earth Spirit Bracelet in his hand. An earthen yellow light barrier was immediately activated, protecting Chu Ning's entire body.

Seeing this, Little White opened its mouth and spat out a white ice-element spell that shot towards Chu Ning.

"Pop!"

The spell struck the yellow light barrier. The barrier merely rippled slightly before returning to normal. Seeing this, Chu Ning's eyes immediately lit up. Little White's spell attack this time had reached the attack standard of an ordinary Qi Condensation eighth-layer cultivator. And Chu Ning felt that this defensive barrier could withstand at least five such attacks. It was important to note that only one Earth Spirit Crystal had been used so far. If he were to add nine more Earth Spirit Crystals, the defensive power would double. Then, Qi Condensation Completion cultivators wouldn't even dream of easily breaking through the defense. As for Foundation Establishment cultivators, Chu Ning wasn't sure.

Thinking of this, Chu Ning immediately withdrew his spiritual energy. However, the barrier remained, clearly powered by the Earth Spirit Crystal's spiritual energy. This continued for about half a quarter of an hour before the spiritual energy barrier finally dissipated. During this time, Chu Ning had already cut off ten more small pieces of Earth Spirit Crystal. When the spiritual energy barrier dissipated, Chu Ning immediately inlaid all ten of these Earth Spirit Crystals.

Little White, meanwhile, looked very curious about its new environment, its small eyes darting around. While Chu Ning was doing all this, it wandered here and there in the courtyard, occasionally looking in different directions.

After Chu Ning finished arranging all ten Earth Spirit Crystals, Little White ran to Chu Ning's side. With a "Ying," it barked towards a certain direction.

"Little White, that place is the inner sect, so the spiritual energy is naturally abundant." Chu Ning smiled at Little White.

At this moment, Little White suddenly barked "Ying" again towards another direction. Hearing this sound, Chu Ning glanced in that direction, then looked at Little White with some surprise.

"You mean the spiritual energy in that place is also very abundant?" Chu Ning's eyebrows twitched slightly. "That's not right, is it? According to the direction, that place should be a relatively outer position of the outer sect, almost outside the mountain range. How could the spiritual energy there be even denser?" Thinking this, Chu Ning looked at Little White with some suspicion. "Little White, you didn't sense it wrong, did you?"

"Ying!" Little White barked back at Chu Ning indignantly.

Chu Ning finished listening and smiled, "Okay, okay, you didn't sense it wrong, I misspoke."

"Ying!" Little White barked again, and surprisingly, it started to walk directly outside.

"Follow me!" Hearing Little White's sound, Chu Ning shook his head. "Forget it, Little White. This is within the sect; we can't just wander around freely. It wouldn't be good if we ended up in some senior's immortal's cave."

Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, Little White barked "Ying" again. However, seeing that Chu Ning was truly unwilling to follow it, Little White lazily flopped down.

Chu Ning continued to look at the items he had acquired today. He took out the Blazing Flame Bracelet. This magic artifact didn't seem to have any other special tricks; it could be used simply by infusing spiritual energy. As Elder Tong had said, it had two attack methods. Chu Ning wore the Earth Spirit Bracelet on his left hand and this offensive Blazing Flame Bracelet on his right. At this point, he already had an idea for combining it with his existing attack methods. Long-range attacks were easy to explain: when there was no opportunity to use the Divine Wood Longbow, he could use this magic artifact to emit fire blades. And if an enemy approached him, or if he approached an opponent using Thunderbolt Steps, he could try activating the Blazing Flame Bracelet first, using its blazing flames to break through the opponent's defense. Then, he could follow up with the Heavenly Gang Fist, which would undoubtedly make the attack even more powerful.

At the same time, Chu Ning also took out the few Mid-Grade Low-Tier Talismans Liao Yunming had given him. They truly had talismans of various attributes, just as the deacon had said. Chu Ning was very satisfied and carefully put them away one by one.

However, when he picked up the spiritual plant seeds that Liao Yunming had supposedly passed on from He Changyou, Chu Ning couldn't help but pout. This time, Deacon He was not generous at all. Spiritual plant seeds like the Golden Yuan Fruit were quite good for him before he went to Yanji Market. But now, for Chu Ning, they no longer held any appeal. Clearly, this deacon of the Spiritual Plant Hall had underestimated Chu Ning's current wealth and abilities.

Chu Ning put these things into his storage bag. Having nowhere else to go for a while, he simply returned to his room and began cultivating. There were no spiritual plants here to assist in cultivating the Azure Wood Spring Bloom Art, but fortunately, Chu Ning still had Spirit Essence Pills, so it didn't affect him much. After consuming a Spirit Essence Pill, Chu Ning cultivated for half a day until he had completely digested its medicinal effect, then he stopped.

Chu Ning was too lazy to cook at this point. He took a Grain Abstinence Pill, ate some spiritual fruits, and continued cultivating. The Azure Wood Everlasting Spring Cultivation Technique, Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art, and Spirit Refining Art, rotating through them wasn't boring.

He cultivated until evening. When he finished the last round of Spirit Refining Art, Chu Ning tried extending his spiritual sense and found that his spiritual sense could faintly reach an 8 zhang range, making him very satisfied.

The next moment, Chu Ning's expression changed slightly. Little White, that little fellow, had disappeared. He had been cultivating all day, and Chu Ning habitually left Little White in the courtyard. But now, it was nowhere to be seen. Chu Ning quickly exited the room into the courtyard, looked carefully around, but still couldn't find it. His gaze towards outside the courtyard immediately grew worried. "That little fellow wouldn't go stir up some trouble, would it?"

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, Little White drilled directly through the courtyard's restriction and came in. Chu Ning sighed slightly in relief. But the next moment, his eyes suddenly widened. Little White was clutching a red spiritual fruit the size of half a fist in its mouth, and came scurrying to Chu Ning's side.

"You... where did you get that from?" Chu Ning looked at the little fellow, suddenly feeling a headache. This was within the sect; if there was a spiritual fruit, it must have been planted by some senior. And now Little White had just stolen one and brought it back...

Chu Ning quickly stepped forward and took the spiritual fruit in his hand. Then, nervously, he asked Little White, "Did you eat it?"

"Ying!" Little White shook its head.

"Good that you didn't eat it," Chu Ning sighed in relief slightly. "Now quickly take it back."

Little White, however, barked "Ying" at Chu Ning. "Come together, no one's there."

No one? Chu Ning's eyebrows twitched. Had some senior gone out?

"Ying, ying!" Little White barked a few more times. Combining this with the little fellow's telepathic message, Chu Ning spent a little time and asked a few more questions, finally understanding what it wanted to express. Little White said it had obtained the fruit from the mountain in the direction it mentioned yesterday, where the spiritual energy was quite abundant. And that place was not an immortal's cave, nor did it have any spiritual fields or the like. Instead, it was an entire mountain range.

However, upon hearing Little White actually tell him to go there. Chu Ning still shook his head and said, "Forget it. Since it's a place within the sect, we shouldn't trespass carelessly. Since you found this spiritual fruit, I'll let you eat it." Saying that, Chu Ning threw the spiritual fruit back to Little White.

"Ying!"

Little White barked, gripped the spiritual fruit, but didn't eat it immediately. Instead, it swiftly rushed out.

"Little White!" Chu Ning immediately shouted upon seeing this.

But Little White paid no heed, rushing out even faster. Chu Ning, seeing this, quickly chased after it. Little White had already sprinted far away in a flash. Since breaking through to First-Tier Advanced demonic beast, its speed had become even faster. Chu Ning, at Qi Condensation seventh layer cultivation, couldn't catch up at all even with wind manipulation. Even a Beast-Trapping Talisman wouldn't reach it anymore. Within the outer sect, the use of flying artifacts was prohibited. At this moment, Chu Ning could only curse inwardly while chasing after it with wind manipulation. Fortunately, it was already night, and there was no one outside. Moreover, the deacons of various halls would also return to the inner sect, so the man and beast went unnoticed.

Little White only stopped when they reached the edge of the outer sect.

"Ying!"

At this moment, the spiritual fruit had already been ingested. Little White barked at Chu Ning, simultaneously sending a telepathic message.

"There's a restriction?"

Chu Ning wasn't surprised to hear this. This could very well be the edge of the sect's protective restriction. After all, beyond this point, they would be outside the range of the mountain gate. Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately sent a telepathic message back to Little White, "Alright, this is a sect restriction, we can't touch it casually. Let's go back."

As he spoke, Chu Ning squatted down, reaching out to grab it. Just then, a white light suddenly emitted from Little White's head, enveloping Chu Ning within it. The next moment, Little White's body shot forward, carrying Chu Ning within the white light, and directly rushed into the restriction.
