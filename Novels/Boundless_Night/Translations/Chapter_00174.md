# Chapter 174: Qin Ming's Instant Kill

To Qin Ming, this was a desperate situation, an unprecedented life-and-death tribulation. Even exotic gold, a material akin to immortal artifacts, couldn't pierce the old woman's skull. Yet, his own blood was already splattering!

During his sixth rebirth, a strange light was born within him. Regardless of his own state, even if he was at rock bottom in terms of weakness, he could still unleash it, equivalent to a peak attack, intimately connected to Celestial Light. Unfortunately, after using it once, it would take him a long time to recover that light. During his seventh rebirth, a golden glow emerged within his body, like a shattered great sun mixed with light mist, closely resembling Pure Yang Consciousness Spirit-light.

The two lights within his body blossomed one after another; this was a relay attack. Just now, the golden glow in Qin Ming's body, like a golden blazing sun reassembling, shone through the pitch-black clouds. He wielded the white sword-shaped pendant with "Pure Yang Blazing Sun," stabbing it deep into the old woman's forehead. Even with his full might, he only managed to push it in slightly, unable to truly pierce her skull. Similarly, this "Blazing Sun" born during the seventh rebirth could only last for an instant. After a single use, it would take a long time to recover.

Qin Ming sighed, retrieved the exotic gold short sword, and used the last vestiges of Pure Yang radiance to slash at the old woman's body. During this process, his body was crisscrossed with terrifying cracks from top to bottom, almost translucent. He had been torn apart.

Qin Ming was effectively instantly killed! He used the exotic gold short sword, but couldn't even budge the old woman. Moreover, this was a surprise attack. Qin Ming didn't mobilize his Celestial Light energy; he used a special ability directly without any warning, making it impossible to guard against. In the Nascent stage, most of these accompanying "abilities" were rather useless. However, the two abilities he consecutively developed were both incredibly potent, each equivalent to his strongest attack!

The old woman was merely inches away from him, and hadn't unleashed her Celestial Light in advance. She was indeed struck initially, but her body's instinctive reaction instantly changed the course of the battle. Exotic gold weapons were known for specifically breaking Celestial Light and Divine Intellect, but here, they were useless, instinctively neutralized and blocked by the old woman's body in an instant. However, Qin Ming's two abilities, wielding the exotic gold short sword, still had some effect; after all, it had initially pierced her forehead.

The old woman shrieked, her vision momentarily blurring. Although her instinctive reaction "instantly killed" her opponent and protected herself from further injury, the brain was different from other places. Many things could happen in the single breath she was disoriented. For example, she had already fallen from the clouds!

Qin Ming let out a bitter laugh, feeling like he was about to die. Was this the pressure of the Third Realm? He had exhausted all his strength, yet he was still like an ant trying to shake a tree. And this was just an old woman in the early Spirit Field stage, who had made no further progress since entering this domain. No matter how much he attacked, he couldn't shake her.

Qin Ming's blood dyed the cloud mist red as he rapidly plummeted. His body was riddled with hundreds of dense cracks, like an exquisite porcelain vase shattered and then reassembled. He had indeed been torn apart just now. At the last moment, he used his cohesive force to forcibly bind his flesh, preventing it from disintegrating and maintaining his human form. Otherwise, there might already be many scattered chunks of flesh and blood falling from the sky.

Qin Ming realized that his Silk Codex Art, which integrated various Celestial Light energies, fused with some Consciousness Spirit-light, and devoured the Divine Intellect he had painstakingly cultivated, was not useless; it actually possessed a certain "divine peculiarity." For example, last time, his entire Celestial Light power had actually condensed with his mental consciousness, becoming inseparable, and together, they entered the giant centipede's divine kingdom. And now, too, his body was almost dismembered and torn into pieces. If it were other Celestial Light energies, they would have been unable to circulate smoothly, leading to an inevitable and tragic death by explosion. Qin Ming's Celestial Light, fused with Divine Intellect and Consciousness Spirit-light, was like a part of his flesh, blood, and spirit, and could still be used, thus adhering his shattered body together.

However, his condition was utterly dreadful! At this moment, he was on the brink of despair, already seeing the abyss of death, with most of his body already falling into it.

"You beast!" the old woman shrieked in the night sky, her face twisted and terrifying, stained with blood flowing from her forehead. She was consumed by rage and anxiety. A dignified expert of the Spirit Field realm had been injured by a nascent cultivator, her consciousness momentarily "blacking out," causing her to fall from the cloud. To her, this was an insult, like a lion tripped by a grasshopper, and then falling flat on its face, covered in blood.

"You old hag!" Qin Ming gritted his teeth, never having felt such resentment before. The Cui family was like a haunting ghost, constantly appearing around him, bringing him deadly threats. At the same time, he also felt humiliated and profoundly powerless. He had been instantly killed by the opponent's Spirit Field and the instinctive release of Celestial Light, blasted far away. It was good that he was this far, otherwise, once the old woman regained consciousness, even in the night sky, she would immediately seize him and exact bloody revenge.

The only intact part of Qin Ming's body was his head, because at the critical moment, he had used that tattered cloth to block in front of him. In addition, he was much higher than the old woman, so his head was not shattered when her Spirit Field and Celestial Light surged out.

"I've practically died once!" Qin Ming was in excruciating pain. His flesh was forcibly pieced together. Without the Celestial Light energy fused with Consciousness Spirit-light and Divine Intellect, he would disintegrate at any moment.

"Qin Ming, you are excellent, worthy of being someone cultivated by my Cui family. To be able to injure me in the Nascent stage, good, let's have a good 'chat' on the ground!" The old woman had recovered and was fine. The exotic gold short sword piercing her forehead couldn't kill her. At this moment, her eyes were like lightning, seeing the young man in the distance. Her body hunched, her expression sinister and cold, staring intently in his direction.

"The Cui family has brought me so much pain, and yet you're so shameless. Fine, I'll remember all of this!" Qin Ming mumbled weakly. He didn't want to bother with the old woman. His true power couldn't shake the Cui family; anything he said would be useless.

"Whether you live or die, you bear the mark of my Cui family. We raised you, and before we could let you be a young master, and in the future, we can still treat you as a 'bondservant.' Do you think you can break free?" The old woman emphasized the words "bondservant," which angered Qin Ming. It was one thing to target him, but to humiliate his family as well.

"An unending feud!" Qin Ming uttered these four words, a trickle of blood appearing at the corner of his mouth again.

The old woman sneered, saying, "See you on the ground!" She reached for her parachute, casting a cold glance in his direction. However, the next moment, she was stunned, realizing something terrible had happened! Immediately, she shrieked in horror, "No!" She pulled the parachute cord, but what emerged was a tattered net. Was this even a parachute? It was a fishing net, completely unusable.

"Ah..." She screamed miserably, despair showing on her face. What could she do now? "You!" She realized something, looking across at him. Two silver streaks of lightning shot from her old eyes, seeing him grimace in pain, yet smiling coldly at her.

"Seeing you like this, I feel relieved." Qin Ming's parachute had already opened, his voice coming from above. He and Li Qingyun had experienced a bird-fall incident before, which left him with psychological trauma, so he brought several extra parachutes. In fact, it was precisely because of this that his life was saved this time. His other parachutes were all shattered, only the one on his head was preserved, and he was now painfully wearing it. After this incident, Qin Ming's psychological trauma from falling intensified several times over.

The old woman was terrified and utterly desperate. Even as an expert of the Spirit Field realm, she couldn't withstand such a fall; she would die a very miserable death. She understood now that in that moment her consciousness blurred, the opponent, unable to pierce her body with the exotic gold short sword, had instead shredded her escape parachute.

"Who can save me?!" Even a Spirit Field expert was a mortal, capable of fear and terror. In her final moments, she was no different from an ordinary person. In the night mist, besides the old woman disappearing, a five-colored bottle also vanished from sight. That bottle contained Celestial Light Liquid!

He withdrew his gaze, unsure if he could survive. Because he had never been so severely injured before. Upon careful introspection, Qin Ming clearly discovered that all the bones in his limbs and torso were broken, not a single one intact. Most terrifyingly, his five vital organs were also torn apart, split into many pieces. Although they were pieced back together, his bodily functions and once-vibrant vitality had plummeted to rock bottom. Overall, when the opponent's Spirit Field and Celestial Light expanded, he was like being ripped apart by a pair of giant hands, and also like being struck by many blades. His entire body, front and back, was riddled with over a hundred translucent wounds, crisscrossing everywhere. How could a normal Nascent stage cultivator possibly survive this?!

"I still have so many things left undone. If I die like this, my life will be full of regrets," he murmured softly. But the cruel reality was before him: his heart was shattered into more than a dozen pieces. Even if pieced together, it was only faintly trembling. How could he possibly live on?!

Qin Ming felt bitter and desperate. Past scenes flashed before his eyes, those people, those events, all passing through his mind like an electric current. They say that when a person is about to die, their life's experiences flow by in an instant. He felt he might have reached that point.

"Grandpa, even now, I don't know where you went, or if you're still alive."
"Parents, I have no impression of you at all. I don't know if you're still in this world. I might go before you."
"Cui family, get lost. Don't come to occupy my last precious moments!"
"Double Trees Village, alas, I can't go back."
"Uncle Meng, Elder Li, I have failed your hopes. I am but a small nascent cultivator, unable to stir up any waves on this path."
"Qingyue, be careful of other immortal seeds in the Pure Land, and those shameless old seniors. I hope you rise up with radiant light and stand at the peak of the immortal path, but it seems I won't see that day."
"Ning Siqi, you must become a god. Li Qingxu, it's a pity I didn't get a chance to smash your dog head. Cui Chonghe, what kind of immortal will you become? It's a shame I don't have time to challenge you at the Cui family's doorstep..."

Qin Ming was descending, his consciousness still clear, but his body was about to give out. He maintained it with a special Celestial Light energy to prevent it from disintegrating. His heart, spleen, liver, lungs, kidneys, etc., after being shattered into many pieces, even when pieced together, showed no sign of recovery and had completely stopped functioning. How could he live? Death would come eventually; it was only a matter of time.

He tried various methods. The Fate Altering Scripture could prolong life, but it wouldn't have an immediate effect. The Thunderfire Internal Refinement Method was out of the question; he was too weak to handle it. More importantly, doing so might directly shock him to death, his flesh exploding. As for the Silk Codex Art, it also seemed powerless at the moment.

In the night mist, he caught a glimpse of a dazzling blue light, which immediately made his chest feel constricted. That was the mineral essence he had preserved for a long time. Back then, he had fallen into a fissure in the black and white mountain, irradiated by Celestial Light, his entire body turning black, almost dying. He had discovered this item on a nearby corpse. In the Nascent stage, as long as one hadn't reached the ninth rebirth, taking it for the first time could improve one's physique, and there was a fifty percent chance of undergoing another rebirth, purely based on luck. Therefore, Qin Ming had kept it until now to maximize its effect. The main reason was also that he hadn't lacked spiritual substances for rebirth previously. Moreover, Qin Ming's body also had its limits. Although he wasn't blocked by the restriction of only being able to undergo five rebirths a year, after his seventh rebirth, he hadn't "recovered" yet.

Now, the thumb-sized crystal bottle shattered, and the blue liquid spilled out, which he confined to his body surface with cohesive force. "I haven't even tasted it yet!" Qin Ming was truly unwilling. Should he drink it now? But mineral essence had to be consumed when the body was in its best state, otherwise, it might backfire and harm him. Back when he was seriously ill, it was because of this condition that he dared not take it.

At this moment, his heart had stopped beating. He carefully checked, and his lungs had also failed; he was no longer breathing! This caused Qin Ming's expression to freeze. Was his physical body dead? He felt his facial muscles growing numb. Was he about to completely lose consciousness? This was truly a crushing and despairing outcome.

"Might as well give me a quick death!" Qin Ming realized that the reason he hadn't died immediately was probably related to the various purple mists, golden glows, and silver lights he had absorbed on that mountain. Within his body, wisps of light mist were swirling.

"Hmm, what's that?" Suddenly, he saw a "silver disc" hanging in the distant sky! This... how remarkably similar it was to the moon described in ancient texts? He was stunned. Where was this place?

Soon after, Qin Ming landed. Although he had a parachute, the impact once again caused severe bleeding throughout his body, nearly making him explode again. He lay on the ground, his heart not beating, no breath, looking at the surrounding scenery. He felt it was surreal; there really was a moon in the distance. This area was bathed in a hazy, bright moonlight, completely different from the dark world he usually saw!

"Where have I arrived?" Qin Ming, on the verge of death, was filled with confusion.
