# Chapter 65: Earth Demon Spiritual Treasure and Sword Seal  

"Trade?"  

Gu Yuan was slightly surprised by the proposal.  

Without keeping him waiting, the old ape reached into its abdomen and retrieved a crimson jade slip.  

"I know the Dao Academy possesses countless secret techniques and divine arts, but this jade slip of mine is no ordinary item—it contains a superior-grade Sword Seal!"  

"How about we make a trade with this Sword Seal?" the old ape said, pointing at the jade slip with a solemn expression.  

A Sword Seal?!  

Gu Yuan's interest was immediately piqued.  

Among the myriad of magical seals in the world, the Sword Seal was universally acknowledged as the most lethal—feared for its formidable power and unparalleled speed. The most renowned seal in the Azure Peak Dao Academy was the Golden Radiance Great Sword Seal.  

Gu Yuan had seen this seal in the Transmission Hall, but its cultivation requirements were too stringent, so he hadn't chosen it at the time. There were other Sword Seals available, but due to his spiritual limitations, he had passed on them as well—a decision he now somewhat regretted.  

Unfortunately, gaining access to the Transmission Hall wasn't easy. Over the past year, he had been wholly focused on cultivation and hadn't completed any missions from the Fate Hall, leaving him without the contribution points needed to re-enter.  

Yet now, unexpectedly, he had encountered a Sword Seal in the possession of an old ape.  

What a pleasant surprise.  

But what exactly did the old ape want in exchange?  

The value of a superior-grade Sword Seal was immense—comparable to a top-tier magical artifact, if not more.  

"Elder, please speak plainly," Gu Yuan urged.  

"Ah!" The old ape sighed, looking at the jade slip in its hand and then at the burly golden-backed ape beneath it. "To be honest with you, Young Immortal, our golden-backed ape clan was taken in by the Dao Academy and allowed to reside on Spirit Crane Island, sheltered from external calamities. All we had to do was brew wine to live peacefully—a life that was already quite fortunate for a small clan like ours."  

"However, though Spirit Crane Island is a good place, it is also a shackle that restrains our potential."  

"Big Baby here was born with dual pupils, a sign of exceptional talent. He has already touched the threshold of becoming an Earth Demon. But Spirit Crane Island lacks the spiritual treasures needed for Earth Demon ascension. Without them, breaking through is nearly impossible!"  

As it spoke, the old ape's face was filled with sorrow.  

The golden-backed ape beneath it grew anxious, patting the old ape's back as if urging it not to grieve.  

The old ape patted the golden-backed ape's shoulder reassuringly before turning back to Gu Yuan with a sincere expression.  

"Thus, I wish to ask a favor of you, Young Immortal."  

"Could you purchase an Earth Demon spiritual treasure for Big Baby?"  

An Earth Demon spiritual treasure?  

So the old ape wanted to help this golden-backed ape ascend to Earth Demon status?  

Gu Yuan suddenly understood.  

Spirit Crane Island was home to many spirit beasts, but very few ever broke through to the Earth Demon realm.  

The primary reason was the lack of "spiritual treasures."  

Much like cultivators needing specific resources to reach the Foundation Establishment stage, spirit beasts required unique spiritual treasures to refine their bodies and form an "Earth Demon Bone" to ascend.  

This step was fraught with difficulties—requiring not only opportunity, resources, and innate talent but also a stroke of luck. Countless spirit beasts and cultivators remained stuck at this bottleneck.  

Though the golden-backed ape had decent talent, by the standards of the Dao Academy, it was merely average.  

The academy would never invest resources in a single golden-backed ape.  

Moreover, the spiritual treasures on Spirit Crane Island belonged to the Dao Academy—public property. No cultivator would go out of their way to help a spirit beast obtain such treasures for its breakthrough.  

Why waste resources on a spirit beast when they could be used to nurture one's own descendants?  

After all, this wasn't their clan's guardian spirit beast.  

Thus, if the golden-backed ape wanted to break through, it had to rely on itself.  

However, though Spirit Crane Island was vast, it didn't naturally produce spiritual treasures. External assistance was necessary.  

And spiritual treasures were precious. Even if the golden-backed apes could brew monkey wine, it wouldn't be enough to afford one.  

But this micro spirit stone mine had given the old ape a glimmer of hope.  

Yet... without the help of a human cultivator, even having spirit stones was useless, as the apes couldn't leave the island.  

For some time, the old ape had discreetly instructed its clan to mine the ore while cautiously observing the cultivators on Spirit Crane Island, hoping to find a reliable partner to help purchase the spiritual treasure.  

But... wealth could tempt even the virtuous, and the golden-backed apes' status was far beneath that of human cultivators. Thus, the old ape had remained cautious, never revealing its intentions, only watching from the shadows.  

Gu Yuan's arrival had filled the old ape with both alarm and delight.  

Alarm, because its secret mining operation had been discovered.  

Delight, because this human cultivator was cunning—he had no intention of reporting it to the Dao Academy, only of keeping the spoils for himself.  

A cunning mind was good. It meant they could collaborate.  

Most importantly, this cultivator was shrewd but not greedy, with sharp judgment. Though he could have easily killed the lower and mid-tier spirit apes, he had only wounded them—clearly leaving room for negotiation.  

He was familiar with the Dao Academy's laws but not bound by them. His methods were formidable, yet he knew how to leverage circumstances. His heart didn't seem entirely wicked either.  

Having discovered the mine's secret, he was the perfect partner.  

Thus, the old ape decided to lay its cards on the table and take a gamble—proposing a trade with Gu Yuan.  

"This Sword Seal is of superior quality and will surely be of great use to you, Young Immortal!"  

"I offer this Sword Seal as compensation, asking only that you purchase an Earth Demon spiritual treasure for my clan!"  

The old ape spoke earnestly once more.  

The value of a superior-grade Sword Seal was at least several hundred spirit stones. Combined with the fifty-fifty split from the mine, Gu Yuan stood to gain nearly two thousand spirit stones—a massive windfall.  

However, procuring an Earth Demon spiritual treasure wasn't so simple.  

There were considerable risks involved. Those capable of purchasing such treasures were likely formidable cultivators or spirit beasts, making the endeavor perilous.  

But if successful, the goodwill of an Earth Demon-level spirit beast would be invaluable.  

Once it broke through, the golden-backed ape clan's status within the Dao Academy would rise, possibly even earning them their own island to expand their lineage.  

As the Rogue Cultivator's Manual said: "Those skilled in killing must also forge connections. With many friends, one need not fear the vengeance of the slain."  

After a moment of contemplation, Gu Yuan replied, "I can agree to this, but the timing of the purchase will be at my discretion. This matter isn't simple and requires careful planning."  

"There's also significant risk involved, so I'll take an additional hundred spirit stones."  

"However, I can provide you with mining tools and extra storage pouches to speed up your extraction and conceal your activities."  

Since this was a negotiation and he held the upper hand, it was only natural to maximize his gains.  

"Excellent! Careful planning is indeed necessary!"  

"Big Baby has only just touched the threshold—he still needs time to cultivate. There's no rush!"  

"As for the hundred spirit stones, that's no problem!"  

The white old ape burst into laughter upon hearing Gu Yuan's agreement, stroking its beard in delight.  

The very reason it had chosen Gu Yuan was his prudence and caution.  

Even losing an extra hundred spirit stones was inconsequential.  

From the spirit stone mine, it would still receive over fourteen hundred spirit stones. Combined with the monkey wine, it could still afford the spiritual treasure.  

"Young Immortal, your decisiveness is commendable. This old one won't be stingy—consider this Sword Seal your deposit!"  

"You may also take half of the already-mined spirit stones!"  

Lacking any means to bind Gu Yuan to his word, the white old ape could only rely on sincerity.  

With that, it tossed the jade slip directly to Gu Yuan.
