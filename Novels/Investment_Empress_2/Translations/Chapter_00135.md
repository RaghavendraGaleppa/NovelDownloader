# Chapter 135: The Great Battle, Whack-a-Mole, and Yin Huaxuan Enters the Fray

The middle-aged Han Zhen had never expected this.

The Blood Phoenix Essence contained the accumulated blood essence of countless living beings. This power was something even a Divine Observation Realm expert could not fully control.

He was no exception.

That was why he had taken a different path, refining his own remains.

But Ying Bing...

She had directly caused these blood essences to combust, causing her aura to rise rapidly.

The connection between the Blood Phoenix Essence and him had not been severed. Why had it abandoned him to submit so meekly to Ying Bing?!

Peak of the Profound Core Realm...

One orifice of the Divine Observation Realm...

Two orifices of the Divine Observation Realm...

...

Nine orifices of the Divine Observation Realm!

If this continued, Ying Bing would touch the threshold of the Inner Scene Realm!

Throughout the exchange, Ying Bing’s aura had continued to climb.

She had shifted from dodging and evading to launching a counterattack.

This was mainly because the skeleton she wore had once belonged to a Master of the Profound Realm. It possessed many divine characteristics and remained pristine despite the passage of thousands of years. Even a Fifth Realm expert from the Outer Scene Realm would find it difficult to damage it, even if they used all their methods.

*Bang—*

The multicolored radiance blocked Han Zhen’s fist, scattering slightly from the impact.

Seizing the opening, Ying Bing’s vermilion lips parted slightly.

"Freeze."

The Yin energy flared intensely. Above the river of blood, a bright moon rose slowly.

Wherever the moonlight reached, everything stagnated. If not for the fact that thoughts could still move, one would have thought time and space had frozen.

Han Zhen’s expression changed drastically.

"Who are you?!"

"Could it be that you, like me..."

Ying Bing ignored his words, focusing all her mind on her sword.

Her jade-white fingers brushed over *Frost*, and the sword light flared. The sharp sword intent made the river of blood tremble.

This sword was the absolute destruction of all things.

This sword would surely hit its target.

The Sword of No-Self.

The target of this sword was Han Zhen’s soul.

"Perish."

The gleaming sword tip grew larger and larger.

Han Zhen no longer had the mind to wonder how she could wield power far exceeding her realm. He only knew that if he did not risk everything now, he would lose the chance to do so forever.

Veins bulged on his body as he gritted his teeth and spat out three words.

"Seize the Heavenly Opportunity!"

Han Zhen’s body seemed to grow younger in a blur.

"Reverse the Heavenly Dao!"

The streaks of white at Han Zhen’s temples vanished.

"Cut the Heavenly Fate!!"

Han Zhen’s aura reached its peak.

He could finally move.

This was one of the few secret techniques he possessed that he could currently use, and it possessed immense power. The price, however, was equally huge. He had mortgaged his future to buy the present.

*Slap—*

Han Zhen clapped his palms together, catching the life-taking sword.

The vital energies of both sides fluctuated violently, almost shattering the void.

*Rumble—*

...

The tremendous commotion finally reached those below.

"What kind of legacy is up there? How can the commotion be so huge?"

"Do you think the legacy is too precious, and Li Mo and Ying Bing are fighting over it?"

"That doesn't seem right. How could the Inner Breath Realm cause such a grand spectacle?"

"I sensed a terrifying sword intent. Is the legacy related to swords?"

"No, that aura... it seems far more solid and majestic than the Outer Scene..."

...

Those below were all confused.

Some bold ones wanted to move closer to watch.

But at that moment.

*Boom—*

The entire secret realm shook.

On the other side.

*Bang—*

The young Han Zhen was sent flying by a hammer strike, crashing like a cannonball and bending a large pillar of the Bronze Divine Hall.

"You..."

"Living for thousands of years, and this is all you've got?"

Li Mo tossed the Star-Shattering Pestle in his hand, a smirk playing on his lips.

Young Han Zhen staggered to his feet, his eyes still bottomless and deep.

"You cannot win."

"You are the disciple of Shang Wu. I can forgive your offense, as long as you abandon the darkness..."

"Have you ever been a girl?"

Li Mo suddenly asked.

Han Zhen’s voice caught.

Li Mo rubbed his chin.

"Reincarnated seven times, surely there was a time you were born as a daughter?"

Han Zhen: "......"

It takes a special kind of brain damage to ask such a question.

"I..."

"Wait, are you actually a girl right now, pretending to be a man?"

"I am a man."

Veins throbbed on Han Zhen’s forehead.

"I don't believe you. Unless you let me inspect you."

"Inspect your ass!"

Han Zhen completely lost his composure, turning into a blood shadow and lunging forward.

"Heh, you think I have time to joke around with you?"

Li Mo rolled up his sleeves and shouted.

"Junior Brother Xiao Bao! Combo move!"

He had been waiting for Junior Brother Xiao Bao. Using the King of Brawlers' move was just a side benefit.

"Here!"

A Dragon-Tiger Golden Pill pierced through the river of blood, flying in from outside the hall and merging into Li Mo’s Dantian.

Instantly, vast wind and thunder, dragons and tigers enveloped him. Li Mo ignited.

He had no choice. The karma on the opponent's body was too heavy. The Karma Fire wished to burn him to ashes.

"Nine Orifices Dragon-Tiger Golden Pill?"

Young Han Zhen’s voice was gloomy.

Ironically, the creation of this Dragon-Tiger Golden Pill owed part of its success to him. Thousands of years later, not only had it gained sentience, but it was now being used by an enemy to deal with him. Fate was truly...

*Boom—*

A hammer fell straight down, expanding rapidly before his chest. This hammer was like a meteor hitting the ground, heavy and oppressive, like a divine mountain crashing into him.

*Pfft—*

Blood spewed out.

Young Han Zhen, who had no physical body and relied on the blood pool for life, felt his internal organs shift from the blow.

"Relax."

"Dizziness is normal."

The hammer fell again.

Han Zhen couldn't even see it coming.

His head was smashed apart.

"You... very good."

Han Zhen’s head emerged from the blood pool again, his eyes cold and chilling.

But before he could finish speaking.

*Bang—*

His head was smashed apart again.

Speaking of realm, he was in the Divine Observation Realm, while Li Mo was in the Inner Breath Realm. But with the加持 of Junior Brother Xiao Bao and the use of the hammer technique, Han Zhen could only be instantly killed.

And so...

"Li Mo!"

*Bang—*

"Good, good, good..."

*Bang—*

"Can you let me finish my sen..."

*Bang—*

It was like playing whack-a-mole.

Young Han Zhen was furious.

He condensed his body in mid-air again, killing intent spreading. The incomplete Bronze Divine Tree behind him danced wildly. This was an incomplete Divine Form, but now it intersected with countless black lines, evolving in the void, helping Han Zhen’s figure grow until he became a giant of blood dozens of meters tall.

"Ant!"

A giant blood palm fell.

"Now I won't have trouble finding you."

Li Mo retracted his smile.

He sensed slightly; Ying Bing was fine on her side. He let out a long breath.

The Dragon-Tiger Qi pushed the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body to the limit.

He swung the hammer again, and a vast Karma Fire surged out.

*Bang—*

The sound shook the heavens.

The palace finally couldn't withstand the vibration and collapsed.

At this moment.

A figure flew in like a meteor, a powerful field sweeping in with it.

Yin Huaxuan.

He had two choices.

One was to help the young Han Zhen, the other was to help the middle-aged Han Zhen.

However, looking at the hammer in Li Mo's hand, his eyes flashed with brilliance! His killing intent was undisguised!

"Capture Ying Bing first!"

Both Han Zhens spoke simultaneously.

"Yes."

Yin Huaxuan’s expression shifted several times, and he joined the battle.

*Roar—*

His body twisted, transforming into a half-human, half-dragon form, swooping down from the sky.

An Inner Scene expert had joined.

The balance of the battle seemed about to tilt.
