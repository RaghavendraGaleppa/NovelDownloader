# Chapter 135: Preparations for War

"Reporting to the Guardian, this subordinate had a minor breakthrough in cultivation and lost track of time. I willingly accept punishment!"

Lin Shan knew he was at fault. Trying to argue with the enforcement team would likely result in immediate arrest. It was better to admit the truth and hope for leniency.

Guardian Yin Wuming stared at him intently. This was a critical moment—after three years of pursuit, they were just one step away from capturing the heavily injured Turtle Sage. Someone neglecting their duties at such a time infuriated him.

However, considering their target was likely hiding in the Shrimp Barbarian Sea and that replacing Lin Shan might destabilize his team, Yin Wuming ultimately prioritized the bigger picture.

"Let this be the last time."

"Thank you, Guardian!"

Relieved that Yin Wuming wouldn't pursue the matter further, Lin Shan stepped back. The joint enforcement team consisted of over a dozen Golden Core cultivators and hundreds of others. If they had decided to punish him for even a minor infraction, he would have had no choice but to accept, potentially losing years' worth of stipends.

With life-and-death authority in their hands, the team prioritized capturing the fugitive above all else—dereliction of duty was a serious crime. Fortunately, though Yin Wuming hailed from the bloodthirsty Blood River Hall, he hadn't lost his rationality. After briefly inquiring about recent activities in the surrounding sea, Lin Shan answered truthfully—though he omitted details about destroying evidence and looting the Turtle Sage and his disciple.

Guardian Yin didn’t expect him to uncover anything significant. With a wave of his hand, one of his subordinates stepped forward with a map, and the Golden Core cultivators began discussing patrol routes and search strategies. Lin Shan tactfully withdrew and resumed his routine patrol.

---

As expected, the demonic sects' search efforts yielded no results. After initial promising leads, the Turtle Sage had vanished without a trace, leaving everyone floundering. Of course, they wouldn’t find him—Lin Shan had already reduced the man to ashes.

Still, unfamiliar with the full extent of high-level cultivators' abilities in this world, Lin Shan remained uneasy. It wasn’t until two more months passed without progress that he finally relaxed.

During this time, he refrained from any suspicious actions, sticking to patrols and cultivation. Under the watchful eyes of Golden Core experts, he dared not act rashly. Meanwhile, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord busied itself strengthening its power in Lin Shan’s cave.

Even if Golden Core cultivators scanned the area with their divine sense, an ordinary-looking skeleton wouldn’t raise eyebrows—demonic cultivators dabbling in necromancy were hardly unusual.

As the one-year deadline for the Black Lotus Sect’s missionary task approached, the joint enforcement team still refused to release Lin Shan, insisting on capturing the Turtle Sage first. Left with no choice, Lin Shan endured the delay. His elixirs had run out, and the Shrimp Barbarian Island’s spirit vein was destroyed, slowing his cultivation to a crawl.

To make use of his time, he crafted Golden Peachwood "Bean Soldiers" and studied basic spells from the Turtle Sage’s collection. These included the common demonic technique "Soul Extraction and Refinement," its derivative "Soul Search," and miscellaneous utility spells like "Light," "Breath Concealment," "Adhesion," and "Levitation."

Filling gaps in his knowledge, he no longer felt the embarrassment of a Foundation Establishment cultivator lacking basic skills.

Another half-year passed with exhaustive searches across nearby seas, yet the Turtle Sage remained elusive. The demonic sects concluded he must have fled to the outer seas—a region dominated by beasts and non-humans, making further pursuit impractical.

Meanwhile, reinforcements from the Lu Kingdom arrived, and preparations for the invasion of the Great Song Dynasty’s heartland were finalized. Guardian Yin Wuming had no choice but to withdraw his team, finally freeing Lin Shan from his duties.

Eager to leave the desolate Shrimp Barbarian Island, Lin Shan returned to the demonic sects’ temporary headquarters at the Volcanic Archipelago with his subordinates.

"You’ve done well."

In a cave halfway up the mountain, Black Lotus Sect Guardian Yan Yuanchun sat cross-legged while her disciple, Luan Chun, massaged her shoulders. The girl had returned half a year prior.

Lin Shan reported his experiences over the past year and a half, omitting details about the Turtle Sage and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord but admitting to killing the Black and Red Fiends and injuring Bear Mountain Ascetic.

Yan Yuanchun showed no reaction to his actions against rogue cultivators or fellow sect members. Bear Mountain Ascetic, as a non-Lu Kingdom native who had joined as an Eastern Sea rogue cultivator, ranked lowest in the sect’s hierarchy.

Lu Kingdom elites looked down on local factions, who in turn disdained Eastern Sea recruits. Moreover, infighting was commonplace in demonic sects—survival of the fittest was the norm, unlike the protective solidarity of righteous sects.

Lin Shan suddenly recalled how, in the Great Song capital Bianliang, Lei Yunzi had shielded him from a royal elder on behalf of his junior brother Lin Fan. Later, when Lin Fan was pursued by Monk Xingtai in the Jiangdong Joy Sect ruins, his senior sister Lei Yuzi came to his aid. When Lei Yuzi was besieged by demonic cultivators at Turtle Catching Island, the Violet Sky Sect even dispatched a Nascent Soul elder to rescue her.

Comparing this to the Black Lotus Sect’s indifference, Lin Shan couldn’t help but think how much better righteous sects treated their disciples.

Yan Yuanchun shifted the topic to the impending war. "The three sects have decided to launch a full-scale assault on the Great Song’s coastal regions within ten days to a month."

"As a Pure Altar Envoy, you’re typically exempt from frontline combat, focusing instead on missionary work. But this war offers doubled contributions—a rare opportunity to distinguish yourself."

"As a rogue cultivator, you know cultivation hinges on resources, companions, techniques, and land. If you want more, you must seize it yourself."

"Whether you join is your decision. Let me know in fifteen days."

With that, she dismissed him. Clearly, she had her own preparations to make. Luan Chun stuck out her tongue teasingly. "All us sisters from Yichuan are going. Don’t chicken out!"

Ignoring her taunt, Lin Shan left. The righteous-demonic war was a once-in-a-millennium upheaval—risky, but brimming with opportunities.

The demonic headquarters buzzed with activity as cultivators rushed between mission halls, exchange halls, and administrative offices. Some returned from assignments; others departed on new tasks.

Lin Shan collected his annual stipend—1,800 spirit stones and a bottle of Foundation Establishment elixirs, "Biluo Pills." Though trivial compared to the 200,000 stones he’d inherited from the Turtle Sage, Foundation Establishment elixirs were invaluable.

After completing his missionary task, he checked the exchange hall’s offerings. With wartime resources pouring in from Lu Kingdom, rare treasures and techniques were now available. However, his contribution points fell short of affording more Biluo Pills, so he left empty-handed.

A thousand li southwest of headquarters lay the renowned Yuyan Market. Dressed in white, Lin Shan browsed shops and stalls, a small skeleton pendant dangling from his belt. Many Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment cultivators—mostly from the demonic sects—flooded the market for last-minute preparations.

"Click, click! So you’re joining the war, eh?" The miniature skeleton spoke, startling nearby rogue cultivators.

Now restored to peak Qi Condensation strength—Lin Shan’s imposed limit—the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had reforged its body. For convenience, it shrank into a pendant to accompany Lin Shan and facilitate communication.

"A once-in-a-millennium clash between two factions? Of course I’m going."

If peaceful cultivation were an option, Lin Shan might have hesitated. But with the Black Lotus Buddha statue’s harvest cycle spanning nineteen years, he couldn’t afford to wait. The sect’s meager stipend—twelve elixirs a year, each lasting ten days—left him idle for eight months. The exchange hall’s elixirs required contribution points he lacked.

The war presented his chance to earn them.

Beyond sect channels, Foundation Establishment elixirs were virtually unobtainable. No matter how wealthy, cultivators couldn’t bypass the major factions’ monopolies—a timeless rule of the cultivation world.

Another reason was the Great Song palace’s treasures—antiques, calligraphy, paintings, and the giant Black Lotus Buddha statue from the Southern Border. These were sources of Ancient Qi. If the palace fell to the demonic sects, he’d miss his chance to claim them.

With his current spirit stones useless for contribution points and sect techniques beyond his reach, Lin Shan turned to the market. Vendors capitalized on the wartime demand, inflating prices, but buyers had little choice.

His goal was to stockpile formation materials. As a refining and formation master, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord could maximize their utility. Though initially reluctant to spend 50,000 stones—a quarter of his wealth—Lin Shan conceded when the demon lord assured him the materials could craft spirit-gathering, illusion, trapping, and offensive formations.

"These formations can affect Foundation Establishment cultivators. Of course they’re expensive!"

Skeptical but desperate, Lin Shan relented. He also purchased a map of Eastern Sea’s beast habitats and miscellaneous materials before attending an auction. Yet nothing caught his eye—his standards had risen with his wealth.

Back in his cave, Lin Shan and the skeleton pored over a sea chart.

"The Yellow Sand Sea has a crab colony led by a Foundation Establishment beast—perfect!"

"No. Crabs only move sideways—180-degree combat range."

"The Glowgrass Sea’s caves house a sea snake."

"Snakes weaken on land."

"The Stormwind Sea has a water bear colony—three Foundation Establishment beasts."

"Too risky."

"Just pick one already!" The skeleton snapped, exasperated by Lin Shan’s indecision.

Lin Shan chuckled. "Fine, the water bears it is."
