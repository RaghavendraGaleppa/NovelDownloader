# Chapter 132: A New Supreme-Grade Dao Seed

Time passed quietly.

The surroundings of Zhang Jing's immortal island returned to tranquility as if nothing had happened. However, the various celestial phenomena during his Dao Foundation establishment and the time it took had become hot topics of discussion among the inner disciples recently. This was the first time they had witnessed the spectacle of establishing a Golden Dao Foundation with their own eyes.

That's right—none of these inner disciples even considered the possibility of an Immortal Foundation. Even the Pavilion Masters hadn't dared entertain such thoughts initially, let alone ordinary disciples.

Among them, only You Yuanming wore a look of confusion. "Would establishing a Golden Dao Foundation truly produce such magnificent phenomena? Could it be because I was in the Myriad Gods Minor Heaven at the time that..." A sense of unease arose instinctively within him, and a faint suspicion began taking shape in his heart.

Inside the jade-green pavilion, Zhang Jing's eyes had regained their calm. It had taken him a full three days to digest and accept the information the Academy Head had shared.

"In three months, a True Immortal will descend to Dragon Lake Dao Academy to escort me to the Upper Realm for cultivation?" A wave of relief washed over Zhang Jing. Without a doubt, this was because he had comprehended the fundamentals of the Primordial Beginning Realm. This confirmed his earlier suspicion—the Myriad Gods Minor Heaven was under constant observation by immortals from the Upper Realm.

Fortunately, he had timely fused the Mind's Eye Dao Seed with the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Dao Seed. Otherwise, there might have been real trouble. Moreover... Zhang Jing's gaze deepened. The fact that the Upper Realm was sending a True Immortal to fetch him so quickly—almost urgently—seemed to corroborate another possibility: perhaps the Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation truly wasn't suitable for cultivation in this crumbling Lower Realm.

"Three months is enough to arrange everything. Since I agreed with the Academy Head to challenge the True Spirit Ranking in one month, I'll use this time to upgrade all my remaining skills into Dao Seeds first. The River of Time Golden Sand should be sufficient." Zhang Jing focused his thoughts. Previously preoccupied with establishing his Dao Foundation, now that he had time, he naturally wouldn't forget about the sixty-five grains of River of Time Golden Sand in his possession.

With a thought, several grains of shimmering golden sand appeared in his palm. Taking a deep breath, the jade talisman materialized before his eyes.

Zhang Jing's gaze swept across all his skills before finally settling on the Ocean-Subduing Dragon Void Seizing True Method—his only top-grade cultivation technique. "What kind of Dao Seed will you ultimately transform into?" A flicker of curiosity crossed his face.

Time flew by. Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

In the cultivation chamber, as the River of Time Golden Sand at his brow gradually dissipated, the jade talisman suddenly appeared in a brilliant flash of light. To Zhang Jing's surprise, it shot straight into his forehead.

Realizing something, Zhang Jing immediately focused his consciousness into his Niwan Palace. There, he saw the overwhelmingly dominant Primordial Beginning Dao Seed had vacated the central position, now occupied by the mysterious jade talisman that had accompanied him through his transmigration. No matter how Zhang Jing tried to command it, the talisman remained motionless—as if it had finally found its home and refused to budge.

With no other choice, Zhang Jing could only let it be. He turned his attention to the talisman, which had undergone a dramatic transformation:

**Dao Seeds:**
[Supreme-Grade Dao Seed: Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud]
[High-Grade Dao Seed: Great Yin Dragon Serpent Devours Qi]
[Mid-Grade Dao Seed: Wish-Fulfilling Treasure River]
[Mid-Grade Dao Seed: Ninefold Origin Spirit Seal]

**Cultivation Methods:**
[Primordial Beginning Realm - Level 1 (1/1,000,000)]
Skill Trait: Dao-Fusion Creation (Immortal)

**Special:**
[Great Yin Dragon Serpent Dao Intent (Perfected)]

Auspicious clouds! Dragon serpents! Flowing rivers! Spirit seals! Various Dao Seeds shimmered with spiritual light around the jade talisman, exuding profound mysteries. Simultaneously, the talisman vibrated slightly, transmitting unfamiliar information directly into Zhang Jing's consciousness. A flash of understanding lit up his eyes.

With a thought, the jade talisman erupted in radiant light that illuminated the entire Niwan Palace. Under this illumination, the Great Yin Dragon Serpent Dao Intent, which had been curled up in a corner, transformed into a streak of dark light and merged directly into the Great Yin Dragon Serpent Devours Qi Dao Seed.

Instantly, the Dao Seed blazed with intense light, covered in intricate Dao patterns and laws, its profound Dao Intent now countless times more concentrated.

[Supreme-Grade Dao Seed: Great Yin Dragon Serpent Devours Qi]
Effect: Dao and intent united, body and mind as one—I am the dragon serpent, the dragon serpent is me. Devour the Great Yin, roam the Great Void.

Witnessing this, Zhang Jing felt a surge of awe. Not only could Dao Seeds fuse with each other, but Dao Intent could also merge into Dao Seeds to elevate their quality. Wait a minute—a sudden realization struck him.

Zhang Jing immediately began manipulating the Dao Seeds, testing whether they could be integrated into his Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation. Before long, his divine sense erupted violently as he forcibly extracted the Dao Seed that had begun merging with the foundation.

A look of pleasant surprise appeared in his eyes—it actually worked! Compared to fixed Dao Intent, upgradable and fusible Dao Seeds were clearly more powerful and held infinite possibilities!

From what he could see now, perfected Dao Intent was roughly equivalent to supreme-grade Dao Seeds. But if he integrated Dao Seeds beyond the supreme grade into his Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation, how extraordinary would they become? Divine abilities, terrifying Dao Domains, even entire worlds—Zhang Jing didn't dare speculate further.

Judging from the Myriad Gods Minor Heaven, the Upper Realm undoubtedly possessed sufficient Dao Intent as cultivation resources. At that time, he might even be able to selectively fuse specific Dao Intent to control the direction of his Dao Seeds' evolution.

At this moment, a new thought emerged in Zhang Jing's mind: Perhaps condensing and fusing Dao Seeds was the jade talisman's true purpose, while features like skill proficiency were merely secondary. What would Dao Seeds become at their ultimate stage? These were questions he could only explore after ascending to the Upper Realm.

"Three months left..."

Half a month later, deep within Dragon Marsh Lake, inside a grand palace before the Flowing Light Immortal Wall, over a dozen inner disciples in purple robes stared intently at the wall, their eyes filled with anticipation. Most were from the Thousand Methods Pavilion, including Yang Bai and Qiu Xiumo.

"Senior Brother You is challenging the Wondrous Dharma Immortal Realm for the second time. He should be able to make significant progress on the True Spirit Ranking this time. He's already ranked 276th—if he advances further..." Qiu Xiumo clicked his tongue in admiration, his face full of envy.
