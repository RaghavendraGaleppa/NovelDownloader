# Chapter 109: A Great Terror in the Capital! A True God in the Netherworld!

Outside the capital.

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official sat cross-legged on a rock.

However, one of his wings had been severed, leaving only half behind, devoid of its golden feathers—now completely bare.

His chest and abdomen bore numerous wounds, blood flowing freely.

His right hand appeared unnaturally pale, starkly different from the rest of his skin tone—clearly a newly attached limb.

"Had I known it would come to this, I shouldn't have submitted that recommendation letter three days ago," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official sighed, glancing at Li Zhengjing, who had just appeared nearby. He said helplessly, "Fortunately, I've defected a few times before, so I know the ropes. Otherwise, I might have been finished this time... Why did you have to provoke the Venerable of Ten Thousand Calamities, the World-Saving Heavenly Lord of the Salvation Golden Ship?"

Li Zhengjing approached, looking puzzled. "He came and went as he pleased, acting with absolute freedom—how did I provoke him?"

As he spoke, he tossed a bag of spirit stones to the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official to replenish his spiritual energy. This bag also served as repayment for the spirit stones borrowed on the Netherworld's stone bridge.

"You've completely disrupted the situation in the capital. The opportunity within the Imperial Jade Seal hasn't fully matured yet, so he failed to advance further and was severely injured..." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official wiped the blood from his lips. "All the helmsmen of the Salvation Golden Ship now know that you ruined their grand plan. They want you dead at all costs... You're about to be hunted!"

The Hanging Wall Bird looked bewildered. "In the pocket realm above the capital, he acted like he was invincible. If he really wanted to kill us, why didn't he do it then?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official sighed. "Do you think he didn't want to? From what I've heard, the Venerable of Ten Thousand Calamities intended to massacre everyone the moment he obtained the Imperial Jade Seal. But at that very instant, something far more terrifying locked onto him! That's why he fled the pocket realm immediately, not daring to linger. Even so, he was grievously wounded while leaving the capital."

"Something more terrifying?" Li Zhengjing mused. "The true Creditor?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official shook his head slightly. "It's unclear whether it was the Creditor, but one thing is certain—it was a power from the Great Zhou Imperial Family, one so formidable that even the Venerable of Ten Thousand Calamities couldn't escape unscathed. You didn't see how he looked when he returned to the ship. I suspect he nearly perished in the capital..."

Li Zhengjing's expression shifted.

The Hanging Wall Bird poked its head out. "The Great Zhou Emperor is dead, the Crown Prince is dead, and the newly chosen heir was even beheaded by our master. With the imperial family reduced to such a state, what earth-shattering means could they possibly have left?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official lowered his voice. "That's what I couldn't figure out either. But there is indeed a great terror in the capital—which is why I didn't dare enter."

He looked at Li Zhengjing and said, "The National Preceptor might know something about this 'great terror,' but since it was left behind by the Founding Emperor, the National Preceptor isn't the true master of it. Whoever controls this 'great terror' must still be a member of the Great Zhou Imperial Family."

"But the Great Zhou Emperor—the supreme ruler—has fallen to such a state, and the Crown Prince is dead. Yet there hasn't been the slightest reaction from within the capital! If it's not the National Preceptor, then which imperial family member controls this 'great terror' you speak of, yet remains indifferent to the chaos in the capital?" Yuan Zhengfeng's voice emerged, questioning.

"That, I don't know. But according to the records of the Salvation Golden Ship, the Creditor who attacked the capital eight hundred years ago was the Second Venerable of Ten Thousand Calamities," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official explained. "Eight hundred years ago, the Second Heavenly Lord perished and passed his position to the current one. Presumably, he also passed down the Creditor's token. That's why the current Venerable of Ten Thousand Calamities has always believed himself to be the inheritor of the Creditor's lineage. It seems he never realized that the Creditor's token in his possession was itself a harvestable opportunity."

He continued, "As for the great terror in the capital, it must have formed after the battle eight hundred years ago—likely a contingency prepared by the Founding Emperor on his deathbed to counter the Creditor. Beyond that..."

Pausing, the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official glanced at the shattered jade pendant hanging from the Five Elements Creation Tree. "After returning to the Salvation Golden Ship, I spent days researching the other fragment of the Netherworld Lord's remains and finally reached a conclusion."

"What conclusion?" Li Zhengjing asked, while Yuan Zhengfeng's aura grew tense.

"Celestial Domain Divine Stones—without the nourishment of faith—will still decay, just like the soul within a human immortal's body. But with faith, the decay of the soul within can be slowed."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official continued, "However, the human immortal's spiritual energy within this jade fragment can slow the decay of the soul even without faith—far surpassing the Celestial Domain Divine Stones in efficacy."

He looked at the jade fragment where Yuan Zhengfeng resided and said gravely, "If you were to receive faith in the future and channel it into this jade fragment, the decay of your soul would be almost negligible. Under such conditions... you would be practically immortal, your soul enduring for millennia without perishing!"

Silence fell over the group.

"If the complete jade fragment is structured the same way as the complete divine stone, it's even possible... that it can cultivate!" the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official declared. "False gods of this world, having lost their original bodies, cannot cultivate. The Celestial Domain Divine Stones are merely their second life, allowing them to cling to existence. They can only replenish their spiritual energy with divine power from faith—never advancing beyond their former selves."

"But if this complete divine jade body can continue cultivating, then the spiritual energy within can grow stronger... A single fragment can contain the spiritual energy of a human immortal. If the body were whole, how vast would its spiritual energy be?"

His tone grew solemn. "In other words, one who possesses a complete divine jade body would have an immortal soul, enduring eternally, with combat power beyond measure. Such a being—how is it any different from a true god?"

"A true god?" Li Zhengjing took the jade fragment where Yuan Zhengfeng resided and fell silent for a long moment before finally saying, "So that means... there truly is a god in the Netherworld."

"Previously, I speculated that the underworld beneath Fengdu Mountain might just be a massive pocket realm, where cultivators harnessed nether energy to cultivate," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said, his voice brimming with excitement. "But now it's almost certain—that is the legendary Netherworld. Even if its nature differs from our understanding... it is a realm of the dead, home to immortal true gods and beings whose power surpasses that of human immortals!"

Yuan Zhengfeng spoke up. "If there are true gods, are there true immortals?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official shook his head slightly. "That, I don't know. The Salvation Golden Ship has no records on that. Even if such records existed, they would have been destroyed. The existence of true immortals would render the Salvation Golden Ship's entire purpose erroneous. The organization would descend into chaos and likely collapse."

He added, "The recent upheavals have not only shaken the Great Zhou Dynasty but also severely wounded many factions. The Salvation Golden Ship has also ambushed and killed numerous core disciples of these factions. My situation is precarious."

"For the major sects, you're one of the Salvation Golden Ship's men," the Hanging Wall Bird said, catching on. "But to the Salvation Golden Ship, you're a traitor."

"So what are your plans now, Senior?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"First, I need to survive. I need you to escort me overseas," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said. "This time, while the Heavenly Lord left the ship and the helmsmen went to ambush the factions' disciples, I infiltrated the Salvation Golden Ship's archives. I learned that the First Venerable of Ten Thousand Calamities went overseas as his lifespan neared its end..."

"So what?" Yuan Zhengfeng asked. "If his lifespan was ending, he's probably dead by now."

"He obtained a complete Celestial Domain Divine Stone body in his early years," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said. "I suspect he isn't dead—just avoiding the Central Plains."

"Avoiding the Central Plains?" Li Zhengjing pondered. "Is he hiding from the Creditor?"

"Hard to say," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official replied. "I've reviewed the First Venerable's life story—from his ascension to human immortal, to discovering the tomb of the Celestial Azure Daoist, to uncovering the ancient legends of the Salvation Golden Ship, and finally conceiving the idea of rallying the world's cultivators to build it... Everything went too smoothly, as if guided or manipulated by an unseen hand shaping his destiny!"

"I don't plan to go overseas yet, but I am heading southeast. I can escort you out to sea along the way," Li Zhengjing said, glancing at the golden page's fortune-telling.

Regarding the "Supreme Unity Sword Art" from the Nine Spirits Immortal Isle overseas, he didn't need to leave the continent—he could obtain it by traveling along the eastern coast.

The Supreme Unity Sword Art had somehow already made its way to the Central Plains!

With that in mind, he left the Hanging Wall Bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree behind, taking only Yuan Zhengfeng's jade fragment as he returned to the capital.

As for the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official, his fear of the unknown terror in the capital was so great that he refused to enter, choosing to wait outside the city instead.

Li Zhengjing returned home to bid farewell to his parents and elder brother, then prepared to leave the capital with the dragon girl in tow.

But as soon as he stepped out of his house, he saw a familiar figure.

The current Grand Elder of the Kunlun Immortal Sect—Elder Xuhua.

One of the five human immortals from the pocket realm.

Li Zhengjing held little goodwill toward this man, as he had once entertained the idea of refining thousands of cultivators into a supreme divine pill.

"I came by at noon but was stopped by the National Preceptor's men. They said you weren't home."

"Mm."

Li Zhengjing felt somewhat satisfied. Despite having consumed a great deal of spirit stones, the National Preceptor had kept his word and protected the Jian'an Marquis's residence.

For a human immortal like Elder Xuhua, the National Preceptor's men had to be extra vigilant. If anything happened to the Li family, Li Zhengjing would undoubtedly hold the National Preceptor accountable!

"The sword energy you wielded in the pocket realm was the Great Yan Void-Sundering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi," Elder Xuhua said calmly. "Don't bother denying it. This is the Kunlun Immortal Sect's signature sword art. For centuries, only the Young Sect Master has mastered it. Having witnessed it firsthand from him, I'm very familiar with its sharpness."

Li Zhengjing remained expressionless and didn't deny it. "It was indeed the Great Yan Void-Sundering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi."

Elder Xuhua fell silent for a moment before saying, "In the pocket realm, you saved my life. For that, I'll turn a blind eye today. But I cannot conceal this matter—I've already reported it to the sect. The Young Sect Master will come to see you personally..."

Li Zhengjing replied indifferently, "I'm leaving the capital."

Elder Xuhua nodded slightly. "The Young Sect Master will find you."

After another pause, he added, "Though I don't know how you learned our sect's signature sword art, the Young Sect Master seems to have some idea. He mentioned that regarding the matter of the Gu King Xin Xuan, you salvaged the Central Plains' dignity. In that sense, he owes you a favor..."

Understanding the implication, Li Zhengjing smirked. "So you're saying that until I meet your Young Sect Master, the Kunlun Immortal Sect won't move against me?"

Elder Xuhua said calmly, "After you meet him, whether the Kunlun Immortal Sect acts against you will depend entirely on how that meeting goes."

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "As I recall, he's only at the Qi Refinement peak, right? Aren't you afraid I might kill him if our conversation goes poorly?"

Elder Xuhua replied coolly, "The tenth helmsman of the Salvation Golden Ship ambushed the Young Sect Master... Having survived that life-and-death trial, he has now broken through to human immortal!"

"Impressive..."

Li Zhengjing's expression grew complicated.

The Young Sect Master of Kunlun had been groomed with the full resources of the sect since birth. In his youth, he mastered the Great Yan Void-Sundering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi, earning the reputation of being invincible below the human immortal realm.

Over the years, despite consuming countless treasures and receiving aid from multiple human immortals, his strength had stagnated—his edge dulled. Now, at last, he had broken through to the transcendent realm in the crucible of life and death!

Yet it was also a pity. Only by dulling his edge could he ascend to human immortal. From now on, the Young Sect Master of Kunlun would never truly master the Great Yan Void-Sundering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi—he could never become a sword immortal.

"I know your abilities are extraordinary, but the Young Sect Master, now a human immortal, has inherited some of our sect's treasures," Elder Xuhua said flatly. "Though newly ascended, his combat prowess already surpasses mine."

With that, Elder Xuhua bowed slightly and departed.

Li Zhengjing watched his retreating figure vanish before waving at the sky.

He knew the National Preceptor was surely observing him through the Hall's All-Seeing Mirror.

"Time to go."

Li Zhengjing left the capital.

At the National Preceptor's residence.

The Great Zhou National Preceptor watched Li Zhengjing's departing figure in the mirror and sighed in relief.

This Li Zhengjing, refusing to serve the court and beyond his control, had been a constant source of unease in the capital.

Especially after he squandered over three hundred mountains' worth of spirit stones, the National Preceptor had slept poorly, visiting the treasury every morning to check on things.

"Finally, he's gone."

The National Preceptor sighed, then turned to issue an order. "Summon the Emperor. Tell him I'm gravely ill and request his visit... Make sure he brings the Imperial Jade Seal!"

A young Daoist acknowledged the command and withdrew.

Closing his eyes, the National Preceptor put away the Hall's All-Seeing Mirror.

"The capital's greatest secret—the foundation of the Great Zhou's unshakable rule—is something the Emperor must know."
