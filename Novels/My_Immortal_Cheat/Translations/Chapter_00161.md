# Chapter 161: Star Realm

"What are you doing?"

Zhou Tian watched Saint Devil manipulating stones in the void, runes occasionally emerging from them. He asked curiously.

"There's a formation of the Heavenly Pass in this void. To avoid triggering it, we need to sneak through."

Saint Devil replied without looking back, arranging the black-gold stones into peculiar positions in the void, with rune chains connecting them.

This formation seemed incredibly profound; beads of sweat dripped from Saint Devil's forehead.

"Sigh, why didn't you step in when we were fighting?"

Since he had nothing to do, Zhou Tian asked Saint Devil. They had fought so fiercely, yet Saint Devil hadn't shown up to help.

"I have a deal to make with a certain leader, so I couldn't intervene. It's already good enough that I didn't help them against you."

Saint Devil seemed to have reached a critical moment. A golden curtain appeared in the void, with colossal runes swirling within it. The small stones were deeply embedded, and the rune chains interlocked, forcibly tearing open a rift.

"Go!"

Saint Devil urged, sweeping Zhou Tian with him as they instantly passed through the rift. The moment they crossed, the stones disintegrated into dust.

"As expected of a formation worthy of being inscribed upon the Heavenly Pass, it's truly terrifying. Even a Dao Lord-tier formation-breaking stone could only barely sustain it for an instant."

Saint Devil sighed, his face pale. He had expended enormous effort to embed the formation-breaking stones just now.

Although the Heavenly Pass's most supreme formations were Heavenly Venerate-tier, such formations consumed massive resources once activated, making it impossible for them to be constantly active. Therefore, generally only Dao Lord-tier formations were enabled, but even those were among the most formidable within the Dao Lord tier.

"Couldn't we just leave through the Heavenly Pass directly? I never said I wouldn't go with you."

Zhou Tian casually remarked.

"Heh heh."

Saint Devil offered no retort, merely a perfunctory chuckle. With a wave of his hand, a brass warship appeared in the void before them. It was ancient and rustic, even mottled, with axe and sword marks still visible, seemingly having endured a great battle.

Zhou Tian awkwardly touched his nose. If they had truly tried to leave through the Heavenly Pass, Zhou Tian would probably have had people suppress Saint Devil and kill him on the spot.

As they boarded the ancient brass ship, a female voice rang out.

"Master."

A woman in colorful robes emerged from the cabin, her features delicate, skin fair, and eyes cast slightly downwards.

Zhou Tian raised an eyebrow. The woman was clearly addressing Saint Devil. "Master? Saint Devil, I didn't expect you to have such a taste."

His tone was teasing. At this point, Saint Devil wouldn't do anything to him anyway.

"She's that Nine-tailed Phoenix-bird."

Saint Devil glanced at Zhou Tian, saying indifferently.

"That Phoenix-bird?"

Zhou Tian gave the woman's belly a strange look.

The woman, however, showed no reaction. Although she appeared youthful, who knew how many years she had lived? How could she be fazed by a mere glance from Zhou Tian?

"Go pick a room. It will take some time for us to reach the border of the Nine Provinces."

Saint Devil said.

Zhou Tian shrugged and followed the woman, who was the Nine-tailed Phoenix-bird in human form, into the ship's cabin.

Saint Devil also entered the cabin, and the brass warship gently trembled, transforming into a streak of light and vanishing into the void.

...

The brass warship sped through space with incredible speed. Days later, they reached their destination.

Zhou Tian and Saint Devil stood on the deck of the brass warship, Zhou Tian gazing at the scene in the void, utterly astonished.

Massive formation patterns flowed before his eyes, each incredibly thick, shimmering with golden light. Within them, every floating rune was as enormous as an ancient divine mountain, blazing like a great sun.

"How do we get through? Rely on your formation-breaking stones?"

Zhou Tian turned his head to ask. At this moment, his resurrection count had long since refreshed, allowing him to use his skills. On the brass warship, he had considered fighting Saint Devil multiple times but had suppressed the urge.

Although Saint Devil was in a special state, one body with two souls, generally weaker than his true realm, he possessed that strange fusion state. Zhou Tian wasn't confident he could kill him within 32 seconds.

His death count for these past few days had also been wasted; he had no opportunity to court death. As for asking Saint Devil for help, he hadn't even considered that idea. After helping him a few times, Saint Devil would probably truly understand him inside out.

"This grand formation is renowned throughout the Star Realm. How could a small item like a world-breaking stone be of any use?"

Saint Devil shook his head.

"Then how about we part ways? You go back to your Gao Village, and I'll return to my Qin King's Manor?"

Zhou Tian suggested.

Saint Devil was already immune to Zhou Tian's occasional baffling remarks and ignored him. He pulled out a golden scroll from the void and gently presented it.

"Amitabha..."

With a Buddhist chant, the scroll automatically unfurled, and a golden, resplendent ethereal figure materialized, seated cross-legged in the void. It was a Buddha.

"Luotian Temple?"

Zhou Tian recalled what Zhou Changsheng had said about Saint Devil having an unclear relationship with Luotian Temple.

The Buddha's figure gently pointed a finger, and the incredibly vast formation in the void rippled. A tiny portal cracked open, and the Buddha's projection vanished. The scroll also disappeared, clearly a single-use item.

Saint Devil led Zhou Tian closer. Only then did Zhou Tian notice a layer of golden light over the portal that had appeared on the formation. However, Saint Devil clearly didn't care and gestured for Zhou Tian to go through.

"Are you sure nothing will happen?"

Zhou Tian asked, pointing at the golden light on the portal.

"It's fine. That's just for verifying cultivation. My scroll only allows passage for those below the Dao Lord realm."

Saint Devil had the woman transformed from the Phoenix-bird go first. She passed through as if through a water curtain and disappeared.

"Alright."

Zhou Tian nodded and stepped inside. He felt nothing special, only a warm, gentle sensation washing over him. When he reappeared, he was somewhere else entirely, seemingly in outer space, as there were brilliant points of light like stars in the distance. Behind him, there was nothing but emptiness, no formation at all.

The Phoenix-bird shielded Zhou Tian, preventing him from being exposed to the void.

"It'll be easier once we're out of the Nine Provinces."

Saint Devil had appeared beside them at some point. He pulled out a purplish-gold card, which shimmered slightly, inscribed with some symbols. Zhou Tian felt strange, as if he had seen something similar before.

Saint Devil lightly flicked the card in his hand. The card trembled slightly, but nothing happened. Zhou Tian was a bit puzzled, wondering what trick this guy was up to now.

Before he could ask, the void before them suddenly fluctuated, and a creature in strange attire appeared. It had a mouth and a nose, but only a vertical eye with concentric patterns in its forehead.

"Heaven-Reaching Company at your service!"

The creature bowed slightly. Although its language was peculiar, Zhou Tian understood its meaning.
