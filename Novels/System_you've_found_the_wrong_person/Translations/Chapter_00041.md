# Chapter 41: The Frivolous Emperor Is Unfit to Rule the World!

The Qingyang Secret Art—Mystic Water of Rebirth!

It could revive the dead and regenerate flesh from bones.

This artificially created secret art was unexpectedly powerful, beyond anyone's anticipation.

Thus, one after another, hidden observers began to emerge.

Masters of extraordinary abilities made their appearances—representatives from the Shogunate, the Chancellor's Office, the imperial clan, Western Qin, Eastern Qi, Southern Chen—all sent their elite forces.

Dou Changsheng felt the weight of countless gazes fixed upon him and sighed inwardly. After today, his name would undoubtedly spread far and wide once more—a reputation he would rather not have.

His growing fame had already surpassed his actual strength, and such disparity was a sure path to disaster. When one's reputation exceeded their capabilities, misfortune was inevitable.

After reciting the Qingyang Secret Art in a low murmur, the old senior patted Dou Changsheng's shoulder and said, "Let's go. The rest has nothing to do with us."

Dou Changsheng glanced at Qingyang Daoist. Despite having revealed the secret art, the man still held immense value. The legacy of the Three Yangs Divine Lord was no trifling matter. Even if the Qingyang Secret Art was genuine, whether Qingyang Daoist had omitted crucial details remained a question. The best course of action would be to take him away and interrogate him thoroughly.

But with so many factions gathered here, who would claim Qingyang Daoist? That was the real issue.

Shaking his head, Dou Changsheng didn't leave immediately. Instead, he addressed Qingyang Daoist, "Since the Qingyang Spring has been opened, and I’ve earned the right, I should be entitled to some of its waters. Could you point me to its location? I’ll only take what’s rightfully mine and leave the rest untouched."

Qingyang Daoist barely spared him a glance, merely gesturing vaguely in a direction. Following the indication, Dou Changsheng expressed his thanks and approached the sealed jade bottles containing the spring water. He picked up one, leaving the rest behind, and said to Wang Tianhe beside him, "Let’s go."

Wang Tianhe flicked his sleeve, and all the remaining bottles vanished. "They get the meat; we’ll settle for the broth. They won’t mind," he remarked calmly before grabbing Dou Changsheng and soaring into the sky.

From above, Dou Changsheng watched the Qingyang Peak shrink beneath them. Simultaneously, a pagoda expanded midair, growing to a towering height of thirty meters, radiating dazzling brilliance like a miniature sun. Each level of the pagoda bore a bronze bell that chimed incessantly, filling the sky with resonant tones.

The battle had begun.

Dou Changsheng observed the clash with awe. The combat between Earth Ranking Grandmasters could alter the very heavens, their every move influencing the natural order. Unable to resist, he asked, "Who will ultimately claim Qingyang Daoist? And what about the stolen military funds?"

Wang Tianhe, letting the night breeze ruffle his robes, chuckled indifferently. "Qingyang Daoist’s fate is death. With so many powerhouses fighting, determining a victor is nearly impossible. But eventually, the Shogunate, the Chancellor’s Office, and the imperial clan will unite—they are, after all, all part of Northern Jin. With home advantage, how could Southern Chen, Western Qin, or Eastern Qi compare? Yet they won’t yield easily either. If they can’t have Qingyang Daoist, they’ll ensure no one else does. The one to strike will likely be Tang Qingyan."

"Despite being only a Pure Yin Grandmaster, she ranks within the top twenty of the Earth Rankings, surpassing even those who’ve condensed Martial Golden Cores—all thanks to her unparalleled speed. Those she targets never survive. The ‘Princess of the Night’ is the darling of darkness. Stay away from her—she’s too complicated. Not only is she linked to the Heavenly Demon Palace, but she’s also deeply connected to the First Pavilion, the world’s most formidable assassin organization. Many suspect she’s one of its Ten Great Assassins, possibly behind the murder of Western Qin’s Marquis Shang. She’s the black sheep of the Jiangdu Tang Clan. Others you can mingle with, but her? Be wary."

Wang Tianhe’s warning was stern, fearing Dou Changsheng might stray down a dangerous path. Dou Changsheng himself recognized Tang Qingyan’s complexity and had no intention of engaging further. Among Earth Ranking Grandmasters, he felt like a lone wolf amidst a pack—utterly outmatched.

Nodding in understanding, Dou Changsheng followed Wang Tianhe’s gaze toward the capital. "The matter of the military funds has dragged on too long. The timing is ripe now. Yu Yun’s prestige has been thoroughly eroded. The northerners no longer trust him, and the Shogunate’s decline is inevitable."

"The Five Valleys Sect and the Heavenly Sword Sect have already broken away from the Shogunate, refusing its commands. Bai Zizai, the ‘Nine Nether Wanderer’ and former thirteenth-ranked Earth Grandmaster, who hadn’t left the Nine Nether Valley in thirty years, has reemerged. He’s now at the Chen Family Fort, forcing the Fire Cloud True Man to retreat without a fight."

"Bai Zizai, with his flawless Golden Core cultivation, has won the hearts of the northerners. He seeks to gather their collective destiny, attempting to transcend mortality and ascend as a Heavenly Being. This was originally Yu Yun’s privilege—the northerners supported him to become their king and champion their interests. With 200,000 elite border troops, the Heavenly Sword Sect, the Five Valleys Sect, and the Shogunate’s assembled experts, Yu Yun’s ascension to kingship was certain. But at the critical moment, he retreated—a misstep that cost him the north’s loyalty and plunged the region into chaos."

Wang Tianhe sneered. "This isn’t over. Yu Yun’s concessions won’t quell the suspicions. Once doubt takes root, it only grows. He’s like my late elder brother—incapable of decisive action when it matters. Worried about the barbarians invading, fearing the court’s abandonment, he sacrificed northern unity. Now, even if a leader emerges to resist the barbarians, it won’t be him. The northerners fear betrayal—that their blood and tears will be in vain."

"Chen Qingyao is the most enigmatic in all this. He had the power to prevent this chaos but chose to watch idly as the Fire Cloud True Man led a ragtag force north. Even I could see the Fire Cloud True Man had already sworn allegiance to the young emperor, acting in the Chancellor’s name only to tarnish its reputation."

Dou Changsheng interjected, "Qingyang Daoist is undoubtedly the young emperor’s man. The flawless theft of the military funds was orchestrated under his direction."

Wang Tianhe scoffed. "When Qingyang Daoist declared the funds were fake, he exposed himself as the emperor’s pawn. The man was bold, playing with fire to escape scrutiny. By causing an uproar, he shifted all attention to you and the emperor, ensuring no one suspected his staged death. Using the emperor as a chess piece—Qingyang Daoist was no ordinary schemer. Had he succeeded, he’d have vanished into the shadows, free as a dragon soaring to the heavens."

"Alas, he fell one move short. I even suspect the idea to steal the military funds was his. The Red Yang likely served as the intermediary, relaying messages between him and the emperor. That’s why the imperial clan sent Liu Baiyu, the ‘Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King,’ to ensure Qingyang Daoist’s demise."

Suddenly, a white bird fluttered to Wang Tianhe’s hand. Removing the attached message, he scanned it before crushing the paper into fragments. After a long silence, he said, "Things just got interesting. Let’s head to the capital—to witness a historic event."

---

The capital, a majestic city, soon came into view. Wang Tianhe led Dou Changsheng through its gates to an imposing estate. In the main hall, a middle-aged scholar in loose robes sat, his golden dragon-like eyes exuding immense pressure.

"Chancellor Chen summoned us. To what do we owe the honor?" Wang Tianhe asked calmly.

Chen Qingyao remained silent, gesturing for patience. Moments later, a tall woman in a black dress, supported by a young girl, entered. "Why summon me if you wish to see Yu Yun?" she rasped.

Chen Qingyao stepped outside, where officials in court robes had gathered. "Prince Wucheng, Prince Yuecheng—are all the imperial princes present?"

A burly man stepped forward. "All are here."

Pointing at the black-clad woman, Chen Qingyao asked, "Tell the Grand Princess why you’ve gathered."

Prince Wucheng declared solemnly, "The stolen military funds have thrown the court and the nation into turmoil. General Yu, for the sake of the country and the north, willingly took the blame to quell unrest. Yet some refuse to relent, inciting further dissent among the northerners."

"Officials seize border troops’ farmland; martial artists slaughter soldiers’ families. The border garrisons are destabilized. The fertile lands of Liang hoard wealth while the emperor squanders it on lavish palaces. Who wouldn’t resent this? The crimes are too numerous to list—all stemming from one man."

"Grand Princess, we ask: Does this empire belong to the Liu clan or to one man?"

The Grand Princess shoved her attendant aside, her cold gaze fixed on Chen Qingyao. "Chen Qingyao!" she spat.

Chen Qingyao remained silent as a towering figure stepped forward. "The north suffers. Starvation claims lives daily, yet the emperor builds palaces, feasts, and revels. The military funds vanish, and righteous men must bleed to restore morale. How can we not resent this?"

"Today, the north speaks through me. Can the Grand Princess bear the wrath of millions?"

The burly man plunged his hand into his chest, tearing out his own heart. "This is the will of the north!"

The Grand Princess trembled. "The Defending Colonel must not die! Save him with elixirs!"

As the unconscious colonel was carried away, she glared at the bloodstains. "Where is Yu Yun? Without his stance, you wouldn’t dare this. Nor would so many gather." Her eyes shifted to Wang Tianhe. "And you?"

Wang Tianhe sighed. "Your Highness deceives yourself. This gathering proves the people’s lost faith. Only utter despair unites them so. The stolen funds were the last straw. General Yu took the blame, yet persecution continues. His loyalty is unmatched, yet his treatment chills all hearts."

The Grand Princess exhaled sharply. "You allowed the emperor’s recklessness, waiting for this moment. You engineered Yu’s downfall to strip him of support. You’ve betrayed the late emperor’s trust."

Chen Qingyao replied solemnly:

"The emperor is frivolous and unfit to rule this world.  
The nation’s affairs may not concern His Majesty,  
But I, entrusted by the late emperor to revive our great Jin,  
Cannot stand idle.  

These fifty provinces and four regions—  
I shall bear their burden alone."
