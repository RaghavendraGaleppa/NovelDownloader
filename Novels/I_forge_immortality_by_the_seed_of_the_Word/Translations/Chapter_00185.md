# Chapter 182: Seeking an Opportunity

Buzz! Buzz!

Just as Zhang Jing was lost in thought, the wisp of true intent from the Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud before him suddenly began to tremble. Then, it burst forth with brilliant light, directly drilling into his glabella, much like the Proud Sun Dharma Seal had done before.

In an instant, a golden great sun appeared in his Sea of Consciousness, suddenly radiating thousands of rays of brilliance. Immediately after, his Sea of Consciousness began to boil. Wisps of misty smoke and ethereal clouds rose from within, gathering on their own beneath the golden great sun, congealing into a golden Auspicious Cloud. As the spiritual light flickered continuously on the golden Auspicious Cloud, Zhang Jing felt his thoughts become suddenly clear and profound. Every moment, it seemed, new insights emerged.

It was extraordinarily divine!

After a long while, Zhang Jing suddenly opened his eyes, a look of understanding flashing in his gaze. "This is a wisp of the Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud's true intent, or perhaps it *is* the Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud? A special auspicious cloud composed of various conscious thoughts, from whose generation and destruction arise myriad insights."

Through this wisp of true intent, he finally gained a glimmer of understanding into the core principles of the Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud. Humans, or rather, sentient beings, generate a vast amount of thoughts with every breath. Greed, anger, delusion, hatred, love, aversion, desire! These are the instincts of life, independent of will. And the Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud gathers these thoughts, whether intentional or unintentional, transforming them into a part of itself, coalescing the formless into form. Every thought, as it arises and fades, is ignited by the golden great sun above, giving birth to raging flames of inspiration.

Zhang Jing's eyes flickered slightly. He looked once more at the golden great sun settled in his Sea of Consciousness. At once, his mind stirred.

Boom—

The Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Dharma Seed suddenly manifested in his Sea of Consciousness. Then, under Zhang Jing's control, it swiftly surged towards the Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud's true intent. Time slowly passed.

Ultimately, the golden great sun that had been nestled in the center of his Sea of Consciousness quietly vanished, replaced by the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud, around which the golden radiance became even more solidified. It looked as if it had already approached a critical point.

Just a little bit more! Zhang Jing felt a sudden surge of joy at the sight.

...

"The final ranking battle will commence in ten days. The specific rules and rewards are as follows." The grand voice of the Secret Realm Spirit suddenly resounded, instantly drawing everyone's gaze. Zhang Jing was no exception. Upon hearing the voice, he quickly withdrew his consciousness from his Sea of Consciousness and looked straight up at the Secret Realm Spirit in the sky. A hint of anticipation unwittingly flashed across his face.

Having traveled from the distant Clear Azure Profound Heaven, how much karmic luck he would ultimately gain, and whether the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Dharma Seed could complete its final transformation into an Immortal Seed—it all depended on this final ranking battle.

In the sky, the Secret Realm Spirit's solemn gaze swept over the crowd below, then slowly began to speak: "This round will last thirty days. Each of you must compete against the other ninety-nine participants, one by one, to determine victory and defeat, and your final ranking will be determined by the number of victories. If there are participants with the same number of victories, their precedence will be determined by their head-to-head results."

"The final karmic luck rewards will be distributed according to ranking!"

"Furthermore—" The Secret Realm Spirit drew out its words, its veiled gaze swiftly sweeping over Zhang Jing, Chang Jin, and Ji Changyu. "The participant who ranks first in this round will receive the complete Innate Divine Ability—Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud!"

"For the next ten days, you may remain in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm or choose to leave. I... look forward to your splendid performances!"

With that, the Secret Realm Spirit gradually faded from the sky. For a moment, everyone present felt a surge of excitement. This was especially true for several beings from the Myriad Heavens Myriad Spirits faction, including the Crimson-Eyed Golden Peng, who eyed it with fervent desire.

That was an Innate Divine Ability! It was an entirely different concept from the divine abilities and dharma methods they learned later, or even those passed down through their bloodlines. Even within the Myriad Heavens Myriad Spirits faction, it was extremely rare. Only beings from races that had given birth to Immortal Deities could awaken Innate Divine Abilities. How could they have imagined that the first-place reward in a Human Race's genius assessment secret realm would be an Innate Divine Ability? And furthermore, it was the most precious type: an Enlightenment-Class divine ability!

However, in the next moment, as if realizing something, everyone instantly calmed down. Before long, gazes filled with envy, jealousy, or curiosity were cast upon Zhang Jing and the other two, who sat quietly on the three topmost platforms. They understood very well that they had no hope of contending with those three for this Innate Divine Ability reward. However, only one could be first... Who would be the ultimate victor? A hint of curiosity suddenly arose in everyone's hearts.

...

"Innate Divine Ability, Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud?" Zhang Jing's eyes immediately flashed with excitement. It seemed that the upgrade of his Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud into an Immortal Seed was very likely to happen this time.

...

On the other side, a rare hint of seriousness appeared on Ji Changyu's face. He hadn't expected the first-place reward for this ranking battle to be an Innate Divine Ability! A faint, ancient voice seemed to echo in his ears: "Yu'er, you have forged the Dao Foundation of All Beings Scorching Plain. You must accumulate to the limit in the Foundation Establishment Realm before you can ignite the primordial flame, thus undergoing a transcendent leap to condense the great divine ability, Human Dao True Flame."

Returning to his senses, Ji Changyu's eyes suddenly revealed a confident smile. "I have already reached the extreme in the Foundation Establishment Realm, meeting the conditions to condense the Human Dao True Flame. I was originally thinking of accumulating a bit more, but now it seems... I should secure the Innate Divine Ability first." He had already made up his mind. His gaze lightly swept over Zhang Jing and Chang Jin in the distance.

Ji Changyu knew that if he wanted to obtain the Innate Divine Ability reward, the only way was to directly defeat Chang Jin and Zhang Jing. And with his current strength, he wasn't entirely confident. Especially Chang Jin from the Lunar Jade Rabbit Clan, who would undoubtedly possess innate divine abilities and unfathomable trump cards.

Therefore— Ji Changyu's gaze sharpened.

In an instant, a faint wisp of fire, as if from the primordial ancient times, quietly ignited in his dark pupils. In but a flash, on an unseen level, that wisp of primordial flame began to spread rapidly throughout Ji Changyu's body. His mana, divine sense, physique, and even the various Dao Intent arts he commanded, all became fuel, burning furiously. A startling transformation was slowly and imperceptibly occurring within him.

...

Infinitely far from the Xuanhuang Realm, within a certain world.

A terrifying giant god figure, tens of billions of feet tall with three heads and six arms, was roaring madly. On its nearly indestructible and unyielding divine body, wisps of dark red demonic flames spread wildly, like bone-deep maggots, relentless and undying. In its painful struggle, the space around the giant god shattered completely, and boundless void storms instantly permeated. Yet, strangely, these void storms passed directly through the dark red demonic flames entwined around the giant god, unable to stir even a single wisp. It was as if the demonic flames on its body did not exist.

Outside that world, two majestic figures sat opposite each other.

"Divine Monarch's Seven Desires Karmic Flame Dao is truly boundless and terrifying. Even an Outer Realm God comparable to a Golden Immortal Dao Monarch, once tainted, can only watch themselves perish." One of the figures spoke in admiration.

"Haha, True Yang, you overpraise me. My Seven Desires Karmic Flame Dao is far from comparable to the path you are about to condense." The Seven Desires Divine Monarch lowered his gaze to the True Yang Realm Master opposite him, speaking very politely. However, there was a clear hint of satisfaction in his words. Although the other party was only a Heavenly Immortal at this moment, he dared not show the slightest contempt. On one hand, this True Yang Realm Master was only half a step away from achieving Immortal Golden Immortal status; they would eventually be peers. And on the other hand, the path the other party was about to condense was extremely terrifying, rumored even to have the potential to become a Dao Lord.

Then, as if realizing something, the Seven Desires Divine Monarch smiled slightly: "I recall a saying circulating among the various Dao Monarchs of your Grand Unity Immeasurable Dao Sect: 'True Yang's开口 (opening his mouth) always signifies a request.' Haha, True Yang, if you have something to say, please speak plainly."

"Since Divine Monarch has put it this way, I won't hide anything then." Yuanming True Monarch's face twitched slightly, then quickly returned to normal as he spoke directly: "I have a disciple in the Divine Monarch's Proud Cloud Secret Realm. This time, I wish to seek an opportunity for this young one from the Divine Monarch."

"True Yang, you wish to—"

"Indeed. Can Divine Monarch open the core region of the Secret Realm for my disciple, allowing him to enter and comprehend the Immortal Proud Sun?"
