# Chapter 53: True Adamant Divine Art

“Master, how many spots does our Azure Waves Sect have for the Dao Sect?” Yang Ji asked.

“Three within a hundred years,” Jian Yuanzi replied.

“Are there any specific requirements?” Yang Ji asked again.

Jian Yuanzi said, “There are no specific requirements; you just need to pass the Dao Sect’s entrance examination. The Dao Sect’s examinations come in various forms, such as completing missions, challenging the Dao Pagoda, battling geniuses from various races, or breaking through formations, and so on.”

Yang Ji asked again, “Are these examinations based on one’s own strength? Can one choose their examination method?”

“They are mostly based on the examinee’s own strength, but passing is very difficult, and you cannot choose freely; the examinations are random.”

“Only by passing the first examination can you join the Dao Sect. Afterwards, you will have ten years of cultivation time, during which you can enjoy cultivation resources corresponding to your strength.”

“After ten years, you will undergo a second examination. If you pass again, you can cultivate in the Dao Sect for another hundred years, and the resources you enjoy will increase accordingly. At the same time, the rewards bestowed upon your original sect will also increase. If you pass the third examination, you can remain in the Dao Sect forever and enjoy boundless resources.”

Jian Yuanzi glanced at Yang Ji, shook his head, and said, “But the examinations are filled with too many uncertainties. As for you, your foundation is still a bit lacking. The cultivation technique you practice is low-level, and your spell is merely a half-stance of Severing Sword Dao comprehended from a sword art illusion. Going to the Dao Sect now, there’s absolutely no chance of passing the examination.”

“I hope you will first accumulate a stronger foundation and only go when you have ample confidence. If you fail, not only will it waste a spot, but you will also permanently lose the qualification to enter the Dao Sect again, which would be too great a loss for you.”

“I was fortunate enough to pass two examinations back then, cultivating in the Dao Sect for a total of one hundred and ten years. During that time, I also obtained four stances of the Returning Repository Sword Art.”

“I cannot decide on the sect’s other divine abilities and spells, but this Returning Repository Sword Art, I can impart all of it to you today.”

Yang Ji hesitated, then looked up and said, “Master, your sword art comes from the Dao Sect. Without the Dao Sect’s permission, can I truly learn it?”

Jian Yuanzi suddenly smiled, “Disciple, you don’t need to worry. The Dao Sect isn’t afraid you’ll learn it; they’re afraid you won’t be able to. The more you understand, the more you’ll realize the Dao Sect’s grand spirit. You’ll slowly come to know this later.”

“Here are four jade slips. They contain the Severing Sword Dao, Wind Sword Dao, Joyful Sword Dao, and Thunder Sword Dao, respectively.”

“Each of these four sword daos, when taken individually, is a divine ability. When the four swords merge, it becomes a great divine ability. As for the Eight Returning Repository Swords, they are a renowned great divine ability of the Dao Sect, extremely powerful. Otherwise, I would not have chosen it back then.”

“Many thanks, Master, for imparting the arts!” Yang Ji bowed deeply and received the jade slips.

Jian Yuanzi glanced at him, then suddenly said, “You have currently reached the threshold of Foundation Establishment and urgently need a profound cultivation technique. Our Azure Waves Sect has twelve high-grade cultivation techniques, five top-grade ones, and one Dao-grade cultivation technique. However, it is incomplete, with only three scrolls. This was also obtained by previous seniors, like myself, from the Dao Sect.”

“Dao-grade cultivation technique?” Yang Ji’s spirits lifted, and he instantly became interested.

Seeing his eager expression, Jian Yuanzi chuckled, “This Dao-grade cultivation technique is called the 《True Adamant Dao Art》.”

“The spiritual energy cultivated by the True Adamant Dao Art is incredibly pure, supremely firm and resolute, heavy as submerged stone, sharp as a flying sword, and inherently keen.”

“It can manifest thick protective *gang* energy on the body surface, and also conjure qi swords to kill enemies from a thousand *li* away, excelling in both offense and defense.”

“Excelling in both offense and defense, and spiritual energy sharp as a flying sword?” Yang Ji’s eyes lit up. “Master, wouldn’t the spiritual energy cultivated by this technique, combined with the Returning Repository Sword Art, be truly marvelous? If I walk the path of a Sword Immortal, wouldn’t a single strike unleash even greater power?”

The more Yang Ji listened, the more he liked it. With such an overbearing cultivation technique at his side, his confidence invisibly increased quite a bit.

Jian Yuanzi, however, said, “Disciple, the five top-grade cultivation techniques can allow you to cultivate to the Soul Transformation realm, but this 《True Adamant Dao Art》 can only support your cultivation up to the Golden Core realm. Subsequent cultivation techniques can only be obtained from within the Dao Sect.”

“If you cultivate this technique and then fail to join the Dao Sect, it will take a lot of time to switch to another technique and re-cultivate, as your spiritual energy will be difficult to convert. You must think this through carefully.”

Jian Yuanzi’s face showed a solemn expression.

“If I don’t even have the confidence to join the Dao Sect, then what’s the point of talking about the path to immortality later on? Anyway, we all die in the end, so why not fight with all my might? Master, I choose the 《True Adamant Dao Art》. I will obtain the subsequent cultivation techniques from the Dao Sect myself,” Yang Ji declared firmly.

Jian Yuanzi was startled. He gazed steadily at him, then suddenly sighed with emotion, “Your choice is exactly the same as Changxiao’s back then. Both of you are full of confidence, without the slightest hesitation.”

“When I made my choice back then, I thought for three days and three nights, but in the end, I still didn’t choose this technique. It seems that compared to you, I still lack the great courage to throw myself into death’s embrace to find life.”

“Hearing your choice, I subtly feel that our Azure Waves Sect might reach new heights because of you and Changxiao.”

“Master, I will definitely not let down your expectations and the sect’s nurturing. The Great Dao beckons for contention; I shall cleave my path forward with the sword in my hand,” Yang Ji said, his expression solemn.

“What a wonderful ‘Great Dao beckons for contention’! It seems I have lost my drive. Since my disciple possesses such courage, then I shall gamble with you.”

A hint of resolute spirit suddenly flowed from between Jian Yuanzi’s brows. “I originally thought of striving for Soul Transformation and ending my life there. But my disciple has awakened me. The path of immortality is long and arduous; one must contend for it, never losing one’s youthful vigor and the initial aspiration for immortality.”

“Once a person sets limits on their own path, they lose the courage to burn their bridges, the heroic spirit of ‘who else but me?’, and the keen drive to advance, ultimately leading to a mediocre life and a quiet end.”

“The keen and sharp demeanor displayed by my disciple is fitting for the path of a Sword Immortal. You will certainly go further than I have.”

Jian Yuanzi said, “Since you have made your choice, I will go and retrieve the cultivation technique for you. However, there are only the first two scrolls; the subsequent scroll requires you to demonstrate extraordinary comprehension and talent.”

“Many thanks, Master, this disciple understands,” Yang Ji bowed.

“Mmm, I’ll be right back!” Jian Yuanzi rose and walked out of the main hall.

In less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, he returned. Besides the cultivation technique, he also brought Yang Ji an identity token, the Azure Waves Sect’s iconic white robes, and cultivation pills.

Jian Yuanzi took out a medicine bottle and said, “These are Monster Core Pills, refined from three-hundred-year-old Companion Demon Grass paired with the inner core of a Demon General-grade monster.”

“There are twenty pills in this bottle, more than enough for now. Just tell me when you run out. However, the grade of the pills can only go this high for now. If you demonstrate strong enough comprehension and talent later on, your treatment will be upgraded.”

“Four-hundred-year-old, or even five to six-hundred-year-old Companion Demon Grass, paired with a Demon Commander-grade demon core, or I can even personally hunt a Demon King for you to refine pills.”

As Jian Yuanzi spoke, he handed over all the items.

Yang Ji bowed and took them.

“Disciple, there are cultivation chambers behind this main hall. You can cultivate with peace of mind there. As for other matters, I will handle them myself,” Jian Yuanzi said.

“Many thanks, Master!” Yang Ji bowed and cupped his hands. The tangible benefits from the sect and his master’s profound care deeply moved him. At this moment, he turned and walked towards the cultivation chamber, for himself, and also for the sect.
