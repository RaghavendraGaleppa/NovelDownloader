# Chapter 236: The Dao Field Opens

Gazing at the being before him, whose depths were unfathomable and origins unclear, Zhang Jing, without thinking, blurted out, "Senior, what exactly are these Nine Luminaries Heavenly Gang Steles you speak of?" A look of utter bewilderment flashed in his eyes, as if he had no idea what the other party was talking about.

Seeing this, the burly man, who claimed to be Grand Witch Xuangang from the Jiuli Realm, chuckled. "Haha, good lad, it's come to this, and you're still playing dumb with me? Isn't Mount Lingshu your Dao field? The thirty-six Nine Luminaries Heavenly Gang Steles were clearly standing perfectly atop the thirty-six divine peaks, serving as the core of the Innate Heavenly Gang Formation. But now, not a single Dao stele remains!" He looked profoundly at Zhang Jing. "If not you, who else could have done it, you little rascal?"

The moment their gazes met, *Boom!*

In Zhang Jing's vision, the man before him suddenly transformed into an infinitely vast world, incredibly grand and boundless. Within it, billions of living beings competed and slaughtered each other, their conquests seemingly endless.

Primitive! Wild! Cruel!

...

After an unknown period, Zhang Jing slowly recovered, his expression still frozen in awe.

"What a terrifying existence!" he couldn't help but exclaim.

The man who called himself a Grand Witch gave him a feeling of terror exactly like when he first met his teacher, Seven Desires Divine Lord.

"So-called Grand Witches, are they beings above Heavenly Immortals?" Zhang Jing instantly understood. In front of such an existence, his meager persistence was meaningless.

However... surrendering the Nine Luminaries Heavenly Gang Dao Steles just like that, he was truly unwilling. After all, this treasure not only concerned his current first Natal Realm but also the future evolution of his other thirty-five Natal Realms. Its importance could not be overstated.

More crucially, Zhang Jing's current location was the Pure Clarity Profound Heaven! As a True Disciple, he represented the Grand Unity Immeasurable Dao Sect. Although the other party might be an existence above a Heavenly Immortal True Monarch, whether they would dare to act against him here was still uncertain.

After a moment of thought, Zhang Jing exhaled a light breath, a resigned expression suddenly appearing on his face. He still didn't dare to gamble; he only had one life. Moreover, with the existence of the Jade Talisman, he would one day reach such a realm. There was no need to take risks now.

***

"A mere Nine Luminaries Heavenly Gang Stele, let it go if I must," Zhang Jing kept comforting himself in his heart.

The next moment, his thoughts returned to reality.

"Grand Witch Senior," Zhang Jing bowed. "The Nine Luminaries Heavenly Gang Dao Steles are indeed in my possession. If Senior desires them, this junior is willing to present them with both hands."

Hearing this, a hint of undetectable surprise flickered across Xuangang's face. He hadn't expected this young man, who moments ago was vehemently denying everything, to have such a sudden change of attitude.

"An interesting young lad," Xuangang thought, a trace of admiration flashing in his eyes. "Not only is his talent exceptional, but he also knows how to assess the situation, how to advance and retreat, and how to humble himself. With such a temperament, if he doesn't fall midway, he will surely have hopes of becoming a Heavenly Immortal. No wonder that fellow Seven Desires took him as a disciple, even knowing he was True Yang's disciple."

Yes, Zhang Jing had caught Xuangang's attention the moment he returned to his Dao field on Mount Lingshu. A mere Golden Core stage cultivator, yet he had karmic ties with both Seven Desires Divine Lord and True Yang Realm Lord. How strange was that? Even an outsider like Xuangang knew that although these two were both humans from the Profound Yellow Realm, they belonged to different lineage powers. How could they both take the same person as a disciple?

However, this young lad seemed to have misunderstood something.

The next moment, Xuangang burst into laughter, "Haha, I wouldn't go so far as to snatch something from a junior like you. Rest assured, I merely wish to borrow the Nine Luminaries Heavenly Gang Steles for a while." He then continued, "And I won't borrow them for nothing. Just state your conditions directly." His voice carried a sense of freedom and ease.

Hearing this, Zhang Jing's eyes lit up. His racing heart gradually calmed down. This esteemed being would naturally not deceive him, so... He suddenly thought of the troublesome matter of refining the demonic saber embryo that had been bothering him earlier. Perhaps asking the other party for help would be a good choice. Zhang Jing pondered. After all, this being was merely borrowing the Nine Luminaries Heavenly Gang Dao Steles; if he were to be overly greedy and demand too much, he feared he might be crushed!

With this thought, Zhang Jing's heart stirred. He instantly activated his Innate Divine Ability, the Grand One Heavenly Gang Pantheon Natal Realm. In an instant, the phantom images of thirty-six layers of Void Worlds subtly appeared, emitting bright immortal light. Following closely, thirty-six Nine Luminaries Heavenly Gang Dao Steles slowly flew out from within, growing larger and larger.

"Senior, these are the thirty-six Nine Luminaries Heavenly Gang Dao Steles you requested. As for this junior's condition... could Senior please help me refine the Innate Bloodgold Essence into a crescent saber artifact embryonic form?" Zhang Jing asked cautiously.

***

On the other side, hearing Zhang Jing's condition, a faint smile flickered in Xuangang's eyes, and he asked with interest, "Innate Bloodgold Essence? Young lad, opportunities for me to grant any condition are rare. Are you sure you only want it used to refine a mere crescent saber artifact?"

"This junior is certain!" Zhang Jing nodded heavily, responding without the slightest hesitation.

Suddenly, Xuangang laughed, "Haha, you've come to the right person today. When that fellow Seven Desires was refining the Grand Supreme Immortal Slaying Demonic Saber, he once wanted to borrow my clan's All Heavens Divine Fiend Spiritual Treasure Dao Scripture for a look. However, hehe~" As he spoke, a smile of inexplicable meaning instantly appeared on Xuangang's large face.

"Hand over your Innate Bloodgold Essence. I'll help you refine it."

"Many thanks, Senior," Zhang Jing said gratefully.

...

...

Time flowed silently, and in a blink, a month had passed.

Inside the main hall of the Dao field's main peak, Zhang Jing suddenly opened his eyes as if sensing something, looking forward. He saw a rift violently torn open in the void by some force, and then thirty-six streaks of immortal light flew out from it, slowly landing before him. They were precisely the thirty-six Nine Luminaries Heavenly Gang Dao Steles that Zhang Jing had lent out earlier.

At the same time, a voice suddenly resonated in Zhang Jing's ear: "Young lad, I'm leaving. If you have time, you can seek me in the Jiuli Realm." However, whether it was an illusion or not, he detected a hint of frustration in that voice.

"Did they fail again?" Zhang Jing's gaze flickered as he recalled Grand Witch Xuangang's earlier introduction. "Using endless worlds as experimental grounds, even expending enormous costs to try in numerous powerful worlds, all to nurture true 108 Fiendish Stars of Heavenly and Earthly Gang. What exactly are those Grand Witches, and even Ancestral Witches, of the Jiuli Realm planning?" he wondered.

However, he also understood in his heart that such matters were far beyond what he, a mere Golden Core stage cultivator, should be concerned with.

But—regardless of the other party's outcome this time, for him, it was definitely a huge gain. As if thinking of something, Zhang Jing couldn't help but reveal a smile.

The next moment, he extended a hand, and with a thought, a crimson immortal light suddenly blazed, then condensed into a blood-colored crescent moon saber. Faint wisps of karma fire were visibly entwined around it, and its extremely refined edge shimmered with a dark glow, as if it could tear through the void.

***

Moreover, Zhang Jing's eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze seemingly piercing through the blood-red blade directly to an incredibly profound Dao Seal within. In a trance, it gave off a terrifying feeling of an boundless sea of karma.

The Innate Karmic Origin Sea Dao Seal!

Unlike other artifacts, this crescent moon demonic saber's aura was perfectly integrated with Zhang Jing; the two seemed to be blood-linked, as easy to control as an extension of his own arm, truly extraordinarily wondrous. In his perception, this demonic saber even seemed to have a life of its own, continuously absorbing the various true meanings and Dao charms within his Grand Supreme Red Karma Immortal Slaying Demonic Saber legacy. It was gradually transforming towards an unknowable state.

"Although, due to my Golden Core stage cultivation, this demonic saber is only of top-grade artifact quality, since it's forged from Innate Bloodgold Essence, in terms of destructive power... it's probably no weaker than the Immortal Binding Lock, an immortal spirit artifact."

"And when combined with the saber intent of the Grand Supreme Red Karma Immortal Slaying Demonic Saber, the power it unleashes will undoubtedly be even more terrifying."

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing nodded with satisfaction.

At present, the only thing restricting him was his cultivation. Once the matter of lecturing on the Dao was concluded, it would be time for him to enter secluded cultivation to raise his cultivation level. He would also need to consider how to proceed on the Dharma Idol stage path and what kind of Dharma Idol he should forge.

"Perhaps I should also consult my esteemed teacher," Zhang Jing mused. After all, given his current situation, the original Grand Beginning Primordial Egg Dao Aspect, which originated from the Grand Beginning Origin Realm's Derivative World path, might no longer be suitable.

But before that, Zhang Jing again remembered the Nine-Orifice Stone Fetus he possessed. "Right, by my calculations, the date for the Dao field's opening is approaching. It's time to prepare in advance." His eyes flashed.

The main hall then fell into silence.

...

...

Another half month passed.

Three Elements City, which had recovered to its former state, was now completely filled with cultivators who had gathered from various distant places, including no small number of Dharma Idol stage existences.

Azure Spirit District.

Li Manor.

Rear Hall Cultivation Chamber.

Mermaid Lamps emitted faint spiritual light, and Spirit-Calming Incense rose in wisps, filling the air.

In the center of the room, Li Jiu sat on a meditation mat, his expression serene.

Suddenly, *knock, knock!* A continuous knocking sound broke the tranquility of the cultivation chamber, followed by a young figure pushing open the door and rushing in anxiously. A voice filled with worry suddenly echoed in the room.

"Father, I heard you were unwell and haven't been on duty at the yamen for half a month—"

***

After clearly seeing the scene in the room, Li Jie's voice abruptly trailed off.

After a long while, he asked, confused, "Father, what is this?"

"Jie'er, it's not that your father doesn't want to go to the yamen for duty, but..." Li Jiu revealed a bitter smile. "But I don't dare. As the date for that esteemed individual's Dao field lecture draws near, how many powerful cultivators have gathered in Three Elements City? You know, don't you?"

"In Azure Spirit District alone, no fewer than ten Dharma Idol stage existences have arrived, and Golden Core stage cultivators are innumerable."

"Who dares to meddle in their disputes?"

"Left with no choice, your father could only claim illness and stay home, simply staying out of sight. Moreover, as your father understands, for the past month, none of the constables and chief constables from other districts have dared to report for duty at the yamen either."

At this, Li Jiu couldn't help but smack his lips. "Tsk, who would have thought, just a few years ago, that a place like our Three Elements City would attract so many high-level cultivators?"

As he spoke, a grand and vast fluctuation gently swept over them. The father and son immediately exchanged glances.

"This fluctuation... has that esteemed one's Dao field opened?" Li Jiu mumbled.

He abruptly turned his head, his gaze burning as he looked at his son, his voice filled with uncontrollable excitement: "Jie'er, hurry and set off for the esteemed one's Dao field, don't delay the hour."
