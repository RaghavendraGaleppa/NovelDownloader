# Chapter 28: Hush Money!

**Innate Pink Eyes?!**

Gu Yuan's heart trembled as he inexplicably recalled those peculiar eyes. It was the owner of those eyes who had saved him in the Demon Star Grotto, allowing him to become a disciple of the Dao Academy and gain his current opportunities.

Wait—wasn't Elder Hu of fox descent? Could it be that Elder Hu possessed the "Alluring Charm" physique?

Gu Yuan pondered the fragmented records in the academy and felt a strange stirring in his heart. He quickly lowered his head and continued reading.

*"This physique possesses a heart of seven apertures and exquisite intelligence. Practicing any transformation technique—be it illusion arts or swordplay—comes effortlessly, allowing one to break through realms with ease."*

*"However, those with this physique harbor desires as vast as the sea. They cannot encounter men without their desires surging uncontrollably, making it difficult to restrain themselves. At regular intervals, they must release these desires, lest their hearts be plagued by inner demons."*

*"Moreover, women with this physique have hearts as unyielding as stone yet resilient as silk. Once they fall in love with someone, they become utterly devoted, binding themselves for life."*

The bluestone book clearly detailed the pros and cons of the "Alluring Charm" physique, leaving Gu Yuan stunned. Could such a constitution truly exist in this world?

Wait—what did "desires as vast as the sea" even mean?

Had Gu Yuan been reading this merely as idle curiosity, he would have remained composed. After all, these so-called unique physiques were distant and unverifiable, hardly worth serious consideration. But the moment he thought of those pink eyes, he couldn't help but project the book's contents onto them, speculating and imagining.

Perhaps because this matter involved a Golden Core Elder, even someone as composed as Gu Yuan found it difficult to suppress his wandering thoughts.

**Swish!**

Just then, Gu Yuan suddenly felt the weight in his hand vanish—the bluestone book had disappeared without warning.

**"Hmm?"**

Instantly on guard, Gu Yuan gathered his spiritual energy, his senses sharpening as he scanned his surroundings warily. But the moment he looked up, he froze.

A figure—ethereal as an immortal, draped in a white dress, and breathtakingly beautiful—had appeared by the lakeside. The heavy bluestone book now hovered beside her. She glanced at it briefly before a terrifying force surged forth, piercing toward Gu Yuan.

The same sensation from the Demon Star Grotto returned—blinding like the sun, sharp as a sword. Gu Yuan's eyes stung with tears, forcing him to shut them tightly, unable to look directly at her. Worse still, an overwhelming pressure bore down on him like a tidal wave, forcing him to his knees.

The might of a Golden Core cultivator was truly terrifying.

A cold voice reached his ears:  
**"Why are you here? And where did you obtain this book?"**  

Gu Yuan could sense the killing intent and frost in those words.

---

The wrath of a Golden Core cultivator was not something that could be diverted by trivial connections. While sect laws could restrain Foundation Establishment cultivators, they held little sway over Golden Core powerhouses.

**"This disciple was fortunate enough to be recommended by an elder and accepted into the sect. After breaking through to the fifth layer of Qi Refinement in the White Heron Island cave abode, I came to this island to feed the silverfish in exchange for spirit stones. This is my second visit."**  

**"As for this book, I stumbled upon it while feeding the silverfish. I beg the elder to judge wisely!"**  

Gu Yuan dared not delay, swiftly answering to clear any suspicion.

Silence—oppressive and suffocating—settled over the scene, causing sweat to pour down Gu Yuan's back. He never imagined that a vague "azure opportunity" would lead him to encounter a Golden Core Elder again.  

Could this truly be his chance to become a disciple of a Golden Core master? Or perhaps... something more intimate?  

But if that were truly possible, would it still be merely an "azure opportunity"?  

**"Buzz!"**  

A sharp gust of energy coalesced into a frigid sword tip, pressing against Gu Yuan's throat and drawing a thin line of blood. A terrifying killing intent surged forth, drenching him in cold sweat.  

Yet, after what felt like an eternity, the icy blade did not advance further.  

**"Enough."**  

**"This matter is merely a coincidence. Blaming you for it would only create a demon in my own heart."**  

**"Since you found this book, you've unwittingly resolved a lingering concern of mine."**  

**"However, you must bury this matter in your heart—never speak of it to anyone, nor entertain any improper thoughts!"**  

The pressure on Gu Yuan suddenly lessened, but the Golden Core Elder's warning rang clearly in his ears.  

**"This disciple swears to remember!"**  

Gu Yuan responded immediately, without hesitation.  

**"Raise your head."**  

The cold voice spoke again.  

Gu Yuan obeyed.  

**"Ssshh!"**  

Before he could react, a silver talisman shot toward him, imprinting a lightning-like mark on his forehead. The mark flickered briefly before vanishing into his skin.  

At the same time, Gu Yuan felt his consciousness shackled by a terrifying force. Even the memories of what he had read about the "Alluring Charm" physique seemed sealed away.  

**"I have placed a mark upon you. Should you dare reveal even a hint of this matter, lightning will strike, reducing your soul to dust."**  

The voice was merciless.  

**"This disciple swears upon the Heavenly Palace to never utter a word!"**  

Gu Yuan raised his right hand, his expression resolute.  

The Heavenly Palace was said to house true immortals who governed the laws of heaven and earth. An oath taken in their name was binding.  

**"Good."**  

The ethereal figure nodded, and the oppressive force dissipated like receding tides.  

**"This matter was never your concern. Since you found this book, it can be considered a stroke of fate—one that has resolved a long-standing matter for me. The mark I placed on you is only because this affair is of great importance. Do not take it to heart."**  

The voice softened slightly.  

**"This disciple would not dare!"**  

Gu Yuan replied hastily.  

**"Since I have taken this opportunity from you, I shall not let you leave empty-handed."**  

**"I have a magical artifact—the Eight Winds Treasure Ring—capable of countering all Qi Refinement-level artifacts. Take it for your protection."**  

Gu Yuan understood—this was hush money.  

Before he could even express his gratitude, a dazzling golden treasure appeared in his hand.  

It was a peculiar artifact composed of eight interlocking golden rings, each engraved with swirling wind patterns—light yet imposing.  

**"We have met twice now, and both times, you have resolved a matter weighing on my mind. It seems fate connects us."**  

**"I sense your spiritual awareness is formidable—no doubt you have encountered great opportunities. Very well. Take this jade token to the Transmission Hall and select two high-grade seals for your protection."**  

After a brief pause, the voice spoke again, and a luminous jade decree materialized in Gu Yuan's hand.  

**"This disciple thanks the elder!"**  

Gu Yuan bowed deeply.  

**"Turbulent times approach. Take care."**  

With those parting words, the "Mirage Cloud Seal" in Gu Yuan's robes glowed faintly, as if invigorated by a gentle force, before settling once more.  

The Golden Core Elder had come to nourish her seal—only to coincidentally encounter Gu Yuan.  

The lakeside returned to silence.  

When Gu Yuan looked up, the figure was gone.  

The vast lake was empty save for the occasional leaping silverfish and himself.  

The sky darkened as the sun dipped below the horizon, ushering in the night.  

Yet Gu Yuan's eyes burned brighter than ever.  

**"So this is what the vague 'azure opportunity' was about?"**  

**"Not a chance to become a disciple, but another kind of fortune? Or perhaps... the first step toward something more?"**  

The possibilities were many, and Gu Yuan couldn't pinpoint the exact meaning behind the hazy azure glow.  

But one thing was certain—his trip to Silverfish Island had been immensely profitable.  

Not only had he obtained a top-tier magical artifact, but also two high-grade seals!  

The opportunities bestowed by a Golden Core Elder were truly bountiful!  

Gu Yuan caressed the treasures in his robes, unable to suppress his joy.  

With these, he could finally match the resources of noble clans—even true disciples—and step into the limelight!  

Yet, after the initial excitement, another thought surfaced.  

**"Desires as vast as the sea... What exactly does that entail?"**  

**"And how does the elder... relieve them?"**
