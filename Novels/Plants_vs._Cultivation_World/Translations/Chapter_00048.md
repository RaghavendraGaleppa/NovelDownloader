# Chapter 48: Sunflower Upgrade Plan

Ten portions of Solar Essence should theoretically provide Gu Mo with cultivation progress equivalent to thirty days of hard training. However, this time he only gained about twenty days' worth—a full third less than expected. This discrepancy naturally caught Gu Mo's attention.

Taking out another portion of Solar Essence to absorb, Gu Mo found that this one provided only two days' worth of cultivation progress. Having already verified that the previous portion was flawless, he concluded that the issue must lie with himself. The most significant change in Gu Mo was his current cultivation stage—he had advanced to the mid-stage of Qi Refining.

In other words, while Solar Essence had previously granted him three days' worth of cultivation progress per portion during the early stage of Qi Refining, its effect had diminished to two days' worth now that he'd reached the mid-stage. 

Two days per portion wasn't unacceptable, but Gu Mo couldn't help but wonder: would the effect drop to just one day when he reached the late stage of Qi Refining? And would the Solar Essence become completely ineffective once he achieved Foundation Establishment?

Gu Mo refused to believe this tremendous opportunity would only last until Foundation Establishment. There had to be a solution.

Suddenly, he recalled the Sunflower's attribute panel:

**Name:** Sunflower  
**Grade:** 1st-tier, Low-grade  
**Effect:** Condenses Solar Essence  
**Planting Conditions:** 1st-tier Spirit Field  

The Sunflower was clearly marked as 1st-tier, Low-grade. Did this mean it could be upgraded, or that higher-grade Sunflowers existed? Since the Sunflower originated from the Black Mist Space, the answer likely lay there.

Pausing his cultivation, Gu Mo entered the Black Mist Space. His gaze first fell upon the vending machine, which now displayed icons for three plants: Sunflower, Peashooter, and Potato Mine—all at 1st-tier, Low-grade. He wondered if higher-grade plants might appear later.

Then, his attention shifted to the door on the other side, leading to another unknown space. It might contain items to upgrade the Sunflower—or nothing at all.

The vending machine and the door represented two paths: one to seek higher-grade Sunflowers, the other to find a method to upgrade them. Both were uncertain, and Gu Mo needed to choose between them. Should he bet on the vending machine offering a higher-grade Sunflower, or on finding an upgrade method beyond the door?

Exploring both simultaneously wasn't feasible. Currently, Gu Mo could only harvest ten portions of Solar Essence per day. Half had to be reserved for cultivation, leaving the rest for expanding the Black Mist Space.

Since Solar Essence still provided two days' worth of mid-stage Qi Refining progress—maintaining a cultivation speed ten times that of a top-grade spiritual root—Gu Mo saw no need to halt his cultivation entirely in pursuit of a higher-grade Sunflower. He could split his resources: half for cultivation, half for exploration.

After some deliberation, Gu Mo decided to explore the space beyond the door. He reasoned that the vending machine would likely offer different plant types rather than higher-grade Sunflowers, whereas the mysterious space might hold new surprises.

With his decision made, Gu Mo allocated half of his daily Solar Essence harvest to cultivation and the other half to exploring the space beyond the door.

A month passed. Today, Yuan Niya appeared once more, now a second-stage Qi Refining cultivator. Her aura was more condensed than that of an ordinary second-stage practitioner. Gu Mo estimated her physical and spiritual power to be roughly double that of her peers—though not triple like his own, since he had begun using the Cleansing Technique to refine his body during the Breathing Phase, while Yuan Niya had only started after reaching Qi Refining.

Still, this didn't mean her combat power was merely double. Techniques, magical tools, and spells all contributed to a cultivator's strength. As an inner disciple, Yuan Niya undoubtedly had access to superior resources, making her several times stronger than an average second-stage Qi Refining cultivator.

"Come here," Yuan Niya beckoned. Having experienced the profound benefits of the perfected Cleansing Technique's body refinement, she found herself increasingly reliant on Gu Mo's services. No cultivator could resist such a method to enhance their foundation.

Though it meant revealing intimate details of her physique, the trade-off was worth it for greater strength. Besides, she had learned some of Gu Mo's secrets too—it wasn't a one-sided exchange.

"Ah!" 

The moment Gu Mo began, Yuan Niya gasped in pain. Having reached the fourth stage of Qi Refining, Gu Mo's Cleansing Technique had grown even more potent. Combined with his deliberate intensification of its effects, the sudden surge caught Yuan Niya completely off guard.

Gu Mo felt that monthly visits were becoming too frequent. Nearby spirit fields were now being tended by outer disciples—those who had recently joined the Spirit Plant Hall. Some with decent comprehension had mastered basic farming spells and leased their own plots.

With more eyes around, even if Yuan Niya had methods to evade detection, the situation was becoming risky. Gu Mo decided to increase the intensity of each session, reducing the need for monthly visits.

"Haah... haah..."

As the Cleansing Technique's effects faded, Yuan Niya panted heavily, staring at Gu Mo in disbelief. Even as a second-stage Qi Refining cultivator, she still couldn't withstand his "first-stage" Cleansing Technique. 

She had wondered if advancing would diminish the technique's effectiveness, potentially requiring more frequent visits. Instead, the opposite had happened—she might need to come less often. This was undoubtedly good news, though the intensified sessions brought greater pain. For the sake of strength, she could endure it.

"You can leave now if there's nothing else."

Ignoring Yuan Niya's probing gaze, Gu Mo offered no explanations and simply shooed her away.

"Hmph!"

With a displeased snort, Yuan Niya obediently departed. When one had no leverage, compliance was the only option.

"The year is almost up. It's time to visit the market." Calculating the time, Gu Mo realized it was nearly time to reunite with his small team.
