# Chapter 33: One Less Among the Dead

Exposing Han Kaishan's despicable face could wait. There was still one place left to visit—the site of Cui Dubu's death, the Cui family's secluded villa. As for Han Kaishan, there was no need to worry about him for now. Given his current physical condition, he wouldn't be going anywhere.

Xiao Ji wiped the smile off his face and listened to the man on the bed spin his wild tale. When the time felt right, he suggested a visit to the Cui family villa. Chang Ping led the group there, leaving two men behind to guard the rear courtyard of the Kaishan Escort Agency.

As they stepped out of the Cui family's main gate, Xiao Ji suddenly halted.

[Among the onlookers at the gate, the man wearing a melon-patterned cotton hat is a spy from the Life-Death Sect, keeping watch on the Kaishan Escort Agency.]

[Thirty zhang to the right, behind the thick branch of a withered tree, hides another member of the Life-Death Sect, also surveilling the Kaishan Escort Agency.]

[Twenty zhang to the left across from the Kaishan Escort Agency, inside a noodle shop by the street, sits a man holding chopsticks in his left hand—another member of the Life-Death Sect.]

Unexpectedly, the Life-Death Sect had set up an ambush. They hadn't been there when they entered, but now there were so many of them. Where had they been earlier? It seemed Han Kaishan had been right—if he hadn't staged this act, the Life-Death Sect would never have let the matter rest. Even so, their reaction was sluggish, like arriving too late to even catch the aftermath.

Feigning ignorance, Xiao Ji followed Constable Chang Ping to the Cui family villa. Along the way, a sudden thought struck him.

"Where did that embroidered koi fortune-turning painting go?"

The core of this tragedy lay in the zither string hidden within that embroidery. He had been careless—he hadn't dug deep enough into Han Kaishan's memories. But turning back now would seem odd. 

"Let's check the Cui family villa first," Xiao Ji muttered, quickening his pace to catch up with Song Yuanbao and the others.

The Cui family villa was also located within Chuyun Town—a two-courtyard residence Cui Dubu had purchased to house his mistresses during his wilder days. After quitting gambling, he had sworn off women as well, leaving the place abandoned. Few in the Cui family even knew of its existence. It wasn't until Cui Dubu's death that the Cui family's matriarch learned of the property. When she discovered its original purpose, she wept bitterly.

Upon arrival, Xiao Ji first surveyed the surrounding environment—only to encounter another unexpected situation.

[The elderly beggar on the street is a member of the Life-Death Sect...]

[The man pushing a cart and selling candied hawthorns is also from the Life-Death Sect...]

"What kind of organization is this Life-Death Sect? Do they have so many people they don't know where to deploy them?" Xiao Ji mused silently. "And they're utterly incompetent. They sent people to steal the item, only to be detected and outmaneuvered. If not for Han Kaishan's greed, that item would already be on its way to Dragon City by now."

"Now they've swarmed the place, but it's too late. Had they been this proactive earlier, they could've just snatched it outright—saving time, effort, and trouble."

After mentally criticizing the Life-Death Sect's ineptitude, Xiao Ji finally stepped inside. For now, he had no interest in learning more about this faction—they didn't seem particularly dangerous.

Cui Dubu's body still lay on the floor of the room, guarded by townsfolk appointed by Chuyun Town. Song Yuanbao and the others entered to inspect it. As expected, it was a sword wound, though it seemed slightly different from those on the escort agency's victims. Yet Wang Dajiu insisted they were identical.

[Cui Dubu was drugged before being killed by the sword.]

This was Wang Dajiu's modus operandi. Such superficial details couldn't satisfy Xiao Ji. He heightened his perception, delving deeper into the corpse's secrets.

The Cui family's ancestors had been beggars. While fleeing a plague, they passed by a graveyard in Chuyun Town, Longxiang County, where they stole offerings meant for the dead. By chance, they stumbled upon a group of tomb raiders fighting among themselves—the last survivor barely clinging to life.

The Cui ancestor, resentful of heaven's injustice that allowed some to live in luxury while others starved, seized the opportunity. Under cover of darkness, he bludgeoned the last tomb raider to death with a rock and made off with the stolen goods. Among the loot was a zither string imbued with mystical power—capable of altering one's fortune and even innate talents. Recognizing its value, the Cui ancestor settled in Chuyun Town, posing as a merchant.

From then on, the Cui family flourished, amassing wealth rapidly and rising from destitution to become one of Chuyun Town's most respected households. But the laws of nature dictate that what rises must fall. Every peak is followed by a descent, and without proper preparation, calamity strikes.

The Cui family had used this heaven-sent treasure solely for material gain, ignorant of its deeper implications. By Cui Dubu's generation, misfortune finally arrived.

An evil faction known as the Life-Death Sect discovered the Cui family's secret. To avoid alerting them, they sent thieves—only to bungle the job. When Cui Dubu grew suspicious, he quietly entrusted the heirloom to Han Kaishan, asking him to deliver it to the abbot of Qingyin Temple in Dragon City for safekeeping. The abbot was a longtime family friend, trustworthy.

Han Kaishan, on good terms with Cui Dubu, agreed, arranging for the item to be transported alongside a shipment of medicinal herbs. What followed connected back to Han Kaishan's side of the story—a far more heinous act of murder and theft, surpassing even the Life-Death Sect's ruthlessness.

Chang Ping and Song Yuanbao were discussing the case.

"We've now visited all three crime scenes. What's your take, Constable Song?" Chang Ping asked deferentially. After all, Song Yuanbao was the rising star of Willow Town's constabulary, having cracked even the most difficult cases—albeit reportedly with outside help. But connections were a form of strength too. He just hoped that "outside help" wasn't the Taoist standing blankly in the courtyard, staring at the sky.

Xiao Ji appeared to be gazing upward, but in truth, he was scrutinizing every corner of the Cui family villa. Inside the main hall where Cui Dubu had been killed, he made a new discovery.

[The blood on the floor belongs to two people—Cui Dubu and the Cui family steward, who was also killed by Wang Dajiu.]

Xiao Ji felt he had stumbled upon something crucial. Among the three crime scenes, the steward's body was missing. If Wang Dajiu had killed the steward in this very room, where was the corpse?

Realizing he hadn't probed deeply enough into coroner Wang Dajiu's memories, Xiao Ji focused on him—since he had come along. Soon, the answer emerged.

[Wang Dajiu, desperate to prolong his life, willingly carried out Han Kaishan's orders. After receiving instructions, he brought the embroidered koi fortune-turning painting to the Cui family villa, killed Cui Dubu and the steward, hid the treasure inside the steward's belly, then transported it through a tunnel to another residence before burying it in the southwest corner of the paupers' graveyard outside town...]

[Deeper perception gained: Cultivation +5]

"So that's it!"

Xiao Ji now understood everything—including the whereabouts of the core item. Han Kaishan had used Wang Dajiu to conceal the treasure inside the steward's body, waiting for an opportunity to retrieve it later. With Wang Dajiu's life expectancy reduced to mere months, his desperation for life-extending pills made him the perfect pawn to smuggle the treasure undetected.

Now, Xiao Ji had two tasks: first, retrieve the zither string from the embroidered koi painting, and second, expose the truth behind this murder to claim the bounty.
