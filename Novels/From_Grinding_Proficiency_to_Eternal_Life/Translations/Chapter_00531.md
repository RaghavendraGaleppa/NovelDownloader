# Chapter 531: In Short, Do Well

The aura permeated the empty hall, making the entire space appear simple yet possessing a grand, lofty, and isolated atmosphere that overlooked all living beings.

This was the core of the True Lord of Clear Source's Dao field: the Clear Source Hall.

Xu Yunfan entered the hall with a solemn expression.

On the purple bamboo meditation cushion, the True Lord of Clear Source sat motionless. Surrounded by the pure qi of an immortal palace, a hazy immortal light rippled around his form.

He still appeared as that unfathomable mid-aged Taoist, his face ordinary. However, his eyes were as deep as the starry cosmos. Just a calm glance from him exerted a pressure as heavy as a mountain upon Xu Yunfan instantly.

The Dao Rhymes diffused around him further accentuated his ethereal and unattainable loftiness.

Xu Yunfan only glanced briefly before immediately lowering his head, his gaze quickly sweeping over the Taoist standing respectfully beside the True Lord of Clear Source.

Half a step to the side of the True Lord of Clear Source stood a tall and straight Taoist.

This Taoist had a slender and upright figure, dressed in an exquisitely made dark blue cloud-patterned Taoist robe. His hair was tied up with a jade hairpin, his face as handsome as jade, and between his brows carried a sense of integrity, peace, and uprightness.

Clouds seemed to flow faintly around him, with inner radiance, his demeanor extraordinary. He was clearly a Great True Person at the peak of Foundation Establishment, with a solid foundation and flawless perfection.

His aura was completely different from Chu Chengnan's, which was as thick and tyrannical as a hundred mountains, walking the path of proving the Dao with pure power. This person's Dao aura was majestic and vast, walking the path of the grand and upright Dao, with perfect laws and principles.

Another Great True Person at the peak of Foundation Establishment.

"The peak of Foundation Establishment. Has the True Lord of Clear Source found another one so quickly?"

Xu Yunfan's heart trembled slightly. He quickly lowered his eyelids to hide the surprise in his eyes.

He respectfully performed the grand salute a disciple would give to a Peak Master of the sect.

"Disciple Xu Yunfan greets the True Lord of Clear Source."

The True Lord of Clear Source's gaze fell on Xu Yunfan, lingering for a moment.

He spoke slowly, his voice indifferent, devoid of any extra emotion.

"Xu Yunfan, it is good that you have returned. Your trip to the Cold Crow Pass was somewhat unexpected to me."

He paused slightly, as if weighing his words, then continued, "Your aptitude is indeed exceptional. Chu Chengnan chose you to witness the ceremony and act as a guard, which shows he has some ability to recognize talent."

Although the words were commendatory, not a trace of warmth could be heard.

Xu Yunfan's face showed no fluctuation, his heart as clear as a mirror. He immediately bowed, his tone humble and sincere.

"This disciple does not dare to accept such praise. It is all due to the True Lord's care and guidance, and Senior Brother Chu's promotion on the spot, that I had the opportunity to broaden my horizons."

The hall fell silent. The starlight was cold, and the silence was so profound one could hear a pin drop.

The silence pressed down on Xu Yunfan's heart, as tangible as ice, carrying a chilling intent that seemed to see through everything.

The True Lord of Clear Source's gaze still held a hint of inscrutable meaning, continuously scrutinizing the spiritual movement of the magic power circulating around Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan felt a chill in his heart, but he didn't try to hide anything.

Cultivation method reform was a fundamental change, impossible to conceal, especially when facing a Golden Core True Lord.

However, he was somewhat confident that the True Lord of Clear Source would not do anything to him.

The *True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra* was a huge pit to begin with. The fact that he had jumped out of it now showed that his mindset was excellent.

The other party's long gaze clearly indicated that he had discovered Xu Yunfan had completely abandoned the *True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra* and switched to cultivating the *Mystical Sky Nine Chen Dark Heaven Indestructible Sutra*.

If the other party truly intended to harm him.

Then Xu Yunfan could only take out the three Golden Core sword intents bestowed by the Pure Yang Ancestor: one sword to pierce illusion, one sword to calamity-destroy, and one sword to have no return.

Simply put, first break the legs to prevent escape, then strike the mouth to prevent begging for mercy, and finally deliver a ruthless blow to pulverize bone and ash.

Very good!

After a long time, the slightly eerie silence was finally broken.

The True Lord of Clear Source's voice remained calm and undisturbed.

"The establishment of the Mystical Sky Peak is your destiny. Cultivate diligently, do not waste your own fortune, and practice well. If you reach the late stage of Foundation Establishment, I shall bestow upon you a great opportunity, perhaps allowing you to step into the peak of Foundation Establishment."

Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed slightly. It seemed he had passed the test.

In that case, there was no need to worry anymore. With the True Lord of Clear Source backing him, if other Foundation Establishment True Persons dared to cause trouble, he could simply beat them back.

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan naturally acted as if he were pleasantly surprised, looking as if he were moved to tears, too excited to control himself. Whether it was true or not, the emotional value had to be given fully.

"Thank you for your favor, True Lord. Yunfan will certainly live up to your expectations."

Wise.

The True Lord nodded, then turned his head slightly, his gaze sweeping over the blue-robed Taoist standing respectfully beside him. "Lu Chuan, matters regarding Xu Yunfan's subsequent cultivation shall be arranged by you."

The blue-robed Taoist named Lu Chuan immediately bowed in acknowledgment. "I shall obey your decree."

The True Lord of Clear Source's gaze fell back on Xu Yunfan. "What Chu Chengnan promised you, the sect will surely fulfill. Go to the Scripture Pavilion on a chosen day to select any two secret techniques you wish. You may withdraw."

"Thank you for your grace, True Lord!"

Xu Yunfan did not hesitate in the slightest, his expression growing even more respectful as he performed a deep bow.

He understood that in the eyes of a True Lord like the True Lord of Clear Source, who has existed for a long time and calculated deeply, two mere secret techniques were nothing but insignificant bait to stabilize a chess piece that still held some value.

Had he not demonstrated a value that could not be easily replaced, and had he not been mindful of his connection with the Pure Yang Ancestor of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, along with Chu Chengnan's "entrustment in a crisis" and the possible hidden allocation of resources, his meager "fortuitous encounter" would have long ago invited covetousness or even a reckoning.

Xu Yunfan and Lu Chuan slowly withdrew from the empty and isolated Clear Source Hall.

The sharp, clear wind outside the hall blew past, taking away some of the cold oppression inside, but it could not disperse the heaviness in Xu Yunfan's heart.

The True Lord of Clear Source watched the two disappear beyond the hall doors, the corners of his mouth curling slightly upward.

"Interesting..."

He truly hadn't expected that the people coming out of the Divine Martial World were all such talents.

Especially that Pure Yang Ancestor. During the three-sect war a thousand years ago, he almost triggered a heavenly calamity and achieved the Dao in the gap, truly stunning the world.

Even now, a thousand years later, he has already broken free from reliance on Dao Fruits, achieving a state where his Heavenly Cave does not fall, forever suspended in a high position.

This means that as long as his Heavenly Cave is not destroyed, he can remain in the world indefinitely.

This is something the Golden Core初期 (early stage) True Lord of Clear Source cannot compare to.

It is also why he exhausts his mind and energy, wanting to have someone else prove the Dao and obtain a Fruit to integrate into his Heavenly Cave, thereby stepping into the mid-stage.

Chu Chengnan failed, so it became Lu Chuan. If Lu Chuan fails...

The True Lord of Clear Source's expression was inscrutable. His gaze passed through layers of obstacles, fixing on Xu Yunfan's back.

Leaving the mountaintop platform and stepping into the winding mountain path amidst the purple bamboo forest, the solemnity on Lu Chuan's face finally eased slightly, revealing a gentle and approachable smile.

"Junior Brother Xu, since we will be serving under the True Lord together in the future, we should get closer."

His smile carried a grand and upright aura, his actions open and aboveboard, making people feel good about him.

However.

As a True Person of the Demon Origin Sect, anyone who actually believed that would truly be an idiot.

Xu Yunfan naturally responded with humility. "Senior Brother Lu is too kind. Junior Brother has a shallow foundation and will need Senior Brother's guidance in the future."

His heart was clear. Lu Chuan was an attendant close to the True Lord; his cultivation and status were not comparable to ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators. Xu Yunfan did not dare to neglect the superficial courtesies in the slightest.

It would be quite uncomfortable if the other were to wear shoes for him.
