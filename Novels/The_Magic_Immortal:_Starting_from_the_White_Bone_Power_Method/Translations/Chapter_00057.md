# Chapter 57: Success

As Guo Zhenshan's voice faded, many in the audience gasped in astonishment.

Wang Chan instinctively touched his storage pouch, his expression resolute.

Generally speaking, mid-grade soul-type magical artifacts were rarer than many high-grade artifacts. After all, materials capable of refining soul-type artifacts were exceedingly scarce in the cultivation world. Similarly, craftsmen skilled in forging soul-type artifacts were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, with very few inheriting such techniques.

Scarcity breeds value—thus, mid-grade soul-type magical artifacts were exceptionally special, their worth far exceeding that of other mid-grade artifacts. Even artifacts like the Water-Avoiding Shuttle couldn't compare, often commanding a premium of one to two times their base value.

That said, no matter how rare it was, this item remained a mid-grade artifact. In the hands of other cultivators, it would at most reach fifty-four layers of artifact restrictions. But if Wang Chan acquired it, he could elevate it to a high-grade soul-type artifact through divine transformation.

If a mid-grade soul-type artifact could rival ordinary high-grade artifacts, then a high-grade soul-type artifact wouldn't be inferior to top-grade artifacts. Especially since this *Mystical Clear Soul Bamboo Bell* was forged from Mystical Clear Soul Bamboo as its base material—its quality was extraordinary, and its artifact restrictions were the matching *Mystical Clear Soul Restrictions*. Aside from its slightly lower grade, it had virtually no flaws.

After all, Mystical Clear Soul Bamboo was quite renowned. It was just a pity that it had been harvested at mid-grade and refined into an artifact. If left to grow, there was a chance it could one day reach the third tier and transform into *Jade Clear Soul Bamboo*.

Jade Clear Soul Bamboo was one of the Ten Great Spiritual Bamboos of the cultivation world. It was no ordinary rare material—it could be called a treasure among treasures. Not only could it nourish the soul and protect the sea of consciousness, but it also had the effect of repairing soul deficiencies. If fused during the condensation of a Yin Spirit, it could not only increase the success rate but, more importantly, enhance the quality of the Yin Spirit.

For example, a Foundation Establishment cultivator who had established a lower-grade Dao Foundation might, upon reaching perfect Foundation Establishment, only manage to condense a lower-grade Yin Spirit even by sheer luck. But if fused with this treasure, there was a high chance of condensing a mid-grade Yin Spirit. With a mid-grade Yin Spirit, the likelihood of later coalescing a Yang Spirit would naturally be higher than with a lower-grade Yin Spirit.

As for third-tier Jade Clear Soul Bamboo, Wang Chan dared not even dream of it now. Without serendipity, one could search every mountain and river without encountering it. But judging from how the Divine Transformation of the Withered Glory Needle had imbued the Black-White Needle with thunderwood power and profound Yin energy, what wondrous changes might occur if this soul bell underwent Divine Transformation?

"Opportunities like this don't come twice..." Wang Chan mused.

While he was lost in thought, the bidding in the auction hall had already begun in earnest.

Starting from three thousand spirit coins, the price quickly soared to ten thousand—and showed no signs of stopping. Recalling how the sixty-ninth bidder had acted earlier—silent until making a stunning move—Wang Chan estimated the soul bell would fetch at least thirty thousand spirit coins. But if the bidding were allowed to escalate gradually to thirty thousand, tempers might flare, and forty thousand might not even be enough to secure it.

With this in mind, Wang Chan took a deep breath and declared loudly, "Thirty thousand!"

While others were raising bids by five hundred or a thousand spirit coins at a time, Wang Chan's leap to thirty thousand immediately silenced many eager bidders. Thirty thousand spirit coins was already the starting price for high-grade artifacts. Though the *Mystical Clear Soul Bamboo Bell* was exceptional, it was still a mid-grade artifact. If it had full artifact restrictions, some might grit their teeth and continue bidding. But it only had one layer of restrictions!

Even if someone won it, they would still need to invest significant time and resources to refine it further. Since its base was Mystical Clear Soul Bamboo and its restrictions were the matching Mystical Clear Soul Restrictions, refining it to perfection would require *Mystical Clear Soul Essence*—another exceedingly rare material that money alone might not secure. Thus, achieving fifty-four layers of restrictions could take ages. Even established Foundation families might need generations of gradual accumulation to fully refine it.

It simply wasn't worth the effort.

"Thirty-one thousand!" After a brief silence, the cultivator in Booth One countered.

Other booths near the front also lit up with bids:

"Thirty-two thousand!"
"Thirty-four thousand!"
"Thirty-five thousand!"

It seemed these bidders weren't ready to concede. Though thirty thousand had exceeded many expectations, it was still within their limits. But Wang Chan was determined—he wouldn't let them drag out the bidding. Without hesitation, he declared:

"Forty thousand!"

Silence fell over the hall.

Many thought this bidder was far too decisive, as if nothing would stop him from claiming his prize. But forty thousand spirit coins could buy a decent high-grade artifact—was this really worth it? Most couldn't understand. This item was primarily for soul protection or nourishment. At a reasonable price, fine. But at this cost, one might as well buy soul-type talismans as a backup. Even if mid-grade soul-type talismans were rare, with forty thousand spirit coins, spending just thirty percent could secure a stack of them with some effort. There was no need for such extravagance.

"Fellow Daoist, your boldness is admirable!" The cultivator in Booth One conceded with a laugh. The others also withdrew.

There were still three final treasures in this auction. Though the *Mystical Clear Soul Bamboo Bell* was rare, it wasn't worth exhausting their resources over.

"Congratulations to Fellow Daoist of Booth Ninety-Six for winning this item." Guo Zhenshan struck the gavel, then glanced between Wang Chan's booth and Booth Sixty-Nine, grinning. There was a method to how auction tokens were distributed—the first thirty-six were reserved for those of notable backgrounds. Yet, the first two key items had gone to lower-numbered bidders. Interesting.

Of course, this was also because of his earlier warning, which had emboldened bidders to act without fear. Judging by the results, this auction was going well. Soon, he could confidently hand over the sect's pig-rearing duties to his junior disciples. Ah, from now on, the burden of managing the nine auction halls of White Mountain would rest solely on his shoulders.

Shortly after, a green-robed female cultivator approached Wang Chan's booth, carrying a jade case. She wore a green veil and was at the late Qi Refining stage. Only when she entered through the formation's light barrier with her access token did Wang Chan notice the identity plaque at her waist—not silver, but green, with matching cloud patterns. Likely an outer disciple of the Misty Cloud Sect.

"Greetings, Fellow Daoist. This is the *Mystical Clear Soul Bamboo Bell*. You may inspect it." The woman placed the jade case on the table, then paused upon noticing Wang Chan was only at the early Qi Refining stage. She bowed slightly. "This artifact has no hidden flaws or lingering issues. You may refine it with confidence."

Wang Chan channeled his spiritual energy, sending a spell into the bell. The artifact floated up, spun lightly, then settled into his palm. Instantly, a cooling sensation spread through his body, seeping into his sea of consciousness and true bones—soothing and calming. The artifact's condition was flawless, its restriction patterns clear and orderly, like rippling water, faint yet vibrant.

**[Mid-grade artifact *Mystical Clear Soul Bamboo Bell* detected. Record?]**

A prompt appeared. Wang Chan glanced at it, then withdrew his focus, returning the bell to the jade case. He patted his storage pouch, and with a shimmer of light, forty thousand spirit coins materialized in neat stacks on the floor.

"The count is correct." The woman's eyes brightened as she verified the sum with her spiritual sense. Smiling, she produced a spare storage pouch from her sleeve and swept the coins into it with a wave.

Wang Chan, meanwhile, tucked the bell into his sleeve, leaving the jade case untouched. Then, with a thought, he chose to record the artifact.

The artifact section of his interface updated:

**[Artifacts (2/3): Withered Glory Needle (low-grade, restrictions: 21/21, Divinely Transformed), Mystical Clear Soul Bamboo Bell (mid-grade, restrictions: 1/54)]**

Simultaneously, the bell in his sleeve silently appeared in his sea of consciousness. Hovering above his soul avatar, it expanded into a vast, hazy green shadow that enveloped his entire sea of consciousness. A translucent glow shimmered with countless restriction patterns, pushing aside the Soul-Calming Talisman that had previously guarded his soul.

*Ding.*

A soft chime echoed, sending ripples through his sea of consciousness. His soul basked in refreshing coolness, his mind clearer than ever. Wang Chan nearly moaned in pleasure but restrained himself to a faint smile.

Now, with offense, defense, mobility, and soul protection all covered, his survival capabilities had reached new heights. With this bell guarding his sea of consciousness, he no longer needed to fear demonic backlash or inner demons. His cultivation path was now unobstructed.

Moreover, with over ten thousand spirit coins left, he could sustain years of accelerated cultivation using spirit bones and medicinal baths. At four strands of spiritual energy per year, he could reach mid Qi Refining in about five years—or three to four if he supplemented with pills.

"Fellow Daoist," the green-robed woman asked as she finished collecting the coins, "do you wish to continue bidding or leave now? If the latter, I can escort you out safely."
