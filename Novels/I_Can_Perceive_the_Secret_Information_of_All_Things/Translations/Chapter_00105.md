This demeanor puzzled the demons, who had initially thought they had found easy prey. Uncertain of the man's true strength, they hesitated to attack.  

When the three beasts finally concluded that this man was nothing more than an ordinary human, they bared their fangs and lunged—  

Only to crumble into ashes mid-leap.
