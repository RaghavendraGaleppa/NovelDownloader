# Chapter 109: King of Gods

Zhang Yi was speechless. How could this person be so hurtful with his words?

"Since we can't contact our people, how are you going to find them?" Zhou Tian didn't pay attention to Zhang Yi's expressive reactions. It was just the truth; was he not allowed to say it? He turned and asked.

"It's simple. Just head towards the center of the God-forsaken Land. This is Myriad Gods Mountain, the most concentrated area for the remnant forces of the God Realm. People from the Nine Provinces rarely come to this easternmost part of the God-forsaken Land." Zhang Yi said as a matter of course, "As long as you head towards the center of the God-forsaken Land, you'll naturally encounter people from the Nine Provinces."

"Myriad Gods Mountain? You mean that big mountain?" Zhou Tian asked, pointing at the majestic divine mountain behind him.

"That's right, that's Myriad Gods Mountain. It's where the ancient gods of the God Realm gathered, once a pillar supporting the heavens of the God Realm. It's said that there's a Myriad Gods Hall on it, where the King of Gods summoned all the gods." Zhang Yi nodded, sighed, and continued, "Unfortunately, after the ancient war, Myriad Gods Mountain was shattered, and the Myriad Gods Hall is also nowhere to be found."

"What the hell is 'King of Gods'? That title is a bit too much." Zhou Tian complained.

"The King of Gods is the King of Gods," Zhang Yi glanced at Zhou Tian and explained, "The god who bore the heavenly mandate of the ancient God Realm was the King of Gods. The heavenly mandates of the ancient realms were not like those of the current provinces; they were extremely powerful. The Buddha Lord of the Buddhist Realm, the Dao Lord of the Dao Realm, the Heavenly Lord of my Futian Realm, etc., were all extremely powerful, rulers of their respective realms, capable of commanding an entire realm. The King of Gods was no different."

"The reason those remnant gods of the God Realm are returning is probably also inextricably linked to the emergence of the God-forsaken Land's heavenly mandate," Zhang Yi concluded.

"How do you know so much?" Zhou Tian eyed Zhang Yi up and down.

"Most of it was told to me by my master, and part of it I found out myself."

"Oh." Zhou Tian nodded, then, as if something occurred to him, he asked, "Then do you know why they don't seem to be able to use spiritual sense?"

Zhang Yi looked at Zhou Tian confused, not knowing why he asked this, but still answered, "The source of the gods' power in the God Realm is faith, and faith seems to appear out of thin air, as if this energy is generated simply by people revering you in their hearts. This is very illogical. The Nine Provinces once researched this, and concluded that faith, this energy, originates from the human soul; it's a pure energy within the soul. Therefore, these believers are actually people with incomplete souls, and naturally cannot cultivate their divine souls or use spiritual sense."

Zhou Tian nodded in realization, "So that's how it is. Professional insights really do clarify things."

"Alright, I have no more questions. You can go now." Zhou Tian waved his hand.

Zhang Yi's eyes widened. This was like "discarding the donkey after it grinds the mill," but it was true that he should leave.

"Alright, I won't chatter with you anymore. Protect yourself, and act within your capabilities. I speculate that due to the return of the gods, the days ahead here might be very unsettled. People from the Nine Provinces might also be tied down. Be careful in everything." Zhang Yi exhorted.

"Got it. Why are you so nagging, like an old woman? Report my safety to Tian Ling and tell her her husband is fine." Zhou Tian replied.

Zhang Yi nodded, said no more, cupped his hands to Mu Su, turned, and left without a moment's hesitation. He took one step and reappeared several meters away, soon disappearing from Zhou Tian's sight.

"Zhou Tian, what were you two just talking about?" Mu Su looked intently at Zhou Tian. He had heard every word of their conversation, and what they discussed had opened up a whole new world for him. Mu Su had been rescued along with Zhang Yi, and what they had just talked about wasn't a big secret, so Zhang Yi hadn't avoided him.

"Don't worry about it, we were just bullshitting. Don't take it to heart." Zhou Tian said nonchalantly.

"..." Mu Su was choked. You've left me speechless.

"Where are you going next?" Zhou Tian then asked.

"Next?" Mu Su looked confused. He was now a traitor to the Sacred God Cult, a wanted man. Where could he go?

"I want to go home and see." A moment later, Mu Su said in a low voice. He didn't know what would happen to his parents after the news of his collaboration with evil god cultists reached home. Thinking of this, Mu Su glanced at Zhou Tian. Could all of this be blamed on Zhou Tian? Mu Su knew in his heart that this couldn't entirely be blamed on Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian had never forced him to do anything; everything was his own choice. His heart was already restless; Zhou Tian was merely a catalyst.

"Go home? That's fine. But wait for me a moment." Mu Su nodded, not in a hurry at this moment. Zhou Tian turned to look at the continuous mountain range, where trees were thick and tall, and earth-shattering roars occasionally echoed. He vanished from his spot in a flash. A moment later, Mu Su only heard a roar from the mountains, the ground shaking continuously. Thick, yellowish-brown stone pillars rose out of thin air, each nearly a hundred zhang high, covered in sharp barbs. A massive figure soared into the air, stepping on the stone pillars. It was shaped like an ox, with a snake-like tail and wings on its ribs. Its entire body was reddish-yellow, its scales shining brightly, and its beast eyes were blood-red. There was a charred mark on its rump, from which roars emanated, the sound waves almost breaking the nearby trees. A moment later, as if it found something, it ascended into the air and flew in one direction. Mu Su's expression was strange; that direction seemed to be where the Ash Cultists were located. After a while, Zhou Tian's figure appeared, emerging from the forest.

Mu Su asked with a strange expression, "Why are there so many holes in your clothes?"

"Nothing, just fell down. Let's go." Zhou Tian answered evasively, secretly complaining, *'They won't even let me cure your hemorrhoids, you deserve to be in pain!*' He then recalled the scene of countless yellowish-brown barbs piercing through various parts of his body, *'It really hurts, was it easy for me?'*

Meanwhile, Anduin looked at the giant beast shadow flying towards him with a shocked and angry expression, "Which idiot provoked Gaosh!" The position became chaotic, flames soared, the earth shook non-stop, runes filled the sky, and divine spells flashed continuously.

Mu Su silently shifted his feet, moving a little further away from Zhou Tian.

Mu Su's home was still some distance away, a small town. There were many such small towns near Sai Le City, falling within the Sacred God Cult's jurisdiction. Along the way, Zhou Tian learned a lot about Mu Su's past: his father was the town's bishop, holding a high position and a devout believer of the Sacred God Lord. He also had a female friend he grew up with, who was also a devout believer of the Sacred God Cult, and so on.
