# Chapter 16: Night Exploration of Xu Family Fortress  

Yin Ranyue mustered her courage to open the door and stepped out of her room, glancing around. The only movement was the rustling leaves of the pomelo tree in the courtyard, swaying gently in the wind, casting flickering shadows. There was no other sign of anything unusual.  

Sighing softly, Yin Ranyue gazed at the tightly shut door of the east wing before turning back to her room, lying down fully clothed.  

This time, however, sleep eluded her even more. Her mind was filled with images of Qin Ziling—his gentle and considerate demeanor, his handsome face adorned with sincere smiles over the past few days.  

As she dwelled on these thoughts, tears silently rolled down from the corners of her eyes.  

Before, serving Qin Ziling had merely felt like her duty, something taken for granted, a monotonous routine repeated day after day without stirring any unusual emotions. But ever since Qin Ziling had changed, a strange new feeling had quietly taken root in her heart.  

Even when he went to the martial arts school in the city, she would often think of him. Especially today, when he had stood up for her, declaring that she wasn't a mere object but family—that moment had filled her with an unprecedented sense of being cherished and protected.  

Yet, fate was not something a weak woman like her could resist, nor could an ordinary man like Qin Ziling defy it.  

Thus, to protect the Qin family, Yin Ranyue had resolutely chosen to submit. Had there been any other choice, she would have preferred death over allowing Xu Yuanbiao to defile her body.  

"Young Master..." she whispered into the darkness before suddenly rising and reopening the door.  

Standing at the threshold, she first peeked toward the main house like a thief, ensuring no movement, before fixing her gaze on the closed door of the east wing. Under the moonlight, a faint blush crept onto her delicate cheeks as she hesitated—her foot lifting to step forward, then retreating.  

After several such hesitations, she took a deep breath and resolutely crossed the courtyard to the east wing, knocking lightly on the door.  

"Young Master, it's me, Ranyue," she called softly.  

But Qin Ziling seemed to be in deep slumber. No matter how long she knocked, there was no response from within.  

The blush on her face gradually faded, replaced by sorrow and desolation.  

"Young Master, I know I can't give you my first time—that would bring disaster upon the Qin family. I just wanted you to be the first man to see my pure body," she murmured tearfully before shaking her head and turning away, heartbroken, to return to her room.  

By the time Yin Ranyue retreated to the west wing, Qin Ziling—dressed in black martial attire—had already slipped out of Anhe Village under the cover of night, swiftly making his way toward the Xu Family Fortress.  

---  

Under the dark sky, the Xu Family Fortress loomed like a colossal beast crouched upon the earth.  

The fortress was built upon a massive earthen platform—half natural, half artificially constructed—rising twenty feet high. Its walls stood ten meters tall, stretching three to four li in circumference, encircled by a moat.  

The moat, widened and deepened from a natural river, was broad and deep, with high embankments. Even during droughts, crossing it without a bridge would be nearly impossible.  

Once the drawbridge was raised, the fortress became an impregnable stronghold.  

Moreover, outside the fortress, several watchtowers stood guard at each cardinal direction. These towering structures, reinforced with brick and stone, loomed like fierce beasts, instilling unease in anyone who approached.  

Surrounding the fortress were vast stretches of fertile farmland, crisscrossed with well-maintained irrigation channels.  

Qin Ziling concealed his physical body in a hidden spot on a small hill about two li from the fortress. Summoning the Bronze Corpse of the Arm-Swinging Ape, he commanded it with his divine sense to guard his body before sitting cross-legged to perform the Soul Departure technique.  

The Bronze Corpse, marked with his blood seal, would instinctively protect his body even without direct orders—though it would act mechanically without his guidance.  

Once his soul left his body, it carried the poisoned embroidery needle as it floated toward the Xu Family Fortress.  

Qin Ziling had only ever observed the fortress from afar, never venturing close—let alone inside.  

Tonight, as his soul silently drifted to the fortress walls, gazing up at the towering watchtowers and the sturdy battlements manned by armored soldiers wielding blades and halberds, he finally understood why the authorities were reluctant to provoke the Xu Family.  

Though the sentries on the walls couldn’t see him, he still avoided them carefully, wary of those with innate "yin-yang eyes" who might detect his presence.  

Even at night, the fortress bustled with activity. The orderly streets and rows of tiled houses hinted at the liveliness of daytime commerce.  

The western section radiated an intense aura of martial vigor, visible to Qin Ziling’s soul as a faint red glow.  

"Such concentrated martial energy, along with the training grounds and command platform—this must be the military quarter," he mused before shifting his focus to the southern district.  

The southern area differed markedly from the rest of the fortress, featuring over a hundred multi-courtyard residences with ornate gates. Among them, several grand mansions stood out, their vermilion doors studded with gleaming brass nails and rings, flanked by stone-carved qilin statues. Their high walls enclosed estates spanning at least ten mu each.  

Moreover, though the martial aura here wasn’t as dense as in the military quarter, a few particularly powerful sources stood out like torches in the night.  

"This must be where the Xu clan’s main family and key figures reside. Xu Yuanbiao, though a bastard son, is still the fort lord’s offspring—he should be here."  

With that thought, Qin Ziling’s soul, still carrying the needle, drifted toward the southern district.  

Uncertain of Xu Yuanbiao’s exact location, he first hid the needle in a tree before slipping through walls and alleys to search room by room.  

"Hmm?"  

As he passed one mansion, he noticed a tall man walking past an artificial pond toward a two-story pavilion in the rear courtyard. The man’s build closely resembled that of the figure he had seen riding a cloud-leopard steed the previous night.  

Whether it was the same person, Qin Ziling couldn’t be sure—he had been too far away then to see clearly.  

Tonight, however, he could make out the man’s features: a long, horse-like face, deep-set eyes, prominent brow ridges, and a towering frame that exuded stern authority.  

But more striking than his appearance was the overwhelming martial aura radiating from him. Even from over ten meters away, Qin Ziling’s soul felt waves of oppressive heat.  

"No wonder souls at the Possession stage can only inhabit ordinary people. If this man’s aura burns from such a distance, attempting possession would be like throwing oneself into fire! And powerful martial artists usually have strong souls and unshakable wills—even if possession succeeded, controlling them would be impossible."  

As Qin Ziling watched the man’s retreating figure in awe, the man suddenly turned, as if sensing something. Startled, Qin Ziling swiftly darted behind a nearby rockery.
