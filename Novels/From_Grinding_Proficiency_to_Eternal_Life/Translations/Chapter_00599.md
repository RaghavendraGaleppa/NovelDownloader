# Chapter 599: The Rage-Slaying Sword Intent

The reaction showed the emotional value was right in place.

Regardless of what the other party might be thinking, how could one speak of loyalty from someone who doesn't even bother with superficial niceties?

He paused slightly, his gaze seeming to pierce through Xu Yunfan and look into the endless void. His voice suddenly became indifferent but carried a hint of scrutiny.

"However, you and the Pure Yang True Lord of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect are from the same lineage of the Divine Martial World's Dao Sect."

His tone held no intention of reproach; he merely said faintly, "My Primordial Origin Sect is vast and inclusive, teaching all kinds without discrimination. It is quite common for the disciples under my command to have their own fortuitous encounters and have some connections with other sects. Given the status of the Pure Yang True Lord, having a bond as fellow disciples with you is also your good fortune. It's just that..."

His tone shifted slightly as his gaze fell on Xu Yunfan's face, "When it comes to matters of sect secrets or key duties, this relationship will ultimately make me have an unnecessary concern when considering candidates."

Xu Yunfan's heart chilled inwardly. He knew the True Lord had indeed pointed out this layer of relationship.

He immediately straightened his back, his expression turning extremely solemn as he looked straight ahead into the void. He declared firmly and loudly, "Disciple Xu Yunfan, born of humble origins. I was fortunate enough to be taken in by the True Lord into the Primordial Origin Sect, which is why I am where I am today."

"The Sect has bestowed upon me Dao arts and opportunities, protecting the completeness of my Dao path. This kindness and virtue, this disciple feels deeply in his heart and would never dare to forget it for a moment!"

"As long as I live, I am a person of the Primordial Origin Sect; if I die, I am a ghost of the Primordial Origin Sect!"

"This body, this heart, this Dao path—all were bestowed by the Primordial Origin Sect!"

"This disciple, although having a connection from the same world and same sect with the Pure Yang Ancestor, the Ancestor is a Supreme Lord of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, his status as noble as the heavens. I am merely a Foundation Establishment junior of the sect; how could I dare to overstep my bounds?"

"Nor would I dare to let private matters hinder public affairs. In this disciple's heart, there is only the law of the sect, only the commands of the True Lord. I have no other thoughts."

"This heart is clear and bright; heaven and earth can bear witness!"

"No matter when, no matter where, no matter who I face, it is just one sentence: This disciple's loyalty to the sect and to the True Lord is absolute!"

Xu Yunfan's voice was sonorous and powerful, echoing in the empty stone hall, permeated with an undeniable determination.

Xu Yunfan naturally gave his表态 (statement), saying solemnly, "True Lord, please see clearly! As long as I live, I am a person of the Primordial Origin Sect; if I die, I am a ghost of the Primordial Origin Sect!"

No matter what, it was just one sentence.

Loyalty!

He was well-versed in the essentials of surviving within a behemoth of a demonic sect like the Primordial Origin Sect. The posture of pledging loyalty must be fully displayed, and it must appear decisive and unambiguous, with a stance so clear it borders on fanaticism.

Only then could he swim like a fish in water.

What if the other party asks you to execute a mission from which there is absolutely no return?

Then I'm sorry, but actually, I can also love the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect. After all, my Ancestor is the Pure Yang Ancestor.

The Clear Source True Lord was very satisfied with Xu Yunfan's statement.

On that impassive face, the corners of his mouth finally curled up into an imperceptible arc.

This statement was crisp and decisive, weighty and impactful. It expressed his stance, attitude, and value to the fullest.

The emotional value was given in full measure!

He nodded slightly, his tone much gentler. "Good. Your heart's intention, this Lord already knows."

Then, after a moment of thought, he instructed, "After we return to the Taihua Void Realm and things have settled down somewhat, find some time to go and see Lu Chuan. He will naturally inform you of some follow-up matters."

Although the core task was temporarily shelved due to his concerns, Xu Yunfan's loyalty and potential made him decide to continue using this person for other aspects.

Lu Chuan was another Foundation Establishment Great True Person under his command, a core figure of the Clear Source lineage. With him watching over it, the Clear Source True Lord wasn't worried that Xu Yunfan could stir up any trouble.

Xu Yunfan naturally had no objections and replied, "I shall strictly abide by the True Lord's decree! This disciple will surely seek out Senior Brother Lu for guidance as soon as possible."

In his heart, however, he was calculating rapidly. Seeking out Lu Chuan.

Was the opportunity on him?

But no matter what, being sent to see Lu Chuan meant that he had passed this stage for the time being.

Xu Yunfan bowed respectfully once more and slowly retreated from the Clear Source Stone Hall.

The misty, clear light behind him closed like a water curtain.

Stepping out of the hall, the violent scene that devoured the heavens and earth once again filled his sight. The Dao Realm of the Universal Salvation True Lord still occupied the sky, like a Gluttonous Beast.

But Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed slightly. He temporarily suppressed his thoughts and transformed into a stream of light, rushing towards the realm-breaking entrance at the periphery of the Heavenly Realm that connected to the Taihua Void Realm.

After returning to the Taihua Void Realm, breathing in the abundant and familiar spiritual energy of heaven and earth, Xu Yunfan finally let out a long sigh of relief.

Although in this place, True Lords engaged in all sorts of schemes and calculations, and even the channels for advancement were blocked, it was still relatively safe at the Foundation Establishment realm.

With his mind slightly settled, Xu Yunfan turned into a flash of thunderous light without hesitation, silently returning to the Divine Thunder Peak of the Primordial Origin Sect.

As soon as he entered his own cave dwelling, Xu Yunfan didn't have time to check the situation on the peak. He immediately followed the Cloud Sutra Avatar technique. Under the mandatory sharing link of the Attribute Panel, he submerged his consciousness into the avatar state.

This perception made his expression instantly tighten, his pupils contracting as he couldn't hide his immense surprise.

In his vision, on a solitary peak and sheer cliff within the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect where sword qi soared to the sky, a figure was seated cross-legged.

This boulder, as if cut by an invisible sword aura, hung abruptly above a ten-thousand-zhang sea of clouds. The violent wind was like a blade, yet it couldn't shake the figure seated cross-legged upon it.

The avatar, Han Shi, had a face quite different from Xu Yunfan's main body. Between his brows, it was as cold as frost. A sharp aura emanated from him, as if it could tear the sky apart and shake the heavens.

His eyes were tightly closed, his robes fluttering in the wind. There was no spiritual power aura leaking from him like an ordinary cultivator, but rather a condensed, tangible aura that could resonate with the heavens and earth.

Sword Intent!

This was not an illusory posture, but a manifestation of will as turbulent and surging as a raging sea. Layer upon layer, it rolled up invisible tempests, each one containing the power of bone-chilling anger and explosive destruction.

It was the true essence that arose when Han Shi cultivated the "Thousand Chariots Geng Sea Raging Wave Sword Art" to its profound depths, forging his own Rage-Slaying Sword Intent.

It meant that the more intense the fury, the stronger the sword intent.

It was a type of Seven Emotions Sword Intent.

Xu Yunfan's mind moved slightly, and the image became clear.

He saw deep within Han Shi's Dantian and Sea of Consciousness, the originally illusory and vague Sword Embryo form had completely vanished.

In its place stood a towering Throne of the Sword that Carries the Heavens.

The Sword Throne was deep blue in its entirety. Its base was formed from the materialization of countless raging wave sword intents, like a roaring, turbulent sea surging upwards, layer upon layer forging a solid platform. It emitted a majestic pressure that could suppress a space.

This Sword Throne was neither illusory nor real, but it symbolized that Han Shi had completely integrated his own will into the Origin of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Dao, laying an unshakable foundation for the subsequent Ten Thousand Changes Sword Dao.

He has actually already reached mid Foundation Establishment.

Xu Yunfan was ecstatic inside. The strong control mechanism of the Attribute Panel operated under his will, sharing the subtleties of the Sword Intent and the Sword Throne that Han Shi had enlightened upon to his main body's Sea of Consciousness in a one-way manner.

[You are experiencing the Rage-Slaying Sword Intent]

He immediately understood. The completion of the Throne of the Sword that Carries the Heavens meant that Han Shi had passed the core Foundation Establishment ceremony of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

This Sword Throne was the unique mark of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, signifying that his sword Dao foundation had been completely integrated into the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect's system, giving him the qualification to stand as a true disciple.
