# Chapter 18: Obtaining the Spirit Field  

"Ah, what a shame!"  

After retesting Gu Mo's spiritual roots, Zhao Qiancheng couldn't help but sigh deeply. They were still of the lowest grade. Gu Mo had managed to master the Cleansing Technique to perfection and had learned the Minor Cloud Rain Technique in just three months—such comprehension ability was undoubtedly on par with the prodigies of the inner sect.  

Yet, Gu Mo's spiritual roots were of the lowest grade, meaning he had almost no chance of reaching the Foundation Establishment stage. Even advancing from the early to the mid-stage of Qi Refining would be a significant hurdle.  

Unless he were to be showered with an enormous amount of resources, it was possible to push a cultivator through the Qi Refining stage. However, the cost-effectiveness was abysmal. The resources required for a cultivator with the lowest-grade spiritual roots to advance just one minor stage could be enough for those with mid-to-high-grade spiritual roots to progress several stages.  

Precisely because of this poor cost-effectiveness, even if Gu Mo's exceptional comprehension became known, the sect would never invest in him. In the early stages of cultivation, the importance of spiritual roots far outweighed comprehension. Only in the later stages would comprehension become the more critical factor.  

And the thought of pouring enough resources into Gu Mo—a cultivator with the lowest-grade spiritual roots—to reach the later stages was enough to make anyone's scalp tingle. The sheer amount of resources required could instead be used to nurture several cultivators of the same level.  

That said, Gu Mo could still become an outstanding spirit farmer. With his comprehension, there was a strong possibility he could master all five spirit farming techniques.  

A spirit farmer who had mastered all five techniques would hold a higher status than most ordinary outer sect disciples. Currently, the Spirit Plant Hall had three veteran spirit farmers who had mastered all five techniques, and even outer sect disciples treated them with respect. After all, whenever an emergency arose in their spirit fields, they would inevitably need to seek their help.  

If the Spirit Plant Hall could gain another spirit farmer who had mastered all five techniques, it would undoubtedly be a great boon.  

With this in mind, Zhao Qiancheng's gaze toward Gu Mo grew noticeably warmer. Moreover, now that Gu Mo had successfully learned the Minor Cloud Rain Technique and passed the assessment, it was the perfect opportunity to promote this achievement.  

Thus, Zhao Qiancheng brought Gu Mo before the group of servant disciples who had been forcibly assigned to the Spirit Plant Hall and announced that Gu Mo had earned the benefits of an outer sect disciple. Additionally, Zhao Qiancheng exempted Gu Mo from rent for three years and provided him with first-grade spirit seeds for free during that period.  

The moment this news was announced, the servant disciples' eyes filled with envy. Many of them regretted their decisions deeply—had they known, they would have voluntarily joined the Spirit Plant Hall to enjoy such benefits. As for the assessment required to obtain these benefits, it was conveniently ignored.  

Seeing the regret on the servant disciples' faces, Zhao Qiancheng nodded in satisfaction. These current servant disciples weren't his real target—the next batch was. By then, Gu Mo's example would spread, and it would undoubtedly serve as a strong incentive for future recruits.  

After offering some encouragement to the servant disciples, Zhao Qiancheng left.  

"Indeed, revealing a bit of talent has its advantages," Gu Mo thought to himself as he watched Zhao Qiancheng depart.  

This was part of his plan—to display his exceptional comprehension in spell cultivation, providing a plausible explanation for his uniqueness while reducing unwanted attention. Moreover, showcasing his talent would earn him greater favor from the Spirit Plant Hall.  

The three-year rent exemption and free spirit seeds were the rewards for revealing his aptitude.  

"Junior Brother Gu, these are the unclaimed spirit fields. Choose one," Mai Yunfa said, spreading out a map in the Spirit Plant Hall's archives and pointing at the scattered green squares.  

The spirit field Gu Mo could rent wasn't part of the vast, interconnected fields within the valley but rather one of the smaller, scattered plots outside.  

The formation of spirit fields was entirely dependent on the distribution of underground spirit veins. The large, continuous fields in the valley were the result of numerous intertwined spirit veins, while the scattered fields outside were formed by smaller, branching veins.  

These scattered fields were harder to manage than the continuous ones, and with limited manpower, they were the first to be abandoned. Thus, the Spirit Plant Hall decided to rent them out to servant disciples who voluntarily joined.  

As the first servant disciple to take the initiative to join under this new policy, Gu Mo also earned the privilege of first pick.  

"Senior Brother Mai, I'll take this one," Gu Mo said after scanning the map and pointing at one of the smaller squares.  

According to the map's markings, this field was about one acre in size—relatively small—but it was a mid-grade first-tier spirit field. There were other fields of the same grade, but Gu Mo had chosen the largest among them. The higher the grade of the spirit field, the faster the spirit plants would grow.  

"Good choice! I'll register it for you right away," Mai Yunfa said, unsurprised by Gu Mo's selection. After all, given the choice between a low-grade and mid-grade first-tier field, even a fool would pick the latter—unless there were significant drawbacks, such as an extremely small size or frequent pest infestations. The field Gu Mo had chosen had no such issues.  

"Come, I'll take you to get some tools," Mai Yunfa said, handing Gu Mo a lease agreement for the spirit field before leading him to collect farming tools like hoes and sickles.  

Of course, if one mastered all five spirit farming techniques, these tools would become unnecessary. The Minor Earth Dragon Technique could replace the hoe for tilling, and the Minor Gengjin Sword Qi could not only eliminate pests but also harvest spirit plants.  

The only tool that couldn't be replaced by a spirit farming technique was a magical artifact cottage. Since Gu Mo's chosen field was outside the valley, it would be impractical for him to constantly travel back and forth.  

Moreover, with his Sunflower planted in the field, Gu Mo wouldn't dare leave it unattended. Thus, he was destined to live near the field. Renting a magical artifact cottage from the Spirit Plant Hall was far better than building a crude hut himself.  

The cottage even came with protective formations, making it safer for secluded cultivation in the future.  

After gathering his supplies, Mai Yunfa summoned his flying sword and carried Gu Mo to the chosen field. "Junior Brother Gu, my task is complete. If you have any questions, feel free to come find me," he said before bidding farewell.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother Mai," Gu Mo replied politely.  

Once Mai Yunfa left, Gu Mo surveyed the spirit field. Contrary to his expectations, it wasn't overgrown. Even unclaimed fields received basic maintenance from the Spirit Plant Hall—it was their duty to ensure no registered fields fell into disrepair, lest the sect hold them accountable for the loss.  

After inspecting the field, Gu Mo placed the magical artifact cottage at its edge. Infusing it with spiritual energy, the cottage expanded like Mai Yunfa's flying sword, transforming into a small dwelling suitable for one person.  

The convenience of the artifact left Gu Mo envious. Unfortunately, such items were even more expensive than flying swords. Fortunately, as the first servant disciple to voluntarily join the Spirit Plant Hall, Gu Mo had received many benefits—not only rent exemption and free spirit seeds but also three years of free use of the cottage.  

"Alright, let's begin."  

After setting up the cottage, Gu Mo took out his hoe and prepared to till the field. At that moment, he regretted not learning the Minor Earth Dragon Technique first—then he wouldn't have had to till the land manually.
