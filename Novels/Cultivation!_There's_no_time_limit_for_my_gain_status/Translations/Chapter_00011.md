# Chapter 11 Psychological Counseling  

A few minutes later, Yan Hong came panting back with a contract scroll and a spirit brush in hand.  

The cheapest contract scroll cost five spirit stones, and the most basic spirit brush cost one spirit stone—their entire savings were now depleted.  

Yan Hong hunched over the dining table, scribbling furiously. Soon, a "pledge of allegiance" took shape under his brush.  

**[Pledge of Allegiance: To forge brotherhood; to entrust life and death to one another; to aid in fortune and adversity; to share blessings and hardships; to support each other in times of need...]**  

Of course, these were all just pretty words. The actual terms of the contract clearly stated that these obligations were one-sided.  

Jiang Li and Yan Hong signed their names as the pledge masters, after which others would sign as pledges.  

Aside from not deliberately sending them to their deaths, Yan Hong demanded that those who pledged serve them unconditionally for eighteen months.  

Though this was still exploitation and oppression, compared to two years of forced labor, it was undoubtedly a far better deal.  

For one, the duration was six months shorter. Even if Yan Hong took their entire monthly stipend every time, they could still cultivate. No matter what, it was better than wasting two precious years of their lives.  

"Hmm, the contract looks fine. But when choosing candidates, even among lower-grade spiritual roots, there are differences in quality. I remember a few names—we can prioritize them later."  

Among lower-grade spiritual roots, the more the spirit-testing orb was filled, the better the innate talent. Since they were picking, they might as well pick the best.  

"I know. Wait for my good news."  

With that, Yan Hong dashed out again.  

This time, he was gone for a while. As Jiang Li waited, he found a table to sit at. Soon, many hesitant preparatory disciples gathered around him, engaging in enthusiastic conversation.  

Especially Yan Fengyue and a few other pretty girls, who surrounded him with endless calls of "Brother Jiang" from left and right, making his ears tingle with delight.  

These people weren’t truly looking to pledge loyalty—they just wanted to huddle together for warmth. But at a time like this, boosting morale wasn’t a bad idea.  

Several more groups were led into the room, and the spacious lounge quickly grew livelier.  

Among them was a group of boys and girls dressed in coarse hemp clothes, their faces weathered, clearly a year or two older than the others.  

These were likely the children who had been forced into labor two years prior.  

They huddled in a corner like quails, not daring to speak loudly, not daring to eat too much, their eyes devoid of the curiosity and vitality typical of youth.  

Though they were the largest group—likely numbering over a thousand—they were eerily silent, forming a stark contrast to the boisterous alliances being forged elsewhere.  

These were people who had been beaten down by society, their edges worn away by the cruelty of the world. Even if they eventually became part of the cultivation world, they would remain at the bottom, toiling away.  

Come to think of it, wasn’t this just like his past life as an office drone?  

Where there are people, there will be hierarchy. Where there is hierarchy, there will be exploitation. Some things never change, no matter the world.  

And the only way to escape being exploited is to exploit others...  

Yan Hong’s plan was a brutal form of primitive capital accumulation—the first step toward climbing the social ladder.  

Of course, in a world of immortals, demons, gods, and ghosts, everything ultimately came down to strength. Without enough power to protect oneself, no matter how many spirit stones one earned, they would remain rootless and fleeting.  

After some time, just as Fu Zhong reappeared to organize everyone for departure, Yan Hong finally returned—fashionably late.  

Behind him trailed nineteen preparatory disciples who looked as if they had narrowly escaped disaster—ten boys and nine girls.  

"This is my sworn brother, Jiang Li. Show your respect!"  

"Brother Jiang Li!"  

Under Yan Hong’s stern command, the nineteen youths bowed deeply to Jiang Li at a perfect ninety-degree angle. They remained bent, not daring to straighten until they received a response.  

Jiang Li gave Yan Hong a surprised look. He hadn’t expected this fatty to have such skills. Was he also a transmigrator? Had he studied human resources management in his past life?  

Yan Hong smirked smugly, leaned in, and whispered a few words to Jiang Li before handing him the pledge contract for safekeeping.  

Turns out, the reason he had taken so long was that he had seized the moment to conduct psychological counseling (brainwashing) for these nineteen individuals.  

Judging by their disciplined obedience, the counseling had been quite effective.  

"Alright, rise."  

Only when Jiang Li spoke did they dare to stand straight, though they still kept their heads lowered, not daring to meet his or Yan Hong’s gaze.  

"Follow us onto the ship first."  

The Ascension Assembly wasn’t held at the Ascension Pavilion. Around the pavilion, a prosperous mortal city had been built.  

Most cultivators disliked the clamor of the mortal world, so the annual Ascension Assembly was always held on an island in the middle of the lake behind the Ascension Pavilion.  

Except...  

"Jiang Li, are you sure this thing is a ship? And that’s a lake?"  

Yan Hong tugged at Jiang Li’s sleeve and whispered, unwilling to lose face in front of their new subordinates.  

"Ahem, no need to make a fuss. So what if it’s a bit bigger?"  

Jiang Li boarded the towering ship—at least twenty meters tall—with composure, gazing at the vast, rolling lake that stretched beyond sight.  

He had already noticed something: this world seemed far larger than Earth in his past life, as if everything had been scaled up.  

So a lake the size of the Mediterranean? Perfectly reasonable.  

A single ship capable of carrying over two thousand people? Also perfectly reasonable.  

According to the information Yan Hong had gathered from Fu Zhong, the voyage would take only a day. By this time tomorrow, they would arrive at the lake’s central island.  

Jiang Li observed that despite its massive size, the ship seemed to employ some special technique, as its speed was anything but slow. Even so, a full day and night of sailing meant the lake was astonishingly vast.  

Using Yan Hong’s status as a top-grade spiritual root holder, they secured a spacious, comfortable room.  

Jiang Li gathered the nineteen subordinates and, following Yan Hong’s lead, conducted his own session of psychological counseling.  

"Relax. Neither Yan Hong nor I are bad people. From now on, don’t worry too much—just follow us and work hard."  

"Look at yourselves, then look at us. We’re a young, vibrant group with boundless potential. As long as you obey orders and endure hardships now, when our organization grows strong and carves out its own territory, you’ll be its founding members. We’ll never mistreat you."  

"Being strict with you now, pushing you to work hard—this isn’t for our sake, but for yours. For all of us to seek immortality and eternal life together. Tell me, do you want to become immortals?"  

Subordinates: "Yes!"  

"Do you want eternal life?"  

Subordinates: "Yes!"  

"Good! You’re all outstanding! I don’t care about talent or ability—I care about attitude!"  

"Show me your attitude!"  

Subordinates: "Work hard! Work hard! Work hard!" *Clap clap clap!*  

"Show me your determination!"  

Subordinates: "Strive! Strive! Strive!" *Clap clap clap!*  

By the time they left, all nineteen faces were flushed red, their cheeks swollen. Yet no one could understand why they wore such bright smiles, their eyes brimming with hope for the future.
