Chapter 275: The Taboo Candle Cult, the芥虚 Demon Robe, the Mistress's Turbid Robe, and the Beauty

Nangong Liuli’s beautiful face showed a hint of color. The flower boat sailed through the rocky forest, occasionally shaking as it struck the reefs. She swayed left and right like a wind chime, having long grown accustomed to it, treating it as a daily occurrence. She began discussing the mysteries of the Turbid Robe with Li Xian.

She said, "The Turbid Robe is a matter of fate. Its characteristics are divided into three tiers and nine categories. The lowest tier is the 'Tattered Rags.'"

Li Xian asked curiously, "Tattered Rags?" He was quite intrigued. Wen Caishang was extremely skilled in the 'Turbid Robe Donned' characteristic, and her words often concealed a hint of pride. He had once curiously inquired about the characteristics of the Second Realm. Wen Caishang had spoken a little, but never went into detail. Yet, she was generous in teaching the miscellaneous arts of various paths, willing to impart everything.

Actually, Wen Caishang was also willing to teach martial knowledge. Her man must not be mediocre; he must shine through the ages. Only then would she love him to the extreme and cherish him to the extreme. However, she was wary of his talent yet loved him to the bone. She wanted to slow down his cultivation progress, then carefully nurture him so that he would belong to her alone.

Nangong Liuli said, "The so-called 'Tattered Rags' are like a beggar's attire. It is tattered and lets in the wind; it cannot keep out the cold, nor can it provide defense. It is utterly useless."

"Most martial artists of the Second Realm in the world have Tattered Rags. With this Turbid Robe characteristic, the wonders of donning a Turbid Robe have nothing to do with them."

Li Xian was very surprised. He nodded and pondered silently: "That Black-faced Bat King was a Second Realm martial artist, having experienced the ethereal fairy sound, the convergence of three flowers at the crown, and the donning of a Turbid Robe. When I fought him, I did not see him display the mysteries of the Turbid Robe. Presumably, he had Tattered Rags, which inherently have no mysteries."

Nangong Liuli’s pretty face flushed slightly. Having talked for a long time, her mouth was dry. She said, "The mysteries of the Turbid Robe are extremely numerous; it might take a long time to explain. First, feed me some water."

Li Xian untied the water pouch and helped Nangong Liuli drink. Her mouth was dry, and she drank from the pouch's mouth as if drinking sweet dew. Suddenly, she realized that this pouch was carried by Li Xian, and he must often drink directly from it. She couldn't help but blush deeply. But then she thought, since she could no longer escape, could she still preserve her innocence? Being defiled was inevitable. At least Hua Wucoo was handsome, far superior to other flower thieves. Though she felt sad, given the situation, she had no choice but to adapt and accept it.

Nangong Liuli continued: "The second type of Turbid Robe is called 'Plain Cloth Attire,' like the clothes of ordinary commoners. Simple but neat."

Li Xian thought: "These secrets... if I don't figure them out in advance, I might be at a disadvantage without knowing why. The path of martial arts has a high threshold. Families have cultivation systems studied for hundreds, even thousands of years. We wandering cultivators... can only stumble around blindly."

He asked: "What is the use of 'Plain Cloth Attire'?"

Nangong Liuli rolled her eyes and asked: "What do you think is the use of the clothes worn by ordinary commoners?"

Li Xian said: "To cover the body and keep out the cold?" Upon hearing the words "cover the body," Nangong Liuli's face flushed slightly. When she was captured and bound, she was wearing exquisite dress. Her clothes were still intact, but when the flower boat hit the reef and the waves surged, the boat shook violently. Whether her skirt could cover her body was hard to say. But she could do nothing about it; aside from shame, she could only endure and accept it.

Nangong Liuli said: "This type of Turbid Robe is of little use, almost useless. But it is slightly better than 'Tattered Rags.' It can cover the whole body. Its ability to keep out the cold... is indeed slightly better than that of ordinary mud-bodied mortals."

"The third type of Turbid Robe is called 'Brocade Furnace Robe.' It is superior to 'Plain Cloth Attire,' but if you speak of miraculous uses, apart from being slightly better at keeping out the cold, it is really useless."

"Although it has no use, those who are bestowed with a 'Brocade Furnace Robe' belong to the upper echelon of the Second Realm. Their foundation, fate, and martial arts... are all top-notch."

Li Xian secretly nodded. Hearing the three types—'Tattered Rags,' 'Plain Cloth Attire,' and 'Brocade Furnace Robe'—he did not look down on them. He found them quite peculiar and recalled the many Second Realm martial artists he had encountered. The elders of the prefecture city, for example, were probably all at the level of the Brocade Furnace Robe.

Nangong Liuli saw Li Xian drinking directly from the pouch, his cheeks slightly flushed. She averted her gaze, her heart pounding. Li Xian asked: "What comes after?"

Nangong Liuli said: "These three categories belong to the lower tier. Next is the middle tier of Turbid Robes."

"The fourth category is 'Gathering Turbid Gauze Robe.' This type of Turbid Robe is light and envelops the whole body, formless and substanceless, fluttering like gauze, hence the name 'Gauze Robe.' It is light but can resist fists and feet. If the wearer focuses on defense, fists and feet cannot penetrate the body."

"If one dons this robe, they can be called outstanding among their peers. Do you know of Vajra Temple?"

Li Xian recalled the "Martial Madman." His Vajra Palm was extremely powerful, enough to injure Wen Caishang. Although Wen Caishang was weakened by lightning injuries at the time, she had easily killed the Four Heroes of Taixin. This shows how powerful the Martial Madman's palm strength was.

Nangong Liuli said: "Vajra Temple is located in the Western Regions. Their martial arts are extremely fierce. They have a set of martial arts called 'Vajra Shield.' Only those with a middle-tier Turbid Robe can display its power."

"One who wears a 'Gathering Turbid Gauze Robe' and executes the 'Vajra Shield' will have golden light burst forth, with the Gathering Turbid Gauze Robe faintly visible. The Vajra Shield combines hardness and softness, extremely formidable!"

Li Xian asked: "Have you seen it?" Nangong Liuli said: "Not only have I seen it, but I have also seen it many times. Vajra Temple and other Western Regions Buddhist temples come to Daoxuan Mountain every few years to debate scriptures and discuss martial arts. It is a grand event in the martial world."

Li Xian was very curious and listened intently. He asked again: "What comes after?"

Nangong Liuli said: "After the 'Gathering Turbid Gauze Robe' is the 'Pure Vitality Turbid Robe.' If one dons this layer of Turbid Robe, they are truly a dragon among men, a phoenix feather or a unicorn horn—extremely rare."

"Of course... the Turbid Robe is determined by fate, but man can sometimes surpass heaven. Even with Tattered Rags, there is a day when one can climb to the peak, capture the stars, and seize the moon."

"The 'Pure Vitality Turbid Robe' can only be worn by those with great fortune. Their Turbid Robes are extremely strong. They tightly protect the whole body; even if an ordinary mud-bodied mortal hacks with a knife with all their strength, it would be difficult to harm a single hair!"

"Moreover, one can conceal their Vitality within the Turbid Robe. It can shake off and counter attacks, with infinite wonderful uses. My Nangong family has a set of 'Donning Robe Fist Techniques.' It relies heavily on the 'Pure Vitality Turbid Robe.' If one possesses a Pure Vitality Turbid Robe and then practices the Donning Robe Fist Technique, they will definitely be extremely powerful."

Her beautiful eyes were hazy. The Donning Robe Fist Technique requires the martial artist to wear a specially made robe, covering their fists under the sleeves. When punching, they do not injure others with fists or feet, but with the killing intent brought by the sleeves. Inner Vitality flows within the robe; a gentle stroke of the sleeve hides a thousand fists and ten thousand strengths.

Imagine it... if one wears an invisible 'Pure Vitality Turbid Robe.' Then executes the Donning Robe Fist Technique. The invisible sleeves could shake, stroke, pat, or cover... achieving many unbelievable feats. Taking things from afar, a feint to the east but striking the west, injuring the enemy invisibly, combining offense and defense, making it hard to guard against.

Furthermore, the 'Pure Vitality Turbid Robe' can store Vitality in the robe. In actual combat, it adds infinite wonderful changes.

Li Xian asked: "Then what kind of Turbid Robe do you have?" Nangong Liuli said: "I received heaven's favor and luckily have a 'Gathering Turbid Gauze Robe.' Although I know the Donning Robe Fist Technique, I cannot display the power of Uncle Gong. I am truly unworthy of the cultivation."

Her words were truly modest. The Second Realm of martial arts has four major characteristics. The Turbid Robe is determined by heaven, entirely depending on fate. Her 'Gathering Turbid Gauze Robe' is already extraordinary, belonging to the forefront of her peers. Combined with her deep research in the ethereal fairy sound, her ability is actually very strong.

Li Xian secretly felt that the "Nangong family" was powerful. From Nangong Liuli's words, there were 'Pure Vitality Turbid Robe' experts in the family. And based on this characteristic, they had practiced formidable martial arts.

Li Xian asked: "What comes after?" Nangong Liuli let out a startled cry as she was shaken left and right. Her long hair fluttered; with every sway of the boat, her toes couldn't help but tense up, nervous and helpless.

After swaying for a long while, Nangong Liuli calmed her breathing and said: "The next type of Turbid Robe is extremely rare. It is called 'Golden Tower Jade Robe.' This type of Turbid Robe belongs to the highest category of the middle tier."

"Those bestowed with this robe are not afraid of sword slashes, can resist fire attacks, and their Vitality does not leak or reveal. Even after death, their body will not decay!"

"One who wears this Turbid Robe is truly precious to the extreme. Legend has it that after death, the Vitality does not leak. If one practices a certain type of martial arts, they might be able to die and come back to life, living a second life. I have only heard of it, and do not know if it is true."

Li Xian heard "die and come back to life" and secretly felt that martial arts were so miraculous. He asked curiously: "Does the Nangong family have such a person?"

Nangong Liuli remained silent. This matter involves family secrets; how could she speak lightly?

Li Xian smiled and let it go, asking again: "The middle tier is already so powerful. Is the upper tier of Turbid Robes even more heaven-defying?"

Nangong Liuli said: "Those who can obtain an upper-tier Turbid Robe are absolutely not ordinary people. Upper-tier Turbid Robes are extremely rare; there is really no distinction of strength or weakness, it all depends on how one uses them. The seventh type of Turbid Robe is called..."

Suddenly, a voice came: "Called 'Ten Thousand Generations Dragon Robe'!"

In the narrow boat passage, Ye Cheng walked over slowly. He was elegant and refined, not like a flower thief, but more like a literati or scholar.

Nangong Liuli turned her head to look. Because the cell was very narrow, her vision was limited. She could only hear footsteps, not see the person. But knowing it was Ye Cheng approaching, she couldn't help but frown.

Li Xian looked up and cupped his hands: "Elder Ye, why have you come? I was bored, so I chatted with this woman. If it violates the rules, I will immediately seal her mouth."

Ye Cheng patted Li Xian's shoulder. He said: "You've already sealed it all the way; letting her speak a bit is fine."

It turned out that...

The conversation between Li Xian and Nangong Liuli passed through the gaps in the cell and into Ye Cheng's ears.

He heard Li Xian discussing the "Turbid Robe" with Nangong Liuli. He thought that Bian Qiaoqiao had died in the belly of a fish, and Nangong Liuli was her close friend. Her mental state must be unstable. If she were brought into the "Water Altar" and went mad or became idiotic, that would be terrible. So he personally came to talk with her, observing her mental state.

Ye Cheng smiled: "Miss Liuli, long time no see. How have you been?"

Nangong Liuli said coldly: "Excellent. Food is served to my mouth; how could it not be good?"

Ye Cheng heard Nangong Liuli's sharp words and her ability to sarcastically retort, her anger barely concealed. Her mental outlook was extremely lively. He couldn't help but feel a little happy.

Leisurely, Ye Cheng asked: "You were just discussing the 'Turbid Robe,' were you not?"

Li Xian said: "Yes. Disciple was curious, so I asked."

Ye Cheng asked curiously: "Since you ask about the characteristics of the Turbid Robe, you must at least have the attainment of consuming Essence. You said you are a wandering cultivator; where did this attainment of consuming Essence come from?"

Li Xian pondered: "The Flower Cage Sect was besieged by many enemies, and disciples suffered heavy casualties.对外宣稱‘有教無類’，實則是拉人入伙，共乘賊船。對入門者過往來歷，向來不多追究。" He said: "I encountered a fortuitous opportunity and consumed an Essence Treasure."

Ye Cheng glanced at him, believing or not, but he didn't care at all.

He said: "Young heroes indeed have common topics. If I had known Miss Liuli was bored, I would have sent someone to chat with you to relieve boredom."

"Yes, you were just talking about the 'Ten Thousand Generations Dragon Robe.' If you don't mind, please continue."

Nangong Liuli frowned, unwilling to speak more. After a moment of silence, Ye Cheng smiled: "Miss Liuli, please continue."

Nangong Liuli frowned and pondered. Realizing her hands and feet were bound, she was the fish on the chopping block. She had no choice but to endure the humiliation and continue: "The so-called 'Ten Thousand Generations Dragon Robe' is the only Turbid Robe that condenses into a solid form and is passed down for ten thousand generations. It has a dragon crown, tassels, a dragon robe, dragon shoes... many parts. Only the supreme and noble person, the emperor of the current world, can wear the 'Ten Thousand Generations Dragon Robe' to display majesty and command heaven and earth."

"When the emperor of the dynasty changes, the 'Ten Thousand Generations Dragon Robe' is exchanged, and the power of the dynasty is handed over."

Ye Cheng nodded repeatedly. The Great Wu Dynasty's territory is vast; the common people, standing on tiptoe and craning their necks, cannot even see a corner of the heavenly palace. They do not know who is the monarch and who is the minister. The undercurrents and conflicts of interest... only those from noble families, who are influenced from childhood, can speak of them easily.

That deep palace in the heavenly palace, with dragon-like majesty and countenance... is not something just anyone can glimpse.

He sincerely praised: "Truly worthy of being a scion of a great family. Your vision and knowledge are indeed extraordinary."

Nangong Liuli felt disdain in her heart and said淡淡ly: "The power of the dynasty is passed down through generations. The Ten Thousand Generations Dragon Robe is also passed down from generation to generation. The name 'Ten Thousand Generations' comes from this."

"Each time it is passed down, there is an additional dragon pattern. When the dynasty is in turmoil and collapses, the dragon robe will dissipate. At this time, a new Son of Heaven must emerge to rectify the chaotic world, gather the fortune of heaven and earth, and condense the Ten Thousand Generations Dragon Robe again. To change the dynasty."

"Legend has it that the Great Wu Taizu overthrew the rule of the Yu Dynasty. Tens of thousands of weavers sewed the dragon robe, inside which were hidden the solar terms, calendar, four seasons, farming times, various industries, dragon might, power... One robe, extremely complex. It aimed to condense all things in the world into the dragon robe. If someone glimpses it, they could悟出 martial arts."

Ye Cheng clapped his hands and praised: "Good knowledge, good knowledge!"

He continued: "Now the Great Wu is about to be in chaos, the dragon robe is about to scatter. There is strife everywhere, undercurrents surging. Your Nangong family is a famous and influential family, the first to bear the brunt. You should be an example for the world, or support the weak martial artists, or start a new enterprise..."

Nangong Liuli sneered: "I am just a captured woman. How would I know my family's plans? Telling me these things is extremely boring."

Ye Cheng said: "Then please tell me about the next type of Turbid Robe." He greatly admired Nangong Liuli's conversation and vision.

Nangong Liuli said: "The eighth type of Turbid Robe should be 'Wonderful Flower Heavenly Robe.'"

"What is its function?" Ye Cheng asked.

Nangong Liuli said sternly: "The 'Wonderful Flower Heavenly Robe' is rarely heard of in the world. How would I know its function?"

Ye Cheng smiled: "You cannot possibly not know. Daoxuan Mountain has a 'Wonderful Flower Heavenly Robe.'" Nangong Liuli's pupils contracted slightly. She said sternly: "Your Flower Cage Sect is so daring, even daring to target a Jade Maiden?"

Ye Cheng laughed: "When has the Flower Cage Sect not been daring? The ability of the grand 'Wonderful Flower Heavenly Robe'—if we don't try it out, how can we be satisfied?"

Nangong Liuli said: "Overestimating your capabilities. Don't invite a fatal disaster. The talent of Daoxuan Mountain's Jade Maiden is far more terrifying than you imagine."

Ye Cheng said: "Hahaha, no need for you to worry."

Li Xian asked: "Elder Ye, what is the use of this 'Wonderful Flower Heavenly Robe'?"

Ye Cheng clasped his hands behind his back, paced, and said: "The 'Wonderful Flower Heavenly Robe' is bestowed by heaven. Legend has it that it uses cloud dew as clothing, pinches colorful clouds as a shawl, the moonlight shines solely on her, and the sun's light lingers unwilling to leave. It is truly: flowing light and overflowing color, as light as a startled swan, as graceful as a swimming dragon... Every movement contains a fairy's charm."

Nangong Liuli pondered. It seemed the Flower Cage Sect had already researched Daoxuan Mountain's Jade Maiden. A spear in the open is easy to avoid, but a dagger in the dark is hard to guard against... This was ultimately not a good thing.

Ye Cheng smiled: "The last type of Turbid Robe, please tell me." Nangong Liuli said in a muffled voice: "This type of Turbid Robe is even rarer than the 'Wonderful Flower Heavenly Robe.' What is the use of speaking of it?"

Ye Cheng said: "Since you have already spoken of the first eight types of Turbid Robes, please tell me the last one. It is good to have a beginning and an end, is it not?"

Since she was captured and bound, she had no choice. She continued: "The ninth type of Turbid Robe is the '芥虚 Demon Robe.' Although I like to read classics, there are very few records of this Turbid Robe. I only know that so far, no one has possessed it."

"Wrong. If no one possesses it, how could there be records?" Ye Cheng smiled.

Nangong Liuli asked curiously: "Then why do the family classics..."

Ye Cheng said: "Naturally, it is because you all are unwilling to record it."

Nangong Liuli said: "Then please tell me. I really don't know this part."

Ye Cheng said:

"The '芥虚 Demon Robe' is extremely rare; it may not appear for hundreds or thousands of years. But in the long river of history, there are always rare geniuses, favored by heaven!"

"But some geniuses are so terrifying to a certain extent that even the classical books and records are unwilling to record them!"

"Do you know why the 芥虚 Demon Robe is called the 芥虚 Demon Robe?"

Nangong Liuli shook her head in confusion. Ye Cheng smiled: "Your experience is still shallow after all."

"If my Flower Cage Sect traces back, it is a branch of a Demon Cult."

Nangong Liuli exclaimed: "Could it be the Candle Cult?"

Ye Cheng smiled: "Your reaction is quite fast! Yes, it is indeed the Candle Cult!"

Nangong Liuli understood in her heart. If it is the Candle Cult, it is no wonder the family classics are unwilling to record it. She said: "The Candle Cult shocked the world, a taboo and forbidden existence. To have fallen to the point of capturing women, a vulgar sect. Truly ironic."

Ye Cheng said: "You overestimate us. The Candle Cult is so terrifying; it is fragmented and scattered across the world. My Flower Cage Sect is just a tiny remnant; how dare we represent the Candle Cult."

Ye Cheng said: "The Candle Cult's Sect Master Guo... was once a 芥虚 Demon Robe. Actually, classical records state that the 芥虚 Demon Robe was originally called the 芥虚 Heavenly Robe. Because of my Candle Cult's reputation, it was renamed the 芥虚 Demon Robe."

Nangong Liuli sighed: "No matter how glorious, it is a thing of the past. There is no one with this Demon Robe in the current world."

"Wrong again!" Ye Cheng said: "They say heroes emerge in troubled times. There is indeed one 芥虚 Demon Robe in the current world."

Nangong Liuli was startled, her beautiful eyes full of wonder. She asked: "Who?"

Li Xian frowned slightly, having a premonition. Ye Cheng said: "The折剑 Mistress!"

Nangong Liuli said: "The折剑 Mistress?" Ye Cheng said: "This woman acts ruthlessly, is extremely knowledgeable, and her martial arts are extremely strong. When planning matters, she often goes straight to the point. She never deliberately reveals her whereabouts, nor does she deliberately keep a low profile."

"Because of this style of acting, her reputation is not great. Those who know her fear her like a ghost. Many heroes and good men fear her martial arts and her methods. They are ashamed to speak of her because they have all suffered great losses and are afraid she will come to their door. So those who do not know her have never heard of her reputation."

Nangong Liuli exclaimed: "In the martial world, there is actually such a person."

Ye Cheng said: "She is the 芥虚 Demon Robe. My Flower Cage Sect, because of its connection to the Candle Cult, knows of this."

"Speaking of which... because of this matter, the Flower Cage Sect harassed her several times. She is ruthless with her sword, no joke. At that time, she was not as old as you. Truly... truly terrifying."

His face showed fear; they had been crushed and fled everywhere, suffering heavy casualties.

Nangong Liuli found it very satisfying.

Li Xian suddenly realized. He pondered: "The Mistress has a White Snake Soft Sword hidden in her sleeve. I stripped her clothes and took everything. I searched inside and out several times, but I never found the soft sword. It turned out to be stored in the Turbid Robe, disappearing into thin air!"

Li Xian marveled: "An upper-tier Turbid Robe is indeed exquisite."

Tattered Rags, Plain Cloth Attire, Brocade Furnace Robe, Gathering Turbid Gauze Robe, Pure Vitality Turbid Robe, Golden Tower Jade Robe, Ten Thousand Generations Dragon Robe, Wonderful Flower Heavenly Robe, 芥虚 Demon Robe.

Nine types of Turbid Robes, nine characteristics. The Second Realm of martial arts is a watershed. The ethereal fairy sound, the convergence of three flowers at the crown, the donning of the Turbid Robe... are all very special, with many secrets to be found.

One who masters any of them can be called a master.

Li Xian asked: "Then does the convergence of three flowers at the crown have any special characteristics?"

Nangong Liuli said: "No." Ye Cheng nodded and said: "The most important characteristic of the Second Realm of martial arts is the 'ethereal fairy sound.' Don't look at the many categories of Turbid Robes; they are determined by fate. Most are Tattered Rags, Plain Cloth Attire... really of little use."

"Miss Liuli's Gathering Turbid Gauze Robe is already extremely rare."

Li Xian's mind was clear, and he was not anxious.

Nangong Liuli's thoughts churned. She had cultivated and nurtured her Vitality for many years, and it was time to show her brilliance. But she was captured by the Flower Cage Sect, her hands and feet bound. Hearing the endless excitement of the martial world, she felt only sadness and helplessness.

Ye Cheng said: "Miss Liuli... seeing that you are quite well-behaved, I have good news for you."

Nangong Liuli thought, what good news could this bandit leader have? Ye Cheng said: "We are about to arrive at the Water Altar, an important place for the Flower Cage Sect. You were supposed to be sold in the auction pavilion as a 'beautiful companion.'"

Nangong Liuli lightly bit her red lips, feeling utterly dark. Just hearing the words, she felt humiliated. A noble lady of the Nangong family, being treated like an object, auctioned off.

Ye Cheng continued: "However, the Water Altar is preparing a grand event. It is very lively, with young disciples participating. You will be the prize, awarded to the champion."

Nangong Liuli cursed: "Old bandit leader, what difference is there!" Tears welled up, extremely delicate and pitiful.

Ye Cheng smiled: "Naturally, there is a difference."

"You seem to get along quite well with Hua Wucoo. Just imagine, if he were to win the championship. You would be his."

Nangong Liuli thought: "Ah! This... this... is indeed much better than being auctioned off. If I really fall into his hands, after all... after all, his appearance is not bad." Her cheeks flushed.

Ye Cheng said: "Hua Wucoo, you must guard this woman well, don't let her escape. This is also very good news for you. You must cherish it! Strive for the championship!"

"Think about it... such a beautiful companion, serving you to sleep every night. Tsk tsk, how wonderful the taste would be. Since you were born of humble origins, normally speaking, if you were outside the Flower Cage Sect, for Nangong Liuli to even glance at you would be your honor. Now you have a chance to obtain her. Hahaha."

Nangong Liuli felt annoyed. Her heart pounded, and she looked Li Xian up and down several times. Unfortunately, the angle was biased, and the light was dim. She swayed left and right but couldn't get a clear view.

Ye Cheng saw Nangong Liuli's face flushed red and laughed. He said again: "During this period, you can try it out. If you really win the beauty, I will be extremely envious."

He turned and left.

Li Xian and Nangong Liuli looked at each other, both feeling awkward. Nangong Liuli asked shyly: "Hua little thief... you... will you participate in that competition?"

Li Xian said lazily: "I can't participate. My martial skills are not refined, so I won't stand out."

Nangong Liuli said: "I ask you to participate, okay?" Li Xian smiled: "What, do you want to be my beautiful companion?"

Nangong Liuli said: "Hmph, actually, you are no different from other flower thieves. Fine, my fate is miserable; whoever wants to ruin me, let it be!"

After a while, she said in a muffled voice: "But you are a little better after all."

Li Xian sighed: "Still no. After all, I... am not even worthy of carrying shoes for the wild dogs of Daoxuan Mountain."

Nangong Liuli's face was flushed red. She had previously cursed Li Xian with the most unpleasant words. She could only soften her voice and say: "Good young hero, good hero... please... please, I beg you."
