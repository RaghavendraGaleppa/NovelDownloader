# Chapter 3: The Five Animal Frolics  

Zhou Qing naturally didn't dare to meditate again, lest he experience another soul-leaving incident. First, he took deep breaths to calm his mind, and then, with a thought, he once again saw the book titled *The Master of Nourishing Life*—right there in his mind!  

A surge of information instantly flooded his awareness.  

*"I only have thirty years left to live?"*  

*"That short?"*  

This was the revelation Zhou Qing received from *The Master of Nourishing Life*. Had it not been for the book pulling his soul back into his body earlier, he had no idea what dangers he might have faced. Instinctively, he trusted this mysterious scripture that had inexplicably appeared in his mind—perhaps his transmigration was even connected to it.  

Before the soul-leaving incident and the appearance of *The Master of Nourishing Life*, Zhou Qing had planned to follow the orthodox path of imperial examinations to improve his current circumstances. But now, knowing he had only thirty years left, it felt like a bucket of cold water had been poured over him. Even if he succeeded in the exams, becoming a provincial scholar (*juren*) or even a metropolitan scholar (*jinshi*), it would take at least five years—if not a full decade of diligent study.  

By then, even if he achieved fame and fortune, married multiple beautiful wives, and had children and grandchildren, the time he could truly enjoy would amount to little more than twenty years.  

Zhou Qing found it hard to accept that his remaining life would be so brief. Even though he had already transmigrated once, who could guarantee he would get another chance?  

*"Normally, whether in modern times or ancient ones, living to seventy is common. Early death is usually due to illness, physical exhaustion, or lack of resources. My remaining lifespan being only thirty years likely means there’s something wrong with my current body."*  

Indeed, since transmigrating, his body had been weak. While a young man should be full of vitality, his current condition could only be described as sickly.  

*"The Master of Nourishing Life must be displaying my projected lifespan based on my current state. But this isn’t necessarily irreversible."*  

*"First, I should sleep and replenish my energy. I’ll think more about this tomorrow."*  

Having made these judgments, Zhou Qing had no intention of staying up late. Resting well and recovering his energy would, at the very least, help his current condition.  

Moreover, in preparation for the exams, he had barely rested in recent days. While studying, he had naturally felt energetic and sharp-minded, but this had likely taken a toll on his body. That heightened mental state had probably been more of a manifestation of his soul’s vigor, inadvertently draining his physical health. The greater damage, however, must have occurred during his earlier soul-leaving experience.  

---  

*"Cold moon and warm sun, they gnaw at a man’s years.*  
*Feast on bear and grow fat, feed on frogs and stay lean.*  
*Where is the Divine Lord? Where is the Great Unity?"*  

Zhou Qing dreamed of *"The Bitter Short Day"*, a poem by the Tang dynasty’s "Ghost Poet" Li He, and woke with a start. *"Feast on bear and grow fat, feed on frogs and stay lean."*  

Thoughts by day become dreams by night.  

His subconscious had conjured Li He’s poem out of anxiety over his current predicament.  

*"I absolutely must not follow in the footsteps of that great poet."*  

He had no intention of dying young.  

But his household had no bear meat—nor even frogs—only a barely sufficient gruel to fill his stomach.  

After eating, Zhou Qing checked *The Master of Nourishing Life* in his mind again. His remaining lifespan was still thirty years—a rough estimate.  

Instead of reading or reciting Confucian classics as usual, he carefully recalled the Five Animal Frolics (*Wu Qin Xi*) he had practiced in university. Back then, he had learned it out of curiosity, never expecting to recall every movement so vividly now.  

*"I wonder if this exercise can produce any extraordinary effects in this otherworld. Even if not, its health benefits alone make it worth practicing."*  

The Five Animal Frolics consisted of the Tiger, Deer, Bear, Monkey, and Bird forms. In ancient texts, the term *qin* (禽) referred broadly to beasts and birds, though its meaning later narrowed to birds alone.  

When Zhou Qing had first learned this exercise, his instructor had claimed to be an inheritor of internal martial arts, stating that while the Five Animal Frolics was primarily for health, it had evolved into a martial art over time.  

The Tiger form could be adapted into fist techniques, the Deer into legwork and lightness skills, the Bear for body conditioning, the Monkey for breath control, and the Bird for swordsmanship—supposedly a pinnacle of medical cultivation.  

At the time, it had all sounded mystifying, likely just the instructor’s way of drumming up enthusiasm. After practicing for a while without noticeable results, Zhou Qing had abandoned it in favor of swimming and jogging.  

Now, however, swimming and jogging were out of the question—given his condition, even a simple run might shorten his already limited lifespan.  

Despite the commercial prosperity of Jiangzhou City, urban sanitation was poor. Even officials had roads sprinkled with yellow earth and clean water before venturing out, just to suppress dust and mask other filth.  

*"The mortal world is muddy"* wasn’t just a metaphor—it was a literal description of the city’s environment.  

For now, Zhou Qing could only wait for the exam results before making further plans. Whether or not the examiner favored him, passing the preliminary exam (*xiucai*) would secure his position.  

But none of that was urgent. The real question was how to nurture his health.  

---  

*"Might as well make use of the time."*  

Zhou Qing began practicing the Five Animal Frolics.  

At first, his movements were rusty, but after one round, he grew more fluent. He noticed that while some postures were still beyond his current physical limits, those he could perform were executed exceptionally well.  

After five full rounds, he was drenched in sweat and his stomach growled loudly, but he felt invigorated.  

Too exhausted to continue, he sat on the edge of his bed to rest.  

Curious, he checked *The Master of Nourishing Life* again and received new information:  

*"Five Animal Frolics: Basic Proficiency."*  

This was the book’s assessment of his skill. Though his execution was smooth, certain movements remained imperfect due to physical limitations. *"Basic Proficiency"* seemed fair.  

His remaining lifespan hadn’t changed, but Zhou Qing wasn’t disappointed. Despite his hunger, his body felt more robust than before.  

*"If I persist, I’m sure things will improve."*  

Just then, someone knocked at the door.  

It was daytime now, so Zhou Qing wasn’t overly worried about another supernatural incident, but he still asked cautiously, *"Who is it?"*  

*"Young Master Zhou, it’s Old Hu."*  

Zhou Qing opened the door.  

Old Hu was a butcher from the neighboring street who had helped Zhou Qing arrange his parents’ funerals—though not without compensation. Butchers, whether in cities or villages, held a certain social standing, and Old Hu had played a significant role in ensuring the young Zhou Qing could manage the affairs smoothly.  

*"Brother Hu, there’s no need for such formalities—just call me by name. What brings you here?"*  

Old Hu grinned. *"The village schoolteacher left, and we’d like you to take over for a while. This is a token of our appreciation—please accept it. We’ll provide grain every ten days henceforth."*  

He handed over a jug of wine, a package of lotus-leaf-wrapped pastries, and several pieces of cured meat.  

Hu Village, though rural, was close to the city. Zhou Qing had visited its school before—classes lasted only half a day, so it wouldn’t interfere much with his schedule.  

Still, it was odd that Old Hu had come the day after the exams.  

But it wasn’t a bad offer. Given his circumstances, Zhou Qing had no reason to refuse.  

*"Thank you, Brother Hu. My pantry was nearly empty—your timing couldn’t be better. I’ll accept these gifts and start teaching tomorrow. How does that sound?"*
