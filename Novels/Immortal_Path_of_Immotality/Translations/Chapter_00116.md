# Chapter 116: The Ainu Sea (Major Revision)

Lin Shan surveyed the chaotic crowd in the square. He didn't believe all the rogue cultivators of the East Sea were such motley crew—clearly, the promising ones had already been picked by the "Lu Kingdom faction" cultivators.

Aside from him, there were over a dozen local faction Foundation Establishment cultivators present, each frowning in contemplation. Their expressions darkened further upon hearing some shameless individuals below proposing unspeakable transactions.

Eventually, Lin Shan and the other Foundation Establishment cultivators reached an agreement to divide the late-stage Qi Refining cultivators among themselves. Three late-stage Qi Refining rogue cultivators chose to follow Lin Shan, while the rest had to make do with mid-stage Qi Refining recruits to fill their quotas.

Once he'd assembled his hundred-man team, Lin Shan wasted no time. He gathered his subordinates and circulated the mission manual among them.

"This is the task. Whether you believe in the Black Lotus Sect or not is irrelevant—what matters is getting mortals to faithfully worship the Black Lotus Buddha statues."

"Use whatever means necessary, but the worship must be sincere. Coercion doesn't count."

"Those who complete the mission first will be credited with major merits. Only with sufficient merits will you have the chance to formally join a major demonic sect."

"If I catch anyone slacking off, I'll... extract their soul and refine their essence!"

Lin Shan alternated between carrots and sticks—dangling rewards while making threats. Though he'd reached Foundation Establishment, he hadn't actually learned soul extraction techniques. But as a demonic sect envoy, his claim was accepted without question. 

The hundred East Sea rogue cultivators trembled under his ominous words, nodding like frightened chicks. The reputation of "demonic sects" was terrifying enough—had Lin Shan claimed to eat people, some might have believed him. This fear stemmed from centuries of slander by righteous sects of the Great Song Dynasty, who'd demonized the three ancient demonic sects until they became synonymous with terror and bloodshed.

After issuing instructions, Lin Shan distributed a hundred storage pouches containing hundreds of newly crafted Black Lotus Buddha statues each. These were just the first batch—more would follow to meet the massive demand across the East Sea's countless islands. Each statue bore a unique serial number for precise tracking of faithful worship.

The sect strictly prohibited unauthorized creation of statues or collection of faith. Of all their lax rules, this was the one strictly enforced. The thought made Lin Shan irritable as he warned his subordinates before summoning his high-grade magic tool—the Descending Cloud Banner.

As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he could fly by manipulating objects, hence why only those at his level could lead teams. The banner expanded to thirty meters as he channeled spiritual power, then he ordered his hundred subordinates to board in single file.

With a dramatic wave, Lin Shan commanded: "Depart!"

The banner didn't budge. His men exchanged bewildered looks.

"Depart!" he repeated through gritted teeth.

Only then did he realize that while Foundation Establishment allowed object manipulation, heavier loads required more spiritual power. Carrying a hundred people (weighing over ten tons) demanded continuous energy expenditure—explaining why flying vessels were so prized in the cultivation world.

An idea struck him—he activated the banner's "Illusory Cloud" function. The banner transformed into a thirty-meter-long cloud (albeit an oddly noodle-shaped one) that floated effortlessly upward. 

As they ascended to a thousand meters, his pale-faced subordinates clung desperately to the narrow cloud, terrified of falling into the sea below. None dared suggest widening the cloud or adding railings—their fear of their "unpredictable" leader outweighed their fear of heights.

During the ten-day journey, Lin Shan noticed half the other Foundation Establishment teams lacked proper flying vessels too, making him appreciate his banner's versatility. When they finally reached the Ainu Sea's central island, his trembling subordinates disembarked, having endured what they assumed was their leader's deliberate hazing.

The Ainu Island, named for the sea it anchored, spanned a hundred li with sparse arable land. Its ten thousand inhabitants survived through fishing, having developed a simple village lifestyle. As Lin Shan's group descended, the villagers prostrated themselves, shouting "Immortal Masters!"—a testament to previous cultivators' displays of power.

After summoning the village elders, Lin Shan bluntly announced that all islands in the area now belonged to the Black Lotus Sect, requiring every household to worship their Buddha statues sincerely. The bewildered elders—mostly illiterate fishermen—had no idea how to implement this.

Salvation came from an unexpected quarter—a late-stage Qi Refining elder among Lin Shan's subordinates named Zhong. This wizened man with a goatee (vaguely resembling someone Lin Shan once knew) stepped forward with prepared materials.

Producing a Black Lotus statue, Zhong launched into an elaborate performance: recounting the Buddha's mortal origins as a compassionate prince, his enlightenment under a black lotus, and the sect's founding. Simultaneously, he activated an array of effects—hypnotic incense, soul-calming pills, a wooden fish percussion instrument, glowing robes, and levitation talismans—transforming himself into a radiant, floating preacher.

The combined sensory bombardment left even Lin Shan slightly dizzy. The villagers fell into a trance, chanting along as Zhong's voice boomed with supernatural resonance. Objects levitated around them as the entire courtyard filled with solemn Buddhist light.

"Across the sea of suffering, the shore awaits."
"Without purging lust, dust cannot be cleared."
"Drop your blade, and become Buddha now."

By the time Zhong concluded with a thunderous "Amitabha!" the converted elders were rushing into the streets to proclaim the Black Lotus Buddha's glory, leaving Lin Shan and his stunned cultivators behind in the courtyard.
