# Chapter 255: The Tree of Fate, He Is Not Here (1/2)

Although the area was called the Azure Luan Clan Territory, there was only one true pure-blooded Azure Luan: the clan’s Old Matriarch.

Legend had it that she was once one of the Great Shang Dynasty’s auspicious divine birds, bearing the dynasty’s fortune and suppressing the Southern Border.

Though she no longer carried the dynasty’s fortune, she still retained the surname bestowed upon her by the Great Shang.

Inside the ancient tree at the very center of the territory.

Shang Qinqing appeared to be a woman no older than thirty, dressed in a skirt that seemed out of this era, exuding a profound and tranquil aura.

At that moment, she was playing the zither with her bare hands. As the flowing, water-like melody drifted forth, many strange birds and flying beasts danced with joy.

Suddenly, the zither music stopped.

"Before an Azure Luan meets their fated person, they cannot speak."

"That is why most of us are well-versed in the art of music, to express what lies in our hearts."

Shang Qinqing raised her head with a smile, looking at the young girl listening to the music not far away.

"If you aren't versed in music, you might slip up when competing for the Divine Jade of the Heavens."

"What song was that just now?" Ying Bing’s eyes shifted slightly as she watched a butterfly fluttering nearby before retracting her gaze.

"Phoenix Courting the Phoenix." Shang Qinqing propped her chin up and smiled. "I wonder what kind of person this 'Lucky Star Husband' is, to make someone like you, with the Ten Forbidden Body and the ability to observe the forms of a hundred birds, fall for him."

"And what makes you say that?"

Ying Bing lowered her eyes, extending her hand to let the butterfly rest on her fingertip.

Shang Qinqing said seriously, "So it was just a rumor spreading outside? Then I should teach him a lesson to save you from the gossip."

"No!"

Ying Bing wasn't smiling anymore.

The butterfly was so startled it flew away from her finger.

"You're soft-hearted~" Shang Qinqing laughed happily.

Ying Bing’s gaze paused for a moment before she lowered her eyes and said, "I thought the Azure Luan clan was known for being taciturn?"

"That's right. It's precisely because we couldn't speak in the past that we talk as much as we can now that we can."

Shang Qinqing asked with great interest, "Why didn't you bring him to the Southern Border? He’s a Lucky Star, after all. If he came, it might be much easier for you to obtain the Divine Jade of the Heavens."

"He..."

Ying Bing had actually considered it.

Her rapid progress in this life was inseparable from him.

But... after all, he wasn't like her, who could observe the forms of a hundred birds and possessed the Taiyin Moon Phoenix Body. With Shang Qinqing’s help, she was no different from a true pure-blooded Azure Luan.

The demon clans would never tolerate a human taking away the Jade Phoenix God.

Because the Jade Phoenix God could purify the bloodline of the demon race and also contained part of the memories of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix.

Shang Qinqing suddenly narrowed her eyes and said, "You're afraid he'll be in danger, but you're also afraid you're too dependent on him?"

"No..."

Afraid?

This unfamiliar word seemed to have never appeared in her dictionary.

She hadn't even feared the path to immortality...

"Here."

Suddenly, Shang Qinqing handed out a mooncake.

It was the lotus paste mooncake shaped like the Q-version of Little Li.

"How do you still have one?"

"I asked you for it last time. I had a feeling you'd regret it."

Ying Bing pursed her lips and took a small bite of the mooncake.

It was the familiar 'taste'.

The taste she used to be able to taste every day...

"Oh, oh, oh, I really caught you red-handed."

Shang Qinqing had a look of a mother watching her daughter-in-law, hugging her zither and rolling around on the ground.

"..."

Ying Bing wrapped up the rest of the mooncake and said in a clear, crisp voice, "Let's talk about the Divine Jade of the Heavens instead."

"You... wait a moment for me..."

It took a while for Shang Qinqing to recover.

She sat up straight and said, "The Divine Jade appears once every sixty years, staying for seven years each time. After seven years, it returns to the heavens and won't fall back to the Floating Monastery until the next sixty-year cycle for the various clans to compete for."

"It's probably because a great era is coming; the geniuses of the various clans this time are far superior to the past."

"The strongest ones include the Great Peng Clan, the Golden-Furred Howler Clan, the Qiongqi Clan..."

---

If the Jade Phoenix God didn't automatically disappear after appearing for seven years each time, it probably wouldn't be up to the young talents of the various clans to fight over it; the strong experts of the clans would have already started a great war.

But if they fought to the death every sixty years, the Southern Border would be barren before long.

Shang Qinqing was speaking well at first, but somehow, the topic drifted again.

"No clan has ever truly possessed the Divine Jade of the Heavens. I think it's because it hasn't met its true master yet."

"Your talent is unparalleled throughout history. If you had your Lucky Star Husband assisting you, there's a real chance..."

"By the way, there's a神奇 (divine/magical) Tree of Fate in the Floating Ancient Monastery. I heard it's incredibly effective."

Her gaze suddenly became distant, as if she had returned to her youth.

"You're an Azure Luan, why don't you believe in yourself?" Ying Bing didn't quite understand her train of thought.

An Azure Luan can only speak after meeting their fated partner.

So, to this day, they are still regarded by many as a symbol of love.

"Who says I don't believe? I bow to the mirror three times every morning when I wake up," Shang Qinqing said with a smile.

Then she saw Ying Bing ponder for a moment, clasp her hands together, and bow to her three times.

Her gentle and jade-like face carried a hint of seriousness.

"?"

Shang Qinqing was momentarily choked.

This girl wasn't just cold on the outside; she was also very proud. When they first met, Shang Qinqing had put on the air of a senior, but Ying Bing stood there gracefully, unmoved, and it was actually Shang Qinqing who lost her composure first.

"The two of you bowing together makes it more effective~"

"......That tree."

"Same thing."

Shang Qinqing said half-jokingly, but the truth was she hadn't gotten to witness the scene properly and wasn't satisfied yet.

"..."

The ice lump rubbed the big-headed doll's head for a long time without speaking, her lips lightly pressed together.

He wasn't here.

Forget it... it was a good thing he wasn't here; that was what she had hoped for after all...

"You don't talk much to begin with, which fits the characteristics of the Azure Luan clan."

"As for music... I'll teach you."

Shang Qinqing smiled.

Fate is the most mysterious thing in the world, and love is full of unexpected twists.

Who knows if the person who shouldn't be here will suddenly appear?

...

"Achoo!"

High in the sky, a bald Great Peng flew across the horizon.

Li Mo rubbed his nose and couldn't help but mutter to himself.

*Wait, I'm at the Divine Observation Realm now, my physical body is even stronger than a demon beast, how can I still catch a cold?*

It wasn't exactly a cold, he just kept sneezing.

Murong Xiao said solemnly, "Brother Li, when you transform into a鸣蛟 (Ming Jiao/Dragon) body in the future, you must not sneeze casually."

"Why?"

Li Mo was不解 (puzzled). Was it because demon beasts don't get sick?

"I heard that an ancestor of the Ming Jiao clan once sneezed carelessly, which caused a torrential rain and led to a flood."

Murong Xiao spoke with a bit of a lisp.

"Later, he was hunted down by the Divine Sword of the Tianshan Sword Manor, chased all the way to the Southern Border before it stopped. He still doesn't dare to go out and walk around now."

"..."

Li Mo thought to himself, *is the Ming Jiao clan's reputation as a disaster beast derived from this? Because they sneeze too much, they became synonymous with floods.*

"Exactly! When Ming Jiaos sneeze, it's easy for it to rain. It's so annoying!"

The Peng demon's voice was very small, filled with heavy resentment.

"......So that's how your blood feud started."

Ever since they learned that Ying Bing had gone to the Azure Luan Clan Territory, five days had passed. They had been riding the Peng demon, flying towards the Ming Jiao Clan Territory all this time.

Now, looking out, there were more and more swamps.

They were almost there.
