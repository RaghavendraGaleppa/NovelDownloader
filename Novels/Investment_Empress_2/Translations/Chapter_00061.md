# Chapter 61: My Title Is Primordial Heaven Sovereign!

The noon sun hung high in the sky.

The carriage headed towards Qingyuan Mountain against the sunlight. The buildings atop the main peak were already faintly visible, their unique layout standing out vividly against the green mountains. It was unclear which great master had designed them.

However.

Li Mo looked at the mountain scenery, and the scene from earlier involuntarily surfaced in his mind.

Half an hour ago.

The little beggar removed the cloth strip binding her eyes. Beneath it were clear, gray-white pupils, possessing a purity and innocence untouched by the world, reminiscent of a baby's eyes.

Yet they also carried a hint of timidity and inferiority, not daring to meet anyone's gaze.

How could someone truly have eyes of this color?

Li Mo was reminiscing about a certain ninja anime when a pale little face suddenly appeared in his vision.

Her hair was still a mess like tangled weeds, and her clothes were extremely tattered, creating a stark contrast with that delicate face.

Li Mo remembered this scene, not merely because of the girl's fourteen-year-old face that could topple cities.

She stood there, her two small hands with nowhere to rest, twisting together in anxiety.

Like a small white flower swaying in the wind, emerging from a desolate ruin...

"The color of her Destiny hasn't changed. She shouldn't be discovered by the Patrol Sky Guards."

"I wonder how long it will take her to discover the special nature of the Ancient Meaning Ring?"

Li Mo's thoughts churned.

Suddenly, he slapped his thigh.

"What's wrong, Brother Li?"

Mu Rongxiao, who was dozing off beside him, raised his head, his sleepy features scrunching up together.

"It's bad!"

"I forgot to tell her that she needs to drip blood onto the ring to bond with it!"

Young Li felt immense regret.

To make it more realistic, he had used a classic trope from the novels of his previous life when making the ring.

That ring needed to remember the user's aura through blood.

But when he left.

The moment he saw that girl's face, he forgot all about it!

...

That night.

Smoke rose from the stoves in Mud Corner Alley.

The physically disabled little beggars were all busy, tidying up the dilapidated small courtyard.

Previously, this was their temporary shelter, but now it was different. Brother Li said that from now on, this was their home.

A home... should naturally be kept clean, right?

"Sister Stutter has been spacing out all day."

"Hehe, is she thinking about Brother Li?"

"Now that you mention it, I miss him too. His cooking was the best."

"Later, I'm also going to Qingyuan Sect, that way I can see him every day."

"Abababa!"

"Sister Stutter, even if you wipe the ring cleaner, Brother Li can't see it."

"This doesn't seem to be a gift from Brother Li, though."

...

Jiang Chulong sat hugging her knees, carefully wiping the exquisite ring on her index finger, afraid of getting it dirty.

Hearing these words, she froze.

That's right.

Although Brother Li delivered this ring, it was actually prepared by Aunt Mei.

Why would Aunt Mei give her such a ring?

It wasn't a known spatial artifact, nor did it have any other special effects.

"Aunt Mei definitely wouldn't do anything meaningless."

"This ring must be very important."

Jiang Chulong bit her increasingly pale lips, thinking uneasily:

"Did I do something wrong?"

In the past, her world was very colorful.

In her eyes, the world contained more things and spiritual energy than others, as if she could see a color that others couldn't.

However, after her Sword Bone was dug out, that color vanished.

"Am I going to disappoint Aunt Mei?"

"It's all my fault... I'm sorry..."

Jiang Chulong gripped the ring tightly, her knuckles turning white. The stinging pain finally made her feel a little better.

*Drip—*

A crimson drop of blood flowed down from between her fingers.

It also stained the Ancient Meaning Ring with a demonic luster.

---

*Hum...*

At that moment.

She suddenly felt dizzy, and the world before her eyes began to spin like a vortex.

What was happening?

This thought arose in her hazy consciousness.

The voices of the little children echoed in her ears:

"Sister Stutter, what's wrong with you?"

"She's fainted!"

Suddenly.

All the sounds vanished, and a great silence fell.

She朦胧ly opened her eyes, blocking the sudden light, and then saw where she was.

Boundless white mist, as if she was already outside the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths.

This place wasn't large, only about five hundred meters in diameter.

However, the pavilions and towers were scattered in an orderly manner, filled with an artless ingenuity, as if formed by nature. Even when she was in the Central Divine Continent, she had never seen such exquisite buildings.

It was like a fairyland in a dream.

"Where am I?"

Jiang Chulong rubbed her eyes, her face full of confusion.

"Heh..."

Suddenly, a deep, resonant laugh echoed through the heavens and earth.

"Little friend, coming from afar is a guest. Please enter."

"I... me?"

Jiang Chulong carefully stepped over the threshold.

She saw.

In the courtyard, beneath an ancient tree, a figure sat leisurely on a green stone.

He, his white robes as pure as snow, his face covered by a bronze mask.

He, surrounded by countless phenomena and the rhythm of the Dao rising and falling, as if he had been there since the birth of the heavens and earth, watching the mortal world.

He, was the root of this world's existence, capable of changing the wind and clouds with a wave of his hand.

"Elder... where... where is this?"

Jiang Chulong asked cautiously.

"This? This is just a cave dwelling I opened for leisure outside the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths."

The man spoke calmly.

Jiang Chulong: !

Her little mind went blank for a moment.

Outside the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths?

She was now, crossing an unknown distance, appearing outside the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths?

"Hahaha, just a small trick, no need to be alarmed."

"I brought you here, so I can naturally send you back."

The man's ethereal voice came again.

He waved his hand, and a stool appeared out of thin air on the ground. Tea sets appeared on the stone table.

"Sit."

She walked over in a daze and sat down. It was a long while before Jiang Chulong snapped out of it:

"You are... who?"

"Bringing me over... for what... why?"

Getting closer, she felt even more that this Elder was unfathomably mysterious.

Even her cold father, who carried the destiny of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, didn't give her the feeling this mysterious man did.

In the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, there were very few experts of this level.

For her, they should all be well-known names.

"This Sovereign's name..."

The mysterious man opposite fell into thought.

It seemed that because he hadn't been called by name for too long, and had lived through too many years, he had even forgotten his own name.

After a long while, he slowly spoke:

"My title is... Primordial Heaven Sovereign..."

*Crack—*

As the words fell.

Lightning suddenly descended from the sky.

*Rumble—*

The wind and clouds changed color, lightning danced wildly, turning the world pale in an instant.

Jiang Chulong was terrified. She looked up, her heart pounding.

In the world that had turned only black and white, the silhouette of the man grew increasingly distinct.

How vicissitudinal and transcendent he was!
