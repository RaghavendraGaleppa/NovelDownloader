# Chapter 595: Instant Refinement

The moment the Eight-Colored Cloud Qi was released, it surged forward like a tide, instantly wrapping around the flagpole of the Star Spirit Banner suspended above Xu Yunfan's head.

Receiving this infusion of Creation Cloud Qi, the Star Spirit Banner was like a violent catalyst had been injected into it.

*Rumble!*

On the banner's surface, the rotation speed of all the stellar phantoms suddenly increased tenfold.

The silver-white Star Fire Arrow instantly swelled and solidified, its color shifting from silver-white to a blazing white that seemed capable of burning through nothingness itself.

Then, carrying the ultimate aura of burning the heavens and boiling the seas, or extinguishing a world with a meteor, it crashed down upon the arrogant remnant soul at the base of the Five-Finger Cliff as if the firmament itself were collapsing.

*"Graaah!!"*

The trapped remnant soul of the vicious monkey felt a threat of death unlike any it had ever known, and it could not help but let out a mournful roar so fierce it could pierce the clouds and crack stone, shaking the very void.

On the verge of total exhaustion, the demon monkey, in its extreme fury, forcibly erupted with power. Above its charred and broken body, it instantly condensed a Dharma Form of a furious, roaring giant ape, pounding its chest and stamping its feet.

Though the phantom was blurry and its golden eyes were damaged, it still carried an unrivaled will to battle the heavens and the earth, to stand between them.

The Dharma Form slammed its fists into the ground, desperately expending its last remaining origin power to madly claw and bite at the descending, exterminating Star Fire.

*Crack!*

*Boom!*

A grating sound of shattering and a violent energy explosion rang out simultaneously.

The Five-Finger Buddha Seal, formed from the Tathagata's supreme law and lingering for countless years, actually fractured under the impact of these two similarly overbearing and unreasonable forces, cracking like a spider's web.

The light leaking from the cracks was no longer pure Buddhist light, but rather a violent surge of demonic energy and a cold torrent of Star Fire.

Xu Yunfan's face showed a trace of awe. He truly hadn't expected the先天生灵 (xian tian sheng ling) of this celestial realm to be so profound, not inferior to the先天道台生灵 (xian tian dao tai sheng ling) of the Taihua Lingxu Realm.

It seemed this monkey must have been formed from the very essence and energy of this realm's Heavenly Lord.

Though these thoughts flashed through his mind, Xu Yunfan's incantations did not cease. His Dantian was like a furnace connecting heaven and earth, with the Eight-Scene Cloud Qi surging out endlessly.

This cloud qi was formless and intangible, yet it could refine artifacts and enhance treasures, making it naturally incredibly wondrous.

Where the blazing white Star Fire and the giant ape's Dharma Form collided, it was like pouring cold water into a seething cauldron of hot oil.

The tenacious, dark-gold demonic energy of the giant ape's phantom, under the焚烧 (fén shāo) of the Star Fire containing the power to refine the heavens, melted and evaporated with incredible speed, like snow melting on a hot day.

Where the Star Fire passed, the phantom disintegrated inch by inch.

Like snow under the sun.

*"That old Tathagata suppressed me for five hundred years, yet he couldn't break my will."*

Sensing the starlight absorbed by the Star Spirit Banner was impossible to resist, the vicious monkey's will let out a final, unwilling cry as it rapidly perished.

*"You, this evil heretic, also want to... Pfft...!!"*

*"Get in here!"*

Xu Yunfan's hair and beard bristled, the light in his eyes flared, and he exerted his full force in a pull.

The remnant soul of the vicious monkey, having lost its final resistance, was instantly swept up by the silver-white Star Fire and completely submerged within the Star Spirit Banner.

*Hmmmm!!*

The Star Spirit Banner erupted with an unprecedented, violent tremor.

The flagpole shook violently, as if it might explode at any moment.

The stellar river space inside the banner, which had gradually stabilized after absorbing the three Star Spirits of Yang Jian, Nezha, and Taiyi, was now like a volcano made of a billion stars had been thrown into it.

The entire miniature world within the banner churned violently.

Starlight phantoms, long since solidified by the power of the celestial bodies, were violently knocked off their orbits by the surging, indomitable will and residual divine power.

The phantom of Yang Jian's Star Lord paled, violently thrown back by a tremendous force, his surrounding starlight flickering unsteadily.

Nezha's red battle soul flickered like a candle in the wind, on the verge of dispersing.

The remnant soul of Taiyi Zhenren was directly overturned and swept away, vanishing into the violent energy turbulence.

The auras of the three Star Spirits became incredibly unstable under the冲击 (chōng jī) of Sun Wukong's fierce soul. Their light and shadows swayed violently, and the entire Star Spirit Space fell into unprecedented chaos and turmoil.

*"What a tyrannical monkey."*

Even after entering the banner, it was still so mischievous.

A hint of solemnity finally appeared on Xu Yunfan's face.

He knew well that the strength of the other's spiritual soul and will was unprecedented, a convergence of the Heavenly Lord's essence. If he couldn't suppress it in an instant, it might damage the foundation of the Star Spirit Banner itself.

*"Taiyi Clear Source Demon-Cleansing!"* Not daring to be negligent, he brought the index and middle fingers of his right hand together. At his fingertips, a condensed essence of clear light instantly gathered, infused with the Thunder of the Divine Sky, tracing mysterious trajectories in the air and leaving behind indelible talisman marks.

In the blink of an eye, thirty-six talisman seals, radiating with clear light and containing the power to镇压 (zhèn yā) the soul with the Great Dao, were rapidly drawn.

He flicked his fingers continuously. These thirty-six talisman seals, like thirty-six heavy ancient stars, roared as they layered upon one another. Carrying the power to stabilize space-time and suppress all evil, they slammed fiercely onto the violently trembling surface of the Star Spirit Banner.

With each talisman seal that landed, the banner's trembling weakened by a fraction, as if being pinned down by massive, reinforcing nails.

Simultaneously, the incantation in his left hand changed again.

The Eight-Scene Cloud Qi hovering above the banner no longer dispersed to provide amplification, but instead, like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, it rapidly retracted and condensed.

The cloud qi churned, and a seven-colored light flowed within it, transforming in an instant into a slowly rotating seven-colored treasure lotus.

The treasure lotus turned slowly. Each petal shed countless rays of light, like the Milky Way hanging upside down, strand by strand. Gently yet irresistibly, it enveloped the violently churning space within the banner below.

It was like pouring nine heavens' pure ice onto a volcano on the verge of eruption.

Under the suppression of the treasure lotus, the uncontrolled chaos and violence within the Star Spirit Space were forcibly held down by an invisible hand.

The agitation began to subside, and the orbits of the stars were gradually corrected and restored.

Only the monkey's golden soul remained, like a drop of water in boiling oil, frantically charging and roaring within the chaotic light. Each collision unleashed brilliant, dazzling fragments of golden light. Occasionally, smaller stellar phantoms were knocked askew, their light dimming as they drifted away.

*"Struggle well. The more you struggle, the more excited I become!"*

Zhang Ziyang, who was silently watching from the side and ready to act at any moment, heard Xu Yunfan's words and his face filled with speechlessness.

*"...*

Xu Yunfan opened his mouth and exhaled. A thread of his own origin essence, pure and refined, carrying wisps of purple light, was spat out with a *puff* onto the seven-colored treasure lotus.

Nourished by the origin essence, the seven-colored treasure lotus shone with brilliant light.

The color of the Eight-Scene Cloud Qi instantly became deeper and more reserved.

An invisible power instantly permeated the entire space within the banner. The flow of time within the space itself was forcibly distorted by the power of this lotus.

A moment outside was a day, two days, or three days inside.

The monkey's indomitable golden soul rolled and charged within, causing the light to ripple like water.

But with each collision, wisps of light would cling to it like maggots in bone, branding it with the purple qi of the Star Spirit Banner and the unique refining and remolding power of the Eight-Scene Cloud Qi.

The demon monkey's golden eyes were still furious like fire, but the edges of the flames were beginning to quietly be tinged with a cold, stardust-like hue.
