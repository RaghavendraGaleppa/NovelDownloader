Chapter 190: Trial Sword Under Heaven

Under the cover of night, the chirping of insects was like delicate threads, a small pebble path winding through the quiet woods. In the distance, a few difficult streaks of crimson light squeezed through the gaps in the dense foliage, resembling scattered gold shimmering in the darkness.

Qin Ming had seen them before: the purple-eyed crow was Master Wu, and the woman in black was Tang Jin, from Flowing Light City, who had once sought the most suitable successor for her master.

According to Yuque, Tang Jin hadn't thought much of Qin Ming back then, not believing he could become her master's final disciple.

Qin Ming was also familiar with the young man beside Tang Jin, as this person frequently appeared in the Night Report, and though not yet a household name, he was quite famous.

His name was Ling Yu. Dressed in green robes, with black hair falling past his shoulders, his eyes were deep, conveying a contained heroism amidst his composure. His body contained an incredibly vibrant life force.

Recently, he had conducted his "Trial Sword Across a Hundred Cities," causing a great sensation and earning him the moniker "Young Ancestor" from some.

Qin Ming was slightly surprised to encounter them here, but not entirely, as Ling Yu was soon to face Xin Youdao in a duel.

The latter was also a formidable individual, once having swept through eighty-one cities, a prominent figure in the Night Report, and one of the most renowned prodigies in this year's unified examination.

Tang Jin possessed a slender figure. Though her true face was not revealed, when the night wind rustled the leaves, even her loose black robes struggled to conceal the beauty of her curves.

Qin Ming glanced at her, walking past without a word. There was no possibility of acknowledging each other; though they had met, there was no real relationship between them.

Wu Yaozu, however, took two good looks at her, thinking his grandmother was right: the outside world was indeed vibrant and colorful, even this quiet forest was splendid.

After they brushed past, Tang Jin sensed something, turning to look at the back of one of the youths.

Back then, when competing for the mysterious resources within the special node at Black-White Mountain, she had dared to single-handedly pursue and kill the green-robed woman who had gained the greatest fortune. Naturally, she possessed extraordinary abilities.

“Found nothing!” Master Wu flew back, then, filled with doubt, also looked at Qin Ming’s receding figure.

“Looks familiar, isn’t this the youth we missed back then?” It possessed mysterious purple pupils, capable of seeing partial truths others couldn't.

“Who? Is he very strong?” the young Ling Yu asked.

The purple-eyed crow nodded, carefully observing the receding figures, and said, “Hmm, personally, I think one of the youths is quite extraordinary; he manifested unusual phenomena during his initial rebirth. Oh, the other kid also seems rather uncommon. Interesting, that two such individuals could end up together.”

After they had walked quite a distance, Wu Yaozu whispered, “Bro, I feel like that woman just now was looking at me.”

“Remember, at a time like this, don’t trust your feelings,” Qin Ming said, stopping to look at the important letter he had tucked into his sleeve.

Wu Yaozu said, “Really? Oh, and that black crow was looking at you.”

Qin Ming ignored him, looking at the brief message on the letter, his heart suddenly surging with emotion.

Lu Zizai’s message was just a simple sentence: “Strive with all your might for the Auspicious Beast Blood, and your fairness will be guaranteed.”

Qin Ming had originally given up on the Auspicious Beast Blood because he knew too many people and interests were involved, making it a far-reaching matter.

Why were Cui Chonghe, Sun Jingxiao, and others present in Kunling?

Moreover, the several Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds Qin Ming had encountered while on the Vermilion Bird airship were not merely there to gather Nine Heavens Essence from that 'land' in the sky, but had also come for the Auspicious Beast Blood.

Qin Ming struggled to contain his surging emotions. He knew that Lu Zizai himself was under immense pressure; for instance, Sun Taichu had intended to act against him today.

Under such circumstances, Lu Zizai had still given him a promise, telling him to go all out, while Lu Zizai himself was facing an unknown and harsh environment!

Such a favor was indeed quite weighty.

“Bro, what’s wrong?” Wu Yaozu asked.

“The Auspicious Beast Blood, we’re going for it!” Qin Ming declared, turning back to carefully study the rules.

In any case, if fair competition was truly guaranteed, how could he not have a share in the domain of the Rebirth Path?

Just then, a small golden bird flew over, landing on a branch close to Qin Ming, its eyes gleaming.

“Senior!” Qin Ming quickly greeted it in a low voice.

The small golden bird sighed lightly, saying, “He values you greatly. In his eyes, on this Path of Rebirth, at most four people can forge the way forward in the future, including him and you.”

Qin Ming’s blood gradually boiled. He was only at the first realm, yet Lu Zizai thought so highly of him.

He felt an urge to shout out loud that he would surely forge the way forward in the future!

But he restrained himself. He was merely a nascent cultivator; discussing the future was too far off. For now, it was better to be down-to-earth and repay Lu Zizai with practical actions.

Qin Ming felt some concern for Lu Zizai. What he had seen today, that white-haired body, actually carried a heavy aura of decay.

“How is Senior Brother Lu?” he asked in a low voice.

The small golden bird secretly transmitted a message: “He is fine. The golden giant you saw today was formed from his past cultivation, not his true state. It was his ‘attainment’ that he is striving to forget.”

Although Qin Ming had his suspicions, being confirmed still deeply moved him. How many could bear to give up such 'attainment'? Lu Zizai was truly far beyond what ordinary people could achieve!

The small golden bird continued, “Rest assured, when he completely forgets the past one day, and a ‘new attainment’ emerges, he will become even stronger, rooted in his past cultivation, truly 'reborn'!”

“Good!” Qin Ming nodded. He believed that as long as Lu Zizai didn't die, he would one day far surpass his former self.

The small golden bird spread its wings and flew far away, vanishing into the vast night.

Wu Yaozu wiped the sweat from his forehead, letting out a long breath, and said, “Why do I feel like it’s more dangerous outside than in the Fourth Forbidden Zone? Just a small bird, yet it made my soul tremble, as if I were facing a monstrous anomaly as massive as a mountain!”

Qin Ming said, “Its true form might not be any smaller than a mountain!”

The forest was rather dim. There was a large cluster of wooden houses here, where many nascent cultivators resided.

Today, the place was filled with dejection and unease. Many were sitting in silent meditation, pondering their future paths. This was because not long ago, the Grandmaster of the Path of Rebirth had appeared at the Flying Immortal Academy, clearly exuding an aura of decay, making people feel that there was no hope to be seen on this path.

“On the Path of Rebirth, no Grandmaster has forged the way forward for many years, while other paths are still being opened, sigh!”

“No wonder there were rumors that someone once wanted the Grandmaster of the Path of Rebirth to serve as a mere laborer; it wasn’t baseless after all.”

“Alas, we tried other paths, but couldn’t walk them at all. Without special innate talents, we are just ordinary people; only the path of bodily mutation is feasible.”

A group of people sighed, feeling that this night, like their path ahead, was particularly dim, with no scenery visible in front of them.

“Oh, that’s right, tomorrow evening, Ling Yu, who ‘Trial Sword Across a Hundred Cities,’ will duel Xin Youdao right here at our academy! They count as people of the Rebirth Path, don’t they? I’m looking forward to it!”

The next day, after Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu got up, they continued to familiarize themselves with the environment of Mountain River Academy. Their assessment of the dining hall was four words: "Terrible, and insanely expensive!"

“Bro, that’s the Library you’ve been thinking about! It’s quite grand and magnificent, nine stories tall.”

Soon, they learned that to read the classics, one either needed contribution points or had to pay to read.

After Wu Yaozu inquired, he gasped, inhaling the crimson light in front of the building, and said, “Hiss, so expensive! Bro, if this doesn’t work, we really have to fight a round. We both lack ‘Daylight Gold’ among the Five Elements!”

Qin Ming nodded. They couldn’t let 'a bit' of Daylight Gold block their path and stump heroes.

Before noon, Mountain River Academy was already bustling, with people continuously entering.

This was because the news of Ling Yu’s ‘Trial Sword Across a Hundred Cities’ and his duel with Xin Youdao had spread days ago, and many people had been eagerly anticipating it.

The fact that tickets for spectator seats had been inflated to exorbitant prices showed that considerable interests were involved, and naturally, people were fanning the flames.

In fact, both Ling Yu and Xin Youdao were indeed heaven-blessed prodigies, astonishing this generation. The title of ‘Young Ancestor’ had even been called out, and they frequently appeared in the Night Report, gaining renown in various regions.

Not only from Kunling, but some had traveled thousands of miles from other cities to attend.

“Ling Yu’s master is the person most likely to become a Grandmaster in this era, a legendary figure, a truly renowned grand individual in the Night Mist World.”

Precisely because of this, people were even more interested, wanting to witness firsthand what kind of person the closed-door disciple personally taught by that Grandmaster truly was.

On that day, the entire city of Kunling was discussing this matter.

This was unlike Sun Taichu’s sudden, unannounced arrival; this battle between young prodigies had been hyped for a long time.

Even without tickets, students from over a dozen other Daoist centers and academies had flocked there, and naturally, there were many senior figures among them.

“Our Path of Rebirth cultivators dueling actually has so much prestige now? People from the Immortal Path, Esoteric Sect Path, and Aberrant Path have all come to watch!”

“Wake up! You nascent cultivators are just flattering yourselves, insisting on interpreting it that way. Do you know that Xin Youdao cultivates two paths simultaneously? His Esoteric Sect methods are even stronger!”

“As for Ling Yu, his master was originally an extraordinary individual. He combined with the Path of Rebirth to advance further, standing at the pinnacle of power, becoming a Grandmaster was merely a natural progression.”

These words directly silenced many nascent cultivators.

Mountain River Academy was bustling with people, unprecedentedly lively.

The front page of the Night Report was actively following the matter; headlines like 'Young Grandmaster Trials Sword Under Heaven' had already been pre-written!

Wu Yaozu’s eyes shone with excitement. “Bro, I think we two could each take one of them and replace them, no problem!”

Though he came from a Forbidden Zone, he was still young. Seeing such a grand spectacle, overwhelming reports, and so many people rushing to watch, he naturally felt unconvinced and quite youthful in his spirit, wishing he could fight those two himself.

Qin Ming smiled and said, “Don’t rush. There will always be opportunities for you to show your prowess in the future. Sooner or later, you will become famous throughout the world.”

The two chatted and laughed, not caring much. What if others overheard? At most, they'd consider it bragging.

“Quite a big talk,” someone indeed sneered upon hearing, thinking these two were insane and too desperate for fame.

However, some beings took them seriously!

In the distance, the purple-eyed crow stood on a treetop, whispering, “Tang Jin, did you hear that? Did you see it? How confident those two youths’ eyes and expressions are. I recognized that little fellow from Black-White Mountain yesterday, and he recognized us too. He clearly doesn’t even put the person you chose in his eyes.”

Tang Jin smiled faintly, saying nothing.

The purple-eyed crow said, “Why don’t you arrange for Ling Yu to gauge him, to see if you misjudged him back at Black-White Mountain?”

“Alright!” Tang Jin’s reply was concise, just two words.
