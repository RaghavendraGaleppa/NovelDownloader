# Chapter 195: Trading Divine Abilities

Lin Shan slowly withdrew from his cultivation state, opening his eyes to feel the surging spiritual power within him. With a resigned sigh, he tossed aside the last gourd containing spirit liquid—the last of the resources he had gathered from the "Spiritual Tide" at the Gongsun Family was now completely exhausted.

Glancing out the window at Black Skeleton Demon Lord peering inside, he casually retrieved the Void Star Disk that had been maintaining the Starlight Formation. The skeletal figure outside watched enviously, its jaw hanging open as if drooling were possible.

"Creak—"

Pushing open the door to his cultivation chamber, Lin Shan stepped out to find Black Skeleton Demon Lord approaching in the courtyard.

A full decade had passed. Aside from summoning the mermaid girl once a month, Lin Shan had left everything else to the skeleton, having no idea how its business ventures were progressing.

Black Skeleton Demon Lord gave him a rundown of costs, operations, sales, services, rent, profits, and various relationship maintenance expenses. While they had earned quite a few spirit stones, most had been reinvested to expand operations, leaving little cash flow.

Lin Shan wasn't overly concerned about these details. What he cared about was whether they had secured access to the "High-End Trading Conference."

As it turned out, the skeleton was indeed a capable individual, having managed to secure the qualification in just ten years. The effort required to establish a fledgling merchant association founded by outsiders in this immortal city and achieve notable success was no small feat.

With a flourish, Black Skeleton Demon Lord produced a square token inscribed with two ancient characters: "Moonview."

"This is the exclusive token for Moonview City's High-End Trading Conference. Simply expanding our business wasn't enough—I had to grease quite a few palms among the higher-ups before finally obtaining this."

Taking the token, Lin Shan examined it through his enhancement interface and discovered it was a magical artifact with unique crafting techniques, capable of verifying identity and opening specific portals.

"With this token, you gain unimpeded access to the High-End Trading Conference as a VIP guest," Black Skeleton Demon Lord explained while rubbing its bony hands together eagerly, its expression making Lin Shan wary.

"The conference will undoubtedly have the cultivation pills you'll need for the late Foundation Establishment stage, even breakthrough pills like the Purple Heart Elixir! Brother, I've spent ten years working tirelessly to secure this qualification—all for your sake!"

Lin Shan was genuinely moved. Obtaining such access was clearly no easy task, and the skeleton had indeed put in considerable effort. But was it truly so devoted to his welfare?

In the next moment, Black Skeleton Demon Lord added, "Also, the Demon Taro Fruit I need to restore my Golden Core cultivation can only be found at high-end trading conferences."

Ah, so this was its real motive all along—it had pushed him to start the merchant association with this very goal in mind.

Half a month later, Moonview City.

Lin Shan walked alone through the streets, draped in a gray robe and hood—a set of magical artifacts similar to what Black Skeleton Demon Lord wore. Unwilling to share with the skeleton, he had commissioned his own set, which concealed his appearance and cultivation level, making it ideal for events like trading conferences where discretion was paramount.

Arriving at a large pavilion in the northern part of the city, he presented his Moonview Token to the guards and was swiftly admitted inside.

Guided by an attendant, he ascended to the second-floor hall, where rows of tables and chairs were neatly arranged. Over a hundred cultivators were already seated, most concealing their cultivation levels and appearances. Only a few, confident in their formidable strength, made no such effort—these were likely Golden Core experts of considerable prowess.

Lin Shan quietly took a seat in a corner, waiting for the conference to begin. More attendees trickled in—some alone, others in small groups.

Half an hour later, an elderly host appeared and announced the start of the event. Each participant was given a mirror-like disc-shaped artifact.

"Esteemed guests, you have each received a trading artifact. For those unfamiliar with its functions, allow me to briefly explain."

Most attendees were already accustomed to this routine introduction, meant to help newcomers acclimate. They paid little attention, instead fiddling with their mirror artifacts.

Lin Shan, unfamiliar with the process, listened carefully as the host continued.

"To ensure privacy and facilitate communication, we've specially crafted these trading artifacts. Activate yours using the corresponding method, input the items you wish to trade, and others will be able to view your offerings. If someone has a matching item, they can initiate a private discussion through the artifact. Once an agreement is reached, parties may proceed to the private booths around the hall for the exchange."

After this explanation, Lin Shan grasped the artifact's purpose: it functioned like a localized network, creating a shared inventory for browsing, with both group and private chat features. The mirrors were interconnected through unique crafting techniques, forming a communication system.

This hybrid online-offline trading method effectively protected participants' privacy, offering greater security than traditional auctions. It showcased the innovative spirit of the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world—perhaps not surpassing the Great Song Dynasty in overall craftsmanship, but certainly more inventive, having even developed a "cultivation chat group," albeit limited to the conference hall.

Following the instructions, Lin Shan activated his mirror under the alias "Mountain Bear Sage" and listed three items: Illusion Spirit Wood, Illusion Spirit Liquid, and the minor divine ability "Water Veil of Heaven."

These were the most valuable items he could offer at such a high-level event. Attendees were either Golden Core experts, representatives of major factions, or self-made powerhouses—all with discerning tastes.

The Illusion Spirit Wood and Liquid were fourth-tier materials harvested from an ancient Illusion Spirit Tree, while "Water Veil of Heaven" was an inheritance from the East Sea's Turtle Sage. Since he had no use for the water-based ability, trading it for a wind-based minor divine ability would be ideal.

His mirror soon displayed a rotating stream of light, presenting rows of glowing orbs representing various items: magical treasures, pills, natural treasures, spirit beasts, cultivation manuals, and more—including his own offerings.

Within moments, he spotted "Foundation Establishment Pills" in the third row and tapped the orb. A chat window popped up.

[Mountain Bear Sage: Fellow Daoist, how do you wish to trade the Foundation Establishment Pills?]

A reply soon followed:

[Old Angler: Which kind? I have Crimson Robe Pills, Azure Fall Pills, Morning Cloud Pills, and others.]

[Mountain Bear Sage: I'm not picky—I'll take them all.]

[Old Angler: One Foundation Establishment pill recipe for five bottles, or one Golden Core recipe for fifty.]

[Mountain Bear Sage: Anything besides recipes? Can we trade for spirit stones?]

[Old Angler: I only want recipes.]

End of conversation. This person was clearly a pill-refining specialist with a singular goal, so Lin Shan moved on.

Browsing further, he found "Demon Taro Fruit" around the tenth row and initiated another chat.

[Mountain Bear Sage: How to trade for the Demon Taro Fruit?]

The response was straightforward:

[Confucian Eternal: Demonic treasure, Mixed Blood Ganoderma, or a blood-path minor divine ability.]

Demonic treasures were artifacts attuned to demonic cultivation, while the other two items were blood-path related. Lin Shan suspected this "Confucian" alias concealed a demonic cultivator—likely a survivor from one of the three destroyed demonic sects, possibly even a Blood River Hall elder.

Again, lacking the requested items, Lin Shan couldn't proceed.

Next, he perused the techniques and divine abilities. The variety of high-level methods dazzled him, but minor divine abilities numbered only about twenty, most provided by the conference's organizers as display pieces rather than serious offerings.

Minor divine abilities were no common commodity—major factions guarded them jealously as secret legacies, while smaller sects considered obtaining even one a monumental achievement. The Golden Core cultivators present might possess such abilities but wouldn't trade their factions' secrets, only extras acquired through personal机缘 (fortuitous encounters).

That the conference organizers could display over a dozen minor divine abilities spoke volumes about their backing—likely a top-tier sect or aristocratic family with vast reserves.

Lin Shan marveled at the display. As a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, he'd rarely glimpsed such techniques, and now he faced an array of options: Meteor Fire Rain, Earth Dragon's Upheaval, Gentle Water Palm, Golden Wood Seal, Merciful Dharma Rain, Great Geng Sword Array, Violet Silk True Fire, Extreme Cold Ice Flame...

Among them, he found two wind-based minor divine abilities—though both were hybrid types. One combined wind and water ("Dragon's Whirlpool Strike"), the other wind and thunder ("Lightning Tempest").

Lin Shan's heart raced. 

Though not pure wind abilities, the latter was perfect—he possessed thunder spiritual roots and could fully utilize both elements! According to the description, this technique wasn't from the organizers but offered by a participant called "Poetry Immortal," likely acquired during travels and now traded as it was unusable for them.

After some deliberation, Lin Shan opened a chat.

[Mountain Bear Sage: How to trade for "Lightning Tempest"?]

The response was delayed, suggesting the other party was busy with multiple conversations.

[Poetry Immortal: Case by case. Preferably a one-for-one minor divine ability trade, with adjustments for differences.]

[Mountain Bear Sage: I have a water-type minor divine ability, "Water Veil of Heaven."]

[Poetry Immortal: Not bad. We can trade, but a single-element ability for a dual-element one requires additional compensation.]

[Mountain Bear Sage: Single-element abilities have broader appeal and retain value. Dual-element ones like wind-thunder are rare but harder to match with buyers.]

[Poetry Immortal: Yet here you are.]

[Mountain Bear Sage: ???]

...

After prolonged haggling with the shrewd Poetry Immortal, Lin Shan finally reached a deal.

[Mountain Bear Sage: "Water Veil of Heaven" plus three one-foot sections of Illusion Spirit Wood.]

[Poetry Immortal: Acceptable.]

Following two failed attempts, this trade succeeded, and Poetry Immortal invited him to Booth Five for the exchange.

Surveying the hall, Lin Shan saw others engrossed in their mirrors—some hesitant, some delighted, some angrily typing after failed negotiations.

Entering Booth Five, he found a figure in a bamboo hat waiting. Their gender-neutral voice was deliberately obscured.

"Mountain Bear Sage?"

Nodding beneath his hood, Lin Shan produced a jade slip and three branches from his storage bracelet. The hat-wearer set down a weathered blue-gray clamshell.

Inspecting it through his enhancement interface, Lin Shan saw:

[Lightning Tempest]

Quality: Minor Divine Ability

Description: A wind-thunder offensive ability created by Breeze True Monarch after studying the innate abilities of Thunder Clam beasts. Alters local weather to unleash indiscriminate lightning and wind attacks.

Enhancement Cost: 64 points

...

Lin Shan's pulse quickened. 

Minor divine abilities were typically mastered only at the Golden Core stage, with rare geniuses like Purple Mansion Sect's Thunder Rain Child achieving proficiency during Foundation Establishment—though even then, only forming the ability's imprint with casting delays, which was already remarkable.

With his enhancement ability, Lin Shan could first learn the ability's imprint, then enhance it directly into a sect-guarding divine ability's seed—representing full mastery. At Foundation Establishment, instant-casting a sect-guarding ability would make him virtually unrivaled among peers, possibly even capable of challenging higher realms.

As he fantasized, the hat-wearer examined the jade slip and wood, chuckling lightly.

"You've gotten the better end of this deal—a copied ability slip and some materials for my unique technique."

The clamshell contained the ability's true intent, offering deeper, quicker comprehension, while jade slips allowed repeated study and could be resold or preserved as faction legacies. Neither side was clearly disadvantaged.

Dropping the topic, the hat-wearer pointed at the wood. "I'm commissioning an illusion array disk and need a bit more material. Do you have extra? Name your price."

Lin Shan considered. "Do you have Demon Taro Fruit?"

"No."

"Demonic treasures, Mixed Blood Ganoderma, or blood-path abilities?"

Again, no.

"Foundation Establishment pills or breakthrough aids?"

This time, the hat-wearer produced numerous bottles—various Foundation Establishment pills, including Purple Heart Elixirs—evidence of substantial backing.

"These for one section of wood?"

After verifying the pills' authenticity, Lin Shan agreed, estimating they'd suffice for his late-stage cultivation. The hat-wearer proposed exchanging contact information, but Lin Shan refused—revealing his Foundation Establishment status would invite trouble.

Returning to his seat, Lin Shan found a new message from "Scholar Teacher," interested in his Illusion Spirit materials.

[Scholar Teacher: I'll trade for Demon Taro Fruit!]

After some back-and-forth where Scholar Teacher tried to inflate prices, Lin Shan stood firm, eventually forcing the other to concede.

[Mountain Bear Sage: Two sections. Take it or leave it.]

As the conference neared its end, Scholar Teacher relented.

[Scholar Teacher: Fine, two it is.]

With that, Lin Shan secured the Demon Taro Fruit for Black Skeleton Demon Lord, concluding a successful trading session.
