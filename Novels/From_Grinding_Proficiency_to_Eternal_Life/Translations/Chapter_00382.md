# Chapter 382: The Spatial Bag

The strands of Ten Extremes True Qi pierced into Chen Jiuchuan's heart meridian like venomous snakes, multiplying in quantity to dissolve the true essence within his body, instantly stirring up a tempestuous storm within him.

Wherever the true qi passed, his meridians felt as if pierced by ten thousand needles, and his bones emitted cracking sounds as if unable to bear the strain.

Chen Jiuchuan's face twisted instantly, yet he couldn't even let out a scream, because Xu Yunfan's other hand was already gripping his throat.

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly. His fingertips trembled, and the Ten Extremes True Qi spread through Chen Jiuchuan's body like a spiderweb.

He calmed his mind and focused his spirit, carefully perceiving the completely different energy system within this disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Chen Jiuchuan's meridians were like exquisite jade pipes; every meridian radiated the unique dark cyan luster produced by the cultivation method of Baiyue Peak. The true qi, nearly worn away, flowed orderly within them, surging from the Dantian, cycling through the Twelve Principal Meridians, and finally returning to the Eight Extraordinary Meridians. Even more wondrously, there was a miniature mountain shadow suppressing his Qihai point; it must be the secret technique of Baiyue Peak, the "Hundred Mountains Suppressing Demon Seal."

This was completely different from Xu Yunfan's own method of circulating true qi.

His Ten Extremes True Qi did not require meridians at all; instead, it directly permeated every inch of his flesh and blood.

The true qi surged through muscle fibers like rivers, flowed through bone gaps like magma, and could even resonate with the external world through his pores.

Although this cultivation system could push his physical body to the extreme, human strength is ultimately limited. To seek longevity, one must look outward.

"So that's how it is..."

Xu Yunfan realized in his heart.

The reason these disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect could accommodate foreign true essence was precisely due to this precise meridian system filtering and harmonizing it.

Although he had no meridian constraints and could embrace all rivers, he also had to bear the backlash of conflicting true qi. If his physical body weren't strong enough, the vast true qi within him alone would have worn his bones to dust.

After a long time, Xu Yunfan slowly retracted his Ten Extremes True Qi, a trace of surprise flashing in his eyes.

He looked at the pale-faced Chen Jiuchuan, the corner of his mouth curling up. "It's quite strange, you were actually able to hold back and not make a move?"

Chen Jiuchuan forced a smile that was uglier than crying.

Just now, when Xu Yunfan had his eyes closed investigating, his entire body was wide open, with several vital points completely exposed. Such a rare opportunity, how could he not have considered it?

As a disciple of Baiyue Peak in the Primordial Origin Sect, killing people and seizing treasures was already etched into his very bones.

In the past, let alone a sneak attack, wiping out a family was just a snap of the fingers.

But standing next to this monster now, his palms were sweating profusely as he gripped his hands, yet he didn't dare to act.

Chen Jiuchuan squeezed out a smile. "Senior, how would I dare to act? To be favored by you is truly my honor!"

"Good survival instinct. I won't追究 the past, but if you dare to deceive me again, I will kill you. If you die in the Divine Martial Realm, you'll enter the cycle of reincarnation with no chance of rising again."

Chen Jiuchuan felt a chill in his heart and nodded repeatedly, swearing oaths.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but secretly give him a thumbs up. These disciples of the Primordial Origin Demon Sect are all talents. Whether it was You Quan he met earlier or Chen Jiuchuan before him, they were all adept at judging the situation, capable of being tough or soft, arrogant or subservient.

To survive in the Primordial Origin Sect, one must first correct one's attitude. If one offends those disciples close to the Foundation Establishment True Lords, one won't even know how one died.

Chen Jiuchuan said, "Senior, what do you wish to know? I will surely speak without reservation and hold nothing back!"

"First, tell me about your Baiyue Peak's Hundred Mountains Suppressing Demon Scripture."

Xu Yunfan spoke casually, while slowly starting to clean up the battlefield.

This time, the Primordial Origin Sect sent thirty-six disciples into the Divine Martial Realm. Now that he had killed seven, he naturally needed to collect the spoils from these people.

Knowing the Primordial Origin Sect's style, these people basically carried all their possessions with them.

Hearing this, Chen Jiuchuan hurriedly cupped his fists. "Senior, please be enlightened. My Baiyue Peak's 'Hundred Mountains Suppressing Demon Scripture' is divided into nine levels. It emphasizes 'gathering the essence of a hundred mountains to forge true essence, using the earth's veins to nourish the soul'..."

As he spoke, he glanced sideways and saw Xu Yunfan bending down to pick up a broken snake-shaped short sword.

The gray-green blade was still stained with the blood of its original owner.

Xu Yunfan flicked the sword body with his fingertips and shook his head slightly. This item had lost all its spiritual nature and was now just scrap metal; he tossed it aside casually.

He turned and walked toward another person, listening to Chen Jiuchuan's narration all the while.

"The first level requires visualizing the True Form Chart of the Five Peaks, condensing a mountain shadow in the Qihai..."

Amidst the sound of metal hitting the ground, he kicked open the hand of a corpse and took the bronze mirror that was split in two.

The battlefield was a mess.

Various damaged artifacts lay scattered beside the seven corpses.

Black jade prayer beads shattered by the Crimson Fire Dragon-Taming Mace,符箓 eroded into a thousand holes by the Ten Extremes True Qi... In the end, he only found a gray, unremarkable pouch at each person's waist.

Judging by its style, it should be the standard-issue Spatial Bag of the Primordial Origin Sect.

"...The seventh level can use the true meaning of the mountains to suppress inner demons, the eighth level..."

Chen Jiuchuan's voice suddenly tightened. Xu Yunfan was standing before him at some unknown time, the seven Spatial Bags jingling in his palm.

Chen Jiuchuan still gritted his teeth, spitting out the words one by one until he finished the last character, looking at Xu Yunfan with eager eyes.

Meeting the other's nervous gaze, Xu Yunfan said calmly, "Finished?"

"Not a single false word!" Chen Jiuchuan's Adam's apple bobbed. "This scripture is considered a top-tier cultivation method even in the Taihua Spirit Void Realm. It was relied upon by the Hundred Mountains True Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect to establish his Foundation, lifting a thousand mountains and ten thousand peaks to achieve his Dao Foundation. How could a junior dare..."

Xu Yunfan glanced at a prompt that appeared in his vision.

*'You are learning the Hundred Mountains Suppressing Demon Scripture, and you seem to have a faint realization...'*

*Quite interesting.*

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but complain inwardly.明明被 called the Primordial Origin Demon Sect, yet the cultivation method is named the Hundred Mountains Suppressing Demon Scripture—it's quite unexpected.

He raised his hand and shook the Spatial Bag in it. "How do I open it?"

Chen Jiuchuan swallowed, looking at it with envy.

He had certainly engaged in killing and arson to build up wealth, but to obtain seven storage bags at once was enough to be called a sudden fortune overnight.

"Just need to breathe in true qi, focus your mind to gather, and sink your thoughts to perceive the items inside the Spatial Bag."

Chen Jiuchuan glanced at the corpses on the ground, which were almost ruined, and continued, "These people are already dead, the seals on the storage bags will also disappear, so there are no restrictions."

Xu Yunfan followed Chen Jiuchuan's method, sinking his heart and focusing. The Ten Extremes True Qi kept surging, and strands of red mist shimmered at his fingertips.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, subconsciously turning his head to look at the female disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect not far away.

Xu Yunfan's true qi flowed through his fingertips, and the mouth of the Spatial Bag emitted a faint spiritual light.

Sensing the items stored inside, he raised an eyebrow. This was clearly the personal item of that female disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect. Inside the bag, besides a few belly bands embroidered with protective talisman patterns, there were also three bottles of "Jade Marrow Heart-Nourishing Pills" neatly arranged.

This Spatial Bag was neither too big nor too small, about a zhang in size. With true qi poured in and thoughts seizing, the speed of retrieving items was quite fast; a mere swipe of the hand could complete the task.
