# Chapter 585: Primordial Qi of the Heavenly Realm's Roots

Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes, a hint of exhaustion flashing in their depths, but more so a sense of relieved joy.

After repeated calculations and confirmation, while his own karmic threads had, due to the final contact, entangled with a trace of an extremely obscure and faint Dao rhyme through the Empress's hand, their origin had already been concealed by the Star Banner and the Empress. They had not truly become chaotic and pointed back to him; rather, they seemed more like ownerless, scattered remnants.

More importantly, various signs indicated that the three lofty True Lords were currently entirely focused on the struggle for the massive Heavenly Emperor's Dao Fruit and the Western Buddha's Head Dao Fruit, leaving them no time to spare attention elsewhere.

This Yin Dao Fruit, condensed by the Heavenly Realm, was entirely a hidden Dao Fruit. As long as its aura was not leaked, then he was safe.

Within this Heavenly Realm, those Golden Core True Lords could not trace him through the Heavenly Dao's karmic connections.

The Empress taking the fruit had not yet been used as bait to lure him.

The greatest fortune had quietly fallen into his grasp.

The greatest harvest of this realm had already been obtained by him.

Those Golden Core True Lords still had to divide the Heavenly Dao and the Western Buddha's Head Tathagata's Dao Fruit among themselves. For him to enjoy a Dao Fruit alone was naturally a joyous piece of news.

Xu Yunfan forcefully suppressed the urge to immediately take out the Star Spirit Banner to carefully inspect the mirror and the changes within the Empress. He naturally knew this was not a place to study precious treasures.

After resting for a long time, he finally calmed his mind.

His gaze turned to the Primordial Qi of the Heavenly Realm's Roots, which permeated the surroundings like undifferentiated chaos.

This was the power of the world's foundation, scattered after the Heavenly Realm's origin was plundered and collapsed. It held immense nourishing benefits for stabilizing his nascent Cavern Heaven.

Now that the Primordial Origin Sect and the three True Lords of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect had shattered this great realm, collecting the Primordial Qi of the Heavenly Realm's Roots was much easier than before.

This was the optimal cultivation environment to gather the Primordial Qi and step into the late Foundation Establishment stage.

Although with the Attribute Panel, progressing step by step to the late Foundation Establishment stage was a certainty, Xu Yunfan would not refuse anything that could speed up his cultivation.

This place was perfectly suited to his needs.

It was just the right excuse to cover up any traces from his journey.

Next, it was time to peacefully absorb the Primordial Qi, strengthen his nascent Cavern Heaven, and step into the late Foundation Establishment stage in one go.

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated and sat cross-legged.

The Nine Heavens of the Divine Thunder, Profound Firmament, and Undying True Scripture operated at full power, and in an instant, a faint purple-gold lightning glow appeared on his body's surface.

In his sea of consciousness, the nascent Cavern Heaven, which had already taken initial form, was immediately wreathed in the absorbed Primordial Qi.

A strange spatial shadow, wrapped in dense purple qi with flashes of thunder and flickering starlight within, slowly manifested one inch above his Baihui acupoint under the operation of the true scripture and the催动 of his spiritual power. Although it was still extremely illusory and small, it emitted a powerful suction force as if it were opening an inner universe.

*Inhale!*

Like a giant whale drawing in water, the pure Primordial Qi of the Heavenly Realm's Roots, filled with the power of world remnants, was slowly lifted by Xu Yunfan and frantically swallowed by the suction force emanating from the nascent Cavern Heaven above his Baihui point.

Countless streams of pure energy—earthy yellow, cyan, and even mixed with threads of gold and silver—like rivers pouring into a vortex, continuously poured into that nascent Cavern Heaven.

Nourished, the nascent world began to undergo visible changes.

'You have absorbed the Primordial Qi of the Heavenly Realm's Roots. Your proficiency in the Nine Heavens of the Divine Thunder, Profound Firmament, and Undying True Scripture has increased by 2.'

'You have absorbed the Primordial Qi of the Heavenly Realm's Roots...'

Not bad!

Xu Yunfan's spirit was lifted. Seeing the panel information popping up in his vision, he was naturally extremely delighted.

In the past, even if he practiced diligently day and night for ten days or half a month, he might not increase a single point of proficiency. Now, in just half a day, he had gained two points.

How could this not make his heart feel comfortable?

As time passed, the proficiency panel in his vision continued to jump.

The turbulent, chaotic edges of the nascent world, which were on the verge of shattering, became clearer. The thunder born and dying within seemed stronger and brighter, and the flickering starlight also appeared to have gained a hint of stability.

The entire nascent world slowly rotated, emitting a faint resonance, as if greedily absorbing nutrients from the great realm, like an embryo growing.

Xu Yunfan's mind was free of distractions, his entire consciousness immersed in controlling and guiding the nascent Cavern Heaven, guiding the flow of the Primordial Qi, consolidating the world's foundation, and sorting out the faintly chaotic elemental forces of earth, water, fire, and wind within the nascent world.

The strife and clamor of the shattered realm outside, the majestic pressure of the True Lords, seemed all to be isolated from his perception.

What he had to do now was to act like the most honest ascetic practitioner, in this desolate corner, step by step, absorbing the Primordial Qi of the Heavenly Realm's Roots, strengthening the nascent world, pushing his Dao Foundation to the peak of the late Foundation Establishment stage, and even touching the threshold of a higher realm.

In the time that followed, Xu Yunfan completely immersed himself in endless breathing and cultivation.

For Foundation Establishment cultivators who had not yet condensed a nascent Cavern Heaven, the Primordial Qi scattered throughout the shattered realm might be a violent energy difficult to capture and refine.

But for Xu Yunfan, currently operating the Nine Heavens of the Divine Thunder, Profound Firmament, and Undying True Scripture, it was like a whale swallowing the four seas. It was truly the finest nourishment for constructing a nascent Cavern Heaven and tempering his own body.

Now, the attack and collapse of the entire realm were not things that could be accomplished in a single day. Even under the vast Dao Realm projection of the Universal Salvation True Lord, the Heavenly Court collapsed, the mountains and rivers were shattered, and the core Dao Fruits of the Heavenly Emperor and the Western Buddha's Head Tathagata were divided, but this realm, which had existed for countless tens of thousands of years, required a long time to wear away its foundation and the dissolution of its residual laws.

Only then could it slowly merge into the Taihua Spirit Ruin Realm.

Completely extinguishing its origin will might not be difficult, but to squeeze out every bit of its value, especially to completely break down and digest the fundamental laws that supported the several Dao Fruits, was a meticulous task that required slow, detailed work for the True Lords.

After all, the boundless merit bestowed by the Heavenly Dao of the Taihua Spirit Ruin Realm was also of great benefit to them.

Even if they were like big rats, they were naturally willing to do it.

Cultivation knew no seasons.

The nascent lightning pool within his Dantian, from drops汇聚 into an abyssal sea. Violent lightning energy was born and died within the nascent Cavern Heaven, and every tremor triggered a transformation throughout his four limbs and hundred bones.

The nascent Cavern Heaven, already positioned above the Baihui point on his head, was originally an illusory and blurry space of only a zhang in radius. Under the continuous watering of the Primordial Qi of the Heavenly Realm's Roots day after day, the turbulent chaotic mist at its edges gradually became clear and stable.

The dense purple qi condensed like gauze. The thunder born and died within, initially tiny purple lightning serpents, gradually grew into roaring, clawed purple lightning dragons. Every breath seemed to exhale the power of destruction and rebirth.

The flickering starlight was no longer drifting, unstable dust, but became increasingly stable and bright, outlining the faint trajectories of constellations.

The entire miniature Cavern Heaven slowly rotated, emitting a low and continuous hum, like an embryo greedily sucking nutrients from its mother's body, constantly growing stronger.

'You have absorbed the Primordial Qi of the Heavenly Realm's Roots. Your proficiency in the Nine Heavens of the Divine Thunder, Profound Firmament, and Undying True Scripture has increased by 3.'

'The stability of the nascent Cavern Heaven has increased, and the barrier to the next realm has loosened...'
