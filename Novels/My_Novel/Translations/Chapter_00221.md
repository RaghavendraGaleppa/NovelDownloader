Chapter 221: Past Enemies, the Lady Besieged

Wu Fengzi ran several miles, nose bleeding and ears dripping blood. He found a cool, shaded spot under a tree to rest.

He let out pained hisses, yet the corners of his mouth were turned up in a smile. His expression was strange, bordering on madness. It took a good while for him to calm down. "Impressive, truly impressive! But taking my 'Vajra Palm' couldn't have been pleasant for her either."

Though the exchange was brief, the danger within it surpassed that of a flood dragon rushing down a river by several times. Wu Fengzi was not of sound mind, seeking martial arts for fun. That he had survived until today was proof of his formidable strength.

The Vajra Palm's energy was domineering and upright; only those of pure heart could learn it. Wu Fengzi, with his mind wholly devoted to martial arts, was pure in thought. He had long since perfected the Vajra Palm, reaching a level of mastery that was shocking to the world.

His intuition was sharp. The moment he saw Wen Caishang, he knew she was a grand master. He could only exchange one move, so he naturally sought to give it his all. Thus, he gathered all his Qi and energy into a single palm strike.

Wu Fengzi was forced to take the blow. His old injuries had not healed, and he had forcefully circulated his energy. Wu Fengzi was shaken to the point where his internal organs bled, and he lost half his life.

"So powerful, so powerful," Wu Fengzi muttered, his eyelids growing heavy. Wen Caishang was furious with him, her palm carrying a killing intent.

Wu Fengzi gradually came to his senses, his breath weakening, and he fell into a deep sleep. But he was tough by nature and would surely survive.

On the other side.

After exchanging palms with Wu Fengzi, Wen Caishang took four steps back, her sleeve flicking to the right. She released the residual force of the Vajra Palm, and with several loud bangs, a row of large trees collapsed in unison.

Li Xian called out, "My Lady!" and stepped forward to support her. Wen Caishang took a heavy breath and said, "I'm fine."

A shadow of gloom crossed her heart: *If I were not sick or injured, this madman Wu Fengzi would not have dared to seek me out; I would have killed him. But with my major injury, his纠缠 caused my condition to worsen. It was unbearable, so I had to deal with him this way. I didn't expect his palm energy to be so profound; I still couldn't avoid aggravating my injury.*

Her beautiful eyes held a killing intent. Everything was going wrong, one after another. Wen Caishang suddenly felt three-tenths of the palm energy lingering in her body, refusing to dissipate.

"I first used the Soft Wind Gentle Palm to counter it. This palm technique uses softness to overcome hardness, and it should have been able to dissolve his move. How was I to know that in a single move, that fellow poured all his Qi and energy into it? I immediately retaliated with the 'Silkworm Dream Killing Palm,' aiming to kill him with one strike. He has fainted now."

Wen Caishang sat cross-legged. Her internal organs and acupoints felt as if they had been struck by lightning. Her old injuries had not healed, and new ones were added. The Vajra Palm energy, mixed with residual lightning power, faintly transmitted a "Buddhist chant." Wen Caishang could not suppress this force and could no longer hide her condition, spitting out a mouthful of blood. Her face turned deathly pale in an instant.

"My Lady?" Li Xian asked, moving to support her. Wen Caishang mocked herself, saying, "To think I, Wen Caishang, would end up in such a situation."

Li Xian asked gravely, "My Lady, what has happened?"

"That madman Wu Fengzi's Vajra Palm comes from the 'Thunderclap Monastery.' His palm energy and the lightning power in my body actually resonated with each other, transforming into a Vajra Buddhist Chant. The vibration made my injuries even worse!" Wen Caishang said.

Although the Vajra Palm's energy was fierce and hard, she had handled it properly with her superior martial principles, and it should have only slightly aggravated her injuries. But she did not expect the Vajra Palm energy and the power of the lightning to combine, creating a resonance within her body that instantly unleashed a killing force.

It was as if Wen Caishang, caught off guard, had been struck by a Vajra Buddhist Chant Palm.

Li Xian said, "My Lady, we should find an inn to rest and properly recover. Then we can plan our return journey!"

Wen Caishang nodded. "You are right." Having faced danger consecutively, her face was pale, giving her a pitiable look.

Li Xian supported Wen Caishang and walked back to the main road. The carriage had collapsed and the horse was dead; they were useless. The only way forward was on foot.

Although Wen Caishang had suffered heavy blows and was naturally weak, she still retained sixty percent of her strength, which was far beyond that of an ordinary person. Li Xian remained calm, thinking to himself: *My Lady and I have many enemies. To be safe, we must be careful in our actions.*

As they walked on the road, Wen Caishang's blood and Qi gradually returned. "If another powerful enemy appears, I will avoid fighting if possible. Fortunately, Li Xian is here to help me deal with minor threats."

Sickness brings many thoughts.

Wen Caishang had suffered repeated setbacks, as if fighting against the heavens themselves. Seeing Li Xian caring for her by her side, she felt greatly comforted.

They walked along the road for about a day without seeing any signs of people. It was early spring, with lush vegetation and warm weather.

Li Xian lit a bonfire and roasted two wild rabbits. "My Lady, you have suffered a serious injury. You should eat something."

Wen Caishang hesitated for a moment, then said, "Alright." After eating the rabbit, she sat down to meditate and regulate her breathing. Although her condition was poor, her strength was still formidable, and she was capable of self-regulation.

The next day.

The sky had just begun to brighten. The mountains were shrouded in a thick mist, and the air was heavy with humidity. Li Xian practiced his fists in the morning, the sound of his strikes was startlingly powerful.

[You have digested the精华 within your body. Food Essence Stage, proficiency +1]

Half of the essence from the Golden Carp in the pond still remained. Li Xian gradually digested it. The morning sun slanted down, and his body seemed to be wrapped in a faint white light. His physical body was pure and flawless.

After Wen Caishang rested for a while, Li Xian supported her as they continued on. By noon, they arrived at a bustling market town. Li Xian said, "My Lady, we will stay here for a long time. I will find some medicinal herbs for you to recover."

Wen Caishang felt a sense of relief and joy. "That will do."

They found an inn, rented two superior rooms, and helped Wen Caishang move in. Wen Caishang was well-versed in pharmacology. She wrote down a prescription and gave it to Li Xian to prepare.

The prescription was for "strengthening the body and nurturing the root." It was ineffective against "lightning injuries" or "palm injuries," but for all illnesses and injuries, strengthening the foundation was always useful. Moreover, the herbs were easy to find, allowing for gradual recovery.

Li Xian went directly to the pharmacy to buy the herbs according to the prescription. The pharmacy assistant took one glance at the prescription and waved his hand impatiently. "Out of stock, out of stock. Go somewhere else!"

Li Xian frowned. "Why are you out of stock? None of the herbs on this prescription are rare. I see your pharmacy is of a decent size; how could you be out of stock?"

The assistant glared. "I said we're out of stock, so we're out of stock. Why are you asking so many questions?"

"Call your shopkeeper," Li Xian said calmly.

"Hey, you little..." The pharmacy assistant wasn't intimidated at all. "You greenhorn, I can tell you're an outsider. I'm advising you to scram. If you're looking for trouble, you'll be the one to suffer!"

Li Xian was a modest man and didn't like to cause trouble. If the herbs were truly sold out, it would be normal to go to another pharmacy. But he was sharp-witted and could see something was wrong. This pharmacy was intentionally refusing to sell, and the other pharmacies were likely the same.

This matter had to be resolved on the spot for a clean conclusion. "Is that so?" As he spoke, he made a sudden, fierce move, grabbing the pharmacy assistant and lifting him up.

The assistant trembled in fear, his arrogance vanishing completely as he begged for mercy. Li Xian threw him to the ground. "Why won't you sell me the herbs? Speak quickly. Otherwise, one punch from me, and you won't have a life left."

"Big... Big Master..." the assistant said with a grim face. "I'm just an ordinary assistant, how could I have the power to refuse to sell you herbs! But... our shopkeeper said that to sell medicine here, you have to recognize the prescription."

"Recognize the prescription?" Li Xian asked.

"Yes, yes," the assistant said. "Your prescription, looking at the properties and compatibility of the herbs, is reasonable enough. But the handwriting is wrong."

"It has to be a prescription written by a physician from our city to buy medicine here. You... you... could beat me to death, and it wouldn't help!"

The imperial court was in chaos, and the situation was unclear. In some places, local landlords had grown powerful, colluding with various trade forces in the city to amass wealth through vicious means.

Medical clinics and pharmacies colluded, arbitrarily raising prices, making it difficult for common people to see a doctor or get medicine, causing great suffering. Qingning County had a similar trend, but it had not yet reached this point.

Li Xian understood. He knew that beating the assistant would be useless and would only cause trouble, which would be bad. He let go and left, seeking out the black market in the city to buy the herbs.

He had not read medical books, but through exposure and his lady's casual instructions, he had remembered much. He could recognize seven or eight out of ten common herbs.

He purchased the herbs one by one. After about half an hour, he had gathered everything. It cost several taels of silver, which pained him greatly. Just as he was about to return, he heard two martial artists in a street corner whispering, mentioning the words "The折剑夫人 (Zhejian Furen, the Sword-Broken Lady)."

Li Xian's brow furrowed slightly, and his vigilance rose. He knew his lady had many enemies. He quietly moved closer, smeared his face with dirt to darken it, and listened in.

The two men were saying:

"It's strange, that Zhejian Furen is some character, to have two of our great sects come all this way to kill her."

"Indeed. I heard she attended some Dragon Appreciation Banquet. Didn't we see her a while back? Man, the Benhua River was surging endlessly, rushing for ten thousand miles. I heard a dragon was ascending the river!"

"Tell me, do dragons really exist in this world?"

"Alas, whether dragons exist or not has nothing to do with us. But I heard the Zhejian Furen was supposed to appear four ten-thousand miles up the Benhua River. Our Taixin Sect and Huangsha Gate ambushed her there, but we missed her."

"I'm curious, who is this Zhejian Furen to have so many heroes chasing her? That's a real skill in itself."

"That's exactly it; her skill is too great, so they won't rest until she's dead. The Zhejian Furen disappeared for a long time, but now she has appeared again. Many sects have old grudges with her. This time, they've joined forces to kill her. As the saying goes, 'The first charge is full of vigor, the second is weakened, and the third is exhausted.'"

"Brother Wang is right. This Zhejian Furen is definitely formidable. If we gather our forces to kill her and still fail, we'll be scattered like sand. If she comes for revenge later, won't we be in a miserable state?"

"Exactly. That's why, even though the Dragon Appreciation Banquet is long over, all the sects are still searching for clues about the Zhejian Furen. They refuse to give up!"

Li Xian heard everything and felt a sense of dread. These forces had struck with lightning speed and would not let Wen Caishang go, which naturally meant they would not let him go either.

He continued to listen:

"You know, the Zhejian Furen should be nearby."

"A few days ago, someone saw a dragon and a python flying, carrying the Zhejian Furen, and they landed in the river nearby."

"We haven't seen the Zhejian Furen ourselves, but many experts along the river have. This time the Zhejian Furen has returned to the Jianghu, it seems she has a pretty boy with her?"

"Right, I heard that too. I heard the Zhejian Furen keeps that pretty boy as a gigolo. Pah, what a lewd witch, no wonder she's ruthless."

"Our elder has given the order; that pretty boy won't be living this time either."

Li Xian remained silent. He had expected this, and his heart was calm. *These sects have irreconcilable grudges. Now my lady is seriously injured; I don't know how much strength she has left. I'll go back, inform my lady, and be careful.*

He took a step back, about to leave.

Just then, a man in blue clothes ran quickly to their location, shouting, "Are you two the heroes from the Taixin Sect and Huangsha Gate?"

The two men cupped their fists. "We are! And you, brother, are you from the Jianyu Tower?"

The man in blue nodded. "What are you two doing here?"

"We are guarding the black market, searching for clues about that wicked woman," the two replied.

"No need to search," the man in blue said gravely.

"Why?" the two asked.

The man in blue said:

"We've already found the Zhejian Furen's location. Come with me quickly! Let's join forces to kill this villainous woman!"
