# Chapter 244: Stirrings of the Heart

A wisp of sword energy, just nurtured within his meridians, was instantly propelled by his internal force, flowing through his blood vessels straight to his fingertips.

*Pfft!*

A faint, almost inaudible sound erupted.

Pei Yan's pupils constricted violently as he watched, dumbfounded, as a thumb-sized hole exploded in the bluestone beneath Xu Yunfan's feet.

The edges of the penetrating wound were tinged with a bronze-colored scorch mark, its inner walls covered in spiral patterns, and its deepest part was unnervingly smooth and round, as if carved by a sharp blade.

This was the hallmark of the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art reaching great completion: Upper Cycle sword qi repels evil, Middle Cycle melts iron to forge form, and Lower Cycle spirals to temper its edge!

"The Sword Pavilion's true disciples require three years of medicinal baths to..."

Pei Yan's fingertips brushed against the scorch marks at the edge of the hole. The heart-wrenching pain he endured while soaking in the medicinal spring years ago was still vivid in his memory.

As the Sword Pavilion's first disciple with a天生的 Sword Bone, although he was said to have mastered the basics in seven days, he had still needed to temper his body with secret medicines for a full half-year to achieve that result.

And this fellow before him, a cultivator of unknown origin, had actually achieved this solely through the physique of the Blood Transformation Realm, without using a single drop of Jade Marrow Vein Cleansing Powder...

"How is it?"

"...It is indeed the Three Cycles Sword Energy."

Pei Yan's voice was hoarse, his expression filled with disbelief.

He had mastered it overnight.

If he had a divine sword as a supplement, that sword energy could transform into sword qi in an instant.

If Xu Yunfan were placed within the Sword Pavilion, even the legendary Grand Elder who rarely showed himself would have to claw his way out of his coffin to fight for him, refusing to give up.

He looked up at Xu Yunfan's calm expression and began to doubt his own life.

He, with his天生的 Sword Bone, was actually inferior to this barbarian who played with hammers?!

After a long while, Pei Yan felt a slight sense of relief. If he were to pass on the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Technique, it wouldn't be considered a waste.

Having made up his mind, the blood color drained from his face once more. He collapsed onto the ground, threads of blood seeping from his body, looking utterly weak and on the verge of death.

"Help me recover from my injuries and cleanse the flood dragon venom from my body, and I will teach you the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Technique."

"..."

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate upon hearing this and agreed immediately, afraid that Pei Yan might get too excited and die on the spot.

As the twilight stained the remaining clouds with the color of rust, Xu Yunfan's knuckles rapped against the dark mouth of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer.

Qi Huan, understanding the hint, picked up the half-eaten spine of the tiger demon and walked out of the cave, quickly retreating into the shade of the mountain to enjoy his meal.

The赤色 lightning patterns dancing on the surface of the heavy hammer had already branded a spiderweb of scorch marks onto the ground. If he didn't leave soon, Xu Yunfan would come over with his hammer.

The moment Xu Yunfan grabbed the back of Pei Yan's collar, his Hundred-Forge Steel Body emitted a metallic tremor, and the bedrock beneath his feet cracked with the sound.

As he leaped up the cliff, the gaps in his dragon-scale armor shot out streams of赤色 qi, turning any withered trees in their path into spiraled, charred wood.

Even with such rough handling, Pei Yan tightly pursed his thin lips, remaining silent. The unhealed wound on his wrist from the flood dragon venom seeped青-black blood droplets, leaving a winding trail of poison in the wind.

Thirty miles away.

Deep within a crevice in a mountain hollow, dark purple flames licked out. Xu Yunfan钻入 the crevice, his boots touching the ground.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the molten earthfire within this small world's secret realm. The temperature at its center was terrifyingly high, far superior to the original Thunderfire Pool in the Heavenly Work Cave, or the current Red Fire Cave.

If he could forge a weapon here, the many high-quality metal ores could be quickly melted.

"Brother Pei, you've been at the Heavenly Work Cave for many days. Have you ever heard the quenching sound during sword forging?" Xu Yunfan said as he tore the silk ribbon tying Pei Yan's hair and used it to blindfold him.

Despite the scorching heat that quickly drenched Pei Yan in sweat, his expression remained unchanged.

"I have heard a few hammer strikes. Master Zhan Yan's forging skills are truly worthy of their reputation."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but grin upon hearing this. This guy, even at a time like this, was still nervous and ended up flattering him.

"Are you ready, Brother Pei?"

Pei Yan didn't resist. He was on his last breath; even if Xu Yunfan wanted to kill him, he could only close his eyes and await his fate.

"Go ahead, Brother Xu."

With a mechanical click, Pei Yan felt something approach his nose.

"Take a deep breath."

Pei Yan did as he was told and took a deep breath.

In an instant, a heat as intense as molten lava rushed from his nostrils into his lungs.

Pei Yan's eyes shot wide open, the silk blindfold even snapping from the force. He curled up beside the earthfire pool, his muscles bulging, veins popping, and the青-black flood dragon venom became even more prominent on his skin.

Soon,赤红色斑纹 appeared on his skin, as if a red-hot烙铁 were moving beneath the surface. The veins on his neck swelled like gnarled tree roots, each血管 throbbing.

His originally fair face was now a交织 of青-black毒纹 and赤-red参气. The紫-black scab on his left arm wound melted into a viscous poison under the high temperature, dripping into the earthfire pool with a sizzling sound.

He convulsed violently by the pool's edge, the clothes on his back torn to shreds by his狂乱 internal force, leaving his spine clearly visible.

As the Ginseng Qi churned in his organs, the three焦 meridians in his chest and abdomen flickered with a golden light, like three细 swords moving beneath his skin.

The墨-colored纹路 formed by the flood dragon venom writhed across his skin like living things, forming a tug-of-war with the molten-like Ginseng Qi. Each collision caused fine blood pearls to seep from his pores,蒸腾 into scarlet mist in the high heat.

Xu Yunfan slowly backed away, watching Pei Yan's struggles and spasms on the ground with a calm expression.

He had already given Pei Yan the greatest opportunity. If he still couldn't survive, then Xu Yunfan could only say he was helpless. And moreover...

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes, his gaze devoid of any emotion.

The Ginseng Spirit born from the Ten Thousand Year Ginseng King was extremely important and must not be known by anyone.

If Pei Yan recovered and went to take revenge on the flood dragon, dying in the process, then everything would be perfect. If not...

He would have to seize the opportunity within this small world's secret realm.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged, took a quiet breath of Ginseng Qi for himself, and began to cultivate the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art.

This place was too confined to施展 the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shaking Hammer Method. The Sword Nurturing Art was a静功, only requiring him to continuously drive his internal force through the three焦 meridians to forge sword energy.

With Ginseng Qi as a supplement, his cultivation speed was extremely fast.

*As you cultivate the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art, you inhaled a mouthful of Ten Thousand Year Ginseng Qi. The internal force in your blood became exceptionally active, catalyzing a significant amount of sword energy. Proficiency in the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art has increased.*

*...*

In less than an hour, the proficiency on his interface was practically刷屏.

Thirty-six points of proficiency!

Xu Yunfan's spirit was lifted. At this rate, in less than twenty days, he would be able to bring the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art to minor completion.

Although this sword-nurturing art wasn't some exquisite sword path, it was an extremely effective surprise attack method.

In the heat of battle, a single breath could expel a wisp of sword energy capable of piercing metal and stone, more than enough to be致命.
