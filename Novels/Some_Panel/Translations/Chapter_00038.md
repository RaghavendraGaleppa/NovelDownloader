# Chapter 38: Mang Biao, Second Island Master

As for the Sword Dao imprints, unlike humanoid weapons that contained considerable scriptures, they were very profound and difficult to grasp. However, after nearly a year of contemplation, he had finally gained some insights and expected to make further progress soon.

Thus, he spent his days refining pills, cultivating, and comprehending divine abilities.

Another month passed in the blink of an eye.

It was on this very day that another group of uninvited guests arrived outside his island pillar.

"Island Master, that Alchemy Master resides within the island pillar ahead. I tracked Golden Abacus here before and confirmed his whereabouts."

"An Alchemy Master living in a place like this? It seems he truly hasn't joined any major power. Haha, today we'll capture him and bring him back."

"Congratulations, Island Master, on capturing an Alchemy Master! This is someone capable of refining Demonic Essence Pills. Our Black Wind Society's strength is surely about to increase."

"Haha, if he truly is an Alchemy Master, he's worth me personally making a move. It's not too late to congratulate after we've captured him. Come, let's go."

A group of eight people swept through the wind, rapidly approaching. With a resounding boom, they landed on the island pillar, creating a significant disturbance.

"Fellow Daoist, come out and show yourself! Don't hide, I know you're in there."

A deep, booming voice reverberated, like ancient thunder echoing in his ears, lingering for a long time. Yang Ji's eardrums vibrated, and his head felt somewhat dizzy. He immediately knew that the newcomers meant trouble. What frustrated him was that after Changyuan came to his previous island pillar, he had already moved to another one, knowing he was exposed. How did another group of ruthless individuals find him so quickly?

As Yang Ji's expression darkened slightly, he pushed open the stone door and flew onto the island pillar.

He was met with the sight of a burly man with large ears, a broad nose, a square mouth, and a bristly beard. The thick, dark hair exposed on his chest was unashamedly heart-shaped. The big man's large eyes were slightly slanted, glinting with an unfriendly light. Anyone could tell he was not a good person.

Yet, such a person was in the early Core Formation stage. Even more infuriating, he possessed a top-grade root bone. There was simply no justice in this world!

Yang Ji felt indignant. He mused inwardly, "How can someone as handsome, suave, dignified, an extraordinary talent, and with immortal jade bones like myself only possess a low-grade root bone, while this rough brute has a top-grade spiritual root? This is truly an outrage!"

As he envied the man, he shot him a resentful look.

"Hmm? This brat..." The burly man's bronze-bell-like eyes shifted. He subconsciously adjusted his loose robes, covering the heart-shaped patch of black hair on his chest. Then, his brows furrowed slightly, and he turned to subtly transmit a message to a refined-looking middle-aged man behind him: "This brat looks awfully young. Is he truly an Alchemy Master? Could you have made a mistake?"

"Absolutely not. Whether he is or not, Island Master should capture him first and then we'll discuss it," the middle-aged man transmitted back.

Capture him? Yang Ji's brows furrowed slightly.

"Young one, when Golden Abacus traded with me, he said your alchemy skills were even better than Master Changyuan's? Since you're an Alchemy Master, possessing such profound pill-crafting techniques, why do you need to dwell alone on this isolated island pillar? Come, follow me to Black Wind Island and enjoy a life of ease."

The burly man grinned, his mouth wide open as if to devour someone, his eyes revealing naked dominance.

Golden Abacus? That fellow is truly harming me, a useless teammate! When did I become an Alchemy Master? The pills I refined weren't even made with my full strength; their quality barely touched the superior grade. Yet he dragged Master Changyuan's name into this to add weight? He's forcibly pinned the title of 'Alchemy Master' on me.

Yang Ji cursed Golden Abacus for being so short-sighted. Now, he had attracted a Core Formation True Person, with a group of malevolent late Foundation Establishment cultivators behind him. This was truly a difficult situation.

As his thoughts churned, Yang Ji composed himself. He smiled faintly, cupped his hands, and said, "Go to Black Wind Island to enjoy ease? I appreciate Senior's good intentions, but I am due to return to the Jin Family with Golden Abacus tomorrow. Going to Black Wind Island would be quite inconvenient. Perhaps another time."

"Hmph! Trying to act smart in front of me? Do you think I'm discussing this with you? When our Black Wind Society does things, we never consider anyone's feelings. You actually dare to bring up the Jin Family to pressure me? The Jin Family only has three Core Formation True Persons; our Black Wind Society isn't afraid. As a Core Formation True Person, I've brought a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators here to invite you, giving you, an Alchemy Master, ample face. If you refuse to come, then I'll have to take you by force. And if I hurt you, I won't feel a shred of pity." The burly man glared and roared, quite menacingly.

"Little brother, come with us. Black Wind Island is much better than this place," the others behind the burly man chuckled sinisterly, their threat quite potent.

This brute looks rough, but his mind is surprisingly meticulous. This is tricky, Yang Ji thought, frowning. He stared at the big man, then cupped his hands and smiled, "May I ask Senior's esteemed name?"

"Me, Mang Biao, Island Master of Black Wind Island, Guild Master of Black Wind Society. You can call me Island Master or Guild Master, either is fine. After all, you'll be one of my people from now on," Mang Biao declared, puffing out his chest.

"So it's Senior Mang! Why are you wandering around instead of recuperating on your island?" Yang Ji smiled faintly as he spoke.

"Recuperating?" Mang Biao's eyes narrowed, filled with suspicion. "I'm perfectly fine. Why would I need to recuperate?"

"I observe that Senior's complexion is dark, your brow is furrowed with malevolence, and a faint戾气 (malevolence/violence) surges within your pupils. I presume that you often find it difficult to enter meditative states during cultivation, frequently become irritable, and your true qi often becomes uncontrollable, as if on the verge of backfiring. Am I correct?"

Yang Ji saw that Mang Biao's head displayed: [Has consumed too many inferior Demonic Essence Pills, demonic qi has invaded, true qi is impure, risking qi deviation]. So, he spoke in such a mystical way.

"To say that the Guild Master's true qi is out of control, what a joke!" Someone behind him scoffed with a laugh.

But Mang Biao, hearing this, was inwardly shaken and secretly astonished. "I've never told anyone about these symptoms. How does this kid know? Is he perhaps also a physician?"

Yang Ji saw that the smile and dominance on Mang Biao's face gradually receded, and the tag [Solemn] appeared above his head. He knew that these words had touched his very soul. Immediately, he delivered another potent blow, feigning profundity as he chuckled, "Your Guild Master is practically on the verge of qi deviation, and you can still laugh?"

"Hmph! Stop spreading alarmist rumors and come with us quickly!" Someone behind him said sharply.

Qi deviation? Mang Biao's eyelid twitched violently when he heard this, and [Fear] appeared above his head. He first let out a loud laugh, feigning composure, and then casually said, "What you're saying is truly amusing. I, Mang Biao, am perfectly fine, yet you're almost talking me into my grave. It's a pity you're not a fortune teller."

He spoke thus on the surface, but secretly transmitted a weak message, "Little brother, how did you see that?"

Yang Ji felt somewhat calmer now. He smiled at Mang Biao and transmitted, "A single glance was enough!"

"Can it still be cured?"

"It can! However, it's very difficult. Besides me, there is absolutely no one else!"

Mang Biao let out a long sigh of relief. His eyes flickered as he transmitted, "I felt a peculiar closeness to little brother the moment I saw you. How about we become sworn brothers today?"

"Sworn brothers?" Yang Ji was startled.

Mang Biao, however, paid no mind to Yang Ji. He immediately stepped forward, clasped Yang Ji's shoulder, turned, and laughed at the crowd behind him, "This little brother and I, Mang Biao, are destined to be friends. He deeply pleases me. From now on, he will be the Second Island Master of our Black Wind Island! Quick, all of you, greet the Second Island Master!"

"" The crowd behind him was momentarily stunned. They exchanged glances, filled with doubt, wondering if their Island Master had lost his mind.

Mang Biao naturally noticed their expressions, but he had his own plans. He roared, "What? Didn't you hear me? Why aren't you greeting the Second Island Master?"

He spoke firmly on the surface, but secretly transmitted to the crowd, "Keep him stable for now; I have my own plans."

The crowd exchanged glances, then immediately smiled and cupped their hands, calling out, "Greetings, Second Island Master!"

"This Mang Biao is playing tricks again, offering me a so-called 'Second Island Master' title just to get me to treat him?" Yang Ji's eyes narrowed slightly, he thought. "If that's the case, I'll just have to play along for now."

For now, he couldn't think of any better strategy, so he had to temporarily go along with it.

Mang Biao burst into laughter. "Haha, little brother, I still don't know your name!"

"Yang Ji!" Yang Ji replied, cupping his hands.

"Haha, so it's little brother Yang! Come, come, let's return to Black Wind Island!" Without waiting for a word, Mang Biao clapped him on the shoulder and flew into the sky.
