# Chapter 4: The Situation Is Somewhat Complicated  

Exhausted, Madam Lu collapsed onto the edge of the bed.  

Xiao Ji pressed two fingers toward the lower abdomen of the weakened woman.  

"Don't push them in!" Lu Jinyin anxiously warned.  

The fingers stopped half an inch away from the woman's navel.  

Within a three-inch radius, Xiao Ji perceived all information, filtering out the irrelevant—such as the food being digested in her stomach or the movement in her intestines—and focusing only on the crucial details.  

Soon, he obtained the results he sought.  

Three key pieces of information emerged:  

1. **The pregnant woman**, having carried the child for three and a half years, was weak and exhausted. If the baby was not delivered within the next hour, she would die.  
2. **The fetus**, an innate Dao Seed, was a single-spiritual-root prodigy. It had developed self-awareness at eight months in the womb and was now fully matured at forty months, with strong and healthy vital signs—almost excessively so.  
3. **The evil infant spirit**, a parasitic entity that had taken physical form inside the woman, was currently being restrained by the innate Dao Seed, which had it in a chokehold.  

"Your wife is not carrying a malevolent spirit," Xiao Ji stated calmly. "Rather, she carries an extraordinary child."  

At these words, Madam Lu seemed to regain a flicker of vitality, while the others looked on in confusion.  

"Impossible. Absolutely impossible," the Daoist physician and midwife protested in unison.  

They were confident in their diagnosis. Though not cultivation masters, they were well-versed in matters of childbirth. Their methods—one observing visually, the other through pulse diagnosis—had led them to the same conclusion: the woman's meridians were tainted with sinister energy, her complexion dark. There was no doubt in their minds that she harbored an evil entity.  

Ignoring their objections, Xiao Ji channeled his meager spiritual energy to delve deeper into his perception.  

He needed to understand the relationship between the three entities and how they had reached this predicament.  

The others, seeing the Daoist's serious demeanor, remained silent, waiting. They hoped he could resolve the issue so they could collect their payment and leave.  

Lu Jinyin, sensing hope, waved for the maid who had brought food to leave.  

Soon, Xiao Ji pieced together the full picture.  

The infant spirit had once been raised by Physician Xue of the Child-Granting Temple in Longxiang County. While the physician was away, it had come into contact with a single-stringed pipa, which awakened dark thoughts and a sliver of intelligence within it. According to the spirit's memories, that pipa was Physician Xue's most prized possession.  

By chance, Madam Lu had traveled far to seek blessings at the temple, praying for a son since her husband desired a male heir.  

Seizing an opportunity when the physician's apprentice dozed off, the infant spirit possessed Madam Lu and fled the temple.  

Originally, it had planned to devour the fetus at full term and replace the newborn, achieving a twisted form of rebirth.  

But fate had other plans.  

The spirit had the misfortune of encountering an innate Dao Seed—a prodigy so rare that Willow Town had never seen its like before.  

When the Dao Seed awakened its consciousness in the womb, it discovered the parasitic spirit beside it. After a long period of dormancy, the two finally clashed, their struggle preventing the baby from being born.  

Though evenly matched, the Dao Seed, despite its innate wisdom, lacked guidance and could only rely on instinct to resist.  

This was a deadlock—whoever relented first would lose.  

Xiao Ji withdrew his fingers, frowning. "Unless we kill the infant spirit..."  

But the spirit and the fetus were locked in combat, and any violent movement could kill Madam Lu.  

"Daoist Xiao, what's the verdict?" Lu Jinyin asked urgently as Xiao Ji stepped back.  

How could he explain such an absurd situation?  

Xiao Ji stood, pacing briefly before speaking. "Well... the situation is somewhat complicated. Hypothetically speaking..."  

"I choose my wife," Lu Jinyin cut in firmly. "I choose her. I don't care about whatever's in her belly—I just want her alive and well, like before."  

Tears streamed from Madam Lu's eyes at his words.  

"Don't say that recklessly," Xiao Ji chided. "Your child has been in the womb for three and a half years—it can probably understand you. If it hasn't spoken, it's likely due to the circumstances. Think about your future."  

This fetus was an innate Dao Seed, destined for cultivation in a prestigious sect. If the child grew up resentful, the consequences would be dire.  

Now that the situation was clear, the next step was saving both mother and child.  

The onlookers watched quietly as Xiao Ji, who seemed somewhat capable, paced in thought.  

After considering his options, he devised a plan to ensure a safe delivery.  

Madam Lu groaned in pain, her condition worsening. Xiao Ji returned to her side, sensing the renewed struggle between the Dao Seed and the infant spirit. Each clash intensified her suffering.  

"Stop fighting!"  

He knew shouting was futile, but he did it anyway—mediation was a necessary first step before intervention.  

The others stared at him, bewildered.  

Xiao Ji then explained the situation inside the womb, omitting the more fantastical elements like the Dao Seed and framing it in more plausible terms.  

No one questioned the details.  

"Listen carefully," he addressed the Dao Seed. "The situation is complex, but hold on. We'll get you out soon."  

Once the fetus was stabilized, Xiao Ji turned to the sect cultivator present. "Lend me your low-grade Soul-Binding Rope. We'll use it to restrain the belly."  

The cultivator was startled—how did this Daoist know about his artifact?—but he complied.  

"Give me one Pain-Relief Talisman for her forehead," Xiao Ji instructed another Daoist. "Also prepare a Strength-Boosting Talisman and a Hemostasis Talisman. She'll need them after the spirit is dealt with."  

The Daoist was equally baffled at how Xiao Ji knew about his inventory.  

"Strong-armed warrior," Xiao Ji continued, "grip her hands firmly to prevent her from lashing out under the spirit's influence."  

"Fake monk, step back. Don't get in the way."  

"Midwife, prepare for delivery."  

Xiao Ji knew his current cultivation and skills were insufficient to ensure a safe birth alone. He needed everyone's cooperation.  

Finally, he approached the despondent Daoist physician. "Doctor, everything is ready. Take out your silver needles and pierce where I indicate."  

The physician paled, recalling the day he had accidentally killed a patient in Chaotou County. Back then, he had used needles to target an evil spirit inside a woman's womb—only for both the spirit and the mother to perish.  

The memory haunted him. Now, faced with the same task, he feared repeating history.  

Xiao Ji understood his hesitation, but the physician was the only one who could eliminate the infant spirit. Moreover, this was an opportunity for redemption.  

"If anything goes wrong, I, Xiao Ji, will take full responsibility."  

The reassurance worked.  

The physician inserted the needle into Madam Lu's abdomen, channeling a faint stream of spiritual energy. Dark energy surged up the needle, resisting.  

Sweat poured down the physician's face as he exerted all his strength.  

Inside, the infant spirit, already restrained by the Dao Seed, could not withstand the needle piercing its core.  

Though the sinister energy caused Madam Lu to convulse, the warrior held her firmly in place.  

A shrill scream echoed from her belly as the physician withdrew the needle, collapsing to the floor, drenched in sweat.  

With the spirit vanquished, the midwife sprang into action, ready to deliver the baby.  

Realizing the room was crowded with men, she quickly shooed them out, calling for maids to assist instead.  

Outside, the men waited with bated breath, eager to see what a child carried for three and a half years looked like.  

The air was cold, but their anticipation burned hot.  

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, a newborn's cry rang out from inside.  

Then, a voice—clear and articulate—spoke:  

"Mother, your child is unfilial for arriving so late."
