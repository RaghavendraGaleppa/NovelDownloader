# Chapter 36: Recruitment  

Three days later, Xiao Qing arrived at Courtyard Nine at the prearranged time to personally escort Han Yue to the trading house.  

Their conversation along the way was pleasant.  

Having handled all of Han Yue’s transactions over the past year, Xiao Qing’s performance had skyrocketed, and her status within the trading house had risen accordingly. Her position was now far from what it used to be!  

After all, the trading house was, at its core, a cultivation-oriented organization. Employees like Xiao Qing, who performed exceptionally, naturally received greater wealth and cultivation resources.  

With the resources provided by the trading house, Xiao Qing had advanced to the peak of the first rank, making her a cultivator of some standing in Fenrouji.  

When Han Yue inquired about the purpose of the meeting with the trading house master, Xiao Qing admitted she wasn’t entirely sure.  

They arrived at the tenth floor of the trading house—a place Han Yue had never been before.  

Led by Xiao Qing, they first passed through a grand banquet hall. She explained that this was the venue for the Dharma Assembly. The ceiling of the hall was made from a single, massive piece of crystal, polished to perfect transparency, offering an unobstructed view of the sky outside.  

After traversing the banquet hall, they walked through an open-air garden. At the very end stood a small, unassuming red-brick building—this was the residence of the trading house master.  

Xiao Qing remained at the entrance while Han Yue pushed the door open and stepped inside.  

The first thing that caught his eye was an enormous wooden screen, exquisitely carved from dense, high-quality wood—clearly no ordinary item.  

A deep, resonant voice came from behind the screen, warm and inviting:  

"Greetings, Master Han. Welcome to our humble establishment. I am Xu Yuan, the current master of this trading house."  

"Please, have a seat. Tea has already been prepared."  

"My apologies—I am currently unwell and must remain behind this screen, unable to meet you face-to-face. I hope you can understand."  

Xu Yuan began with an apology, demonstrating his sincerity.  

Han Yue, who always responded with courtesy to those who treated him with respect, replied:  

"You flatter me, Master Xu. Over this past period, I’ve also benefited greatly from your trading house’s support."  

"Might I ask why you’ve invited me here today?"  

Xu Yuan spoke:  

"First and foremost, I wished to express my gratitude. Your support over the past year has been invaluable to our trading house’s operations."  

"Secondly, regarding your previous request to exchange trading house currency for spirit stones—due to the substantial amount involved, we were unable to fulfill it at the time."  

"Now, we’ve prepared all the spirit stones you requested. You may take them with you when you leave."  

Han Yue nodded in acknowledgment and exchanged a few polite words with Xu Yuan.  

Xu Yuan continued:  

"Thirdly, I understand you intend to participate in our upcoming Dharma Assembly and are interested in competing for third-rank spiritual materials."  

"We’ve compiled a catalog of the confirmed materials that will appear at the assembly. Please feel free to take it with you for reference."  

As he finished speaking, a delicate young girl emerged from behind the screen and respectfully presented Han Yue with a gold-embroidered booklet.  

The catalog of spiritual materials was indeed of great interest to Han Yue. Having this information in advance would be crucial for his selection and purchase of materials.  

Xu Yuan’s words were carefully chosen, seemingly tailored entirely to Han Yue’s benefit.  

However, Han Yue was no stranger to social niceties. Xu Yuan’s apparent thoughtfulness was merely a prelude—there was undoubtedly more to come.  

Han Yue was curious to see what the man truly wanted.  

He cut straight to the point:  

"Master Xu has been most considerate. This catalog will be very useful. If there’s anything else you require, please don’t hesitate to say so."  

Xu Yuan chuckled. "Master Han sees clearly. I won’t beat around the bush—I do have a request."  

He spoke candidly:  

"Master Han, from your first transaction until now, we’ve collaborated for over two years."  

"Though this may not seem long, it has given us some understanding of each other."  

"I’d like to take this opportunity to formally invite you to join our trading house!"  

"Our trading house is commerce-oriented, striving for perfection in business dealings. However, when it comes to combat, our members are somewhat lacking."  

"But your talent in battle is truly exceptional. Everyone in our trading house admires your abilities!"  

"Rest assured—if you’re willing to join, I can place all our hunting and security teams under your command."  

"You would oversee the majority of our combat forces."  

"As for compensation, you needn’t worry. Our trading house is never short on funds. We can meet all your resource needs—even third-rank materials would be within your reach."  

"You may make any request, whether for personnel or materials, and we will fulfill it."  

"My only condition is that, under your leadership, the hunting teams maintain the same level of second-rank demon beast harvests as you’ve achieved over the past year."  

"To be frank, a stable supply of second-rank demon beast materials is immensely beneficial to our trading house. We’re willing to invest heavily to secure it."  

Han Yue was somewhat surprised. He hadn’t expected Xu Yuan’s request to be an offer of recruitment—and an exceedingly generous one at that!  

According to Xu Yuan, as long as Han Yue could ensure the supply of demon beasts, he would become a figure of real authority within the trading house and receive substantial rewards.  

However, Han Yue wasn’t particularly moved.  

He asked directly:  

"I appreciate your trust, Master Xu. But I have a few questions—if I may?"  

"Please, ask freely," Xu Yuan replied.  

"Does your trading house possess cultivation methods that lead directly to immortality?"  

Xu Yuan laughed. "Master Han jests. Our house has many secret methods for forming the Golden Core—even techniques for achieving a top-tier core are not lacking. But when it comes to methods for advancing beyond the third rank, our resources are limited."  

"Even in this vast realm, only a dozen or so top-tier factions possess methods that lead directly to immortality."  

"To seek the path of immortality, one must turn to those renowned sects."  

"Master Han’s aspirations are lofty, and I won’t presume to dissuade you. But I do have some heartfelt advice to share."  

"In the Jade Sky Realm, among countless mortals and innumerable cultivators, fewer than one in ten thousand manage to join a prestigious sect."  

"And even if one is fortunate enough to be accepted and taught immortal techniques, most end up as mere cannon fodder!"  

"For the majority of sect disciples, breaking through to the third rank is no easy feat."  

"As for attaining immortality and ascending to the fourth rank as a True Person? In the Jade Sky Realm, such an achievement occurs perhaps once in a millennium. The odds are vanishingly slim!"  

"Though Master Han’s ambitions are high, it wouldn’t hurt to remain grounded and focus on the present. Don’t you agree?"  

Xu Yuan’s perspective on cultivation was logical and well-reasoned. Han Yue couldn’t find fault with his argument.
