# Chapter 186: Sword Pavilion Walker

"Bring me the Shattered Star Crossbow!"

With a thunderous boom, Hong Baichuan leaped onto the city wall. Seeing the demon tiger below continuously destroying the scorching fire crossbows, he immediately abandoned any thought of engaging in close combat, halting his charging steps abruptly.

The sight was simply too terrifying. The farther away, the better.

Who knew if this demon beast carried some potent poison? Though its aura didn't seem particularly strong, this was his first encounter with a demon beast, so caution was naturally warranted.

He tore off his shirt, revealing incredibly robust muscles.

The muscles on Hong Baichuan's arms coiled like gnarled roots of an ancient tree as he single-handedly hoisted the mechanical siege crossbow that normally required layers of gears to operate.

Xu Yunfan recognized it as the "Mountain Crusher" model from Skyforge City. Its construction was extremely difficult. Over two months ago, it had pierced through the heavy armor of a Blood Transformation Realm expert from the Incense Fire Cult, pinning him to the ground.

If not for the Blood Transformation Realm expert's exceptionally powerful vitality, the Incense Fire Cult would have lost a major figure.

The bowstring hummed, shaking loose debris from the city bricks. The three-foot-long meteor iron arrow had just left the string when the Tiger Demon's Iron Bone right claw suddenly thrust forward. The tiger claw generated a three-foot-long azure glow that instantly collided with the oncoming meteor iron arrow.

Sparks from metal clashing illuminated the city wall. The arrowhead and the claw's azure glow remained locked in mid-air, the explosive gust of wind overturning the three mechanical beasts trying to approach below.

In the end, the Tiger Demon forcibly twisted the meteor iron arrow away, sending it blasting into a distant mountain, burying itself deep within.

"What a beast!"

Hong Baichuan's eyes widened in fury. Just as he was about to pull the second bowstring, a clear and resonant sword cry pierced the air from the northwest corner.

A white-robed swordsman floated onto the scene, stepping on the wreckage of mechanical beasts. A jade tablet at his waist was carved with the seal script for "Sword Pavilion."

Xu Yunfan noticed that the man's steps subtly aligned with the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, and with each landing, he precisely stepped on the blind spots of the mechanical beasts' joints, preventing any sudden movements from the wreckage.

"Pei Yan of the Great Zhou Sword Pavilion requests to slay this beast."

The green bamboo scabbard split apart with a sound, revealing the autumn-water-like narrow blade within.

The Tiger Demon seemed to sense the danger; its Iron Bone spine suddenly arched, and the half of its head protruding above the city wall immediately turned around.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan subconsciously loosened his grip on the hammer handle.

But then Pei Yan's wrist flicked lightly. Sword light, like a silver snake, spewed a three-foot sword beam and instantly pierced into the Tiger Demon's body.

Xu Yunfan watched clearly. With each tremble of the sword tip, it struck precisely at the muscle connection points of the Tiger Demon. After thirteen crisp sounds, the muscle connections in many parts of the massive tiger's body shattered section by section.

The Tiger Demon retreated violently seven steps, its claws scraping sparks from the city wall.

Pei Yan, however, was like a shadow following form, his sword tip always staying three inches from the demon's throat.

Xu Yunfan suddenly realized the swordsman's breathing technique was extremely unique. Each breath synchronized perfectly with the rhythm of the gears from the mechanical beast wreckage, seemingly turning the entire battlefield into an extension of his breathing.

"Got it!"

As the sword light flared, the Tiger Demon's left claw suddenly raised its Azure Mist Blade. Countless wind blades, clearly visible to the naked eye, formed by condensed air pressure, shot forth instantly, capable of easily piercing stone and metal.

Like a torrential rain, they shot towards him. Yet Pei Yan had already turned half a step earlier, his form like a falling leaf drifting with the wind, not taking a single hit.

Pei Yan's green bamboo sword pierced the Tiger Demon's throat as easily as stabbing tofu.

The great demon, which had forcibly emerged early due to the Ginseng Baby and hadn't even gathered much demonic energy, died such a frustratingly pathetic death at the hands of a martial artist.

As the fatal strike landed, the hourglass on the city wall happened to run out its last grain of sand.

A Divine Weapon!

A Muscle Refining Realm expert.

Whether he could win or not would have to be tested in a fight.

Moreover, the other party actually managed to get a Divine Weapon to recognize him as its master at this realm...

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered. He watched the long sword at Pei Yan's waist flow for a good while. Taking advantage of no one noticing, he quietly slipped off the city wall, preparing to sprint towards the Earthfire Room in the Casting Hall. He had important matters to attend to and naturally couldn't linger on the wall for too long.

In a place no one noticed, Qi Huan静静地看着 (watched silently as) Xu Yunfan's rapidly departing figure, his gaze fixed intently on the object in Xu Yunfan's hand, concealed by his clothes.

His fingers trembled unconsciously, and the veins on his neck pulsed up and down.

The thing inside... was incredibly important to him!

Pei Yan sheathed his sword with fluid grace. Only a master like Xu Yunfan could see that the little finger of his sword-wielding right hand was twitching slightly. The move "Severing the River and Cutting the Flow" had actually exhausted all the clever strength in that hand. However, his swordsmanship was so superb that he could still kill the Tiger Demon with a few seemingly effortless strikes.

Hong Baichuan clapped his hands and laughed: "What a splendid move, 'Nineteen Star-Piercing Strikes'! If Meng Tianjiao knew in the underworld, he would surely regret refusing the Sword Pavilion's invitation back then. It seems with you, Nephew Pei, the current generation's Sword Pavilion Walker is truly the first among the youth."

Pei Yan lowered his eyes and stroked the green bamboo scabbard, his thumb rubbing the shallow scratch left by the tiger claw's wind pressure. Although this scabbard wasn't a Divine Weapon, it was still a genuine treasure capable of nurturing a weapon.

His heart ached, but on the surface, Pei Yan smiled.

"You flatter me too much, Senior Hong."

He turned to look at the Tiger Demon's corpse below. The morning light refracted a seven-star halo on the Sword Pavilion jade tablet.

"Back when Senior Meng used the Azure Mist Sword to clear the water bandits of three provinces, I hadn't even started my studies. To be able to slay this beast today, I truly relied on your sect's mechanical beasts to exhaust seventy percent of its ferocity first."

"Nephew Pei, there's no need for modesty. The Sword Pavilion grows stronger with each generation. With the world's spiritual energy reviving somewhat, you will likely break through to higher realms in the future. As for our Skyforge Cave, we are much thinner in numbers now."

Seeing Hong Baichuan's face full of lament, Pei Yan, being young at heart, finally showed a trace of a smile. The heartache over the mark on his scabbard eased considerably.

"You speak too highly, Senior Hong. I merely relied on the advantage of a Divine Weapon. Otherwise, killing this demon would have required much more effort. I came to Skyforge Cave this time naturally to request a weapon, but I ended up showing off my slight skills before an expert."

"Nephew Pei possesses a Sword Bone gifted by nature. To have a Divine Weapon recognize you is your own ability..."

"..."

The green bricks below the city wall transmitted a faint tremor. While collecting the scorching fire crossbows, Xu Yunfan was passing through the drainage gate of the western瓮城 (walled enclosure).

He looked up at the thirty-zhang high city wall. Laughter and conversation from under the eaves of the glazed tiles drifted down with the morning wind.

"Sword Pavilion Walker... First among the youth... Heh..."

Xu Yunfan had no particular reaction. His mind was entirely focused on rushing into the Casting Platform in the Earthfire Room. His boots left the city wall's range, and he had already turned into a shadow shooting towards the Earthfire Room built of black basalt in the west of the city.

The Casting Hall disciple guarding the door of the Earthfire Room only felt a wave of heat rush past his throat. Just as he reached for the copper bell at his waist to sound an alarm, he found that the three meteor iron bolts had already been dropped.

"It's me."

Xu Yunfan's voice came, causing the disciple at the Casting Platform to pause his movements.

The three-hundred-zhang spiral iron staircase turned into a whip of flame beneath Xu Yunfan's feet.

The deeper he went, the redder the soles of his玄铁 (Black Iron) boots became. Even through three layers of tanned cowhide, he could feel the licking of the fire from the earth's core.
