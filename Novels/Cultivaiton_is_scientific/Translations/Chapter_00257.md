# Chapter 257: The Patriarch

Returning to the gates of the Shu Mountain Sect, Li Shiming thanked Elder Zhao before heading to his master, Elder Su.

Almost as soon as he arrived at the sect's entrance, Elder Su had sent him a message, instructing him to come immediately.

"Master, your disciple has returned!" Li Shiming arrived at the summit of Tianmu Peak and saw Elder Su waiting for him. He quickly stepped forward and bowed.

"Follow me!" Elder Su's expression was stern, but Li Shiming could sense his master's underlying satisfaction. Though his face was serious, his eyes held a trace of approval.

Li Shiming followed Elder Su as they flew toward the rear of the sect, soon arriving at a mountain peak.

Elder Su cast a spell inward, a process that felt familiar to Li Shiming—it was the same method his clone, Li Yuanba, had witnessed when Sword Elder visited Patriarch Lu.

Given Elder Su's status, such a formal visit likely meant they were meeting a patriarch.

"This must be Patriarch Fan's cave abode," Li Shiming guessed inwardly.

It wasn't hard to deduce. Earlier, when Li Shiming had encountered the Venerable Huike, Patriarch Fan had spoken up on his behalf, driving Huike away.

Li Shiming finally met Patriarch Fan. The patriarch had a head of white hair and a ruddy complexion. He sat at a stone table laden with food, eating heartily and drinking large gulps of wine.

This sight made Li Shiming pause—he hadn't expected Patriarch Fan to have such an appearance.

"Master, I've brought some spirit wine as an offering for you." Elder Su seemed accustomed to Patriarch Fan's demeanor. Smiling, he placed a bottle of wine on the stone table.

Li Shiming didn't dare act so casually. He bowed deeply and remained in that position.

"Enough, stand up. In the future, just bring me good wine—that's better than any bow." Patriarch Fan waved his hand, and an invisible force straightened Li Shiming's posture.

Patriarch Fan opened the wine Elder Su had brought, poured a cup, and took a sip before nodding in satisfaction.

Though Li Shiming didn't dare use his divine sense, the aroma of the wine told him it was only second-grade spirit wine.

Of course, the quality of spirit wine wasn't solely determined by its grade—flavor played a significant role. The wine Elder Su had gifted, though second-grade, was clearly a meticulously crafted top-tier variety.

"Your disciple-grandson understands." Sensing Patriarch Fan's casual nature, Li Shiming relaxed slightly and smiled.

Elder Su chuckled beside him. He knew his master's temperament well.

In truth, every Nascent Soul Patriarch had their quirks. After all, with lifespans stretching a thousand years, they had seen everything the world had to offer.

---

Nascent Soul Patriarchs needed ways to pass the time. Moreover, as the pinnacle of power in the Northern Shu region, they faced few restrictions on their desires and actions. This freedom allowed them to indulge in their instincts.

This was also a form of cultivation—following one's true nature and tempering the mind.

Patriarch Fan spent about an hour eating and drinking, with Elder Su refilling his cup like a dutiful son in the mortal world.

"You're Li Shiming, aren't you? You've got too many little schemes," Patriarch Fan remarked after finishing his meal, his gaze sweeping over Li Shiming as he shook his head.

"Master, Shiming is a good child. If not for him bringing back spirit herbs from the Hundred Thousand Mountains, my injuries might have hindered my path!" Elder Su was the one who reacted most strongly to Patriarch Fan's words, immediately defending Li Shiming.

Li Shiming, too, looked at Patriarch Fan in confusion, unsure why he had received such an evaluation.

"I didn't say he wasn't a good child—just that he's got too many little schemes." Patriarch Fan waved Elder Su off before pointing at Li Shiming and asking, "As his master, you really don't know much. Last time, you told me he had just reached the mid-stage of Foundation Building. Now he's already at the late-stage, and you didn't even notice?"

Elder Su whirled around to stare at Li Shiming, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Foundation Building wasn't like Qi Refining. While sufficient resources could accelerate progress in Qi Refining, each stage in Foundation Building required meticulous refinement of spiritual energy, compressing it to its limits—a process that demanded considerable time. Accumulating spiritual energy in the spiritual lake alone could take anywhere from a few years to several decades per stage.

Had Li Shiming's aura been unstable, Elder Su would have noticed. But his disciple's aura was exceptionally steady, indicating a well-consolidated foundation.

What surprised Elder Su even more was that Li Shiming had concealed his true cultivation level, appearing only at the mid-stage when he had already reached the late-stage.

"Before joining my tutelage, Shiming traveled alone from Tianhai Island to the Northern Shu Continent, passing through the Hundred Thousand Mountains. It's only natural for him to be cautious," Elder Su continued to defend him.

"Shiming, as my disciple-grandson and under the protection of the Shu Mountain Sect, there's no need to hide your cultivation level. I understand your concerns—the cultivation world is full of fortuitous encounters. Whatever opportunity allowed you to reach late-stage Foundation Building so quickly, you needn't fear interrogation. Every Nascent Soul cultivator in our sect's history has had their own secrets. If the sect lacked the tolerance for that, it would have collapsed long ago." Patriarch Fan smiled at Li Shiming.

"Your disciple-grandson will remember your teachings." Li Shiming bowed respectfully.

He deactivated the *Shadow Demon Buddha Physique Technique*, allowing his aura to return to normal.

"Master, during my journey, I obtained third-grade spirit tea from Ji Hongbo's storage bracelet. I was already at the peak of mid-stage Foundation Building, and after drinking the tea, I advanced directly to the late-stage. I wouldn't dare deceive you." He turned to Elder Su and explained with another bow.

"See? He's blessed with profound fortune!" Elder Su beamed at Patriarch Fan.

"Indeed, his fortune runs deep. Ji Hongbo is Little Ji's son, right? Since when did Little Ji become so generous as to give third-grade spirit tea to his son?" Patriarch Fan mused.

"Judging by the timing, it was around the period when third-grade spirit tea is distributed every three years. Ji Hongbo probably collected it on behalf of Elder Ji but hadn't yet delivered it to his father before he went after Shiming." Elder Su couldn't hide his delight.

Elder Ji had always targeted him, and while Elder Su had retaliated, his countermeasures had only affected sect interests, not Elder Ji's personal resources.

Each Golden Core Elder received a small portion of third-grade spirit tea every three years, based on their status within the sect.

This tea was typically reserved for esteemed guests, especially for Golden Core Elders with real authority. Serving third-grade spirit tea symbolized respect and a desire to forge closer ties—an unspoken rule.

But Elder Ji had lost three years' worth of tea, meaning he couldn't entertain guests with it during that period. This was an awkward situation to explain and might strain his relationships with old allies.

"Now that Shiming has reached late-stage Foundation Building, pass on my message: Little Ji is to relinquish a set of Golden Core breakthrough resources. If he refuses, I'll personally visit his master, Old Zuo." Patriarch Fan made his decision with a wave.

Fair competition between factions within the sect was one thing, but conspiring with outsiders to assassinate a fellow disciple was another matter entirely.

Though Ji Hongbo had been crippled, Elder Ji, as his father, had to bear the consequences.

Patriarch Zuo and Patriarch Fan were both Nascent Soul cultivators of the Shu Mountain Sect. Normally, they would remain aloof from the struggles of their juniors.

But Elder Ji's attempt on Li Shiming's life had escalated beyond factional rivalry—it had harmed the sect's interests.

---

Li Shiming was a true inheritor of alchemy. The fact that the Thousand Leaves Temple had sent the Arhat Zhikong was proof of his importance—Li Shiming had stopped refining pills for them.

This demonstrated that even before becoming a full-fledged alchemy master, Li Shiming's influence was significant.

For a sect to have such a talented alchemist targeted by one of its own was unacceptable to all factions. Without adequate compensation, the matter wouldn't be settled.

Patriarch Zuo's faction hadn't yet distributed their Golden Core breakthrough resources for the next decade, unlike Patriarch Fan's faction, which had already allocated theirs to Li Shiming's senior sister, Ye Jingxian.

Originally, they had planned to rely on Elder Ma to secure breakthrough resources. But since Li Shiming was Elder Su's disciple (while only nominally Elder Ma's), having Elder Ma provide the resources would have embarrassed Elder Su.

"Shiming, thank your grandmaster!" Elder Su prompted with a smile.

"Thank you, Grandmaster!" Li Shiming knew this was a boon. Though he already had one set of breakthrough resources, who would complain about having more?

The breakthrough resources from the Netherworld Sect and the Shu Mountain Sect differed not only in the knowledge they encompassed but also in the ingredients used for the Meridian Protection Pill, Spirit Stabilizing Pill, Revival Pill, and Mountain-Sundering Pill—despite sharing the same names and effects.

"The Thousand Leaves Temple sent Arhat Zhikong. Since you weren't in the sect, we negotiated on your behalf and secured an inheritance opportunity. Of course, the sect also received considerable benefits, which will be converted into contribution points for you.

"The inheritance is for the *Divine Eye Insight*. You'll only have one chance to receive it, so it's best to wait until you reach the Golden Core stage." Patriarch Fan spoke slowly, watching Li Shiming.

Li Shiming understood that, as two of the three great orthodox sects, the Thousand Leaves Temple and the Shu Mountain Sect couldn't afford to truly feud.

Still, he was pleased to hear about the inheritance opportunity. Had he negotiated personally, he might have only received a few Foundation Building-grade artifacts or spirit herbs as compensation.

Could he really oppose the Thousand Leaves Temple alone? His earlier threat—refusing to refine pills for them—might seem simple, but if it truly hindered the temple's development, they might eliminate him entirely.

"Shiming will follow the sect's arrangements." He bowed.

"Little Ma said you're destined to become an alchemy master, so I'll grant you some privileges in advance. The spiritual vein at your Swordholding Peak will be upgraded to Golden Core grade to aid your cultivation." Patriarch Fan, satisfied with Li Shiming's compliance, smiled as he made the decision.

---

Li Shiming expressed his gratitude once more.

"Oh, and since you used a *Ten-Thousand-Mile Escape Talisman*, the Thousand Leaves Temple sent three *Buddha Light Ten-Thousand-Mile Talismans* as compensation. Take them." Patriarch Fan retrieved three talismans from his person and tossed them to Li Shiming.

Li Shiming had nearly forgotten about the talisman he'd used. Securing the *Divine Eye Insight* inheritance already felt like a win.

Now, with three replacement talismans, he was even more pleased—though such life-saving measures weren't critical to him.

His true escape technique wasn't the *Ten-Thousand-Mile Escape Talisman* but the beginner divine ability *Lotus Steps*.

After leaving Patriarch Fan's abode, Elder Su instructed Li Shiming to return to Swordholding Peak, as Lai Fei, the chief manager of the Northern Shu Trading Company, would soon visit in person.

Unlike Cai Hong, who had needed Elder Su's introduction to meet Li Shiming, Lai Fei held a much higher status. Elder Su's tone when mentioning him suggested that Lai Fei had significant backing.

Now that Li Shiming had established his own standing, he could handle such matters independently.

Upon returning to Swordholding Peak, Li Shiming immediately sensed the change in spiritual energy.

At the summit, the difference was subtle, but inside his cave abode—especially in the cultivation chamber—the spiritual energy at the vein's source had risen to Golden Core grade, matching Elder Su's Tianmu Peak.

Though the Shu Mountain Sect's spiritual energy was supplied through veins, it was regulated by the sect's grand formation.

Spiritual energy was a finite resource, and the sect strictly controlled its distribution. Even if the main vein had surplus energy, it wouldn't be fully allocated to individual abodes.

The main vein couldn't be exploited recklessly—it required constant maintenance through the grand formation and spiritual materials, ensuring a balanced consumption ratio.

Now, Swordholding Peak's spiritual energy no longer drew from Elder Su's Tianmu Peak vein but was directly connected to the main vein. This adjustment, executed via the grand formation, had likely been completed before Li Shiming's return, with Patriarch Fan merely formalizing the notification.

As Li Shiming basked in the Golden Core-grade spiritual energy of his own peak, he knew this marked his rising status within the sect—now on par with a Golden Core cultivator.
