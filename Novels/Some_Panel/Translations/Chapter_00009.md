## Chapter Nine: Choice One

Yang Ji simply glanced at the three rooms but didn't immediately move in. Instead, he turned and exited the small courtyard.

With a thousand spirit stones in hand, he finally had his first pot of gold. Although he hadn't found any treasures on Heavenly Water Island, he had seen quite a few good items at the scattered stalls when he first arrived in Southwind City that day. He decided to go back and investigate. If he could find one or two more treasures and double his thousand spirit stones, that would be for the best.

With this thought, Yang Ji had walked from the city's edge to its center, where a wide main street, capable of accommodating ten carriages abreast, stretched out. The main street was the most bustling, a scene of endless prosperity and vibrancy. Crowds bustled along the street, and carriages flowed like water. Shops lined both sides of the avenue, with numerous scattered stalls beside them, cries of vendors rising and falling. This was also where cultivators congregated most, with no less than thirty visible at a glance.

Yang Ji quite liked this atmosphere, and he immediately began to browse the scattered stalls. He inquired about the "Silver Spirit Fruit seeds" and "Immortal Spirit Peach saplings" he had seen before. However, the sellers of these rare treasures recognized their value, so their prices were firm: one demanded fifteen hundred spirit stones, the other two thousand, refusing to budge. Left with no choice, Yang Ji could only move on to other stalls.

He also spotted the old fellow selling the Deep Sea Sunken Stone, who was the most absurd. The surface of that sunken stone looked like an extraordinary ore, yet he insisted on a price of three thousand spirit stones, refusing to budge, even confidently claiming it was Profound Iron ore. Ignorance itself isn't terrible; what's terrible is ignorance coupled with a high asking price. Yang Ji watched as the old fellow repeatedly struck the sunken stone with his low-grade dharma artifact, sparks flying and clanging sounds attracting quite a few cultivators. If he were to truly cleave it open and reveal its interior, what would his reaction be? He'd probably lose face on the spot.

Yang Ji shook his head with a smile, withdrew his gaze, and turned to other stalls.

"Fellow Daoist, interested in spirit talismans?" Seeing Yang Ji's gaze, a kind-faced old cultivator immediately smiled at him.

"What kind of spirit talismans do you have? And what grade?" Yang Ji crouched down and asked.

"I only have low-tier mid-grade Fire Dragon Talismans here. They are drawn using the blood of a Level Six Flame Serpent combined with my fire-attribute spiritual energy. Once activated, the talisman will transform into a several-zhang-long Flame Serpent that fiercely lunges out, possessing immense power. A single talisman can heavily injure a Level Six demonic beast with ease. Each talisman costs seventy spirit stones, no bargaining. Would Fellow Daoist like two?" The old man said unhurriedly.

Yang Ji observed the talisman's surface, where a faint fiery glow flickered and spiritual energy was dense. It was indeed a genuine low-tier mid-grade spirit talisman. After obtaining the old man's permission, he reached out to take the talisman, preparing to examine it closely.

The moment the spirit talisman landed in his hand, he felt a warmth. Though seemingly thin, the talisman was surprisingly weighty, as if a Level Six Flame Serpent was sealed within. He could feel the vast spiritual energy contained within slowly flowing. Such a talisman could indeed cause some damage to Level Four to Level Six demonic beasts, but it wouldn't be fatal. Selling it for seventy-one was truly expensive. Yet, the old man maintained a calm, unhurried demeanor, stating a fixed price, clearly not worried about selling it. Yang Ji couldn't help but sigh, these Talisman Masters were truly formidable. To be able to draw a few strokes on talisman paper worth a few spirit stones and sell it for a high price of seventy—they truly deserved their reputation as one of the more profitable professions among the Hundred Arts of Cultivation. He found himself contemplating whether he should also buy some books on talismanship in the future and learn to draw them himself.

"Fellow Daoist, how about two?" The old man gently smiled when he saw Yang Ji lost in thought, staring at the talisman.

Yang Ji shook his head and put the talisman down. Spirit talismans were still too luxurious for him at the moment. A thousand spirit stones were not enough for him to spend carelessly; he needed to be frugal and use them on what was most beneficial to him right now. After giving the old man a polite smile, Yang Ji stood up and turned to other stalls.

He saw many rare items at various stalls, but which cultivator present wasn't a shrewd individual? They had lived longer than Yang Ji and possessed broader knowledge than he did, making it quite difficult to unearth genuine treasures. Yang Ji browsed every single stall but failed to find anything suitable for purchase, which was somewhat disappointing.

Just as he was about to leave, his gaze inadvertently fell upon a young boy. The boy had just set up his stall, laying out several bottles of pills. Pills? Yang Ji's heart stirred, and he immediately walked up to the boy, smiling as he asked, "Fellow Daoist, what kind of pills are in these five bottles in front of you?"

The boy, fair-skinned and tender, seemed young and inexperienced. Seeing a customer approach him right after he set up, he enthusiastically looked at Yang Ji and pointed to the bottles, introducing them: "Fellow Daoist, these first four bottles contain spirit pills for advancing cultivation: the Linghua Pill, Qi-gathering Pill, Yellow Dragon Pill, and Foundation Cultivation Pill. Among them, the Linghua Pill is the best, being a superior-grade low-tier spirit pill. As for the bottle at the back, it contains Quieting Heart Pills, which can help one quickly enter a meditative state."

Hearing the boy's tender voice, many cultivators cast curious glances. Perhaps thinking the boy looked young, naive, and easy to fool, quite a few cultivators immediately gathered around.

"Young friend, how many spirit stones per bottle for this Linghua Pill?" A middle-aged cultivator casually asked.

"Five hundred spirit stones per bottle. Each bottle contains five pills and can sustain a Qi Condensation cultivator's cultivation for half a month," the boy replied with a smile.

"Five hundred spirit stones a bottle? That's too expensive!" The inquiring middle-aged cultivator found his opening, intentionally pulled a long face, and frowned, "This Linghua Pill is just a low-tier spirit pill, worth at most two hundred spirit stones a bottle, yet you're asking for five hundred. Didn't your elders tell you anything before you left home?"

The middle-aged cultivator's gaze carried a faint pressuring intensity, like an elder questioning a junior, his imposing aura making it seem as if an ordinary young boy would stammer and believe he was wrong. However, the boy, who was only about ten years old, replied with an unchanged expression, "There are also low-tier spirit pills that cost two hundred spirit stones a bottle, you see? Like these Yellow Dragon Pills and Foundation Cultivation Pills." He pointed to the two small porcelain bottles in front of him.

"They're all low-tier spirit pills, why such a huge price difference?" The middle-aged cultivator demanded, his face stern.

"Exactly, why such a big difference? Did you get it wrong, little one?" Other cultivators, hoping to gain something from the situation, also chimed in with a hardened tone, creating an impression of collective condemnation.

"My Master said that the quality of this bottle of Linghua Pills is superior. They contain fewer impurities and have excellent medicinal effects," the boy explained, his expression unchanged and utterly guileless. "As for the Yellow Dragon Pills and Foundation Cultivation Pills, while they are also low-tier spirit pills, their quality is only inferior, containing more impurities." He added, "If you don't believe me, just open one and see for yourselves."

"Superior quality low-tier spirit pills? You're quite young, yet you've learned to con people?" The middle-aged cultivator lightly admonished, picked up a pill bottle, and disdainfully pulled out the stopper. Upon smelling it, a hint of unusual color, barely perceptible to others, flashed in his eyes. He glanced at the boy, then focused his gaze into the bottle, examining it carefully. Three breaths later, he frowned slightly and said, "The pill fragrance is indeed potent, suggesting the medicinal potency is very well preserved. But to call this superior quality, I think it's still lacking. There are still impurities; it's at most mid-grade quality."
