# Chapter 2: Undying!

On the skeleton altar stood a half-meter-tall, pitch-black platform. Light around it seemed to twist, and the platform itself was densely covered with intricate runes. Floating above it was a fist-sized mass of milky-white, flowing liquid, emitting a faint white glow. Its sacred aura felt utterly out of place in this environment.

In front of the platform stood two figures, completely shrouded in black robes. One of them extended an arm like withered wood, holding a black box adorned with purple cloud patterns. He opened the box, revealing a white lining inside. Upon closer inspection, a single black, curved hair lay upon it.

A hoarse, grating voice, like fingernails scraping against glass, emanated from beneath the robe…

"This is Zhou Tian's hair. We lost several members just to obtain it. Do you have confidence?"

The other black-robed figure took the box and replied, "Zhou Tian is the only member of the Great Qin Imperial Family with no cultivation base. He receives the least protection from Dragon's Luck. If we can't even curse him to death, then all our efforts will have been in vain."

After scrutinizing the hair in the box, he asked curiously, "I've never heard that Zhou Tian's hair is curved."

The other black-robed figure's body stiffened. After a moment of silence, he said, "This isn't his hair…"

"…"

The black-robed figure holding the box didn't press the question. If it wasn't hair, what other part of the body would have such long strands? The implication was obvious, and asking would only disgust him.

A dark, black energy enveloped the hair in the box, placing it into the irregularly flowing white liquid. A wondrous scene unfolded.

The white liquid flared with bright light. Faint, ethereal chanting echoed in the void, and a white lotus blossomed, sacred and noble, exuding a refreshing fragrance that permeated the air.

Deep within the lotus, a human-shaped phantom slowly formed. Its face gradually became clear, revealing Zhou Tian's likeness, though his eyes remained closed. A golden dragon's shadow encircled him, its majestic roar causing the white lotus to tremble.

"This is the essence of the Heavenly Blood Divine Lotus, capable of gathering divine souls and even resurrecting the dead. To waste it here…" one of the black-robed figures said, his voice tinged with anguish. The Heavenly Blood Divine Lotus was an invaluable treasure. It could gather a person's divine soul using their blood or hair, and even revive those who had recently died, enough to serve as the foundation of a sect. Yet here, it was merely used to establish a connection with Zhou Tian's divine soul, pointlessly wasting much of its miraculous power.

"Enough, don't lament it. Prepare to begin. If we succeed, none of this will matter."

The other black-robed figure unleashed a series of eerie and unpredictable rune seals towards the pitch-black platform. Seeing this, the second black-robed figure beside him surged with energy and likewise cast a series of rune seals.

The pitch-black platform glowed, and the intricate runes carved upon it seemed to flow. Runes surged out, covering the skeleton platform, then spreading to encompass the entire grand formation.

The grand formation began to operate, its patterns emitting a ghastly green light as countless vengeful spirits howled.

The rune seals cast by the black-robed figures grew faster and faster. A chill wind blew away their hoods, revealing two skull-like heads, their faces deathly pale, as drops of sweat dripped down.

Within the formation, countless vengeful spirits began to tear at each other. Innumerable torture instruments appeared out of thin air, lashing their bodies. Streaks of black energy were extracted by the black runes covering the entire formation—the concentrated agony, fury, resentment, and all negative emotions of the spirits.

On the rune-covered platform, a pitch-black, needle-shaped phantom began to appear, gradually solidifying.

The vengeful spirits gradually dwindled, replaced by increasingly powerful ones, from whom even more black energy surged forth. Finally, a colossal spirit, a thousand zhang tall, composed of countless other spirits, appeared. Its negative emotions were so overwhelming that merely glancing at it caused dizziness.

Innumerable black runes swarmed onto its body, dense as tadpoles. The thousand-zhang-tall body began to contract, squeezing out countless ghastly white wisps—unnecessary elements. In less than a breath, the colossal spirit was entirely absorbed by the black runes.

All the black runes began to recede. As the last one entered the platform, a tangible, black needle took shape. Its surface appeared perfectly smooth, but if magnified ten thousand times, one would see countless hideous phantoms of vengeful spirits within it.

"Success or failure hinges on this!"

The two black-robed figures exchanged a glance. Their energy surged, runes erupted, and immense malevolent aura emanated as they controlled the black needle, sending it piercing towards the Zhou Tian in the white lotus.

Wherever the black needle passed, the white lotus transformed into a black one. Hideous human faces emerged on its petals, howling, desperate to escape.

The golden dragon's shadow circling Zhou Tian seemed to sense something. It let out a long roar, twisting its body and moving towards the black needle.

The black needle was unassuming, but its corrupting power was immense. The golden dragon's shadow had barely touched it when a flicker of black appeared in its eyes. After resisting for only a moment, the entire dragon shadow turned black, its eyes now glowing with malevolent light, and it turned back towards Zhou Tian.

"It really works!"

Seeing this, the two black-robed figures revealed looks of delight. This black needle was formed from human negative emotions, the purest evil, capable of counteracting Dragon's Luck, which was similarly composed of the collective thoughts of all beings.

With the dragon shadow's obstruction gone, the black needle plunged directly into "Zhou Tian's" forehead. The "Zhou Tian" with closed eyes suddenly opened them, revealing eyes completely black.

With a 'bang,' the phantom exploded, leaving behind only a sea of black lotus flowers.

"Excellent!"

"It's a success!"

Two excited voices rang out. However, in the deepest part of the black lotus sea, unseen by them, a white light struggled to coalesce for a moment before dissipating due to a lack of power. This indicated that the divine soul connected to it had appeared again.

…

As for Zhou Tian, he was walking when suddenly his vision went dark. His body felt weak, and he stumbled backward. Before losing consciousness, a voice seemed to ring out in his mind.

"Undying System activated. Death count increased by one…"

When he regained consciousness, he was already in a room. Voices reached his ears:

"…So Young Master Zhou is merely exhausted, and there's nothing serious. Look… he's awake now, King Qin, please rest assured."

Zhou Tian was helped up from the bed. Before him stood a group of people. One was a tall, stern-faced middle-aged man, currently looking worried. This was his father, Zhou Yi, the King of Qin of the Great Qin Empire, a powerful figure with glorious military achievements.

Behind his father was the old man who had called him awake—the Zhou Manor's butler. Including Zhou Tian, he had served three generations of the Zhou family. No one seemed to know his actual name; everyone, even Zhou Tian's father, simply called him Uncle Zhou.

An old man sat by the bed, three fingers resting on Zhou Tian's wrist, occasionally tapping it. Each tap would send a white rune into his body. The words he had just heard came from this old man.

There was also a white-haired middle-aged man he didn't recognize, accompanied by a young girl. She had sparkling eyes, a slightly upturned nose, snow-white skin, a slender neck, and a waist that seemed too thin to grasp. Dressed in a purple dress, her creamy-white thighs were exposed. Her chest was rather flat. She was looking at him now, with an indescribable expression in her eyes.
