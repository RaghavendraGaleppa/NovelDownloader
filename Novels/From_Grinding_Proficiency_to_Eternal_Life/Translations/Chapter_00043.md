# Chapter 43: The Statue of the Power-Awakened Bodhisattva

Xu Yunfan ignored the eunuch who harbored ambitions of becoming the Wheel-Turning King. Instead, he reached into the box and pulled out a bizarre wooden statue of a three-headed, eight-armed Bodhisattva.

He didn't use his hands but picked it up with a pair of chopsticks.

The statue was carved with exquisite detail. Its face bore a smile that wasn't quite a smile, exuding an elusive, mysterious charm.

What caught Xu Yunfan's attention most were the eyes. Like the finishing touch that brings a dragon to life, they were deep and vivid, as if they had breathed a living soul into the wooden carving.

The three faces of the Bodhisattva each displayed a different emotion.

One face was filled with rage, its eyes wide and furious.

Another was serene and tranquil, its expression calm.

The third had its hair standing on end in fury, its brows tightly knit.

The eight arms were thick with coiled muscles, bulging powerfully. Each muscle seemed to contain boundless strength, stacked like layers of armor. Although the Bodhisattva sat in a lotus position, its poised stance suggested it could leap up and strike at any moment.

"You have encountered an omen."

"The figure visualized through your cultivation of the Lin Character Mantra seems to have reacted. The ominous aura has been digested, and the proficiency of the Lin Character Mantra has increased."

Watching the information prompts silently appear in his vision, Xu Yunfan's hand trembled uncontrollably.

If the second message hadn't popped up in time, he would have thrown the eight-armed, three-headed Bodhisattva statue away in disgust.

"What is this thing?"

"It's not a 'thing'!"

Qin Bo looked at the wooden Bodhisattva statue held by the chopsticks, a sneer and a flicker of excitement crossing his face, before his expression turned pious once more.

"The Three-Bodied, Eight-Armed Power-Awakened Bodhisattva of Calamity, who displays compassion amidst suffering and disaster. The masses are often trapped in calamity, lost in confusion and unable to break free. The Bodhisattva wields divine power, using its immense fleshly might to disperse the gloom, shatter the shackles of the predicament, and help the masses escape the sea of suffering."

As he spoke, he raised his head to look at Xu Yunfan, a strange smile on his face, as if sharing a secret he had kept for a long time.

"Since I couldn't find a method for limb regeneration through medicine or secret techniques, then worshiping a true deity is not a bad alternative. Ever since I began worshiping the Power-Awakened Bodhisattva, my body has started to change. In three years, the flesh below my waist has grown back a little."

Xu Yunfan's curiosity was instantly piqued. He took a few steps forward, his eyes filled with inquiry. "Come on, let me see."

"What are you doing? Don't touch me, stop it! What do you want to do?!"

Qin Bo panicked, struggling desperately to avoid him.

With a tearing sound of fabric, Xu Yunfan had already leaned in for a look.

"It really has grown a bit longer!"

Xu Yunfan exclaimed in astonishment, but his heart grew even heavier.

He had a vague feeling that this seemingly familiar world of martial arts was hiding deeper secrets, far more complex than he had imagined.

If there were extreme practitioners seeking the traces of immortals and the path to eternal life, then the existence of gods and Buddhas didn't seem entirely without reason.

"Where did this come from?" Xu Yunfan pressed.

As he spoke, he stood up and released Qin Bo. Qin Bo, seeing this, hurriedly and clumsily tried to cover himself.

"Jiyun Mountain, Thousand Buddha Temple. It's one of the Bodhisattvas enshrined inside."

A trace of fanaticism flashed in Qin Bo's eyes, and he spoke with undisguised eagerness.

"Since you have already come into contact with the Power-Awakened Bodhisattva, then we are of the same path. This ability to regenerate flesh can even rewrite your martial arts aptitude. I can teach you how to do it. Why don't you untie me quickly?"

Xu Yunfan slowly stood up, ignoring Qin Bo's words, and walked into the room to fetch a long-handled wooden mallet.

This was originally a tool used by laborers for driving stakes or repairing houses. He had bought it back to use for his daily practice of the Cloak Hammer.

He walked slowly to Qin Bo's side. Under the other's horrified gaze, Xu Yunfan swung the hammer down hard.

*Thump!*

With a muffled sound, Qin Bo's entire head, like a watermelon smashed by a heavy hammer, burst apart, red and white scattering all over the ground. The scene was gruesome.

"You used the Red-Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer to strike your enemy. It feels as if you can control the force more subtly. The proficiency of the Red-Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer has increased."

After a glance at the information prompt floating in his vision, Xu Yunfan quickly dealt with Qin Bo's body. He fished some silver and a book from the other's pocket. After confirming there was nothing else of value, he dragged the corpse to the sewer outlet he had built and threw it into the Clear River.

There were many black fish roaming in the Clear River. A motionless corpse like Qin Bo's, once thrown in, would be gnawed down to a skeleton in a day or two.

The book he took from Qin Bo was a ritual of worship, its contents recorded in an extremely bloody manner. Most of it required human tissues for the sacrifice, but the steps were not complicated.

It revolved around a single word: sincerity. To be devout with one's whole body and mind, to relax, and to accept the Bodhisattva's inspection and baptism.

Xu Yunfan's gaze unconsciously fell on the Power-Awakened Bodhisattva he had thrown on the ground. He was now certain that this ritual was closely related to it.

He flipped through it casually and set the book aside for now; it might be useful later.

As for the contents of the glass bottle, Xu Yunfan also casually carried it and threw it into the Clear River. He really didn't want to see it again, afraid that looking at it too much would give him nightmares.

"Thousand Buddha Temple..."

Xu Yunfan gently touched the wooden Power-Awakened Bodhisattva. In his vision, prompts occasionally appeared about being affected by an ominous aura, but due to the existence of the Lin Character Mantra, it was counteracted and integrated, turning into an increase in his proficiency.

"You have been affected by an ominous aura."

"The vague figure visualized through the Lin Character Mantra has come into contact with the ominous aura. The proficiency of the Lin Character Mantra has increased."

Xu Yunfan temporarily put down the wooden statue, his mind on Fei Yao, the woman who had been with Qin Bo. However, there was no rush for that. Some things were too conspicuous to do during the day and risked exposing himself.

After breakfast, Xu Yunfan began to circulate his Qi and blood, then devoted himself wholeheartedly to the practice of the Swift Leg.

He planned to cultivate the Swift Leg to Great Completion first, and put the Red-Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer on hold for a day or two.

"You carefully controlled the muscles of your legs. Through the breathing and movement of the Swift Leg's force, your leg muscles have become increasingly suited to the Swift Leg's method of generating force. The proficiency of the Swift Leg has increased."

"You practiced the Swift Leg several times and found that your legs have become lighter and lighter, as if you could walk on walls. The proficiency of the Swift Leg has increased..."

He practiced until late afternoon. Utterly exhausted, Xu Yunfan plopped down on the threshold, panting heavily. He constantly flexed his muscles, trying to calm the blood and Qi that had been stirred to their peak.

In a single day, the proficiency of the Swift Leg had increased by over forty points.

[Swift Leg 977/1000 (Small Completion)]

[Special Effects: Treading danger as if on level ground, body as light as a swallow, leg force erupting, tireless movement, agile posture]

Xu Yunfan calculated to himself. If he focused on practicing tomorrow, the Swift Leg would step into the Great Completion realm.

By then, with both the Skin and Sinew stages at Great Completion, their combined effect would bring about a tremendous improvement to his physical quality, and his strength would naturally rise to a new level.

He looked up at the sky.

The sun was slanting west, and night was approaching.

That night, Xu Yunfan, dressed in black, silently stepped out the door, carrying the wooden mallet.
