# Chapter 217: A Single Sword Cleaves the Ship, Profound and Unfathomable!

The black ship, forged from dark iron, was solemn and imposing. Banners flew without wind, their black dragon motifs baring fangs and claws, displaying their might to the utmost.

The middle-aged man spoke clearly, "Friends aboard the Dragon Ship, please disembark. The remaining thousand miles of river shall be overseen by my Black Dragon Sect."

"You have traveled a long way and must be weary by now. If you are willing to make friends, you may join us for a drink. My Black Dragon Sect will arrange accommodation and treat you with utmost care."

Li Xian asked, "Madam, is the Black Dragon Sect very famous?"

Wen Caishang nodded. "The Black Dragon Sect has an immense background and countless strong experts."

Wen Caishang asked, "You are quite overbearing. May I ask for your name?"

"I am nothing special," the middle-aged man said. "One of the Four Guardians of the Black Dragon Sect, Guardian Black Brow."

Wen Caishang said, "The Four Guardians have all been dispatched. I recall that the Black Dragon Sect does not belong to the Yunan Dao or the Longxiong Dao sects."

"I didn't expect a woman like you to be so knowledgeable," Guardian Black Brow said. "Indeed, my Black Dragon Sect is not from Yunan or Longxiong. But slaying a flood dragon is a matter of great importance. My Black Dragon Sect heard the news and came. What of it? If you are sensible, you should leave quickly."

Wen Caishang said, "Truly worthy of a great sect, always acting domineering. You are determined to bully a woman, but there is nothing I can do about it."

"Senior Old Dragon is right here. If you have the ability, please come and take him."

Guardian Black Brow said, "Of course!" He held a heavy iron chain and threw it fiercely at the flood dragon. Wen Caishang's eyebrows raised slightly. A white snake shot out from her sleeve, instantly growing long and soft like a ribbon, entangling with the iron chain.

Guardian Black Brow said, "Good. You are determined to obstruct me, then I shall test your strength! Let me see how a mere woman can be so formidable!"

He channeled his internal Qi, sending it surging along the chain. Martial artists' techniques are varied and bizarre. However, in specific situations, they simplify things, deciding victory or defeat with pure internal Qi.

Wen Caishang said, "I am happy to oblige." A cold light flashed in her beautiful eyes. The iron chain and the soft sword sparked, and the surrounding river water rippled.

The killing power of martial arts is not necessarily dazzling. After a stalemate for a moment, Guardian Black Brow's expression suddenly changed; he felt his internal Qi was no match.

Wen Caishang flipped her sleeve and gripped the sword hilt. Her wrist rotated slightly. The White Snake Sword clung to the iron chain, rapidly extending and stabbing toward Guardian Black Brow's chest.

Guardian Black Brow was terrified, released the chain, and retreated several steps. The White Snake Sword stabbed empty air, but its锋利 edge still shone coldly.

Guardian Black Brow broke out in a cold sweat. Knowing he was outmatched, his expression turned ugly. "Good! Since you have such strength, let's see how far you can go! My Black Dragon Sect is not to be trifled with!"

He waved his hand.

The black ship moved aside, clearing a path. As the ship passed, Wen Caishang sheathed her long sword and sat quietly at the bow. "Get me that precious bow of mine and stand by my side."

Li Xian went to his cabin to retrieve the bow. Wen Caishang's bow was the "Zodiac Bow," with a yellow jade ornament hanging from it. Li Xian held the strange bow and observed it closely, immediately sensing its mystical nature.

The sunlight shone down.

The bow body emitted a faint mist, as if附着 with golden light. Wen Caishang said, "Try pulling the bowstring."

Li Xian pulled the bowstring, and suddenly, he felt all sounds cease. His senses were magnified; the speed, power, and meaning of the arrow were all completely different.

"Hmm?" Wen Caishang was slightly surprised. Seeing Li Xian pull the string, the bow resonated with him, actually displaying a strange phenomenon. A protective yellow aura enveloped his body.

She said, "Very good. You have a great affinity with this bow. Every time you shoot an arrow, the yellow jade ornament below the bow trembles slightly."

"When you shoot, the vibration caused by the arrow's body makes the yellow jade ornament shake four times, which triggers the bow's miraculous effect. The arrow will carry Zodiac Qi, capable of breaking armor and injuring the enemy with great power."

"It may even split into two, or three."

Li Xian immediately nocked an arrow and tested it by shooting toward the river. The yellow jade ornament trembled once.

Wen Caishang felt a hint of disappointment, thinking: "Since I obtained this bow, the number of times I have triggered the Zodiac Qi has been few. Although Li Xian's archery is good, to trigger the bow's miraculous effect... it might be..."

Suddenly, she saw Li Xian nock another arrow. This time, when he shot, the yellow jade ornament trembled three times in a row. Wen Caishang said, "Good, try once more."

Li Xian repeated the motion, memorizing the feeling of shooting. The moment he released the string, the arrow flew out. The yellow jade ornament trembled four times. The arrow seemed wrapped in yellow light, its speed suddenly increasing, shooting toward a black flag on a distant ship.

It turned out... the river surface was wide, and the view was vast. Li Xian had long since spotted the Black Dragon Sect's ship. When he shot, he aimed at the flag.

The arrow pierced into the iron flag post.

The remaining force penetrated through, and with a "bang," the black flag broke.

Everyone who saw this was shocked. The Flood Dragon said, "Excellent archery! Excellent archery!" Wen Caishang nodded repeatedly, full of praise.

Wen Caishang said, "Hold the bow and stand still, do not move recklessly. I will call you when I need you to shoot."

"Alright, I will follow the Madam's instructions," Li Xian said.

"When this journey is over, I must reward you well, reward you well," Wen Caishang said, gently stroking Li Xian's face, loving him immensely.

The Black Dragon Sect occupied the end of the Benhua River. For the last few hundred miles of the river, the Four Guardian Kings held their ground.

Forty-eight thousand six hundred miles.

The Black Dragon Sect's Purple Robed King and Red Eye King were steering a ship together. Seeing the flood dragon approaching, the Dragon Ship drew closer and closer.

Purple Robed King said, "It is truly surprising. According to my knowledge, this dragon is already old. I originally thought we could slaughter it at the forty-thousand-mile mark, but I didn't expect it to make it all the way here."

Red Eye King said, "It is a pity, a pity. If not for the Young Sect Master needing dragon blood to bathe, a dragon heart as an offering, and dragon tendons as a treasure. And by chance, we learned that a flood dragon was transforming into a dragon here, so we came to intercept and kill it. This old flood dragon has reached this point, only a hundred miles from the Guanjiang Estuary, it has practically succeeded in becoming a dragon."

"It is still a profitable venture," Purple Robed King said. "After all, we can share the 'Tears of the Mournful Dragon.' Although this item is not on my menu, having it in hand always gives us more bargaining chips."

Red Eye King said, "We cannot be careless. The flood dragon has reached this point, meaning it has already broken past Black Brow's guard. We must proceed with caution."

The ship drew near. At the bow of the ship, protecting the dragon to the sea, was actually a woman in a white dress.

Her beauty was peerless. The river wind fluttered, stirring her skirt. Her hair was like a waterfall, black and thick.

Wen Caishang wiped the White Snake Sword and asked calmly, "Which Kings of the Black Dragon Sect are you two?" Her eyes were fixed on the long sword, only using her peripheral vision to glance at the two of them.

Li Xian muttered to himself: "The Madam is ruthless in her actions, but she always flatters people a bit, never losing courtesy in her words. But sailing to this point, it seems she has finally unsheathed herself." He noticed the subtle difference.

"We are the..." Red Eye King and Purple Robed King stepped forward.

"Forget it," Wen Caishang said. "It is useless to listen." The White Snake Sword slashed out through the air, a streak of sword light shooting forth like a bolt of white silk.

The two Kings dodged to the left and right, about to施展 their techniques. Suddenly, they saw cracks spreading across the floorboards beneath their feet. The two exchanged a glance, their pupils trembling as they focused their attention.

They saw the cracks gradually spread, eventually covering the entire ship. Suddenly, with a "creak," the entire black ship broke in half from the middle, the cut smooth and flat, and it sank into the river. The two Kings jumped out of the ship, standing on the water, their shock and horror beyond words.

Li Xian was extremely startled. The ship was coated with iron on the outside and reinforced with strong wood on the inside. The ship's body was over a dozen zhang long. To cleave it in half with a single sword—how terrifyingly powerful!

Wen Caishang sat peacefully, her beautiful eyes glancing over. The two men felt a chill run through their entire bodies. Wen Caishang said softly, "Go on."

Li Xian couldn't help but think: "No wonder I hide my strength; the Madam hides hers too. With so many powerful martial arts, she won't teach me a single bit. Fine... A man must rely on himself. I will practice the martial arts I have now and search for profound techniques step by step."

The Dragon Ship sailed on. The two Kings dared not obstruct it.

At the same time.

At the river mouth where the river meets the sea, a grand banquet was set up on the coast. This was the final banquet for the Dragon Slaying Feast, personally presided over by the Black Dragon Sect's Young Sect Master.

The Black Dragon Sect had Yin and Yang Envoys, Four Kings, Five Lake Wanderers, Four Seas Eccentrics, and Nine Great Experts. For this Dragon Slaying Feast, the Black Dragon Sect's Young Sect Master, "Sheng Yunfei," brought three Kings, a Four Seas Eccentric, and four Great Experts to attend.

Among the Four Seas Eccentrics, there was a "Sea-Gazing Eccentric." He had shed his mortal shell and revealed strange eyes. From a high mountain, he was observing the situation.

Seeing a single sword cleave a ship, his face turned pale with shock. He immediately used his lightness skill and ran back to the banquet at the river's end. "Young... Young Sect Master, it is not good! It is not good!"

Sheng Yunfei had a youthful appearance, with soaring eyebrows and sharp, eagle-like eyes. He remained calm and said, "Why are you so panicked? Where has it reached?"

"It has reached the Red Eye King and Purple Robed King," the Sea-Gazing Eccentric said.

"Couldn't they stop it?" Sheng Yunfei raised an eyebrow. "To reach this place, it must have some ability. It is within expectations that they couldn't stop it."

"It... it's not just that they couldn't stop it," the Sea-Gazing Eccentric shook his head. "That woman protecting the dragon... she split the ship in two with a sword!"

"What!" Sheng Yunfei was startled inwardly but pretended to be calm. He asked, "Are you telling the truth? If she is a master swordsman, it is not impossible. How many swords did she use?"

"One sword!" the Sea-Gazing Eccentric said.

Suddenly, with a "clatter," the cup in Sheng Yunfei's hand fell. Fine wine spilled all over the ground.

Sheng Yunfei thought: "Martial artists have different strengths. Some martial arts are powerful against enemies but have little destructive power. For example, the 'Floating Dust Palm' of the Qingyuan Sect cannot even cut a stone, but against people, it is extremely formidable. Some martial arts have immense destructive power but are terrible at killing enemies. For example, the 'Heavenly Blade Gate's' Earth Annihilating Slash can cut a ship in half... perhaps this woman is like that."

He forced himself to remain calm and kicked the cup with his toe. The cup flew back into his hand, and the wine on the ground actually flowed back from the ground, gathering back into the cup. He said, "Good. Go and scout again. If there is any situation, report back immediately!"

The Sea-Gazing Eccentric used his lightness skill, rushing up the mountain to observe from a high point.

Half an hour later.

He saw the Dragon Ship and the battered old flood dragon travel another hundred miles... they had already reached the location of the four Great Experts.

The four Great Experts were stationed on both banks, surrounding them simultaneously. They arranged their formation.

The Sea-Gazing Eccentric thought: "With the four Great Experts摆下 formation, they should be able to stop this woman!"

But in less than a moment, he was dumbfounded, witnessing a terrifying scene. He immediately flew down the mountain. "Not good, not good... Young Sect Master, it is not good!"

Sheng Yunfei strode over. "What happened?"

"The... the four Great Experts have been defeated!" the Sea-Gazing Eccentric said. "This time, it wasn't one sword."

Sheng Yunfei felt slightly relieved, thinking that although the four Great Experts were defeated, if they could entangle her for a while, it would be good news.

The Sea-Gazing Eccentric said, "It was one person, one sword!"

"What do you mean? Didn't I tell them to摆下 a formation?" Sheng Yunfei frowned deeply, his joy vanishing instantly, his heart suspended in the air. "Why were they defeated so quickly?"

"They did摆下 a formation," the Sea-Gazing Eccentric said. "But that woman saw through the formation at a glance."

"Good... what a formidable woman. The four Great Experts' formation involves the changes of constellations and the rotation of the four seasons. How could it be so easily broken!" Sheng Yunfei said. "Go scout again!"

Half an hour later, the Sea-Gazing Eccentric ran back again. "Young Sect Master, it is not good, they couldn't hold the line again!" He swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

Sheng Yunfei slapped the armrest and stood up in anger. "Another one?"

The Sea-Gazing Eccentric nodded numbly.

Just then, a light voice was heard from afar: "Young Sect Master of the Black Dragon Sect, Caishang greets you here."

On the river, a ship was slowly approaching.

At the bow stood a woman in white, purer than snow, holding a long sword in her arms. Her clothes fluttered, and her gaze was cold and deep.
