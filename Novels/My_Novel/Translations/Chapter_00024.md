# Chapter 24: The Snowy Path’s Odd Happenings and the Relationship of Sustenance

Beyond the manor lay the ascending mountain path.

Snow blanketed the road, with the right side dropping off into a sheer cliff. Every step had to be taken with extreme caution; a single misstep or slip could send one tumbling down the precipice.

Li Xian brushed the snow from his shoulders and shook his hair, gazing into the distance. The mountains were draped in silver, a breathtaking sight.

Further out, stretches of farmland spread endlessly.

The accompanying guards told him that almost everything within sight belonged to the Manor Mistress.

Every blade of grass and tree was surnamed… “Wen.”

“Manor Mistress” referred to the master of the manor. The Mistress did not bear the surname “Zhuang,” but rather “Wen.”

“What is this Mistress’s background? She’s far too wealthy,” Li Xian couldn’t help but remark.

Having lived two lives, past and present, he had seen quite a bit of the world.

This world, whether in population size or other aspects, was far more vast.

A Grade D guard, shivering, his martial arts foundation shallow, his Dantian Qi scarce, and his resistance to the cold slightly lacking, was frozen to the point of frustration and irritability. He cursed under his breath, “These lowly peasants are truly something. Couldn’t they just bring the rent to the manor themselves? Making us go to their doorsteps.”

The guard Qiao Dashou immediately chimed in, “Exactly, exactly. The key is, we take the trouble to visit them. If they don’t serve us good food and fine dishes, that’s one thing, but to cry and make a scene? Who are they putting on a show for?”

“Hahaha, when I meet types like that, I give them a couple of slaps. They’re born with lowly bones; they won’t be honest without a beating,” another guard laughed.

The guards chattered on. Not being familiar with them, Li Xian didn’t want to join in and just kept his head down, hurrying along.

“Everyone’s in luck.”

After walking another three or four miles, the snow showed signs of letting up. Feng Huo, whose brow had been tightly furrowed, finally relaxed a bit and found the mood to chat and joke with his brothers.

“Brother Feng, you’re an old hand at this. We’ve heard you’ve encountered quite a few strange things?”

“Yeah, it’s boring walking. Tell us a story to liven things up.”

Someone started the ruckus, clamoring to hear some mountain lore.

Feng Huo shuddered, recalling some unpleasant memories, and roared, “Hear what? Hurry up and walk, get there and back quickly! Do you think this is a pleasure trip?”

The shout instantly silenced the group. Feng Huo figured he’d need their help later and didn’t want things to get too awkward, so he offered a brief explanation, “It’s not that I don’t want to tell you, but the stories are too creepy. If you really want to hear, we can talk about it after we get back to the manor.”

They came to a fork in the road where a signpost stood. The path on the right led to Longevity Village, while the left led to “Tiger and Bear Mountain.”

“This Tiger and Bear Mountain also belongs to the Mistress,” Zhao Dachun said, looking towards the left.

The mountain range stretched out in undulating waves, with faint roars of beasts echoing.

“The Mistress loves to go on winter hunts in the mountains every year.”

“估计再过不久，又开始冬狩了。” (It’s estimated that before long, the winter hunt will start again.)

“We Grade D guards are just here to make up the numbers.”

“Winter hunt?” Li Xian’s heart stirred. “What is the winter hunt?”

The guards all turned to look at him at once. Throughout the journey, everyone had been chatting and joking, but he was the only one keeping his head down, hurrying along. For this guy to suddenly ask a question, no one felt like paying him any mind.

Zhao Dachun coughed twice and reluctantly explained, “The winter hunt is a regular event at our manor. Guards can participate, but…”

He was cut off by Qiao Dashou. “Let’s go, let’s go, pick up the pace. What’s the point of talking about useless things?”

Zhao Dachun gave an awkward smile and changed the subject.

Outside Longevity Village.

Li Xian and the others finally arrived.

“I told you to practice your martial arts diligently, but you were lazy and looked for shortcuts. Now look, you can’t even keep up with a newcomer.”

A Grade D guard named Ye Xiaoluo had caught a chill on the road and was breaking out in a cold sweat. By the time they reached Longevity Village, his complexion looked off.

Feng Huo had to channel some Qi into him to warm him up. But after this trip, he was guaranteed to be sick in bed for three days.

Ye Xiaoluo, weak and with trembling legs, glanced at Li Xian and cursed him under his breath as a “freak.”

Walking dozens of miles on a mountain path, and he wasn’t even out of breath.

They had to know that flat ground was one thing, a mountain path was another, and a snowy mountain path was yet another. It looked close, but it was exhausting to walk.

“It was fine at first, but a gust of wind blew, and I started feeling worse and more uncomfortable.”

“Alright, stop making excuses.”

Feng Huo waved his hand, not wanting to hear it.

He said to the group, “For collecting rent, go in pairs.”

“You, the newcomer, you go with Zhao Dachun. If there’s anything you don’t understand, ask him.”

The guards scattered, rubbing their fists and palms, as if ready to get down to business.

“Is this whole village the Mistress’s tenant farmers?” Li Xian asked as he walked with Zhao Dachun.

“Hehe.” Zhao Dachun pointed into the distance. “Not just this one. The neighboring Longevity Village, Fuliang Village, Wangjia Village… every single one of them relies on the Mistress for a living.”

“With tens of thousands of acres of good farmland, someone has to tend to it, right?”

Li Xian was secretly astounded. Zhao Dachun counted on his fingers and added, “Conservatively speaking, a dozen or so villages are all the Mistress’s tenant farmers.”

“What kind of rent do we collect?” Li Xian asked.

“Winter rent.”

As they spoke, they arrived at a house. Zhao Dachun straightened his clothes and tidied his hair. “At our manor, we collect rent three times a year.”

“The Mistress’s fields are all prime farmland, yielding two harvests a year, with two dan of grain per mu. We collect rent after each harvest.”

“We usually take half the yield. In winter, when it’s farming downtime. Although these farmers aren’t tending the fields anymore, they need firewood. The Mistress owns many mountains within dozens of miles.”

“However, it wouldn’t be good if these tenant farmers starved to death. So the winter rent is usually half of what it is normally. The Mistress is kind-hearted; this is quite generous.”

“The Lin family in the neighboring Qingning County are also big landlords. Although they can’t compare to our Mistress, they have plenty of tenant farmers under them. Now *they* are the ones who devour people without spitting out the bones.”

Zhao Dachun went on and on. Li Xian thought to himself, “Your Mistress isn’t much better.”

Li Xian said, “What do you think the Mistress needs so much money for?”

Zhao Dachun shook his head. “That’s beyond my imagination. But… I’ve heard a thing or two. A celestial beauty like the Mistress, she earns a lot, but she spends a lot too.”

“Besides the tens of thousands of acres of farmland, she has other industries, shops, and land in the surrounding counties and cities.”

“Exactly…” Li Xian suddenly had an epiphany. “If martial artists didn’t have great estates and great wealth, how could they sustain ‘Rebirth and Transformation’ to wash away this ‘clay body’!”

A martial artist who has undergone Rebirth and Transformation, transcending the mundane, requires “sustenance”!

Whether it was the thousand-plus servants or these villages, or even us guards, we are all links in the chain that sustains the “Mistress.”

Of course, conversely, the existence of the “Mistress” also brought stability to the manor and its surroundings.

Zhao Dachun suddenly whispered in Li Xian’s ear, “Don’t say anything later, just watch.”

They had arrived at a thatched cottage.

He knocked on the door and shouted, “Open up! Guards from the One Union Manor, here to collect rent!”

“Open up, or I’ll kick the door down!”

Zhao Dachun was no different from the other guards. When threatening and shouting at the farmers, his eyes glinted with a fierce light, truly intimidating.

“Master… here I come.”

“Cough… cough…”

A hoarse voice came from inside. The door was pushed open to reveal an old man. His hair was white as snow, his back bent, and he seemed to be suffering from a cold.

“I say, Old Zhu, are you too old and useless? Why did it take you so long to open the door?” Zhao Dachun pushed the door wide open, letting the cold wind rush in, and strode into the house with a grin.
