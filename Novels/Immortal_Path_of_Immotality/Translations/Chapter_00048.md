# Chapter 48: The Prodigal Immortal Nan

The Silver River Market was a gathering place for cultivators, though it functioned more like a loose alliance of rogue practitioners. High-level cultivators had established organizations within to maintain order and structure.

Simply put, idlers weren't tolerated.

With countless mortals in the world and numerous rogue cultivators, but only a single spiritual vein in the market, the available spiritual energy had to be rationed. Thus, population control was necessary.

To reside and cultivate in the market, rent was mandatory. Some areas with dense spiritual energy could cost dozens of spirit stones per month.

Guangnan the Wanderer, being poor with only sixty to seventy spirit stones to his name, could only afford a tiny dwelling on the outermost layer for two spirit stones per month.

But Guangnan didn't just cultivate after renting his space. He learned that most cultivators there had occupations to earn spirit stones and maintain their stay.

He began seeking employment, first at a artifact-forging workshop as a blacksmith's apprentice.

However, the materials required for immortal artifacts were at least low-grade spiritual items. 

Ordinary iron required a hundred refinements to become steel, ten thousand to become fine steel, and a hundred thousand to become a first-grade spiritual material—refined iron.

Though Guangnan was at the mid Qi Refining stage, his seventy years of age made it difficult to keep up with the physically demanding work. His output fell far behind other apprentices, and he was eventually dismissed.

Undeterred, he tried his luck at an alchemy workshop as a furnace tender. But lacking knowledge of medicinal principles, he repeatedly ruined batches of ingredients and was promptly expelled.

He then attempted various other occupations—auction house promoter, spirit beast caretaker, formation pavilion purchaser, puppet workshop craftsman, talisman building quality inspector—only to be dismissed from each in turn.

Finally, he realized that without specialized skills, he couldn't establish himself in the cultivation market.

Just then, the spiritual fields on the market's outskirts were hiring farmhands. Guangnan saw his opportunity.

Farming? That's my expertise!

Excited, he applied, only to discover that spiritual field pests were far more troublesome than mundane ones. The work also required mastery of rain-summoning, fertilizing, temperature control spells—nothing like ordinary farming.

Determined, Guangnan spent twenty spirit stones on "The Complete Guide to Spiritual Farming," which contained agricultural techniques and basic spells like rain summoning and fertilization.

Through diligent study and his innate farming talent, he gradually improved the fields. His mastery of cloud and rain manipulation spells brought visible progress, with spiritual grains growing plump day by day.

But good times didn't last. Just as Guangnan's fortunes improved, cultivators clashed near the market. One combatant was a disciple of the Beast Taming Valley, one of the three great sects.

The Valley specialized in controlling venomous insects, and some escaped during the battle, eventually wreaking havoc on the spiritual fields as a full-blown infestation.

By the time Foundation Establishment experts intervened to eliminate the pests, the fields were already ruined.

The farm owner, an experienced businessman, dared not seek justice against a major sect disciple and reluctantly swallowed the loss. Deciding spiritual farming was too risky, he abandoned the business altogether.

Guangnan was devastated—just as he'd mastered a skill, his employer went under. At his wit's end, after two years in Silver River Market with all his spirit stones exhausted and unable to pay rent, the seventy-year-old had no choice but to leave the cultivation market he'd grown attached to.

Returning to the mortal world, Guangnan sought out old friends in落魄, lamenting how he should have heeded their advice. 

Comforting him, they again suggested becoming a retainer for a mortal prince—a leisurely, comfortable life.

Approaching his former patron, the open-minded prince welcomed him back despite past events.

Guangnan abandoned cultivation entirely, indulging in pleasures until his death in his nineties.

Before passing, he returned home, leaving behind his legacy in a jade slip for future generations—hoping to spare them his hardships.

Lin Shan opened his eyes with mixed feelings. Guangnan's life reminded him of many ordinary people's journeys—starting disadvantaged, struggling in the city without skills, then retreating to a rural hometown to live out their days.

"Is this the reality for average cultivators? No wonder Senior Nan and his sister chose to be retainers at Chu Palace—they must have read Guangnan's biography."

Comparing himself to Guangnan upon first entering Silver River Market, Lin Shan realized he was worse off in every aspect except his enhancement panel.

Guangnan had been at Qi Refining layer six with sixty to seventy spirit stones and farming skills. Lin Shan was only at layer three with eight stones and no skills.

"Could becoming a retainer be the right path for rogue cultivators? Are the immortal masters serving the Nightingale headquarters in the capital just poor rogue cultivators too?"

Lin Shan felt he'd guessed correctly.

But then he remembered—after returning from Silver River, Guangnan served as a retainer for over twenty years! Calculating, he must have accumulated over a hundred spirit stones by his death, plus his farming manual!

Lin Shan hurriedly checked his storage pouch—only eight spirit stones remained, nothing else.

In his mind's eye, Immortal Nan seemed to mock him silently.

"Damn it! That prodigal bastard!" Lin Shan howled in anguish. A hundred spirit stones and a skill manual—gone!

He could easily imagine Immortal Nan, three centuries later, inheriting the legacy, reaching mid Qi Refining, somehow finding "Silver River," splurging on cultivation materials for his sister, then selling the farming manual to buy defensive and healing talismans before giving up entirely.

The thought pained him—Guangnan's lifelong savings squandered by that wastrel!

Had it been him, he'd have either bought cultivation pills or a skill manual to establish an income source. But Immortal Nan chose to spend it all and return to mortal service—the ultimate slacker attitude.

"Trash! Absolutely hopeless!" Lin Shan fumed, conveniently forgetting his own past thoughts of just getting by before retiring to a small hometown.

---

After calming down, Lin Shan acknowledged some logic in Immortal Nan's choice—without extraordinary opportunities, advancement was indeed difficult for rogue cultivators.

But with his enhancement panel, eighteen years of age, and boundless possibilities ahead, Lin Shan refused mediocrity. The thought of the Nascent Soul stage's near-millennium lifespan filled him with longing.

Moreover, he remembered that night in the wilderness temple when his enhancement panel had revealed the existence of supreme beings like the Buddha of the Immortal Realm, who had even gazed across realms at him.

"This world is vast, and my future limitless!" Clenching his fists, Lin Shan's eyes burned with ambition.

Then he recalled one more thing that might bring unexpected gains before heading to the capital—the "Primordial Vermilion Fruit" in his possession.
