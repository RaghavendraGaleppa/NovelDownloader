# Chapter 33: One Year  

Han Yue conversed with Xiao Luo along the way, exchanging information about the great sects' legacies.  

He gained considerable insights!  

His understanding of these top-tier cultivation forces deepened significantly.  

The most fundamental requirement for a top-tier force was having at least two fourth-rank Longevity True Lords within the sect!  

Only then could it be proven that the sect possessed a direct path to the Great Dao of Longevity.  

With multiple Longevity True Lords safeguarding the sect, its legacy could endure perpetually!  

The Beast Taming Sect had been passed down for over fifty thousand years. Since its founding ancestor, the Dragon Taming True Lord, six Longevity True Lords had emerged, five of whom were beast tamers, each accompanied by a fourth-rank life-bound spirit beast that followed them in cultivation.  

Thus, the Beast Taming Sect boasted a total of eleven fourth-rank combatants, ranking it in the upper-middle tier among all top-tier forces in the [Jade Sky Realm]!  

In contrast, the Green Lotus Sword Sect, located in the same region, had only produced four Longevity Sword Cultivators—less than half of the Beast Taming Sect's number.  

Though both were fourth-rank major forces, the Green Lotus Sword Sect's strength and influence were relatively weaker.  

Above the fourth-rank forces, there existed fifth-rank forces!  

To become a fifth-rank force, a sect must have once produced a fifth-rank Great Cultivator!  

Only six fifth-rank major forces in the entire [Jade Sky Realm] had achieved this feat.  

Interestingly, because fifth-rank cultivators no longer existed in the world, the highest cultivation realm in the [Jade Sky Realm] was the fourth rank!  

This meant that, to some extent, there was no fundamental gap in power between fourth and fifth-rank forces within the realm.  

This was also why both fourth and fifth-rank sects were referred to as top-tier forces.  

Xiao Luo had already promised to recommend Han Yue for admission into the Beast Taming Sect.  

Although Han Yue still hoped to find a major sect more suited to his path of spell cultivation, this didn't hinder his efforts to build a good relationship with Xiao Luo.  

If all else failed, the Beast Taming Sect was an acceptable option!  

As they chatted, the two roamed the outer domains, slaughtering freely.  

In a single day, they traversed thousands of kilometers, killing seven second-rank demonic beasts and filling all their storage spaces to the brim.  

With Xiao Luo, a powerful body cultivator, leading the charge, Han Yue suddenly found second-rank demonic beasts no longer a threat!  

None of the beasts they encountered could withstand Xiao Luo's iron fists.  

The stronger ones might manage to unleash a few divine abilities and exchange a few blows with Xiao Luo, while the weaker ones were instantly dazed by a single punch, leaving Han Yue to finish them off with a few swift strikes.  

Their coordination grew increasingly seamless!  

After slaying the seventh beast, the two parted ways, with Han Yue heading straight back to Butcher's Market.  

---  

Xiao Luo, however, continued hunting demonic beasts in the outer domains, taking advantage of Han Yue's rest period to earn more spirit stones.  

Han Yue returned to the trading house and immediately sought out Xiao Qing to conduct business!  

Even for a trading house of this scale, purchasing fourteen second-rank demonic beasts at once took some time!  

After the transaction was completed, the tally showed that Han Yue had earned a staggering 68,700 trade coins—convertible to 687 mid-grade spirit stones!  

Of this, 232 were owed to Xiao Luo.  

Han Yue pocketed a net gain of 455 mid-grade spirit stones!  

This was the most lucrative transaction he had made since arriving at Butcher's Market!  

These 400-plus spirit stones were more than enough to buy everything he owned, with plenty to spare!  

Han Yue exchanged the trade coins for Xiao Luo's 232 mid-grade spirit stones, then returned home to rest, waiting only to replenish his mana before setting out again!  

Three days later, a golden streak split the sky!  

Han Yue once again ventured into the outer domains!  

He flew straight to the pond, where a towering pile of four second-rank demonic beast corpses awaited—Xiao Luo's spoils from three days of relentless hunting!  

Without a word, Han Yue stuffed them into his corpse-storing pouch and joined Xiao Luo for another expedition!  

To the two of them, the demonic beasts of the outer domains had become an inexhaustible mine of spirit stones!  

Another day passed, and Han Yue returned with another haul!  

And so it went—  

A cycle of repetition, over and over!  

Slaughtering pigs, butchering cattle, killing dogs, and cooking sheep!  

Countless demons and monsters fell to the duo's hands!  

The sharp iron hooks on the trading house's first floor were now laden with the spines of second-rank demonic beasts!  

A year passed in the blink of an eye!  

The two were now in vastly different states!  

Han Yue stood atop a mountain peak, fiddling with a massive grill. He ignited several first-rank fire talismans to roast an enormous ox leg.  

Beside him lay the carcass of a massive second-rank ox, already mostly dismembered.  

A two-meter-tall black panther stared fixedly at the ox leg, drooling—clearly unable to wait any longer to eat.  

Han Yue chuckled and said,  

"Don't rush, Milk Green. We've got plenty of time. If you want this ox, I'll roast all of it for you."  

"Xiao Luo said her refinement will take at least seven days. We'll definitely finish this ox by then!"  

After a year of working together, Han Yue and Milk Green's relationship had transformed—they were now as close as sworn brothers!  

At the foot of the mountain, Xiao Luo's refinement had reached a critical juncture.  

After a year of nurturing, the [Crimson-Horned Python] had finally succeeded in refining third-rank mana two days prior, advancing to the second-rank Great Perfection stage!  

---  

Xiao Luo had fed the [Crimson-Horned Python] over a hundred second-rank demonic beasts and countless spirit herbs, expending an astronomical amount of resources!  

Now, Xiao Luo sat cross-legged by the pond's edge, hand seals formed as she silently channeled her mana.  

The [Crimson-Horned Python] had half its body stretched out of the water, its massive head motionless before Xiao Luo.  

After a year of taming, the python had been completely subdued, not daring to resist in the slightest.  

At this moment, Xiao Luo was practicing the Beast Taming Sect's secret technique, integrating the [Crimson-Horned Python] into her cultivation system.  

From time to time, she flicked a mana rune toward the python's head.  

The rune drilled into the python's body through the horn on its head, where it was refined and absorbed!  

Each time this happened, the python's body would tremble violently—clearly enduring significant pain!  

As the runes continued to be refined, the connection between Xiao Luo and the [Crimson-Horned Python] grew increasingly fluid!  

After a year together, Han Yue had come to understand Xiao Luo much better.  

Xiao Luo was one of the Beast Taming Sect's twenty-four core disciples of this generation, holding a high status within the sect!  

She cultivated the sect's foundational scripture, the [Great Dragon Taming Demon Subduing True Scripture], which could lead all the way to the fourth-rank Longevity realm—a first-class supreme technique in the [Jade Sky Realm]!  

Currently at the second-rank Great Perfection stage, she was preparing to advance to the third rank!  

The [Crimson-Horned Python] was one of the most suitable demonic beasts for refinement as recorded in the [Great Dragon Taming Demon Subduing True Scripture], offering immense benefits to her cultivation.  

The technique Xiao Luo was practicing now was the scripture's demon-refining secret art, the [Soul Binding Covenant]. Once mastered, it would allow her to control the demon's soul as effortlessly as wielding her own limbs!
