# Chapter 45: Black Jade Spirit Snake Nest, Battle Allocation

Since hearing about it from Second Uncle two years ago, Qi Chuan had kept the matter in mind without showing any outward interest. Now, as Mu Rong Fan mentioned that the treasure map's location was also in the Black Snake Abyss, he felt a stirring of excitement.

"If we can kill a mid-tier first-grade Black Jade Spirit Snake in the Black Snake Abyss and obtain its gallbladder, we could refine Black Jade Restoration Pills. That might solve the minor meridians issue Second Uncle has been suffering from," Qi Chuan thought. 

"Would fixing his meridians allow Second Uncle to advance from the third level of Qi Refinement to the mid-stage?" 

He quickly dismissed the idea. While Second Uncle's meridians had indeed been damaged in his youth, his low-grade ninth-rank spiritual root and age remained limiting factors. At best, fixing the meridians might offer slight relief from the occasional pain, but a breakthrough to the mid-stage was unlikely.

"Still, this would serve two purposes—helping Second Uncle and exploring the treasure site," Qi Chuan mused, already making up his mind.

"...Brother Qi, what do you think? Will you join the expedition?" Mu Rong Fan asked after explaining more about the treasure map, his gaze expectant.

If Qi Chuan refused, Mu Rong Fan would have to seek another partner—preferably another fourth-level Qi Refinement inner disciple. Higher-level cultivators were untrustworthy, while those at the third level might prove unreliable. Given the existing cooperation between their families, Qi Chuan was the safer choice.

"Will there be others joining us?" Qi Chuan inquired.

"Just the two of us. More people mean more complications and greater risks," Mu Rong Fan replied.

Qi Chuan nodded in agreement. "Then I accept. May our cooperation be as smooth as before." He extended his hand.

Mu Rong Fan smiled and shook it. "Agreed. The same profit split as before?"

Qi Chuan confirmed. Their usual arrangement was an equal fifty-fifty split unless circumstances dictated otherwise.

Mu Rong Fan then produced a yellowed, rust-stained parchment—a map with cryptic markings. Though initially indecipherable, Qi Chuan gradually understood the treasure's location as Mu Rong Fan explained. 

He wasn't worried about Qi Chuan betraying him—doing so would invite severe retaliation, given their equal status as inner disciples from prominent families.

"Let's prepare separately and depart in three days," Mu Rong Fan suggested after finishing his explanation.

"Agreed," Qi Chuan said before returning to his upper-tier first-grade cave dwelling.

There, he spent the next few days consolidating his cultivation. 

**[You cultivated the Evergreen Art, absorbing spiritual energy and refining medicinal potency into your own mana. Triggering a sevenfold critical hit, you gained seven times the rewards. Your mana reserves increased slightly.]**

The residual effects of the Gathering Essence Pill were fully absorbed, stabilizing his fifth-level Qi Refinement foundation.

Three days later, Qi Chuan emerged from his cave to find Mu Rong Fan waiting. 

"Brother Qi, ready to go?" Mu Rong Fan asked.

"Let's move," Qi Chuan replied.

The two then cast Levitation Spells and flew toward the sect's main gate.

Sixty li northwest of the Windmoon Sect lay Black Snake City. 

The two youths paid the entry fee and entered the bustling streets, blending in as ordinary travelers. The city teemed with mortals and a scattering of low-level cultivators—mostly first or second-level Qi Refinement practitioners. 

"This city thrives because of its proximity to the Black Snake Abyss," Mu Rong Fan explained. "Many rogue cultivators come here to hunt Black Jade Spirit Snakes, though they rarely venture beyond the outer regions. The sect maintains a presence here to keep order."

Qi Chuan nodded. The Windmoon Sect governed numerous settlements, and cities like this—where mortals and cultivators coexisted—required oversight.

After a brief rest, they left through the opposite gate and beheld a massive black scar upon the land—the Black Snake Abyss. 

The fissure stretched endlessly, its depths shrouded in darkness, punctuated by eerie beastly cries. Undaunted, the two entered.

The abyss's outer regions were dimly lit, with towering stone walls blocking sunlight. Few snakes or rogue cultivators lurked here, the latter keeping their distance warily.

As they ventured deeper, encounters with rogue cultivators dwindled, while lower-tier Black Jade Spirit Snakes became more frequent. These were easily dispatched, their blood deterring further attacks from their kin.

Eventually, they reached the abyss's heart—home to mid-tier first-grade Black Jade Spirit Snakes. Proceeding cautiously, they paused at a fork in the path.

Mu Rong Fan gestured ahead. At the end of the leftmost path lay a cave amidst black rubble. Before it, a depression in the stone housed two massive black serpents—each over ten feet long—coiled together, their scales glinting coldly as they hissed.

A Black Jade Spirit Snake nest—with two mid-tier first-grade specimens, likely a breeding pair.

"The female is usually stronger. I'll take her. You handle the male. Agreed?" Mu Rong Fan proposed.

Qi Chuan arched a brow but nodded. "Deal."
