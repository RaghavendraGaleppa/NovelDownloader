**Chapter 34: Dragons Do Not Dwell with Snakes**  

The grand hall.  

The atmosphere grew heavy in an instant.  

Lin Daoqi stood solemnly, silent, exuding an oppressive aura without even uttering a word. He merely lifted his gaze slightly, his eyes settling on Wang Dingli.  

Wang Dingli, tall and slender with a snow-white neck resembling a swan's, had an especially prominent Adam's apple that marked his gender. Without hesitation, he declared, "The eight of us have had little prior interaction. Now that we share common ideals and seek to achieve great things together, it would be unfair to determine superiority based on past achievements alone.  

"As martial artists and members of the jianghu, let us settle this with martial prowess.  

"I nominate Brother Lin.  

"Who else do you nominate?  

"Anyone who wishes to step forward may do so. The victor shall lead, and the defeated must accept their loss without resentment—blame only your own inadequacy."  

Wang Dingli's gaze fixed on Chen Weiquan as he asked solemnly, "What do you think?"  

Chen Weiquan replied calmly, "Since we are of the jianghu, victory and defeat shall be decided by martial skill. I support this."  

Lin Daoqi gripped his scabbard tightly and declared, "Then it's settled. Who will go first?"  

Though his words invited challengers, his eyes were locked onto Dou Changsheng, making his intentions clear—he had already marked Dou Changsheng as his opponent.  

This so-called "Righteous Alliance" was nothing more than a hastily assembled farce. With just eight members, it was little more than a gathering of ambitious individuals. Yet, here they were, already vying for dominance—truly a laughable spectacle.  

Chen Weiquan had been stoking the flames with ulterior motives, while Lin Daoqi and Wang Dingli had long conspired to use the Qingyang Spring Conference as a stage to elevate their own reputations.  

Forming the Righteous Alliance and broadcasting it far and wide—they had no real expectations for its success. Their sole aim was to inflate their status and gain fame.  

Lin Daoqi, born into a prominent family, might have appeared rough and unrefined, but he was a master at crafting his reputation.  

Dou Changsheng's brow twitched slightly as he surveyed the others. It was clear that the remaining members were deeply invested in the Righteous Alliance.  

This was hardly surprising. Among the eight present, aside from himself—a mere pretender—the others all hailed from illustrious backgrounds.  

Lin Daoqi was a descendant of the Lin Clan of the capital, inheritors of the peerless martial art *Thirteen Blades of Wind and Cloud*. Their ancestor had once earned the title "Sage of Blades"—a distinction of immense prestige.  

Chen Weiquan's father held a high-ranking position as a minister of the Northern Jin Dynasty.  

Wang Dingli hailed from the Yunding Sect, a top-tier sect in the capital region.  

The remaining members, too, came from distinguished lineages.  

With such pedigrees, it was no wonder the Qingyang Daoist had been so frustrated. Individually, these backgrounds might have been manageable, but collectively, they were a force even he dared not offend.  

The eight of them, united in purpose, formed connections that could be leveraged by their respective factions to craft a legendary tale—much like the "Ten Heroes of the Capital," the "Eight Wolves of the Grasslands," or the "Seven Knights of the North."  

With strength and lineage combined, their reputations were already soaring.  

Chen Weiquan, Wang Dingli, and the others all turned their gazes toward Dou Changsheng, their intent clear—they wanted him to face Lin Daoqi in battle.  

Noticing this, Dou Changsheng glanced at the silent Purple Sun and Red Sun Daoists, who had remained passive throughout.  

The hall was not just occupied by the eight of them—many disciples of the Three Suns Sect stood by, unable to intervene.  

Dou Changsheng raised his wine cup, drained it in one gulp, and slowly rose to his feet. He strode out of the hall to where Lin Daoqi stood, his scabbard discarded, a broad-bladed saber in hand.  

The weapon was pitch-black, its surface shimmering like flowing ink—clearly no ordinary blade, but a rare treasure.  

As the most outstanding disciple of the Lin Clan, Lin Daoqi was entrusted with such a weapon.  

Dou Changsheng's lips parted slightly as he uttered three words:  

"Make your move."  

Lin Daoqi sneered, his thick black beard bristling as he raised his saber high and slashed downward.  

A dark light surged from the blade, swirling around it like a black whirlwind. The strike was swift as lightning, its chilling edge already upon Dou Changsheng.  

But Lin Daoqi did not stop there. With a stomp, the stone beneath his feet shattered as he leapt into the air, descending with another devastating slash.  

The howling wind carried a thunderous roar as the sheer force of the blow compressed and shattered the air, creating a near-vacuum in its wake.  

Lin Daoqi was cautious—Dou Changsheng's past feats left no room for carelessness.  

Dou Changsheng watched calmly. After training under a Divine Master and spending considerable time traveling to Three Suns Mountain, he had undergone a transformation.  

*Limitless Sword Art, Ninth Form: Two Hundred and Fifty-Eight Swords!*  

The final three techniques of this Heaven-tier martial art were its killing strokes.  

Now, Dou Changsheng had mastered them all.  

Without moving, countless strands of sword qi erupted from his body, manifesting as pristine three-foot-long swords that hovered before him.  

Each sword gleamed with a pure white light, their edges radiating an indomitable sharpness.  

Under the Divine Master's tutelage, Dou Changsheng had learned that the *Limitless Sword Art* was not merely about quantity—quality mattered just as much.  

The Hero's Sword, a treasure in its own right, possessed an innate sharpness. By meditating on its essence day and night, Dou Changsheng had imbued his *Limitless Sword Art* with a similar attribute.  

Though it could not match the Hero's Sword, the art was now far beyond its former self.  

With a roar, the white swords shot toward Lin Daoqi.  

The clash between the devastating saber light and the swords was cataclysmic—blade and sword alike shattered in the exchange.  

Yet, while the saber light was swiftly overwhelmed, the swords showed no sign of diminishing. Instead, they multiplied, forming intricate formations that amplified their power.  

*Boom!*  

A deafening explosion echoed as Lin Daoqi's saber cleaved through countless swords, its momentum unstoppable.  

Dou Changsheng remained unfazed. Lin Daoqi was strong—far stronger than Zi Wu, whom he had faced before. Armed with a treasure-grade saber, his strength was undoubtedly within the top hundred of the Human Ranking.  

The failure of the *Limitless Sword Art's* ninth form to subdue him was no surprise—Dou Changsheng's cultivation was still lacking.  

But if one strike failed, what of ten?  

The *Five Qi Seal* suddenly opened, releasing the stored innate qi from one of its five apertures.  

Like a volcanic eruption, the qi surged forth, fueling another *Limitless Sword Art, Ninth Form*.  

The sheer volume of innate qi transformed into sword energy, manifesting as countless three-foot swords that blotted out the sky, drowning Lin Daoqi in an unrelenting tide.  

*Two thousand five hundred and eighty swords!*  

The sheer spectacle was overwhelming.  

The swords, each three feet long, filled the sky, turning the plaza into a world of blades.  

The sight left all who witnessed it in stunned silence.  

The Millennium Earth Pearl worked tirelessly to replenish Dou Changsheng's depleted dantian as the battle raged on.  

Lin Daoqi, who had leapt into the sky with such ease, now found himself unable to descend.  

His saber flashed, its edge cutting through the air with unparalleled force—yet for every sword he shattered, more took its place.  

Gradually, his resistance weakened.  

Wang Dingli, watching from the sidelines, could no longer remain idle. He stepped forward, his sleeve flicking out like a streak of white light as he intervened.  

Dou Changsheng's gaze shifted to Wang Dingli, then to Chen Weiquan and the others.  

The Hero's Sword, which he had held all this time, was finally drawn.  

With a single slash, he spoke calmly:  

"Come at me together."  

The intricate patterns on the Hero's Sword flared to life as Dou Changsheng unleashed the remaining four apertures of the *Five Qi Seal*, pouring every last drop of innate qi into the blade.  

The *Three Origins Convergence Art* surged, channeling the overwhelming flood of qi into the sword.  

The Hero's Sword blazed with radiant light.  

*Limitless Sword Art, Tenth Form!*  

This was Dou Changsheng's masterpiece—a technique that surpassed the *Limitless Sword Art* itself, born from the Divine Master's guidance and his own relentless refinement.  

This strike did not merely increase the number of swords to over five hundred.  

Its true brilliance lay in their illusory nature—real and unreal, shifting at Dou Changsheng's will.  

The tenth form was the *Phantom Sword*.  

Five hundred swords could appear as a thousand, their true and false forms indistinguishable.  

With the Hero's Sword amplifying his power, the world itself seemed to transform into a realm of blades.  

A river of sword qi surged toward the hall, engulfing Wang Dingli, Chen Weiquan, and every other member of the Righteous Alliance.  

This was Dou Changsheng's ultimate attack—a technique that transcended the Heaven-tier, ascending to the Mystic-tier.  

For someone like Chen Weiquan, who had reached the pinnacle of the Five Qi Convergence stage, such a technique was not insurmountable.  

But the sheer volume of innate qi behind this strike made it overwhelming.  

What appeared as one sword was, in truth, the force of ten.  

Dou Changsheng knew his limits—if all of them were as strong as Chen Weiquan, this attack would fail.  

But Chen Weiquan and Lin Daoqi were the strongest among them. The rest fell far short.  

Especially now, with Chen Weiquan's *Seven Injuries Fist* still incomplete, placing him at the fringes of the Human Ranking, and Wang Dingli not even having reached the pinnacle of the Five Qi Convergence stage.  

The hall's roof tiles shattered as the sword qi tore through the structure, sending debris flying like bullets.  

Chen Weiquan and the others were swallowed by the storm of blades.  

Then—  

A sudden gale erupted, sweeping the sword qi away in an instant.  

The figures within tumbled to the ground, their clothes torn, their bodies bloodied.  

Wang Dingli, disheveled and coughing blood, was a pitiful sight.  

The Qingyang Daoist, who had appeared unnoticed amidst the wreckage, stood with an air of authority.  

Dou Changsheng watched as the Divine Master effortlessly dispersed his attack with a single breath.  

Chen Weiquan touched the cut on his face—a blemish on his otherwise flawless features.  

But his shock overshadowed even his vanity as he stared at Dou Changsheng, his mind reeling with one thought:  

*How is he this strong?*  

Dou Changsheng sheathed the Hero's Sword and walked toward the Qingyang Daoist.  

As he passed Chen Weiquan and the others, he spoke softly:  

"Dragons do not dwell with snakes."  

Then, to the Qingyang Daoist, he said, "Elder, I am weary from my journey. I wish to rest."  

His five qi apertures were empty—he needed to recover immediately.  

Having made his display, it was time to lay low.  

After all, this was his weakest moment.
