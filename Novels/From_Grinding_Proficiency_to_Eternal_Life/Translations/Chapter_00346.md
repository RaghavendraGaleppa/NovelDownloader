# Chapter 346: The Storm Rises

"Two hundred years... a full two hundred years. Truly terrifying."

Guo Lang's throat squeezed out a hoarse, trembling voice.

Since the founding of Great Zhou, Nine-Realm experts had either passed away in blessed caves or fallen in sect disputes. True deaths were few and far between. When had there ever been a precedent where three died on the same day, all at the hands of the same person?

What was even more terrifying was that the few Nine-Realm old eunuchs secretly cultivated by the Imperial Court had also been ruthlessly slaughtered by Xu Yunfan.

More than ten record officials knelt behind Guo Lang, some even fainting from incontinence.

Three hundred zhang away, on the roof of a teahouse, a meddlesome swordsman's wine flask clattered to the ground.

The lay disciple of the Mituo Temple beside him had his teeth chattering.

"Didn't Master Granduncle say something about 'the Demon King descending upon the world'..."

Before he could finish, Xu Yunfan's icy gaze swept over. The entire street of martial artists took three steps back in unison, the sound of weapons dropping echoing one after another.

Xu Yunfan's face was as frost, yet a hint of lingering regret flashed in his eyes.

Although these three Nine-Realm masters were strong, they ultimately failed to force out his limits. The battle ended before he even had to use the Word of Mystery, Lin.

His body, infused with the Xuanhuang Qi, was like a bottomless abyss. The violent surge of Ten Extremities True Qi he had just unleashed had consumed less than thirty percent of his reserves.

Moreover, as the Ten Extremities Martial Way circulated through his flesh and blood, the surrounding stray spiritual energy of heaven and earth was rapidly devoured like a whale, restoring his depleted True Qi.

Xu Yunfan raised his head, his gaze like lightning, and instantly locked onto Guo Lang, who was hiding behind the ceremonial guard of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

The Director was currently slumped against a broken wall in the distance, his expression numb.

"Director Guo."

Xu Yunfan's voice carried the rumble of True Qi. Before the sound could even reach him, he had already appeared before Guo Lang.

"You advised the Empress to sacrifice thirty-six million lives with a blood ritual. Do you still remember those dried bones drained of their essence? You people... are truly worse than pigs and dogs."

A slight change came over Guo Lang's face. That blood ritual was precisely the method he had deduced using the *Burial Dragon Sutra* to "use human lives to patch the heavens' flaw."

Guo Lang did not辩解 (argue/explain), but simply stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan, then sighed, "You are the true variable."

*Boom!*

Before the mace tip arrived, the Ten Extremities True Qi had already crushed every bone in Guo Lang's body.

The moment the heavy mace lightly rested on Guo Lang's shoulder, his official robe exploded in the shockwave. True Qi poured into Guo Lang's seven orifices along the mace, and the Director immediately let out a inhuman scream.

His skin began to crack, and his残躯 (broken body) rapidly weathered into a charred bone wrapped in an official robe.

After finishing all this cleanly, Xu Yunfan glanced at the trembling Imperial Guard Commander. The expert saw Xu Yunfan's gaze sweep over and felt his whole body turn cold.

Seeing Xu Yunfan glance at him and turn away, the Commander had just let out a sigh of relief when a stone tore through the air with a sharp whistle. His vision went black, and he fell silent for good.

At this time, Xu Yunfan slowly walked towards the old steward huddled in the shadow of the broken wall. The sole of his boot ground over the still-wet bloodstains on the blue bricks, making a fine "creaking" sound.

The three hundred zhang distance was but a moment under his feet.

"Will the Martial Selection continue tomorrow?"

Xu Yunfan asked with his eyes lowered, his voice calm as if asking about the weather.

The old steward's withered fingers tightly gripped the competition schedule. The pages were still stained with blood spots sprayed from the distant Guan Shan Daoist.

He hunched his body, not daring to raise his head. His Adam's apple rolled several times before he squeezed out an answer, "The Martial Selection... the Martial Selection is a ancestral system of Great Zhou... as long as His Majesty has not issued an edict to stop it..."

"Very good."

Xu Yunfan cut off the man's trembling final words. As he turned, he glanced at the Great Zhou Imperial Palace.

His figure flickered slightly, and he vanished from the spot.

Jade Capital, deep within a palace of the Great Zhou Imperial Court.

"Report!"

An Imperial City司 (Department) secret agent, covered in blood, knelt outside the hall. "Guan Shan Daoist of the Xuanzhen Gate has had his vitality extinguished! Venerable Chu Sheng of the Nine Luminaries Sect was beaten to death by Xu Yunfan with a single mace... Yun Lan of Penglai... was nailed to death at the base of the training platform..."

This earth-shattering news made everyone present hold their breath, and the hall fell silent in an instant.

"Very good."

After a long while, the Empress suddenly let out a soft laugh.

This light laugh caused the temperature in the hall to drop sharply.

It was seen that the Empress slowly unfurled the blood-stained battle report. Upon hearing Xu Yunfan's results, everyone's hearts sank. This man was no longer human!

The Empress's hoarse voice sounded like an old branch swaying.

"With every victory Xu Yunfan achieves, another portion of Xuanhuang Qi is infused into him. By the time he steps into this Purple Extreme Hall..."

Her finger traced the withered dragon vein on the map of the nation, "What you gentlemen will be facing will be a Land Immortal who has drained the destiny of Great Zhou."

The aging Empress raised her head, looking at the gathered experts of the five major sects with a似笑非笑 (half-smile), seemingly caring not at all that the dragon vein of Great Zhou was being drained.

"This man is narrow-minded and vindictive, having walked out of that land of blood sacrifice. When he comes to settle accounts with you, your各大 sects will likely face destruction."

An elder in a purple robe from the Nine Luminaries Sect was the first to break the silence: "Xu Yunfan's Ten Extremities True Qi is no longer something that can be broken by human power. The Scorching Heaven Energy of our sect's Venerable Chu Sheng dissipated upon touching his body. This boy has likely touched the realm of the Ultimate Way."

He shook his hand and said indifferently, "There is still a 'Great Sun Falling Star Core' sealed at the bottom of the Nine Luminaries Pagoda. If activated by a secret method, it can summon celestial fire to burn his soul. This was left by our founder two thousand years ago when the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was abundant. However, the price is the complete destruction of the user. I'm afraid..."

A Taoist in a green robe from the Xuanzhen Gate sneered, "Which Nine-Realm expert from your sect is willing to die?"

He continued, "Our sect's Blue Cliff Xuanzhen Mirror can reveal the flaws in his True Qi operation, but it requires three people to form a formation to hold him off for a quarter of an hour... Now that Guan Shan Shixiong has fallen, the formation is incomplete. Unless the 'Celestial Pivot Sword Master' from the Sword Pavilion is willing to fill the position."

An elder with a white beard from the Sword Pavilion of the Jiangnan Dao snorted in anger, "The Celestial Pivot lineage practices the 'Way of the No-Life Sword.' When a sword is drawn, it must separate life and death! Where did we learn any formations... If Xu Yunfan dies, the desperate counterattack of the Dao Sect will surely be a full-scale retaliation. Who will go and block Bi Yuan then?"

Everyone began to议论纷纷 (discuss heatedly), arguing incessantly, yet none wanted to send anyone else out.

The Empress looked on, a hint of mockery flashing in her eyes.

The six major sects of Great Zhou, if they were to unite as one, would have long since rendered the Great Zhou court obsolete. This state of affairs was the norm. A莫名 (unexplainable) sense of pleasure arose in her heart.

At this time, the black mist on the sheath of the Cihard Karmic厄 (Suffering and Hardship) began to churn. "This old monk and two others can form the 'Three Talismans Lock Demon Formation.' We can use the Dragon Suppression Seal to temporarily sever his connection with the Xuanhuang Qi. This blade of ours can also catch him off guard."

Beneath his袭裟 (kasaya), dense blood-colored Sanskrit appeared. "The secret transmission of the Mituo Temple, the 'Vajra Subduing Demon Incantation,' can seal his True Qi for ten breaths... but it requires the Nine Luminaries Sect to detonate the Falling Star Core to break his physical defense."

The elder in the purple robe suddenly sneered, "The Master's calculations are truly exquisite! You want my sect's disciples to die, while you reap the benefits?"

He slammed the table. "Why don't we talk about the Dragon Suppression Seal first? This is a supreme treasure of the Great Zhou royal family. Is Your Majesty truly willing to part with it?"

"Of course, for it was I who bestowed it."

The Empress's expression carried a hint of amusement. "I can abandon the nation's destiny, let alone a single seal?"

Her gaze swept over everyone. "But if you gentlemen continue to hold back... in a few more days, I'm afraid even your mountain gates will be flattened by that Xu Yunfan."
