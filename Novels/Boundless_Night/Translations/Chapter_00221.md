Chapter 221: Renowned Throughout the Night Mist World

Cao Qianqiu's departure astonished all corners of the world. Along his path, mountains and rivers were stained crimson!

"Has Cao Qianqiu gone mad? What does he intend by making such a grand display?" Even Ancestor-level figures were startled. In fact, only those of that caliber dared to comment thus. Most others were simply awestruck, then fell silent, not daring to utter a sound.

Cao Qianqiu's might shook the Night Mist World; whenever he appeared, his every move would grace the front page of the Night Report. Primarily, his fearsome reputation was too great; every time he emerged from the Pure Land beyond the mundane, it would be accompanied by a storm of blood and gore. For years, he had acted with impunity, slaying founders of sects, cleaving through monsters aspiring to godhood, and rampaging across the land, making all factions exceedingly wary of him. In a sense, he embodied dominance, bloodshed, tyranny, and calamity, yet few could truly restrain him. Whenever he appeared in a certain region, all sects in that domain would instantly be on high alert, wondering if he had come to slaughter their gates and annihilate their factions.

Today, he was even more ferocious than usual, causing an unprecedented stir. He traveled by manifesting Pure Yang spiritual light, transforming into a colossal crimson sun that illuminated the earth, seemingly igniting even the pitch-black sky. Others navigating the Night Mist World were exceedingly cautious, for the darkness concealed many unknown dangers. Even Cao Qianqiu, in the past, would exercise some restraint when traversing the night mist, but today he was unusually blatant, showing no concealment, like a sovereign reigning over the world.

Along the way, a vast expanse of spiritual mountains, shrouded in colorful mist, with high-grade fire springs gushing, was occupied by a large sect. At this moment, the sect's high-ranking members were terrified! A crimson sun approached from afar with incredible speed, encountering their grand mountain gate without the slightest intention of veering away.

"He... he can't be coming for us, can he?!" At that moment, everyone felt as if they'd fallen into an ice cavern, their faces ashen. The pitch-black night sky turned blood-red as Cao Qianqiu arrived. The entire range of spiritual mountains trembled, and the guardian runes automatically revived, emitting blinding light. It was as if crimson lightning interwoven across the sky, scattering the night mist, making everyone feel as if their eardrums would burst. Their guardian runes were activated, but the crimson sun did not descend.

Cao Qianqiu's passage was like a god-like entity on the move, shaking heaven and earth! After he passed, the deafening roar continued incessantly. Even when encountering powerful Daoist traditions, he still crashed straight through, forging directly ahead without any intention of going around.

"Thank goodness... we weren't his target." It was a long while later before the Grand Elder of that great sect finally spoke. Other high-ranking members appeared calm, but their backs were already drenched in cold sweat. Such was Cao Qianqiu's fearsome reputation and power.

Beneath the night sky, a colossal high-grade heterodox creature spread its wings, its strong gales whistling as it pierced through clouds and mist. Its strength was exceptionally high, truly a monstrous demon of its domain. This creature's massive body was like a dark cloud, capable of covering mountains, and it had originally been soaring without a care in the world. However, its body now tensed, and all its feathers bristled, for it saw the pitch-black sky turn crimson. It tried to evade, but there was simply no time, as a powerful wave of spiritual light surged forth, clearing a path like a rushing tide. Its body stiffened, paralyzed, and then, it watched helplessly as a crimson sun drew near. In an instant, all its feathers were ignited by the Pure Yang light.

From within the crimson sun, Cao Qianqiu let out a cold snort. Seeing it obstruct his path, he simply delivered a kick, blasting the mountain-like bird's head into smithereens. Old Cao swept past, and the colossal headless bird corpse, illuminated by the crimson sun, disintegrated with a roar, turning into scattered ashes raining down upon the earth.

In a secret place, an old demon sat on a high platform, expounding the Dao. Suddenly, its expression drastically changed, and with a demonic wind, it swept up hundreds of its descendants, fleeing rapidly into the distance. "What's going on? Our ancestor has lived for nearly three hundred years and is revered in our domain. How could he be so panicked?" A young demon race member was astonished. Then, they saw a crimson sun blaze past their homeland, and their ancestor actually trembled slightly twice.

As Cao Qianqiu traveled, all corners of the Night Mist World watched with bated breath. All major powers were alarmed and were closely monitoring the situation. Soon, people discerned his trajectory: he was heading straight for Kunling!

In the Secret Realm, Qin Ming reunited with Gan Jincheng, Xiao Yaqin, and others. After emerging from that path, he returned to this original area. At this moment, he felt scorching gazes from the geniuses of several major academies, all looking at him with a dreamlike sensation, as if beholding a youthful deity. They were insiders, knowing that he was the young demon, having witnessed everything that transpired. Earlier, the unknown youth in their eyes had, after entering the Secret Realm, astonished them time and again, from slaying a "quasi-demon seed" to consecutively defeating immortal seeds. It was like a legend coming true, right beside them. Such battle achievements were simply too astonishing. Once word got out that this was the work of a youth on the New Path, it would undoubtedly shock the Night Mist World.

At this moment, even a proud genius like Xin Youdao was convinced, genuinely admiring the youth before him. Even though he had once swept through eighty-one cities, he now felt his own shortcomings. Before Qin Ming, what were those achievements worth? Jiang Ruoli, Gan Jincheng, Liu Hanhya, and the others were even more immensely shocked, their hearts stirring violently as they looked at the spirited youth, as if witnessing a rising sun ascending in the night mist.

"Brother!" At that moment, they, like Little Wu, directly called him "brother," even if the youth might be younger than them. Qin Ming quickly waved his hand, emphasizing, "Don't be like that, let's keep a low profile. Let's continue interacting as we did before."

Soon, Little Wu also returned, very excited, saying, "I gained a lot." Then, he lowered his voice and asked, "Brother, did you hit an old man? I was very close to your path and it looked like an old guy got smashed."

"We'll talk about it back home!" The group mentally prepared themselves not to show any unusual reactions.

From the outside, the Secret Realm appeared as a vast, moss-covered domain, with no mountains or giant trees visible. Yet, people continued to emerge from it. Outside, the situation was tense. Many great demons had arrived on the plateau, guarding one direction, receiving their young male and female kin. And experts from various Kunling academies had also arrived to welcome their disciples back. In the nearby domain, mountains and forests were crumbling, and the earth was cracked, clearly indicating a great battle had occurred. Even now, both sides remained at daggers drawn.

Pu Heng, with streaks of blood on his body, said, "You all should go back and prepare for the aftermath. It won't be long until you face that blade." On the opposite side, a colossal demon shrouded in night mist sneered, "Indeed, the rumors are true! You don't have Cao Qianqiu's fate, but you've caught his disease! Who do you think you are, a corpse? Can you really cleave through this plateau? Not even your master could!"

At this moment, the outside world was pitch black, completely different from the twilight scene within the Secret Realm. Towards the plateau, in the deep night, pairs of colossal and terrifying eyes opened—some blood-red, some blue, some eerie green—all exuding monstrous demonic energy!

"If my master arrives, all of you will be nothing but rabid dogs!" Pu Heng was seething with rage. He had already learned the truth from Li Qingxu: his master had been humiliated, and he had already reported it to his sect. Yet the demon race on the plateau didn't know that "their side's" young demon had once smashed Cao Qianqiu with a great hammer. If these great demons knew, they would certainly be even more ecstatic, and there's no telling what offensive words they might utter. Both sides temporarily restrained themselves; there was no major battle. This was because powerful figures were stationed behind each of them. For instance, the auspicious beast deep within the plateau and Sun Taichu above the clouds had once gazed at each other across the endless sky.

Youths emerged one after another from the Secret Realm. As Qin Ming, Little Wu, and the others walked out, they found themselves being scanned by a mirror. "'Demon-Reflecting Mirror!'" Xin Youdao exclaimed quietly. Someone was clearly uneasy and had all disciples thoroughly inspected. Qin Ming's expression was calm, but his heart skipped a beat. Fortunately, he had completely refined away his demonic aura beforehand; otherwise, even a trace would have caused trouble.

"Let's go, back home!" Two venerable elders from the Mountain River Academy's New Path, Zhao Ziyuan and Yu Gensheng, arrived personally to pick up young disciples such as Ling Yu, Xin Youdao, and Liu Hanhya. However, these youths knew that the two elders were actually primarily there for those two "unknown nobodies." Qin Ming and Little Wu blended into the crowd, inconspicuous.

Moments later, the flying ship ascended, traversing the night mist towards the Kunling domain. It was only a few hundred miles, not a great distance. "You all look full of vigor, and your inner vitality is even stronger. Was it relatively smooth?" Yu Gensheng asked kindly. He was so old that he had only a few strands of hair left, but he was one of the most powerful revered figures on the New Path in the Kunling domain.

"It was alright," Qin Ming replied.

Zhao Ziyuan sensed something unusual. "Hmm, nothing happened, did it? Don't worry, this flying ship is under the heavenly light of us two old men; you can speak freely."

"Well..." Qin Ming hesitated slightly but still spoke frankly, recounting the detailed experience. The two old men instantly turned to stone, unable to recover for a long while, feeling as if they were listening to a celestial book. The youth before them had beaten up Cao Qianqiu? They were both somewhat incredulous! Both held Qin Ming in high regard, considering him one of the beacons of hope for the New Path. In an era where Ancestors were destined to wither away one by one, he would be able to take their place in the future. However, neither of them had ever imagined he would be so heaven-defying! Even if he possessed extraordinary bone structure and exceptional talent, Cao Qianqiu's aptitude was also remarkable, and he commanded numerous sect-founding絕學, along with boundless insights and experience. They realized they had still underestimated the youth before them!

"You all go out first; we want some quiet," the two elders said.

Outside, Little Wu asked, "Brother, you hit Old Cao? If I had known it was him, I would have wanted to try too. What a regrettable miss!"

In the quiet room of the flying ship, Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan privately exchanged words, their voices trembling. "Heaven have mercy, does Heaven also know it has been too harsh on our New Path? It's extending our path's lifespan by sending us such a person!"

"Given Cao Qianqiu's personality, he will most likely come in person. He won't give up until he kicks a massive hole through this domain. This could cause unforeseen changes; we must prepare in advance!"

The flying ship successfully landed in Kunling City. Yu Gensheng reminded all the young disciples, "Recently, none of you should leave Kunling City. A drastic change could occur at any moment!"

"Brother, this time was truly great, a worthwhile trip!" Wu Yaozu was very excited, showing no fatigue at all. He mentioned that some of his techniques had been supplemented on that path.

"I gained a lot too," Qin Ming said, nodding with a smile.

"Since we just came out of the Secret Realm, my treat! Let's go have a big meal," Ling Yu called from behind. Xin Youdao and Liu Hanhya immediately agreed. Qin Ming and Little Wu thought for a moment, then also nodded and joined them.

"Senior Sister!" Ling Yu saw his senior sister, Tang Jin, and immediately stepped forward to greet her.

"I hear an extraordinary young demon appeared in the Secret Realm, consecutively defeating immortal seeds?" Tang Jin, clad in black, asked, her demeanor quite cold and stunning. Clearly, she had her own intelligence channels and already knew much beforehand.

Master Wu was also there, hovering in mid-air, his purple eyes shining brightly, saying, "Indeed, he is an unparalleled genius of our demon race, actually suppressing all other paths with just one path."

"How exactly is he?" Tang Jin asked Ling Yu.

"Very strong, his power defies the heavens; he should possess Ancestor-level aptitude!" Ling Yu earnestly informed her. At that time, he had been traveling with Zhao Muyao, Wang Lijie, and others, not with Xin Youdao, Jiang Ruoli, and the others. Therefore, even though he had suspicions, he ultimately dismissed them, not believing that the youth shrouded in demonic energy was related to Qin Ming.

"Such a formidable figure must possess the potential of a demon god. Do you feel the pressure?" Tang Jin, tall and graceful with an exquisitely flawless face, looked at the young men. Ling Yu knew that his senior sister primarily wanted to ask if the youths from Black and White Mountain felt any pressure.

"He's very strong!" Xin Youdao and Liu Hanhya's eyes gleamed as they spoke with immense admiration.

"He really is impressive!" Little Wu said.

"He's alright," Qin Ming chuckled.

"Just 'alright'?" Tang Jin glanced at him. Indeed, she had merely wanted to observe his reaction to gauge the true strength of that young demon. She frowned, wondering if the information was incorrect. Xin Youdao and Liu Hanhya felt uncomfortable holding back, but they had to remain calm and not show any strange expressions. They were direct witnesses; they were practically on the verge of looking at a certain youth with adoration.

Tang Jin glanced at Qin Ming and said, "You haven't entered the Outer Saint realm yet, have you? That means your spiritual light of consciousness is difficult to condense, making it impossible to step onto that path. How can someone who hasn't embarked on that path casually underestimate the strong figures on it?"

Ling Yu also spoke, his expression serious, "That young demon is truly formidable and must not be underestimated. In the future, he will likely be an incredibly terrifying mountain that our generation must face!" Tang Jin nodded. This aligned with the secret intelligence she had received. Now that the name "Demon One" was out, having single-handedly blocked multiple immortal seeds, he was bound to become renowned throughout the land.

Soon, a four-colored sparrow flew over, landing near the purple-eyed crow, reporting something. "Hiss, terrifying!" Master Wu shared the news with Tang Jin, informing her of the latest developments.

"So astonishing, he actually achieved such battle records!" Even Tang Jin was startled, quite shocked. She murmured to herself, "It certainly can't be kept secret; it's bound to spread throughout the land and shake the Night Mist World."

Qin Ming and Little Wu remained relatively calm, smiling faintly. Xin Youdao and Liu Hanhya, however, had words they wanted to say but couldn't utter. Upon hearing this, they immediately pressed for more information, indirectly fulfilling their desire to confide.

Tang Jin said, "Do you know that Cao Qianqiu actually made a move too, but he was defeated!"

Instantly, Xin Youdao and Liu Hanhya were stunned. This wasn't a realm they could comprehend. In the Secret Realm, they had no idea that light belonged to Cao Qianqiu, that Old Cao had performed a 'substitute' attack. They had thought they knew the truth and understood how powerful the youth beside them was, but now even more explosive news arrived, making them feel dizzy. Born in this era, who hadn't heard of Cao Qianqiu? They felt this was revolutionary. Even such a fearsome figure of his generation was not a match for the person before them in a peer-level duel?!

Ling Yu nodded in belated realization, "I see! It must have been that great battle with Li Qingxu. I kept wondering why his performance before and after had such a huge disparity in strength!"

Tang Jin sighed, "To actually defeat Cao Qianqiu, this Demon One is destined to become famous throughout the Night Mist World. As of today, his performance and all investigations into him will be delivered to the desks of all top major powers!"

Qin Ming revealed a look of surprise. So fast? Even Tang Jin, an outsider, knew. It seemed that Cao Qianqiu's action in the Secret Realm hadn't been concealed at all.

"What, now you know how formidable a demon seed is?" Tang Jin looked at Qin Ming, wondering if this youth, whom she had underestimated and who had always been keen on challenging her, was finally surprised.

"For him to receive such an evaluation from Fairy Tang, he is indeed formidable!" Qin Ming nodded. At this moment, even Little Wu felt a bit stifled, but he could only follow Brother Ming's pace, nodding earnestly and offering words of praise.

Tang Jin, with her cold and stunning aura, glanced at the youths and said, "You still don't understand the true value of a battle record like defeating Cao Qianqiu at the same level. That youth is either a born Battle Saint, incredibly skilled in combat arts, or possesses heaven-defying aptitude, perhaps even having the potential to surpass an Ancestor!"

In the Secret Realm, all factions had retreated. The remnant mirror glowed faintly, ripples spreading across its surface as it received a distant transmission.

"Cao Qianqiu is here; he's about to enter the Kunling domain!" It had to be said, this remnant Heavenly Demon Mirror, which could also be called an Immortal Mirror, was quite extraordinary, capable of receiving distant messages. It immediately vibrated, emitting dazzling light.

"Old cicada skin, are you leaving? That damned guy is here; I'm preparing to run," the remnant mirror said to the vast, mountain-like cicada shell. The cicada shell let out a chirping sound, as if in response.

"If you're not leaving, then don't." Patterns spread on both sides of the remnant mirror, extending into a pair of wings. Then, its surface glowed, and it began packing up various "resources."

"Aren't you lacking in sentience, long since senile?" The colossal cicada shell emitted a fluctuation.

The remnant mirror was no longer dull. "Do you really think I'm foolish? Bah, are you intentionally insulting me? I was merely feigning stupidity, investing in future pathfinders. Anyway, you're just a dead skin; I'm leaving you behind. I'm off." At this moment, it moved with great slipperiness, flapping its metallic wings and vanishing into the night sky.

"Do you think there's any connection between that young demon and Qin Ming?" Tang Jin secretly asked Master Wu; she had her suspicions. The purple-eyed crow said, "I also suspect it, but when I carefully sensed him, there was no demonic energy on his body, which doesn't match the aura of a demon-path cultivator constantly shrouded in demonic energy."

Boom! It was as if heaven and earth were collapsing. Crimson light dyed the night sky, and both sky and ground seemed covered by a magnificent sunset. The Kunling domain was ablaze with brilliance. Cao Qianqiu was approaching, appearing in this region! This caused an enormous sensation. In fact, no news of Cao Qianqiu's arrival in Kunling could have preceded him, as no form of communication was faster than his Pure Yang spiritual light. He did not, however, impose his might upon the city. He paused briefly, as if conversing with someone, and then departed, heading directly towards the plateau shrouded in night mist ahead. The crimson sun illuminated the mountains, rivers, and all creation ahead!

For a moment, Kunling City fell into a brief silence. Moments later, discussions erupted. Who could sit still upon realizing who had personally arrived, none other than Cao Qianqiu? "The recent rumors are true! Cao Qianqiu lost a wisp of Pure Yang spiritual light in that Secret Realm, and now he has come personally to kill!"

"My heavens, is that young demon going to defy the heavens? He defeated not just Li Qingxu, but also Cao Qianqiu! I'm inexplicably awestruck!" Kunling City was in an uproar, with all factions startled. Earlier, only whispers circulated, but now those events were undeniably confirmed. Demon One of the plateau instantly became the most frequently mentioned name, inextricably linked with Cao Qianqiu. Just as Tang Jin had said, the rise of Demon Seed Demon One had caused a huge stir and was destined to make his name known throughout the Night Mist World! Everyone knew that an earth-shattering battle was likely to erupt on the plateau; Cao Qianqiu's arrival would shatter the previous calm.

Tang Jin spoke, "My treat! Let's go to Listening Rain Pavilion on Wangxian Peak within Kunling City. From there, we might be able to view the great battle on the plateau." At this moment, Wangxian Peak was overflowing with people. If Tang Jin hadn't known the proprietor behind Listening Rain Pavilion, it would have been impossible to reserve a private room there. Kunling itself was situated on a plateau, and with Wangxian Peak being its highest point, Listening Rain Pavilion felt as if it rested among the clouds. In the private room facing the Secret Realm, both windows and doors were open, and many people were gazing out and discussing animatedly.

"They're fighting!" In this world of night, although the distance was great, that crimson sun was simply too dazzling, burning away the night mist, allowing them to see clearly. Cao Qianqiu unleashed his might, his first stop being the Secret Realm. Thousands upon thousands of crimson sunbeams descended, like lightning bolts falling from the Nine Heavens, piercing through the sky and earth.

Qin Ming sat in the private room. Upon seeing this scene, a hot current flowed through his pupils as he stared intently, his heart profoundly shaken. In this real world, Old Cao was simply overwhelmingly powerful! He had to sigh; this old madman was terrifying. Although detested by gods and ghosts, his true strength left one speechless. That piece of land seemed to have shattered, and that fragment of a star was pierced through by Cao Qianqiu!

"Old Cao's boasting actually came true." Although Qin Ming wished he could beat the old madman up again, he had to admit that the old fellow was swift and terrifying; he had come for revenge that very day.

A single cicada chirp, incredibly, resonated hundreds of miles away, startling everyone. What an enormous cicada, rising from the ground! A golden cicada glowed all over, filling the night sky, millions upon millions of golden rays illuminating all directions. Someone exclaimed in shock, "Hiss, is that the ancient cicada from Kunling's local legends? It's still in the world? How is that possible? That's a god-like being!"

"Look closely, it's just a cicada shell, not the cicada itself," an old master said. Subsequently, the cicada chirped, its terrifying thunderous sound blasting through the night sky. However, as Old Cao approached, a great spear appeared within the crimson sun, and with a 'thump,' he shattered a portion of the cicada shell. The cicada shell was golden throughout, but it was incomplete, already missing half a section. Now, with another fifth shattered, its situation became even more dire.

Boom! Its Zen aura was continuous, like a thunderous storm, and then the sound of chanting emanated. That entire piece of land sank and cracked, and the clouds and mist in the high heavens exploded. That scene was extremely terrifying; the old cicada shell actually possessed such power. However, the crimson sun blocked its cicada song and Zen aura. Cao Qianqiu stood within it, his red light surging to the heavens, seemingly immune to all phenomena. At this moment, runes interwoven within the crimson sun, extending a golden rope that rapidly stretched out, ensnaring the old cicada shell and binding it tightly.

Everyone was shocked. Cao Qianqiu's strength was too frightening. Had he already ended the battle right at the start? Tang Jin transmitted her voice: "See? That's how high the value is in the young demon defeating Cao Qianqiu." All the youths present nodded, but their feelings varied.

"Are you still calm?" Tang Jin looked at Qin Ming.

Qin Ming shook his head and said, "My heart has raging waves, and thunder echoes in my ears."

"Perfunctory," Tang Jin glanced at him.

Qin Ming responded with a voice transmission: "Actually, I know where that young demon eventually flew off to, Fairy Tang. What's the value of this information?"

Tang Jin said, "You want to trick me out of my Daylight Gold and rare merits?!"

"How could that be? I never do such things," Qin Ming shook his head.

On the plateau, the crimson sun sank. Cao Qianqiu took a step downward, and instantly, the plateau cracked, the earth subsided, and the Secret Realm he had pierced through further disintegrated.

"Stop!" Sun Taichu appeared, stepping forward to intervene, saying, "This Secret Realm still has great use. It contains a mustard seed within a Sumeru, and all its materials can be used for artifact refining."

"Where is Demon One? All you demons of the plateau, hand him over!" Cao Qianqiu declared. He truly didn't care what outsiders thought, being domineering and direct, simply demanding a young demon. Qin Ming fell silent. This was the real world, where Old Cao acted so unrestrainedly, living better and better, in the prime of his life, becoming increasingly terrifying. As for a battle on the same level, that was impossible. Old Cao's belief was to nip all dangers in the bud, and he would always exact revenge without delay.

"Do you wish to start a war now?" In the depths of the plateau, a pair of colossal golden pupils opened, terrifying to behold, like two suns appearing.

"So what if we do? This old man is here to punch through this plateau!" Cao Qianqiu stated grimly.

"Hold on, fellow Daoist. Hunting demons is fine, but please don't further damage this domain." A powerful figure from the Esoteric Sect appeared, also bathed in celestial light like a sun, hovering over the plateau.

"This old man is hunting demons; you dare to reach out and obstruct me, to meddle in my affairs?!" Cao Qianqiu showed no one any respect.

Boom! Suddenly, heaven and earth turned pitch black, and the entire Kunling domain trembled.
