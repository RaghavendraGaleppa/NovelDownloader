# Chapter 227: Meeting True Inheritance Senior Brother

“Isn’t that Young Master Yu? How could he— ”

At the periphery, a rogue cultivator from Sanyuan City recognized Zhang Jing and exclaimed in surprise.

“Young Master Yu? I’ve never heard of such a figure before.” Someone asked, puzzled.

However, no sooner had the words left their lips than someone else interjected, explaining, “Young Master Yu is a grand cultivator at the Golden Core stage who has recently emerged from our Sanyuan City’s Azure God Workshop. No one knows his origins, but his strength is formidable. Moreover, it’s said that he commands a mount, also at the Golden Core stage, and an Immortal Spirit at the Golden Core stage, making him extremely terrifying.”

“Wait!”

“Are you sure… that Young Master Yu only has one Immortal Spirit, and it’s at the Golden Core stage?” Someone pointed at the three Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits trailing behind Zhang Jing, radiating an overwhelming aura of chilling frost, and then spoke with a peculiar expression.

Just one glance at the Immortal Spirits behind this person made them feel as though their very souls would freeze. How could these possibly be at the Golden Core stage? And what’s more, there were three of them appearing at once!

For a moment, the numerous rogue cultivators on the periphery subconsciously held their breath, all staring with excitement at ‘Young Master Yu,’ who was now approaching Ling Shu Mountain. They instinctively felt that the contention for this spiritual land might yet see further changes. Not to mention the three terrifying Immortal Spirits, which subtly hinted at the extraordinary nature of his identity. More crucially, after the powerful existence from the Dongming Blessed Land of the Taiyi Immeasurable Dao Sect had already declared the ownership of Ling Shu Mountain’s spiritual land, this Young Master Yu still dared to intervene. This alone was enough to prove the matter.

Thud-thud—

Footsteps resounded incessantly, as if imbued with a certain rhythm, or perhaps carrying a magical allure. Upon reaching the ears of the crowd, they instantly captivated their entire attention.

Facing thousands of gazes, Zhang Jing walked slowly towards Ling Shu Mountain as if no one else was present. His eyelids lifted slightly, and a sharp glint suddenly flashed in his eyes.

In his line of sight, Ling Shu Mountain, now fully matured and formed, had undergone a drastic transformation since his last visit. The spiritual land, stretching for a hundred thousand *li*, was now enveloped by a dense spiritual mist that had appeared at some unknown time. Thirty-six treasured peaks, thousands of *zhang* high, were shrouded within the spiritual mist, exuding streams of heaven-reaching immortal light that drew in the immortal essence from countless *li* around.

The power of the earth veins! The power of the stars!

They faintly converged into myriad rivers, then, like all rivers flowing to the sea, directly surged into the spiritual land.

Seizing the essence of the sun and moon, gathering the cream of heaven and earth. It was nothing less than this.

“What a fine place! It wasn’t in vain that I waited for four long years.” Zhang Jing couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration. Having been in the Pure Azure Profound Heaven for decades, he finally had a place that truly belonged to him. It was truly hard-won.

***

On the other side, as Zhang Jing approached, the expressions and reactions of the crowd gathered at the foot of Ling Shu Mountain varied. Some who recognized or knew Zhang Jing intended to step forward and stop him, but upon noticing the three terrifying Immortal Spirits closely following behind him, they couldn’t help but pause, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Others unconsciously glanced at the golden-robed man who stood silently with folded arms, wearing an expression as if he were watching a good show. For most of the people present, they had already received enough shocks today and didn't mind one more.

Finally, the golden-robed man stepped forward, directly blocking Zhang Jing’s path. The reason he had not acted earlier was that he had sensed the spiritual energy fluctuations on Zhang Jing’s body, knowing that the other party was also a Daoist sect disciple. Especially after seeing the three Dharma Idol stage Immortal Spirits following behind him, he suddenly had some reservations.

However, as Zhang Jing’s face, which seemed to not see him at all, was reflected in his eyes, a trace of indignation welled up in the golden-robed man’s heart. He forcibly suppressed his anger and spoke in a deliberately calm tone: “This Junior Brother, you—”

But before he could finish his sentence, the golden-robed man’s voice abruptly cut off.

Opposite him, Zhang Jing smiled faintly and said gently, “Junior Brother, this spiritual land is where this Senior Brother intends to establish a Daoist-rite site. This time, I cannot yield it to you.” He then added, “You… shouldn’t have any objections, right?”

As he spoke, a purple-tinged chaotic Dao Seal slowly emerged from between his eyebrows. At the same time, a crimson immortal light flashed through Zhang Jing’s dark pupils, subtly revealing a terrifying saber intent that could incinerate heaven and earth and bear boundless karma.

In an instant, a terrifying sense of impending death flashed through the golden-robed man’s heart. He trembled, immediately realizing something. The next moment, he saw himself bowing to Zhang Jing with an excited expression, respectfully calling out, “Huang Jiulong greets True Inheritance Senior Brother. I did not know Senior Brother had arrived, please forgive my previous disrespect.” He then asked, “By the way, may I ask for Senior Brother’s esteemed name?”

“Crimson Bright Grand Radiance Grotto-Heaven, True Inheritance Zhang Jing.”

A faint smile flickered in Zhang Jing’s eyes, then he said, “Junior Brother, there’s no need for such formality.”

Upon hearing this, Huang Jiulong, the golden-robed man, cautiously greeted, “Huang Jiulong greets Senior Brother Zhang.” He then sensibly stepped aside. He understood clearly that since a True Inheritance disciple had taken a liking to this spiritual land, he should abandon his own hopes. As for why a dignified True Inheritance disciple possessed only a mere Golden Core stage cultivation—Huang Jiulong dared not ask, nor did he want to. Matters concerning True Inheritance disciples were not for him to inquire about.

Opposite him, Zhang Jing nodded. He said nothing more, merely slowly withdrew his gaze and continued walking towards the Ling Shu Mountain spiritual land.

With a single step, his figure instantly appeared before Ling Shu Mountain. In that moment, the dense spiritual mist shrouding the spiritual land transformed into a copper wall and iron barrier, as if instinctively repelling his entry. Zhang Jing’s eyes flashed. He immediately understood. This must be the innate grand formation within the spiritual land that he had seen last time, now taking effect.

“This is interesting. However, the spiritual land has only just finished maturing, and this innate grand formation is also in its nascent, most vulnerable stage.” Thinking this, he softly instructed, “Bing Feng, the three of you guard this place.”

“Yes, Master!” The three Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits closely following Zhang Jing replied without hesitation. With that, they remained in place, instantly transforming into three ice sculptures, unmoving.

On the spot, Zhang Jing gently exhaled a breath of turbid qi, then looked at the spiritual land before him, his gaze involuntarily sharpening.

“An innate grand formation that has just fully matured, with no one controlling it.”

“Although it’s almost certain that with the combined blessings of the Innate Grand Unity Heavenly Stars Myriad Gods Natal Realm, the Immortal Treasure Immortal Binding Chain, and the Grand Supreme Red Karma Immortal Slaying Demonic Blade, my full-power strike will definitely surpass the Golden Core stage and step into the Dharma Idol stage.”

“But to what extent it can reach is still unknown.”

“This is the perfect opportunity!” he thought to himself. A hint of anticipation flickered in his eyes.

Ever since he returned from the Proud Cloud Secret Realm last time, he hadn’t fought with his full strength. Strictly speaking, that wasn’t entirely true. Even someone as strong as Chang Jin in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm hadn’t forced Zhang Jing to use his full power. Thinking about it, the last time he used his full power was actually in the Lower Realm, in the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven?

Right, he seemed to have promised Lord Ying back then that he would bring them out of the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven when he had the capability.

A True Inheritance disciple… that should be possible, right? After this matter is concluded, he would go and give it a try. Zhang Jing thought to himself secretly.

His gaze flashed, and his thoughts instantly returned to reality. With a movement of his heart, a thunderous Daoist hum immediately resounded in his ears. The phantoms of thirty-six layers of heavenly worlds quietly appeared behind Zhang Jing, stacked one upon another, forming a terrifying, boundless, and resplendent immortal light halo. Especially the first layer of the world, streaks of scorching immortal light, wrapped in a faint, ethereal sacred aura, made him appear like a mighty deity.

Under the blessing of the thirty-six layers of heavenly worlds’ phantoms, Zhang Jing suddenly felt an immense, boundless power surging within his body—a terrifying force capable of suppressing the vast lands with a mere flick of his wrist. This wasn’t all.

Clatter—

The extremely heavy Immortal Binding Chain, glowing with a dense bronze immortal light, slowly emerged. A tangible baleful aura instantly spread in all directions. Zhang Jing gripped the Immortal Binding Chain with one hand. He abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze now a terrifying crimson, with tendrils of fire igniting deep within.

The Grand Supreme Red Karma Immortal Slaying Demonic Blade! This great divine ability, renowned for its fierce reputation across the myriad outer realms, immediately revealed its fierce and terrifying countenance the moment it appeared in Zhang Jing’s hand. Even without having forged the true Red Karma Immortal Slaying Demonic Blade, it could still unleash extremely terrifying power.

In an instant, the Immortal Binding Chain was stained by the crimson immortal light, transforming into a crescent saber. Majestic saber intent coiled around it, forming a profound blade edge.

Without a moment’s hesitation, Zhang Jing gripped the Immortal Binding Chain tightly and slashed forward directly.

Boom!

An intensely concentrated immortal light suddenly erupted. The entire vast Ling Shu Mountain began to faintly tremble.

Following that, a faint, unbearable cracking sound echoed.

***

Who knew how much time had passed. All movements completely vanished without a trace. Along with them, Zhang Jing’s figure also disappeared. Only the three ice-sculpture-like Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits remained, silently guarding the spot, adhering to Zhang Jing’s instructions.

And opposite the Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits, were the numerous cultivators, their expressions blank. Rogue cultivators, cultivators from the three major powers, and even the Taiyi Immeasurable Dao Sect disciples, including Huang Jiulong—all who had witnessed Zhang Jing’s strike without exception, were frozen in place, unable to stir for a long time.
