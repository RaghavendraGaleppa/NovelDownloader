# Chapter 129: Three Heads  

The warm atmosphere lingered for a long time. No words were needed, no other actions—just the beating of two hearts, allowing them to sense each other's closeness.  

"Ah, the spirit tea has gone cold!" Li Shiming suddenly remarked after a long while.  

His words broke the mood. Yin Shilan chuckled and rolled her eyes at him playfully. Though unspoken, their relationship had grown even closer.  

"How do I use this?" Li Shiming refilled Yin Shilan's cup with spirit tea and picked up the talisman treasure, asking.  

He didn't stand on ceremony—this was a token of Yin Shilan's affection. When he gained enough strength in the future, he would prepare something for her in return.  

"Just activate it with spiritual energy. This talisman treasure can be used three more times. Note that each activation requires three breaths of preparation time," Yin Shilan explained.  

Li Shiming nodded. The usage was simple, though the three-breath preparation time felt a bit long.  

"How powerful is it?" he asked. While he knew talisman treasures carried a fraction of a magic treasure's might, he still needed Yin Shilan to elaborate.  

"The power of a talisman treasure depends on the magic treasure it's derived from. A single strike from this 'Sky-Piercing Bow' talisman treasure can overwhelm early and mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators and even pose a threat to late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators," Yin Shilan patiently explained.  

Li Shiming inhaled sharply. Even though he had speculated about the talisman treasure's power, he hadn't expected it to be this terrifying.  

With such a talisman treasure in hand, he could kill three early or mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. If talisman treasures were abundant, what purpose would Foundation Establishment cultivators even serve?  

"The process of extracting part of a magic treasure's power to create a talisman treasure permanently diminishes the magic treasure's strength, and its owner—a Golden Core cultivator—also suffers damage. The sect's talisman treasures are all made by Golden Core seniors on their deathbeds to leave for their descendants. This 'Sky-Piercing Bow' talisman treasure was obtained in exchange from a Golden Core descendant," Yin Shilan explained further, her insight sharp as she noticed Li Shiming's thoughts.  

She had given him the talisman treasure for self-defense, not for indiscriminate killing, so she emphasized its rarity.  

Li Shiming nodded solemnly. For a Golden Core cultivator to permanently weaken their magic treasure and suffer personal damage just to create a single talisman treasure spoke volumes about its value.  

At the same time, this rarity reflected the depth of Yin Shilan's feelings, making him feel the weight of her affection.  

"I encountered something strange and was just about to ask you about it," Li Shiming changed the subject. "A sea of starlight has formed in my mind, and all the knowledge I've learned about formations has turned into stars."  

Yin Shilan's almond-shaped eyes widened in surprise.  

She knew exactly what this meant—she had only achieved this state herself after her enlightenment with Li Shiming.  

Even though she recognized his extraordinary talent in formations, she hadn't expected him to comprehend the sea of starlight so quickly.  

"You've realized the sea of starlight—this is a transformation for formation masters. The sea of starlight is a prerequisite for advanced formation masters. Without it, it's impossible to set up high-level formations. I believe you've already sensed this," Yin Shilan said, her expression focused as she spoke about formations.  

"So that's how it is," Li Shiming nodded.  

The computational demands of high-level formations were immense. Without the sea of starlight's properties, temporary calculations would be insufficient to handle the vast computations required for advanced formations.  

Of course, this didn't apply to him, given his IBMz15. This was also why Yin Shilan held him in such high regard—even before developing the sea of starlight, he had possessed unparalleled computational power.  

The sea of starlight was useless for new formations, so formation masters needed to continuously study, adding vast amounts of formation experience to the sea to handle the computations of various high-level formations.  

"You're already qualified to take the intermediate formation master exam. From now on, you can join me on missions," Yin Shilan said with a bright smile.  

"I'll wait a little longer—I need to consolidate my formation knowledge first," Li Shiming replied with a regretful expression, as if reluctant to miss the chance to work with Yin Shilan.  

Though he declined the intermediate formation master exam, Yin Shilan didn't take offense.  

Li Shiming had too much on his plate—his schedule was packed with tasks, and the intermediate formation master exam would have to wait until he had more free time.  

Moreover, his cultivation level was still too low, and he didn't want to draw too much attention.  

After a reluctant farewell to Yin Shilan, both savored the time they spent together, but they understood that cultivators needed to manage their own time.  

Li Shiming then sent a message to Yun Ze, placing another order for goods.  

"Junior Brother Li, while the 'Thousand-Mile Mutual Vision' sales are doing well, once the market saturates, your spirit stone income will drop. You need to think about the future," came Yun Ze's usual admonishment.  

This didn't affect Li Shiming's order. Yun Ze knew such advice was futile, but as a friend, he still felt obliged to offer it.  

Li Shiming smiled as he read the message on his identity jade slip. Senior Brother Yun Ze had no idea about the cutthroat nature of the business world in his past life—he had plenty of ways to earn spirit stones.  

But for now, the most important thing was to stick to his plan.  

He returned to the underground space, where three corpses and the copper corpse lay within the 'Netherworld Ghost Domain Formation.'  

The three corpses belonged to Foundation Establishment cultivator Kui Yun, a Qi Refinement seventh-layer cultivator, and a Qi Refinement eighth-layer cultivator.  

Among them, Kui Yun's corpse was badly damaged, with only his bones intact.  

At the moment, all three corpses were covered in medicinal liquid, nourished by the yin-cold spiritual energy within the formation.  

Li Shiming connected his consciousness to the IBMz15. After testing the power of the mid-grade Gatling artifact, he became even more determined to proceed with his plan.  

The mid-grade Gatling artifact was powerful, but it fell far short of his expectations.  

A single mid-grade Gatling artifact had cost him a full 10,000 spirit stones. Even though he considered himself wealthy, this was still a significant sum.  

And that 10,000 didn't even include the cost of the formations and enchantments.  

Yet, the mid-grade Gatling artifact couldn't even quickly eliminate a Qi Refinement eighth-layer cultivator, which disappointed him.  

The solution was simple: increase firepower.  

If one mid-grade Gatling artifact wasn't enough, then two. If two weren't enough, then more.  

Of course, mid-grade Gatling artifacts required control. Even though the copper corpse had two hands, it could only operate two at most.  

From the IBMz15's database, he had come across a paper by a young medical graduate student—an unconventional thesis that gave him great inspiration.  

"On the Feasibility of Three Heads and Six Arms in Medicine." Just the title alone suggested the student wasn't entirely serious.  

The young medical graduate had been inspired by a pair of conjoined twins with two heads and four arms who had survived into adulthood.  

He theorized whether the legendary "three heads and six arms" might also have been a case of conjoined deformity and conducted a theoretical study on the subject.  

Though the topic sounded like folklore, the content was rigorously scientific.  

It was this paper that gave Li Shiming the idea for modifying the copper corpse.  

His fear of insufficient firepower could be solved with six mid-grade Gatling artifacts. At 180 ice crystal bullets per second, could any Qi Refinement late-stage cultivator withstand that?  

Transforming the copper corpse into a three-headed, six-armed entity had been analyzed by the IBMz15 and deemed theoretically feasible.  

The biggest challenge in body modification was rejection—even if two bodies were perfectly compatible, unknown rejection reactions could still occur.  

This was especially true for head-related surgeries, which were essentially head transplants. In his past life, such procedures had only resulted in short-term survival at best.  

But Li Shiming was confident he could succeed because he wasn't modifying a living human—he was working with a copper corpse.  

The copper corpse didn't have to worry about rejection or surgical risks. At worst, he could simply restore it to its original state.  

With the 'Netherworld Ghost Domain Formation,' any damage to the copper corpse would quickly heal.  

His recent outing had yielded two intact Qi Refinement late-stage corpses, perfect for the modification. When collecting them, he had already treated them with preservatives.  

Before officially modifying the copper corpse, Li Shiming planned to strengthen it first.  

After all, he now had the bones of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Replacing the copper corpse's bones with these would, after assimilation by the formation, make it even stronger.  

The foundation of all this was the 'Netherworld Ghost Domain Formation.' Without it and the corpse modification technique he had obtained from Ren Fei'er, he wouldn't have even considered this path.  

The copper corpse was brought into the server room space, where the third-grade sword base transformed into a scalpel.  

Given the copper corpse's current defenses, only a third-grade weapon like the sword base—or a spirit artifact—could easily penetrate it.  

He did possess spirit artifacts, but without the spiritual energy to control them, they were useless to him.  

The third-grade sword base was perfect—its material alone allowed it to effortlessly cut through the copper corpse's defenses without requiring spiritual energy.  

Li Shiming started with a small experiment, replacing a single foot bone from the copper corpse with one from the Foundation Establishment corpse.  

The surgery was quick, and once completed, he moved the copper corpse back into the formation.  

The 'Netherworld Ghost Domain Formation,' crafted from third-grade spiritual materials, was exceptionally effective at strengthening a Qi Refinement-level copper corpse.  

If not for the copper corpse's own absorption limits, the formation alone could have rapidly elevated it to the iron corpse level.  

In just a few months within the formation, the copper corpse had advanced from Qi Refinement seventh-layer to eighth-layer, showcasing the formation's potency.  

But now, Li Shiming truly grasped the formation's power. After performing the modification technique on the replaced foot bone, it took less than ten minutes for the bone to fully integrate with the copper corpse's skeleton, becoming a true corpse bone.  

Upon inspection, the foot bone was noticeably harder than the others—almost as if it had reached the level of an iron corpse's bones, if not quite there yet.  

This initial experiment bolstered his confidence, and he proceeded step by step to replace the copper corpse's bones.  

From feet to head, even the skull was carefully disassembled and replaced.  

Only the server room space, with its micron-level precision, could accomplish such a feat. Outside, the failure rate would have been terrifyingly high.  

Even for a copper corpse, the brain housed the corpse spirit. A single misstep could damage it, destroying the copper corpse's soul. The risks of skull surgery were immense, as emphasized in the modification technique's warnings.  

The technique strongly discouraged modifying a corpse's head due to the high historical failure rates, serving as a caution to later generations.  

Though Li Shiming appeared bold, every step was meticulously calculated. After replacing each bone, he placed the copper corpse in the formation and performed the modification technique.  

By the end of the first phase, the copper corpse still emitted a Qi Refinement eighth-layer aura, but its skeleton had been upgraded to near-iron corpse level.  

This skeleton would accelerate the copper corpse's growth within the formation, bringing it closer to becoming an iron corpse.  

However, Li Shiming wouldn't let it advance too quickly. The copper corpse wasn't his life-bound corpse—its controllable strength was limited to the Qi Refinement stage. Beyond that, it might rebel or even break the blood contract to attack its master.  

The second phase began. The copper corpse was returned to the server room space, this time accompanied by the two Qi Refinement late-stage corpses.  

The three-headed modification involved splitting two additional cervical vertebrae from the seventh vertebra, sharing the spine below. The pelvises of the two additional corpses were repurposed as reinforced shoulder blades to support the extra arms.  

Though the copper corpse was undead with strong regenerative abilities and the formation's support minimized flaws, Li Shiming still meticulously connected every nerve, blood vessel, and even the tiniest capillaries.  

The three heads of the copper corpse each controlled their own pair of arms. The original head was simpler, but the two new heads introduced unprecedented complexity.  

Fortunately, Li Shiming performed the surgery with micron-level precision in the server room space. The task was tedious but not difficult.  

The two new heads and four arms—from bones to nerves to muscles—were all connected. The medical graduate student would never have imagined his wild thesis being realized in another world by Li Shiming.  

Li Shiming sutured the skin using cosmetic stitching techniques, treating it as surgical practice.  

Of course, this was mostly showing off. Even without an audience, he had once admired surgeons in his past life. Now, not only did he possess surgical skills, but he had achieved a level no one in his previous world could match.
