# Chapter 135: Chaos Tonight! The Origin of the Debt Collector!

After Gao Xuan, a second person emerged alive from the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven?

Initially, Li Zhengjing had intended to spare Gao Xuan's life, but after delivering his final strike, Gao Xuan had already breathed his last. In the subsequent battles, Gao Xuan's corpse was left in pieces—utterly dead—making it impossible to extract any details about the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven.

Regarding the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven, Li Zhengjing harbored many questions in his heart.

Now, hearing that another person had returned alive, he couldn't help but feel a stir.

"Gao Xuan had half a sword blade inside him?"

"Could this person have the other half of the immortal sword?"

"Previously, those who entered the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven were all sent by the imperial court. Now, this person must have fallen into the court's hands."

"Should we seize the opportunity to abduct this person amid the chaos tonight? It's bound to be chaotic..."

Li Zhengjing wore the mask of a Wuchang ghost, making his expression unreadable, but his eyes remained calm.

The Divine King of Northern Suppression spoke slowly, "Gao Xuan, the first to obtain the opportunity from Yanguan Mountain, was incredibly powerful—something you know best, since his opportunity ended up with you! But within Yanguan Mountain, there must be more than just one opportunity, right?"

He looked at Li Zhengjing and said, "The descent of the Heavenly Star brings unpredictable fortunes—there are dangers within, but also opportunities... This person is currently the only one who can reveal to us what truly lies inside the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven!"

He paused before continuing, "This man is an old soldier from the imperial army, merely at the Internal Qi Realm. Now that he has returned, he naturally falls into the hands of the Great Zhou Dynasty's court. But the Great Zhou court won't hand him over easily..."

This person's background involved the opportunities within the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven.

Would the three great immortal sects, the two Buddhist schools, the various Daoist factions, and the six loose immortal ancestors truly stand by quietly and let the Great Zhou court take him away?

Moreover, even if these factions weighed the pros and cons and chose to remain silent, those who sought to stir the pot and fish in troubled waters would hardly sit idly by.

For example, the Great Xuan Dynasty, the Great Yan Kingdom, and the Golden Ship of World Salvation—they would all be eager to plunge the situation into further chaos!

"You came to Yanguan Mountain precisely to investigate the situation inside the Cave Heaven, didn't you?"

The Divine King of Northern Suppression spoke slowly, "Everyone gathered here is here to uncover the truth within and seize more opportunities! Although you've had some conflicts with our Great Xuan Dynasty in the past, those were minor matters. Besides, the Mirror of Xuanzhao has already fallen into your hands... Cooperating with me now is the only way to avoid becoming a pawn!"

He pointed at the surrounding cultivators and said, "Look at them—mere ants, here to fish in troubled waters, foolishly hoping for a sliver of opportunity. But in truth, they are all pawns!"

"They think that under the so-called protection of their loose immortal ancestors, they might get a share of the spoils. But those who truly rose from the bottom—would they ever protect such people?"

"Among the twelve loose immortal ancestors of the Central Continent, which one didn't come from humble origins? Which one didn’t rely on ruthless decisiveness, even unscrupulous means, to rise above the masses?"

The words of the Divine King of Northern Suppression left Li Zhengjing in silence.

Aside from the experts of the major factions, the six human immortals present here were all rogue cultivators—without large factions or outstanding subordinates to command.

Thus, these rogue cultivators before them were all pawns of the six loose immortal ancestors.

For the elders of immortal sects, they might still show some consideration, as these were their own sect's disciples, nurtured by the sect.

But for loose immortal ancestors, these rogue cultivators were unrelated to them—mere tools to be discarded at will if necessary.

"Think it over carefully. Tonight, I will come to find you."

"..."

Li Zhengjing watched his departing figure without a word.

Inside the Wutong wooden box, the voice of Guigulingguan came through.

"None of them are good people. We must consider carefully."

"There's no need to consider. We didn't come here solely for the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven."

Li Zhengjing lowered his voice, "If I get involved, I’ll likely be sold out afterward..."

At present, the Zhengjing Immortal Venerable and the Great Zhou Dynasty were not on the same side, but neither were they enemies!

In the capital, although he had killed the Crown Prince and the Third Prince, he had also struck a deal with the Grand Preceptor, helping the Great Zhou Dynasty salvage its reputation.

In Hongshan Town, although there had been conflicts with the court's forces, the enmity was not irreparable—at least, it hadn’t yet reached a life-or-death level.

Now, the Zhengjing Immortal Venerable enjoyed a prestigious reputation among rogue cultivators. If he were used as a pawn and forced to openly break with the Great Zhou Dynasty, he would become a wanted man.

At that point, the Great Xuan Dynasty could take him in, leveraging his reputation to rally rogue cultivators across the land, offering them benefits to join the Great Xuan Dynasty!

"It seems having too good a reputation isn’t necessarily a good thing," the Wall-Hanging Bird sighed. "If not for Master’s illustrious name and immense influence among rogue cultivators, they wouldn’t have set this trap to force us into breaking with the Great Zhou Dynasty."

"But for someone like Master—kind-hearted, benevolent, and virtuous—staying low-key isn’t easy," the Five Elements Creation Tree chimed in.

"..." Hao Jian thought to himself, "Rumors! All rumors! The outside world spreads nothing but hearsay!"

"Wait a moment..."

At this moment, Guigulingguan spoke up, "I think I heard something. Move the carriage a bit to the west—the Venerable Jingxu seems to be over there..."

Li Zhengjing complied, steering the carriage westward.

Guigulingguan’s ears came from a demon immortal with divine abilities, allowing him to hear nearby movements without using magic and alerting others.

Inside the tent, the Venerable Jingxu sat cross-legged, his magic power forming a barrier to block external perception.

This six-hundred-year-old loose immortal ancestor appeared no older than sixty.

But before him sat a massive white rat, draped in a cloak, sitting on the ground with human-like mannerisms.

One of the Twelve Demon Gods of the Golden Ship of World Salvation—White Rat!

"Has the White Lord found any clues?"

"Nothing," White Rat spoke in human tongue. "Using the Golden Ship’s secret methods, I’ve scoured the surroundings but found no trace of the Heavenly Venerable’s legacy. What about you?"

"I’ve also found nothing," the Venerable Jingxu said gravely. "Did the Heavenly Venerable truly leave his legacy near Yanguan Mountain?"

"This third-generation Heavenly Venerable was inscrutable. Back then, he stripped us of our authority with ruthless methods," White Rat said. "But one thing is certain—he keeps his word. So the legacy and token must be nearby."

"Could someone have already taken them?" the Venerable Jingxu pondered.

"No," White Rat replied. "His schemes run deep. He must have anticipated many variables. If he decided to leave his legacy and token, outsiders wouldn’t find them—only those under the Golden Ship could detect them. Moreover, without the Golden Ship’s secret methods, his legacy would appear no different from ordinary objects—perhaps just a rock, a branch, a bird, or even an insect!"

"But even you couldn’t find anything?" The Venerable Jingxu frowned.

"That’s to be expected," White Rat said. "The Heavenly Venerable’s token and legacy are matters of immense importance. How could they be easily discovered? What if someone like Guigulingguan—obsessed with medicine and oblivious to all else—found them? Would we have to bow to him as the fourth Heavenly Venerable?"

"True. Only those who overcome the difficulty of finding the legacy and token are truly worthy of inheriting the Heavenly Venerable’s mantle," the Venerable Jingxu agreed.

Meanwhile, inside the carriage.

From the Wutong wooden box, Yuan Zhengfeng’s voice came through.

"Don’t get angry, don’t get angry. Calm down, old man..."

"Uncle, we’ll roast that rat later. Now’s not the time," the Wall-Hanging Bird coaxed.

"Bird Lord is right. You’re over six hundred years old—why get worked up over being called a waste by a rat?" the Five Elements Creation Tree chimed in.

"White Rat, how dare it badmouth me behind my back? If I hadn’t saved it back then, would it even be alive today?" Guigulingguan seethed.

"Elder Guigu, calm down," Li Zhengjing said softly. "Earlier, you mentioned that the Heavenly Venerable’s legacy and token might be disguised—hidden in rocks, branches, or even living creatures? That’s why the Golden Ship’s people haven’t found them?"

"Exactly," Guigulingguan said. "The third-generation Heavenly Venerable was a schemer. His legacy won’t be easily found."

"But it’s not entirely impossible to find, right?" Li Zhengjing mused.

"Of course not. Otherwise, if no one in the Golden Ship could find it, wouldn’t they be left leaderless?" Guigulingguan replied.

"Then I think I have a direction," Li Zhengjing said.

"What direction—wait?"

Guigulingguan paused. "They said the Great Zhou Dynasty’s Divine General Yuanjin is also a member of the Golden Ship? Since when? What position does he hold?"

After a moment of silence, Guigulingguan’s tone turned grave. "Tonight, they plan to abduct that old soldier amid the chaos to interrogate him about the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven and the whereabouts of the third-generation Heavenly Venerable?"

Li Zhengjing suddenly understood. "So there’s a mole. No wonder they dare to abduct someone!"

Back in the tent, the Venerable Jingxu and White Rat concluded their discussion.

White Rat sighed helplessly. "It’s so uncomfortable not being able to show my true form."

It picked up a human skin from the ground and draped it over itself.

Then it donned a Daoist robe—clearly the attire of an inner disciple of the Yuhua Immortal Sect—and hung a silver token at its waist.

In an instant, it had transformed into an inner disciple of the Yuhua Immortal Sect.

"Tonight, I’ll use this identity to attack the imperial army, provoking conflict between the Great Zhou military and the Yuhua Immortal Sect."

White Rat looked over. "Tonight, you keep an eye on Yuanjin."

The Venerable Jingxu’s heart stirred. "You’ve found a lead?"

White Rat replied, "I suspect Yuanjin, using his authority in the Great Zhou military, has already found a clue. But because we’re all watching each other, he doesn’t dare act. Once chaos erupts tonight, he’ll evade everyone’s notice and secretly retrieve the Heavenly Venerable’s token and legacy, then refine it!"

With that, the human-shaped White Rat left the tent and headed toward the Yuhua Immortal Sect’s encampment.

Meanwhile, in the carriage, Guigulingguan relayed all he had heard.

"So there is a lead after all."

Li Zhengjing nodded. "Let’s plan our moves for tonight."

The old soldier who emerged from the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven would undoubtedly be the focal point of the turmoil, with factions vying for him.

Given Li Zhengjing’s current fame and formidable strength, acting rashly would make him a target for all.

In contrast, the Heavenly Venerable’s legacy and token were known only to the Golden Ship’s inner circle.

Moreover, the Golden Ship’s members were monitoring each other.

If Divine General Yuanjin truly had a lead on the legacy’s location and planned to retrieve it secretly, this was their chance.

"The old soldier from Yanguan Mountain will draw everyone’s attention. The battle will be fierce."

"Over at the Heavenly Venerable’s legacy, any conflict will be limited to a few key players. We can exploit that."

"Then we’ll focus on the Venerable Jingxu."

Li Zhengjing declared, "No matter how chaotic it gets outside tonight, we won’t interfere."

Yuan Zhengfeng sighed. "What a pity for these rogue cultivators—pawns in the factions’ power struggles, manipulated at will."

Guigulingguan said indifferently, "They came here knowing the risks, gambling for a sliver of hope. Even if they don’t obtain Yanguan Mountain’s opportunity... a few lucky ones might still profit."

Yuan Zhengfeng was puzzled. "What do you mean?"

Li Zhengjing understood immediately. "In the chaos of battle, casualties are inevitable. Even if no human immortals or deities perish, many Qi Refinement Realm cultivators will die. For ordinary rogue cultivators, as long as they survive, they can scavenge techniques, spells, spirit stones, talismans, and artifacts from the fallen. Isn’t that an opportunity in itself?"

The Wall-Hanging Bird chimed in, "If a few human immortals die and drop from the sky, it’d be like treasure troves falling from heaven for ordinary cultivators!"

"Opportunities are everywhere."

Guigulingguan instructed, "Tree, you’re the best at disguise, and you have the Mirror of Xuanzhao for protection. When chaos erupts, see what you can scavenge..."

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches in acknowledgment.

Just then, someone approached, walking past the carriage.

But a voice reached them.

"The Young Master requests your presence."

Li Zhengjing studied the man’s back.

His attire was plain, bearing no faction’s insignia.

But Li Zhengjing knew where he came from. Placing the Wutong wooden box inside the carriage and instructing Hao Jian to guard it, he followed the man alone.

Hao Jian, at the peak of the Qi Refinement Realm, sat outside the carriage, deterring any who might approach.

Li Zhengjing trailed the man to a tree, where another figure stood with his hands behind his back.

"Even with this Wuchang mask, you recognized me?"

Li Zhengjing stepped forward, removing the mask. "I heard the current sect master of the Kunlun Immortal Sect left the Central Continent, and you’re acting in his stead?"

"Yes."

The Kunlun Young Master glanced at him. "The Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi within you is sharper than before. Though you’ve concealed your aura, human immortals wouldn’t detect it at a glance. But I’ve cultivated the same sword qi."

He mused, "Aside from you, I’m the one most familiar with this sword qi in the world. You can hide from others, but not from me."

After a pause, he scrutinized Li Zhengjing. "You’ve reached the peak of the Qi Refinement Realm, your sword qi a hundred times sharper than mine was. Is this due to Yanguan Mountain’s opportunity?"

Li Zhengjing didn’t deny it. "Yes."

The Kunlun Young Master hesitated before continuing, "With such sharp sword qi, you can’t blunt its edge. The path I took to human immortality won’t suit you."

"I have a new path," Li Zhengjing said.

The Kunlun Young Master fell silent before asking, "Can you truly become a sword immortal with the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi?"

Li Zhengjing nodded. "Yes."

The Kunlun Young Master sighed. "Throughout history, only the Tianqing Dao Sovereign has mastered this sword art. Now, there’s you—both possess the Eternal Verdant Sacred Body. No wonder our sect’s teachings say only those with this body may cultivate it."

Li Zhengjing pondered before suddenly asking, "I have a question. The Kunlun Immortal Sect only had the Tianqing Dao Sovereign master this sword art, yet it existed in the sect before him..."

He looked at the Kunlun Young Master. "This art wasn’t created by Kunlun’s ancestors. Where did it originate?"

The Kunlun Young Master didn’t answer immediately, seemingly deep in thought.

In the past, he would have either answered directly or refused outright.

But now, as the next sect master, he hesitated.

After a long pause, he finally spoke. "Help me tonight. Once it’s done, I’ll tell you about the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi... and the origin of the Debt Collector."

Li Zhengjing’s gaze sharpened. "What’s happening tonight?"

The Kunlun Young Master said calmly, "Remember that half-dog?"

Li Zhengjing frowned. "The Five Pecks Divine King?"

The Kunlun Young Master nodded. "I intended to track it to uncover the Golden Ship’s location. But with the Heavenly Star’s descent, I had to return to the sect and captured it early. It’s now imprisoned in Kunlun’s back mountain. It received word that the third-generation Heavenly Venerable left his token and legacy near Yanguan Mountain..."

He continued, "I don’t care about the token, but I want to know if the Debt Collector is still here."

He looked at Li Zhengjing. "Tonight, amid the chaos, I’m entering the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven."

Li Zhengjing’s expression shifted. "The Heavenly Star’s descent makes the Cave Heaven’s interior unknown and perilous. You’d risk it?"

The Kunlun Young Master said firmly, "Gao Xuan and that old soldier emerged alive. Even the third-generation Heavenly Venerable dared to enter. Why should I fear it?"

Li Zhengjing waved his hands. "The situation inside isn’t what you think. There’s—"

The Kunlun Young Master raised a hand. "Annihilation Qi."

Li Zhengjing froze. "You know about it?"

The Kunlun Young Master nodded. "The origin of the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi is linked to Annihilation Qi. If you want to know more, you’ll have to guide me in... Otherwise, if I die inside, you’ll never learn the truth."

"Deal!"
