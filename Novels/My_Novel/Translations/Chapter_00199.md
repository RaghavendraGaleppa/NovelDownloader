# Chapter 199: The Madam Is Jealous? An Opportunity to Discipline

After the Madam relaxed her control, Li Xian felt like a fish returned to water, indulging in freedom and pleasure, thoroughly enjoying himself. Meanwhile, the Madam spent her energy managing the "golden scales in the pond," contemplating the principles of the arts.

Today, after finishing her tasks, she felt joyful but also deeply realized that her "Silk Garment Misplacing Jade Technique" had been neglected for too long. Her proficiency had regressed considerably.

She casually asked Uncle Xiang about Li Xian's recent situation. She learned that although he had not neglected his martial arts, his playful nature led him to ride his horse galloping about, sometimes admiring the scenery, sometimes visiting old places. She couldn't help but smile inwardly; when young men get too caught up in play, they inevitably forget to return home.

Madam Wen said, "The wind and snow in Qingning have been blowing for ten days and may not stop. My Silk Garment Misplacing Jade Technique is gradually regressing. If Li Xian doesn't return, there will be no one to help me practice."

She decided to summon Li Xian back.

However, the wind and snow were heavy; ordinary guards and servants would get lost leaving the manor and lacked the skill to deliver the summons. Madam Wen thought it over and decided it would be better to go and call him herself.

And so, this scene unfolded.

She floated in a white robe, hands clasped before her abdomen, her demeanor dignified.

Li Xian hurried to greet her, asking, "Madam, how did you come here?"

"What?" Madam Wen retorted coquettishly, "I cannot come?"

"You can, of course you can," Li Xian said.

Madam Wen crossed the threshold and saw that the yard was set with tables and food, with hot soup boiling. She said, "You little brat, always coming up with strange ideas. How can you still be eating outside in such heavy wind and snow? Do you have nowhere else to go?"

The guards looked at each other, put down their bowls and chopsticks in unison, and respectfully called out, "Madam!"

Madam Wen nodded and said, "So this is where you hold court?"

Li Xian supported her by the hand and walked inside, saying as they went, "Yes, that is my study, that is my inner courtyard where I practice martial arts. This side is where they live..." He pointed them out one by one.

Madam Wen said, "Though the sparrow is small, it has all its organs." She walked slowly and gracefully. Luo Xia and the guards stood frozen, their blood suddenly turning cold, eyes lowered, daring only to look at the hem of her skirt.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, in such heavy wind and snow... why... why did you come personally? If there is something, please give your orders."

Madam Wen did not answer but instead asked, "These people, are they your sworn brothers?"

"Yes," Li Xian nodded.

"Sworn brothers?" Madam Wen asked curiously, "Would they really die for you?"

Zhang Hou stepped forward in large strides, saying firmly, "Madam, Zhang would truly be willing to die for the Master."

"Oh?" Madam Wen said, "Really?" As she spoke, her fair hand turned over, condensing a strand of internal energy. She struck lightly.

The internal energy took form, showing five colors. It floated extremely slowly, as if walking step by step. Li Xian said, "Zhang Hou, step back!"

Seeing the colorful energy coming towards him, Zhang Hou swallowed hard, his eyes firm. He stood his ground. Li Xian circulated his energy, intending to knock Zhang Hou away from a distance.

The Madam raised her hand and grabbed his wrist, her fingertips applying a slight force, instantly immobilizing him. Li Xian could not move. Zhang Hou, seeing this, thought, "Since I am prepared to die, I might as well be more heroic. Why make it difficult for Master Li?" He resolutely stepped forward, colliding with the five-colored energy palm.

His whole body shook, and a mist of blood burst forth.

After a moment of silence, Zhang Hou suddenly let out an "Eh?" and asked, "Why am I not dead?"

Madam Wen said, "Why would I kill you? This ball of internal energy expelled the impure blood from your body. It does you more good than harm."

"You can die for Little Xian, that is very good. You must remain this way in the future."

"Unlike someone, who thinks of me as vicious."

She glanced at Li Xian.

Li Xian said, "I am willing to accept punishment, but I do not want Brother Zhang Hou to die for me."

Madam Wen said, "Hmph!" She pushed Li Xian's hand away, her eyes turning slightly cold. She was not very satisfied with Li Xian's performance today. However, his true feelings were revealed, and his nature was on display, which was unavoidable.

"If he had shown no reaction at all, his scheming would be so deep that I would need to be on guard. His performance just now, though not particularly good, only shows that he lacks my guidance. We have plenty of time, and I can teach him slowly," Madam Wen thought to herself. She then slightly raised her hand, allowing Li Xian to support her again.

Li Xian had long known the Madam's unpredictable temper; if she wanted to take someone's life, she would do so without frowning. Having everyone stay here only added danger. He immediately said, "Zhang Hou, Wang Wu, take your men and pack up the stove and pots. Today's banquet ends here. I have matters to discuss with the Madam."

Zhang Hou, Wang Wu, and the other guards felt as if a great burden had been lifted, all thinking, "This Madam is too terrifying!" They quickly packed up the tables and bowls.

Madam Wen raised her hand in a stopping motion, and the crowd paused their actions. She said, "I see this table full of dishes and meat, not yet finished. The charcoal under the stove is burning brightly, so why the rush?"

"Since I am here, and you are all Little Xian's brothers, you may all sit down."

Madam Wen smoothed her skirt and sat down. The guards all took their seats. Li Xian brought bowls and chopsticks, filled a bowl with hot soup, and presented it to the Madam.

Madam Wen said, "This wicked idea was yours, wasn't it? Cooking food in the wind and snow, in all these years, you are the only one I have seen."

"If you were to meet that old heretic, your temperament would be quite compatible with his."

Li Xian guessed, "Madam sought me out specifically, I'm afraid it is to practice the Silk Garment Misplacing Jade Technique." He said, "And what about the Madam?"

Madam Wen smiled without speaking. The atmosphere eased, and everyone drank a few cups of wine, their courage growing stronger.

Madam Wen asked softly, "You are all Little Xian's brothers, come and tell me, does he have a lover in Qingning County? Has he seduced any good women?"

The guards often heard Luo Xia say: "Your Wuxiao Lang, though seemingly glorious, is young yet rules like a king. He is also quite lucky with women. But in reality... this luck is hard to bear. Beauty is a bone-shaving knife, and that one's beauty is a bone-shaving knife with serrated edges."

Only now did they deeply understand. Zhang Hou said, "Madam, Master Li eliminates the violent and supports the good. He is upright and will never seduce good women."

Wang Wu echoed, "Yes, Master Li has many admirers, but he keeps himself clean and pure. He is not close to women in daily life and practices martial arts diligently. We cannot compare to him. Madam can rest assured."

Li Xian sighed: "My training has not been in vain!"

"Oh?" Madam Wen said, "Not close to women? There is a woman here."

She had long noticed Luo Xia, lifted her chin with a finger, examined her face, and suddenly laughed, "What a beautiful face, but why is half of it burned?"

Her tone hid joy, and her heart was slightly relieved.

"Reporting to the Madam, it was injured by a treacherous villain," Luo Xia said respectfully.

Madam Wen said, "Since that is the case, you must assist Little Xian well." She swept her gaze over the crowd and said, "I have important matters, so I will not talk in detail with everyone. You may continue eating and drinking slowly. Little Xian, we are leaving."

Li Xian said, "Yes." He supported the Madam and left. The two disappeared into the wind and snow.

Inside the Wuxiao Hall.

The guards all breathed a sigh of relief, only then realizing that sweat had soaked their clothes. Luo Xia sighed, "The Sword-Breaking Madam... has become even more terrifying."

"I have to say, Li Xian really has some skills. Judging by the situation, the Sword-Breaking Madam and Li Xian have a good relationship. Did he really manage to tame this ruthless beauty of the martial world?"

"This kind of romantic fortune, how are you going to bear it? If you don't handle it well, it could truly be eternal damnation."

Inside the Quiet Heart Pagoda.

Candles were lit on all four sides. Outside the pagoda, the wind was like knives and frost like swords, howling incessantly, but inside was quiet and peaceful.

Madam Wen took off her robe and sat cross-legged adjusting her breath. Her Silk Garment Misplacing Jade Technique had been neglected for over a month, and she felt a sense of urgency. There was also a hidden anticipation.

Madam Wen said, "Little Xian, during this closed-door retreat, you need not leave the pagoda. The wind and snow outside are heavy, and you cannot go out anyway."

"Like this... wouldn't it be disrespectful to the Madam?" Li Xian asked.

"You little brat," Madam Wen said, "Haven't you seen enough already?" She put her hands behind her back and continued, "Help me put on the silk garment!" Her face was slightly flushed.

The silk garment moved over her body, sealing her joints and blocking the acupoints around her body.

Madam Wen's eyes rippled. She thought of how fierce and powerful she was when she was out in the world. But every time she practiced this technique, she inevitably ended up being controlled by others, feeling as if she were being manipulated.

Although her limbs were difficult to move, her internal energy was pure. The Sword-Breaking Madam still had many means at her disposal.

Her thoughts drifted, and desire suddenly arose.

Her heart pounded like a deer, and itched like a cat had scratched it.

Seeing the Madam in his hands, Li Xian relaxed slightly and secretly thought, "If I were a match for you, I would definitely turn the tables now."

The Madam's silk garment was complete, and she could no longer move; her arms and wrists and various joints were all restrained. Li Xian joked, "Madam, you are in my hands now."

"You little brat, what are you going to do?" Madam Wen was not angry at all, her eyes curved, full of shyness and coquettishness.

Li Xian thought about how the Madam's attitude had changed step by step along the way. In Taihang Mountain City, he had shared food and drink with her. He could test the waters slightly and said, "I am going to deal with you properly."

"You little white-eyed wolf, tell me, how are you going to deal with me?" Madam Wen said softly.

Li Xian said, "Madam must promise me that you will let me do as I please and will not blame me in the future."

"You little brat, you've learned to threaten me," Madam Wen's voice was as sweet as honey, and her heart stirred. "I want to see just how bold this boy can be." She said, "Go ahead and try. We are so intimate, as long as it is not the final step, I will not blame you."

Li Xian gently stroked her jade-like neck and said, "If I do this, Madam will not blame me?"

Madam Wen said, "I am a daughter of the martial world, after all. Do you take me for a shy, sheltered young lady?"

Li Xian asked, "What about this?" He lightly brushed her hair.

Madam Wen frowned and said, "With just this much courage, it's really boring. Just do as you please."

Suddenly, she was taken aback, feeling the situation change instantly, the attack becoming fierce. Madam Wen raised an eyebrow and understood: "This boy was playing hard to get, and I fell right into his trap."

Li Xian seized the rare opportunity to boldly discipline the Madam. He skillfully used the Eight Styles of Touching the Clouds; the Madam sometimes cursed, sometimes trembled like a shaking flower branch.

They frolicked for half an hour. The Madam's eyes were like water, ripples rippling through them. She leaned against Li Xian's chest.

Madam Wen's pretty face was flushed, and she said, "Little Xian, I need to practice. You should leave the pagoda now."

Li Xian agreed. He walked out of the pagoda tower, saw the spring-like fragrance in the inner courtyard, and remembered the scene in the pagoda. He sighed:

"The Madam is ruthless, insidious, and cold. Yet she is also a woman."

"Only when one's strength truly surpasses the Madam's can one make her reveal her feminine side."

Li Xian washed the fragrance from his hands, suppressed the restlessness in his heart, and continued to practice martial arts, striving for improvement.

Madam Wen closed her eyes and practiced internally, her power gradually advancing. Not long after, she opened her eyes. The blush on her cheeks had not yet faded, and a new flush arose. She remembered the scene just now; when had she ever been manipulated like this before?

The prestigious Sword-Breaking Madam, if someone were to provoke or humiliate her, she would surely kill them without hesitation. But at this moment, she was not angry.

Instead, she felt shy, angry, and happy. The feeling was very strange. She cursed coquettishly, "The true master does not reveal his abilities. This boy's courage has grown, and he has become truly lawless."

"It wouldn't be necessary to be so obedient, otherwise it would be quite boring."

"I will indulge you a few times. Once I have the Heart Gu in my hands, I will teach you a lesson slowly."
