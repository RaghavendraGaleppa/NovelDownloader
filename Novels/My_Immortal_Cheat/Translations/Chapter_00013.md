# Chapter 13: Battle Commences

Zhou Tian's eldest and second brothers were constantly away fighting wars. In the original owner's scattered memories, he had only met them a few times, knowing only that they were two peerless prodigies, figures at the very top of the pyramid in their era.

Zhou Tian nodded and said, "So that's how it is. In that case, I'll be looking forward to seeing Third Brother display his prowess!"

Zhou Xunchuan shook his head and said, "Don't count on me to display much prowess. We're a bit different from others. The Youth Grand Competition is divided into the Common Tournament and the Elite Tournament. Only the top hundred from the Common Tournament qualify for the Elite Tournament, but we directly enter the Elite Tournament. Prodigies from all states will arrive then. At that time, it will be up to Gu Zhen and the others..."

Zhou Tian chuckled, "Third Brother, don't be so modest. If even you aren't capable, what will Gu Zhen and the others think..."

There were quite a number of young people in their generation, not just imperial descendants, but also children of influential figures in the imperial capital. Coupled with the fact that they were all descendants of powerful cultivators, the training and resources they received were top-tier, producing many true geniuses.

Gu Zhen, the son of General Gu Feng, who guarded the frontiers, was one of the outstanding ones. From a young age, he received military-style training from his father. His iron-blooded battle aura had truly inherited his father's essence, and not long ago, he had condensed his Dharma Idol True Body, possessing immense strength.

This was just one of them. Similar to him was Li Xuanyi, the son of the Imperial Guard Commander. He too was already in the Dharma Idol realm. When he condensed his Dharma Idol, saber qi split the sky, drawing the chime of sabers from half the city, startling the entire imperial capital.

Prime Minister Liu's daughter, Liu Yan, was worth mentioning. She possessed a special physique: the Wind Flame Body. At her birth, winds roared for three thousand miles and flames blazed across half the sky. It was said that even Emperor Qin was startled by the phenomenon.

Zhou Zui, the son of the Carefree King. The Carefree King was Emperor Qin's younger brother, but unlike the Emperor, he wasn't a full-blood sibling. He had been a dissolute individual in his youth. After Emperor Qin ascended the throne, he was granted the title of Carefree King. His son was just like him, spending his days messing around in the imperial capital, yet his strength was formidable. He had clashed with the aforementioned individuals several times, usually resulting in an even match, leading some to speculate that he had never used his full power. It's worth noting that his relationship with Zhou Tian was quite good; the two often frequented the pleasure quarters of the imperial capital together.

There should have been a few others, but Zhou Tian couldn't find them in the original owner's scattered memories, likely lost.

And the one before him was also far from simple. His talk of "not being capable" could only be taken as a joke. Just a few days before Zhou Tian's transmigration, dragon roars shook heaven and earth within the imperial palace, a phenomenon similar to when the previous few princes condensed their Dharma Idols.

Zhou Xunchuan smiled faintly, offering no further explanation, and changed the subject.

The two chatted for a while longer, with Tian Ling quietly listening beside them. Half an hour quickly passed...

Zi Yuan, who was nearby, stepped forward and whispered, "Your Highnesses, the eighty-win streak level battle is about to begin."

Zhou Tian looked at Zhou Xunchuan, whose backside seemed glued to the sofa, and tentatively asked, "Third Brother, why don't you stay and watch with us?"

"Haha, since Brother Tian has spoken, then I shall stay!" Zhou Xunchuan burst into laughter, leaning brazenly back into the sofa.

Zhou Tian wore a helpless expression. *Even if I didn't say anything, you'd still stay here, wouldn't you?* He turned his head to look at Tian Ling. He had originally wanted to cuddle with his little Ling'er while watching, just like watching a movie in his previous life, but now he could only give up on the idea.

Zhou Xunchuan clearly saw through his intentions. This Third Prince was full of mischievous humor and had to mess with his plans.

Tian Ling saw Zhou Tian looking at him with a helpless expression, and looked back confusedly. "Meow meow meow? Why are you looking at me?"

Zi Yuan reactivated the projection array, and the scene of the arena reappeared on the wall.

Unlike the previous sixty-win streak level battle, this fight's venue was much grander. It was no longer a conventional arena, but an independent space, densely forested with babbling rivers and a small grassy mound. Upon reaching eighty wins, cultivators were basically all at the Dharma Idol level. The scope of their battles was immense, and ordinary arenas could no longer support their fights. Such independent spaces were constructed using powerful spatial arrays combined with the power of creation.

Within that independent space, two figures already stood in the void. Saying two figures wasn't entirely accurate, as only one was human. The other was a humanoid creature with snowy white wings—not fleshy wings, but covered in feathers about the length of a palm. It was approximately three meters tall, appeared very neutral, making it hard to distinguish its gender, had sky-blue eyes, and wore bright silver armor covered in runic marks.

Opposite it was a young man dressed in linen clothes. He had no particularly striking features, save for his exceptionally bright eyes, which revealed great resolve.

"A member of the Celestial Race!" Zhou Tian said with some surprise. The humanoid creature with white wings was clearly a Celestial, a race from Futian State. Their wings were their distinguishing mark. During the ancient chaotic era, every pair of their wings was sold at exorbitant prices, almost leading to their extinction at one point. After disappearing for a long time, they slowly recovered their racial strength and began to re-emerge after several major powers divided the world and established order in recent antiquity. They naturally commanded the power of wind and possessed extreme affinity for space. Almost every adult Celestial was a master of space.

He turned his head and asked Zhou Xunchuan, "Third Brother, he isn't the one you're favoring, is he?"

Zhou Xunchuan shook his head and replied, "Not him. After all, he isn't from our human race; I have a mental block about nurturing him. It's the one opposite him."

Zhou Tian nodded, refocusing on the scene. Both were veterans of the arena. After a voice in the void announced "Begin," neither spoke much, immediately starting their fight.

The Celestial's wings behind him trembled slightly, stirring up a whirlwind that uprooted trees. His body vanished into the void.

The person opposite him showed no panic. Golden light flashed in his eyes. His left leg vibrated, tearing through space as it swept backward.

Clang! With a metallic clang, the left leg, capable of tearing space, halted before the Celestial's armguard. All the runic marks on the Celestial's body lit up, and a repulsive force flung the man away.

Whoosh! Whoosh! The wings trembled again, and streaks of white feathers shot forth. Black fissures appeared in space the instant they passed through, a phenomenon of space being torn apart.

The man who had been flung back turned a metallic black all over. The sharp feathers fell powerlessly upon contact. This was his divine ability, capable of strengthening his physical body. Seeing this, the Celestial's blue eyes flashed with a cold light. The wings behind him lit up with divine radiance, and runes surged forth. A massive phantom wing appeared behind him. As his actual wings trembled slightly, the giant phantom wing in the air also quivered, emitting endless white radiant light that dyed the heavens and earth white, tearing apart the void.
