# Chapter 61: Hidden Cave Behind the Waterfall, Spirit Apes Stealing Ore  

Gu Yuan was no stranger to encountering situations where "opportunity lay before him, yet the path forward was unclear."  

But the Stone Liquid's guidance was of an exceptionally high level and never wrong. The only explanation was that this waterfall concealed some mystery.  

**"Boom! Rumble!"**  

The waterfall's torrent was ferocious, cascading down from the cliff's peak with such force that it obscured all vision.  

With such violent currents, it seemed impossible for any path to exist ahead.  

Yet, recalling the adventure tales he had read in his past life, Gu Yuan couldn't help but smile nostalgically.  

**"Go!"**  

With a wave of his hand, he infused a cyan paper crane with his magic, sending it fluttering toward the waterfall with all its might.  

Behind the watery curtain, there must be another world.  

**"Screech! Screech!"**  

Just as the paper crane was about to pass through the waterfall into the hidden space beyond, sharp monkey cries suddenly erupted from the ancient trees on either side of the valley.  

**"Whoosh!"**  

A small fruit pit, propelled by tremendous force, shot toward the paper crane, attempting to knock it down.  

Instead of being alarmed, Gu Yuan was delighted. Within his dantian, the Minor Giant Spirit Seal and the Black Tortoise Seal both flared to life. A massive black-and-gold tortoise phantom emerged from the surging waters, lifting the paper crane onto its back.  

**"Clang! Clang! Clang!"**  

The monkeys' shrieks grew increasingly frantic as fruit pits rained down like hailstones, trying to strike the paper crane.  

But with the Minor Giant Spirit Seal empowering it, the Black Tortoise Seal was no longer what it once was. Its shell bore deep, ancient patterns and effortlessly blocked every attack.  

Under the tortoise's protection, the paper crane finally broke through the roaring waterfall and entered a new realm.  

**"So it truly is a hidden cave behind the waterfall—another path indeed!"**  

Through the paper crane's faint perception, Gu Yuan glimpsed the scene beyond the waterfall.  

A massive cavern lay concealed behind the torrent, completely hidden from view unless one dared to pass through the waterfall.  

Inside the cavern, a troop of tawny-furred monkeys carried crude stone tools, tirelessly chiseling at the cave walls. From the rock, they extracted jade-like stones.  

Dust filled the air, and the constant clanging of tools made the cavern resemble a bustling construction site.  

Yet, the thunderous roar of the waterfall drowned out all other noise.  

At the cave's entrance, two large silver-backed monkeys clutched a gourd, drooling as they snored loudly.  

**"Screech! Screech!"**  

Suddenly, one of the monkeys spotted the paper crane and let out a panicked cry.  

Another monkey, in its fright, hurled a stone hammer straight at one of the sleeping silver-backed apes.  

---  

**"Roar!"**  

The silver-backed ape jolted awake, furious. It glared in the direction the hammer had come from, but the tawny monkeys all pointed frantically at the paper crane floating in the air.  

**"Hmm?"**  

The silver-backed ape froze, then panicked. It snatched up a silver stone rod and hurled it at the paper crane with all its might.  

The attack was devastating, slicing through the air with the force of tens of thousands of pounds.  

**"Groan!"**  

But the Black Tortoise Seal beneath the paper crane seemed to come alive, emitting an eerie cry. Its dark, ancient shell easily absorbed the blow.  

**"Screech! Screech!"**  

The silver-backed ape flailed in desperation, quickly rousing its companion. Together, they channeled their demonic energy into the stone rods and launched another frenzied assault.  

**"A hidden cave behind the waterfall, and spirit apes stealing ore—how fascinating!"**  

Just then, a tall figure astride a jade-scaled dragon burst through the waterfall.  

Before he even arrived, an icy aura spread through the cavern. Two thick blue chains, like serpents, coiled around the silver-backed apes, binding them tightly.  

These apes were only mid-tier spirit beasts, equivalent to Qi Refinement Layer Six cultivators—no match for Gu Yuan in his current state.  

In the blink of an eye, the Ice Shackle Seal rendered both apes immobile, their limbs frozen stiff by the chilling energy. Their eyes widened in terror as they stared at Gu Yuan.  

**"Screech! Screech!"**  

Seeing their leaders subdued in an instant, the tawny monkeys in the cave's depths froze, their faces filled with fear.  

**"Thud! Thud! Thud!"**  

Without waiting for Gu Yuan to speak, the monkeys dropped their tools, scurried forward, and knelt before him, clasping their hands in desperate supplication.  

Some even tried to massage his back and shoulders, acting like eager servants.  

Gu Yuan found this amusing but ignored them, turning his attention instead to a pile of jade-like stones in the cavern.  

A rich spiritual energy emanated from the pile, making even the crude cave seem radiant.  

This was the opportunity foretold by the Stone Liquid.  

The pile consisted of freshly mined spirit stones!  

A quick estimate suggested nearly a thousand of them.  

And from the depths of the cave, even more spiritual energy flowed—proof that the vein had yet to be fully excavated.  

**"A hidden micro spirit stone vein—how extraordinary!"**  

Gu Yuan couldn't help but marvel at the sight.  

He had imagined many possibilities for the opportunity on Spirit Crane Island, but never had he expected to find a spirit stone vein.  

---  

Locating a spirit stone vein was a highly specialized task. The Azure Peak Dao Academy had an entire division, the Mountain-Shifting Hall, dedicated to prospecting and mining such veins.  

Every year, the academy invested vast resources into this endeavor.  

Veins were buried deep underground, making them incredibly difficult to detect. Only specialized artifacts and techniques could uncover them beneath the earth's vast layers.  

Among them, the hardest to find were large veins and micro veins.  

Large veins formed only in the deepest reaches where spiritual energy was most abundant, hidden so well that only those with immense power could discover them.  

Micro veins, on the other hand, were simply too small—containing at most ten thousand spirit stones, sometimes as few as a few thousand. Their energy fluctuations were so faint that they couldn't even trigger detection artifacts, like fireflies drowned out by the moon's glow.  

Of course, a true master prospector could still find a micro vein, but such experts wouldn't waste their time scouring mountains and rivers for such meager gains.  

To put it bluntly, the average noble family's treasury emitted more spiritual energy than a micro vein.  

Yet, judging by the spiritual energy here, this was undoubtedly a micro vein.  

Still, even a micro vein meant at least a thousand spirit stones—a staggering windfall for an individual like Gu Yuan.  

Throughout history, many rogue cultivators and minor clans had risen to prominence after stumbling upon a micro vein.  

**"Whoosh!"**  

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan flicked his sleeve, summoning his magic to gather the already-mined spirit stones into his possession.  

**"Roar!"**  

But just then, an enraged bellow echoed from behind him as a massive figure lunged at his back.
