# Chapter 25: Annihilating the Enemy in One Strike  

The one who set the mountain ablaze was naturally Wei Qian.  

He had carefully calculated the wind direction and chosen the perfect spot. With a few large fireballs, the flames immediately erupted into a roaring inferno.  

If the three Sang brothers ignored it, the fire would undoubtedly reach their residence in no time. Wei Qian had learned from his conversation with Bai Fugui that there were no mortals living on Black Wind Ridge, which justified his actions.  

As for how many animals and birds perished in the flames—that was beyond Wei Qian's control. After all, he was born human.  

"Now, the Sang brothers should be rushing here soon," Wei Qian mused, calculating how many of them would come.  

His guess was two.  

There were two reasons: First, with the enemy situation unclear, sending just one wouldn't be safe. Second, someone had to stay behind to guard Lu Ping.  

Of course, this was just his speculation—he couldn't be entirely sure. But when he spotted two figures hurrying toward him in the distance, a faint smile curled on his lips.  

He had guessed right!  

Wei Qian continued to lie in wait, biding his time until the Sang brothers drew closer.  

At this moment, he couldn't help but think that if he had mastered a concealment technique, his ambush would be even more effective.  

But for now, he had to strike from a distance.  

A streak of dark light shot out from the forest, aiming straight for the eldest Sang brother, who was at the sixth level of Qi Refining.  

"Hmph, bring it on!" The eldest Sang brother was prepared. With a pat to his storage pouch, he summoned a tortoise-shell-shaped defensive artifact, positioning it in front of him.  

*Bang!*  

The dark light collided with the tortoise-shell artifact, instantly halting and revealing its true form—a nail-shaped weapon!  

"A low-grade first-tier artifact? Hah!" The eldest Sang brother laughed, his tense mood easing slightly.  

He had feared a sudden, deadly strike—until his thoughts were abruptly cut short.  

His entire body stiffened before suddenly relaxing again.  

That fleeting glint of cold light had merely grazed past him, leaving only a minor wound.  

Though he didn't understand the attacker's intent, the eldest Sang brother immediately pushed the tortoise-shell artifact forward—only to then collapse straight to the ground!  

"Big brother!" The second Sang brother was horrified by the sudden turn of events.  

His eldest brother, a sixth-level Qi Refining cultivator, had been killed in an instant?  

A chill ran down his spine. He summoned a flying trident to circle around him for protection, then turned and fled without hesitation.  

*Forget avenging big brother! I need to get back and warn third brother—we have to escape together!*  

The enemy they faced was far too powerful!  

At this moment, he had no time to ponder how his brother had died. From his perspective, the enemy had launched a single attack, and his brother had fallen without any chance to resist.  

If Wei Qian could hear his thoughts, he would have replied, *"Of course there was no resistance."*  

After all, this was a weapon poisoned with venom from what was likely a second-tier serpent demon, further enhanced by a hundred days of wish-granting power—enough to kill an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator in one strike.  

In the entire history of Yunzhou, no artifact of this caliber had ever existed!  

In the world of cultivation, artifacts were ranked as follows: Artifacts, Spiritual Artifacts, Magic Treasures, Divine Treasures, and Heaven-Connecting Divine Treasures.  

Though Wei Qian didn’t know the exact rank of the *Wish-Dragon Pearl*, given its ability to alter spiritual root aptitude—a power that touched upon the laws of the world—it had to be at least on par with a Heaven-Connecting Divine Treasure.  

Whether the eldest Sang brother was fortunate or unfortunate to die by such an attack was hard to say.  

As for why Wei Qian had used the *Frostlight Needle*—his plan was to end the battle decisively.  

After killing the strongest of the three, he immediately directed the *Frostlight Needle* to pursue the second brother while he himself gave chase.  

Having mastered the *Thousand Tribulations Body-Tempering Technique*, his physical prowess far surpassed that of ordinary Qi Refining cultivators.  

At the same fifth level of Qi Refining, Wei Qian sprinted like a whirlwind, closing the distance in an instant.  

*"What?! How is this possible?!"* The second brother’s heart sank. *When did we three brothers provoke such a formidable enemy?*  

Suddenly, he remembered that among the stack of talismans he had received, there was a *Swift Movement Talisman*. Frantically, he rummaged through them and finally found it at the very bottom.  

*"Perfect! With this, I can outrun him!"* Without hesitation, he slapped the talisman onto himself.  

At the same time, he saw Wei Qian fling out a talisman of his own.  

The surge of energy from a high-grade first-tier talisman rippled outward, prompting the second brother to immediately activate a *Golden Light Talisman*—another high-grade first-tier defensive talisman—on himself.  

This talisman enveloped the user in a protective golden barrier, capable of withstanding at least one powerful attack.  

But when he saw the watery shield forming in front of him, he froze.  

Wei Qian had actually used a *Water Barrier Talisman*—a defensive talisman!  

*What kind of strategy is this?!* The second brother’s mind reeled in confusion.  

Then he saw the *Frostlight Needle* hovering ominously outside the barrier, its needle tip aimed directly at him—and he understood everything.  

*This was the weapon that killed my brother in an instant!*  

His face turned ashen.  

"Who the hell are you?!" he howled. "We have no grudge against you!"  

He mentally reviewed every possible enemy he could recall but concluded that Wei Qian was simply an unknown assailant who had appeared out of nowhere.  

Wei Qian snorted. "Since when do you need a grudge to act?"  

"I recall that Lu Ping, the talisman master, had no quarrel with you either."  

"You—you’re working for that brat Lu Ping? Impossible! I watched him for three months—he had no close allies!" the second brother exclaimed in disbelief.  

Wei Qian said nothing more. Instead, he calmly calculated how long it would take for the water barrier to dissipate. The moment it did, he would activate the *Frostlight Needle* and finish off the second brother.  

To hasten the barrier's collapse, Wei Qian multitasked, controlling the nail-shaped artifact to repeatedly strike the water shield.  

Realizing his inevitable fate, the second brother grew desperate.  

He sat cross-legged, pulling out every offensive talisman he had and channeling his spiritual energy into them.  

The moment the barrier fell, he would unleash them all in a final suicidal attack!  

Seeing this, Wei Qian smiled faintly. He had anticipated such a move.  

He slowly retreated while retrieving two more talismans—another high-grade *Water Barrier Talisman* and the mid-grade second-tier offensive talisman he had prepared earlier.  

Once the enemy's barrier weakened, he would shield himself and strike the killing blow.  

The second brother’s heart sank into utter despair.  

This enemy was the most cautious, most terrifying cultivator he had ever encountered in his life.  

"Who *are* you?!" he bellowed furiously.  

"Just a passing cultivator," Wei Qian replied coldly.  

As the water barrier flickered and faded, Wei Qian—standing eighty paces away—activated his own *Water Barrier Talisman* and, without hesitation, sent the *Frostlight Needle* piercing forward!
