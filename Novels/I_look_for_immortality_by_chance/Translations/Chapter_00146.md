# Chapter 146: The Four Realms Mirror, The Great Demon's Scheme!

The three figures exuded profound auras. Two of them had ape heads and human bodies, with emerald hair and golden eyes—clearly Great Demons of the Emerald Flame Golden-Eyed Ape clan. Beside them stood a silver-haired youth with antlers atop his head, his expression sinister, his true form unknown.

At this moment, the eldest of the three, a mid-stage Great Demon of the Emerald Flame Golden-Eyed Ape clan, sighed and asked, "What should we do?"

Hearing this, the other ape demon shook his head repeatedly, his expression grim.

"There are only two paths left—why hesitate?" The silver-haired, antlered demon sneered.

"What two paths?" the other ape demon asked.

"Fight or flee!"

"Though the Azure Peak Dao Academy has deep foundations, they suffered a great calamity not long ago. The number of Golden Core cultivators they can mobilize now is no more than a handful. If the three of us join forces with a few rogue cultivators, we might stand a chance. But the Azure Peak Dao Academy is, after all, a legacy of the Celestial Palace's immortal disciples. Even if we win, we can't storm Azure Peak Mountain and slay their Golden Cores." As he spoke, the antlered demon couldn't help but shake his head.

In the past, when his father was still here, the Azure Peak Dao Academy wouldn’t have dared to invade the Scarlet Moon Great River. But with the upheaval in the East Sea, his father had no choice but to rush there, leaving the Scarlet Moon Great River without its pillar of strength, unable to resist the might of the Dao Academy.

"And if we flee?" the ape demon asked again.

"Fleeing is simple. As Great Demons, where in the world can't we go? The East Sea, the Northern Plains—countless spirit islands await. Just pick a cave and cultivate there," the antlered demon replied with a laugh.

"But what about our kin?" the elder ape demon sighed.

The antlered youth before them was the offspring of a former patron of the Scarlet Moon Great River—a dragon king and a female cultivator. The woman had long since perished, and the dragon had returned to the East Sea, leaving the youth alone and unburdened. His words came easily, but the Emerald Flame Golden-Eyed Ape clan had a vast lineage—how could they abandon it all? Even if they found a spirit island to cultivate, how could they sustain their entire clan? Could they really leave them all behind?

"Staying here is just waiting for death—the fate of the Violet Gold Six-Winged Eagle clan is proof enough!"

"As long as you survive, the Emerald Flame Golden-Eyed Ape clan can rise again. Besides, with our strength, we can easily take a hundred kin with us in secret—enough to start anew!" The antlered demon had clearly thought this through, speaking without hesitation.

The two ape demons exchanged glances and fell silent.

The antlered demon sneered but didn’t press them. He knew they would make the right choice.

What had the Violet Gold Six-Winged Eagle clan gained after years of fighting the Sunset Sect? Countless dead kin, lost spirit peaks, and even helping the Sunset Sect nurture a Golden Core cultivator in the process—a truly tragic outcome.

Without supreme combat power, all resistance was just slow suicide. The sooner they left, the more of their foundation they could preserve.

"The Celestial Palace is mighty, and the Dao Academy is rampant. We cannot face them head-on. Leaving this troubled land might be the best choice..." the elder ape sighed.

"Exactly. As long as we survive, opportunities will come."

"The situation in the Celestial Palace is beyond our reach, but I once heard my father say that the one up there is nearing their limit. The death of the True Dragon was far from simple..." the antlered demon whispered.

These words struck like a hammer, solidifying the two demons' resolve to leave. Yet a knot of resentment lingered in their hearts, stifling their thoughts.

"If we leave, we must teach the Azure Peak Dao Academy a lesson first. Otherwise, they’ll think we’re made of clay!" the elder ape demon said coldly, looking upward.

"If we leave, it must be in silence. Any commotion could bring complications," the antlered demon frowned.

The Azure Peak Dao Academy was not to be trifled with. If they caused trouble, none of them would escape.

"Don’t worry. My method is subtle—it doesn’t target Golden Cores. By the time they react, we’ll be long gone. No matter how furious they are, they won’t be able to touch us!" The demon laughed coldly and produced a shimmering silver fan inscribed with countless tadpole-like runes. As soon as it appeared, the entire underwater palace trembled, as if space itself were shaking.

"Is this... a Void-Piercing treasure?" the antlered demon's eyes narrowed.

"Correct. This treasure is called the 'Four Realms Fan.' It can tear through space and open passages to other realms. However, the destinations are random, and it can only transport those below Golden Core. There’s even a risk of perishing in the spatial turbulence." The demon waved the fan lightly, a sinister smile on his face.

"Brother Ape, you intend to..." The antlered demon raised an eyebrow, a playful grin forming as he guessed the plan.

"The Azure Peak Dao Academy uses our Scarlet Moon Great River to temper their disciples, doesn’t they? Then I’ll give them exactly what they want!"

"With their elders protecting them, their peers supporting them, and their spirit ships nearby—how is that tempering?"

"I’ll help them by sending them to the four great domains for a real trial!" The demon laughed coldly, then took out a set of strange formation banners. He planted them into the map of the river’s veins within the palace and channeled his demonic power. The Four Realms Fan erupted with silver light, countless fan shadows scattering into the banners and flowing endlessly along the water veins.

On the banners, over a dozen blood-red dots appeared—some stationary, others moving rapidly, as if on the attack. But no matter how they shifted, as long as they remained in the great river, they couldn’t escape the detection of the banners and the fan.

"Killing my kin—did they think there’d be no price to pay?" The elder ape’s face twisted with fury.

Deep in the Scarlet Moon Great River, Gu Yuan remained unaware of the demons’ machinations.

At this moment, he sat cross-legged in his cave abode, wholly focused on refining the "Jade Roaming Heaven-Soaring Seal."

Within his dantian, vast spiritual energy surged continuously into the emerald-green seal. The hidden Dao patterns and inscriptions on the seal gradually revealed themselves under the nourishment of his energy, exuding an arcane aura.

"Whoosh!"

Suddenly, Gu Yuan’s entire body dissolved into a pool of water. Simultaneously, a figure materialized from a shallow puddle a hundred zhang away.

"Whoosh!"

But in the next instant, the figure vanished again, reappearing another hundred zhang further.

Within moments, his form had traversed several li, his movements mystical and unpredictable.

"As expected of a Golden Core treasure’s water遁 technique. Within a hundred zhang, wherever there’s water, I can shift instantly. Even late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators would be helpless against this." Gu Yuan flickered once more, returning to his cave abode, his eyes alight with satisfaction.

Just then, a faint breeze stirred within the cave.
