# Chapter 83: Mobilizing the Immortal Sect to Hunt Li Zhengjing! [Seeking Subscriptions! Seeking Monthly Tickets!]

The battle at the Xuannan Spirit Mine erupted suddenly!

The mine trembled violently, on the verge of collapse, yet the chaos subsided within thirty breaths.

"Pathetic," Li Zhengjing looked down at Chen Yang beneath his feet, severing his arm with a single slash. "Three Qi Refinement experts and thirty-six inner disciples think they can bury me here? Even if Chen Zhu himself came, it wouldn't be enough!"

"Impossible!" Chen Yang's face was pale with terror.

Not long ago, Li Zhengjing had been an outer disciple, someone he could manipulate at will—even the late and useless Chen Youyu had easily suppressed him. When Li Zhengjing had just reached Internal Qi, Chen Yang had considered secretly eliminating him outside the sect.

Yet in just two months, how had this youth reached such heights?

In Chen Yang's mind, Li Zhengjing had been an ant—how had he suddenly become an insurmountable giant?

Three inner sect elders from the Chen family had been defeated, and none of the thirty-six inner disciples could withstand his might.

"I knew back then you'd become a great threat to the Chen clan, but I never imagined your growth would be this terrifying..." Chen Yang's voice was bitter. "Had I known, I would have thrown everything at you, even if it meant punishment from the sect and my own death, just to bury you in the outer sect!"

"Too late for regrets," Li Zhengjing replied calmly, thinking to himself, *Luckily, I foresaw these 'had I known' scenarios and avoided disaster after disaster.*

He had killed thirty-five inner disciples but spared Chen Yang. Of the three inner sect elders, he left one alive.

With stolen goods as evidence and two suspects in hand, the case was settled! Returning to the sect to report this would earn him great merit and immense prestige.

Moreover, having broken through to the Qi Refinement realm in such a short time, he would undoubtedly be promoted to a true disciple. With this achievement, he would shake the entire Feather Immortal Sect!

"Your return will create a stir second only to Lu Huaiyuan!" Yuan Zhengfeng remarked. "But I suspect it still won't be enough. The Peak Master likely has another spectacle planned for you."

"We'll discuss that after returning. This time, I need to uncover the truth about that counterfeit medicine peddler."

As he spoke, Li Zhengjing had the Five Elements Creation Tree bind Chen Yang and the elder, stuffing them into the phoenix wood box.

"Someone's coming!" Yuan Zhengfeng suddenly warned.

Li Zhengjing hesitated, then turned to leave via the hidden path he had taken earlier. But halfway through, he found the path collapsed.

"Did the earlier battle cause this?"

He prepared to blast through with the Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi, but the approaching auras grew clearer—multiple Qi Refinement experts were closing in.

"Hostile intent? More from the Chen family?"

"If they were prepared, they wouldn't have arrived so late. Likely other mine overseers."

"That shouldn't be a problem."

Li Zhengjing hung the gold-edged silver token at his side. With the path blocked, he had no choice but to turn back and face them.

Two Qi Refinement cultivators approached—one an elderly man with over three hundred opened acupoints, the other a young man with around a hundred.

"Who dares attack the Spirit Mine?" the elder demanded coldly.

"Li Zhengjing of the Ancient Moon Peak, here on orders to inspect the mine!" Li Zhengjing raised his token. "I've confirmed illegal mining and collusion with outsiders. Evidence and witnesses are secured. Seal the mine—I'll report to the sect!"

"Li Zhengjing?" The young man frowned, pulling out a document. "The Enforcement Hall intercepted a message. During an inspection of inner sect residences, a discarded medicine cauldron was found in your courtyard, embedded with spirit stones of unknown origin. As of noon today, your inspection authority has been revoked. Return to the sect for questioning."

"What?" Li Zhengjing's grip on his token tightened.

"Additionally, Elder Chen Zhu reported anomalies at the mine and sent reinforcements. The earlier battle—did you kill them all?" The young man drew his sword. "Using your authority to silence witnesses?"

"Nonsense!" Li Zhengjing raised his token, but before he could speak, two golden lights flashed—the true disciple and the elder activated their golden tokens to suppress him.

"Li Zhengjing, surrender!" the elder barked. "If you're innocent, the Enforcement Hall will clear you!"

"Stubborn resistance proves guilt!" The young disciple's sword erupted in flames—he practiced the sect's supreme technique, *Heavenly Flame Immolation Art*.

"Fine!" Li Zhengjing activated the *Gentle Breeze Shadow Step*, channeling Qi into his blade. Lightning crackled as he slashed, infused with sword intent.

With a sharp exhale, he unleashed the *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi*, piercing through all obstacles!

Facing two opponents, he dominated the fight.

"Are they colluding with the Chens, trying to trick you into surrendering so they can kill you?" the Hanging Bird piped up from the box. "Tree, wake those two Chen idiots—torture them for answers!"

"Something's wrong!" Yuan Zhengfeng's voice was urgent. "This might be the second spectacle! Maybe... we were wrong from the start."

"Dead wrong!" Li Zhengjing growled from outside the box. "This isn't about building my reputation—it's about forcing me to defect and be hunted! That old bastard didn't warn me—utterly insane!"

Despite having broken through to Qi Refinement less than a day ago, Li Zhengjing's *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi*, left arm's *Blazing Fire Divine Ability*, and the *Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber* allowed him to overpower the two experts.

A single *Blazing Fire Sword*—flames infused with sword intent—sent the elder crashing into the rock wall. Another slash sent the true disciple reeling.

"You got me!" The disciple grinned as flames engulfed Li Zhengjing's face.

"Like hell!" Li Zhengjing lunged forward, his burns healing visibly as he swung his saber, lightning erupting from the blade.

The disciple countered with a three-foot wall of fire, but the lightning, imbued with sword intent, shattered it and sent him flying.

Just as Li Zhengjing prepared to finish him—

"Master!" The Hanging Bird cried out. "Spare him!"

Li Zhengjing paused, then turned and fled using *Gentle Breeze Shadow Step*, cutting down any disciples in his path.

Inside the mine, silence reigned.

After a long pause, a weak voice rasped, "Lin Chi... why did that bird tell him to spare you?"

"I don't know," Lin Chi lay amidst rubble, too injured to move. Without the bird's intervention, he'd be dead.

*Why save me?* He thought of White Firmament and the bird cast into the Thunder Prison.

"White Hanging? Wasn't it thrown into the Thunder Prison, near death?"

"But White Hanging was a white luan bird. That one was golden with green horns—bigger, with a sharper beak. And its voice... too gentle to be that idiot."

Lin Chi was baffled. *Was it the parent of the seven chicks? Guilt-ridden over White Hanging, so it spared me?*

The elder was barely alive. "He came to silence us. Why didn't he finish us? He reached Qi Refinement in two months—how is he this strong? Decades of my cultivation, crushed in moments..."

"Strange. We must report this to the sect."

Lin Chi gasped. "But I'm too injured to move. We need help. It's unnatural... Li Zhengjing's progress defies reason. He must have stolen countless spirit stones and treasures to advance this fast."

The elder agreed weakly. "Even Lu Huaiyuan, nurtured by the sect, never grew this quickly. You're right."

Silence fell again.

Much later, Lin Chi whispered, "This path isn't on the mine's maps. Others won't find us. Will anyone come?"

No answer came.

"Elder Ling... are you dead?" Lin Chi asked mournfully.

"Almost," came the faint reply.

——

Outside the mine, Li Zhengjing ran until he was breathless.

"Why spare him?" he asked the Hanging Bird.

"Master, that's Lin Chi. He trained under my grandfather," the bird said solemnly. "I replaced him as the tree's guardian. He was likely exiled here because of my drunken fire incident."

"So we owe him." Li Zhengjing nodded. "Kill the two Chens in the box and dump them."

"No witnesses?" the bird asked.

"Pointless now," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "This wasn't about the case—it's about defecting."

"Whether we're cleared later depends on the Ancient Moon Peak Master's whims. If he betrays us, we're fugitives forever. If not, he'll restore our names and credit us with exposing the Chens."

Yuan Zhengfeng sighed. "This might be his backup plan. Facing *that* person... even he might not survive unscathed. If he's gravely injured..."

Li Zhengjing said coldly, "In the past, I'd have killed him too."

"But if you don't want to be a fugitive forever, he *must* return alive to clear your name," Yuan Zhengfeng countered.

Li Zhengjing exhaled. "First, we survive this. Then we worry about the rest."

He checked the golden page's divination—no changes.

"What now?" the Hanging Bird asked.

"Leave the Feather Immortal Sect," Li Zhengjing said. "If we don't escape, we're just discarded pawns."

"True. His original plan to deal with the creditor was repurposed for you. If you fail, he'll revert to it," Yuan Zhengfeng said.

"Move!" Li Zhengjing urged. "The sect knows by now."

As he fled, news had indeed reached the sect.

Three elders' seals had shattered, thirty-six inner disciples were missing, and the mine's overseers were leaderless. Silver tokens soared into the sky, signaling the sect.

The Ancient Moon Peak Master was summoned to the main peak's grand hall.

Meanwhile, atop Ancient Moon Peak, Ghost Valley Spirit Official gazed toward the mine and sighed.

Having lived incognito near the sect for over a decade, he understood its workings.

"Three elders, over a hundred inner disciples, and three hundred outer disciples guard the mine. For most, it's impregnable, but for peak Qi Refinement or even Human Immortals, it's nothing."

"Yet who would dare attack within the sect's territory? Even a Human Immortal would struggle to escape."

A bell tolled from the main peak—a full-scale mobilization to hunt Li Zhengjing!

Within the sect's six-thousand-li domain, every official was a sect member. Countless elders and disciples roamed the land.

"Such force... aren't they afraid of crushing him?" Ghost Valley mused. "The Ancient Moon Peak Master's methods are too heavy-handed."

His gaze fell on Chen Zhu's courtyard below, where the Enforcement Hall's chief stood.

"It's done. Starting tomorrow, focus on comprehending the *Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed*. Reach Human Immortality soon," the chief said. "As a guardian elder, you're the pillar of Ancient Moon Peak and the Chen clan's role model. Don't abuse power to shield your kin. This spirit stone case doesn't involve you—otherwise, the Peak Master wouldn't have spared you."

"The Chen clan's backbone is broken. It'll take decades to recover. Is the Peak Master satisfied now?" Chen Zhu sighed. "I thought you were using Chen lives to temper him. But now... you're pushing him to his death?"

Even he, with his strength, couldn't escape the sect's territory after attacking the mine. Yet this youth, in less than a year, slaughtered Chen elites and escaped?

"A genius surpassing even Lu Huaiyuan—why force him into a corner? If the Chens had such talent, I'd sacrifice myself to protect him..."

——

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing had only fled three hundred li.

"Back then, Venom King Xin Xuan was caught outside sect territory. You're trapped inside—nowhere to run," the Hanging Bird said. "Should we surrender?"

"If we do, the Peak Master won't protect us. He'd silence us," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "He's using the entire sect to hunt you!"

"Every city, town, and village is on alert. Even dogs and birds might be spies. Attacking the mine humiliated the sect. If you escape easily, every expert in the world would raid the mines and leave unscathed."

"The sect won't let you go. Even for a spectacle, this is too extreme..."

"He *wants* it extreme!" Li Zhengjing growled. "I'm an unripe fruit, and he's using the sect to crush me."

"If I'm mediocre, the one who planted me won't care. But if I shine bright enough, they'll save me."

He drew his saber. "There's no escape in sect territory. The only way out... is to outshine everyone. The planter will come for me then."

He turned back, resolve hardening. "Lu Huaiyuan is the sect's brightest star. If I surpass him, I'll shine brighter. I'm going after him!"
