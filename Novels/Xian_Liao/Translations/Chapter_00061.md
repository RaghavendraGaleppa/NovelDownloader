# Chapter 61: Fushan

By the small river, Zhou Qing regulated his breathing through cultivation exercises, spitting out a mouthful of blood to alleviate his injuries. 

Looking at his reflection in the water, his face was deathly pale. He never imagined that the greatest life-and-death crisis since his transmigration would come from... an old madman.

Recalling the scene he had just witnessed, Zhou Qing gained a clear understanding of how terrifying a Xiantian master could be. The old madman had actually engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a demonic beast like the red python and even temporarily gained the upper hand, driving it away. 

Moreover, from a great distance, the old madman had detected Zhou Qing's presence and pounced on him with speed surpassing that of a cheetah. The brief exchange left Zhou Qing shaken. Had he not immediately used the Tiger's Roar Soul Suppression technique, escaping—let alone surviving—would have been nearly impossible.

Well, to be precise, it wasn't exactly an escape. After using Soul Suppression, the old madman stopped attacking and simply followed him from afar. No matter how Zhou Qing tried to hide in the dense forest, the old madman easily found him each time.

Why not go after the red python instead? Zhou Qing had initially hoped the old madman and the python would exhaust each other in battle, allowing him to reap the benefits. But reality had other plans...

However, Zhou Qing did deduce the old madman's identity—he was likely Fushan, the eldest senior brother. It wasn't that Zhou Qing's Tiger's Roar Soul Suppression was particularly powerful; rather, the technique triggered some memories in the old madman, making him recall something and thus hold back against Zhou Qing.

As for why the old madman had sought out and fought the red python, Zhou Qing wasn't sure yet. Could it be that one madman and one python both wanted to dominate the mountain forest, leading to an epic battle?

Zhou Qing refused to entertain the thought that the old madman might have sought out the python because of the seven-leaf ginseng it guarded. Although, given the old madman's cultivation level, it was entirely possible he had instinctively discovered the ginseng deep in the mountains. With his years of herb-gathering experience, he might have unconsciously waited for the seven-leaf ginseng to mature into an eight-leaf variant before consuming it.

After all, the difference between a seven-leaf and eight-leaf ginseng was undoubtedly vast. It was possible that a seven-leaf ginseng would have minimal effect on a Xiantian master like the old madman, hence his instinctive patience.

Regardless, thanks to Soul Suppression, Zhou Qing had survived the encounter with the old madman. And it wasn't even due to the technique's power—Zhou Qing could tell that even with the enhancement of tiger aura, Soul Suppression had negligible effect on the old madman.

Soul Suppression was, after all, a secret art from the Rejuvenation Talisman Canon, sharing the same lineage as the old madman's techniques. Moreover, Fusong had mentioned that the elder senior brother had always abhorred infighting among sect members, a sentiment stemming from the internal strife that once plagued Qingfu Temple.

Fusong had been vague about that incident, and disciples like Zhishan either hadn't joined the sect at the time or were too young to remember what exactly had happened.

From Fushan's notes, Zhou Qing had gleaned some information. It seemed related to the origins of Qingfu Temple's talisman canons. Yet how the origins of these canons could spark such devastating internal conflict, leading to brothers turning on each other, was baffling.

But not harming one's own was undoubtedly ingrained in the old madman's instincts. Otherwise, he wouldn't have immediately ceased his attack upon seeing Zhou Qing use Soul Suppression.

At Qingfu Temple, Zhishan and the others gathered around the disheveled, deranged old Taoist, not daring to approach. Anyone who got too close would be inexplicably sent flying. Fortunately, the old Taoist became calmer upon entering the temple. As long as no one approached him, he remained peaceful.

Zhishan placed the old Taoist's favorite dishes at a distance, and the old man used some inexplicable movement technique to instantly appear by the food, grabbing it with his dirty hands without hesitation. In the blink of an eye, the food was gone. Tears in his eyes, Zhishan brought more dishes. The old Taoist ate heartily, but everyone still kept their distance.

Fusong emerged from his secluded meditation chamber upon receiving the news. "So Senior Brother really is alive," he murmured, his expression complex, tinged with a hint of joy.

After the old madman finished eating, Fusong attempted to approach him. The moment he used the Eight Trigrams Dragon Subduing Palm, the mad Taoist counterattacked. With every movement, his tendons and bones resonated like thunder. Fusong was sent flying within moments, though he managed to land steadily without injury.

Watching from the side, Zhou Qing gained a deeper appreciation for the terror of a Xiantian master. The sheer power in every motion, the instinctive ability to pinpoint an opponent's weaknesses—it was like a hunter toying with prey, striking precisely at vital points. Fusong's Eight Trigrams Dragon Subduing Palm was defeated before it could even demonstrate its might.

Yet... Zhou Qing could clearly see that the old madman had held back. Otherwise, Fusong would have been injured too. So was Zhou Qing the only one who had suffered the old madman's brutal assault? 

It seemed that while others were repelled by the old Taoist's instinctive defenses, none were seriously harmed. Compared to his ferocious battle with the red python in the mountains, the old madman was now remarkably "well-behaved" within Qingfu Temple.

Fusong brushed off his Taoist robes. "A Xiantian martial cultivator has already touched the Dao. We are no match for him."

Zhou Qing asked, "Senior Brother Fusong, that thunderous resonance from Senior Brother Fushan's movements—is that unique to the Xiantian realm?" Having practiced the Five Organs Thunder Resonance himself, Zhou Qing was particularly sensitive to such physical manifestations.

Fusong replied, "You'll understand this sooner or later on your own, but since you asked, I'll tell you. It's a body-refining method derived from thunder resonance, inspired by our Taoist predecessors' observations of heavenly lightning."

One tree, one rooster—this arrangement was more reliable than any guard. It was why Zhou Qing could sleep soundly and securely.

After a restful night, Zhou Qing rose at dawn for his morning exercises, then prepared for his journey with his usual caution. 

"Staying true to one's original resolve is the mark of a true hero!" This prudence was something he would maintain indefinitely.

Once everything was ready, the head escort from Weiyuan Escort Agency arrived. Learning that Zhou Qing was heading to the Taihe Sect's ceremony, the escort had detoured to accompany him. Zhou Qing had no objections.

With Weiyuan Escort's business flourishing, the head escort's influence within the agency had grown. He was deeply grateful for Zhou Qing's support.

Looking around Zhou Qing's modest courtyard, the head escort marveled. With the wealth Zhou Qing had amassed over the past two years, he could have expanded his residence tenfold—a move entirely befitting a provincial examination champion like him. Yet Zhou Qing chose to remain in his small home or reside in mountain temples, far from worldly noise.

"Master Zhou approaches every matter, great or small, with utmost dedication. His solitude amidst potential luxury speaks volumes. Whether as a partner or a follower, only a hero like him can provide a sense of security in these turbulent times," the head escort mused.

"Shall we depart, Head Escort?"

Looking at the composed Zhou Qing, the escort recalled the fates of Golden Light Temple and Seasand Gang. Refined and courteous in daily life, yet striking like thunder when provoked! As someone aligned with Zhou Qing, even a mere escort like him felt an overwhelming sense of safety. The thought flashed through his mind as he bowed.

"Of course. Please mount up, Master Zhou. Let us set forth."

The red python was unlikely to reappear anytime soon, and with Fushan and Fusong guarding Qingfu Temple, Zhou Qing had no pressing concerns. He instructed Miss Lin and Butcher Hu to seek Fusong's help for significant martial matters, while official affairs could proceed as usual. "We all eat from the same pot—who would dare break it?" he reasoned.

Before departing, Zhou Qing returned to his courtyard. The young mulberry leaves had grown rapidly, now lush and vibrant. Yet an eerie chill permeated the yard, keeping insects at bay.

His rooster, Morning Sun, naturally followed him down the mountain, maintaining its usual respectful distance from the mulberry tree.

Zhou Qing tossed a failed elixir pill to the tree's roots, where it promptly vanished. He sensed the mulberry tree's delight.

"Mulberry... you're welcome," Zhou Qing said, catching himself before calling it "Brother Mulberry." Wait, was it Sister Mulberry instead? That felt... odd.

Morning Sun strutted proudly nearby—after all, it had consumed two failed pills! The Tiger King clearly valued his loyal subordinate more. Hadn't it braved dangers alongside him in the deep mountains?

Seeing that the mulberry tree hadn't borne any fruit after consuming the pill, Zhou Qing sighed. It seemed only by absorbing demonic spirits like the ghost fox could the tree produce mulberries. These berries, refined from spiritual energy, could be called spirit fruits or soul fruits. And if not for offering them to Zhou Qing, the tree probably wouldn't bear fruit at all.

Having spent little time at home this winter, Zhou Qing felt somewhat distant from the mulberry tree. He took out some snake scales—thin and sharp—and began practicing his Finger Flick Technique on the tree's leaves from about fifty feet away. This was their unspoken默契 (tacit understanding), the way they had always supported each other.

Compared to iron pellets, the scales were stealthier and lighter, though less powerful. Their sharpness, however, allowed Zhou Qing to refine the subtlety of his energy. It was meticulous work, but good practice nonetheless. With explosive bursts of Gang energy, even the scales could become lethal.

The scales—some red, some green—had been caught by Morning Sun. Zhou Qing had never encountered such snakes in his mountain expeditions, but their meat had indeed aided his cultivation.

Using iron pellets versus scales for the Finger Flick Technique offered entirely different experiences—one solid and forceful, the other light and agile.

Zhou Qing repeatedly adjusted his angles, targeting a single leaf until a branch, studded with embedded scales, finally broke off. The severed branch, vibrant yet tinged with an eerie aura, helped calm the energy stirred by his practice. The mulberry tree remained his anchor for tranquility.

Next, Zhou Qing practiced Shadowless Kick against the tree. With progress in the Deer Play Mantra, his kicking technique had improved. The Deer Play Mantra itself was nearing proficiency, further strengthening his liver.

Cultivating the five organs enhanced vitality. Ordinary martial artists might develop formidable external strength, but their fragile internal organs made recovery from severe injuries difficult without expert medical intervention like Fushan or Zhou Qing could provide. Even then, further advancement required rare medicinal aids.

Zhou Qing's organ training granted him remarkable resilience. His recovery from Fushan's attack had been swift, aided by the Five Animals Exercises' self-healing properties—external for the basic form, internal for the advanced Organ Exercises.

With Fushan as a benchmark, Zhou Qing grew ever more eager to reach Xiantian. He was confident that mastering the Five Organs Thunder Resonance and fully developing his physique would lead to marrow cleansing, rebirth, and natural ascension to Xiantian—whether in three, five, or ten years. All he needed was persistent effort.

"Right, Health Master?" he mused.

Before that, aside from consulting the Taihe Sect about the Triple Burner and completing the "Hei" sound in the Six-Word Health Mantra, Zhou Qing considered advancing his Literary Courage. He believed stronger Literary Courage would aid his breakthrough to Xiantian or other challenges. It had remained at the initial stage for too long.

Progress would require writing a timeless essay resonating with his spirit and intent. Though he could plagiarize, his mindset at the time must align perfectly with the text, as if in harmony with the heavens. Such opportunities were serendipitous—cultivation itself relied on fate's whims.

Thus, Zhou Qing slept peacefully in his courtyard that night, guarded by the mulberry tree's newfound majesty and Morning Sun's vigilant presence. One tree, one rooster—more reliable than any human sentinel. 

At dawn, refreshed, Zhou Qing resumed his routine with unwavering caution. True heroes never forget their roots. 

When the head escort arrived, impressed by Zhou Qing's humble abode, he thought, "Master Zhou's meticulousness in all things, his choice of solitude over luxury—only such a hero can provide stability in these chaotic times."

"Shall we go?" Zhou Qing asked.

The escort bowed. "After you, Master Zhou."

With the red python unlikely to return and Qingfu Temple secure under Fushan and Fusong, Zhou Qing set off without worries, leaving instructions for his allies. United they stood—who would dare challenge them? 

Before leaving, he visited his courtyard one last time. The thriving mulberry tree exuded quiet authority, while Morning Sun kept its proud distance. 

Tossing a failed pill to the roots, Zhou Qing felt the tree's gratitude. "Mulberry... you're welcome," he said, catching himself before the habitual "Brother." Sister? That felt strange.

Morning Sun preened—it had earned two pills! The Tiger King clearly favored his loyal companion. Hadn't it risked life and limb with him in the wilds?

Seeing no fruit on the tree, Zhou Qing sighed. Only demonic spirits like the ghost fox could induce fruiting. These soul-refining berries were the tree's gifts to him alone.

Reconnecting with the tree through Finger Flick practice, Zhou Qing marveled at their默契 (tacit understanding). Scales versus iron pellets honed different skills—precision versus power. The embedded scales finally severed a branch, its dual nature calming his energies. 

Shadowless Kick improved alongside the Deer Play Mantra, strengthening his liver. Organ cultivation boosted vitality—a stark contrast to external martial artists' fragility. 

Fushan's example fueled Zhou Qing's Xiantian aspirations. With perseverance, marrow cleansing and rebirth would come. 

"Health Master knows," he affirmed.

Advancing Literary Courage required a resonant masterpiece—timing was key. 

That night, guarded by tree and rooster, Zhou Qing slept soundly, ready for the journey ahead at dawn. 

The escort, awed by Zhou Qing's humility, thought, "In chaos, such a man is our anchor."

"Let's go," Zhou Qing said.

Bowing, the escort replied, "At your command, Master Zhou." 

United and prepared, they departed.
