# Chapter 403: The Origin of the Nine Heavens, the Dream Fiend

The murals depicted the cataclysm of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, when the sky collapsed and the earth sank. Following this, nine immortals returned from the Heavenly Realm to mend the heavens and earth. According to the records of the Celestial Derivation Sect, these nine individuals were later revered as the Nine Heavens. Do you know of the Nine Heavens?

Tian Miao looked at the two of them with an inscrutable expression.

"I have heard of them," Ying Bing said expressionlessly, nodding.

"You've actually heard of them?" Tian Miao's eyes flashed with surprise.

"A little," the former strongest of the Nine Heavens, Ice Cube, replied with a slight nod.

Li Mo glanced at her, thinking to himself that the "Phoenix Empress" from Ice Cube's destiny might be one of the Nine Heavens. With insufficient information, he couldn't be sure, so he asked Tian Miao again, "Does the Nine Heavens refer to the legacies of those nine saviors?"

"At first, it might have been. However, as the world turns and time is relentless, even immortals like them would fade away with the passage of time. Thus, they would select the most outstanding and brilliant cultivators from various sects of the current era to pass down their traditions."

"Those who successfully inherit the Nine Heavens are all the strongest figures in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. However, although they are powerful, they remain detached from the mortal world, only appearing when the world faces great upheaval."

Hearing this, Li Mo couldn't help but think of a term: the invisible guardians?

"That was how it was at first, but what about later?"

"Later, perhaps due to internal problems among the Nine Heavens or some other accident, the legacy was severed. The Nine Heavens gradually evolved into a title for the nine strongest individuals in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands," Tian Miao said with deep emotion.

"Who are the current Nine Heavens?" Li Mo asked curiously.

"I don't know," Tian Miao answered straightforwardly. "The Celestial Derivation Sect is not omniscient. At least three types of existences' fates are beyond our divination and unclear to us."

"The first type are transcendent, sage-like powerhouses. Some cultivators at the seventh realm, the Profound Manifestation Realm, who have a deep understanding of the Great Dao, will see their fates begin to blur, let alone those at the eighth realm, the Heaven-Connecting Realm."

"The second type are those who possess divine artifacts that can conceal their destiny."

"The third type are existences that do not belong to the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands."

As he said the last part, Tian Miao stared intently at Li Mo.

Ying Bing slightly furrowed her brows, her jade-like face gradually turning cold.

"Hmm, I did indeed receive a legacy of a very great origin," Li Mo nodded.

"?" Tian Miao narrowed his eyes, about to ask further.

But Li Mo, who had been acting as if nothing was wrong, suddenly put on a grave expression and said in a deep voice, "The jade pendant is burning hot!" He then added, "This time, it's for real!"

Tian Miao was taken aback. Could the jade pendant she made be fake?

Behind them, a light sound was heard. A black shadow gradually became clear under the soft light of the pearl. It was three figures, their bodies shimmering with a metallic luster. Their clothes were tattered, but one could barely tell they were once members of the Demon Summoning Cult, likely high-ranking priests.

However, their faces were now terrifying, their eyes filled with nothing but a thirst for living beings. Moreover, shadows swirled around them, as thick as black water, distorting space. A single glance made one's head dizzy and spirit listless.

"Domain?!"

The word simultaneously appeared in the three of them minds.

Sizzle—

Li Mo immediately activated the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body. Behind him, the Great Sage's Intent and the Yin Divine Intent appeared, and he entered a battle state in an instant. The clear radiance enveloped his form, dispelling the drowsiness in his mind.

Woo—

The moment his consciousness cleared, a jet-black claw was already before his eyes.

Clang!!

The Crimson Dawn Sword moved faster than the forty, piercing through the air to stab the opponent's palm. However, this Fiend was clearly extremely powerful in life; otherwise, it would have turned to dust long ago. Furthermore, its body had been tempered by Yin-Spirit Qi for who knows how many thousands of years, making its physical form even stronger than it was in life.

The Crimson Dawn Sword scraped against it, producing a series of sparks, leaving only white scratches.

But as everyone knows, what is Little Li's nickname?

He drew his sword first only because sword techniques are light and swift, giving him a moment's time.

Forty silently fell into his palm.

The surrounding space suddenly solidified.

The Star Pole Staff surged with the power of wind and thunder. The Great Sage's Intent opened its eyes, its gaze of golden fire burning through the shadows, from which faint wails could be heard. Faces of agony seemed to surface within the shadows.

Li Mo raised the Star Pole Staff and surged upward along the path illuminated by the fire.

"Roar!"

The shadow of the staff grew larger in the Fiend's eyes, and its roar carried a hint of fear.

Thud—

A solid hit.

The Fiend stood straight.

How to describe its experience of waking from a slumber of several thousand years?

It got up, and was instantly flattened. What more is there to say?

"This Fiend is a bit strange," Li Mo said, looking at its crushed body with a grave expression.

Unfortunately, the Fiend could no longer hear him. Otherwise, it might have sat up in its deathbed, thinking, "I can not only use a domain, but my physical body is also stronger than a typical Inner Scenery cultivator, yet you flattened me with a single strike. Who is the real strange one here?"

Actually, it's understandable. Although Li Mo is only at the sixth realm of the Observing Deity Realm, he is using a supreme art at its pinnacle. He bears two Great Dao ultimate forms, his physical body is comparable to a Calamity Beast, and he has seven Xuan Dantians inside him. Who in their right mind has such powerful spiritual sense, techniques, and physical body...

In layman's terms.

Is the nickname "Divine Hammer Little Tyrant" just for show?

"It was already dead, yet it could activate something like a domain," said Ice Cube, who had finished her battle the earliest, her face deep in thought.

That domain... it's similar to the Black Year Beast's, but weaker...

"That is a Dream Domain," Tian Miao said, having also finished her battle. The Fiend she faced was covered in true characters, its aura returning to silence.

"Dream Domain... So can this be called a Dream Fiend?"

This was the first time Li Mo had heard of a zombie with such a peculiar name. So, the miscellaneous things given by Elder Qian, like donkey hooves, are probably useless...

"The Demon Summoning Cult once had a branch called Yunmeng. They could walk through the dreams of others and grow stronger in their sleep. By the time they reached the Outer Scenery Realm, they could even turn things from dreams into reality."

"However, this branch suddenly vanished later on. I didn't expect to find them here."

"The identity of the tomb's owner..." Tian Miao looked towards the leftmost figure on the mural, the leftmost of the nine.
