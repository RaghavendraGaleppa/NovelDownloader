# Chapter 257: Finally Escaped, Will Marry the Jade Maiden?

The immortal crane spread its wings, blotting out the sky and sun, holding a vermilion immortal pill in its beak. Its eyes were bright and spirited as it curiously sized up Li Xian.

"Guest from the clouds, please take the crane's pill."

Lü Dongzhi was bold and unrestrained.

His martial cultivation was superb, and the tomb's layout was magnificent. The world believed that deep within the tomb lay a great inheritance, yet he placed it outside.

The world explored ancient tombs for wealth and treasure. Yet he made those who left empty-handed return with full loads. The immortal crane had a spirit and considerable intelligence. It inhabited the tomb for generations, abiding by Lü Dongzhi's final command: seeing those who left empty-handed, it would offer a pill.

As the saying goes, "Guest from the clouds, please take the crane's pill."

It meant... entering the tomb for a tour was considered being a guest. Since one was a guest, how could they steal the host's treasures? Leaving the tomb empty-handed meant one was the tomb's "guest."

Since one was a "guest," then please take the crane's pill.

Lü Dongzhi had long since made clear where the treasure was, but no one understood. He had many disciples in his lifetime, but very few were truly open-minded and free-spirited. This ethereal and free charm was something no one could learn even a fraction of.

Conversely...

Those tomb-raiding thieves, after cracking the tomb's mechanisms, would surely collect famous paintings and precious artifacts... Lü Dongzhi had been dead for thousands of years and could not stop them. But they missed the best treasure.

Li Xian caught the vermilion immortal pill and cupped his hands in salute. "Thank you, Senior!" Without waiting to look closely, he stored it in his sleeve. He grabbed Wen Caishang and quickly fled.

Wen Caishang had long known that the "Nanyang Gentleman" had an eccentric temperament, difficult to judge by common sense. That era was full of strife, with chaotic rites and bizarre ethics. There were noble gentlemen and brutal villains.

She was selfish by nature, yet seeing Li Xian receive the immortal pill without any intention of taking it, she felt happy for him instead.

On the other side.

Shen Pingping was well-versed in tomb layouts. He had robbed and dug up corpses from tombs in Nanyang, Dayu, Dawu, and even older times.

The mainstream layouts of Nanyang-era tombs included "Four Directions Tomb," "Eight Immortals Tomb," "Nine Dragons Tomb," and other patterns.

This tomb clearly followed the "Four Directions Tomb" pattern. That is, the tomb was divided into four areas, stabilizing the four directions and encompassing the four seas. Shen Pingping already knew the tomb belonged to Lü Dongzhi.

Although he understood the tomb's layout clearly, his knowledge of "antiquity and modernity" was far inferior to Wen Caishang's. He did not know much about Lü Dongzhi.

He led the way and soon found the "Four Sages Cave." Seeing the cave door tightly closed and emitting a strange odor, he frowned slightly. He did not see Zhao Zhiyuan.

Su Qiuwu said, "Could she have escaped again?"

Shen Pingping said, "Regardless, let's open the cave and check."

"Logically... it shouldn't be. The Four Sages Cave is a dead end, and Zhao Zhiyuan blocked the entrance. It would be extremely difficult to escape!"

Shen Pingping felt around the mechanism, exploring the area around the cave entrance. After spending most of the day, he opened the cave door.

With a "rumble," mercury and lead surged out. Shen Pingping and Su Qiuwu dodged to the side, holding their breath and frowning, protecting themselves. After a long while, the mercury and lead flowed out completely, revealing the scene inside.

Zhao Zhiyuan lay on the ground, his body swollen. Su Qiuwu untied the silk ribbon from his waist, threw it out, wrapped it around Zhao Zhiyuan's body, and pulled hard.

Zhao Zhiyuan was dragged out of the Four Sages Cave. His breath had ceased, and his body was covered in horrific injuries: an arrow in his chest, a knife wound on his abdomen, burns on his skin... He must have gone through an extremely fierce battle.

Su Qiuwu was startled. He knew Zhao Zhiyuan's strength. Suffering such injuries, he must have been schemed against by someone before his death, unable to exert his full power.

Zhao Zhiyuan suddenly opened his eyes and roared, "Chong..." His expression was one of shock, but then he stiffened completely, dead for good.

Shen Pingping clapped his hands and laughed. "Good, good!"

"Hmph!" Su Qiuwu甩袖 (shuǎi xiù - flicked his sleeve) and snorted coldly. He was skilled at scheming. Seeing Zhao Zhiyuan's death, he felt a sense of "the fox mourning the hare's death." He was terrified of Wen Caishang. They had met and fought several times. He had the upper hand in strength each time, yet he failed every time, suffering heavy losses.

If ordinary disciples died, it would be nothing. But Zhao Zhiyuan was a formidable Third Realm martial artist. Even if he had just entered the Third Realm and was in a weakened state, he was defeated by Li Xian, a First Realm martial artist, and Wen Caishang, a powerless废人 (fèi rén - useless person).

Thinking about it sent chills down his spine.

Shen Pingping said awkwardly, "Brother Su, please don't misunderstand. I am not gloating. It's just... just that Brother Zhao's death is excellent material for refining 'Fierce-Eyed Corpse'."

"This kind of corpse must have suffered immense terror and anger before death, dying in endless regret. He suddenly opened his eyes and mouth just now, speaking 'corpse words,' trying his dying breath to reveal something to the outside world."

"Huh?" Su Qiuwu said, "He said the word 'Chong' (Heavy). What does 'Chong' represent?"

Even with his agile mind, with just the single word "Chong," how could he deduce anything? He thought it over but found no clues.

Just then, Li Quan and Qi Beidao also arrived. Although the two were not familiar with the tomb passages, their lightness skills were excellent, and their speed was incredibly fast. They wandered east and west, made a few turns, and gradually found their way.

Su Qiuwu explained the situation. Li Quan and Qi Beidao were both startled. Seeing Zhao Zhiyuan's tragic death, their feelings were complex. Su Qiuwu remained very calm. He thought that with Zhao Zhiyuan dead, he had lost another powerful ally. The more so at this time, he must stay calm and make various plans.

He gathered everyone and came to a tomb chamber. They sat on the coffin, integrating their respective clues and experiences... all kinds of details.

Su Qiuwu asked, "You two were quite fast. I thought I would have to wait a few more days for you."

Li Quan said coldly, "We heard that the demoness has a tomb map in her possession. Naturally, we couldn't sit still."

"A map?" Su Qiuwu paused, his eyes lighting up. "Really? Where did you hear that?"

Li Quan said, "Hmph, Su Qiuwu, stop pretending! The messenger boy said so. Don't tell me you don't know?"

Su Qiuwu said, "Strange! I also rushed here because someone told me. But the messenger boy didn't mention a 'map' to me."

At this point, everyone felt something was off. Su Qiuwu said, "That Li Xian is extremely cunning, and Wen Caishang is extremely vicious... The two of them are in cahoots, an adulterous couple, with endless strange and dangerous schemes!"

"Zhao Zhiyuan fell here, and they must have escaped again. If they really have a map, they would want to leave the tomb as soon as possible. And you two were guarding the exit... they..."

His heart skipped a beat, and he said失声 (shī shēng - involuntarily), "Could it be... could it be... that messenger boy was Li Xian! He deliberately mentioned the map to spur you to rush here!"

"Ah!" Li Quan was greatly shocked.

Su Qiuwu said, "When the boy delivered the message, why didn't you bring him back with you?"

Qi Beidao's expression changed. "I... I said it felt off! I wanted to bring him along, but Brother Li refused, so I had to drop it!"

Li Quan shook his head. "No... that's not right. That kid begged me to take him away. If he were Li Xian, how could he make such a request?"

Su Qiuwu said coldly, "Tell me the details of the conversation!" Qi Beidao immediately recounted Li Xian's words in full.

After listening, Su Qiuwu sighed and shook his head. "What a deep scheme, what a deep calculation, what a 'counter-movement' tactic. It's almost certainly... Li Xian!"

He let out a heavy breath, his back slumping, unable to hide his dejection. He said:

"He knew Li Quan resented me and Zhao Zhiyuan. So he主动 (zhǔdòng - proactively) asked Li Quan for help, and Li Quan would surely refuse. That way, he wouldn't have to come along!"

Shen Pingping and Qi Beidao exclaimed, "No wonder they kept escaping along the way and we couldn't catch them. They are truly extremely difficult to deal with!"

Li Quan's face turned ashen. Even if he was slow-witted, after this hint and careful consideration, he sensed the anomaly. Li Xian had escaped from before his eyes three times. Such a great humiliation... it was a fight to the death!

Su Qiuwu looked utterly dejected, having no energy to blame Li Quan for his stupidity. He thought back carefully. He had been arrogant and proud, manipulating people's hearts, causing the Sword Hunting Alliance to develop mutual grievances. Li Xian, with his cunning mind, exploited these grievances to find a way out.

Li Quan was indeed stupid. But Li Xian was also extremely formidable. On the way... he might have brushed past him several times.

The four of them regained their composure. They chased to the side of the peak and saw a vast green sea, a boundless expanse, with no trace of Li Xian or Wen Caishang.

They thought again that the two had a map and might be able to leave Tiger Cry Ridge. Their temples suddenly turned white, their bodies shivered with cold, and their spirit was crushed.

Su Qiuwu said, "The Sword Hunting Alliance... has failed."

"The Folding Sword Madam?"

"The adulterous couple... that adulterer, given time, will likely be more formidable than the harlot!"

The crowd fell silent. Listening to the wind and the crane's cries, they were at a loss. They had lost their goal and were trapped in a predicament. If their luck was bad, they might be trapped for life...

They had suffered heavy losses, and Zhao Zhiyuan had died tragically. They no longer had the courage to chase into the forest. If they couldn't find a map, they would have to survive by relying on these mountains.

On the other side.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang left the tomb mountain. The humid, stifling air rushed at them. After walking a few miles, they were already sweating profusely.

Li Xian was burdened with various injuries and was not at ease. He sat on a vine to rest, with the two of them leaning on each other.

Li Xian said, "Madam, although we've shaken off the pursuit... but... but I didn't get the map. We'll have to wander in this vast sea of forest."

Wen Caishang's heart sank, but a faint sweetness was hidden within. She said, "Li Lang... it's just our bad luck. There's nothing we can do. From now on... we... we... should be good..." Her pretty face flushed.

Li Xian suddenly said, "Ah... my chest hurts so much. Madam, help me rub it." Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes filled with worry, guessing that her sword strike had wounded Li Xian deeply. A strong feeling of pity washed over her, and she quickly reached out to touch him.

The moment her long, slender, white fingers entered his chest, she touched a roll of leather. She took it out and looked—it was a map of a corner of the tomb mountain, the mysterious mountain range, and Tiger Cry Ridge.

The trends of the mountain ranges, where there were rest forests, where there were streams, where the dangers were that should be avoided... all were recorded in great detail. Following this map, they could surely leave the mountain range and truly escape to freedom!

Wen Caishang was ecstatic and coquettishly said, "You臭小子 (chòu xiǎozi - stinky kid), you dared to trick me!" Li Xian laughed. "I wanted to surprise the Madam."

Wen Caishang said, "I hate being tricked the most. If you trick me again, see if I'll ever pay attention to you again!" Her charm was captivating. Li Xian laughed. "I wouldn't dare again. Please don't be angry, Madam."

"Alright," Wen Caishang said softly. "How could I be willing to be angry with you? You... you've done so much for me, I'm so grateful to you. Let's leave the forest quickly!"

Li Xian and Wen Caishang rested for a moment. They followed the map's directions. The map said: "The terrain here is very chaotic, disrupting the stars and direction. Do not rely on your sense of direction."

"You must follow the earth's veins. Protrusions in the ground are veins, flowing water is the network..."

Li Xian and Wen Caishang walked over ten miles. Before dusk, they reached a rest forest. The sky was filled with brilliant stars, moonlight bathed the fields, and starlight shone on the myriad trees.

Li Xian thought: "Since the Madam suffered a setback, I have gone through many waves: killing enemies to avoid disaster, entering the tomb to seek treasure... but I am also very weary. Although we have escaped our predicament, I expect that Su Qiuwu and the others will find it hard to catch up. However... the more so at times like this, the less we can relax!"

The Five Organs Expelling Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian, the Crane's Vermilion Jade Pill, the Sword Control Technique: Recipes... the many gains were temporarily buried in his heart. He devoted his full attention to studying the map, simulating how to walk.

The next day.

The sky had just cleared.

Li Xian's water bag and food were both empty. But this place was still close to the tomb. If Su Qiuwu were to chase desperately, he might happen upon them.

So he endured hunger and hardship, forcefully walking over ten miles of mountain paths.

He passed two rest forests and saw that the mysterious mountain range was like a vast ocean, with the rest forests resembling remote islands. They were already dozens of miles from the tomb mountain. The probability of Su Qiuwu and the others finding them here without a map was extremely small, so there was no need to worry.

That night, they could finally rest properly. Li Xian cut soft grass, felled some Luo cloth fir trees, and made a simple wooden bed, laying it with soft grass.

A campfire burned beside them.

Li Xian held Wen Caishang, blowing in the forest's cool breeze, gazing at the bright moon and jade-like stars. No longer threatened by life and death, no longer fleeing in a sorry state, his heart enjoyed peace.

His thoughts were too heavy. Since crossing over, he had constantly thought about his situation, his status, and sought survival... Although he had repeatedly "passed trials and slain foes," the fatigue had been accumulating in his heart.

At this moment, looking at the star charts, he felt increasingly drowsy. Li Xian closed his eyes and fell asleep. Wen Caishang saw Li Xian in her arms. Today, he wasn't saying annoying words or flirting to get beaten. She found it quite strange.

She suddenly thought: "If not for his help, even with ten lives, I would have died. His talent is unparalleled through the ages, and his appearance is also handsome. I didn't see wrongly in him. He has an extraordinary bearing. Although he is young, he is very smart. This clever and calm attitude makes me rely on him."

It was like sugar, like honey. She cherished him dearly. Her fingers played with his sideburns, stroked his cheeks, and her beautiful eyes shimmered with light.

"...But... but he is so dishonest! He tricked me before, and now he tricks me... I don't know how many times he has tricked me. He... he risked danger to save me, does he love me? He once said he loved me to death, that he would dream of me, was he also lying?"

Her thoughts were in a mess. She gazed at Li Xian for a long time, yet she had no trace of sleepiness. Tossing and turning, she felt even more confused, and worried about gains and losses.

Li Xian slept until noon the next day. When he woke up, he reproached himself, "I overslept! I overslept!" He had planned to collect dew to drink on the journey.

Wen Caishang had thought of many things the previous night and stayed awake until dawn. She pretended to be asleep, lying beside Li Xian.

Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes were complex. She suddenly asked, "Xiao Xian, you slept so soundly last night. Did you dream?"

Li Xian laughed casually, "My beautiful dream came true, so why would I need to dream?" He stretched, feeling very comfortable. The scent of her hair lingered on his chest.

Wen Caishang嗔道 (chēn dào - coquettishly said), "I'm asking you a real question, you're not allowed to flirt." Her tone was serious; she really wanted to know.

Li Xian didn't think too much and said truthfully, "I was too tired last night, I didn't dream." Wen Caishang thought: "I was right beside you last night, and you didn't dream of me. You... you... were you really lying to me before?" Her face paled slightly.

Li Xian asked with concern, "Madam, are you hurt?" He felt her pulse and checked her injuries. Wen Caishang was originally quite sad, but seeing Li Xian's attentive care, she felt sweet again.

"I'm fine, let's leave quickly," Wen Caishang said.

Li Xian took out the map, held the Sinking River Sword, and劈树开路 (pī shù kāi lù - chopped trees to clear a path). On the remaining journey, although the dense forest was still dangerous, there were occasional rest forests to rest in.

They handled everything with ease.

They walked over ten miles a day and continued like this for several days.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang's clothes were torn by tree branches. They patched them up and rested intermittently before continuing on their way.

Li Xian's sword wound had scabbed over, and the injury on his arm was gradually healing. He was about thirty percent better. Wen Caishang gathered herbs from the forest, prepared medicinal ointment, and helped Li Xian apply it.

Her fingers were slender and white. When applying the medicine, she would撩拨 (liáo bō - flirtatiously touch) him intentionally or unintentionally. Her beautiful eyes contained spring and expectation, incredibly moving. Li Xian vaguely felt that Wen Caishang was different, showing more feminine charm.

He traveled through the wilderness by day and studied the map by night. Although he had the map, the mountain range's terrain was shrouded, and it was not easy to step out of Tiger Cry Ridge.

It was by no means a worry-free situation.

Time passed.

In the blink of an eye, five days had passed. The two were together every day, and their expressions had become intimate. Wen Caishang was sometimes like a teacher, sometimes charming, while Li Xian was flighty and unrestrained. The journey was surprisingly interesting.

One day.

Li Xian saw black smoke in the distance and laughed. "Madam! It's cooking smoke. We've finally seen a trace of human presence!"

Wen Caishang said, "Yes! It's really not easy."

The black smoke drifted and dispersed, and the forest was quiet. After a moment of joy, the two worked together to move forward. Here, the "poisonous leeches" were no longer numerous, but a kind of poisonous flower bloomed. The flower's fragrance attracted "poisonous snakes," "scorpions," "spiders," and other venomous creatures.

Suddenly, they saw three corpses hanging from a short tree in the distance. All were men, dressed in silk robes. The breeze blew, and they swayed gently. They had been dead for about two days.

Li Xian sighed, "Looking at their attire, they should be passing merchants who strayed into Tiger Cry Ridge. They were moved by the sorrowful cries of the tigers and hanged themselves here."

Wen Caishang said, "Seeing them, we should be almost out of the forest!"

Li Xian nodded. "These traveling merchants aren't very strong. They couldn't have gone deep into the forest. With about two more days of travel, we'll be out."

Li Xian thought: "The Madam and I have tattered clothes and no money. Since we've met you, we'll have to borrow from you. Hmm... consider it the reward for helping you bury your bodies!"

Just as he touched the corpse, he suddenly felt movement in his sleeve. Li Xian secretly became alert, took three steps back, and struck out with his Green Luo Palm from a distance.

With a "clatter," venomous insects, scorpions, poisonous bees... many poisonous creatures fell from the trouser legs and sleeves, making one's scalp tingle.

Tiger Cry Ridge was extremely dangerous. Countless snakes, insects, rats, and ants, as well as poisonous beasts, inhabited it. When a person died here, they would immediately attract "cannibal ants." These ant-beasts bit people with extreme pain and existed in enormous numbers.

The cannibal ants attracted "red poisonous frogs," and the red poisonous frogs attracted poisonous snakes... and so on. Naturally, under the robes, it was "filthy" and "a nest of snakes and rats."

Li Xian struck several palms in a row, scattering all the rats, ants, and poisonous creatures. The three corpses, except for their heads, had all turned into "red bones"—bones still attached with flesh.

He pried open their mouths. The brain stems, tongues, eyeballs... all had been eaten by venomous insects. Li Xian dealt with the three corpses one by one, driving away the poisonous insects and stripping off their clothes.

He dug a pit on the spot to bury them, chopped down trees, and erected a simple wooden tablet. As he did not know the surnames and origins of the three, the tablet was left blank.

Li Xian put the clothes away. According to the map, he found a flat terrain. There was a stream nearby, making it safer than other places.

There were no more "rest forests" here.

Li Xian checked his gains. "Three sets of silk clothes," although crawled over by poisonous insects, smelling foul, and stained with blood and filth, they were relatively intact.

He also摸得 (mō dé - felt and obtained) "thirteen taels of silver." It was truly an unexpected joy. Li Xian said, "Madam, with silver, we can have a good meal once we get out!"

Wen Caishang smiled, also feeling happy.

Later, there were waist tablets, jade pendants, and other items. Li Xian took what was appropriate. He threw the three sets of clothes into the stream, scrubbed them clean, and washed away the filth.

Wen Caishang was unwilling to wear other people's clothes. Her white dress was torn but could still last a few days.

The two cleaned everything up.

After walking for another two days, sunlight slanted into the forest, warm and moist. The moment they stepped out of Tiger Cry Ridge, a clear, gentle breeze blew against them, and they felt as if they had been reborn.

It was now the end of the fourth month, the height of spring. Li Xian was full of joy and high spirits. All kinds of hardships could not dampen his spirit. His elegance and brilliance were revealed at this moment.

Wen Caishang prided herself on her deep experience in the Jianghu. The number of outstanding young men who had pursued her in the past was countless. Among them were young masters from famous clans, with immense power, and from first-rate sects... she had looked down on all of them. If it came to potential and talent, some of them were extremely strong.

But they could not conquer her.

Now, seeing Li Xian's full appearance, his perfect physique was a rarely heard talent, and on top of that, the "Heavy Pupil Physique"... if he learned that martial art and combined it with the "Martial Art" and "Rebirth Physique," who in the world could be his match? She could not help but compare everyone she had met with Li Xian.

She thought of Li Xian's rise from a servant, to a guard, to a guard captain, to a military captain... gradually rising. She hadn't thought much of it before, but looking back now, it was extremely impressive.

She couldn't help but stare at him for a long time, sometimes frowning, sometimes relaxing. She sighed softly, "If I had known you would make me so miserable, I wouldn't have nurtured you back then. But then again, if I hadn't nurtured you, how could I have survived this calamity. I... I have escaped danger, but for some reason, my heart is so messy... so messy."

She was extremely troubled; this feeling was hard to describe.

At noon.

Li Xian saw a dirt road and followed it. In the evening, they saw a peaceful mountain village, with cooking smoke rising. They also met an old man carrying firewood, humming a mountain song as he headed back.

Li Xian took the opportunity to strike up a conversation. He spent ten copper coins to get permission to stay in the firewood shed for a night. In the firewood shed, the old man helped lay a straw mat, and Li Xian and Wen Caishang lay down.

They both felt fortunate, and at that moment, they wanted for nothing.

Li Xian pulled Wen Caishang over and said, "Madam, do you know of a power called 'Yellow Talisman Mountain'?"

Wen Caishang said, "Why are you asking that? Your hands aren't behaving, you want a beating!" She lightly slapped Li Xian's hand away. But Li Xian's flirtatious, annoying actions actually swept away some of her gloom.

Li Xian said, "I'm just asking."

Wen Caishang said, "Yellow Talisman Mountain... I do know, but Yellow Talisman Mountain is no longer called Yellow Talisman Mountain now."

"What is it called?" Li Xian asked.

Wen Caishang said, "Yellow Talisman Mountain is an extremely ancient power. It has survived through the rise, fall, and change of dynasties. Such a power has its own formidable aspects."

"During the Dayu period... Yellow Talisman Mountain underwent a transformation. This event was very famous. After the transformation, Yellow Talisman Mountain changed its name and has been called..."

"Daoxuan Mountain."

"Daoxuan Mountain?" Li Xian had faintly heard of it.

Wen Caishang said, "Yes! Daoxuan Mountain's martial arts are perfected. Its martial arts inheritance spans thousands of years, and its foundation is deep, unimaginable."

"This sect is extremely favored by heaven. Every thousand years, it必生 (bì shēng - must produce) 'Golden Ladle' and 'Jade Maiden'. Leading Daoxuan Mountain to its peak."

Li Xian asked, "Golden Ladle and Jade Maiden? Are they very powerful?"

Wen Caishang flashed a hint of pride. "Naturally, they are powerful. They appear once in a thousand years, and upon emerging, they are rarely matched. In your generation, there happens to be a Golden Ladle and Jade Maiden. Calculating their age... they are a few years older than you."

Li Xian thought: "Golden Ladle and Jade Maiden are blessed by nature, making people envious. But it has nothing to do with me. I'll ask about what concerns me." He said, "Is there a Zhao clan in Daoxuan Mountain?"

Wen Caishang said, "You've gained a lot of knowledge after returning from the ancient tomb. Daoxuan Mountain does have a Zhao clan, which is also the Jade Maiden lineage."

"The Jade Maiden who has emerged in the world now is surnamed Zhao."

Wen Caishang gently brushed her long hair. The bright moonlight set off her elegant figure. She said, "What... are you coveting人家 (rénjiā - someone else's) Jade Maiden? With your talent, you might be able to make her look at you with new eyes."

Li Xian suddenly felt a chill all over, sensing a faint killing intent: "Madam, you're joking. I'm just curious."

Wen Caishang said calmly, "Alright, you've asked me, now it's my turn to ask you."

Her waist was like a water snake, her black hair fragrant, and she actually "coiled" up. Her beautiful eyes seemed sorrowful, resentful, and coquettish. She said softly, "Li Lang, you hid your Heavy Pupils from me so bitterly..."
