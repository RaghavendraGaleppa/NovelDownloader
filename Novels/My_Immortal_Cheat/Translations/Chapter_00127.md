**Chapter 127: Collateral Damage**

For Saint Devil, who had inadvertently "killed" Zhou Tian, he wasn't at all concerned if Zhou Tian was truly dead. Through their recent fierce battle, he had largely come to believe Zhou Tian's words. He had no choice but to believe them; such terrifying methods, if not the work of a Heavenly Venerate, left him unable to conceive of a second possibility.

Since Zhou Tian possessed means laid down by a Heavenly Venerate-level figure, he certainly wouldn't truly die.

Rather than saying he had confidence in Zhou Tian, it was more accurate to say he had confidence in a Heavenly Venerate.

Saint Devil once again sat cross-legged in the air, a glazed light emanating from his brow. His hands formed a treasure vase shape at his abdomen, and a faint, ethereal chanting sound arose. His body glowed, and behind him, a great Buddha seemed to sit.

He was repairing his injuries; each time he forcefully merged his two personalities, it caused a certain degree of damage to his divine soul.

Mu Su and Ling Yu dared not move recklessly, standing rooted to the spot with bitter expressions, praying for Zhou Tian to save them from their plight.

Time flowed quickly. The Undying System's resurrection count refreshed once more, and Zhou Tian resurrected at the exact spot where he had died.

Before he could even react, he felt his body falling downwards, followed by a sensation of spatial and temporal distortion. The scene shifted, and Saint Devil's figure appeared before him.

Before Zhou Tian could speak, Saint Devil waved a hand, and a set of clothes appeared on Zhou Tian's body.

Zhou Tian regained his composure. Although the Undying System had arranged everything meticulously, aiming to minimize the feeling of inflated power and the subsequent sense of loss, that feeling of omnipotence still filled his heart, making him feel a little awkward at the moment.

He moved his somewhat soft limbs, a smile appearing on Zhou Tian's face.

"Senior Saint Devil, do you believe what I said now?"

Though it was a question, Zhou Tian was very confident in its answer.

"Heavenly Venerates are indeed unimaginable existences," Saint Devil sighed, his eyes deep, without directly answering.

*Whether Heavenly Venerates are unimaginable existences, I don't know, but the Undying System must be something unimaginable,* Zhou Tian added silently in his heart.

"I didn't expect there to be so many things in this world that I don't understand." Saint Devil's 'Saint' form seemed a bit melancholic, quite different from the 'Devil' form that had just charged forward with a great halberd. Since he now believed Zhou Tian's words, all of Zhou Tian's fabricated nonsense had also settled into his mind, leaving him feeling slightly emotional.

"Live and learn," Zhou Tian scratched his head, offering that remark.

Saint Devil glanced at him, a faint smile appearing on his face. "I didn't expect the Zhou family to produce such an interesting young fellow like you. You don't seem to regard me as an enemy."

Zhou Tian chuckled, speaking nonchalantly, "What's this talk about enemies? In the end, it's all about interests. If my Zhou family has something Senior Saint Devil needs, I believe we'll certainly be very good friends."

In reality, he was internally grumbling: *If there were a button in front of me that, if pressed, would cause Saint Devil to be humiliated to death by a herd of sows, I would definitely press it without hesitation!*

"Indeed, it's all about interests. Since you have the favor of a Heavenly Venerate, I wouldn't dare do anything to you. You may leave," Saint Devil said indifferently.

Zhou Tian raised an eyebrow. *That's it? I can just leave?*

"Is Senior Saint Devil serious?"

"If you wish to stay and keep me company, you may," Saint Devil said, glancing at him.

"Then, Senior Saint Devil, we shall meet again."

Zhou Tian finished speaking and beckoned Ling Yu and Mu Su to leave. Mu Su and Ling Yu also hastily followed. However, before they had taken two steps, Saint Devil's voice drifted over.

"I only said *you* could leave. I didn't say *they* could, did I?"

All three of their bodies stiffened simultaneously. Zhou Tian cursed inwardly. *Damn it, I knew it wouldn't be that simple.*

Frowning, Zhou Tian turned around and asked, "Senior Saint Devil, what do you mean by this?"

Saint Devil's eyes shone with golden light, as if suns, moons, and stars revolved within them. His voice wasn't loud, but it struck one as deafening.

"Are you questioning me? Or was what I said not clear enough?"

*Damn it, these old fogeys are really hard to deal with,* Zhou Tian thought.

"Senior Saint Devil, I don't know where these two friends of mine have offended you. I apologize on their behalf."

Mu Su and Ling Yu frantically nodded. No one wanted to die when there was a chance to live.

"They haven't offended me. It's just that I suffered a setback because of you, so I must recover my dignity elsewhere, mustn't I?" Saint Devil's tone was very calm.

*That makes so much sense, I'm speechless,* Zhou Tian was choked up. Ling Yu and Mu Su wore expressions of utter despair; this reason truly had no flaws whatsoever.

"Saint Devil, don't push your luck! If I summon a Heavenly Venerate from my Zhou family, you won't have an easy time either!" Zhou Tian spoke, borrowing prestige, hoping Saint Devil would be deterred by the Heavenly Venerate's might and back down.

"Oh? Just for these two who aren't from the Zhou family, and are remnants of the God Realm at that? If you truly cause a Heavenly Venerate to pay a heavy price to descend to the Nine Provinces from the outer reaches of the starry sky, I would indeed be hard-pressed to escape. But I'm afraid your standing in that Heavenly Venerate's heart would also be greatly diminished. You are not the only young person in the Zhou family, and a Heavenly Venerate can certainly afford to wait. This concerns your path; you should carefully weigh the pros and cons of this matter," Saint Devil said, his expression unchanged, not even putting his own life and death to heart, analyzing everything perfectly.

Zhou Tian was helpless. Since Saint Devil wasn't afraid, he had no other recourse. He couldn't actually summon a Heavenly Venerate to descend; that was just something he fabricated to deceive Saint Devil.

"You should leave first. These two are your friends after all. You wouldn't feel good if I dealt with them while you were here," Saint Devil kindly advised Zhou Tian. In his view, Zhou Tian's expression naturally arose from his unwillingness to summon a Heavenly Venerate.

Mu Su and Ling Yu were already in despair. Mu Su gave a bitter smile. "Zhou Tian, you should leave. If there's a chance, please go see my parents for me."

Mu Su did not lose his composure due to impending death, nor did he complain to Zhou Tian. Everything was his own choice; he didn't believe Zhou Tian was obligated to save them.

Ling Yu glared fiercely at Zhou Tian with her large eyes, but she didn't refute Mu Su's words. She was shrewd; from Zhou Tian's earlier action of stripping off his clothes and leaving for unknown reasons, she could infer that his resurrection method wasn't as simple as some protective means laid down by a Heavenly Venerate.

If it were that simple, Zhou Tian wouldn't need to take off his clothes and leave every so often. However, she didn't point this out.

Zhou Tian looked speechlessly at Mu Su and Ling Yu. *I haven't even given up on you two, yet you've already given up on yourselves.*

"How about this, Senior Saint Devil? You release these two, and any past grievances between you and my Zhou family arising from me will be completely wiped clean. What do you say?"
