# Chapter 359: The Empress Face-to-Face

Xu Yunfan shook his head slightly. The Diamond Indestructible Body and Marrow Cleansing Sutra of the Mituo Temple were peerless arts of the world, but the temple also cultivated the true essence of Buddhist teachings. One could make great vows to forge one's will, seeking a diamond-like spirit to attain the realm of Arhat—or as it was known in the mortal world, the Land of Immortals.

The eastward transmission of Buddhism was undoubtedly the great vow of some old master within the Mituo Temple.

The next morning, heavy clouds hung low over the capital city of Yujing, as if the very heavens were pressing down upon this millennium-old imperial city.

The Spirit Suppression Jade formation around the arena had long been shattered by the shockwaves from Xu Yunfan's intense battle two days prior. The traces of the Ministry of Works' overnight repairs were still visible, yet they could not conceal the sense of ruin left by the violent tearing.

Xu Yunfan glanced at it from afar before leaping into the depths of the Great Zhou Imperial Palace. By the time he landed on the arena platform, the green bricks beneath his feet cracked silently.

His gaze swept over the empty spectator stands. There were no ambushes from the five great sects, no iron armor of the Imperial Guard, not even a single official from the Celestial Monitoring Bureau.

Only at the far end of the arena stood a stooped figure leaning on a bone staff in the morning mist.

The imperial palace complex behind the arena, which should have been resplendent with gold and jade, was now as gloomy as a ghostly realm. The vermilion pillars were covered in withered vines, the glazed tiles were coated with bleak moss, and even the nine-step dragon-patterned imperial path, a symbol of imperial majesty, had cracked into a spiderweb of fissures.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered. He could see clearly that this decay was not the erosion of time, but the result of some sinister technique draining the life force from the earth's veins.

"Is my palace beautiful?"

A hoarse voice came from the mist.

The Empress slowly raised her head. Her white hair hung down like dried grass, and her wrinkled skin was embedded with two turbid eyeballs. Only the vermilion rouge at the corners of her lips remained, a remnant of her past ferocity.

The bright yellow dragon robe hung loosely on her body, revealing wrists that were already a grayish-green color, like dried-out corpses.

"Just you alone?"

Xu Yunfan scrutinized the Empress for a long time. He had never expected her to be a withered old woman on the verge of death, and the image of the Empress from the books of his previous life instantly shattered.

His fingertips traced the patterns on the mouth of the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace. He sensed that within a hundred zhang radius, there were indeed no other living creatures, not even a sparrow.

The bone staff slammed heavily into the ground. The Empress sneered, "Do you really think I'm a performing monkey on the street?"

Her flesh-like cheeks trembled as she spoke, as if they were about to fall off in flakes, yet she paid it no mind. "When I used this 'Swallowing Dragon Devouring Life Art' to sacrifice three hundred members of the royal family back then, your grandfather was still digging for food in the mud."

The tip of the mace scraped across the blue stone, sending out a shower of sparks. Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, his expression unchanged. "Old witch, is this all the last words you have?"

"Ignorant child, born of a lowly background, arrogant and presumptuous, knowing neither the height of heaven nor the depth of the earth!"

She stared at the gradually rippling Ten Extremities True Qi around Xu Yunfan, her turbid old eyes narrowing into slits. "You are my subject and should have become my helping hand. Now you rebel, this is treason."

"Treason?"

Xu Yunfan found it amusing. "You think highly of yourself. The world is in turmoil, and you are responsible for eighty percent of it. Eighty percent of the people have risen against you, and you are responsible for ninety percent of that."

As his words fell, the Empress suddenly launched herself forward. The purple-gold pill embedded at the top of her bone staff exploded with a blinding light. Her stooped body straightened in an instant, and a dark golden true qi surged from beneath her decaying skin, transforming into nine ferocious dragons that coiled around her.

It was the Great Zhou royal family's secret technique, the "Nine Dragons Suppressing Hell Art."

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes slightly. During his detailed conversation with Li Haomiao, the latter had mentioned that the martial art cultivated by the Empress was a supreme technique created by the founder of the Great Zhou. It was cultivated by borrowing dragon qi, and only those of royal blood, or those with the destiny of an emperor, could learn it.

The Empress's first strike tore through the air. As the bone staff fell, the nine dragon-shaped streams of true qi twisted into a torrent, and the floor tiles wherever it passed turned to dust.

Xu Yunfan raised his mace to block, the Ten Extremities True Qi surging forth powerfully, activating the Red Fire of the Swallowing Dragon Mace to clash with the dragon qi. The shockwave of the impact instantly spread out, shearing off the Spirit Suppression Jade pillars at the edge of the arena.

"Interesting."

Xu Yunfan took three steps back to dissipate the force and found that ice crystals had formed on the shaft of his mace. His gaze fell upon the bone staff in the Empress's hand. "What kind of weapon is this?"

The bone staff was clearly made from a human thigh bone, and it possessed a malevolent aura that could freeze true qi on its own.

The Empress's withered fingers slowly stroked the dark golden patterns on the surface of the bone staff, and a cold smile crept across her decaying lips. "This is the 'Heavenly Pillar Bone' of the Great Zhou's founder. When he passed into his final rest, his skeleton was more resilient than a divine weapon. Now, I am merely making full use of it."

Xu Yunfan sighed. "You are truly rebellious and heretical, digging up your own family's ancestral tomb... Oh, you seem to be a consort from an external surname?"

The Empress's attack did not stop. Staff shadows rained down like a storm, each strike accompanied by a dragon's roar. Her aging body clearly could not withstand such an outburst, and blood began to seep from her seven orifices, yet she laughed even more wildly. "Lowly commoner, do you know what a sovereign's martial art is?"

The staff wind suddenly changed in a bizarre way. The nine dark golden dragon qi streams actually devoured each other, eventually condensing into a nearly tangible紫金 (purple-gold) giant blade. This was the ultimate killing move of the "Nine Dragons Suppressing Hell Art," the "Nine-Five Annihilation," which required burning one's life force to activate.

Xu Yunfan finally changed his expression. In the nick of time, he executed the "Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall Mace Technique" to meet it head-on. The moment the mace and staff collided, the entire Black Tortoise Arena platform collapsed three zhang with a deafening roar!

In the dust and smoke, the Empress stumbled backward. The dragon robe on her chest was torn apart by the backlash of true qi, revealing a purple crystal embedded in her heart—that was precisely the Heavenly Demon Purple-Gold Pill mentioned by Dugu Jiu.

She suddenly let out a strange laugh. "Brat, do I look like those old men you drained dry?"

Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to reply and was about to press his attack when he suddenly saw a strange purple light flash in the Empress's turbid eyes.

The purple-gold pill trembled violently, and her withered body swelled like a balloon being inflated. Her white hair turned deep purple in an instant, and sharp, white barbs grew from the top of her bone staff.

"As expected..."

Xu Yunfan was already on guard, the Ten Extremities True Qi surging through his meridians like a whirlpool.

He had long seen that the Empress was no longer truly alive, relying entirely on this purple-gold pill to sustain her life. Now, she was clearly about to fight with her life on the line.

The Empress's voice was no longer human, sounding like the hissing of a thousand insects. "I would rather become a demon and drag you down with me!"

The next moment, the purple-gold pill completely exploded. Her pores sprayed out a sticky purple mist, and whatever it touched was corroded into a honeycomb-like pattern. The bone staff twisted and deformed as if it were alive, eventually transforming into a spine-sword covered in eyeball-like protrusions.

The purple mist covered half the imperial city, and the Empress's method of attack underwent a complete transformation. Each swing of the spine-sword left behind a sticky, purple-black trail.

Xu Yunfan, caught off guard, was struck in the chest. For the first time, cracks appeared on his dragon-scale armor. The purple mist was actually devouring his Ten Extremities True Qi!

"Does your Art of Sucking True Qi compare to that of the Outer Realm Demons?"

The Empress laughed maniacally. The spine-sword suddenly softened like a whip and coiled around Xu Yunfan's left arm like a venomous snake. The purple mist疯狂注入 (crazily injected) through the point of contact, and his entire arm was instantly covered in spiderweb-like purple patterns.

In this critical moment, Xu Yunfan actually curled his lips into a smile. He allowed the purple patterns to spread to his neck, but his right hand suddenly formed the sword seal of the Pure Yang Three Stances taught by Bi Yuan.
