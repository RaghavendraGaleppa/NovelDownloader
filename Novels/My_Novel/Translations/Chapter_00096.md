# Chapter 96: The Fish-Scale Armor, Reaching the Pinnacle!

In front of Li Xian were over twenty types of pills.

"Little brother, take a look for yourself."

"The effects and prices are all labeled. If you see a pill you like, just let me know," said the pill shop attendant with little enthusiasm.

Just moments ago, a woman had walked past him. He caught a whiff of her fragrance and lost a part of his soul, his heart drifting away with her.

Most of the pills sold in the market were "Secular Mixed Pills." Though they had humble names, their prices were not low.

Secular Mixed Pills had no official grade or rank. However, they still had distinctions of good, bad, superior, and inferior. The differences had to be discerned on one's own.

The Tiger Blood Pill, Deer Blood Pill, and Bear Gall Bladder Pill he had taken before were all Secular Mixed Pills. Because their ingredients were rare and expensive, they belonged to the "good" and "superior" categories.

The "Tiger Red Pill," on the other hand, was a typical "inferior" pill. Although it could help martial artists train, the pill toxins directly attacked the internal organs and damaged the body's constitution.

"Alright, you can go about your business."

Li Xian ignored the attendant's neglect.

Of the over twenty types of pills, most were for assisting martial training. There was "Continuous Qi Pill," which allowed for a continuous flow of qi, making martial training smoother. There was "Body Sensing Pill," which enhanced the body's perception.

Tiger Red Pills, Tiger Blood Pills, Bear Blood Pills... pills that could be found in the village were also present here, just at slightly higher prices.

"By the way... just what level is the Madam's alchemy skill?" Li Xian thought out of the blue.

If one spoke of preciousness and mystery, the Madam was definitely top-tier. Her martial arts attainments were unfathomable, and she was extremely skilled in alchemy, medicine boiling, and cooking.

"Right now, I urgently need pills that can directly increase my combat power," Li Xian pulled his thoughts back.

There were quite a few such pills.

"Strength Pill," which increases strength by thirty percent, with the exact effect varying from person to person. "Body Softening Pill," which makes the body soft and bones light, for greater agility...

These one-time-use pills had lower asking prices, all fluctuating around six hundred wen.

Li Xian waved his hand grandly and bought ten Strength Pills, ten Body Softening Pills, and ten Qi Prolonging Pills.

Then he went to the black market to buy poison powder, gunpowder, darts, and other items.

The black market was crowded and complicated. Before entering, Li Xian deliberately smeared some wall ash on his face.

Aside from losing more than he won when haggling with people, the process went smoothly.

"Wow, over thirty taels of silver gone in one go."

By evening, Li Xian figured he had bought everything he needed. He touched the pocket in his chest; the money had decreased by more than half. It would be a lie to say he didn't feel any heartache.

Just as he was about to leave, his gaze fell on a small stall to his right. The stall was deserted, with only one item on display.

"How much for this thing?" Li Xian bent down and picked it up, examining it from all sides.

It was a fish-scale chest plate. The material was soft and the craftsmanship was fine, though it was a bit damaged.

"Ten taels."

The seller was a woman. Half of her face was burned, hideous and terrifying, but the other half had fair skin and proud, heroic eyebrows.

"Can it be cheaper?" Li Xian really liked it. He gently compared it to his chest; the size was a bit small, but the chest plate had elasticity and could fit his body well.

"Ten taels, take it or leave it."

The woman let out a cold laugh. If she couldn't even sell it for ten taels, it would be a great insult to her dignity. Though she was down on her luck and had to sell her chest plate, she couldn't lose this air of hers.

Ten taels... not a single coin less!

Li Xian gritted his teeth. "Fine, ten taels it is!" He took out the money, paying one hand and receiving the goods with the other.

This "fish-scale chest plate" looked simple and unadorned, but when Li Xian's palm stroked over it, a cool sensation returned, showing that the material was special. And the links of the chest plate, the arrangement of the scales...

The craftsmanship within was truly tremendous.

Those coming and going in the black market—martial artists, commoners, merchants—many of whom came from wealthy families, were all locals of the county. None of them could see the exquisiteness of this item.

Li Xian, relying on the knowledge of two lifetimes, was able to see the subtleties. He now had a premonition that this armor... shouldn't have appeared in this county.

Ten taels of silver, an absolute steal!

"You have a good eye. I've let you have it cheap," the woman spat out, took the silver, and turned to walk out of the black market. She was tall and valiant; she probably wasn't a local either.

"She's quite a character," Li Xian rubbed the chest plate, feeling more and more satisfied. The ten taels were not unjustified. He put the chest plate on, close to his skin.

It felt as if a layer of fish scales had been attached to his chest.

The chest plate was very thin. If he wrapped another layer of clothing over it, no one would be able to tell at all.

Li Xian thought to himself: "Today's Ziyun County is truly full of hidden dragons and tigers, quite exciting."

First, there was the noble woman seeking pills, then the disfigured guest selling armor.

But these various storms and clouds had nothing to do with him, this insignificant mud-sculpted figure.

At the Mountain Wind Pass, beside a river.

The ceaseless river flowed, driving a wooden waterwheel. The water followed a channel, flowing into a reservoir deep in the forest.

Nearby was a mountain cave.

Inside the cave stood a half-person-tall black cauldron. The fire beneath it burned fiercely, and the soup inside boiled rapidly, evaporating quickly and requiring constant replenishment.

"Hmm, a letter?"

The leader of the Mountain Wind Stronghold, Ma Daozi, had a ferocious scar on his left cheek. He was burly and carried two short swords under his arms.

A carrier pigeon flew over.

He picked up a pebble and flicked it gently, knocking the pigeon to the ground. He opened the envelope and saw it was a letter from his third brother, Peng Huli.

After reading the contents, Ma Daozi frowned. "Second brother, fifth brother, take a look," and handed the letter to the two of them.

Ma Daozi had been a wandering bladesman in his early years. He fled everywhere, with no fixed abode, and had no intention of settling down. One day, passing through this area, he had a great encounter and discovered a treasure cauldron in a cave.

要知道武人……脱胎换骨的武人，能够自立门户的标志，便是具备一尊“鼎”。有鼎，才能熬煮像样精宝。且这尊宝鼎，距离河脉不远。这更属于“宝地”！鼎物厚沉，连通地气，能不挪动最好。且一些古朴的鼎，与地气纠缠，宛若吸在地上。即便是脱胎换骨的武人，也难以将其扛起。此等机缘，麻刀子着实不愿浪费，故而落草为寇。在远处一座险山，建立起山寨，积累实力。若有“精食”，便在此处秘密烹煮。唯有山寨心腹，知晓此处所在。

A martial artist... a martial artist who has undergone a complete transformation, the sign of being able to establish one's own sect is possessing a "cauldron." With a cauldron, one can boil proper fine treasures. Moreover, this treasure cauldron was not far from the river. This was even more of a "treasure land!" Cauldrons are heavy and thick, connecting with the earth's energy, so it's best not to move them. And some ancient cauldrons are entangled with the earth's energy, as if glued to the ground. Even a martial artist who has undergone a complete transformation would have difficulty lifting it. Such an opportunity, Ma Daozi was truly unwilling to waste, so he became an outlaw. He established a stronghold on a treacherous mountain in the distance, accumulating strength. If he had "fine food," he would boil it secretly here. Only the close confidants of the stronghold knew of this location.

"An guard from the One Unity Manor?" Second Leader Hong Kai frowned after reading the letter.

"What's wrong with Third Brother? How could he not even deal with a single guard and need me to go back and help?" Fifth Leader Lu Xuefeng said displeased.

The fine food was about to be boiled; he didn't want to leave. If he stayed, he might get an extra sip of soup.

Ma Daozi said, "Since there's a situation at the stronghold, fifth brother, you can go back and take a look. If you can solve it, just do it on your way."

"We're using smokeless charcoal here. This charcoal doesn't produce smoke, but its heat is weak. It might not be possible to boil the soup in the next half month."

"If you go there and back, there should be enough time. Don't worry, this mouthful of fine soup and fine meat, you won't miss out on it."

Lu Xuefeng said joyfully, "Since Big Brother has spoken, I'll go back right away."

He set off immediately.

Because the Mountain Wind Pass was a secret location and close to the river, there was no need for manpower to transport water. The three of them came here without riding horses to reduce commotion. Therefore, he had to walk back.

Hong Kai watched Lu Xuefeng's back and said with envy, "Big Brother, fifth brother's talent is truly unmatched. If he were in another place, would he be considered a genius?"

"He is also someone favored by heaven," Ma Daozi said with a hint of jealousy. "But if you talk about a genius, heh, he's far from it."

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]

Martial arts come from hardship, strength is born from tempering. The more urgent and crisis-filled the situation, the calmer one must be.

Li Xian cultivated several martial arts simultaneously. The Breeze Leg had already reached "Perfection," and the Four Directions Fist was nearing "Pinnacle."

He was just over a thousand proficiency points away.

If he just stood on his tiptoes a bit more, he could touch it.

So he stayed up late and trained hard...

*Bang!*

In an instant, Li Xian's whole body trembled. Qi and blood surged up and down. Naturally, the pores all over his body closed completely, and his blood solidified.

After "Qi Circulating Through the Body," "Solidifying Blood and Closing Pores" was finally fully cultivated!

"If I were to boil fine food now, the effects would be even better!"

For a mortal mud-sculpted body, achieving "Qi Circulating Through the Body" and "Solidifying Blood and Closing Pores" is already the limit.

At this time, his internal qi was vigorous, his blood qi was locked within his body, his breath was long and continuous, his energy was abundant, his whole body was light, his bones were tough and his tendons were strong.

All these things...

How could ordinary people who don't practice martial arts resist them?

Li Xian ate and drank beast matter, making his bones and muscles even stronger than ordinary people.

To go a step further, he would need to eat "fine treasures," subtly shedding his mortal shell and stepping into the realm of "eating the fine."

Li Xian did not rest. Taking advantage of his strong physical body, he threw punch after punch. His punches were powerful and profound, grasping the spiritual light in his heart.

His body's blood sometimes slow, sometimes fast...

Using blood as a medium to transport internal qi. When the blood was fast, the qi was like a fierce river crashing down. When the blood was slow, the qi was like a spring breeze brushing the ground.

Although "Solidifying Blood and Closing Pores" was for "retaining essence" and "digesting fine treasures," it was also extremely useful when used in martial combat.

It was relaxed and controlled.

If one could use it skillfully, even a common martial art, a common move, or even the simplest straight punch, when it came flying at you, it would be difficult to defend against.

[You have comprehended the principle of blood flow, which complements the fist technique, and its power has been raised to a higher level.]
[Proficiency +21]

The Four Directions Fist was created by the Madam.

Its original intention was a simple "feint left, strike right" and "point left, hit right," as well as how to skillfully resolve and escape from danger when surrounded on all sides.

It was outwardly square but inwardly round, ordinary and plain, fierce yet not without flexibility.

As he practiced to a higher level, the principle of the fist's changes became deeper...

And at this moment, Li Xian added the changes of relaxation and tension, slowness and speed, to the principle of changes.

This caused a qualitative change, adding a thousand and a hundred changes out of thin air.

[Proficiency +10]

Taking advantage of the countless spiritual lights popping up, Li Xian seized the moment and threw punch after punch.

Heaven's way rewards diligence. His fist technique attainments grew deeper and deeper.

In a daze, Li Xian remembered the time when he was pulling weeds in a dilapidated house, staying up late to train hard, just to use the fists in his hands to smash out a chance to change his fate.

Times and circumstances had changed.

The only thing Li Xian could still rely on was still the fists in his hands.

But this time...

His breath was long and continuous. Even if he stayed up late practicing his fists, he wouldn't feel sleepy.

"My martial intent is pure. Punch, and punch again!"

The night passed.

Li Xian's whole body was steaming with heat, generated from within his body. He didn't dare to close his pores to lock it in, otherwise he would burn his own body.

It had been snowing lightly last night.

But in the courtyard, there was not a single snowflake to be seen, only a field of water.

Li Xian was drenched, already unable to tell if it was sweat or melted snow.

Just as his last punch was thrown, a sharp light flashed in his eyes. In that instant, all the muscles and bones in his body twitched, and a strange *bang* sound came from within him.
