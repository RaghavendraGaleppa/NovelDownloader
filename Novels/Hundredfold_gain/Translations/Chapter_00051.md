# Chapter 51: Earning Spirit Stones Through Talisman Crafting, Qi Chuan's Arrogance

Looking at the innocent yet expectant face of the burly middle-aged rogue cultivator, who had just pulled out a stack of "First-Grade Talisman Crafting Techniques" from behind him, Qi Chuan couldn't help but feel speechless inside.

"So this is what you call 'First-Grade Talisman Crafting Techniques'... just one low-grade spirit stone per copy..."

Originally, he had thought these techniques would be something extraordinary.

But then again, most first-grade talisman masters didn't know how to craft every type of first-grade talisman. While first-grade talismans were all used at the Qi Refinement stage, they covered a wide range of types and varieties. Many talisman masters only knew how to craft a small portion of them.

The burly rogue cultivator before him, though only capable of crafting talismans related to the basic Five Elements spells, could still barely be considered a low-grade first-grade talisman master. Therefore, the crafting methods and experience he had compiled could technically be called "first-grade talisman techniques"—they just fell far short of Qi Chuan's expectations.

"How about buying a few more copies? I can give you a 20% discount," the burly rogue cultivator said eagerly, his eyes gleaming as he looked at Qi Chuan.

"No, thank you," Qi Chuan replied with a slight shake of his head.

The cultivator's eyes dimmed with disappointment.

"Still, at just one low-grade spirit stone per copy, maybe I should buy one and try my hand at talisman crafting?" Qi Chuan mused.

After all, with his hundredfold amplification ability, pursuing talisman crafting was definitely feasible. Even if these "First-Grade Talisman Crafting Techniques" only covered the five most basic talismans, they could serve as a stepping stone into the world of talisman crafting.

Moreover, talismans like Fireball and Water Arrow, which the burly cultivator could only craft at low-grade first-grade quality, weren't worth much. But in Qi Chuan's hands, they would be different.

His mastery of the basic Five Elements spells had long reached the Great Perfection stage, and a talisman master's proficiency in the relevant spells naturally enhanced their crafting. For example, two talisman masters of the same skill level crafting Fireball Talismans—one with only basic proficiency in the Fireball spell and the other with Perfect mastery—would produce talismans of vastly different quality.

And with his hundredfold amplification, Qi Chuan could continuously improve his talisman-crafting skills. This meant that even with the most basic talismans like Fireball, he could craft high-grade or even top-grade first-grade talismans.

Low-grade Fireball Talismans were cheap, but high-grade and top-grade ones were extremely valuable.

"Right now, I need a large number of spirit stones to cultivate the second and third layers of the Minor Mystic Jade Body and to purchase Essence-Gathering Pills to aid my mana refinement. Though I have a small amount saved up, it won't last long."

"I could raise my talisman-crafting skills and produce a large number of high-grade and top-grade Fireball Talismans to sell for spirit stones, funding my cultivation."

With this in mind, Qi Chuan found the one-spirit-stone "First-Grade Talisman Crafting Techniques" quite practical.

"Fine, I'll take one."

He handed over a low-grade spirit stone to the burly rogue cultivator.

"Wonderful! Thank you!" The cultivator's eyes lit up as he eagerly passed over a copy of the techniques, as if afraid Qi Chuan might change his mind. "Here, let me give you a few extra talismans as well."

He grabbed one of each of the five basic elemental talismans from his stall and offered them to Qi Chuan.

"...No need, thanks," Qi Chuan said after a brief pause, glancing at the crudely made low-grade talismans before shaking his head. These talismans were too weak to be of any use to him.

After storing the crafting techniques, Qi Chuan turned and left the valley market without hesitation.

"What a wealthy cultivator, turning down free talismans like that," the burly rogue cultivator muttered to himself as he watched Qi Chuan depart.

---

Qi Chuan used the Levitation spell to fly out of the valley market, but after leaving the hilly area surrounding it, he canceled the spell and landed. Maintaining Levitation consumed a significant amount of mana, and at the Qi Refinement stage, most cultivators conserved their mana carefully. If he kept flying, he might exhaust his mana before even returning to the Moonlit Breeze Sect.

Once on the ground, Qi Chuan scanned his surroundings and set off toward the sect at a brisk walking pace. Even on foot, cultivators moved much faster than ordinary people.

However, as he walked, Qi Chuan's brow furrowed slightly. He glanced back, sensing an unfamiliar presence—another cultivator using an Invisibility spell, trailing him.

"Trouble already, just from visiting the market?" Qi Chuan sighed inwardly. "Is it someone from the Clear Breeze Pavilion, that rogue cultivator who sold me the techniques, or someone else from the market?"

He couldn't tell who the bandit was, so he simply picked up his pace. Yet, as he did, the hidden pursuer matched his speed, refusing to give up.

"Am I being too low-key?" Qi Chuan sighed again and stopped walking. The bandit's aura wasn't strong—just an ordinary third-layer Qi Refinement cultivator. How dare such a weakling target him?

He turned around and said calmly, "Come out. I know you're there."

"Heh... Since you've noticed, I won't hide anymore." A rough voice answered.

From the seemingly empty air nearby, a burly figure gradually materialized—none other than the rogue cultivator who had sold Qi Chuan the talisman techniques earlier.

"You?" Qi Chuan said, his expression unreadable. "So you sell talismans by day and rob people by night."

The cultivator grinned. "Selling cheap, low-grade talismans doesn't pay as well as banditry. You wouldn't even take the free ones I offered—must be loaded. Hand over your spirit stones, and I'll make your death quick."

He pulled out a stack of Fireball Talismans in one hand and Water Arrow Talismans in the other, eyeing Qi Chuan greedily. In his mind, someone so young couldn't possibly be strong. With his talismans and third-layer Qi Refinement cultivation, this should be an easy job.

Qi Chuan had no words. He realized he had been too reserved, making this fool underestimate him.

"In the world of cultivation, if you have strength, you should flaunt it. No need to be humble before ants."

With that thought, a faint jade glow began to spread across Qi Chuan's skin, soon covering his entire body. Under the radiant light, he looked like a statue of jade, exuding an air of majesty.

His eyes gleamed with the same jade light as he locked onto the rogue cultivator. With a slight bend of his knees, Qi Chuan exploded forward, the ground cracking beneath him as he shot toward his target like a streak of jade lightning.
