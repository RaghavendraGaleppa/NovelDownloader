# Chapter 68: Corpses of Gods Everywhere! The Mad Human Immortal!

Ahead, sinister energy surged violently.

Behind them, Human Immortals clashed in battle, their battlefield shifting closer.

Now trapped between the two, unable to advance or retreat, they had barely spotted the glow of righteous aura and sought refuge with a powerful figure when the Hanging Bird's shout caused that senior to withdraw his power.

"Would it kill you not to shout?" The Five Elements Creation Tree extended its roots, waving them angrily. "Now that you've shouted, he's run off, and we might die!"

"If he had no intention of protecting us, shouting or not wouldn't have changed the outcome."

Li Zhengjing's expression was grave. "Let's continue in the direction we saw earlier. Things can't get worse than they are now!"

He glanced at the golden page's fortune-telling and confirmed that proceeding wouldn't endanger their lives. After advancing another ten miles, they discovered a half-collapsed temple.

After a moment's hesitation, he stepped over the broken walls and entered the temple.

The temple wasn't large, but judging by the damaged murals, broken pillars, and scattered bricks, it was clear that it had once been meticulously crafted.

With one hand on the hilt of the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, he peered inside.

The altar was empty, with shattered stones littering the floor.

"Master, there's nothing here," the Hanging Bird said, poking its head out.

"Though this temple is in ruins, the fact that it remains standing in the northern lands suggests it might hold something extraordinary," Li Zhengjing mused.

"Master... look at the stones on the ground..." The Five Elements Creation Tree crawled out of the Parasol Wood Box. "These are divine corpses."

"Divine corpses?"

Li Zhengjing's expression shifted. He examined the stones closely, but the golden page showed no reaction, deepening his frown.

The Hanging Bird flew down and inspected the area but found nothing unusual.

"Aren't these just ordinary rocks?"

"They're Celestial Domain Divine Stones, used to carve divine statues."

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches. "In the Southern Barrens, many such statues exist. Carved from heavenly stones, they can manifest miracles when worshipped sincerely!"

It continued, "I've seen many in the Southern Barrens. Statues that can manifest are true gods! But here, the statue is shattered—the god must be dead. These stones are its broken remains..."

The Hanging Bird shuddered. "You make a pile of rocks sound terrifying."

Li Zhengjing sensed something odd. Picking up a stone, he found it strangely familiar.

After a moment, he retrieved the jade fragment left by Yuan Zhengfeng from the Parasol Wood Box.

One was a broken jade, the other a shattered stone.

Li Zhengjing felt an uncanny similarity between them, though he couldn't quite articulate it. The jade pulsed with vitality, while the stone was utterly lifeless, no different from ordinary rock.

"Are these truly the remains of a god?"

"Was the righteous aura we saw earlier emitted from these stones?"

"Let's take a couple for later study."

After confirming with the golden page that doing so wouldn't bring danger, he pocketed two stones along with the jade fragment.

He studied the scattered stones, then turned to the Five Elements Creation Tree. "The first Heavenly Venerable of Ten Thousand Calamities confirmed that ascension was a lie—that there were no true immortals beyond the Nine Heavens. That's why he sought to build the Golden Ship of Salvation. If gods truly exist, why did the Heavenly Venerables and their followers insist that 'there are no true immortals beyond the Nine Heavens'?"

"I wouldn't know about that..." The tree waved its branches. "But from what I saw in the Southern Barrens, these gods aren't immortal either. They wage war over tribal conflicts, and when killed, their remains turn into lifeless stones—what we call divine corpses."

It seemed to recall something and added, "When I was a hundred years old, a god named 'Great True Heaven' died of old age!"

"Before his death, a Human Immortal from the Central Plains visited, seeking his intact 'divine body.' But they couldn't agree, so the Human Immortal slaughtered twelve tribes that worshipped Great True Heaven in a rage."

The Five Elements Creation Tree sighed. "Then he and Great True Heaven wounded each other badly. Forced to flee the Southern Barrens, he ran into me on his way back..."

The Hanging Bird suddenly understood. "So that Human Immortal was your first master, the one you doomed?"

"Don't slander me!" The tree lashed its roots. "He died before reaching the Central Plains—he never even ate me! The one who killed him while he was weakened was my first true master!"

Ignoring the bickering, Li Zhengjing pondered.

These so-called gods were bound by lifespan and could die of old age?

From the tree's account, they seemed to be beings who had transcended mortality through a different path, roughly equivalent to Human Immortals.

He looked at the stones, realizing they weren't the celestial deities he had imagined. But why had that Human Immortal sought an intact "divine body"?

"Master, look! There's writing here!"

The Hanging Bird's divine eyes spotted inscriptions on the altar.

The altar stood half a zhang tall, with the text carved at its base—only visible from above.

Li Zhengjing approached, followed by the bird and the tree.

"Hanging Bird," Li Zhengjing suddenly said.

"Master?" The bird seemed to guess his intent, avoiding his gaze.

"These characters are archaic. You're well-read—can you decipher them?"

"...To be honest, Master, though I've studied many texts, they were all printed during the Great Zhou Dynasty. I can't read these ancient scripts."

"I can!"

Another head suddenly squeezed in, peering intently at the inscriptions.

The atmosphere froze.

Man, bird, and tree turned stiffly to the left.

There, a disheveled, ragged old man gnawed his fingernails, looking troubled.

He turned to them.

Silence.

"Before we read this... I have a question," the odd man said, scratching his head. "Recently, a freakish bastard said he'd cure my madness and make me normal."

"Do you think, under current laws, that counts as violating my right to be insane?"

He looked at them earnestly. "Can I sue him in the capital and have him beheaded?"

Another long silence.

Finally, the Hanging Bird spoke, trembling.

"Given your question... the lawsuit probably won't succeed."

"Why not?" The old man scowled.

"From the sound of it, he didn't actually cure you," the bird whispered. "At most, it's attempted violation."

"So I let him stick me with needles for nothing? And he wanted to split my skull open! The monster!"

The old man grew furious, his aura shaking the temple.

A white light emanated from him—the same righteous aura Li Zhengjing had seen earlier!

"Senior, don't worry! This bird is a scholar of great learning, capable of turning black into white," Li Zhengjing declared. "Whether that bastard succeeded or not, we'll have the bird draft a complaint. Once submitted to the capital, he'll be sentenced to death by a thousand cuts—36,500 slices, without anesthesia!"
