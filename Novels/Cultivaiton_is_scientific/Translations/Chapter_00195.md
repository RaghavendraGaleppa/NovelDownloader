# Chapter 195: Passing Through

Jieshan City was built about two hundred miles from the defensive formation of the Senluo Sect. As Li Shiming entered the city, he immediately noticed something different about it.

This wasn't an ordinary mortal city. Upon entering, he sensed the spiritual fluctuations of many cultivators. It was a mixed city where mortals and cultivators coexisted. He saw many shops run by cultivators, with mortals bustling about inside.

This situation was extremely rare because mortals couldn't withstand overly concentrated spiritual energy, making it nearly impossible for them to stay in cultivator shops for long. However, the spiritual energy fluctuations in the shops here were very weak, suggesting they didn't engage in deep processing of spiritual materials.

As Li Shiming walked, he searched for Shengmao Shop, a store affiliated with the Shushan Sect.

"Found it!" It didn't take long to locate his target, mainly because the shop was too conspicuous—one of the largest in Jieshan City.

At Shengmao Shop, large carts were unloading numerous crates with faint spiritual energy fluctuations, which were then carried into the shop.

"Shop assistant, I need to see your manager!" Li Shiming approached and stopped a busy mortal assistant.

"Please wait a moment, I'll inform him right away!" The mortal assistant glanced at Li Shiming, taking in his robe and the storage pouch at his waist, then bowed respectfully. The mortals here had methods to identify cultivators—simple but effective. Mortals were extremely deferential to cultivators, given the vast gap between them. A cultivator could decide a mortal's life or death with a mere thought.

"Fellow Daoist, you were looking for me?" An elderly cultivator at the mid Foundation Building stage slowly emerged from the shop. Upon seeing Li Shiming, he paused slightly, sensing Li Shiming's cultivation level.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist. I need to leave the Ten Thousand Mountains. Here's my token." Li Shiming produced the jade token Xu Chuan had given him, bearing the mark of the Shushan Sect.

The elderly cultivator touched the token lightly with his finger, revealing a faint mark—the insignia of a true disciple. His eyes narrowed slightly. He knew exactly whose token this was. Xu Chuan had recently used this channel to enter the Ten Thousand Mountains, a fact well-known to him as the overseer of this passage.

With Li Shiming presenting Xu Chuan's token, it was clear Xu Chuan had authorized his passage. True disciples had the authority to mobilize this channel, and with the token as proof, the passage had to be opened for Li Shiming.

"Fellow Daoist, I must inform you that the next shipment won't depart for another three days. You'll need to wait here until then. Also, the method of getting you across the border is somewhat... unique. Please bear with it," the elderly cultivator said softly.

"Thank you for your help. I'll follow your arrangements," Li Shiming replied without complaint, bowing in gratitude.

"Xiao Wu, take this guest to a guest room," the elderly cultivator instructed a mortal assistant.

The assistant led Li Shiming to the backyard and showed him to a guest room. There was no spiritual vein or any spiritual materials—everything was purely mundane.

Li Shiming sighed inwardly. Traveling outside made cultivation difficult, a significant inconvenience. He'd been away for too long, and his spiritual power had barely increased. Without the Monkey Wine accelerating his body-refining techniques, his progress would have stagnated entirely.

Cultivation required a stable environment for long-term practice. He began considering whether to join the Thousand Illusions Sect or the Shushan Sect. However, being in the Ten Thousand Mountains, he knew little about either. He decided to wait until he left before making a decision.

The Thousand Illusions Sect had Yin Shiran, which would at least guarantee him a position as an ordinary disciple. But relying entirely on her protection would earn him disdain from fellow sect members—and himself. If he joined the Shushan Sect, the gratitude for bringing the third-grade Muyang Three-Leaf Grass would likely earn him favor and protection from Xu Chuan's master. However, he'd also inherit Xu Chuan's enemies.

Li Shiming wasn't foolish. When he rescued Xu Chuan, he'd noticed something amiss—Xu Chuan had been betrayed. Otherwise, how could the ambush have been so precise? With Xu Chuan's combat prowess, he could have easily killed two or three cultivators of the same level, and with his hidden means, even surpassing his level wasn't out of the question. Yet, he'd nearly died in an ambush by three peers, with another mid Foundation Building cultivator merely serving as a distraction.

Joining Xu Chuan's faction would bring benefits but also corresponding troubles. Of course, the specifics of the two sects were what mattered most.

For three days, Li Shiming focused on body refinement until a shop assistant came to notify him.

In the backyard, he saw twenty large carts, each pulled by two tall, robust black oxen. The carts were nearly as large as trucks from his previous life, requiring such strong oxen to move them effortlessly. The oxen had faint spiritual energy fluctuations—traces of spiritual beast bloodline, granting them strength far beyond ordinary beasts.

"Fellow Daoist, come with me," the elderly manager beckoned upon seeing Li Shiming. Neither exchanged names, as Xu Chuan had advised, wary of leaks within the channel—not about Li Shiming's passage, but about Xu Chuan's information being leaked to the Senluo Sect.

Li Shiming was cautious, even disguising his appearance.

"Please sit inside here. Stay silent. The cart will take you out of the Ten Thousand Mountains. In about seven hours, you can emerge," the manager said, opening a side panel of one cart.

Inside, Li Shiming found a hidden compartment at the bottom, just large enough for one person. Though the space was lined with materials to isolate spiritual energy, he doubted such a simple method could bypass inspections. Any experienced cultivator could easily detect hidden passengers.

"Don't worry. We've used this method to transport cultivators for years without incident. Other sect-affiliated shops in the city use the same method to move in and out of the Ten Thousand Mountains," the manager explained, sensing Li Shiming's hesitation.

Through the manager's explanation, Li Shiming understood the rationale. Major sects needed to trade with the Senluo Sect, a mutual necessity. Instead of forcing sects to breach the formation, the Senluo Sect allowed this controlled passage. Only Foundation Building and Qi Refining cultivators used this method—Golden Core cultivators would find it beneath their dignity.

The cramped space limited the number of passengers per trip, preventing mass crossings. In reality, the Senluo Sect's checkpoint guards were aware of these crossings. It was an open secret, maintaining the facade while ensuring trade routes remained open.

The Ten Thousand Mountains' resources needed exchange with those from other sects' territories, a mutual benefit. The Senluo Sect also sometimes sent disciples out on missions, requiring such channels.

The cart moved slowly but steadily. Initially, Li Shiming worried about inspections at the checkpoint two hundred miles away, but the cart never stopped, not even for checks. He began to trust the manager's words—this channel was indeed safe.

Leaving the Ten Thousand Mountains took time due to winding mountain paths, extending the distance manyfold.

Seven hours later, someone tapped the side panel, signaling Li Shiming to emerge. The cart continued moving, its workers ignoring him as if he didn't exist. He found himself on a plain, the Ten Thousand Mountains visible in the distance.

He wanted to ask questions but held back, sensing the workers' adherence to unspoken rules. Behind him, at the border, the auras of two Golden Core cultivators loomed, their presence a deterrent to any unauthorized passage.

With no knowledge of his surroundings, Li Shiming didn't linger. Transforming into a sword light, he flew hundreds of miles until he found a city. Assuming cities would have cultivators, he disguised himself as a young scholar and entered.

Using his spiritual sense, he scanned the city but found no traces of cultivators. Even the mortals' conversations never mentioned them—unlike in the Ten Thousand Mountains, where cultivator legends were commonplace.

He purchased a map and some books, learning he was in the Tang Kingdom, one of many on the Northern Shu Continent, with 260 cities. Moving to another city, he again found no cultivators.

This mirrored the Heavenly Sea Sect's management of mortals—most knew nothing of cultivators, and the spiritual energy was deliberately kept thin to protect mortals' health.

Without a cultivator's map, finding his way became troublesome. The Tang Kingdom's vast size made random searches impractical. He decided to head for the capital, where sect representatives were sure to be stationed.

"If only I'd asked Xu Chuan for a map," Li Shiming mused as he flew toward the capital. Xu Chuan likely hadn't anticipated this—most cultivators knew the major sects' locations. But Li Shiming had stumbled into the mortal world, unable to find a single cultivator.

In truth, he'd taken the wrong path. Those familiar with the route would have headed in the opposite direction—toward the cultivators' world.

Fortunately, his speed allowed him to reach the capital by evening. Using his invisibility technique, he entered the city. Near the imperial palace at the center, he smiled. Major sects' management of mortal kingdoms was consistent, whether on Heavenly Sea Island or the Northern Shu Continent—except for the Senluo Sect, which mixed mortals and cultivators freely.
