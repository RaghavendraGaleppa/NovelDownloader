# Chapter 5: Breaking Through the Bottleneck  

"Fellow Daoist, could you lower the price for this Clear Spirit Wine?" Wei Qian seized the opportunity to bargain.  

The burly man, built like an iron tower, shook his head vigorously like a rattle-drum: "This Clear Spirit Wine of mine is brewed with a secret method—excellent in taste, and with prolonged consumption, it can even slightly enhance one's spiritual power. Selling it cheap would be a waste!"  

"Look at how the Wang family's commotion has driven away your customers," Wei Qian countered. "If you lower the price, I'll buy more. In the end, you'll still profit."  

The cultivator surnamed Shen remained stubborn.  

But Wei Qian was a rogue cultivator by origin. After a brief exchange, he immediately sensed that the man's resolve was wavering.  

That was enough.  

Wei Qian didn’t press further. Instead, he turned and walked away, heading to other stalls.  

At this moment, Li Caiwei finished her conversation with the two Li family cultivators and approached Wei Qian apologetically. "My father wants to see me, so I must—"  

Before she could finish, Wei Qian waved her off. "Don’t worry about me, Young Miss. Go ahead. I’ll look around on my own."  

Li Caiwei apologized once more before hurrying off.  

Left to his own devices, Wei Qian wandered leisurely through the trade fair.  

Pills, magical artifacts, spirit beasts, medicinal herbs, ores... Wei Qian saw many things that piqued his interest, but with his meager funds, he left empty-handed after a full round.  

The trade fair lasted three days.  

Over the next two days, Wei Qian returned frequently, especially lingering around the stall of the cultivator surnamed Shen.  

Perhaps due to the disturbance on the first day, business at Shen’s stall remained sluggish.  

Finally, on the afternoon of the third day—just as the trade fair was winding down—Shen called out to Wei Qian as he "passed by" yet again.  

Lowering his voice, he transmitted his words secretly: "I’ve got five jars left. Originally priced at ten spirit stones, but I’ll sell them to you for eight."  

A faint smile flickered across Wei Qian’s face before he suppressed it. "Seven spirit stones! And I’ll buy from you again at future trade fairs."  

"You can’t haggle like that!" Shen’s voice carried a hint of irritation.  

After a spirited back-and-forth, Wei Qian emerged victorious.  

With just seven low-grade spirit stones, he walked away with five jars of Clear Spirit Wine.  

During the exchange, Shen looked as though his heart was bleeding, gritting his teeth in pain, while Wei Qian grinned cheerfully, waving as he left with a promise to return as a "repeat customer."  

---  

With the three-day trade fair concluded, Wei Qian’s life returned to its usual rhythm.  

On a new morning, as Old Man Li strolled through the spirit fields to inspect the growth of the Jade Crystal Rice, his nose twitched at an intoxicating aroma of wine.  

"Hmm?" His craving piqued, Old Man Li followed the scent a few steps further.  

Seeing him approach, Wei Qian smiled and shook a gourd in his hand.  

"Old man, care for a drink?"  

"Ah, you rascal, this is spirit wine, isn’t it?" Old Man Li strode over but didn’t take the gourd.  

"They say no one visits without a purpose. What are you up to, boy?"  

Wei Qian tossed the gourd over. Once Old Man Li caught it, he replied, "You took me in back then. Isn’t it only right for me to show my gratitude now?"  

After a few more exchanges, confirming that Wei Qian truly had no ulterior motive, Old Man Li finally took a hearty swig.  

He took a deep sip, exhaled slowly, and sighed in appreciation. "Truly fine wine! Full of character!"  

That sip of spirit wine loosened Old Man Li’s tongue, and the two soon grew genuinely close. Within days, they were like old friends despite their age difference.  

Still, their conversations mostly revolved around mundane matters—occasionally touching on the situation around Misty Ridge Mountain—but never broaching the topic Wei Qian most wanted to discuss: the art of spirit farming.  

Wei Qian remained patient. Aside from his tenant duties, he devoted himself to cultivation. A month later, he felt himself hitting a stagnation period at the second level of Qi Refining.  

Despite maintaining the same rigorous practice, his spiritual power’s growth had slowed significantly.  

For the past four years, Wei Qian’s poor aptitude and lack of a proper cultivation site had kept him stuck at the first level of Qi Refining.  

"To break through this stagnation, I can either keep grinding it out slowly or rely on elixirs to force a breakthrough."  

"But pills that enhance spiritual power don’t come cheap... Of course, endless meditation isn’t ideal either."  

Wei Qian halted his practice, focusing his mind as his consciousness sank into his spiritual sea.  

"Dragon Pearl, I wish to smoothly break through the bottleneck at the second level of Qi Refining."  

Instantly, he knew the cost—five days!  

For these five days, Wei Qian granted himself a rare break.  

He practiced only two hours daily, spending the rest of his time exploring every accessible corner of Misty Ridge Mountain.  

---  

He also stumbled upon an unexpected gain—befriending a Li family cultivator, none other than Li Guchen, the one who had stood up for the young mistress during the confrontation with Wang Quan at the trade fair.  

Li Guchen was three years older than Wei Qian and at the fifth level of Qi Refining.  

His personality was restless, lacking the patience for prolonged meditation.  

Otherwise, given the resources available to him, reaching the late stages of Qi Refining would have been well within his grasp.  

After all, his father was the elder in charge of the Li family’s spirit herb garden! A mere trickle from his fingertips could match a rogue cultivator’s lifetime savings.  

Li Guchen was an interesting character. Despite Wei Qian’s lower cultivation level, he never looked down on him.  

On the contrary, Li Guchen loved listening to Wei Qian’s tales of his rogue cultivator days and the various experiences in the cultivation world.  

It turned out this man secretly harbored dreams of being a rogue cultivator.  

In his mind, rogue cultivators were like those in travelogues and legends—blessed by fate, stumbling upon beauties and treasures wherever they went, slaying foes with a swing of their sword, roaming the world with pride.  

"Perhaps this is the nature of walls—those outside long to get in, while those inside envy those outside."  

Indeed, Wei Qian acknowledged that across the vast expanse of the cultivation world and its long history, there were rogue cultivators who seemed chosen by heaven itself. But how likely was that?  

At the very least, Wei Qian knew he wasn’t one of them.  

He lacked the heaven-defying luck to crush all obstacles in his path. So, steady cultivation it was.  

Step by step, covering a thousand miles; drop by drop, forming rivers and seas.  

On the morning of the fifth day, as he made his final wish, the bottleneck that had plagued Wei Qian quietly dissolved.
