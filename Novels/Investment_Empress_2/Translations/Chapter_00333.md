# Chapter 333: The Celestial Mirror of Truth, All Beings in a Dream (1/2)

Under the flickering lamplight, a green pill appeared within a stone box, its divine nature sealed by the System to prevent any leakage.

The pill was no larger than a thumb, resembling a lotus seed freshly plucked from its pod, vibrant and jade-green.

**[Life-Prolonging Pill]:** *“Top-grade Treasure Pill. Formed over a thousand years using the Seed Refining Method, it contains a trace of the Dao of Longevity. It can forcibly increase the user’s Life Wheel, extending their lifespan by sixty years. Only one can be consumed.”*

Everyone knew that Little Li had a certain talent for the Dao of Alchemy.

That was why the other alchemy master, Elder Xue, often regretted not kicking a disciple out of his own sect back then to guide Little Li onto the path of alchemy.

Perhaps feeling it was a great pity, Elder Xue often subtly imparted alchemy knowledge to him, such as the Seed Refining Method.

“This is my first time seeing a pill refined using the Seed Refining Method.”

Li Mo looked at it with the joy of a hunter spotting prey.

The so-called Seed Refining Method, as the name implied, allowed the pill to grow naturally like a plant. However, the pill did not grow in soil, but within heavenly treasures treated with special techniques.

This method produced pills of exceptional quality, but it was time-consuming and labor-intensive. Some pills could not be exposed to fire, so they could only be refined this way.

For example, the Life-Prolonging Pill.

“A thousand years to form; the pill isn’t even refined yet, but the person is long gone.”

Li Mo shook his head. Although he had no use for this item, he knew its value.

Forcibly increasing the Life Wheel!

Ordinary longevity items merely replenish the user's vital energy; they are powerless against those whose true limit has arrived.

But with this Life-Prolonging Pill, even if you went to report to King Yama, he would be confused, flipping through the Book of Life and Death for three days and nights to reconcile the accounts.

Li Mo put it away and continued to look further.

**[Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in Su Shen, saving him from the tragedy of a ruined home after the city fell.]**
**[Investment Feedback: The Su Family’s Heirloom Dumpling Filling Recipe.]**

**[Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in Qing Hao, saving him from the tragedy of death amidst the city's ruin.]**
**[Investment Feedback: Horse Appraisal Technique.]**

...

Flipping through the feedback from investments with high Destiny, Li Mo became increasingly certain of the speculation in his heart.

The investment feedback was also related to his realm and that of the investment target.

He didn't know about Gold or Red Destiny, but for Blue Destiny, the greater the difference in realms, the greater the difference in rewards.

For White and Grey Destiny, even if he saved their lives, they would no longer provide insights into martial arts.

Clicking through the interface, Li Mo began to feel a bit drowsy.

But the very next second, his sleepy eyes lit up.

**[Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'Ying Bing', permanently resolving her future worries.]**
**[Investment Feedback: Celestial Mirror of Truth.]**

**[Celestial Mirror of Truth]:** *“Can project True Spirits imprinted in Divine Observation Diagrams or various forms of marks, allowing them to reappear in this world. Those long-gone figures of elegance and the names in history books can all become your opponents.”*

*“The heroic spirit of the world forges your invincible heart!”*

*Note: This mirror must be driven by the power of all living beings.*

Li Mo couldn't help but shudder, his hair standing on end.

In other words, he could use this mirror to fight directly against the existences within the Divine Observation Diagrams?

When he observed the divine form of the Great Sage raising havoc in the Heavenly Palace, he had a vague understanding of the way to comprehend that Great Dao divine form.

Brother Monkey’s method of observation was fresh and refined; it wasn't about sitting quietly and copying.

It was one word: battle!

That was why the first divine ability he领悟ed from it was "The Will of the Great Sage." This was less a divine ability and more the fundamental method of observing this Great Dao divine form, and the ladder to truly mastering those divine abilities.

But where could he find so many opponents?

Little Li hadn't found a solution to this problem back then.

Now, Bing Dui's feedback brought the answer.

Go to the Divine Observation Diagrams, go to the history books!

---

“In other words, as long as I have enough power of all living beings, I can fight against Big Bing Dui?”

“Even... trade a few moves with Brother Monkey?”

The wounds Li Mo had just bandaged bled red again.

He was so excited his vital energy surged.

What could be a better way to temper his battle intent than trading moves with Brother Monkey himself?

A moment later, he calmed down and couldn't help but fall into thought.

Where could he get the power of all living beings?

From what he learned from Bing Dui and his own experience, this thing must not be used lightly or excessively; it requires extreme caution.

What should he do?

With this question, Little Li entered the land of dreams.

Dimly, he seemed to hear many people talking.

“Grandpa! I told you Big Brother is a peerless hero, a genius on the Hidden Dragon List, but you didn't believe me.”

“Mom, do people in the Central Plains eat dumplings when winter comes?”

“Old buddy, don't get me started. I followed Young Master Li out of the city to fight back then. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now thinking back, it makes me shiver.”

“Old Zhao was my sworn brother. He died in the chaos of battle. We have to take care of his old mother and his two kids.”

“You think we don't know about the military pay? It was all paid out of Young Master Li's own pocket...”

“......”

Mutterings echoed dimly.

In a daze, Li Mo saw strands of pure white threads coming from all directions. After delivering the whispers, they didn't disappear.

It was the power of all living beings.

However, Bing Dui's warning surfaced in his heart again. Her expression had been extremely serious and earnest.

*Rely on the power of all living beings, and once you take that step, there is no turning back.*

Li Mo had always been one to listen to advice and play it safe; he never sought death.

So, he instinctively gave up the idea of absorbing it.

......

The next morning.

The snow that had fallen all night had stopped at some point. The vast Qingmu Camp was covered in snowlight, but the three great suns could not break through the clouds.

Li Mo got up, his whole body aching. He tried to lift his arm and make a fist, but his fingers lacked strength. He could move them, but he couldn't clench them tight.

He had recovered, but not completely.

Still, he no longer had to worry about struggling with his belt when using the restroom.

Li Mo's mouth was dry. Just as he was about to pour himself a cup of water, footsteps suddenly sounded from outside.

*Slap*—he lay back down instantly.

“Ouch... why do I still have no strength in my hand... If only someone were here to feed me a sip of water right now.”

The acting skills of a Best Actor nominee need no explanation.

Unfortunately, it wasn't Bing Dui who came.

“Brother Li, I’ll feed you.”

Huang Donglai didn't suspect a thing and hurriedly poured a cup of water.

“It's fine, I stand tall and proud, why would I need someone else's hand to drink water?”

“But Brother Li, you said you couldn't move your arm?”

“Oh, my physique is good. After a moment of settling, I've recovered.”

“?????”

Huang Donglai had come to ask if Li Mo wanted to attend the victory banquet. The people of the Qingmu Camp, partly to celebrate the great victory and partly to celebrate surviving the calamity, had decided to hold the victory banquet together with the Winter Solstice.

Li Mo nodded, then felt it was a bit strange.

That's right.

What about the investment feedback for Commander Qu?

That Qingmu Great Commander, who had taken command in a crisis and risen from the Outer Scene realm to become a God General, had a genuine Light Purple Destiny.
