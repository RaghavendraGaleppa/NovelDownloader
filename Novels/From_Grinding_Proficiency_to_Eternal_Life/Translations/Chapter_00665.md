# Chapter 665: The Path After Golden Core

When Xu Yunfan returned to Primordial Origin Sect and ascended Divine Thunder Peak, the gazes of several True Lords within the sect all gathered on him.

Xu Yunfan's expression was calm. He did not immediately go to pay his respects. Having just entered the Golden Core Realm, he needed time to consolidate his foundation, even with the Attribute Panel at his disposal.

Moreover, with thousands of notification messages flashing in his vision, he naturally needed to examine them carefully.

What moved him most was that this journey had truly been perilous. But now that he had achieved the Golden Core, everything was worth it.

As time passed, the news spread. Everyone under heaven knew that a Divine Thunder True Lord had been born, yet they also witnessed the terror of the Golden Core Tribulation.

After all, in the eyes of others, Xu Yunfan's path to proving the Dao and obtaining the Golden Core was a dead end.

Leaving aside the Heavenly Dao descending with tribulation punishments—this was a necessary hardship for proving the Dao—the terror of this tribulation far exceeded that of ordinary heavenly thunder and earthly fire.

The root cause lay in the foundation of the Taihua Void Realm, which had long been gnawed away by cultivators like giant rats.

The 108 Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend Fruits were the Heavenly Dao of this realm and the basis for ascending to a Golden Core True Lord. However, the True Lords of this era were unwilling to stop there. As time passed, half of the Fruits had been swallowed and merged into their own Cavern Heavens, becoming private property to consolidate their authority and delay their lifespan limits.

The remaining Fruits were either hidden by the Heavenly Dao or empty and difficult to obtain.

With the origin of heaven and earth eroded and divided in such a manner, the Heavenly Dao was naturally unwilling.

Logically speaking, having been tricked to the point of losing its last bit of dignity, the Heavenly Dao would naturally retaliate with full force. This is why proving the Dao and achieving the Golden Core has become increasingly difficult in the Taihua Void Realm.

If a newcomer intended to prove the Dao and achieve the Golden Core, thinning the already scarce origin of the Fruits, it would be like trying to pull off the Heavenly Dao's last pair of underwear.

How could the Heavenly Dao not be enraged? In its fury, the tribulation it descended would naturally far exceed that of ancient times, being exceptionally fierce and deadly, leaving no chance of survival.

Although this Heavenly Tribulation was perilous, in the eyes of many who sought the Golden Core, it could still be fought against with supreme wisdom, powerful cultivation methods, and favorable terrain for a trace of elusive vitality.

The most terrifying and unsolvable aspect was the Human Tribulation.

The resources of the Taihua Void Realm were limited. The addition of one more True Lord meant one more person sharing the already limited authority of the Fruits and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

How could the Golden Core True Lords standing at the pinnacle of this era allow newcomers to take a share of the pie?

Naturally, they all tacitly stood in the way of all cultivators.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but look up slightly in the direction where Universal Salvation True Lord had left.

He had personally witnessed how high-spirited Hundred Peaks True Lord Chu Chengnan was when he triggered the Unmoving Mountain Fruit. Yet, at the most critical moment, a Great Arhat crossed the void with a Demon-subduing Pestle, a spiritual treasure, and shattered the fleeting opportunity for enlightenment he had exchanged for five lifetimes of accumulation.

Although Clear Source True Lord出手 to block the power of Bodhisattva Zen, he failed to prevent the scheme of a Bodhisattva of the same level killing with a borrowed blade from afar.

The infighting within Primordial Origin Sect and the indifference of the other True Lords were all invisible Human Tribulations.

The people here particularly liked to go to the新手村 (newbie village) fully geared up to block the path.

For a thousand years, since the Pure Yang Ancestor of Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, no one had been able to break through this barrier. Chu Chengnan was just the most recent and tragic example among the countless Great True Lords who had fallen on the path to the Golden Core, their cultivation废掉 (ruined).

It can be said that Xu Yunfan's success in becoming a True Lord this time was truly turning the impossible into possible, performing the ultimate dance on the blade's edge.

The depth of his layout, the danger of his schemes, and the magnitude of his sacrifices were rare since ancient times.

He knew well that although Pure Yang Ancestor Lu Chunyang was strong, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect was not a united front. His clone Han Shi, who came from a humble background, would definitely be ambushed by those coveting him within the sect upon proving the Dao and obtaining the Cangming Fruit.

The Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land viewed non-Buddhist cultivators as demonic evils and was an eternal enemy.

The infighting within Primordial Origin Sect was even more intense, and the fatal snake, Clear Source True Lord, had already borne a grudge against him.

Therefore, he executed a plan to conceal the sky and cross the sea, creating a diversion in the east while attacking in the west.

He took advantage of the Pure Yang Ancestor's presence at the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect to brazenly have his clone Han Shi simultaneously trigger the Cangming Fruit, drawing the attention of several True Lords from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and causing the internal opposition forces to stir. The Pure Yang Ancestor then forcefully suppressed the internal strife, creating a fleeting opportunity for Han Shi.

This was the first障 (obstacle).

He also took advantage of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land constructing the ritual to guide the自在王佛 (Self-自在王佛) Fruit in the Eastern Wilderness, using his clone Sun Wukong, the stone embryo nurtured by Buddhism itself, as a surprise force to execute a strategy of removing the foundation.

Clone Sun Wukong used the true words of the "Great Virtuous King of Battles Tathagata Sutra" to reverse the flow, attracting the Battle Fiend to pollute the Fruit, forcibly reversing the prototype of the Self-自在王佛 into the Battle King Buddha Fruit.

This action instantly enraged the presiding Bodhisattva Huiri, drawing the backlash of the entire Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land's power. It also allowed Universal Salvation True Lord to seize the opportunity to obstruct Huiri, successfully disrupting the heavenly机 (opportunities) of the Eastern Wilderness and letting the power of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land watch helplessly as everything in the Eastern Wilderness turned into flowing water.

This was the second障 (obstacle).

The simultaneous proof of the two clones was earth-shattering and shook the Three Sects. In reality, it was to cover up his main body, Xu Yunfan, in the Eastern Wilderness Void, using the ninety-nine strands of Immortal Gold Nature to forge the Divine Thunder that shatters all laws, and the玄穹不灭 (Mysterious Firmament Immortality) to bear the supreme imagery of all heavens.

Then, he delayed time to attract the long-hidden Divine Thunder Fruit, ranked among the top ten of the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend, to bestow its favor.

If any other Great True Lord at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm had come, no one would dare say they could break through and achieve the Golden Core under the attacks of such Golden Core True Lords.

Or rather, after witnessing Xu Yunfan's achievement of the Golden Core, all the Great True Lords at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm fell silent, their hearts filled with despair.

"Difficult, difficult, difficult! It's even more difficult than ascending to the heavens."

Primordial Origin Sect, Divine Thunder Peak.

Xu Yunfan, who was in seclusion consolidating his realm and attempting to comprehend the mysteries of the Golden Core Realm, suddenly felt confused.

The Divine Thunder Golden Core within his Dantian, coiled by ninety-nine紫金 (purple-gold) divine dragons and containing the雏形 (prototype) of an endless world of thunder, exuded vast and immense power. It made him truly feel what it meant to be a True Lord who wields thunder and shatters all laws.

The so-called Golden Core was formed by him swallowing the Fruit, combining it with his own essence, qi, and spirit,凝结 (condensing) imagery, and incorporating his own Cavern Heaven Foundation into it.

"It's a bit like a fertilized egg..."

Feeling this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but mutter to himself.

As the "Divine Thunder Nine Courts Mysterious Firmament Immortality Sutra" operated, his spiritual power surged like a starry sea. The rhyme of the Mysterious Firmament Immortality merged with his physical body and soul, bringing a sense of eternity, as if coexisting with the Dao.

But it wasn't enough. The mid Golden Core Realm was not considered true longevity. Only by stepping into the mid-stage, further developing the power of the Fruit, and making his own Cavern Heaven completely suspended and unfalling, thereby allowing for infinite reincarnation without losing his innate wisdom, could this be called immortality.

But what about the cultivation method after the Golden Core?

Just like the swordsmanship passed down by the Pure Yang Ancestor of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, which was limited to the Golden Core, the supreme realms expounded by the many true methods circulating within Primordial Origin Sect, and even the Divine Thunder Sutra he himself cultivated, and the Cangming Sword Dao proven by his clone Han Shi, all stopped at the Golden Core Realm.

The path of cultivation after the Golden Core, whether it was the evolution of the Cavern Heaven, the gestation of the Nascent Soul, or higher levels of the Dao, was all a blank, as if shrouded in an invisible mist.

In the Taihua Void Realm, those high and mighty True Lords were extremely secretive about this, treating it as their greatest secret.
