# Chapter 12: Spirit Field Harvest Day

The lively atmosphere suddenly cooled. The female cultivators who had been smiling and playfully teasing Ding Rui now had frozen smiles. After a few dry laughs, they each returned to their resting places to meditate.

Only Li Yizhen and a few others barely managed to stifle their laughter.

Ultimately, the other female cultivators only greeted Ding Rui, leaving just Li Yizhen, who had brought him there.

Li Yizhen walked up to Ding Rui and whispered, "Are you serious?"

"About what?"

"About what you just said!"

"Is there a problem with what I said?" Ding Rui asked seriously.

Li Yizhen shook her head stiffly. "No, no."

Ding Rui was baffled, feeling he didn't quite understand the female cultivators' way of thinking.

Just then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw more bees appearing not far away – three of them this time!

"Wait!" He held the spirit rice, his eyes wide as he looked at the three bees. "Didn't you say there was only one bee-cultivator?"

"That's right!" Li Yizhen was even more confused.

The bee-cultivator flew over to Li Yizhen and said, "It's fine, I'm very magnanimous. Just bring me a few wild flowers from the roadside next time."

"Definitely, definitely." Ding Rui walked out of Spirit Field No. 56, his head spinning.

Once again, this world revealed an incredibly rich and wondrous facet before him. He scoffed, shaking his head helplessly, thinking his nerves weren't strong enough to be so shocked by a mere bee. He couldn't be like this in the future; otherwise, if he saw anything more earth-shattering, wouldn't he be scared to death?

He had transmigrated, so naturally he could only claim amnesia. Fortunately, his previous self seemed to have been an orphan, so no one really cared about this.

"Senior Brother Ding." Li Yizhen, who had escorted Ding Rui out of the spirit field, suddenly called out.

Ding Rui looked back at her and smiled, "It's fine, Junior Sister Li. You can stop here; I'll return by myself."

"Alright!" Li Yizhen nodded, then glanced back into the spirit field, and suddenly leaned close to Ding Rui's ear. "Senior Brother Ding, don't pick the wild flowers by the roadside."

"???" Ding Rui's eyes widened.

...

Time flew by like an arrow, days and months like shuttles.

Two months vanished in the blink of an eye.

The young man, who was clearly only in his twenties but preferred to be called Old Huang, looked high-spirited, his eyes full of hope. He had been at the third level of Qi Condensation for some time and was about to successfully complete the path of Qi Condensation three and step into the Foundation Establishment realm. The only thing limiting him was resources. After this harvest, Old Huang would probably become an outer sect disciple!

Ding Rui also winked at Old Huang with a smile. The two had a good relationship, and since both were responsible for pest control, they were quite familiar with each other.

"Silence! Manager Senior Brother Mu is here!" Liu Yun suddenly announced, and everyone immediately fell silent and stood at attention.

Moments later, a young cultivator in an outer sect disciple's robe with a small mustache, leading a group of over ten people, slowly walked through the open entrance of the spirit field.
