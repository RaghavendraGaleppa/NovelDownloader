# Chapter 450: The Eight Scenes of Xuandu

At the third watch of the night, eight clouds of different colors hovered before Xu Yunfan, corresponding to the eight trigram directions.

Xu Yunfan held his breath and focused his mind, his fingertips dancing like butterflies as he formed hand seals.

The eight clouds before him suspended and circulated. The Kan Water Cloud was a deep blue like abyssal sea ice, while the Li Fire Cloud blazed red like boiling magma.

When he simultaneously pierced two strands of his spiritual sense into the cloud cores using the "Water and Fire Completing" method recorded in the *Scripture of the Eight Scenes of Xuandu: Forging the Clouds of Creation*, a sudden anomaly occurred.

The Kan Water Cloud abruptly erupted with frosty light, causing the temperature in the cave dwelling to plummet instantly. Ice crystals resembling spiderwebs crawled across the stone walls in a flash.

The Li Fire Cloud then exploded with a thunderous roar, sending forth thousands of sparks that turned the ice crystals into white mist.

The two clouds tore at each other frantically within the space of a zhang or so, actually forming a hurricane of spiritual power interweaving blue and red.

*Crack!*

The bluestone platform supporting the clouds was the first to shatter. Before the stone fragments could scatter, they were ground into fine powder.

Xu Yunfan hastily formed a protective seal, but then saw a blinding light erupt from the center of the hurricane.

His pupils contracted sharply. His Daoist robes billowed as he shot backward, but he was still overtaken by the turbid white shockwave of the explosion.

Where the shockwave passed, the rosewood shelves holding miscellaneous books turned into flying splinters. The *True Warrior Star Chart* hanging on the wall was instantly torn to shreds. Even the refining furnace cast from meteoric iron was overturned, its lid clattering across the floor.

When the dust settled, Xu Yunfan was seen kneeling on one knee in the corner, his jade hairpin long gone.

A lock of hair hung between his eyebrows, its tips still挂着 strange crystals formed by the fusion of ice and fire. He wiped the sweat and spiritual ash from his face, frowning deeply. "The clash between water and fire is unexpectedly this violent..."

It was a bit too much of a test for his micro-control skills.

Xu Yunfan glanced at his interface.

*‘You are cultivating the Scripture of the Eight Scenes of Xuandu: Forging the Clouds of Creation. It seems you have grasped a few key points, and your proficiency has subtly increased.’*

Xu Yunfan stared at the jumping proficiency prompt in his interface, his heart settling slightly.

Although the *Scripture of the Eight Scenes of Xuandu: Forging the Clouds of Creation* was profound and abstruse, and he had yet to even glimpse the threshold, with the proficiency prompt now, it was only a matter of time before he reached the entry level. It was like pushing open a door leading to the Great Dao of Refining.

With his unique advantage of the attribute panel, supplemented by the deductive power of the Lin Seal, as long as he persistently and repeatedly tempered this Dao-protecting technique, there would eventually be a day when he could manipulate the Eight Scenes Clouds with complete ease.

By then, let alone basic changes like the complementation of water and fire, even the supreme realm of "one cloud, one world" would be a natural consequence.

Thinking of this, his fingertips unconsciously formed a hand seal, and the True Warrior Power within him flowed in response. Since both talent and opportunity were present, the rest was just a matter of patient grinding.

All of this was achieved through my own diligent and bitter training!

Xu Yunfan sighed, looking at the list of techniques on his attribute panel, which was now almost dazzlingly full of special effect descriptors.

Each and every one of these was earned by him, step by step.

He brushed away the frost and fire crystals congealed on his Daoist robe. As the True Warrior Power circulated, the spiritual dust embedded in the fabric of his clothes fell away in rustles.

The jade hairpin had long since shattered in the explosion. Now, he casually gathered his long, disheveled hair and fixed it in place with a lightning-struck wooden hairpin—an unexpected spiritual material he had obtained while cultivating the *Azure Dragon Thunder珠 Lock Calamity Suppression Method* the day before yesterday.

It was useless to discard and tasteless to consume.

The cave dwelling was a complete mess. The *True Warrior Star Chart*, purchased for three hundred spirit stones, had been reduced to a floor full of stardust fragments.

Xu Yunfan formed a Breeze Seal, and the shattered rosewood shelf fragments gathered themselves into a pile.

When he bent to pick up the furnace lid, the meteoric iron surface reflected his own face, covered in spiritual ash, with a thin scar at his temple left by the impact of opposing ice and fire spiritual powers.

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. With his current physique, even a top-grade magic weapon crashing into his head wouldn't leave a scratch.

"The complementation of Kan and Li is this dangerous..."

After cleaning up, Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on the newly leveled bluestone platform, and the eight clouds reappeared before him.

This time, he deliberately kept a three-chi distance between the Kan Water Cloud and the Li Fire Cloud. The True Warrior Power condensed at his fingertips was also adjusted under the Xuandu Eight Scenes secret method to a more neutral Earth attribute.

The previous failure had made him understand that to control this *Scripture of the Eight Scenes of Xuandu: Forging the Clouds of Creation*, which boasts "one cloud, one world," relying on rigid brute force would not work.

If it were that simple, with the rate of proficiency increase, it would be wishful thinking to quickly reach the entry level.

This refining secret technique required thousands of repeated deductions of combinations for each breakthrough.

Li Baichuan had carried this refining secret technique with him for many years, presumably with the intention of comprehending it day and night.

It was a pity that this person's talent was ultimately a bit lacking, and he was unable to glimpse the true essence within.

The wonder of the *Scripture of the Eight Scenes of Xuandu: Forging the Clouds of Creation* goes far beyond the path of refining.

If one could cultivate the Eight Scenes Clouds, one could further evolve the "Eight Scenes Forging Heaven Formation." Using the clouds as a foundation, it transforms heaven and earth into a furnace. Its power when facing enemies is so great that it makes fellow-level cultivators tremble with fear.

It was unknown what kind of dog-shit luck Li Baichuan had to have obtained such a top-tier secret technique.

During cultivation breaks, Xu Yunfan also frequently practiced the Divine Warrior Foundation.

With a turn of his mind, the Divine Warrior Foundation erupted. The foundation transformed into a fierce, three-headed, six-armed Dharma Form that rose from the ground.

The left head swung a hammer resembling a mountain-shaking, sea-pressing mallet, drawing upon stellar power, its head entwined with the starlight of the Big Dipper's seven stars.

The right head held the Azure Dragon Crescent Blade upside down, its edge exuding a sharp, chilling gleam.

The central Dharma Form held a weapon in each hand. The left hand held a meteoric iron heavy sword slanting towards the heavens, the right hand held an eighteen-chi long serpent spear wreathed in lightning, and a halberd intertwined with thunder and fire hovered behind its back.

The last two arms formed the True Warrior Subduing Demon Seal, the flow of Dao rhyme between its fingers capable of suppressing all laws and subduing all evil spirits.

What was most astonishing was that whenever this awe-inspiringly fierce Foundation was unleashed, the spiritual energy at the peak of the mountain would surge like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, forming a violent spiritual energy vortex around the Dharma Form.

Where the heavy hammer fell, the earth's veins trembled. When the long spear thrust forth, the winds and clouds changed color. The six divine weapons evolved at will from the Divine Warrior Foundation each drew upon different attributes of Heaven and Earth's vital energy.

Sensing this commotion, cultivators within a hundred-mile radius of True Warrior Peak were all shaken in heart and mind.

At the mountainside of True Warrior Peak, Bi Sheng and Xuezhenku sat in their cave dwelling. He suddenly opened his eyes, a trace of shock flashing through his turbid gaze. "At the Foundation Establishment realm, one can actually resonate with the earth's veins?"

The Green Nymph Fairy was cleansing her lifebound flying sword in the Sword Pool when she suddenly felt the sword's edge humming. It actually tilted slightly towards the direction of True Warrior Peak, uncontrollably.

She pressed her pale hand on the sword's body, her cold and clear face showing solemnity. "Divine weapons drawing spiritual energy, the winds and clouds changing color... The pinnacle of the Martial Dao. The Martial Dao Form of the *Xuan Tian Bao Jian* can already牵动 the divine might of Heaven and Earth!"

Her gaze burned. Although Xu Yunfan was a disciple of the Dao Sect, the cultivation in her eyes was enough to be called earth-shattering.

The Mud Old Man was originally hiding deep within the earth when he suddenly felt the Earth-Fire spiritual energy below rapidly draining.

He poked his head out to look and saw that the spiritual energy had already formed a vortex, like a funnel pouring down upon the peak of True Warrior Mountain. He couldn't help but mutter to himself, "The Divine Warrior Foundation! The exclusive foundation of the Divine Warrior Realm!"
