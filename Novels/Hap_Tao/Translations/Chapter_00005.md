# Chapter 5: Stabilizing the Spirit

Deep into the night, all was silent.

Qin Ziling spread out the scripture of the "Indestructible Stellar River Visualization Technique" on his desk, resembling a large scroll of calligraphy and painting. The characters on the scripture were minuscule, yet each stroke was bold and powerful, exuding an overwhelming sense of grandeur. They carried an indescribable spirituality and profound mystery, as if merely gazing upon them could bring immense enjoyment and inspiration.

At the center of the scripture was a vast stellar river composed of countless suns, moons, and stars. In the void of this celestial expanse sat a majestic figure, clad in radiant starlight robes, his hands forming mystical seals. 

It was unclear who had painted this scripture, but the figure, though merely an image, appeared so lifelike as if he truly existed. When one looked at him, it evoked a sensation of creation itself—the genesis of heaven, earth, and the myriad celestial bodies.

Qin Ziling steadied his mind and, by the candlelight, read the scripture word by word, cross-referencing it with the fragmented memories of the text in his mind. 

Soon, he understood that the cultivation of the spirit was divided into stages: Stabilizing the Spirit, Soul Departure, Possession, Object Manipulation, Spirit Division, Soul Seizing, Manifestation, Heavenly Tribulation, and Celestial Immortality. 

The method of cultivation was simple—sit in the same posture as the figure in the scripture, form the hand seals, and visualize the vast stellar river. 

Yet, the greatest truths are the simplest, and enlightenment comes naturally. The simplicity of the method was also its greatest complexity.

Li Mo, a notorious demonic cultivator, spent ten years mastering the basics—reaching the Stabilizing the Spirit stage—after obtaining the "Indestructible Stellar River Visualization Technique." It took him another seventy years to reach the late stage of Spirit Division, barely touching the threshold of Soul Seizing. 

This was why, even though Qin Ziling was merely a martial disciple training his muscles and tendons, Li Mo failed to seize his body. Instead, both suffered heavy losses, ultimately allowing Qin Ziling from another world to merge with his remnants.

The spirit is the most ethereal and intangible, impossible to grasp or see. Thus, the term "Stabilizing the Spirit" may sound simple, but stabilizing something so elusive is incredibly difficult—almost impossible to begin with. 

Without stabilizing the spirit, sitting in meditation and visualizing the stellar river would be nothing more than an empty posture, a mere formality. It would not strengthen the spirit in the slightest. 

For this reason, the Stabilizing the Spirit stage alone barred the vast majority from the path of spiritual cultivation. 

Moreover, every breakthrough after this stage was equally arduous. 

Despite the difficulty of progression, the power of spiritual cultivation in its early stages was weak, disproportionate to the effort required. 

For example, Stabilizing the Spirit merely allowed one to enter a profoundly serene state of mind, but this could not be used in combat. 

Soul Departure only enabled the spirit to leave the body and wander the world like a ghost, capable of deluding or frightening ordinary people with weak wills through illusions. However, it could not harm their physical bodies. Worse, approaching someone with vigorous life force could cause the spirit to be burned by their energy. 

Only when the spirit grew strong enough to reach the Possession stage did it gain some offensive power. Yet, this was limited to possessing creatures with ordinary life force. Attempting to possess a stronger being would severely damage the spirit. 

It was not until the Object Manipulation stage, where the spirit could control external objects, that spiritual cultivation saw a qualitative leap in power. At this stage, one could wield weapons without a trace, striking unpredictably and lethally. 

Given how difficult spiritual cultivation was to begin with—requiring extraordinary talent—and how little power it yielded in the early stages, practitioners of this path became exceedingly rare over time. Combined with the inherently elusive nature of spiritual techniques, spiritual cultivation and its practitioners had become shrouded in mystery, as if belonging to another world. 

Had Qin Ziling not merged with Li Mo's remnants—a practitioner of spiritual cultivation—he would never have encountered this path in his lifetime. 

And now, before him lay a secret spiritual cultivation method, veiled in mystique since ancient times. 

"According to Li Mo's memories, Stabilizing the Spirit is a state where the mind reaches an extreme level of clarity. In this state, one completely forgets the external world and their physical body, allowing them to touch the existence of the spirit and visualize the Indestructible Stellar River."

"To enter this state, one must first undergo meditation, contemplation, and mental training, often aided by precious calming incense. Only after years—even decades—of persistent effort might one glimpse the Stabilizing the Spirit state." 

"Precious incense is out of the question for me. That's a luxury only the wealthy can afford." 

Qin Ziling shook his head wryly and continued reading the scripture, cross-referencing it with Li Mo's fragmented memories. 

Since his rebirth, Qin Ziling's senses had sharpened, his mind had grown agile, and he could multitask effortlessly. His memory had also become nearly photographic. 

Thus, he quickly absorbed the densely written scripture from start to finish. Along with Li Mo's memories, the "Indestructible Stellar River Visualization Technique" was now firmly imprinted in his mind—even the visualization diagram was etched into his consciousness. 

Qin Ziling stored the scripture in his Corpse Nurturing Ring. 

After being refined, the ring had transformed into a fine line resembling a skin marking, coiled around his little finger. It only became visible when in use—a truly mystical artifact. 

Putting away the scripture, Qin Ziling opened the window and gazed at the starry night sky. After a long moment, he sat cross-legged beneath the window, forming the hand seals as described in the technique and guided by Li Mo's experience. 

He emptied his mind of all distractions, forgetting the external world and his physical shell. Only his spirit—unbound by space—remained, seated beneath the stars as celestial light poured down, nourishing and strengthening it. 

Before long, Qin Ziling felt as though he truly saw himself sitting beneath the cosmos, starlight seeping into his being. A profound coolness and exhilaration coursed through him, reaching his very bones, even evoking a sensation of weightless bliss. 

His visualized spirit, initially hazy and flickering like wisps of smoke, gradually became clear and solid—an exact replica of himself. It was so vivid that he could no longer distinguish reality from illusion. 

"This..." Qin Ziling soon opened his eyes. 

"When the false becomes real, the real becomes false. What is real? What is false? Mortals believe what they see is real and what they don't is false. Yet they fail to realize their minds are clouded by distractions, perceiving only the physical shell while dismissing the spirit residing in the celestial court of the mind as mere illusion." 

"To enter meditation and witness the true self in the celestial court—this is Stabilizing the Spirit." 

"I've already reached the Stabilizing the Spirit stage!" 

Qin Ziling was stunned and incredulous. 

Li Mo, a grandmaster of the demonic path, spent ten years meditating before barely entering this stage—and even then, he relied on precious incense for assistance. 

Yet Qin Ziling had achieved it effortlessly with just a single attempt. 

This was far too fast. Far too easy!
