# Chapter 250: The Path is Paved

Chu Pianran’s dark hair flowed like a waterfall, her beautiful eyes deep as she recounted tales, as if transported back to an ancient era where immortals traversed the lands. She spoke of the methods for breakthrough for certain special Lishi.

Qin Ming listened quietly, his thoughts soaring.

Were there supreme experts among the Lishi? Yes, but the process of creating them was incredibly cruel. It required replacing divine bones, mending immortal skin, and then boiling them in an immortal furnace. Undoubtedly, these were the methods of ancient great powers, who did not treat Lishi as human beings; it was almost akin to refining artifacts. Ultimately, this process could forge top-tier battle bodies.

Of course, most such special Lishi were puppets. For who would be willing to invest such outrageously precious materials—like divine bones and immortal skin—if the Lishi could not be guaranteed to be 100% under their control?

Qin Ming offered a faint smile and nodded slightly, occasionally interjecting with questions, asking for detailed explanations. Chu Pianran was surprised. She had only mentioned these special Lishi to illustrate the cruelty of that path, and how it was now impassable given the changed environment of the modern era. In this age, divine bones and immortal skin were nowhere to be found, unless one ventured deep into the Night Mist world to hunt living god-like or near-immortal beings. She was quite taken aback that Qin Ming seemed to be gaining insights, looking as if he had made a great discovery.

Qin Ming asked again, "What about the 'Heavenly Radiance from Beyond' in ancient times, and the 'Essence of Starlight' or 'Purple Haze from Beyond'? How did they compare to what we have now? Were they more intense, or slightly weaker?"

Chu Pianran’s fair, lovely face bore a smile as she replied, "In terms of intensity, they should be similar. However, what you mentioned are actually all of the same category, branches of Heavenly Radiance from Beyond."

Qin Ming's spirit lifted even further. In the path he had envisioned for himself, these were all external substances that could be merged. Now, hearing her say they could all be considered 'Heavenly Radiance' made it even more interesting. "Heavenly Radiance can be divided into many types," he mused, feeling the path ahead becoming increasingly clear.

Chu Pianran explained, "Some Heavenly Radiance is gentler, while others are incredibly violent. Most are used for refining artifacts."

Qin Ming nodded repeatedly, contemplating his future path. Naturally, he wouldn’t dismantle his own divine bones, mend immortal skin, or replace parts of his body. While ancient special Lishi might achieve rapid power growth in the short term, such methods would inevitably cap their potential. He thought of his own advantages: others feared Heavenly Radiance from Beyond, but he could directly endure it. Back in Red Glow City, he had entered the Thunder-Fire Alchemist Hall and directly faced such violent substances!

The Heavenly Radiance cultivated within the human body was quite different from external Heavenly Radiance; the former was naturally much milder. Others primarily absorbed Heavenly Radiance from Beyond little by little through three-colored flowers, five-colored spirit branches, and fallen fruits, whereas he could face the source directly and accept the most violent baptism.

In Qin Ming's original plan, he intended to temper Heavenly Radiance with Essence of Starlight and Earthly Fiends. Later, he considered that temporary merging was also fine; afterwards, he could visit places like the Thunder-Fire Alchemist Hall for intensive tempering, "splitting off" harmful substances and "purifying" them. Now, hearing Chu Pianran's words, Qin Ming suddenly understood. Even the so-called Essence of Starlight and Purple Haze from Beyond were branches of Heavenly Radiance, so there was even less to worry about. These were his "divine bones" and "immortal skin." For others, these were unapproachable substances, too saturated with fiendish qi that could destroy the physical body. But ever since he embarked on the New Life Path, he had not feared Heavenly Radiance's erosion. He could merge first, then refine.

Of course, he didn't need to return to Red Glow City or the Thunder-Fire Alchemist Hall. Kunling City had many Tongtian Towers, which he and Little Wu had seen on their first day there. These tall towers were normally used to receive external thunder-fire Heavenly Radiance, which cultivators of the Immortal Path used for artifact refining and the like.

Furthermore, the fundamental principles of the Silk Scroll Art he cultivated aligned perfectly with this. In fact, a patriarch had left a message on a silk scroll, after some grumbling, specifically noting a crucial phrase: "Merge is the word."

"One must seek within oneself, but also borrow from external things." This was an insight he had gained during the first realm of the New Life Path, and it remained applicable in the current stage. He needed to cultivate unique arts and integrate them, and also refine various powerful Heavenly Radiance types, fusing them together.

Moreover, he had another idea: the convergence of thunder and fire, the meeting of dragon and tiger, internal alchemy for a great medicine. He had once used this to refine all his Heavenly Radiance Qi into a unified elixir, which resolved the hidden dangers of the Silk Scroll Art. Now, he could perfectly integrate this approach. "Merge new unique arts, refine entirely new Heavenly Radiance substances like Essence of Starlight, blend dragon and tiger into an internal golden core, then cause it to explode and nourish my own body."

At the same time, he pondered that such internal refinement would require precise control over World Fire and Thunder-Fire Heavenly Radiance. His current Purple Mansion Thunder-Fire and Five Thunders Refining Organs techniques might not be stable enough as he advanced to the second realm, and as his cultivation continued to grow, they might prove insufficient for his internal refining. Instantly, Qin Ming thought of the legendary *Eight Views Divine Radiance Scripture*. Techniques like Purple Mansion Thunder-Fire and Five Thunders Refining Organs were all encompassed by it. This top-tier scripture of the New Life Path was not lost; it was likely in the Outer Immortal Land. When they challenged the Six Royal Ancestral Court last time, the *Brawling Immortal Scripture* used by those people bore its strong influence. "It doesn't matter if I don't have it now; I don't need it yet."

However, all of his current ideas required sheer innate ability to endure. For ordinary people, directly enduring the erosion of Heavenly Radiance from Beyond was impossible. Currently, Qin Ming had no way to make it universally applicable; he could only first enhance himself, and once his strength was high enough, return to the source and find a way to analyze it.

Qin Ming and Chu Pianran conversed for a long time, drawing many curious glances. Other immortal seeds and divine seeds, in fact, greatly wished to discuss the Dao with the strongest successor of the ancient immortal dao field. This group included Cui Chonghe and Su Shiyun, both showing unusual expressions. Even after Li Qingyue arrived, she cast several glances their way.

An ancient also looked over, with a hint of displeasure. He was Zhao Shuyu, a core disciple of the immortal dao field and one of Chu Pianran's ardent supporters. He was at the peak of the third realm, incredibly strong. The last time Chu Pianran narrowly lost to Qin Ming, he had pursued Qin Ming and launched several full-force slashes.

Zhao Shuyu, while chatting with people from the Immortal Path, asked, "In your era, did Lishi ascend to heaven? Can they actually suppress immortal seeds in the same realm?"

"Watch your words. Dare to disrespect again, and someone will beat you back to ancient times!" a passing youth interjected. He had a unique appearance, clearly an "unusual person": his head was as large as a basin, his legs thick as pillars, his hands like palm-leaf fans, his head covered in needle-like black hair, with a broad mouth, square nose, and thick eyebrows over large eyes.

"Who are you?" Zhao Shuyu demanded.

"Xiang Yiwu, abandoned disciple of Tathagata."

Immediately, Zhao Shuyu fell silent. His ears had nearly worn calluses over the past two days, hearing about the great battle between several patriarchs of the New Life Path and the Immortal Path ancestors that shook the Night Mist world. How could he not know of Tathagata, or Qingtian?

After Qin Ming and Chu Pianran parted ways, Qin Ming walked towards Xiang Yiwu.

"Brother Xiang!"

"Should I call you Brother Qin, or Brother Li?" the burly youth asked with a smile. He had cultivated a pair of "Insightful Eyes" that could discern reality, so Qin Ming's disguise had not fooled him that day. Soon, the two engaged in a lively conversation, as they had felt like old friends from their first meeting.

"Want to exchange scriptures?"

"Exchange!"

Qin Ming felt this person was very much to his liking; he had already been considering this, and the other party brought it up himself. As peerless talents on the New Life Path, they naturally had much to discuss. Qin Ming inevitably brought up the choices in the second realm and the extreme difficulty of collecting various exotic materials.

"Kunling has a fiend-land with various divine substances, but it's extremely dangerous," Xiang Yiwu informed him. Kunling was a particularly special region where forbidden lands, blessed lands, and fiend-lands coexisted, along with the legends of the lost Jade Capital.

Qin Ming was very interested and questioned him in detail. In just a few moments, he was eager to rush there, feeling certain that it contained the "Night Matter" he needed. Xiang Yiwu explained that not only did it contain various Earthly Fiends and Yin Fiends, but also external 'Star Fiends', and not just one type—possibly even legendary ones. So-called Star Fiends referred to substances from beyond this world, perhaps also a type of Heavenly Radiance!

Qin Ming realized that the problems that had been troubling him could all be solved near Kunling. He very much wanted to set off immediately and achieve something in the second realm. He just didn't know if his various plans could greatly shorten the "External Saint" stage of cultivation. He not only desired powerful Heavenly Radiance Qi but also wished to rise quickly.

At this time, many people were secretly observing Qin Ming, such as Luo Yao, the white-clad girl from the Immortal Land, who was approaching. However, when she saw a black-clad woman, she abruptly stopped, her expression not looking good. This woman had once used a top-tier exotic treasure to obstruct her sister. Tang Jin sensed her, turned, and saw her. "Has your sister arrived? I miss her dearly."

"She'll be here soon!" Luo Yao replied defiantly.

"Little Sky Lark, why do you always speak well of him? Do you know him?" From afar, the purple lightning beast, transformed into human form, her figure curving gracefully, purple hair cascading over her shoulders, looked rather languid. She held a stemmed wine glass, gently sipping the fine wine, her gaze slightly hazy.

Sky Lark immediately shook its head. "No, I don't know him. It's mainly because we both come from the Black-White Mountain area, and I admire him greatly."

The girl transformed from the purple lightning beast had no good impression of Black-White Mountain at all. There, she had been inexplicably ridden twice, which she considered a great humiliation, and the "case" had not been solved to this day! The purple-haired girl swirled the wine in her crystal goblet, asking casually, "Oh, was he very famous there in the past?"

Sky Lark stood on the table, holding a small wine glass with its wings, also drinking, and quite tipsy. It nodded seriously, "When he first embarked on the New Life Path, he eliminated harm for the people, single-handedly flattening Golden Rooster Ridge. Afterwards, he even staked out the Golden Thieves and got rid of them too."

No doubt, tipsy from drinking, its mind was overheated, not as sharp as usual.

"What?!" The purple-haired girl's beautiful face first froze, then filled with shock, and finally changed drastically, her fur practically standing on end. The old case was solved today? In an instant, her purple eyes blazed with fire as she turned to look at the famously renowned youth on the New Life Path!

Sky Lark hiccupped, fanning its beak with its tiny wing a few times, lamenting, "It's over, I blabbed! Mountain Lord, I'm so sorry!"
