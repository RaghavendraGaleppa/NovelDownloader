# Chapter 358: Do You Want to Progress?

Ying Bing’s small boat circled back. Standing on the flat vessel, her gaze pierced through the distance, fixated on the mountain wall.

Not far from her, several demonic sect members left behind by the Summoning Demon Cult to act as a reception party trembled violently, a sense of regret creeping into their hearts.

Could it be that this Holy Maiden of the Immortal Sect found them an eyesore, which was why she was frowning?

If she decided to chop them up, where would they even go to plead their case?

Unfortunately, they had no idea what the "Holy Maiden of Myriad Manifestations" was thinking.

"He should be fine..."

Ying Bing frowned.

These followers of the Summoning Demon Cult were at least at the Inner Scene Realm. The stronger ones were Fifth Realm Outer Scenery experts, comparable to the sect leaders of prefecture-level sects. Moreover, coming from an ancient demonic sect, their methods were uncanny and unpredictable.

In any place, they were big demons capable of stirring up great chaos, or even warranting pursuit by the Patrol Sky Guards.

And he, after all, was only at the Observation of the Divine Realm.

This was no different from dancing on the tip of a blade or plotting with a tiger. If he were slightly careless, the consequences would be unimaginable.

However.

He had left behind the prayer beads that allowed him to travel to the Suspended Temple at any time... for her.

"He said he could stand on his own."

"At this moment, what I must do is trust him... and ensure he has no worries behind him."

Ying Bing bit her lip. One of her fair hands rubbed the large-headed doll at her waist, while the other subconsciously rotated the prayer beads.

But if there really were any changes...

Her clear, deep eyes suddenly flickered with alternating light and shadow, a chilling intent flashing silently.

"!"

The several summoning demon cult priests nearby recoiled in shock, their hair standing on end as if a sharp sword hung above their heads.

Why was she rotating the prayer beads?

Could it be that someone was about to be enlightened?

This Holy Maiden of Myriad Manifestations... had she just harbored a killing intent? She definitely did, right? Otherwise, why would they feel an illusionary sense that killing these evil demons was as easy as crushing an ant?

......

Inside the small world.

"May I ask for your esteemed name, sir?"

"The humble one is Heitu (Black Earth)."

"?"

"The first martial art I learned was the White泽's, so my master bestowed this name upon me. It is called Black Earth, which happens to contrast with White泽."

"I see."

This place was a stage set up by a certain Li Mo, utilizing the imagination accumulated from reading novels to the extreme. It resembled a palace above the clouds, a place that could only be described as a fairyland.

Li Mo walked ahead with his hands behind his back, looking leisurely.

Behind him, Luo Yexian and a group of summoning demon cult priests followed cautiously, looking around like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden.

They were utterly shocked by the spectacle of cultivation.

"If the Myriad Manifestations Immortal Sect truly exists, why have we never heard of it?" Luo Yexian was also filled with shock, but his cautious nature kept a sliver of suspicion intact.

Later, he should test the waters subtly, but he must not offend the other party too much...

Walking ahead, Li Mo’s neck fur swayed slightly.

Hmm...

These summoning demon cult members were indeed cautious enough.

But fortunately, Young Master Li’s preparations went far beyond this!

As they walked, a figure appeared in the jade-colored pavilion ahead. His aura was like the morning sun, making everything around him seem open and bright.

The summoning demon cult members, after all, practiced demonic martial arts. Upon seeing this person, they immediately felt as if ice and snow were meeting the scorching sun.

"Who is this person..."

"This is Senior Brother Jinwu."

Li Mo introduced him to them.

"!!!"

Including Luo Yexian, the group from the summoning demon cult was struck as if by lightning.

Jinwu (Golden Crow)!

It was actually a Golden Crow!

It must be known that the deceased Han Zhen, while alive, most regretted and often sighed that he had never retrieved the Golden Crow Ancestral Spirit in his lifetime!

In the Great Shang tribe, the Golden Crow was the most dazzling divine will on the Bronze Divine Tree!

It was also the most powerful branch. The strongest pure-blood Golden Crow of the Golden Crow clan, wielding the Dao of the Sun, could merge with the great sun, its gaze covering the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Earths! Watching over all living beings!

And now.

The long-extinct Golden Crow clan had actually appeared here?

"The humble one admires the Golden Crow clan greatly, I wonder..."

"The Golden Crow clan? No, this person is not of the Golden Crow clan, but... a Primordial Golden Crow. It is the most ancient Golden Crow in the heavens and earth."

"Hiss..."

Luo Yexian’s mind went blank for a moment.

Heitu meant...

The person before him was the... true body of that legendary existence who vanished in the river of time and once transformed into the sun in history?

"Senior Brother Jinwu, this friend from the mortal world seems to wish to ask for your guidance."

---

Li Mo spoke up before Luo Yexian could say anything.

The Golden Crow youth heard this, and his burning gaze swept over.

The Solar Wheel radiated sunlight, sacred and scorching.

"Challenger, step forward!"

"!!"

Li Mo watched with a smile from the side.

A practitioner of the Observation of the Divine Realm defeating a Golden Crow projection?

Only Bing Dangzi (Ice Cube) could do that...

A moment later.

The summoning demon cult members looked at Luo Yexian with a hint of sympathy. The Master of the Hundred Beasts Hall was now covered in soot, looking as if he had just been dug out of a coal pile.

It was too tragic.

A battle?

No, no, this wasn't a battle; this was being ground into the dirt.

If the other party hadn't held back, Luo Yexian shouldn't be thinking about how to win, but rather how many times he could die in a minute.

"Truly... truly a Primordial Golden Crow."

Luo Yexian had been thoroughly beaten while his mind buzzed with thoughts.

He had heard Han Zhen mention this!

Only those who wielded the Dao of the Sun could merge with the great sun!

The other party clearly hadn't used the strength of the Seventh Realm Master of Profound Mystery, yet they could still do it随意ly. There was no other possibility besides being a Primordial Golden Crow!

"Senior Brother, guests who come from afar are guests. Please stop."

Li Mo spoke at the right time, and Luo Yexian immediately cast a grateful look at him.

Next, he led them on a tour, allowing the summoning demon cult members to experience the wonders of the "Myriad Manifestations Immortal Sect" up close.

After this tour, anyone who came would be left dizzy.

There are people beyond people, and heavens beyond heavens.

It turned out that what they thought was strong was merely like a frog at the bottom of a well.

When they reached the main hall peak, Li Mo suddenly looked up at the sky and said softly:

"Master has returned."

"Sky尊 (Heavenly Venerable)?"

Luo Yexian looked up.

He, who was already filled with shock, was completely rendered speechless at this moment.

It was a magnificent palace, but the focus was not the palace, but the 'mount' pulling it.

Dragons!

Nine Dragons Pulling a Palace!

Their Holy Son had spent his life pursuing the dragon form to transform into a true dragon body. However, even a true dragon was merely a tool for the other party's travel, and just one of them at that.

This was the排场 (spectacle) of the Sky尊?

Such a spectacle, how could it not make one's heart yearn for it?

This was the Myriad Manifestations Immortal Sect?

No wonder, the other party dared to add the character 'Immortal' to the sect's name.

No wonder, the Sky尊 dared to take the title of the尊 (Venerable) of the Sky.

"Gentlemen, come back to your senses. Master has just returned from another world, breaking through the void, but he cannot meet you."

"Understandable, understandable..."

"I know, you gentlemen feel that the Summoning Demon Cult is extraordinary because there is someone above the Summoning Demon Cult, right?"

Li Mo asked casually.

Luo Yexian said respectfully and fearfully: "There is indeed some."

The sect did publicize it, but the only one he had ever seen was the Blood God summoned by Han Zhen.

He had only heard of the others; he had never seen them.

"But above Master, there is no one."

Li Mo, with a smile that was not quite a smile, touched the Colorless Pagoda in his chest.

It was a bit hot.

It meant it was absorbing the power of the living beings.

And whose power was it coming from?

"No one... Hiss..."

This statement was very suggestive!

Luo Yexian muttered to himself: "But why would the Sky尊 look upon the power of the living beings in this small Southern Frontier..."

Li Mo walked closer, patted his shoulder gently, and眯眼 (squinted) with a smile:

"Master Luo, do you... want to progress?"

Outside, a certain ice cube was still worrying.

But she was completely unaware for the time being.

These demonic sect members had already been completely fooled by the Best Actor winner.
