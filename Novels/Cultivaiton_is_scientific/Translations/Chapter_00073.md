# Chapter 73: Arrival

Due to the outermost defensive formation of the flying boat being damaged and Elder Zhao lacking the means to repair it himself, strong winds and occasional turbulent air currents swept across the deck. Even the door on the first floor creaked unnervingly under the impact of the wind and turbulence.

Under these circumstances, even Li Shiming couldn't venture onto the deck. Elder Cui warned him that without spiritual power protection, the unprotected deck was extremely dangerous. 

From a scientific perspective of his previous life, high-altitude hazards should theoretically be limited to hypoxia, low temperatures, and low pressure—none of which should pose significant threats to cultivators' bodies. However, he understood that this world's spiritual energy made many phenomena unpredictable.

Li Shiming was responsible for taking care of the nine youths. He usually rested on the second floor but would come down during mealtimes to prepare food for them. After their brush with death, the once-mischievous youths had become exceptionally well-behaved.

While cultivating on the second floor, Li Shiming found the environment far superior to using his Spirit Gathering Plate. The spiritual energy here was over twice as dense as what he had experienced in the mortal world.

During this time, he also reflected on his recent battle, particularly the "Demonic Voice Infiltration" technique—a name he had overheard from the elders' conversation. This sound-based technique was unique to the Profound Nether Sect, capable of influencing opponents before combat even began through laughter. Against lower-level cultivators, it was devastatingly effective—a single bout of laughter could incapacitate multiple enemies.

Though Li Shiming named his own sound-based technique "Demonic Voice Infiltration" after studying Jiang Bing's version, his was fundamentally different. His "Pseudo Demonic Voice Infiltration" was far inferior in spiritual energy application but surpassed the original in controlling pitch, frequency, and decibel levels. 

When using his vocal cords as a sound-producing tool under IBMz15's control, he could produce sounds beyond normal human capability. This was why the Profound Nether Sect cultivator underwater had been stunned upon hearing his "Great Compassion Mantra"—Li Shiming had simultaneously produced both vocals and instrumental accompaniment, with IBMz15 treating his vocal system as a complex speaker.

This realization led Li Shiming to another idea: could IBMz15 control his entire body as an external device through programming? However, this notion quickly hit a snag—his body couldn't be recognized as an external device, suggesting his connection with IBMz15 wasn't as profound as he'd imagined.

Shaking his head to clear his thoughts—his brain feeling overloaded from borrowing IBMz15's processing power—Li Shiming stood and walked to the window. 

Through the second-floor window, he saw that the flying boat had left land far behind and was now soaring over an endless ocean. Fish occasionally leaped from the water, and he even spotted a sea beast jumping dozens of meters high before diving back down to sweep through a school of fish. He was certain the creature was manipulating spiritual energy—IBMz15's analysis confirmed no purely muscular creature could perform such a feat.

"Dangerous seas," Li Shiming warned himself silently.

Three days later, the flying boat arrived at an archipelago. 

"We're here," announced Elder Zhao, rising to his feet. He instructed Li Shiming, "Go manage the newcomers below and prepare to disembark."

Bowing in acknowledgment, Li Shiming glanced out the window before heading downstairs. Below, nine islands arranged in a Nine Palaces formation stood out starkly against the ocean's surface, with smaller islets scattered beyond.

Under Elder Zhao's control, the flying boat descended toward the central island of the formation. As they approached, Li Shiming realized the island's true scale—far larger than it had appeared from above. 

Shrouded in mist, the island revealed an immortal paradise upon closer inspection: pavilions, bridges, flowing streams, and cranes dancing gracefully through the air. The flying boat landed on a platform before an elegant tower named "Clear Autumn Pavilion."

As the cabin door opened and Li Shiming led the nine youths outside, he nearly choked on the overwhelming spiritual energy. The density here was several times greater than even the flying boat's second floor—so rich he hadn't imagined it possible to be overwhelmed by spiritual energy. The youths, lacking cultivation techniques, remained oblivious to the phenomenon.

Through recent experiences, Li Shiming had learned why few spiritual root candidates cultivated beforehand. Most with cultivator relatives only had access to inferior techniques from rogue cultivators outside sects. Moreover, practicing incorrect techniques could hinder future development. Additionally, those who had cultivated faced stricter evaluations—failure meant exclusion from the Heavenly Ocean Sect.

Li Shiming had been fortunate. Had he practiced a subpar technique, joining the sect wouldn't have given him any advantage over untrained newcomers. The time and risks involved in converting to a new technique would outweigh any benefits of early cultivation.

After bidding farewell to Elder Zhao, Elders Cui and Dai flew off, leaving Elder Zhao to address the ten newcomers:

"You have three months to reach the first level of Qi Refining—forming a spiritual energy vortex within your body counts as successful initiation. Senior brothers will guide you in this. Before that, you must carefully select a primary cultivation technique, as most cultivators never change their Qi Refining techniques—lifespans at this stage don't allow for such transitions. Your guides will advise you on technique selection."

His gaze turned stern. "Those who fail to reach the first level in three months will become labor disciples. Forget about returning home—once here, you either reach the fifth level of Qi Refining or die of old age. No one leaves the sect's territory otherwise."
