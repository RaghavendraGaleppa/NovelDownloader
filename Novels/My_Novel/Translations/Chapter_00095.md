Chapter 95: A Guest of the Lady, a Golden Noble

The door opened, and the visitor was none other than Uncle Fu.

He had come to report on the gains from yesterday.

There were three main spoils: horses, silver, and ironware. Thirty horses, thirty-seven taels of silver, and eighty-one pieces of ironware.

In addition... there were quite a few miscellaneous items like clothing and ornaments. If converted into money, they would be worth several hundred copper coins.

The harvest was enormous. An ordinary farmer, toiling under the sun for 365 days a year for an entire lifetime, would find it difficult to see such a sum of money.

It was no wonder so many people became bandits.

With this, the issue of food and clothing for Black River Village could be temporarily resolved. With the surplus of iron weapons, every person could be armed, further boosting their combat effectiveness.

After a moment of calculation, Li Xian said, "Uncle Fu, take the silver to buy rice, and replace the fishing nets with iron nets and iron shields. As for the thirty horses, I will handle them."

Under the jurisdiction of One Union Manor, there were multiple industries: agriculture, sericulture, animal husbandry, and commerce.

The Lady rarely showed herself, but she was an expert at management and operations.

Everything was kept in perfect order.

To the southwest of the manor was a horse ranch, also under the Lady's property. Li Xian had patrolled there before and had exchanged a few words with the ranch workers and manager, becoming a familiar face.

He had some knowledge of the horse trade.

A typical horse was worth around two taels of silver. If its bloodline was pure, the price could rise a bit, but it would absolutely not exceed five taels.

If it were a rare breed, that would be a different matter altogether.

It was said that in places like the Prefecture City, the big shots rode all kinds of strange mounts, not just horses. But that level was too far removed from Li Xian.

"Master Li, good morning. Are you patrolling here again today?"

The ranch manager saw Li Xian, ran out with a smile, and waved in greeting.

"Yoh, you're not leading a team this time? Why are you alone?"

The manager looked behind him and, seeing only Li Xian, couldn't help but ask in surprise.

"Manager Liu, long time no see," Li Xian said with a smile.

"Indeed, it's been a long time since you came here to patrol. Please come over, let's go under the tent for some tea."

This manager was surnamed Liu, a man in his middle years, slightly plump. It was clear that managing this ranch had given him a comfortable life.

"No need for tea. I'm not here to patrol this time," Li Xian got straight to the point. "I'm here to do business."

"Ah?!" Manager Liu was taken aback.

"Call a few of your men and come with me," Li Xian gestured. Although Manager Liu was puzzled, he didn't dare to offend. After all, a "Grade B Guard" was not someone to be trifled with; they were all formidable figures with several martial arts skills under their belt.

He called three workers and followed Li Xian. They turned into a patch of forest and saw dozens of horses standing conspicuously under a grove of trees.

Li Xian said, "Manager Liu, these horses were entrusted to me by someone to be sold to the manor."

"Who exactly it is and what the situation is, you'd best not ask. After all... we are, in the end, just working men. As long as the procedure is in line with the manor's rules, why do you need to know so much?"

"Just give the price the manor usually pays for horses."

Manager Liu nodded. "I understand, I understand." He immediately went forward to inspect the quality of the horses.

"The horses are quite thin, their coats are curly, their appearance is average."

"The shape of their hooves is deformed. What rough horse-keeping skills. Master Li, could that person be a bandit? Hahaha."

Manager Liu laughed casually.

"You've hit the nail on the head," Li Xian thought to himself.

"I've taken a rough look. For one horse... hmm... I'll offer one tael and eight hundred wen. Master Li, does the owner have any objections?"

Manager Liu asked cautiously.

Li Xian shook his head. "He said the price is reasonable, higher or lower is fine."

Li Xian would have liked to haggle for a higher price. But that would just waste time and raise suspicion, so he might as well take a little less.

Since they were all familiar with each other, the transaction of horses for money was very convenient. Fifty-four taels of silver were successfully received.

Several dozen taels of silver required a large cloth bag to carry. It was extremely heavy in his hand.

"By my count, I now have a fortune of sixty taels."

"What a pity..."

"I'm a man who can't seem to hold onto money."

The silver hadn't even warmed in his hands before Li Xian hurried towards "Ziyun County" near the ranch.

The counties under the jurisdiction of Qiongfufu were not very different from one another. The customs were also similar, only the street layouts were slightly different.

"Money must be spent where it's needed."

"The Fifth Chief is a favored child of heaven who has undergone a change. His strength is still unknown. Before he arrives, I must make adequate preparations."

Although he had just arrived in this county, he now had some experience in the Jianghu, so he headed straight for the county's "Pavilion of Elixirs".

Naturally, he was there to buy elixirs to deal with a powerful enemy!

Inside the Pavilion of Elixirs were shelves of jars and bottles, containing various elixirs with vastly different effects.

Those who came and went were all martial artists.

Li Xian wasn't in a hurry to buy elixirs. It was rare for him to be outside, and he was more inclined to look around.

"Shopkeeper, do you have any Jade Skin Elixirs?"

A clear voice was suddenly heard.

An exceptionally spirited white horse stopped outside the door.

A young girl, draped in a fox-fur cloak, with fair skin, beautiful features, and lips as red as cherries, strode into the pavilion. Her voice reached them even before she entered the door.

"Jade Skin Elixirs?"

"My lady, my shop is small, I run a small business, it's not worthy of your attention."

The shopkeeper of the Pavilion of Elixirs hurried over with an ingratiating smile. If it were any other time, his words would have been subtly mocking and unpleasant to hear. But at this moment, they were sincere and full of flattery.

"This girl has an extraordinary background," Li Xian mused.

The Jade Skin Elixir is a rare and precious elixir.

Elixirs in the world are divided into three grades: the lower grade are common elixirs, the middle grade are rare and precious elixirs, and the upper grade are rare divine elixirs.

Within the common elixirs, there are further distinctions of quality. Within the rare and precious elixirs, there are nine ranks.

The various intricacies of the Way of Martial Arts are as vast as the sea. Each character—eating, nurturing, training, soaking—contains profound knowledge.

Li Xian had happened to hear about the rare and precious elixir "Jade Skin Elixir" from Pang Long. This elixir is shaped like green jade and emits a faint, refreshing fragrance.

It has always been loved by women. Consuming it can rejuvenate the complexion, make the body exude a fresh fragrance, expel bodily impurities, and for a period of time, prevent the accumulation of worldly filth.

It is also of great benefit to the Way of Martial Arts.

The Lady enjoys eating this elixir, keeping her body flawless and pure.

"Still don't have it?" The girl in the fox-fur cloak frowned and muttered to herself, "It has to be at least a rare and precious elixir to be worthy as a gift for that Lady."

Hearing the word "Lady," Li Xian grew curious.

The girl in the fox-fur cloak then asked, "Then, may I ask if you have any other rare and precious elixirs here?"

"Yes, we do," the shopkeeper said, bringing over a jade brocade box. "This is the River-Turning Elixir, a ninth-rank rare and precious elixir. Please, take a look..."

Before he could finish, the girl waved her hand. "Aiya, what use is this kind of inferior elixir to me?"

"Do you have anything better?"

"N-no, we don't," the shopkeeper said helplessly. "My lady, you must be from the Prefecture City. It's not easy to get rare and precious elixirs here. We truly cannot satisfy you, I ask for your understanding."

"Alas."

The girl sighed, mounted her horse, and left without a single glance at the people around her. Only a trail of fragrant wind lingered in the air.

"Stop staring."

"You lot, don't even think about it. I can tell you don't know much about these things, so I might as well tell you."

"The sachet that young lady was wearing is worth seven hundred taels of silver. It's called 'Seven-Transformations Fairy Tea Fragrance'. If you take a whiff, heh, you can consider it a blessing from your past life."

"And that young lady's fur coat and boots. Any one of them... the price would be enough to buy my entire Pavilion of Elixirs."

"That, my friends, is a true Golden Noble. The very air she exhales is not something we are qualified to breathe."

The shopkeeper said this gleefully, proud to have spoken to such a person.

Li Xian watched her ride away.

Riding a horse and roaming the Jianghu... eating rare treasures, enjoying precious elixirs. Judging by her age, she was about the same as him, and was at least at the [Consuming Essence] realm.

It seemed that people like her were the true Jianghu martial artists.

As for himself, although food and clothing were no longer an issue, his life was under threat.

When would he be able to roam the Jianghu like them?

"It seems there is a guest at the manor."
