# Chapter 584: The Dao Fruit is Secured

Zhang Ziyang chuckled. "I have been Sect Master for several hundred years. Make your decision quickly. If you have any reservations, you can simply abandon it."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with a sharp glint as he instantly weighed the pros and cons in his heart.

Should he do it?

If he followed the conventional path, there would be no obstacles to reaching the perfection of the Foundation Establishment realm, and even attaining the Dao Fruit would pose no difficulty.

The problem lay in the fact that when it came to attaining the Dao Fruit, the Attribute Panel would indeed allow him to advance unimpeded.

But whether the True Lords under heaven would be willing to accept that was another matter entirely.

Time was life; every single moment could bring the scrutiny of a True Lord.

Having the Heavenly Empress retrieve it, while risky, was currently the only viable path.

His own karmic secret arts were also frantically deducing, confirming that this move was the sole chance of survival amidst the chaotic heavenly principles, the only way to escape utter annihilation.

He would do it!

If he didn't take it, then even if he were to attain the Dao Fruit in the future, he might not be able to hold onto his position as a Golden Core True Lord!

Without a moment's hesitation, Xu Yunfan's gaze turned as cold as a bolt of lightning, instantly piercing through the Star Banner to lock onto the trembling Heavenly Empress Star Soul within.

With a flick of the Stellar Spirit Banner, Xu Yunfan's divine sense surged.

"I command you, Heavenly Empress Star Lord! Heed my decree! Utilize the entirety of the power within your remaining soul that is of the same origin as this world's Dao Fruit. Enveloped by the banner's spiritual energy, retrieve the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit from the core of the Suspended Mirror for me. Should you show the slightest hesitation or make any move of treachery, I will immediately annihilate your body and soul, ensuring you can never be reincarnated for all eternity."

"Your servant obeys the尊上's decree!"

The Heavenly Empress felt the terrifying pressure from the brand on her soul's origin, a force capable of crushing her in an instant. Her body trembled violently, and the last trace of unwillingness in her eyes completely transformed into utter fear and submission.

She did not dare to ponder the potential sliver of opportunity that might be hidden within Zhang Ziyang's words. Xu Yunfan's absolute control over the life and death of her true spirit was an instinct that overwhelmed everything else.

No one wants to die, especially cultivators who seek eternal life.

Moreover, as a banner spirit trapped within the Stellar Spirit Banner, her life and death were not her own. Even if she possessed her own consciousness, it was merely to add a touch of liveliness. If there were any disobedience, a mere flick of the banner would turn her into a puppet.

Vast magical power poured into the Stellar Spirit Banner. As the banner trembled, under its加持, she immediately exerted her full strength to mobilize the residual aura from the Heavenly Court's Great Yin Origin deep within her soul, transforming her own soul into a unique spiritual guide.

Xu Yunfan controlled the Stellar Spirit Banner with his will, and the banner's dark surface unfolded silently.

A凝聚 of stellar power to the extreme, carrying the faint yet perfectly fitting aura of the Dao Fruit's same origin, transformed into an invisible, transparent arm. It gently and swiftly reached towards the Moon Wheel Treasure Mirror that floated and sank at the core of the inverted mirror's heart.

At this moment, even the surging, collapsing Milky Way seemed to stagnate for a brief instant.

The invisible arm, formed from the banner's power and the Heavenly Empress's soul guide, exceptionally顺利穿透 the natural flow of the Great Yin法则 barrier surrounding the Taiyin Xuanjian Treasure Mirror.

This was originally the last gap left by the Heavenly Dao for the vessel it favored. Now that the Heavenly Empress had come to retrieve it, and the Heavenly Court was facing a great calamity, the Heavenly Dao naturally would not refuse.

The water-like surface of the treasure mirror rippled gently, as if sensing the familiar yet unfamiliar origin aura. It seemed hesitant, but was also confused by the pure attributes of the Heavenly Empress's soul at that moment, and was further concealed by the Stellar Spirit Banner's powerful ability to disguise its nature.

It did not trigger any of the anticipated violent energy backlash, nor did it provoke a counterattack from the will of the Heavenly Dao.

While the three True Lords, with their majestic divine might, were busy dividing the Dao Fruit of the Heavenly Emperor and the remnants of the Western Buddha's head, the Moon Wheel Treasure Mirror—which carried the core of this world's Great Yin法则 and was the final manifestation of the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit—was, like a drop of water entering the sea, silently enveloped by the invisible arm and instantly pulled into the depths of the Stellar Spirit Banner.

Success!

Xu Yunfan's heart nearly leaped out of his chest, a tremendous wave of joy instantly overwhelming him.

A genuine Dao Fruit!

If it were to be revealed, countless Foundation Establishment cultivators would go mad for it, and even Golden Core True Lords would not hesitate to strike and seize it.

But he did not dare to show the slightest expression on his face, and the sense of警兆 in his heart reached its peak.

Retreat!

Xu Yunfan's divine sense flashed like lightning. The Zhou Tian Stellar Spirit Banner was instantly recalled by him, coiled into a dim, grey stream of light and vanished into his sleeve.

Throughout the entire process, the three layers of concealment secret arts he had on him were operating at their peak, and three layers of array techniques were interwoven, perfectly merging his form into the chaotic废墟 energy flows and the aftermath of the war that permeated the shattered Heavenly Court.

Without the slightest bit of attachment, and without even having the time to check the newly acquired treasure within the banner or the Heavenly Empress's extremely complex state,

Xu Yunfan's figure, like a phantom, used the cover of the surging, chaotic Milky Way water vapor and the energy turbulence from exploding spatial fragments here. With a speed far exceeding his previous one, almost as if he were burning his own vital blood, he did not hesitate to frantically escape along the path he had come.

Faster!

Faster!

Xu Yunfan's Dantian Qi Sea surged with magical power, turning him into a streak of lightning that vanished in a flash.

He did not dare to follow any conspicuous paths, nor did he dare to traverse areas like the Alchemy Palace, which were treasure regions. Places like the treasury of spiritual pills and elixirs, or even the scripture pavilions, were key battlegrounds for the disciples and disciples of the Ten Thousand Swords Sect and the Primordial Origin Sect.

On his way here, he had already witnessed several clashes between Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Relying on his subtle perception of spatial aura and the keen reaction to changes in the physical environment brought by his formidable physique, forged by the Divine霄 Nine宸玄穹不灭真經,

He transformed himself into a gust of nothingness that completely merged with the folds of space. Hugging the shadows of the shattered palaces, he钻入 the cracks in the collapsed earth, and even brushed past the edges of several perilous spatial turbulence flows, all to choose the most inconspicuous escape route with the least energy disturbance.

He did not know how much time had passed. He felt that he had already completely distanced himself from the core area of the Heavenly Court ruins, even rushing out of the vast region once covered by the Heavenly Emperor's power barrier.

Before him were no longer the shattered, luxurious仙 palaces and lingering煞气, but a relatively desolate, shattered world. Mountains had collapsed, great rivers were severed, and in the sky, besides the destructive罡 winds, there was also a diffuse of relatively gentle and pure root qi from the dissipated essence of the界天.

This is the place!

Without a moment's pause, Xu Yunfan immediately found a canyon fissure deep within the earth, freshly torn open by the aftermath of the battle, and plunged into a magma cave at its bottom.

He quickly formed hand seals, setting up several layers of simple yet highly effective aura-suppressing restrictions and illusion arrays that distorted sight, completely hiding himself.

Only now did his violently pounding heart calm down slightly.

But this was not enough.

He forced himself to冷静 down and immediately closed his eyes to concentrate.

His mind sank into his sea of consciousness, operating the most mentally taxing but necessary karmic deduction secret art.

In an instant, the invisible threads of karma around him were梳理 by his divine sense like reeling silk from a cocoon, tracing back to the past and future, deducing his own connection in the matter of the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit.

Every一丝 of aura that could possibly leak, every缕 of the world's old karma that might entangle him because of the Heavenly Empress, were repeatedly scrutinized. For any he could not be certain of, he would sever them all through the Dongming蚀天箓.

A long time later.
