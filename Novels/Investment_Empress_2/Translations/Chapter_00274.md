# Chapter 274: The Fissure Sea Dragon Whale? Just One Hammer!

In the water domain.

Avoiding the undercurrents all the way, Tianjiao Xiao Li finally saw the jagged, chaotic rocks piercing the water not far away.

The reefs were arranged in a crisscross pattern, resembling the remains of a giant strange beast, or perhaps they truly were, only that the remains had been washed away by the undercurrents over many years, making them indistinguishable from the reefs.

It was hard to imagine what a terrifying size such a giant beast had when it was alive.

*Whoosh—*

A violent sound of water waves came from the pile of chaotic rocks.

Li Mo released his perception of the water flow, determining the direction from which the water waves were coming.

A moment later, he saw Guo Jing stuck inside a cave in the reef. To be precise, she was stuck in the mouth of the "Giant Beast's Remains."

She was like a lightbulb stuffed into a mouth, desperately struggling towards the whale tail outside, but the reef remains remained unmoving.

"Wu Mo!"

Guo Jing could see out from the crack in the rocks.

Li Mo asked, "How did you get stuck in there?"

"I was just passing by, but then I saw the Heavenly Outer Divine Jade and couldn't help but reveal my true form. I can't change back for the time being."

For the Demon Race, transforming isn't as simple as eating or drinking. Some even need to regularly consume special natural treasures to maintain their human form, especially for Demons at lower realms.

"Don't move first, I'll try to help you get out."

"Ah? Aren't you a traditional Demon? Doesn't that mean you have to touch my tail? I knew it..."

"?"

Tianjiao Xiao Li's mouth twitched.

So, you don't care at all if I pull your tail off while pulling you out?

"I didn't plan on pulling you out."

The Star Post Forty fell into his palm. Li Mo was about to smash the reef when suddenly...

*Woooo—*

A distant, ancient-sounding echo suddenly rang out over the water domain.

Wu Mo was startled, and Guo Jing wasn't much better, feeling a terror from the depths of her soul.

Hmm?

Li Mo turned to look. In the distance, the turbid waves parted the air. Behind a black horn was a shadow two sizes larger than Guo Jing's true form. Its obsidian-like scales seemed to distort the light.

...

"Grandma?"

A middle-aged man from the Whale Clan spoke in shock, then shook his head.

"No, its bloodline is even purer. It's a true Fissure Sea Dragon Whale! It has already grown a dragon horn!"

In front of the light screen, many great demons showed serious expressions, especially the Whale Clan.

"Why are the true spirits cast down by the Heavenly Outer Divine Jade this time so ridiculously powerful? Or is it just bad luck, running into the strongest one?"

"Our ancestors were one of the ancient ocean overlords. In terms of power, they are not weaker than a true dragon of the same realm!"

"Even if the Princess wasn't trapped, her chances of winning would be slim, let alone..."

"Now we can only rely on Wu Mo."

"But... will he help?"

At this point, the Whale Clan members fell silent.

Don't forget, there is only one Heavenly Outer Divine Jade. Once everyone enters the Palm of the Buddha's Land, all clans are competitors. If it were them, they wouldn't take a huge risk to do something thankless. This Fissure Sea Dragon Whale is definitely one of the few top existences among the true spirits.

Wu Qing and Murong Feng exchanged a glance. The couple saw the worry in each other's eyes. Based on what they learned from Murong Xiao about him, he would definitely help. But neither of them wanted to see the hope of the Winged蛟 Clan and the Fissure Sea Dragon Whale suffer mutual destruction. Wu Mo still had his own true spirit to face.

"Huh? Wu Mo is making a move!"

"Is he choosing to clash head-on with the Fissure Sea Dragon Whale?"

...

"Ancestral True Spirit?!"

Still trapped, Guo Jing felt fear from her ancestors. Her massive body trembled, and she was about to tell the two Jiao to leave first. Then she saw a figure stepping on the waves and going forward.

"If I obtain the essence of this Dragon Whale, would it allow the Seventy-Two Transformations to add another form?"

The thought flashed through Li Mo's mind, but he didn't dwell on it.

After all, a certain fighting enthusiast said: fight first, ask questions during the fight.

*Bang—*

*Bang—*

Wherever the Fissure Sea Dragon Whale passed, the seemingly unbreakable reefs were all crushed to pieces. One could already see its lifeless eyes. It didn't possess intelligence, at most some instincts left by its true spirit. Even so, it was enough for it to use the bloodline power of the Fissure Sea玄 Whale clan.

Gravity.

It can be said that this bloodline power is simple and crude, unadorned, but not weak. Not only did the tides and undercurrents around it solidify like a quagmire, but the force of its charge also multiplied.

"As long as it's not the kind I can't catch up to," Li Mo watched it crush over, feeling somewhat eager to try. He had yet to truly hit a target with that divine hammer technique. The only time he used it, he couldn't land a hit because of Yin Mianmian's strange movements.

The seven Xuan Dantian in his Dantian trembled. Fierce power surged within him. The Xuan Weapon, Star Post, felt as if it couldn't withstand the power of a Guanshen Realm expert.

Then.

An inexplicable scene occurred.

The pitch-black giant whale, over a hundred zhang long and resembling a small mountain, collided with a figure that was tiny in front of it, smaller than its horn. Though the figure was tiny, it emitted a faint golden light...

**Heaven Overturning Style!**

In that instant, it seemed even the water waves stood still.

*Bzzz—*

Outside, the bronze chimes transmitting the sound collided, producing a chaotic and harsh noise, as if a microphone had just fallen to the ground. Many gazes looked at the sky screen with suspicion. They truly hadn't expected Wu Mo to choose to go head-on!

*Crack—*

A light sound.

The next moment, the massive Fissure Sea玄 Whale true spirit was seen covered in spiderweb-like cracks, which spread from its horn to its entire body. Then, it collapsed like a crumbling mountain, its form falling like a toppling golden pillar. Boundless waves of water were blasted into the sky, turning into fine rain and mist as they fell.

"Ah?"

The great demon from the Whale Clan looked utterly bewildered.

"Holy sh*t." Murong Feng found it hard to believe, and even harder to maintain his composure.

The cloudy eyes of the monk Huai Kong suddenly shone with a clear light.

Heng Yuan opened his mouth wide, quickly chanting "Amitabha" to remind himself not to break his silence.

The demons instinctively recoiled.

"He shattered the Fissure Sea Dragon Whale with one blow?"

"Wu Mo is forever a friend of our Whale Clan!"

"That's terrifying... Hmm? Who peed? It's all over my foot."

"Sorry, I couldn't hold it in. I inked myself."

*Gasp*, "Wu Mo seems... even stronger than we thought! It's really hard to say who would win between him and the Green Luan Goddess!"

"Our peerless Tianjiao's power crushes all!"

"Our Green Luan Goddess..."

The Water Clan and the Avian Clan started arguing again.

Meanwhile.

After that bit of true spirit dissipated, a speck of spiritual light merged into his brow, guiding him to the location of the Heavenly Outer Divine Jade. At the same time, it brought him a Fissure Sea Dragon Whale phantom. If he had the essence blood...

**[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Guo Jing', helping her escape, and witnessing true power.]**

**[Investment Feedback: One drop of Fissure Sea Dragon Whale essence blood.]**

What a coincidence!

These true spirits were all projections preserved by the Jade Phoenix Goddess.

I wonder...

Is there a true dragon among them?

Or existences not inferior to true dragons?

What will his Seventy-Two Transformations ultimately become?
