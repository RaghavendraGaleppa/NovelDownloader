# Chapter 345: Vientiane Immortal Sect? You Are So Bold!

Three Mountains Town.

The town was nestled in the crevice between three massive mountains, each stretching for hundreds of miles and rising several thousand feet high.

The town was famous for several types of rare and precious特产 (specialty products).

However, for the townspeople to leave, they had to navigate a dangerous and lengthy path around the towering peaks. Only with the blessing of the Great Spirit of Witchcraft could they pass safely.

At this moment, inside the Spirit Temple.

The town chief and a group of clan elders were carefully watching a fat priest dressed in ceremonial attire, laden with gold and silver.

"Lord Priest, winter is almost here. If we don't go out to trade for supplies soon, many clansmen won't survive the winter. Please..."

"Patience. We must wait for the Great Spirit of Witchcraft to issue a decree."

"But the statue of the Great Spirit... it hasn't lit up in so long..."

The town chief was frowning deeply, his anxiety evident.

Three Mountains Town had limited arable land and poor sunlight, so the grain produced was far from enough.

They could only rely on carrying valuable mountain goods out of the mountains to exchange for food to barely get by.

Now, snow had already fallen once.

If they waited any longer, the heavy snow would completely seal the mountains, cutting the town off from the outside world. Who knew how many clansmen would starve or freeze to death.

"Without the protection of the Great Spirit, you can try to go around the mountains on your own."

The priest ate his beef unhurriedly, his mouth glistening with grease.

"We can't do that."

The old chief's expression changed.

At least since his memory began, the people of Three Mountains Town were forbidden to enter the mountains alone.

The three mountains were extremely strange, as if they could eat people.

Those who entered without permission would eventually get lost. Only by consulting the Great Spirit and receiving the mountain god's protection could they return safely.

Many young people in the clan yearned for the outside world, and there were no shortage of those who tried to sneak out.

Without exception, they all vanished without a trace.

He knew what happened to them in the end.

The old chief was once a young man who yearned for the vast world. He had even gathered a few like-minded youths to leave together, hoping to find another way out for the townspeople.

Later, despite making thorough preparations, they still got lost in the mountains.

The companions by his side disappeared one by one.

Only he, because his family had given the priest a heavy gift, was guided out.

Five years later.

He entered the mountains again with a group of strong young men and finally saw a few familiar skeletons.

They were the youths who had once tried to escape with him.

From that day on, he held a deep, instinctual reverence for the authority of the mountain god.

Without the permission of the Great Spirit of Witchcraft, leaving the mountains was absolutely forbidden!

This was a rule strictly followed by everyone in Three Mountains Town.

But now, a problem had arisen.

The Great Spirit of Witchcraft had disappeared.

Without the Great Spirit, how would they face the mountains that could eat people?

"You don't need to worry. The deity has already issued a decree."

Seeing the town chief and the elders being so cautious, the fat priest felt the timing was right.

The fat priest was actually a member of the Demon Summoning Cult.

He was genuinely afraid that these people, who feared nothing, would run out of the town.

After all, now that the Disaster Beasts were gone, the thick fog in the mountains had vanished.

If the townspeople discovered that they could leave the mountains without the so-called 'deity's' help, that would be a disaster!

Fortunately, after years of conditioning, no one dared to challenge the divine might anymore...

"The Great Spirit of Witchcraft will return soon. In the meantime, you must discipline your clansmen well and absolutely do not do anything that would grieve the deity."

Fei Lian, who once absorbed the faith of Three Mountains Town, was actually dead.

The Hall Master had sent him a message, saying a new 'mountain god' would arrive soon.

"By the way, prepare another batch of offerings."

Hearing that they had to prepare offerings again.

The town chief and the elders' faces fell.

...

That afternoon.

A divine altar had been set up at the temple at the entrance of Three Mountains Town, with various offerings placed upon it, collected by the town chief from door to door.

Around the altar, flags were erected, each painted with a totem of a deer's head and a bird's body.

"Today, the Great Spirit of Witchcraft will soon answer my call and descend with a miracle!"

The fat priest looked at the offerings and was very satisfied.

He had received the news that the new mountain god was about to arrive.

The townspeople, carrying heavy baskets, looked on with hopeful eyes.

Once the deity bestowed his blessing, they could confidently go around the mountains and trade for the hope of surviving the winter for their clansmen.

The fat priest's layers of fat quivered as he jumped into a strange ritual dance.

This totem could connect to nearby beings with Ancestral Spirit blood.

But halfway through the dance, the villagers suddenly cheered excitedly.

"The clouds! That cloud is coming down!"

"Is the mountain god about to appear in person?"

"?"

A question mark appeared over the fat priest's head.

His ritual dance was purely for atmosphere, to make things feel more ceremonial, so the townspeople would believe him more.

The real summoning technique, he hadn't even started using it yet.

The atmosphere wasn't even fully set, so there was no connection established with the Great Spirit.

So what in the world was coming down?

The fat priest squinted to get a better look.

A young man with deer antlers on his head, wearing a golden sun robe, and possessing an extraordinary aura was being carried down by white clouds to the center of the altar.

He supported himself with one hand on the ground in a half-kneel (for the specific pose, refer to the Terminator's entrance), his expression blank as he slowly rose, truly looking like a cold, high immortal descending from the clouds.

By his side were a golden-robed youth with a hood and a woman whose skin reflected a luster, crackling with arcs of electricity.

These two were also imposing and unfathomable, flanking the young man in the middle.

In front of these three, the fat priest suddenly seemed incredibly猥瑣 (wretched).

"Who are you..."

The fat priest narrowed his eyes, preparing to question them.

"You are so bold~~~, how dare you speak to a deity~~~ immortal like this!"

You see, the way they spoke was filled with thunderous echoes, truly unfathomable.

"I..."

"What 'I'? Since you are in the presence of an immortal, why do you not kneel?"

The hooded, golden-robed youth shouted in reprimand.

"?"

The fat priest's small, beady eyes flashed with confusion.

Why were these lines so familiar?

Weren't these all his lines?

But the Great Spirit sent by the headquarters was clearly not like this.

And just a moment ago, when he used the summoning technique to communicate, there was no response at all.

This was definitely not the Great Spirit sent by the headquarters!

The fat priest roared in anger:

"You dare to impersonate the deity! How bold! You..."

"You, this blasphemer of the immortal."

The young man with the deer antlers in the middle spoke, neither sad nor happy.

His voice was deep and magnetic.

There seemed to be eternally burning starlight in his eyes, making people dare not look directly.

"I have slumbered for ten thousand years, originally paying no attention to the affairs of the mortal world.奈何 (Nài hé, However), there are those who use the name of the immortal to practice deception. Do you not know that the net of heaven is vast, but nothing escapes it!"

"Now that the Heavenly尊 (Zūn, Lord) of the Vientiane Immortal Sect stands before you, you still have no heart of repentance!"

"You, this being who does not recognize the will of heaven, is blessed with shallow fortune, cultivates no magical power, cultivates no virtue, and is nothing but a creature born from fur and horns, eggs and moisture!"

"You are so bold!"

Li Mo was cold and stern, his expression like a block of ice, awe-inspiring without being angry.
