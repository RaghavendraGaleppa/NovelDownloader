# Chapter 1: Nine Yang Body Forging Technique  

"You... you're not dead?"  

Hearing Chu Ning's words, Cai Fu turned his head in shock to look behind him.  

There was no one there. Realizing he'd been tricked, Cai Fu quickly turned back, only to be met with a face full of incense ashes.  

"Ah!"  

With his eyes suddenly filled with ashes, Cai Fu instinctively dropped what he was holding and raised his hands to rub them.  

Seizing the opportunity, Chu Ning gripped the wooden staff with both hands and smashed it down hard on the other man's head.  

*Thud!*  

As Cai Fu staggered backward, clutching his forehead, Chu Ning snatched up the dagger that had fallen to the ground. He lunged forward and plunged the blade deep into Cai Fu's abdomen.  

"You... you..."  

Cai Fu uttered the same bewildered words as his young master had, then slowly collapsed to the ground.  

Unlike his master, however, his eyes remained wide open—covered in ashes, he had died with them unclosed.  

*Huff... huff...*  

Chu Ning took several steps back, dagger still in hand with the blade pointed outward, gasping for breath as he tried to calm his violently surging emotions.  

Even with the mental fortitude of a transmigrator, he couldn't help but feel a pang of fear.  

After a few minutes, once his nerves had settled somewhat, Chu Ning cautiously prodded Cai Fu with his foot to confirm the man was truly dead. Only then did he let out a long sigh of relief and prepare to leave the ruined temple.  

But after only a few steps, he paused.  

"Didn't they mention something about a body-forging technique earlier?"  

Recalling the conversation between the two men, Chu Ning steeled himself and carefully searched Cai Fu's body, finding a map and some scattered silver pieces.  

He then turned to the young master's corpse, rummaging through his robes and the bundle he had carried. Among the gold and silver he uncovered was a small booklet.  

Using the flame from his tinderbox, Chu Ning made out the words written on its cover:  

**Nine Yang Body Forging Technique**  

He flipped it open casually, but before he could examine it closely, a line of text appeared in his mind:  

**[Nine Yang Body Forging Technique (0/100)]**  

A golden finger?  

Chu Ning's heart leaped with excitement. There was no time to study it now—he swiftly tucked the booklet into his robes and hurried out of the ruined temple.
