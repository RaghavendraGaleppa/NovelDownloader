# Chapter 138: Slaying Demons and Seizing the Island!

Although most demons are crude and foolish, those inhabiting the Crimson Moon Great River have been entrenched for thousands of years, and among them are naturally some exceptionally intelligent beings.

They dispersed their forces not merely to be picked off one by one by humans. These islands, fortified with formations, employed feints and deceptions, concealing an unknown number of earth demons. Their strategy was to use localized numerical superiority to eliminate human Foundation Establishment cultivators when opportunities arose.

At this moment, nine earth demons were hidden within this bridgehead—Wolf Fang Island!

This number shocked Ma Wu and the others.

They had confidence in Gu Yuan's strength. In one-on-one combat, Senior Brother Gu would undoubtedly fear no earth demon, having even slain the extraordinary Emerald Fire Water-Eyed Ape. But with them joining the fray, the outcome of a group battle was uncertain.

They lacked confidence in their own abilities!

A mere year was too short a time for them to develop sufficient techniques.

"Hahaha, scared now, kid? If you're afraid, leave quickly! I'll spare your lives if you promise never to trespass on Wolf Fang Island again!" Seeing Ma Wu's expression change, the leading demon laughed heartily, extremely pleased with itself as it continued to urge Gu Yuan and the others to retreat.

But after scanning the nine demons before him, Gu Yuan couldn't help but chuckle: "Bears, lizards, pythons, frogs, crocodiles, water wolves... Not a single extraordinary lineage among you, yet you dare boast and demand our Dao Academy's sacred path yield?"

These nine demons had largely taken humanoid forms, riding demonic clouds with imposing auras and thunderous voices. Yet under Gu Yuan's Heaven-Piercing Spirit Eyes and Three-Eyed Divine Sense, their true forms were laid bare—serpent bodies, crocodile tails—all clearly visible.

They were nothing more than common demon breeds.

"Such arrogance, human! Do you truly think we can't handle you?" 

"Brothers, let's join forces and kill this brat to defend Wolf Fang Island!" 

Enraged, the leading water wolf brandished a green steel trident and charged straight at Gu Yuan. The other demons followed suit, summoning their spiritual tools to encircle him.

Yet their weapons were crude, their forging techniques clumsy despite the shimmering spiritual light. Their coordinated assault was equally unrefined—nearly half their demonic energy was wasted on conjuring intimidating clouds of smoke, leaving only seventy to eighty percent for actual combat.

"Senior brothers and sisters, attack now! Assist Senior Brother Gu in slaying these demons!" 

Seeing this, Ma Wu's apprehension vanished, replaced by renewed courage as he summoned his seal to confront a green lizard.

This was more like it!

If every demon possessed the formidable innate techniques, overwhelming strength, and accompanying treasures of those earlier challengers, the world would long have belonged to the demon race. 

How could these scaled and armored creatures, lacking true cultivation methods, hope to rival the elite disciples of our sacred sect?

Ma Wu advanced with soaring morale. Fu Hongling and the others likewise summoned their inferior spiritual tools or manifested seals, channeling their foundational Dao power as each engaged an earth demon.

The water wolf, charging fiercely toward Gu Yuan, suddenly realized mid-assault that only two companions remained by its side. 

The human stood calmly in mid-air, sleeves fluttering, his serene expression exuding an otherworldly aura as he regarded the three demons with icy detachment.

An involuntary shiver ran down the water wolf's spine.

"Attack together...!" it growled fiercely, trying to bolster its own courage. 

But when it turned its head, it discovered the other two had already mounted dark winds and fled without warning.

"Fools! Get back here!" it roared in fury.

"Clang!"

At that moment, a brilliant sword light—like formless lightning—suddenly split the void with unimaginable speed, striking toward the two fleeing demons' backs.

"Crash!"

The two demons summoned gales and towering waves to block the sword light, splitting up—one fleeing skyward, the other diving into the water.

"Shing!"

Yet the sword light split into sixteen beams in mid-air, eight streaking toward each target like thunderbolts. In an instant, they shattered the defensive gales and pierced through the demons' backs.

"Ah—!"

The two demons screamed before collapsing lifelessly, their bodies reverting to true forms as they fell—only to be caught mid-air by churning waters that swept them back.

It was then the water wolf realized the river beneath had silently risen, encircling it in surging currents. The waters seemed completely under the human's control—its own innate water manipulation unable to resist his dominion. 

Though standing atop the great river, the water wolf felt as though stranded in a boundless desert.

"Water-element Dao Foundation...!" 

The realization struck like lightning, but before the thought could fully form, a terrifying roar shattered its mind. Invisible thunder paralyzed its thoughts as a bamboo-like sword shadow flashed through its forehead, ending everything.

Three demons had attacked—yet within mere breaths, Gu Yuan had effortlessly slain them all.

Meanwhile, outside Wolf Fang Island, Ma Wu and the others were still locked in combat with the remaining demons.

Having cultivated three qi paths simultaneously, Gu Yuan's magic power had tripled. His sword light could divide into eighteen beams, his divine sense was thunderous as a dragon's, and though only a year into Foundation Establishment, he already possessed formidable techniques that made ordinary opponents no match for him.

"Boom!"

"Crash!"

In the distance, Ma Wu and the others fought on, but Gu Yuan remained where he was, observing. 

This was their trial. While such simple challenges no longer benefited him, they were essential for his companions' growth.

With Gu Yuan's swift victory, the battle's momentum shifted dramatically. 

Ma Wu and the others fought with redoubled vigor, their spells resounding without restraint as they fully immersed themselves in testing their skills. The remaining demons, their morale broken, sought only to flee—quickly falling into disadvantage.

"Ah—!"

At the battlefield's edge, Jiang Ningxue pressed her lips tightly, eyes blazing with killing intent. Ignoring the serpent demon's strike to her shoulder, she summoned a moon-shaped seal and smashed it down, crushing the demon's skull.

The serpent demon shrieked and tried to escape, but Jiang Ningxue pursued relentlessly despite her injuries, slaying it on the spot.

"Hmm?"

Gu Yuan noticed something peculiar—Jiang Ningxue's vitality seemed slightly restored. Though her wounds remained, her spirit appeared more vigorous. 

This subtle change would have escaped notice without his Heaven-Piercing Spirit Eyes and Three-Eyed Divine Sense. It was so fleeting he almost doubted his perception.

After her victory, Jiang Ningxue didn't pause to recover but immediately joined Fu Hongling's fight, seemingly eager to slay more demons.

With her assistance, the battle became completely one-sided. Though three demons escaped into the river with severe injuries, the rest were annihilated.

Wolf Fang Island's defensive formation collapsed without further resistance.

Without needing orders, Ma Wu and the others led Qi Refinement disciples in clearing the island of lesser demons. 

With countless minor demons present, indiscriminate slaughter was impractical—some were enslaved, others executed. Array disks were then deployed to fully secure the island.

Meanwhile, Gu Yuan ascended alone to the island's peak, where a pool of crystalline spring water awaited.
