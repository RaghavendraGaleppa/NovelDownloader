# Chapter 87: The Modified Empress, Night Visit to Ying Bing's Room

"She possesses peerless beauty, elegant and otherworldly, recognized as a fairy by the martial world."

"She holds a revered status, decisive in killing, and single-handedly makes the countless forces of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands tremble."

"Her strength is formidable, her sword light chilling nineteen states."

"She is named Leng Qingqiu, an Empress, also known as the Demoness Leng by the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, for her power is a taboo existence to the entire realm."

With just a few words from Li Mo, the image of an aloof and supreme Empress was vividly brought to life.

Shang Wu thought for a moment and asked suspiciously, "Is there such a person? Why haven't I heard of her?"

Ying Bing also looked at Li Mo, her eyes narrowing slightly.

Li Mo coughed lightly. "I told you, she is a taboo existence, and it was a long time ago. It's normal that you don't know. The Great Shang Dynasty had its own prosperous era, and many legendary figures have since faded into obscurity."

Shang Wu pursed her lips and took a sip of wine. "Fine."

Li Mo continued, "However, a tree that stands out from the forest will be destroyed by the wind. Especially for an Empress like this, who doesn't rely on any force and is uncontrollable, she naturally became a thorn in the side of countless people. To deal with her, the orthodox and demonic paths united to push her to a dead end."

"That day, the sun and moon lost their light, the world was turned upside down, the gods and Buddhas wept, and the ghosts of the night cried. Her palace was a river of blood, mountains of corpses piled high, and countless powerful experts fell. The world was shaken."

"Leng Qingqiu was powerful, but she had reached the end of her rope, forced to the edge of a ten-thousand-foot abyss."

Shang Wu's almond-shaped eyes sparkled, clearly immersed in the story. The thoughtful look on Ying Bing's face grew even deeper. She felt a sense of familiarity. Although the Empress in Li Mo's story had a different name and a completely different experience, some of her encounters resonated with her.

In her previous life, she too was unacceptable to the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Even though she had done nothing wrong, simply focusing on her own martial path and never having any intention of stirring up trouble, the martial world came to her nonetheless. A powerful existence outside of control is enough to be considered a thorn in the side.

However, her ending was different from the Empress in Li Mo's story.

"With no way out, she left only one sentence: 'Even if I die, my heart for the Dao of martial arts will not regret,' and then she jumped into the abyss."

"Ah? What happened then? What happened then?" Shang Wu asked repeatedly. Did the protagonist just die at the beginning? Was it over?

Li Mo smiled softly. "Master, don't be anxious. Think about it, since this secret legend could be passed down, how could the protagonist have truly died? To be honest, this secret legend was left by Leng Qingqiu herself. At the moment of her death, she activated a strange object called the 'Spring and Autumn Cicada'."

"So! Not only did she not die, but she also returned to her youth!"

Little Li's storytelling was immersive, with a strong sense of substitution. These words were particularly impactful.

Shang Wu: "!"

*Clatter—*

This was the second time today.

In a moment of distraction, Ying Bing dropped her chopsticks.

Shang Wu curled her lips. "Little Bing'er, you also find it too shocking, right? How could there be a thing in the world that can bring the dead back to life? And... this isn't just about resurrection, it's about reversing time itself!"

The most insurmountable thing in this world is life and death. The most heartless thing is time. Countless legendary figures and supreme experts have ultimately been defeated by time, unable to transcend the bonds of life and death.

"Transcending life and death, reversing time... How could that be possible?" Shang Wu's voice grew wistful.

"Perhaps... it is possible."

Hmm?

Shang Wu couldn't help but turn around. Where did Little Bing'er's sense of identification come from?

Seeing that Ying Bing was taking the story to heart, Li Mo felt a sense of relief. Then he looked at Shang Wu with some exasperation. "Master, if you interrupt again, I'm not going to continue."

"Alright, alright, you're the storyteller, you're in charge." Shang Wu poured him another cup of wine, signaling that she would listen quietly and not argue.

After all, it was a legend. Who knows how much of it is true or false? As long as it's interesting, that's all that matters.

Li Mo took another drink of the Immortal's Drunkenness before continuing to speak. As he spoke in detail, the image of an aloof, otherworldly woman who single-mindedly pursued the Dao of martial arts was outlined.

In this life, using the accumulation of her past life, she rose quickly. But it was this very Leng Qingqiu who, after her rebirth, met a man who had never practiced martial arts by accident. Subsequently, she began to pretend to be an ordinary person, interacting with that man, getting to know him... and finally being moved.

Thus, an Empress had an ordinary husband. Many interesting things happened in between. It was bizarre yet reasonable, and filled with pure, unadulterated sweetness. Moreover, after gaining love, her martial arts progress reached an even higher level.

Li Mo drank the Immortal's Drunkenness as he spoke, becoming more and more engrossed. Under his narration, the plot was full of twists and turns. Shang Wu was completely captivated. Compared to those storybooks and the tales told by other storytellers, this story was on a completely different level. Even though she knew many parts were unreasonable, it was just so... addictive.

"In the end, Leng Qingqiu took her family and retired from the martial world..."

"How can you see a rainbow without wind and rain? *Hiccup~* Although her life was full of twists and turns, experiencing setbacks, and even life and death, she was never defeated. In the end, she achieved a double harvest in both martial arts and love."

Li Mo even added his own commentary. Little Li's meaning was:你看, even life and death can be transcended. After such a tumultuous life, the clouds will eventually part to reveal the sun. Young lady, your life has just begun, why worry about temporary gains and losses? It was uplifting. Our storytelling is all about positive energy.

"That's it?" Shang Wu was left wanting more. She was about to urge Li Mo to tell another story when she found that Mr. Li Mo had already collapsed on the table, emitting a soft snore.

This bottle of Immortal's Drunkenness, Little Li had drunk about a third of it. So after finishing the story, he peacefully passed out from drunkenness.

"Tsk, tsk, when it comes to drinking capacity, you still need more practice with me." There was no choice, Shang Wu had to carry him back to his room. Then, after finishing the last bit of wine, she also went back to her own room to sleep.

"Martial arts and love... a double harvest?" Ying Bing lay on the bed, the scent of a certain person wafting to her nose, and the lingering echoes of that person's storytelling replaying in her mind. For some reason, as the night deepened, she couldn't practice her arts for the time being, and her mind began to wander.

Were the things Li Mo said fabricated, or did they actually happen?

Wait.

Ying Bing suddenly remembered that she still had a system punishment to complete. But... sharing the same bed.

Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed into a knot. Did she have to... secretly sneak into Li Mo's bed in the middle of the night?

This... this...

It was originally nothing. But after just hearing that story, just thinking about the scene made the strange emotions in her heart grow stronger and stronger.

*Creak—*

Suddenly, the door was pushed open. A figure stumbled and fell onto the bed.

Ying Bing quickly dodged, her slender hand already touching the handle of her Frost Heaven Sword. But a strong smell of alcohol assaulted her senses, followed by snoring.

"Mmm... hehe..." The少年 on the bed wriggled a couple of times, as if he were having a sweet dream, still smiling foolishly in his sleep.

It was Li Mo.

Ying Bing stood quietly by the window, but in the darkness, her expression was unclear.

[Ding, the first day is about to end.]

[Please complete the punishment as soon as possible, otherwise the system will unbind.]

[Countdown: 10, 9, 8, 7...]

In the end, a soft sigh echoed in the room.
