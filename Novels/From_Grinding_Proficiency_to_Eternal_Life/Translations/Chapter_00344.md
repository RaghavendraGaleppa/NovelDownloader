# Chapter 344: The Death of a Grandmaster of the Ninth Realm

A whip-like kick, as powerful as a dragon swinging its tail, slammed into the back of the Daoist of Guanshan, sending him flying dozens of zhang and crashing through half a pavilion!

As the dust billowed like a furious storm, Xu Yunfan’s figure remained unmoved within the chaos.

The Nine Profound Dragon-Taming Cane pointed diagonally at the ground. The cane body trembled, faintly emitting the sound of a dragon’s roar. With every breath, visible ripples of air spread out.

He possessed the physique of a supreme martial artist, his bones as tough as cast black iron, and the Dragon Scale Armor was a Grade 8 Divine Weapon. Every single scale pulsed with extreme spiritual energy.

Chu Sheng’s seemingly fierce attacks landed on him like a蚍蜉 (ant) shaking a tree, failing to leave even a trace.

When true energy collided, brilliant sparks flew from the Dragon Scale Armor, yet not even the tiniest crack appeared.

Such defense was beyond the reach of an ordinary Ninth Realm expert.

Chu Sheng and the Daoist of Guanshan struggled to their feet, exchanging a glance filled with disbelief.

Two veteran experts of the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining actually couldn't take down a junior who had just entered the Ninth Realm?!

Moreover, Xu Yunfan’s counterattacks were becoming increasingly effortless!

The Daoist of Guanshan’s expression shifted unpredictably, his gaze fixed tightly on Xu Yunfan.

The ten-extremes true energy surging around him had been tempered to the point of near substantialization, which was truly terrifying.

He swallowed dryly, his voice hoarse as he said, "This boy received the Xuanhuang infusion; how could he be like someone who just entered the Ninth Realm? I fear even the old monster Bi Yuan..."

He stopped mid-sentence, his fingers in his sleeve gripping the long sword tightly. True energy surged, and the sword edge flashed with three more inches of light.

How precious was the Dragon Vein of Great Zhou?

Yet now, it was being forcibly drained like a river flowing backward.

The Daoist of Guanshan looked at the figure on the training platform whose aura rushed to the heavens, his Daoist robes fluttering without wind.

He knew better than anyone how difficult it was to meet the three conditions of "Earth Vein Resonance, Star Alignment, and Physical Body Carrying the Dao."

Yet that madman Bi Yuan had actually dug out such a monster!

"Come again!"

Xu Yunfan laughed, his fighting spirit soaring to the sky. "Today, I have only used fifty percent of my strength so far. Let's see if you can take the next attacks!"

Before the words had fully faded, he charged out again. The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane was like a wild dragon leaving the sea, unstoppable!

Xu Yunfan’s long laugh was not yet finished when his figure exploded like thunder. The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane, shrouded in the violent vortex of ten-extremes true energy, fiercely slashed toward the Daoist of Guanshan.

Before the cane tip arrived, the罡风 (vital wind) had already torn open the blue bricks on the ground. Shattered stones shot out like arrows, forcing Chu Sheng on the side to bulge his veins and sink his waist and hips just to stabilize his body.

The Daoist of Guanshan, facing the heavy cane head-on, changed his expression drastically. He hastily raised his long sword to block. The Dragon and Tiger Pill Qi surged, and the shadows of the dragon and tiger accompanied the sword as they charged forward. However, they shattered like paper the moment the cane edge touched them!

He stumbled backward, the sleeves of his Daoist robe turned to dust by the aftermath of the true energy, revealing his bloodied arms.

"Fifty percent of strength?"

Watching Xu Yunfan ignore him and attack the Daoist of Guanshan first, Chu Sheng could no longer endure it. He roared, and his fists suddenly glowed with a赤金 (crimson gold) light. The烈火 true energy of the Great Sun Glazed Body merged with the True Solar Yang Energy. His fist momentum was like a landslide or a tsunami, aiming straight for Xu Yunfan’s back.

"Arrogant!"

Xu Yunfan didn't even look back. He swept his cane backward in a reverse strike. The cane body collided with the fist, exploding with blinding sparks.

Chu Sheng felt a sharp pain in his fist bones, as if he had smashed them against a ten-thousand-zhang mountain of black iron. Before he could change his move, Xu Yunfan had already used the force to spin his body. His left palm, like a knife, chopped toward the Daoist of Guanshan’s throat!

The Daoist of Guanshan’s pupils constricted violently. Xu Yunfan’s palm-blade turned into a blur in his vision, carrying a piercing vital wind as it bore down on his throat!

He instinctively wanted to retreat, but found that the rebound force from taking the cane head-on still left his legs numb. His Dragon and Tiger true energy was also shaken and scattered.

The Dragon and Tiger Conquest, which the Xuanzhen Sect relied on for fame, was actually as fragile as paper right now.

The crimson golden hue rising from the edge of Xu Yunfan’s palm was a sign that the ten-extremes true energy had been pushed to its limit!

"糟糕 (Bad)!"

He swallowed, trying to open his mouth. The lower hem of his Daoist robe was torn open by the palm wind.

His right arm barely raised half an inch, the long sword moving up, the sword edge trying to emit sword qi to slow down Xu Yunfan’s attack trajectory.

At the edge of his vision, Chu Sheng was stumbling in an attempt to rescue him. The golden-red fist energy of the Nine Luminaries Sect had just condensed but scattered again.

In the split second between life and death, the Daoist of Guanshan suddenly saw Xu Yunfan’s eyes clearly. That was not killing intent at all, but indifference, as if crushing an ant.

Just at this moment.

A cold sword light fell from the sky!

The Penglai Pavilion’s Fairy Yunlan, her white robes fluttering, moved her wrist with her posture. The "Starry Sky Soul-Seeking Bell" wrapped around her wrist trembled lightly. The sword in her hand was extremely fierce, stabbing straight toward Xu Yunfan’s Heavenly Spirit!

This sword strike came without warning. The sword momentum was like the Milky Way pouring down, and the bell sound secretly contained soul-attracting power. An ordinary Ninth Realm expert would be pierced through the head on the spot if they were distracted for even a moment.

However, Xu Yunfan seemed to have anticipated this. He didn't dodge or avoid; he just raised his shoulder slightly to avoid the back of his head, allowing the sword to stab into his left shoulder covered by the Dragon Scale Armor!

"Clang!"

In the sound of metal striking stone, the Dragon Scale Armor splashed a string of blinding sparks. The Dragon Scale scales kept vibrating, spewing out true energy and red mist, neutralizing the sword qi completely.

Fairy Yunlan’s pupils shrank slightly. This sword strike was enough to pierce through Grade 7 armor, yet it didn't even scratch Xu Yunfan’s skin!

"Grade 8 Divine Armor?!"

Penglai Pavilion had a Grade 8 Sect-Preserving Divine Weapon, but a Grade 8 Divine Armor like this was rare in the world.

In the blink of an eye, having硬抗 (hardly taken) a sword, Xu Yunfan’s Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane had already blasted toward the Daoist of Guanshan’s chest!

His expression was cold, and a row of cold white teeth was revealed as his mouth slightly opened.

"Even two more Ninth Realm experts cannot save you."

"No...!"

The Daoist of Guanshan roared and crushed a life-saving jade talisman. A "Nine Mountain Body Protection Curse," exclusive to the Xuanzhen Sect, appeared around him, transforming into nine mountain shadows layered to protect his body.

This jade talisman had been passed down for two thousand years. Nurtured by the spiritual energy of heaven and earth again, it had finally recovered a fraction of its power.

However, wherever the cane edge passed, the mountain shadows exploded like bubbles.

"Crack!"

The sound of chest bones shattering was clearly audible. The Daoist of Guanshan spat blood, his eyes reflecting the approaching cane shadow.

Facing Xu Yunfan’s indifferent gaze, the cane edge pierced through his body!

The ten-extremes true energy was like a wild dragon entering the sea, instantly tearing apart the Daoist of Guanshan’s internal organs.

His Daoist crown exploded, his white hair scattered, and his body flew backward dozens of zhang like a torn sack, crashing heavily onto the stone lion at the edge of the training platform.

The stone lion shattered. The Daoist of Guanshan’s remnant body was embedded in the ruins, his eyes wide open, his vitality shattered by a single cane strike!

"The old bastard... is dead?!"

Chu Sheng’s hair and beard bristled with fury. His fists rained down furiously on Xu Yunfan’s back. "Die!"

He knew clearly that if he didn't fight with his life on the line now, there was absolutely no chance of survival. Moreover, Fairy Yunlan of the Penglai Pavilion was holding her sword nearby, waiting for him to create an opportunity so she could kill Xu Yunfan on the spot.

Fist shadows poured down like a storm. Every strike carried the lethal techniques of the Nine Luminaries Sect. His fists and feet were filled with Great Sun True Gang, burning the air with a scorched smell.

However, Xu Yunfan stood like a reef. The Dragon Scale Armor硬接 (took) thirty-seven punches in an instant, leaving only shallow dents on the armor.
