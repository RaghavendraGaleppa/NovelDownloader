# Chapter 173: Life-and-Death Tribulation

Within the pitch-black clouds, at the edge of a colossal nest, Qin Ming picked up a piece of eggshell. It crumbled in his hand with a mere squeeze, devoid of any spiritual essence.

“Many years ago, could this have been the nest of Golden-winged Great Pengs, or Golden Crows, or perhaps even True Dragons?” he muttered to himself.

The thought of such creatures filled him with awe and dread. Only legendary beings could make their home amidst these clouds.

This abandoned nest held nothing else. The ancient timber used to build it was remarkably sturdy, scorched by lightning but not completely destroyed. Qin Ming searched meticulously but found nothing of value. This was understandable; after all, people from the Outer Lands and Secret Sects had surely discovered this place long ago.

Qin Ming continued along the faded golden spike he had initially followed. Along the way, he saw more and more of these spikes, extending haphazardly. His expression grew solemn, as he became increasingly convinced that these were not spikes at all.

When a lock of his own hair fell before his eyes, a sudden thought struck him: what lay beneath his feet might actually be… long hair. Qin Ming was deeply shaken by this idea. Hair as thick as a water vat? How colossal must the creature be? And for it to float in the clouds without falling was simply unfathomable.

A single strand of this hair could pierce a spaceship. The long hair was intertwined, with a mysterious species having built a nest upon it. All of this combined to leave Qin Ming lost in thought throughout his journey.

“It could also be animal fur!”

He had already traveled several miles along the vat-thick "road," traversing the clouds, finally making a new discovery. He seemed to have reached his destination. Numerous faint golden "long hairs" densely filled the black mist, many of them intertwined. As he drew closer, they became increasingly concentrated.

Undoubtedly, this scene seemed to confirm his suspicions. However, he couldn't see the full picture. What exactly was this creature?

“I cannot tell the mountain’s true form, only because I am within it,” Qin Ming mumbled, quoting an old saying.

Soon, he was astonished to truly discover a majestic mountain.

“What’s going on?” He was somewhat bewildered.

On that mountain, various streams of light, golden mists, and purple fogs occasionally pierced through the thick night mist, clearly indicating an extraordinary place. Qin Ming was lost in thought. He had traveled far on the Vermilion Bird spacecraft, crossing the night sky. How had he encountered a mountain in the clouds?

As he arrived at the base of the mountain, he saw numerous faint "long spikes" crisscrossing and intertwining, supporting the entire mountain.

“Could this be a meteorite that fell onto the body of an enormous creature?” Qin Ming mused.

The mountain's material was peculiar, pitted with craters, from which various luminous mists continuously emerged. Su Shiyun, Zhao Yaoting, and the others had already appeared on the mountain. They had spread out, each using their wondrous artifacts to absorb the purple mist, golden mists, and other energies. This was clearly their "mission" for this expedition. The seniors from the Outer Lands and Secret Sects had given them "special tutoring," "feeding" them individually.

Qin Ming hurried forward. He realized that the seven individuals possessed higher cultivation than him, at least starting from the Second Great Realm, allowing them to travel much faster. He discovered that not only did various streams of light emerge from the mountain's crevices, but some special areas also grew strange plants. However, these places were all protected by flashing silver runes, seemingly preventing anyone from approaching.

He ascended the mountain quickly, dazzling lights appearing everywhere. Nearby, a fragrant scent permeated the air. A silver vine, resembling metal and gleaming brightly, bore bowl-sized flowers that swayed in the strong winds. Dozens of meters away, golden mists rippled around a three-foot-tall sapling that glowed faintly. Unfortunately, they were all protected by special symbols.

"High above, amidst the clouds, there's actually a mountain, cultivating unknown plants," he thought. He didn't need to ponder much; everything here was undoubtedly priceless. Otherwise, it wouldn't be jointly managed by the Pure Lands, Immortal Lands, and Secret Sects. What was true heritage? This was it—a "land" in the sky, capable of producing rare herbs and fruits.

Qin Ming sighed, feeling how far behind he was. He couldn't even afford a small room in an earthly city, not even with a single day's earnings.

He quickly found a spot and began absorbing the flowing light. As the last to arrive, he naturally wasted no time, immediately executing his "mission" by simply charging in.

“This is high-grade Heavenly Essence!” he immediately deduced. The mountain in the clouds was closer to outer space, and over long years, it had accumulated many rare spiritual essences.

Qin Ming noticed that everyone else was far more efficient than him, as they all possessed wondrous artifacts. He thought of his tattered cloth and figured he could make use of it. However, this piece of cloth had a serious problem: it only absorbed and never "returned" anything. Most crucially, he tried to analyze the cloth's mysterious ability and found that it only amplified his Heavenly Light Energy, and not even by a great deal. For example, when he injected Heavenly Light to activate the golden setting sun pattern on the tattered cloth, it merely felt as if his fist had grown a few sizes. Qin Ming was starting to feel that it wasn't worth "nurturing" it.

Ultimately, he held his nose, a hint of disdain on his face, and took out the tattered cloth, stuffing it into a glowing pit. Normally, it was unremarkable and showed no activity, but when it encountered divine or spiritual essences, it instinctively absorbed them to repair itself. It was like a bottomless pit, sucking all the luminous substance from the pit dry.

Qin Ming meticulously searched and found a spot emitting purple mist. He grabbed the tattered cloth and immediately rushed over, determined not to feed it this time. He opened his mouth and inhaled, and immediately, purple mist ascended, entering his mouth and nostrils. In an instant, he felt utterly refreshed, all his pores opening wide. He knew that if this purple cloud mist was Heavenly Essence, it must be of an extremely high grade!

Qin Ming collected all the purple mist from this pit, still unsatisfied. He placed his hand into the pit, using his Heavenly Light Energy to probe, checking if there was more within the mountain itself. At the same time, he restrained himself from activating his Purple Mansion Thunderflame, not wanting to perform "internal refinement" of a great medicine in a place like this.

“Indeed, there’s more!” Qin Ming exclaimed joyfully. He used his Adhering Force to pull out several large clumps of purple energy, carrying an auspicious aura, and absorbed all of them into his body. He meticulously searched. There were still other areas on the mountain emitting purple mist, and upon finding them, he immediately rushed over. During this, he saw golden mists rippling and felt they were also rare spiritual essences. Naturally, he didn't hold back and absorbed them completely.

"Absorbing various essences from beyond seems to make my body feel even more comfortable!" Qin Ming felt it was excellent. His Purple Mansion Thunderflame stirred restlessly, wanting to "internally refine" again. He had found the correct internal refinement method: igniting "earth fire" with "heavenly thunder."

Whenever Qin Ming saw glowing substances, he would immediately rush to absorb them. Unless it was ordinary Heavenly Essence, which he would feed to the tattered cloth. This place truly was a blessed land for him! Qin Ming searched the entire mountain for essences from beyond, absorbing and containing them purely with his physical body.

Eventually, he felt somewhat "stuffed" and began to consider the tattered cloth again. In truth, what Qin Ming most desired was the liquid formed from Heavenly Light from beyond. On this mountain, being closer to outer space, it theoretically should exist. However, he searched for a long time but found none.

The mountain was vast. Su Shiyun, Sun Jingxiao, Leng Feiyue, and the others had spread out as much as possible, keeping a considerable distance from each other. Qin Ming naturally didn't approach them, to avoid any misunderstandings.

Not long after, he found where the Heavenly Light was. It was coiling around the roots of the strange plants. He directly inhaled a mouthful of the night mist. This truly was a "land" floating in the sky!

Soon after, he spotted an old woman, clad in jade armor, carrying a five-colored bottle. She had just poured a small amount of Heavenly Light liquid onto a fiery red sapling.

“Child, are you looking for Heavenly Light liquid?” she asked with a kindly smile. Her hair was white, her body withered and slightly hunched, as she came around from the other side of the mountain.

Qin Ming was startled. There was actually someone here, tending to these plants. She must be a Jade-Armored Guard, someone from the Third Realm! The Newborn and Outer Saint realms often had many youths, but from the Third Realm, "Spirit Field," onward, young people were rarely seen. This path was peculiar; a difference of one great realm could make two people appear like two generations, grandparent and grandchild.

Qin Ming remained calm, nodding reservedly. This was certainly not the time to panic.

The old woman murmured to herself, “Strange, this place is jointly managed by the Outer Lands and Secret Sect. How could a Newborn be allowed to absorb essences from beyond?”

“Do you want to check? The eight of us booked the place, and we came together,” Qin Ming said, taking out his boat ticket.

The old woman smiled, then walked toward him, saying, “It seems your talent is exceptional; you must have been favored by a near-immortal seed and specially permitted to enter.”

Qin Ming vaguely sensed her malice. This old woman was exceedingly dangerous. He stepped back, saying, “My elder is outside. Perhaps you’d like to meet them with me.”

“Good!” The old woman smiled and nodded, slowly following him.

Qin Ming understood. This was serious trouble. Being targeted by an old hag from the Third Realm was an extremely grave problem. As soon as he reached the vat-thick "road," he instinctively wanted to leap down.

The old woman smiled gently, “Don’t jump down, child. You must believe that if an elder in the Spirit Field realm unleashes their power, you will shatter the instant you leap. My life spirit field and Heavenly Light are enough to tear you apart.” She no longer concealed it; her malice was evident.

“My elder is right outside. What do you intend?” Qin Ming stared at her.

“A false elder, but the true you,” the old woman smiled and shook her head. Then she added, “Hmm, we’ve left the mountain now, so we won’t alert anyone else.”

“Senior, we are all cultivators walking the Newborn path. Why go this far?” Qin Ming asked.

The old woman simply smiled, “Don’t be nervous.”

Qin Ming remained silent, watching her quietly.

“Young Master…” The old woman grinned, her face filled with an almost benevolent expression. This address sent shivers down Qin Ming’s spine.

“Young Master, relax. Our meeting here is a good thing,” she said, holding the five-colored bottle containing Heavenly Light liquid. “You want it? I’ll give it to you. However, it cannot be consumed directly. Only the spiritual fruits nourished by it can be eaten.”

“You people are truly persistent, I meet you even here!” Qin Ming’s face darkened. To address him as "Young Master" with such malice, apart from *that* family, there was likely no one else.

The old woman chuckled, “Indeed, what a coincidence. It’s been years. I’m protecting fields in the sky, and yet I still meet Young Master. This is truly an unexpected joy.”

Qin Ming had no impression of her and guessed she wasn’t from the Cui family’s direct lineage.

“You’re from the Cui family, a thousand-year-old aristocratic family, yet you serve as a Jade-Armored Guard for the Outer Lands people, and work so hard here?” Qin Ming asked casually, searching for an opportunity to escape.

The old woman shook her head. “Serving as a Jade-Armored Guard for my own family’s direct lineage prodigy is nothing. My Cui family’s status in the Outer Lands Pure Land is not low. And how is coming here hard work? This is such a good place, beneficial for cultivation—many people beg for such an opportunity.” Then she smiled, “We’re all family. Come back. Everyone says your talent is extraordinary. Perhaps you’ll get a chance to be a Jade-Armored Guard for the true Young Master Chonghe.”

This was not the first time Qin Ming had heard such words. Cui He and Cui Shuning, who had lost to him in the *Verdant Wood Scripture*, had said similar things, which had greatly repulsed him. Now, hearing it again, he felt an extreme aversion.

The old woman shook her head. “Qin Ming, are you perhaps too arrogant and conceited? You are just a Newborn. Your future prospects are dim. Being given a chance to follow Young Master Chonghe, you should be content. His path is smooth, his advancement rapid, and he will eventually become near-immortal. While you are an anomaly, in the end, you will probably just waste away your years, unable to keep up with his pace.”

“Shut up!” Qin Ming said coldly. At his current low realm, he didn’t want to say too much. On the path ahead, it was still uncertain who would go further.

“Youth is just spirited. What a great opportunity. If you had just come back peacefully, there wouldn’t have been so many problems,” the old woman shook her head. “Unfortunately, you don’t cherish it.” She then continued, “I heard you’re asking about your grandfather? I can tell you.”

Qin Ming said, “Speak.”

“Bow your head and soften up,” the old woman said with a smile, slowly walking closer.

Qin Ming lowered his head, calmly looking at her. The old woman’s expression wasn’t particularly pleased; the height difference between them was significant, and his lowered head made it seem like he was looking down on her.

“Tell me, what about my grandfather?” Qin Ming asked in a low voice.

“Your attitude is not good,” she said coldly.

Suddenly, thick Heavenly Light erupted from her body. Yet, a small sword, pure white as jade mutton fat stone, pierced through the light screen, touching her glabella. Blood splattered.

At this moment, both were shocked. At such close range, Qin Ming used the special ability born from his Sixth Rebirth, unreservedly activating the small sword forged from extraordinary metal, which specialized in breaking Heavenly Light. Yet, it failed to pierce through her. The old woman was horrified and aghast. Although she hadn’t advanced an inch since stepping into the Spirit Field realm, remaining in the early stage of the Third Realm for over a decade, her cultivation was deep, far surpassing his. Yet her forehead bone was pierced, and blood flowed!

Qin Ming felt this was his life-and-death tribulation. Without any delay, the abilities from his Seventh Rebirth erupted. The old woman’s Heavenly Light and Life Spirit Field also roared.

With a dazzling flash of light, both of them fell from the faint golden “hairs,” plummeting from the clouds. In the dark night mist, large amounts of blood splattered.
