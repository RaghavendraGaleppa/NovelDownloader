# Chapter 530: The True Lord's Summons

Bi Yuan said with deep emotion, "Yunfan, you now bear a heavy burden on your shoulders. We have become something of a drag on you."

Xu Yunfan felt a slight awkwardness in his heart. His main concern was not to let his trump cards be known to the outside world. He couldn't help but force a dry laugh and said, "Master, you are too serious."

He cleared his throat with a couple of dry coughs to gloss over the topic and continued.

"The name of Zhenwu is now a thing of the past. From this day forth, this peak shall be renamed Shenxiao Peak."

Xu Yunfan continued, "Senior Bi, I will have to trouble you to take charge of guiding the disciples on the peak to switch their cultivation. Wu Yan, Chen Tiezhu, and the others will be personally taught by you the fundamentals of the true scripture. Xue Zhen, Qingming, Old Mud, and Senior Madam, I must trouble you all to assist and answer the disciples' questions."

"As the Peak Master commands!"

The crowd responded in unison.

These people were all old and cunning; they naturally understood that they were now relying on Xu Yunfan.

Although the Pure Yang Ancestor was still alive, he was far away at the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and was a Golden Core True Lord of the Sword Sect. Every move and action of his was under scrutiny. If they were to rashly go to him, it would be of no use other than adding to the trouble.

The gloom of the future had been dispelled, and they had been bestowed with a supreme true scripture. The future of Zhenwu—no, Shenxiao Peak—was already promising.

Of course, these were matters for Bi Yuan and the others, along with the entire...

The following three months saw the entire peak plunged into an orderly yet frenzied storm of transformation.

Beside the massive Black Tortoise statue, the towering stele bearing the name "Zhenwu Peak" was completely erased. In its place were the three large characters for "Shenxiao Peak," branded with Shenxiao True Essence and surrounded by crackling lightning. The characters were majestic and imposing, carrying the thunderous might that could shatter all laws.

This was personally carved by Xu Yunfan.

On the peak, the dark palace complexes had many of their eaves corners wreathed in subtle Shenxiao lightning. The walls of the halls began to be inscribed with simple Shenxiao runes, and the air gradually filled with a faint yet vast aura of heavenly thunder.

On the training grounds, the past shouts of exertion were replaced by low, resonant chanting of scriptures.

All disciples, whether inner or outer, regardless of their previous cultivation progress, were under the guidance of Bi Yuan and his core team. They held their breath, focused their minds, and devoted themselves to cultivating the introductory chapter of the *Shenxiao Jiuchen Xuanqiong Bumie Zhenjing*.

Some disciples were reluctant to part with their previous cultivation progress and were unwilling to switch. Xu Yunfan did not force them.

Everyone was from the Primordial Origin Sect; having self-awareness was a good thing, and they were all talents. It didn't matter what they cultivated. In the end, if they couldn't repay their loans, a portion of their value would simply be collected from their bodies.

Xu Yunfan would have liked to be more refined and noble, to express that he was not willing to do such things. But being in the Primordial Origin Sect and under the watchful eyes of the Peak Masters of the other peaks, he had to follow local customs. It was a difficult situation for him too.

As for those who wanted more profound cultivation methods or even techniques for artifact refining, well, I'm truly sorry, but you'll have to provide Contribution Points.

You don't have any?

Then go complete sect missions to earn them, or you can take out a loan.

In any case, there were many ways; he wasn't worried about these talents lacking sources of income.

Xu Yunfan did not interfere much in the specific affairs.

Most of the time, he remained deep within his cave dwelling. On one hand, he was stabilizing his own foundation and sorting through the gains and insights from the battle at Cold Crow Pass.

On the other hand, he was waiting for the next arrangement from Qingyuan True Lord.

As Chu Chengnan had said, in the chess game of a Golden Core True Lord, a Foundation Establishment cultivator is merely a valuable pawn, temporarily unable to jump out of the rules of the board.

Qingyuan True Lord had instructed him to return to the Primordial Origin Sect within three days to await orders, so Xu Yunfan naturally could not leave the sect easily.

Although there had been no response up to this point, Xu Yunfan was also clear that he could be summoned at any time.

The only thing that surprised Xu Yunfan was that after he returned to Shenxiao Peak, the Peak Masters of the other peaks seemed to have received the news as well. Originally, there had been many disciples from the Hundred Desires Peak at the foot of the mountain, but now not a single one remained.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a little helpless. He had wanted to take the opportunity to have a chat with the Hundred Flowers Peak Master. The Hundred Desires Swallowing Yuan Great Method was extremely excellent. If it were cultivated to a profound level, and then he were to cultivate the advanced true art, the *Heaven and Earth Interchange Yin-Yang Separation and Union True Scripture*, he wouldn't just be limited to dual cultivation with men and women.

He could truly cultivate with the heavens, the earth, and the very air itself.

How could the art of dual cultivation be such an inconvenient thing?

As an auxiliary cultivation method, this true art was also an excellent path. Xu Yunfan naturally had his eyes on it.

Now, with his own cultivation level and the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend from the Zhenyuan Temple, he had already refined a perfect Shenxiao foundation.

This true scripture corresponds to the nine supreme celestial palaces of the Divine Firmament above, and forges the indestructible golden body of the Dark Vault below for battle.

It could be said to be a perfect integration of offense and defense, near and far.

Three months of time passed in a flash amidst Shenxiao Peak's hectic schedule of transformation and reconstruction.

On this day, Xu Yunfan was sitting quietly in his cave dwelling, contemplating how to refine the nascent form of a grotto-heaven from the *Shenxiao Zhenjing* and how to go to the Nine Heavens' Gang Clouds to harvest thunder qi.

Suddenly, a faint yet familiar voice pierced through the layers of restrictions and sounded by his ear without any warning.

*'Come immediately to Qingyuan Mountain, at the Purple Bamboo Monastery.'*

"It's finally here..."

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes. The vast spiritual power within his body slowly retracted, and a flash of lightning flickered in his eyes. The thick, dark clouds that had been lingering above his cave dwelling, with their intermittent flashes of lightning, gradually dispersed.

He rose to his full height, straightened his flawless Daoist robe, and with a calm expression, stepped out of his cave dwelling.

Without disturbing anyone, Xu Yunfan transformed into a streak of purple lightning divine light. He shot up from the ground instantly, breaking through the cloud barrier outside Shenxiao Peak, and headed straight into the vast sea of clouds in the core region of the Primordial Origin Sect.

The nine immortal mountains of the Primordial Origin Sect, like nine colossal pillars supporting the heavens, floated above the boundless sea of spiritual clouds. The circulation of rosy clouds and auspicious mist gave it the full appearance of an immortal realm.

Each immortal mountain was like a small, independent world. The immense spiritual pressure was held in check, yet it felt grand and vast.

Qingyuan Mountain was one of them.

From afar, the entire immortal mountain was shrouded in a deep, cold, azure halo. The mountain's terrain was steep and craggy. On the cliffs and precipices, clouds and mist swirled, creating a scene like a fairyland.

The moment he entered the range of Qingyuan Mountain, an invisible guiding light fell upon Xu Yunfan, pulling him through the thick layers of spiritual clouds.

Upon entering the territory of Qingyuan Mountain, the spiritual energy became exceptionally pure and refreshing, carrying a profound sense of vastness.

Throughout the mountains, purple jade-like spiritual bamboo could be seen everywhere. They were tall and straight, their leaves shimmering with a metallic, cold light. They were as fine and dense as needles, moving without wind. When they struck each other, they produced crisp, metallic chimes, converging into a natural melody of restrictions that cleansed the mind while subtly containing a killing aura.

Following the winding jade staircase upwards and passing through the layered, hidden sea of purple bamboo, the view suddenly opened up.

A flat, open platform at the mountain's peak stood a monastery.

There were no courtyards or partitions within the monastery, only a single hall.

The hall doors were wide open, and the interior was exceptionally spacious and simple.

The ground was also paved with deep purple, jade-like spiritual bamboo, polished so brightly it could reflect a person.

Inside the hall, there were no enshrined statues of deities, nor any ornate decorations. Only on the high platform at the very back was there an ancient-looking meditation mat, also carved from purple bamboo.

The top of the great hall was not a conventional roof structure but was hollow and open to the sky. Through the enormous skylight, one could see the complex star charts flowing in the firmament, composed of countless talismans and Daoist patterns. Threads of starlight and pure Daoist rhymes, connected to the Heavenly Dao, were channeled down.
