# Chapter 193: Oh No, Is My Persona About to Crumble?!

Since the existence of Hengyun Sword City, the Sword Mark that accompanied the mysterious stone had been erased?

The Sword Mark... well, now it could only be called the Strange Stone.

Everyone stared at the Strange Stone, their eyes vacant and minds blank.

This Strange Stone had a mysterious origin.

Even a Xuan Sage of the Seventh Realm could not leave the slightest trace upon it.

That Sword Mark was even more formidable, spanning through the ages, rising and falling with the tides of Hengyun Sword City; even time had failed to grind it away even slightly.

Yet, such a thing had been accomplished by a mere Cultivating Spirit practitioner.

No wonder there had been such a commotion just moments ago.

Looking at the girl standing alone there, the elders were speechless for a moment, not knowing how to describe their feelings.

"The Sword Mark has been ground away..."

Huang Donglai, his back drenched in cold sweat, quickly pulled out a booklet titled *The Laws of Martial Survival*.

He crossed out the first line on the first page, 'Never act on impulse,' and changed it to 'Never provoke Ying Bing.'

"She..."

Cao Mu’s expression was complex for a moment, then he suddenly let out a relieved laugh.

Haha, he actually thought about getting revenge one day?

He was so foolish. Truly.

"Old Bai."

"Hmm?"

Bai Jinghong turned back from his daze.

He saw Wu Chushu staring blankly, his hair disheveled into a chicken's nest.

"I suddenly... don't feel like practicing the sword anymore. Tell me, how can the gap between people be so much bigger than the gap between people and dogs?"

"......Why are you insulting dogs?"

"Huh?"

"Haha, just lightening the mood."

Bai Jinghong had grown; he had learned to find joy in bitterness.

Wu Chushu said, "They might as well just award her the Sword Hero title directly."

"Not that it's impossible..."

Bai Jinghong opened his mouth, but a scene suddenly surfaced in his mind.

Inside the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, he had seen it clearly.

The girl who now seemed as mysterious and serene as a celestial fairy had once stood behind a man, shielded by him from the wind and rain.

*That* man was right here on the scene.

Bai Jinghong couldn't help but look to the side.

"Sister Bing... is so amazing."

The light in Jiang Chulong's gray-white eyes seemed to pierce through the cloth bandages.

While she was pleasantly surprised, she felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity.

Sister Bing's understanding of the Sword Dao... why does it have a hint of the Teacher's style?

Could it be... that the Teacher... also guided Sister Bing?

The Teacher is so amazing...

The little Princess Jiang, who believed the Heaven尊 Teacher was the ultimate supreme being, didn't find anything wrong with this.

"I'm used to it. I'm completely used to it."

Li Mo was no longer that little boy who hadn't seen the world.

Did they even know what kind of existence the Empress of the Phoenix was?

If she didn't cause a bit of a stir, would she even be the Ice Cube?

".....Looks like I won't be having a scandal."

Li Mo let out a sigh of relief.

Hmm, great kindness doesn't need words of thanks, but I must reward the Ice Cube properly to show my appreciation...

"Miss, what... what did you comprehend?"

Elder Zeng rubbed his hands, representing the elders to ask.

The elders, all of whom were advanced in years, felt a bit embarrassed.

According to the rules, the prodigy who stood out was supposed to leave behind their insights after contemplating the Strange Stone.

This was a mutually beneficial exchange.

But now, this group of old men didn't dare say that they could remain calm and unmoved by that sword technique.

"I will leave a copy of my insights regarding this sword technique."

Ying Bing nodded lightly.

So what if someone else could actually learn it?

"Good!"

"As expected of you!"

"Truly a fairy descended to the mortal world. Given time, you will surely rank first among the Prodigies! Perhaps even first on the Heaven List!"

"I declare, from this moment on, anyone who has a problem with Miss Bing has a problem with our Sword City!"

The old men and women laughed until their faces crinkled.

The scene was quite bizarre.

Numerous强者 who suppressed entire provinces were frantically flattering a young girl who had just entered... no, she was already at the second aperture of the Cultivating Spirit realm.

But looking at the girl they were praising, it didn't seem entirely unreasonable...

"Miss Bing becoming the Sword Hero of this session is actually an honor for the title of Sword Hero..."

***

"Um... is there a possibility..."

Li Mo raised his hand. "That we haven't感悟 yet?"

The Elders: "......"

Oh, right.

They got a bit carried away.

But what if the Strange Stone lost its divine effect now that the Sword Mark was gone?

It was hard to say whether this was a blessing or a curse...

The elders went to check on it. After a moment, they put down the Strange Stone and the heavy stone in their hearts.

"Although the Strange Stone no longer has the Sword Mark, its divine nature remains."

"Yes, it can still be used for comprehension."

"It seems the miracle of the Strange Stone does not depend on that Sword Mark."

One elder speculated, "But rather, if someone comprehends a stronger martial art from it, they can leave their own imprint?"

This说法 was quite reasonable.

That is to say, if Ying Bing was willing, she could completely leave the Sword Mark she had just comprehended on the Strange Stone again.

Elder Zeng pondered for a moment and nodded.

"Let's finish the Martial Arts Summit normally first, then ask Miss Ying Bing to try."

The summit was still ongoing.

The people below had been waiting for a long time, but there was no movement from above.

So.

Zhong Zhenyue and Huang Donglai, who had yet to comprehend, stepped up one by one.

Elder Zeng skipped over Ying Bing and directly announced their insights:

"Zhong Zhenyue, comprehended a top-grade upper-level martial art, the 'Eight Gates Golden Lock Spear'!"

"Huang Donglai, comprehended a complete top-grade upper-level martial art, the 'Cloud-Chasing Body Technique'!"

...

In the past, this would have been enough to become the talk of the martial artists and various forces present.

After all, such a young genius possessing such insight.

However, everyone now seemed difficult to stir up any waves, and were more curious about Ying Bing's insight.

"I still need to comprehend."

Li Mo thought to himself.

After all, what he comprehended, outsiders probably couldn't tell, they could only see the grade.

He had plenty of martial arts of various grades.

Later, if he comprehended a hammer technique, he could just find a sword technique of the same grade to substitute.

Hengyun Sword City didn't delve too deeply into this.

As long as the grade matched.

For example, Zhong Zhenyue, the spear technique he comprehended was no one in the Sword City would practice, so he exchanged it for a top-grade sword technique.

Not long after.

Li Mo was the only one left who hadn't finished comprehending.

Our Li Sword Immortal exchanged a glance with Ying Bing, and after receiving the little Princess Jiang's encouragement, he coughed lightly, supported himself with the Chixiao Sword, and strode over.

Simultaneously, he told himself in his heart:

"Be spirited, we are the best, don't lose face!"

He walked before the Strange Stone.

That strange attraction pulled at his spirit.

The closer he got, the more extraordinary this object seemed.

"It's a pity I still can't draw it completely."

This thought flashed through his mind.

Li Mo released his soul intent and entered it.

He felt everything around him seemed to dissolve and retreat.

In a daze, he found himself standing on a vast, ancient land.

Above his head, thousands of stars revolved ceaselessly, as if each star contained a hazy world.

This land was even more ancient and heavy, as if it were the center of heaven and earth.

*Rumble—*

In his confusion, Li Mo heard thunder amidst the chaos.

The starry sky changed unpredictably.

He looked up at the starry sky, and instinctively, he grasped his most reliable support—Eighty.

Inspiration struck, and realization surged. Various moves evolved in his mind.

This was not controlled by his will.

The rumbling sound resounded powerfully in his mind:

"Heaven发s calamity, moving stars and changing constellations!"

Along with this realization.

In his haze, an inexplicable obsession arose in Li Mo's heart:

"Oh no, my persona is still going to crumble."
