# Chapter 99: Captured

Li Shiming was organizing the items delivered by Qiu Tan, sending large quantities of mundane metals to the underground space. He arranged the formation materials in his cave dwelling while storing the three spiritual herbs in his storage pouch.

From today onward, he could begin practical research on formations. After many days of continuous exchanges with Yin Shilan and repeated consolidation of formation knowledge through IBMz15, his theoretical understanding had reached an exceptionally high level. Otherwise, Yin Shilan wouldn't have frequently consulted him with questions. In terms of theory, his skills were almost on par with hers, and in computational abilities, he far surpassed her.

With the three spiritual herbs secured and his cultivation having advanced to the fourth level of Qi Refining, he could feel the blood contract between himself and the copper corpse strengthening significantly. The corpse's resistance had vanished—it now fully acknowledged him as its master.

Unfortunately, this copper corpse wasn't one he had raised from scratch. According to the *Profound Nether Corpse Refining Manual*, if a corpse could be refined into a lifebound corpse from the very beginning, the difference in cultivation levels between the corpse and its master could span an entire major realm. However, the conditions for creating a lifebound corpse were extremely stringent. Even within the Profound Nether Sect, few cultivators possessed one.

The primary requirement was that the corpse had to possess considerable strength before refinement—its physical constitution, spiritual power, and internal spiritual energy had to exceed those of the cultivator refining it. In other words, the corpse used as material for a lifebound corpse had to belong to someone stronger than the cultivator while alive. Additionally, the refining process had to begin immediately after death, as the corpse would lose energy with every passing minute.

The success rate for refining a lifebound corpse was much lower than for ordinary corpses, mainly because the corpse often couldn't survive the initial stages of refinement. As for the basic materials needed, Li Shiming already had a complete set among his spoils of war.

According to the *Profound Nether Corpse Refining Manual*, nearly every cultivator who practiced it desired to obtain a lifebound corpse. Li Shiming shook his head, dismissing the fantasy. Acquiring this copper corpse was already an incredible stroke of luck. Ordinary corpse materials required corpses with single or dual spiritual roots, while lifebound corpse materials absolutely had to be from single-spiritual-root individuals.

A fully developed single-spiritual-root cultivator was almost always a top-tier genius within their sect. Killing such a genius and having enough time to calmly prepare the corpse for refinement was exponentially more difficult than refining an ordinary corpse.

Li Shiming stepped out of his cave dwelling and approached the spirit bamboo. A second stalk had grown, meaning he could soon produce spirit paper. Of course, he wouldn't sell the paper—selling talismans would be far more profitable. If he could acquire more powerful spells in the future, learn them, and then craft them into talismans, he would have another avenue for earning spirit stones.

When Baili Jinyan was still some distance from Eagle Beak Island, he stowed his flying boat and suppressed his aura, skimming the sea's surface as he approached. Normally, only Foundation Establishment cultivators could fly freely, but some Qi Refining cultivators with strong spiritual power and mastery of the *Object Control Technique* could manage short-distance flight.

Baili Jinyan's secret technique was even more formidable—as he neared Eagle Beak Island, not a trace of his presence could be detected by the defensive formation. He arrived right beside the island, separated from land only by the formation.

With a hint of regret, he retrieved a talisman. It wasn't that he lacked a formation-breaking talisman, but using one on such a low-level defensive formation seemed wasteful. Moreover, he had only brought this one with him, and once used, he would have to return to his sect to replenish it.

In truth, he could easily shatter the formation with a single strike. However, Eagle Beak Island was too close to the Nine Peaks, and breaking its formation would alert the Heavenly Sea Sect. Additionally, Baili Jinyan wasn't entirely sure how close Li Shiming and Yin Shilan were. If their relationship was intimate, the sect might pay extra attention to protecting the island.

Wasting a formation-breaking talisman would avoid trouble with the Heavenly Sea Sect and, more importantly, prevent Yin Shilan from connecting Li Shiming's disappearance to him. The talisman transformed into a red light that settled onto the formation. Strangely, the formation offered no resistance as the red light seeped in, forming a passageway.

With a faint smile, Baili Jinyan flashed through the opening and entered the island. Eagle Beak Island was small enough to take in at a glance. He spotted Li Shiming standing before the spirit bamboo.

At that moment, Li Shiming received a warning from IBMz15. Without hesitation, he activated his Blazing Flame Sword. But before the sword could travel more than a meter, Baili Jinyan appeared beside him with unbelievable speed.

Though IBMz15 allowed Li Shiming to see Baili Jinyan's movements clearly, his own reflexes couldn't keep up with his thoughts and vision.

---

Baili Jinyan placed a hand on him, sending a surge of terrifying spiritual energy into his body and suppressing his spiritual vortex. "Entry-level body refinement, just barely reached the fourth level of Qi Refining—how could someone like you achieve this?" Baili Jinyan snarled, instantly assessing Li Shiming's condition.

From the barren spirit fields, the sparse spiritual plants, and a quick scan of the cave dwelling, Baili Jinyan deduced that Li Shiming was far from wealthy. Moreover, Li Shiming was only seventeen years old with a triple-spiritual-root aptitude—details Baili Jinyan confirmed the moment he touched him using a secret technique.

At this age, with such mediocre talent, Li Shiming had already reached the fourth level of Qi Refining while also cultivating body refinement techniques. If Baili Jinyan had only believed thirty percent of the rumors he'd heard on Longming Island, now he was convinced of most of them.

Baili Jinyan was certain that without Yin Shilan's help, Li Shiming—with his triple-spiritual-root aptitude—could never have achieved such progress by seventeen. While Li Shiming's strength was nothing to a prodigy like Baili Jinyan, the latter had grown up with immense resources, a powerful background, and a single spiritual root. The two were incomparable.

Baili Jinyan didn't want to kill Li Shiming outright. Instead, he produced a rope that coiled around Li Shiming like a serpent, binding him tightly. From the moment Baili Jinyan appeared to the moment Li Shiming was completely subdued, the latter had only managed to summon his Blazing Flame Sword—a feat made possible only by his mastery of the *Sword Control Technique*, renowned as the strongest sword art in the Qi Refining stage.

Once subdued, Li Shiming immediately stashed the corpse pouch into his machine room space and swapped his ten-cubic storage pouch for a five-cubic one. The smaller pouch contained only basic items like fasting pills, while all important belongings remained in the machine room space—a dimension linked to his soul, unaffected by his sealed spiritual energy or restrained body.

He was still puzzled. Where had this cultivator come from, and why had he captured him? The pressure emanating from Baili Jinyan was overwhelming, far surpassing even that of Senior Brother Zhuji during the new disciple orientation.

But Li Shiming had no intention of surrendering. Stashing the corpse pouch was his way of keeping a trump card.

Darkness enveloped his vision as something covered his eyes. Then he felt himself being carried away from Eagle Beak Island at incredible speed. After precisely thirty-one minutes and sixteen seconds—timed accurately by IBMz15—the movement stopped.

Baili Jinyan arrived at a deserted island. With a wave of his hand, a sword light shot out, carving a simple cave dwelling into the rock. This would be his interrogation site. He placed a formation disk at the center and activated it, enveloping part of the cave in a white, cocoon-like barrier.

Grabbing Li Shiming, Baili Jinyan stepped inside. He was meticulous, leaving no room for escape. Removing the blindfold, he watched as Li Shiming's eyes adjusted to the light—or so it seemed. In reality, IBMz15 was unaffected, gathering data through Li Shiming's senses.

In that short time, Li Shiming learned more than Baili Jinyan could have imagined. The space contained a formation that shielded both its interior and exterior. Once inside, no one could enter or leave for a short period. His casual glance at the formation disk allowed IBMz15 to record its intricate patterns, which he later analyzed.

"Your name is Li Shiming, correct?" Baili Jinyan asked elegantly, sitting on a wooden chair and looking down at Li Shiming, who was seated on the ground. He toyed with Li Shiming's storage pouch, forcibly breaking into it with his powerful spiritual sense to retrieve the identity jade token.

Thanks to the formation's isolation, he didn't have to worry about the Heavenly Sea Sect tracking the token's location—something that would normally be possible within the sect's territory, especially for someone with sufficient authority like Yin Shilan.

Baili Jinyan hadn't left the sect's domain. Its territory was vast, and he still intended to meet Yin Shilan. Disposing of Li Shiming wouldn't interfere with his plans.

"Who are you? Why did you capture me?" Li Shiming countered while assessing the rope binding him. The rope was a magical tool designed to restrain cultivators, sealing both movement and spiritual energy. For most Qi Refining cultivators, escape would be impossible. But Li Shiming wasn't most cultivators.

His machine room space allowed him to store anything in contact with his body, regardless of his physical or spiritual restraints. The rope was no exception. However, he waited for the right moment to act, knowing Baili Jinyan's overwhelming strength demanded caution.

"Answer my question!" Baili Jinyan produced a thin needle and drove it into Li Shiming's arm. Excruciating pain erupted from the puncture site, causing Li Shiming to convulse.

"Damn it, he's using my interrogation method!" Amid the agony, a strange thought crossed his mind. He had once used extreme pain to extract confessions, though his medical techniques were far less brutal than Baili Jinyan's needle—a magical tool designed to inflict unbearable pain, typically used in combat to incapacitate foes.

To his surprise, Li Shiming found himself enduring the pain better than expected. Part of his consciousness remained in the machine room space, dulling the sensation. Though his body neared its limit, his mind remained clear.

After twenty seconds, Baili Jinyan withdrew the needle. "Name?" he demanded sharply.

"Li Shiming," Li Shiming replied promptly this time.

"Look at you. How could someone like you be worthy of Fairy Yin? A triple-spiritual-root trash like you—only a metal-attributed heavenly spiritual root like mine is fit for her!" Baili Jinyan sneered, reveling in Li Shiming's submission.

Li Shiming froze. Finally, he understood why he'd been captured. It was all because of Yin Shilan. Of course—someone of her caliber would naturally attract suitors willing to eliminate rivals.

"But you seem like the loser here," Li Shiming suddenly taunted.

"You're asking for death!" Enraged, Baili Jinyan sent the needle plunging into Li Shiming again, relishing his writhing and screams. "After you die, I'll extract your soul and seal it in a soul banner. You'll watch as Fairy Yin and I become inseparable!" he cackled madly.
