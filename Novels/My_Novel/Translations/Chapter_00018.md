# Chapter 18: Forcing a Purchase of Tiger Blood Pills and Slapping Zhao Han

The time for the guards' assessment competition was approaching, and Jiang Yun wanted to advance further to become a top-tier guard.

News that Li Xian had obtained Tiger Blood Pills spread like wildfire and soon reached Jiang Yun.

She thought to herself, "Tiger Blood Pills can strengthen the body and generate blood. With the help of this pill, I will have a much greater chance of success in the guard assessment competition."

She immediately went to find Li Xian and got straight to the point, wanting to buy the pills.

"Sorry, I'm not selling," Li Xian replied apologetically. He was polite but not humble.

"Not selling?" Jiang Yun narrowed her eyes. "You're just a lowly bottom-tier guard. Taking a Tiger Blood Pill would be a complete waste. Are you sure you won't sell? I'm willing to offer five hundred copper coins."

Zhao Han whispered, "Uh... Miss, a Tiger Blood Pill... costs at least seven hundred copper coins, right?"

The words had barely left his mouth when two sharp slaps rang out, "Pa! Pa!" Zhao Han's cheeks immediately swelled up. Jiang Yun had struck him twice without a moment's hesitation.

Her movements were incredibly fast; Li Xian didn't even see how she did it.

Zhao Han was left dizzy and disoriented, almost falling to the ground. Jiang Yun looked at him with disgust. "What does the value of a Tiger Blood Pill have to do with you? Do you think I don't know that?"

She then stepped forward aggressively. "Are you selling or not?"

Li Xian shook his head. "Sorry, I'm not selling."

"You're not afraid I'll slap you too?!" Jiang Yun said coldly, her energy already gathering in her palm.

"If you want to slap me, then go ahead. I can't beat you right now, so I'll accept it. If you want to rob me, you can do that too. I can't beat you right now, so I'll accept that as well."

Li Xian's tone was calm.

But... he would not compromise. He would make her pay for this tenfold in the future.

"Good for you,小子 (brat)," Jiang Yun said through gritted teeth, momentarily at a loss for what to do.

How could she not want to snatch it?

But if she snatched the Tiger Blood Pill right after Commander Pang Long had bestowed it, it would be far too brazen.

Seeing that she was about to leave empty-handed and furious, Jiang Yun was about to strike and teach him a lesson when she saw Li Xian's calm expression, showing no fear at all.

A sudden idea struck her. She stopped aiming for Li Xian and instead slapped Wang Chun and Zhuo Yilie. The sound of "Pa, Pa" rang out as she gave each of them four slaps.

Her speed was so fast that by the time she retracted her hand, the two of them were only just beginning to feel the searing pain on their faces.

"Remember this," she said. "This beating is because of him."

"If you dare tell Commander Pang about what happened today, I will come and practice my palm technique on you every single day."

Jiang Yun strode away, casting a vicious glare at Li Xian.

She was deliberately trying to drive a wedge between the four of them.

"This woman... her schemes are so vicious," Li Xian frowned with concern. "Eldest Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother, are you guys alright?"

"We're... we're fine," Wang Chun forced a smile.

"No, we're not!" Zhao Han wiped his tears.

He wasn't crying, but the intense pain on his cheeks had stimulated his eyes, causing tears to well up.

"This woman's 'Emerald Silk Palm'... she's actually perfected it," Zhao Han said resentfully.

"'Emerald Silk Palm'?" Li Xian asked.

"It's a low-tier martial art. It's more than ten times more powerful than basic martial arts; its power and effects are completely different. The energy cultivated from this art is extremely insidious and vicious," Zhao Han explained, touching his cheeks. His eyes were bloodshot, and his expression looked somewhat terrifying. "If I'm not mistaken, before long... our three faces will become even more swollen."

"The energy from the Emerald Silk Palm will linger in our flesh and blood. Eventually, it will form permanent palm prints..."

"If we can't dissolve that energy, brothers... we'll be disfigured."

Li Xian felt a pang of guilt. "Is there a way to dissolve it?"

"There is!" Zhao Han said with a bitter smile. "Get that Jiang Yun to dissolve it for the three of us. Make her reverse her energy and slap us a few more times. But... is that even possible? Jiang Yun is notoriously cruel."

Wang Chun covered his face. After realizing the severity of the situation, his expression became strange. "Or... maybe we can..." He trailed off, and a heavy silence fell.

Li Xian knew what he meant.

Jiang Yun had appeared suddenly with the goal of getting the Tiger Blood Pills. As long as Li Xian obediently agreed to sell them to her, everything might be resolved.

Li Xian clenched his fists and looked at Zhao Han and the others. Their cheeks were swelling up, already the size of a fist, making them look like pigs' heads. In a little while, their appearance would be even more horrifying.

The silence of the three men spoke of their inner struggle.

"If we tell Commander Pang, is there a way to solve this?" Li Xian asked.

Zhao Han shook his head. "There are hundreds of guards in the One Union Manor. We're all martial artists. In daily life, there are conflicts and friction, but Commander Pang doesn't get involved in any of it."

Martial artists should have spirit and shouldn't be restrained too much.

Pang Long valued rules above all. Since the rules were like this, he would definitely not intervene.

There was no way forward. Li Xian thought to himself, "They treated me well and were only standing up for me, which is why they suffered this disaster for no reason."

"If it were just me, I wouldn't care if I was beaten with a stick. But implicating them is truly not what I want."

Seeing their wretched appearances, Li Xian let out a soft sigh and chased after Jiang Yun in the direction she had gone.

He hadn't gone far when he indeed saw Jiang Yun's figure. Li Xian frowned and called out in a deep voice, "You want the Tiger Blood Pills, right?"

Jiang Yun was sitting on a tree branch, knowing that Li Xian would come. She gave a faint smile. "I don't want them anymore."

"Unless you get on your knees and beg me to buy them. Then I might, out of the goodness of my heart, reluctantly agree to purchase the Tiger Blood Pills."

Li Xian stared at Jiang Yun, his brows furrowed and his eyes narrowed.

Moments ago, out of concern for his friends, he had indeed considered giving up the Tiger Blood Pills. However, upon seeing Jiang Yun again, he changed his mind.

Selling the Tiger Blood Pills for the sake of Zhao Han and the others would be a display of loyalty, and there would be nothing to criticize.

But some things cannot be obtained by begging and showing weakness.

If he knelt and begged now, selling the Tiger Blood Pills for a low price, would Jiang Yun definitely help him and heal the injuries of Zhao Han and the others?

Not necessarily!

The possibility was extremely small. Because she had the ability not to keep her word!

"The weak kneel and beg for mercy."

"The strong fight on bravely."

"Selling the Tiger Blood Pills might bring a moment of peace. But what about tomorrow? What if Jiang Yun, in a bad mood, slaps us again? What then?"

"Instead of that, I might as well find a way to get the Emerald Silk Palm, practice it to perfection, and help Zhao Han and the others dissolve the energy!"

As Li Xian's thoughts raced, his gaze gradually became resolute.

He said, "Since you don't want the Tiger Blood Pills, then that's just as well. Let's part ways here."

He turned and left.

Jiang Yun was stunned for a moment, staring at Li Xian's back, her eyes透出 a dangerous glint.

This小子, is he just having integrity, or is he just selfish?

Under the shade of a tree, Zhao Han and the others used their sleeves to hide their faces, revealing only their eyes.

Seeing Li Xian return, they tried to ask in a calm tone, "Fourth Brother, how did it go?"

Li Xian shook his head. "The deal didn't go through."

"It didn't go through?" Zhuo Yilie paced back and forth anxiously. "How could it not go through? We took these slaps for no reason, what are we going to do now?"

"Third Brother..." Zhao Han said calmly, "This isn't Fourth Brother's fault. It's that woman who was too ruthless."

Though he said this, Zhao Han knew it was true, but he couldn't help feeling a certain way about it. A subtle change occurred in the atmosphere between the four of them.

Li Xian said, "Don't worry, I'll find a way to help you recover. That Emerald Silk Palm... where can it be learned? Does Commander Pang have it?"

Zhao Han's mind was in a mess, and at this moment, he didn't really want to pay attention to Li Xian. But he still said, "The martial arts in our manor are all coarse and superficial things that fall from the fingertips of the Madam."

"The Emerald Silk Palm is a palm technique recorded in the 'Leisure Martial Pavilion,' which is under the charge of the Madam's personal maid, Qiu Yue."
