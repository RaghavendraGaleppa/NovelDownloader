# Chapter 31: Top-Grade First-Class Cave Abode

The Inner Affairs Hall fell into a brief silence as the proud scions of various cultivation families turned their gazes toward the bamboo slip token in Qi Chuan's hand, their eyes filled with both astonishment and envy.

The inscription "Top-Grade First-Class" indicated that Qi Chuan had successfully drawn a cave abode at the level of a top-grade first-class spiritual vein. Meanwhile, everyone else had only managed to obtain mid-grade first-class abodes.

This person's luck was simply too good. Which cultivation family did he come from? The Qi Family?

"Isn't that the Qi Family's rising star?" someone murmured.

On the other side, Ye Liang observed Qi Chuan with a faint glimmer in his eyes. All those present were from cultivation families, and since these families maintained connections with one another, they generally knew which family each person belonged to, though not necessarily their exact identities.

For instance, someone like Ye Liang, who possessed exceptional talent and considerable fame, was recognized by many. However, individuals like Qi Chuan—previously unknown but suddenly securing an inner sect position—were unexpected even to their own families, let alone outsiders. Thus, most only knew he was from the Qi Family but not his specific background.

"Probably just a lucky fellow who happened to draw a top-grade first-class cave abode," Ye Liang thought, narrowing his eyes slightly before looking away, no longer concerned.

While a top-grade first-class cave abode was indeed superior to a mid-grade one, cultivation ultimately depended on one's spiritual roots. Ye Liang possessed upper-third-grade spiritual roots—the highest among the gathered scions—and as a member of the Ye Family, he lacked no resources. Minor differences in cave abode spiritual energy were negligible.

Moreover, though Qi Chuan appeared younger, Ye Liang could vaguely sense that his cultivation level was inferior. With his superior spiritual roots, the gap between them would only widen over time.

"I'm only sixteen and already at the fifth layer of Qi Refinement. Once I reach the late stages of Qi Refinement and a vacancy arises for a true disciple position in Fengyue Sect, I'll undoubtedly compete for it. These so-called prodigies from cultivation families are merely at the third or fourth layer—hardly worth my attention, let alone a mere difference of one cave abode grade."

With that thought, Ye Liang completely dismissed any lingering reservations.

"To think I actually drew a top-grade first-class cave abode?" Qi Chuan stared at the bamboo slip token in his hand, genuinely surprised.

He had assumed all inner sect disciples would only receive mid-grade first-class abodes. It seemed the red dots in the sand table artifact represented top-grade first-class cave abodes, but their rarity meant most had drawn the blue mid-grade ones.

"This top-grade first-class cave abode should significantly boost my cultivation speed!" Qi Chuan mused.

Back in Red Maple Valley, the spiritual vein at Second Elder's independent mountain residence was likely only a low-grade first-class at best. Even mid-grade first-class cave abodes were reserved for elders at the late Qi Refinement stage. As for top-grade ones, the entire Qi Family probably only had one—occupied by the family head, Qi Wuyou.

Now, upon entering Fengyue Sect, Qi Chuan had secured cultivation conditions on par with the Qi Family patriarch.

He returned the bamboo slip token to Elder Zhao Jing of the Inner Affairs Hall, who rubbed it between his hands, causing a beam of light to fly out and land on a red dot atop a mountain in the sand table artifact—presumably marking Qi Chuan's new cave abode. He then received a cave abode token.

As he held the token, Qi Chuan noticed several envious glances from those around him. Even among these proud scions, a top-grade first-class spiritual vein cave abode was a coveted prize. Most cultivation family lands were only mid-grade first-class at best, and even their most talented members rarely received high-grade accommodations.

Ignoring the attention, Qi Chuan focused on Elder Zhao Jing's subsequent instructions. After assigning cave abodes, the elder outlined other arrangements.

From his explanation, Qi Chuan learned that as an inner sect disciple, he would receive an annual stipend of fifty low-grade spirit stones. However, he was also required to complete at least three sect missions per year, which would reward him with contribution points. Opting out of missions required resource payments, though some mandatory tasks couldn't be skipped.

Moreover, joining the inner sect wasn't a permanent privilege. Disciples who failed to reach the late Qi Refinement stage by age thirty would be demoted to outer sect status, assigned as stewards to external sect businesses, or even expelled. Those who advanced to late Qi Refinement could remain in the inner sect until age fifty.

These rules ensured the inner sect maintained a manageable size. As for ascending to true disciple status, vacancies had to arise—either when a true disciple advanced to Foundation Establishment and became an elder or when one relinquished their position. Fengyue Sect had twelve true disciples, and vacancies triggered selection trials among inner sect members.

"It seems becoming a true disciple isn't something I can rush," Qi Chuan reflected. "But my current cultivation is still too low anyway. With my hundredfold multiplier, true disciple status—even Foundation Establishment—is inevitable. No need to hurry."

Unlike others who had to fiercely compete for every opportunity, Qi Chuan could afford patience thanks to his cheat ability. Missing chances wouldn't doom him to stagnation.

"Alright, that covers everything. Head to your cave abodes now, and don't forget your sect missions," Elder Zhao Jing concluded, dismissing the group.

With their cave abode tokens in hand, Qi Chuan and the other young cultivators set off for their new residences. Upon leaving the Inner Affairs Hall, Qi Chuan carried not only his cave abode token but also his inner sect identification token, disciple robes, and other essentials. Notably absent were any free spirit stones, artifacts, or talismans—even the annual stipend wouldn't be disbursed until the year's end.

"Joining the inner sect means resources still depend on personal effort. The real advantage lies in the status itself, which can be leveraged for opportunities. But with my cheat, I just need steady effort."

Shaking his head, Qi Chuan followed his token's directions to a picturesque mountain. A narrow path led him to a cliffside clearing, where his top-grade first-class cave abode was nestled.

Standing at the cliff's edge, he gazed at the boundless Fengyue Lake below, its surface veiled in mist. In the distance loomed the silhouette of a colossal mountain—Moon Shadow Mountain, one of Fengyue Sect's famed peaks.

"They say the Mystic Sword True Monarch resides atop Moon Shadow Mountain," Qi Chuan murmured, studying the summit briefly before turning his attention back to the misty lake.

"The scenery is exceptional. This cave abode offers both stunning views and abundant spiritual energy. The only drawback is the travel time—Fengyue Sect is vast indeed."
