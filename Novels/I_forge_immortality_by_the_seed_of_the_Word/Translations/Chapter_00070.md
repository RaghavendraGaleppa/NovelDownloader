# Chapter 69: Return to the City, Demon Attack  

At a stone cliff upstream,  

The snow-white deer, Thirty-Eight, burst forth from the water, its hooves immediately treading upon the wind as if galloping through the void, charging upward at lightning speed.  

On its broad back,  

Zhang Jing sat comfortably, his eyes filled with satisfaction.  

This fellow hadn’t lied to him—it could traverse both water and wind, and its speed was astonishing.  

The best part was that no matter how Thirty-Eight ran, its back remained incredibly stable, without the slightest bump. Truly a natural-born mount.  

Now, Zhang Jing had no desire to ride the spirit crane anymore.  

That thing was far too cramped, and its back was uncomfortably hard, nowhere near as spacious and soft as Thirty-Eight’s.  

But if he rode Thirty-Eight, what would happen to the spirit crane?  

Their speeds were worlds apart. If the crane fell behind, it might get lost.  

Wait—  

Zhang Jing glanced around and suddenly realized that Thirty-Eight’s back was spacious enough to accommodate the crane as well.  

"Thirty-Eight, could you let the spirit crane also—" he began tentatively.  

But before he could finish, his voice abruptly cut off.  

"Where’s my spirit crane?"  

Zhang Jing stared blankly at the empty cliff.  

He distinctly remembered ordering the crane to wait here.  

But now, where was it?  

He took out the black bracelet used to control the crane from his storage pouch, only to find its spiritual light had dimmed significantly.  

Dead?!  

His gaze involuntarily shifted to a pile of black ashes nearby, from which a faint burnt smell still lingered.  

Instantly, the faces of the deceased Senior Gou and the gray-robed man flashed through his mind.  

No doubt about it.  

The culprit had to be one of them—most likely the gray-robed man.  

"How many Dao Merits am I going to owe the Thousand Techniques Pavilion for this?" Zhang Jing couldn’t help but lament, his earlier joy from acquiring the spirit herbs and mysterious treasure completely evaporated.  

"Master, what are Dao Merits?"  

Thirty-Eight’s large head leaned in, its big eyes blinking with curiosity.  

"They’re my lifeblood," Zhang Jing muttered gloomily.  

With a light leap, he landed gracefully on Thirty-Eight’s back and found a comfortable spot to lie down.  

"Thirty-Eight, let’s head back to Langya County City first."  

"Master, where is Langya County City?" Thirty-Eight’s voice was filled with confusion.  

"Just fly straight in this direction," Zhang Jing said weakly, pointing vaguely ahead.  

---  

"Understood, Master."  

With a direction in mind, Thirty-Eight didn’t hesitate. It leaped high into the air and galloped away on the wind.  

As it ran,  

It seemed to realize something and suddenly emitted a gentle spiritual light that enveloped Zhang Jing, who was resting with his eyes closed.  

"Thirty-Eight, aren’t we flying a bit low? Can we go higher?"  

After observing for a while, Zhang Jing couldn’t suppress his concern. He pointed at the ground, less than five zhang below them, and asked quietly.  

Throughout the journey,  

He had noticed that while Thirty-Eight’s wind-treading speed was impressive, its altitude left much to be desired.  

Everywhere they passed, the ground below was thrown into chaos.  

"Master, I can go higher," Thirty-Eight flapped its ears and replied sheepishly, "but... I’m a little scared."  

"You’re afraid of heights?"  

Zhang Jing nearly thought he’d misheard.  

This was the first time since entering the world of cultivation that he’d encountered a creature afraid of heights—especially one that was half a step into the late Qi Refining stage.  

"Go up. I’m here—what are you afraid of?" Zhang Jing said calmly.  

"Yes, Master."  

Obediently, Thirty-Eight trembled as it ascended higher.  

In no time, the scenery below shrank to the size of ants, and mist swirled around them.  

Stealing a glance downward,  

Thirty-Eight felt a sudden urge to relieve itself.  

---  

Langya County City, North Gate.  

Since the demon uprising began, few mortals had ventured here.  

The once-flat ground outside the city gates had been plowed over and over, crisscrossed with deep and shallow trenches. The lingering remnants of spiritual energy and demonic aura clashed chaotically.  

Only a winding path remained for passage.  

On the road,  

The passing cultivators seemed accustomed to the sight, paying no attention as they went about their business.  

Meanwhile, atop the city wall,  

Two men in green robes chatted leisurely.  

"These past few days, far fewer cultivators have been coming to the demon battlefield—not just from our sect, but even the rogue cultivators too."  

"Ah... the storm is coming," the man on the left sighed with a complicated expression.  

"The demon uprising is about to end."  

"What a shame. Who knows when we’ll get another chance like this to earn Dao Merits so quickly?"  

The man on the right sounded regretful.  

"Let’s hope there isn’t a next time. Have you seen how many have died in this demon battlefield?"  

"By the way, that talisman shop on Shuangfeng Street is still open. Why don’t we pool our resources and exchange some demon cores for talismans these last couple of days? One final haul?"  

"After this, we might never get such a good deal again."  

"Exactly—"  

As they spoke,  

Thud—thud—  

"Any demon activity at the North Gate today?"  

A gruff voice suddenly rang out, accompanied by heavy footsteps.  

"Senior Brother, nothing today."  

The moment they heard the voice, the two men straightened up and answered solemnly.  

"Good. Report immediately if anything happens."  

"Understood, Senior Brother."  

Only after the footsteps faded did the man on the left wipe the sweat from his brow and complain, shaken:  

"Senior Brother Luo always shows up out of nowhere and scares me half to death."  

"What’s he so worried about? Aside from the initial attacks, what demon would be foolish enough to assault Langya County City now, with so many cultivators gathered here?"  

"Right? Don’t you think—?"  

To his surprise, his companion didn’t respond.  

Puzzled, he turned to look.  

The other man was trembling, pointing ahead with a horrified expression, his throat working soundlessly as he managed to choke out:  

"Looks like... there really is one!"  

At these words,  

The man on the left froze, then slowly turned to follow his companion’s gaze.  

A massive white deer had appeared in the distance, descending rapidly from the sky.  

Though still far away,  

He could already faintly sense the formidable aura radiating from it.  

"Go get Senior Brother Luo!" he stammered.  

No sooner had he spoken than a burly figure materialized beside them.  

"No need to call. I’m here."  

Meanwhile,  

Below the city gate,  

The cultivators coming and going had already noticed the approaching demon and were in chaos.  

Senior Brother Luo stared fixedly at the charging deer, his magical hammer trembling slightly in his grip.  

A demon with an aura close to the seventh level of Qi Refining—this was no friendly visit!  

"You two, leave now. And make sure the people below the gate evacuate as quickly as possible—the farther, the better. Don’t let them get caught in the crossfire."  

He issued the orders gravely, his gaze never leaving the deer.  

"Yes, Senior Brother."  

"Understood, Senior Brother."  

As the demon deer drew nearer, Senior Brother Luo’s sense of danger grew stronger.  

He took a deep breath.  

The spiritual energy in his dantian stirred, gathering for a decisive strike.  

---  

Before long,  

The deer landed like a meteor, kicking up a cloud of dust.  

Now’s the chance!  

Senior Brother Luo’s eyes lit up.  

He channeled all his spiritual energy into the hammer and hurled it with a secret technique.  

Locked on—no escape!  

The hammer left his hand, transforming into a streak of golden light that crashed toward the deer with overwhelming force, aiming to crush it into paste!  

Feeling the power of this strike, Senior Brother Luo allowed himself a faint smile.  

The next moment—  

BOOM!  

A deafening explosion erupted, and the shockwave cleared the dust, revealing the scene within.  

Silence fell over the city gate.  

Senior Brother Luo’s smile stiffened.  

Layers of icy-blue spiritual light had formed a barrier in front of the deer, now covered in cracks.  

His hammer, imbued with all his power, lay on the ground, its glow extinguished.  

Blocked? How is that possible?!
