# Chapter 50: Life and Death Decided  

Despite his efforts, Yang Fan's strength proved insufficient. Relying on the [Shattered Jade Pendant], he managed to sever one of the giant ape's heads, but the attack drained most of his energy.  

When he unleashed a second sword beam, he was already on the verge of exhaustion. The weakened strike was easily blocked by the ape.  

With one head destroyed, the great ape was severely wounded. Fearing Yang Fan might still have reserves, it summoned four massive arms and struck at him with brutal force.  

Just as the ape committed to its attack, a streak of golden light silently streaked across the sky. Hidden among the barrage of attacks from other cultivators, it slipped past the ape's arms and appeared behind its remaining head.  

In the next moment, Han Yue materialized from the golden radiance. Clutching the [Taiyi Mystic Light Divine Talisman], he unleashed its immense power directly upon the ape's last head.  

The supreme divine might of the top-tier sect, Tai Xuan Sect, erupted forth—  

**[Taiyi Mystic Void True Light]!**  

A thick beam of ethereal light pierced straight through the ape's skull.  

Everything happened in the blink of an eye.  

From Han Yue's daring strike to destroy the ape's second head, to the ape swatting Yang Fan away, to Han Yue transforming into light to escape—it all unfolded too quickly for anyone to comprehend.  

Now, Yang Fan lay buried in rubble, his fate unknown. The ape, with both heads destroyed, stood motionless, its arms limp. Han Yue hovered in the distance, poised to attack or flee.  

Through their combined efforts, Han Yue and Yang Fan had succeeded in beheading the great ape.  

The cost? Yang Fan was grievously wounded, and Han Yue had expended his newly acquired third-rank divine talisman.  

This was yet another miraculous battle where the weak overcame the strong—a tale that would surely spread throughout Gui Zhou.  

But just as everyone thought the tide had turned, the towering ape stirred once more.  

Four of its six arms curled protectively around its head, shielding it completely.  

Only then did the onlookers realize—the ape hadn't just grown a second head.  

Though it had only recently advanced and lacked sufficient mana and full mastery of its abilities, it had already begun forming a third head—albeit a much smaller one.  

Tucked between the two larger heads was a tiny, underdeveloped skull.  

This was what had saved the ape's life.  

Now, with its arms wrapped tightly around its sole remaining head, the ape no longer dared expose it.  

Badly wounded, the great ape began to retreat, roaring furiously as it lumbered toward the outer territories.  

At its command, the demonic beasts besieging Fen Rou Ji descended into even greater frenzy, launching more violent assaults.  

By now, Fen Rou Ji had been nearly obliterated. War artifacts were almost entirely destroyed, and countless cultivators lay dead or injured.  

The settlement could no longer withstand the demonic onslaught.  

To make matters worse, the retreating ape deliberately targeted what little remained of Fen Rou Ji's defenses.  

At this point, Fen Rou Ji was effectively doomed. The only question was how many cultivators would escape with their lives.  

Han Yue hovered in the distance, watching the devastation with rising fury.  

Memories flooded back—the sight of demons feasting on human flesh when he first arrived in this world, the walls lined with cured meat, the young girl who had dashed herself to death before his eyes.  

A surge of righteous indignation swelled within him.  

Deep down, he knew he couldn't stand by and let this tragedy continue.  

If he did nothing, his Dao heart would be tainted, hindering his future cultivation.  

Han Yue, ever the escape artist, always ready to flee at a moment's notice, now found himself at a crossroads.  

Some moments demanded courage. Some battles required standing one's ground.  

For the first time, Han Yue abandoned all thoughts of retreat.  

*You may be a third-rank Sacred Seed, but you're already on death's door.*  

*I may not yet be second-rank, but my divine abilities are boundless.*  

*You slaughtered my kin, destroyed my home, and disturbed my Dao heart.*  

*Today, we decide—life or death!*  

Han Yue channeled all his tempered divine power into his blade.  

Every emotion, thought, will, and intention fused into his spirit.  

His aura peaked—then he vanished.  

Reappearing directly before the colossal third-rank demon, Han Yue merged his spirit with his blade and delivered a single, perfect strike.  

**[Thought-Severing Slash]!**  

A massive blade beam tore through the heavens like a thunderous dragon.  

This slash seemed to cleave the void, shatter illusions, and carve open the path of the Dao itself.  

It severed the ape's sinews, shattered its bones, and extinguished its very existence.  

For a moment, the battlefield fell silent—both man and beast stunned by this world-splitting strike.  

Then, with a thunderous crash, the great ape's body collapsed, gouging a massive crater into the earth.  

Han Yue, drained in body and spirit, barely maintained his flight as he plummeted toward the ruins where Xiao Liu and Fang Yi waited.  

That had been the most exhilarating slash of his life.  

From afar, Xiao Liu sprinted toward his falling form like a madman.  

The third-rank ape had been slain, its arms and last head severed.  

Yet as its body fell, a wisp of pale light emerged from its corpse, drifting toward its wounds.  

**[Flesh-Rebuilding Bone]—a treasure of longevity!**  

Among the demonic races, every Sacred Seed and Saintly Scion was granted a life-preserving treasure by their guardian Great Sage.  

Hu Le'er's [Peach God Branch] was one such artifact.  

Naturally, this great ape—possessing both [Heaven-Earth Manifestation] and [Three Heads, Six Arms], two supreme-grade Daoist divine abilities—would not be left unprotected.  

The [Flesh-Rebuilding Bone] originated from the Great Sage [White Slug].  

It could reconstruct flesh and withstand a single fatal blow.  

Now, under its power, the ape's body began to reform.  

Devoid of life, its divine abilities faded, reverting it to a five-meter-tall golden ape.  

As its wounds slowly healed, its body also shrank.  

Soon, it was no larger than a meter-tall monkey.  

Its aura had also weakened—now barely second-rank at best.  

This was the nature of [Flesh-Rebuilding Bone].  

Beyond repairing fatal injuries, it regressed the user's cultivation by one major realm.  

Though seemingly a setback, this allowed the user to re-cultivate without facing new bottlenecks.  

With its third-rank experience, the ape could now refine its foundation even further.  

A temporary delay for greater future strength—a treasure that balanced survival and cultivation.  

But now, stripped of its third-rank power, the ape faced far greater risks.  

Moments later, its body fully restored, the ape awoke. Without hesitation, it burrowed into the earth, using [Earth Evasion] to flee toward the outer territories.
