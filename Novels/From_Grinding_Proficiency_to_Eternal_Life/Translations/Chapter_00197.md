# Chapter 197: Flesh Refinement Realm (Part 2)

‘You...’

A long moment passed.

A muffled thunderclap erupted from Xu Yunfan’s throat, and a mist-congealed arrow of qi shot through the air for thirty meters.

A pigeon-egg-sized qi lump suddenly swelled beneath his ribs, snaking through his muscles and tendons like a living serpent.

Wherever it passed, the muscle fibers twisted and knotted like thousand-year-old vines wrapping around iron pillars. The crimson python bloodline on his back, nourished by the pure yang qi, transformed into wriggling red patterns that spread across his entire body.

A tremor ran through his bones and tendons, suddenly producing the sounds of dragon roars and tiger howls.

The originally separate streams of pure yang internal qi and the python’s coiling mountain force now slowly merged amidst the flow of blood and flesh.

The twenty-four sections of his spine exploded like firecrackers, with every inch of bone seam spewing crimson blood mist.

The two hundred and six bones throughout his body took on the color of gold and iron, while his spine rose joint by joint like an enraged dragon raising its head.

Wherever it passed, his muscles and tendons twisted like old vines coiling around iron, and the python’s coiling mountain force transformed into wisps of blood threads from the core muscle groups of his back, extending beneath his skin.

“Hmm?”

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised.

The pure yang internal qi cultivated from the Pure Yang One Qi Technique was merging with the python’s coiling mountain force.

Or rather, the pure yang internal qi nurtured by the Pure Yang One Qi Technique was merging with the python’s coiling mountain force—this was something he had never expected.

It seemed that by chance, he had stumbled upon the correct way to practice the Pure Yang One Qi Technique.

Before Xu Yunfan could ponder this deeply, a message suddenly floated across his vision:

‘Your Pure Yang One Qi Technique has reached Great Perfection.’

‘You have entered the Flesh Refinement Realm.’

Xu Yunfan’s entire body trembled as large, python-like streams of scalding warmth surged into existence, flooding his entire body.

His muscles and tendons suddenly began to vibrate on their own, his shoulder blades spreading out three inches like eagle wings.

The flesh on his chest and abdomen transformed into fine, scale-like patterns, and when the python’s coiling mountain force circulated, it actually produced the sound of wind and thunder.

The great tendon along his spine suddenly tightened like a full moon bowstring, pulling at every joint in his body to produce thirty-six explosive cracks.

The Yongquan acupoint on his heel suddenly sprayed blood mist, and his toes, like iron plows, tore through his boots and cracked the bluestone slabs beneath him.

The muscle fibers of his arms wove themselves into spirals, and his elbow joints produced clanging, interlocking sounds as they rotated.

The immense force within his body, continuously washed by the warm current, rapidly merged the python’s coiling mountain force with the already formidable pure yang internal qi. A massive amount of newly generated force began to circulate throughout his body, so vast that even his pores could not fully contain it, causing them to spew pure yang qi. Now, mixed with the python’s blood mist, it formed a vital energy barrier three inches from his skin.

Xu Yunfan raised his palm and pressed it forward, unleashing nearly eighty percent of his internal force. A stone weight thirty meters away exploded instantly, and the flying fragments turned incandescent red in mid-air—his flesh and blood force had actually carried the python’s true fire.

The Flesh Refinement Realm allows one to manipulate internal force and strike through the air.

But it was absolutely not like what Xu Yunfan displayed, which resembled the effects of internal energy or true qi. It was mostly due to his extremely formidable physique generating wind pressure with every movement. Xu Yunfan’s palm strike, however, actually possessed elemental attributes.

He felt the force, born from the union of sinews, bones, and skin, penetrate deep into his flesh. Wherever it passed, it brought subtle, transformative changes to his tendons, bones, and skin.

This was more suitable for the power-generating methods of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique. The circulation of force even pushed the body forged by the Hundred-Refined Steel Body to the next level of intensity.

At this moment, a large stream of memories regarding the cultivation of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique began to surface in his mind.

Xu Yunfan suddenly felt a piercing pain at the top of his head. In a daze, he saw himself kneeling on a bluestone cliff.

In the morning mist, a green-robed Taoist’s sleeves fluttered as he pulled the purple dawn from the eastern sky into seven thin threads: “At the third quarter of the Yin hour, press your tongue to the Heavenly Pool, tap your teeth twenty-eight times corresponding to the constellations, and when swallowing qi, visualize the blood and qi vibrating and transforming into a furnace.”

The scene suddenly shifted to the depth of winter. The frost beside him reflected the wind and frost at the corners of his eyes. He was now standing naked atop a snowy mountain peak.

The purple qi from the mouth and nose, like a living creature,钻入 his nasal cavity, causing purple mist to envelop his body—the manifestation of the Purple Qi from the East.

Thirty years...

Feeling the memories of cultivation flooding his mind, Xu Yunfan’s expression became incredibly strange. He had never imagined that in these memories, to cultivate the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, he had practiced tirelessly, spending a full thirty years to achieve Great Perfection.

Xu Yunfan raised his head and straightened his body, his spine crackling.

Flesh Refinement Realm...

Feeling the python’s coiling mountain force rapidly spreading from his back muscles to his entire body with a mere thought, he immediately picked up the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer and began to practice the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique.

Xu Yunfan lightly gripped the hammer handle. The nearly four-hundred-jun Thunderfire Qilin Hammer spun three times at his wrist. As force pulsed from his palm, nine magma-like patterns appeared on the thick handle, spiraling from the base to the hammer head. The trailing flame of thunder and fire from the hammer head hummed in the air, shaking the air currents incessantly.

When his toes touched the ground, his back muscles surged like waves, and twelve python qi forces poured down his spine into the hammer body.

As the hammer shadows danced, he suddenly supported the hammer with one arm in an inverted hook, the hammer head hovering three inches off the ground for half an incense stick’s time.

The dark red hammer body reflected the morning sun with a purple glow. The bluestone ground, rippled by the hammer wind, formed thirty-six ring-shaped depressions.

The final move, “All Mountains Pay Homage to the Ancestor,” should have been a forceful downward劈, but Xu Yunfan instead stepped into the air and casually threw the heavy hammer, turning it into a chain hammer that smashed heavily into the ground.

The entire courtyard, paved with bluestone bricks, seemed to churn like a tide, spreading outward from the point of impact.

*Boom!*

A sound like muffled thunder erupted, and the courtyard was rendered unrecognizable by this single hammer strike.

Every move of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique must be配合 with the Hundred-Refined Steel Body to卸力 and the python’s coiling mountain force to导力. When the hammer fell, his shoulder blades moved like tectonic plates, and the arches of his feet and their tendons rose and fell like dragon veins. The power was extremely fierce and violent, yet it retained a fraction of its force held back to dissipate the impact.

After finishing his practice, Xu Yunfan casually插 the heavy hammer into the bluestone bricks.

As the hammer handle sank into the ground, a visible shockwave of air exploded outward.

A master of the Flesh Refinement Realm, with a burst of force, could lift a ten-thousand-jun bronze cauldron with one arm, and the shockwave from a fist could shatter a cow-sized boulder thirty meters away. Striking a mountain wall with full force would embed a fist print seven inches into the blue rock, with cracks spreading three meters in a spiderweb pattern. With a special technique, it could even trigger a small-scale landslide.

A martial artist of this realm had already transcended the category of a common warrior. In the army, he could tear down a city gate with his bare hands; in the Jianghu, he could cross a great river with his physical body.

However, on the path of martial arts, he had only just touched the threshold of “shedding the mortal coil.” If he were to advance further, exchanging blood and washing marrow, transforming his internal organs, and obtaining a body of gold, jade, and glazed light, he could be called one who has transcended the mundane and entered the sacred.

“Master Xu! The disciples from the Heavenly Craft Department are all complaining bitterly!”

As Fu Li entered, he saw Xu Yunfan’s courtyard had once again been turned into a mess and couldn’t help but complain with a bitter face.

But seeing Xu Yunfan’s face filled with joy, Fu Li’s heart shook, and he subconsciously asked, “Master, have you broken through?”

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly: “I have already broken through to the Flesh Refinement Realm.”

Hearing Xu Yunfan say this himself, a look of wild joy appeared on Fu Li’s face. He couldn’t help but tear up, looking up at the sky.

“Master, if your spirit in heaven can see this, our Casting Hall finally has someone to carry the banner!”
