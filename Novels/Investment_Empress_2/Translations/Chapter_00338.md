# Chapter 338: Why Not Just Become a God Myself?

“Good grief, getting married and having children isn’t something you rush.”

Black lines appeared on Li Mo’s forehead. Although he had lived two lives, he was still only sixteen in this one, and wouldn't turn seventeen for another three months.

“It’s not early at all.”

Wu Qing thought back for a moment.

“The first time I met Feng-ge and gave birth to Xiao’er, I was only a little over a hundred years old...”

By the standards of the Demon Race, a hundred years old was roughly equivalent to a fourteen-year-old human.

“You can’t compare the constitution of demons to that of humans.”

Li Mo waved his hand dismissively.

Shang Qinqing looked at the serious-faced young Li Mo, then at the seemingly indifferent Ying Bing, whose gaze drifted away as if she hadn’t heard a thing, though her lips were pressed tightly together.

*Ice Cube doesn’t quite understand what you guys are talking about.jpg.*

Shang Qinqing couldn't suppress the smile at the corners of her mouth.

“It’s quite common for humans to have children at sixteen in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, but before that, you have to get married first.”

“Elder Shang used to be in charge of weddings. All marriages required the witness of the Azure Phoenix,” Wu Qing affirmed, acknowledging Shang Qinqing’s authority on the matter.

“When you two decide to get married, shall I be the officiant?” Shang Qinqing asked with a beaming smile.

She didn't ask *if* they were planning to get married; she went straight to asking if she should be the officiant. Truly worthy of being the former God of Love of the Great Shang Dynasty! Every strike was lethal, and so subtly executed!

“Ah? This...”

Li Mo opened his mouth to speak, but was immediately stuffed with a dumpling by someone.

Ying Bing withdrew her chopsticks and said softly, “Eat slowly, be careful you don’t bite into a gold bean.”

Shang Qinqing wasn't ready to give up; she wanted to land a big one.

“By the way, I have a set of phoenix coronet and wedding robes. It’s a treasure left behind by the empress of the previous dynasty. Wearing it for a wedding would surely make the bond as strong as gold. Little Bing’er, how about I give it to you to wear when the time comes?”

“That precious?” Li Mo blinked.

Ying Bing brushed a few strands of hair at her temples behind her ear. “Li Mo, are we staying home for the New Year this year? We should bring some specialties from the Southern Border for Uncle and Auntie.”

Li Mo thought for a moment and nodded. “Like bringing some local clothing from the Southern Border?”

Ying Bing’s eyes trembled slightly. “Maybe we should just bring some snacks and tea...”

“......”

Shang Qinqing puffed out her cheeks, looking annoyed.

She hadn't gotten her fix, and she was unhappy.

She was about to speak again, but Ying Bing beat her to it.

“Li Mo, didn't you have something you wanted to ask the Demon Race elders? We shouldn't delay.”

“Right, this is quite important.”

Li Mo clasped his hands together, his expression serious and solemn.

“I’ve heard that many of the Disaster Beasts rely on the power of the faith of living beings. Does that mean as long as there are still people worshipping them, they will eventually revive one day?”

“That is correct,” Shang Qinqing huffed. She felt that although this was official business, it wasn't as important as having children.

“Actually, it’s much better than before. The Disaster Beasts of the past were even stronger. It only improved significantly after the Lord of the South arrived,” Wu Qing explained.

When Wu Qing was young, the Southern Border was basically the domain of Disaster Beasts. That’s why the Ming蛟 (Ming Dragon) clan preferred to risk crossing into human territory rather than stay in the Southern Border. They only came over later after sneezing too much. It was during that time that the Lord of the South came to the Southern Border.

He expanded the territory of the Great Yu Dynasty in the Southern Border considerably and allowed many locals to gradually integrate with the Central Plains. Qingmu City was one such example. Most of the people here no longer revered the Witch Spirits.

---

If Emperor Jingtai had continued to fully support him, the Lord of the South might have expanded the territory even further, and the Disaster Beasts would have been further weakened, or even wiped out.

Unfortunately, things did not turn out as hoped.

Li Mo asked, “Then, can we make people stop worshipping the Witch Spirits?”

“Easier said than done.”

“Exactly. Many of the humans in the Southern Border aren’t as civilized as we are.”

“Then I’ll just become their god myself.”

As he spoke, Li Mo sat up straight, ate the dumpling on Ying Bing’s chopsticks, and swallowed it in one go.

“......”

The large tent fell silent for a moment.

The demons looked at each other, seeing the astonishment in each other’s eyes.

“You want to absorb the power of faith?”

Shang Qinqing widened her eyes. Seeing how serious Li Mo looked, she signaled to Ying Bing.

*Your future husband has gone crazy, aren't you going to do something about it?!*

Ying Bing also frowned.

She knew Li Mo well enough to know he wasn't the type to act recklessly. If he suddenly said he wanted to absorb the power of faith, perhaps he had a plan?

“That power of faith isn't so easily absorbed.”

“Yeah. Although you’d become incredibly strong in the short term, you’d be constantly influenced by the stray thoughts within that power, to the point of becoming a completely different person. And once you lose that faith, you’ll perish along with it.”

“Exactly. Just look at Elder Shang. Don’t you understand the gravity of the situation?”

“?”

Shang Qinqing’s obsession with shipping was indeed justified.

Although she wasn't a Witch Spirit, many people in the Southern Border and even the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands who yearned for love would pray to her.

“Everyone, rest assured. I’m not planning to use the power of faith to boost my strength; I intend to use it for something else.”

“Besides, I have a method similar to the Tree of Marriage that can purify the power of faith. However, the amount left after purification is quite small, so it probably wouldn't be enough to practice with...”

Li Mo didn't hold anything back.

The demons, seeing that his expression didn't look like a lie, finally put their minds at ease.

“I know a shape-mimicking martial art that allows me to transform into other species. If the various tribes of the Southern Border all worship the demon I transform into, they won't be able to provide power to the Disaster Beasts anymore.”

“But how do we make them believe in you?” Wu Qing asked.

The demons were more than happy to see this plan succeed. They would be thrilled if the Disaster Beasts vanished from the Southern Border completely.

Li Mo cleared his throat, imitating the Ice Cube’s cold and aloof expression as if everything were under control.

“That’s where I’ll need the help of you Demon Race elders to cooperate with my performance.”

“Rest assured, I am the First Best Actor of the Golden Statue Awards.配合我的演出, the performance will be flawless!”

“......”

“How do we act it out?”

“It depends on the specific situation. We have to analyze it based on the actual conditions of each tribe.”

Li Mo took out a map.

He was just about to discuss the map with everyone when the bald Peng Demon, Ling Yuan’gou, pointed at the map in confusion.

“Li Mo Mountain... Li Mo River... Li Mo Village?”

“Tsk tsk tsk, that’s some good shipping material. He’s everywhere, so you’ll never get lost, right?”

Shang Qinqing felt the urge to roll around on the ground again.

The demons smiled awkwardly, the corners of their mouths twitching upward.

Not only were they getting dumplings and barbecue, but they were also getting fed dog food.

This trip was truly worth it.

Li Mo: “......”

He took out another map and got back to business.
