# Chapter 165: The Banquet

"You're courting death!" Young Master Chen roared, his face grim, as if Zhou Tian had committed some unforgivable sin against him.

Zhou Tian looked baffled. "I just asked a question, why are you screaming like that?" What he didn't know was that membership cards for Tongtian Company were not easily acquired. Even though the Chen family was a shareholder of Tongtian Company, they were only a minor one. While they had an allocation of a few membership cards, Young Master Chen, being only a collateral relative, was not qualified to obtain one. Therefore, mentioning a membership card in front of him was like touching a raw nerve, instantly sending him into a frenzy.

Li Yuan immediately stepped forward, extending his hand, which glowed, seemingly intending to push Zhou Tian away. However, with a "bang," Li Yuan was sent flying backward, his arm twisted grotesquely, letting out a horrific scream. The two demure maidens instantly rushed over to help Li Yuan up. Young Master Chen's pupils contracted, but being a scion of a noble family, he didn't panic. Instead, he retreated two steps and shouted, "Someone is using force here!"

The use of force was prohibited here, a rule set by Tongtian Company. Not just here, but the entire city forbade the use of force. If anyone resorted to violence, Tongtian Company personnel would emerge to suppress them.

In fact, he didn't need to shout; people were already rushing out from the hall, dressed in uniform, tall and imposing, their vital energy like rising wolf smoke.

"You have violated our rules. Please come with us." One of them, a leader-like figure, stepped forward and spoke to Huangniao. They could naturally discern who had made the move.

"We are from Room 2333." Huangniao replied calmly, ignoring the other party's words.

The leader-like figure paused slightly, his lips moving as if to verify something. A moment later, he bowed slightly and said, "My apologies, we've disturbed you." Then, with a wave of his hand, all the personnel retreated.

"Wait." Just as the leader was about to leave, Young Master Chen called out to him. "I am from the Northern Plains Chen family, and the person injured is my friend." The Northern Plains Chen family represented the Chen family that held shares in Tongtian Company, and Young Master Chen was clearly trying to pressure him.

"This..." A troubled expression flashed across the leader's face. He naturally knew that the Northern Plains Chen family was a shareholder of Tongtian Company, albeit a minor one.

"You can check the information of the owner of Room 2333." Huangniao spoke again, her fair face devoid of any expression.

The leader glanced at Huangniao, and a moment later, his expression changed slightly as he spoke to Young Master Chen, "Young Master Chen, my apologies, but this matter ends here."

Young Master Chen's expression shifted slightly. He knew Room 2333 was merely an Imperial-grade suite; while it could suppress minor incidents, it wasn't enough to contend with their Northern Plains Chen family, unless the room's owner possessed a higher status. Zhou Tian was a little surprised. He hadn't expected Shengmo to have such influence.

Young Master Chen's face flickered between dark and light. A moment later, he let out a cold snort and walked past Zhou Tian, with Li Yuan trailing closely behind, sweat still beading on his pale forehead.

"Have a good trip, my friend!" Zhou Tian didn't forget to rub a bit of salt into their wounds.

Young Master Chen's steps faltered slightly, then he departed at an even faster pace. Smiling, Zhou Tian didn't take the incident to heart. It was just a minor interlude. Even if something happened, Shengmo was there to handle it. They would only worry if Shengmo couldn't hold up anymore.

"Do you want to go to that banquet?" As Zhou Tian was about to continue heading out, Huangniao's voice came from behind him.

"Why do you ask?" Zhou Tian was a little curious.

"Do you want to go?"

"I'd certainly like to, but it's clear some items are needed. Didn't you see we couldn't even press the button..." Before Zhou Tian could finish speaking, he felt a flash before his eyes. A dazzling object, thin as paper and glowing with golden light, appeared in Huangniao's hand.

"An invitation?" Zhou Tian was slightly stunned, exclaiming in surprise. "Did you just get that from that guy?"

"That's right. I don't know why the invitation was on that flunky, but I sensed it in that instant, so I took it." Huangniao replied.

"Huangniao, oh Huangniao, you're quite a dishonest one," Zhou Tian chuckled. "But there must be some measures on it, right? We can't just use it just because we have it."

"There are indeed some, but they aren't too profound. We can solve it by going back to Master." Huangniao replied.

"Alright then, let's go back and find Shengmo. Old folks always say that joyous and somber occasions are good opportunities for socializing, and banquets are pretty much the same," Zhou Tian said. He had originally planned to go out and wander around, but with a banquet right here, it would be a waste not to go. "Hey, Huangniao, tell me honestly, has your master ever done anything perverted to you, like making you change into various clothes?"

"No, I've always viewed Master as my father."

"Tsk tsk, he's a pervert, huh? Shengmo really knows how to have fun..."

After finding Shengmo and deciphering the detection measures on the invitation, the two arrived at the six hundred seventy-second floor. With that invitation, the button that was previously unpressable could now be pressed. As for why Shengmo had such a high status, Zhou Tian had asked about it. It was because his membership card had been given to him by a monk from Luotian Temple, which meant it was a high-grade card with many privileges. This made Zhou Tian increasingly curious as to why Luotian Temple was so good to Shengmo.

On the six hundred seventy-second floor, the banquet hall was vast and resplendent. Chandeliers cast a dreamy glow, and the place was teeming with people. The atmosphere was harmonious, with cups clinking and pleasantries exchanged. Everyone appeared refined and courteous. Regardless of whether they were bloodthirsty killers outside, at least here, they all wore smiles and continuously raised their glasses. The only peculiar thing was their attire. Young masters in suits and leather shoes conversed with saintesses in trailing ancient gowns, giving Zhou Tian a sense of temporal displacement.

Meanwhile, in another room, Li Yuan was kicked flying, slamming into a wall. The maidens nearby trembled in fear, not daring to help him up.

"I was out, so I told you to keep the invitation safe for me, but you lost it!" Young Master Chen roared furiously, all semblance of refinement gone. He was like a wild beast, his eyes cold and severe, an aura of chill permeating the air.

"I'm sorry, it must have been those two who stole it. It was still there when we entered the hotel." Li Yuan knelt on the ground, not daring to look up, speaking with a tremble.

Young Master Chen's eyes turned cold. With a wave of his hand, a blue mist spread, freezing the two maidens, who then turned into ice powder and scattered. "Next time, you'll be them!"

"Yes, yes!" Li Yuan hastily assented.

"Contact my uncle." Young Master Chen straightened his clothes and ordered.

Li Yuan crawled up from the ground, took out a golden disc, fiddled with it for a moment, and a projection was activated.
