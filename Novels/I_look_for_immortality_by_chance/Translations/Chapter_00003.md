# Chapter 3: The Token and Survival  

It was an extraordinarily peculiar sensation.  

The entire world seemed to dissolve before his eyes. The towering, thick stone walls transformed into a mist of gray, and Gu Yuan's vision stretched endlessly, as if it could reach the very ends of the world.  

Of course, this was an illusion. Gu Yuan's sight was far from capable of seeing the world's edge.  

Yet the entire cavern had turned into this gray mist, and everything within the cave was laid bare before his gaze. His perspective elevated, as if he had ascended to a higher dimension.  

Within the gray mist, dots of light flickered in varying hues, silently pulsating with an aura of mystery.  

The most numerous were the white dots, scattered sporadically throughout the cavern's gray mist, densely packed like stars.  

Gu Yuan knew these white dots represented the most basic opportunity for him to escape the Demon Star Cavern—Demon Star Stones.  

After several rounds of experimentation, Gu Yuan had deciphered the stone flask's ability.  

At regular intervals, the flask would produce a peculiar liquid. When applied to his eyes, it allowed him to perceive "opportunities"—or perhaps "methods of survival" or "divinatory insights"—within the surrounding world.  

These opportunities were not random. Instead, they manifested as "solutions" to the most pressing matter in Gu Yuan's heart.  

And the most urgent matter in Gu Yuan's heart was escaping this demonic prison and returning to cultivation.  

The white dots represented the most basic means of escape—Demon Star Stones.  

If Gu Yuan could memorize the locations of these dots and gather enough Demon Star Stones, he could find a way to leave the Demon Star Cavern.  

Beneath his feet, there was also a cluster of cyan light.  

Cyan light signified a greater opportunity than white—specifically, a gathering of thirty Demon Star Stones. With these, he could immediately amass enough to make his escape.  

It was precisely this ability of the stone flask that had allowed Gu Yuan to uncover Senior Brother Yang's scheme and remain vigilant.  

Further away in the gray mist, there had been another cluster of light, hovering between cyan and gray. However, it gradually dissipated, vanishing from Gu Yuan's sight.  

The disappearance of the light indicated that the opportunity had either faded or been seized.  

In this case, it was because Gu Yuan had already claimed it.  

That opportunity had been the "abode" of a long-deceased miner. The miner had apparently been deeply skilled in artifact forging and had used the residual Demon Star Stone ore and demonic miasma to craft a unique "Soul-Corroding Lime."  

This lime could erode spiritual energy, burning into the eyes of cultivators—a vicious, underhanded weapon for assassinations.  

With this, Gu Yuan had a slim chance of killing the Demon Miasma Sect's overseers and escaping.  

But the odds were low, which was why the light had been a mix of white and cyan.  

Opportunities were not set in stone.  

Over the past five months, Gu Yuan had checked multiple times, yet the highest he had seen were cyan dots.  

This made him hesitant to act rashly.  

The probability was too low, too uncertain.  

The Demon Miasma Sect was a demonic faction, known for its ruthless and treacherous ways. Though they had promised the captive miners a way out, who could say how much of that was true?  

Moreover, even if the sect honored their word and allowed defectors to join their ranks, cultivation afterward would hardly be straightforward.  

If escaping were truly that simple, the opportunity wouldn't merely be cyan.  

Gu Yuan didn't know how many levels existed above cyan, but he had a feeling that cyan was not the limit.  

There had to be a better way.  

He was only twenty years old and had spent barely half a year in the mines. He could afford to wait.  

Something told him the Demon Miasma Sect was no place to willingly join—unless absolutely necessary, he would not submit to them.  

Yet after searching for a long time, he still found no other colored dots.  

"It seems… I still have to wait!"  

Gu Yuan sighed inwardly, but there was nothing he could do.  

His vision had limits, and the stone liquid's effects were temporary. Trapped within the Demon Star Cavern, he could only perceive opportunities within its confines.  

The cavern was vast, but finding an opportunity beyond cyan was no easy task. The stone liquid regenerated roughly once a month, and after five attempts, he had found nothing.  

**BOOM!**  

Just as Gu Yuan was about to give up, a furious roar echoed from outside the cavern.  

Accompanying the roar was an overwhelming fire dragon—its massive form blotted out the sky, claws bared, surging toward the cavern with terrifying force.  

"Who dares?!"  

"Who dares trespass upon the Demon Miasma Sect's sacred grounds?!"  

An aged voice thundered from outside the cavern, followed by a tide of black "insects" swarming forth like a net, intercepting the fire dragon.  

**BOOM!**  

The fire dragon, imperious and unyielding, its eyes burning with golden flames, tore through the insect swarm with ease. Its tail lashed out, striking the cavern wall.  

Instantly, the earth trembled, dust and miasma filled the air, and the cavern itself seemed on the verge of collapse.  

"Flame Dragon Sect! You have gone too far!"  

Outside, a black-robed elder with a long white beard bellowed in rage, charging upward to meet the attack.  

**Hummm—**  

Simultaneously, faint runes of a formation flickered to life within the cavern, stabilizing the collapsing stone.  

The Demon Star Cavern was saturated with demonic miasma, which corroded formations. Setting up a large-scale defensive array here would require immense resources, so the Demon Miasma Sect had opted to station a Foundation Establishment cultivator instead.  

However, to prevent cave-ins, they had still set up a rudimentary "Sturdy Stone Formation."  

Now, it was this formation that kept the cavern intact.  

But Gu Yuan's attention was no longer on the formation or even the battle outside. His gaze burned with intensity as he stared deep into the cavern.  

There, a radiant silver light, tinged with threads of gold, pulsed brilliantly.  

**BOOM!**  

The stone liquid's effects faded, and Gu Yuan returned to normal. The glowing dots vanished, leaving only dust, chaos, and the panicked shouts of miners staring upward at the battle.  

They were all waiting to see the outcome.  

But Gu Yuan did not hesitate.  

He quickly hid Senior Brother Yang's body, set a trap near the pit containing the thirty Demon Star Stones, and then, clutching the Soul-Corroding Lime, hurried toward the cavern's depths.  

The deepest parts of the Demon Star Cavern were the source of the most concentrated demonic miasma. Without Golden Core cultivation, no one could escape from there.  

Moreover, the pervasive miasma disrupted cultivation, so the Demon Miasma Sect's overseers rarely lingered inside. Miners were generally free to move—so long as they met their quotas.  

Gu Yuan moved carefully, neither too fast nor too slow, slipping unnoticed toward the depths.  

The cavern was vast, and with miners divided into small groups—each wary of betrayal—no one paid him any mind.  

The ongoing battle above only helped mask his movements.  

But the deeper he went, the thicker the miasma became.  

His organs burned as if filled with molten lead. Agony wracked his body.  

The black miasma hung like a suffocating shroud, turning everything dark. No sane person would venture this deep.  

After just a few breaths in the miasma, Gu Yuan felt as though his body would dissolve into a bloody mist.  

Yet he gritted his teeth and endured.  

"This is the place!"  

Beyond the oppressive miasma, past swirling dust and smoke, a crack in the stone wall revealed a crevice just large enough for a person.  

Inside lay a skeleton, its bones jade-like, resting peacefully.  

In its right hand was a palm-sized token.  

The token was cyan, adorned with intricate vine-like patterns that shimmered faintly—though a layer of gray mist suppressed its glow.  

"This is it!"  

Gu Yuan's eyes lit up. This was the opportunity the stone liquid had revealed!  

He stepped forward, reaching for the token.  

**Cough!**  

But the miasma intensified. After just one step, his organs convulsed, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.  

His insides were beginning to liquefy.  

Yet retreating now would mean all his efforts were for nothing.  

Gritting his teeth, Gu Yuan forced his remaining spiritual energy to shield his organs—ignoring the excruciating pain from the Spirit-Severing Ring's backlash—and lunged forward.  

His fingers closed around the token.  

Then he scrambled back.  

**Cough! Cough!**  

Blood spilled from his lips as his body trembled.  

The miasma had seeped into his organs. Without treatment—or breaking the Spirit-Severing Ring—he would die.  

Yet his eyes blazed with vitality, shining brilliantly in the darkness.  

He had seized his chance.
