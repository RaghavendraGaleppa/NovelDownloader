# Chapter 179: Chang Jin

“Jing’er, please don’t leave again when you come home this time, okay?”

Before him, a familiar-looking middle-aged woman gripped Zhang Jing’s clothes tightly, her eyes filled with hope.

Before Zhang Jing could react, a man with a weathered face quietly emerged from the room. A faint, almost imperceptible anticipation flickered in his eyes. The next moment, the man’s expression darkened, and the anticipation in his eyes was concealed.

“Jing’er is destined to do great things! As his parents, we must never be a burden to him.” As he spoke, the man’s face suddenly flushed, and then a stream of crimson blood gushed from his mouth.

The middle-aged woman, who had been clutching Zhang Jing’s clothes moments before, instantly blanched. She rushed to the man’s side, her voice choked with sobs: “Jing’er, your father is dying. If you leave now, I’m afraid… I’m afraid you’ll never see him again.”

“It’s… it’s nothing.” The man gently shook his head at the woman, signaling her to stop. Then, he looked up at Zhang Jing, a forced smile appearing on his pale, bloodless face. He whispered, “Jing’er, your father is perfectly fine. It’s just… *cough cough*… *cough cough*… a minor cold. Go on, go busy yourself. Don’t worry about me.”

…

Zhang Jing stood still, quietly observing the scene before him.

The next moment, *Clap, clap!*

“Nice acting, but I also have a younger brother and sister. Why don’t I see them?” He clapped expressionlessly, reminding them.

No sooner had his voice fallen than, “Brother!” “Brother!” two crisp calls instantly rang out behind him.

Zhang Jing’s gaze froze. He had to admit, these demons were truly… quick to adapt!

That’s right. Zhang Jing was currently within the heart demon illusion woven by numerous demons in the space a thousand *zhang* beneath Human Prodigy Island. He knew it very well in his heart. He was merely curious to see how far these creatures could go, which was why he hadn't immediately exposed them.

Now it seemed, the heart demon illusion woven by these demons was quite realistic. Coupled with their exquisite acting skills and a good attitude of correcting their mistakes, it was no wonder the Red-Eyed Golden Peng had gotten lost in it.

*Whoosh*—

Zhang Jing’s gaze swept over the ‘parents’ before him. He sighed softly, a hint of complexity surfacing in his eyes. Not long after, the complexity transformed into determination. With a thought, in an instant, a pure, extreme crimson spiritual light abruptly flared. With just a gentle sweep, the illusion woven by the surrounding demons began to collapse little by little.

The ‘parents’ in front of him also revealed their true forms. They were two child-like figures, their faces emanating deep demonic light, upon which thousands of faces flickered, displaying various expressions of coldness or jealousy that immediately filled Zhang Jing’s vision.

“Cruel humans, we curse your immortal path to be blocked! We curse you to be assailed by heart demons when you break through!” The two demons looked at Zhang Jing, cursing in unison. Their voices were filled with boundless malice.

However, the next moment, the Scarlet God Spiritual Light swept over them again. The demons instantly turned into wisps of black smoke, thoroughly dissipating into ash.

“Heart demons? Will I fear heart demons?” A faint smile appeared at the corner of Zhang Jing’s eye.

…

His consciousness slowly withdrew from the shattered heart demon illusion. Only a mere instant had passed in the outside world. He glanced at the island quietly floating above. Zhang Jing’s speed suddenly accelerated!

…

On Human Prodigy Island, a man and a woman sat facing each other, separated by about a hundred *zhang*. The terrifying aura bursting from their bodies caused the air between them to subtly distort from the clash of their immense power.

Not far away, witnessing this terrifying scene, the Red-Eyed Golden Peng couldn’t help but shrink its head. It secretly glanced at the man clad in dark gold nine-dragon robes, its eyes filled with unconcealed shock.

Among the human race, there was a Foundation Establishment cultivator with such terrifying strength?! Although his aura was weaker than its master’s, they were clearly on the same level.

“As expected of the human race, capable of contending against the entire Myriad Spirits Alliance with the power of a single race! Even in the relatively weaker Foundation Establishment stage, a terrifying genius capable of rivaling a royal-level existence can emerge.” The Red-Eyed Golden Peng sighed inwardly. Then, a hint of schadenfreude flashed in its mind. “That idiotic sheep, whose head is only filled with thoughts of power, actually failed to probe the existence of this person from the Human Emperor Dao Court. Tsk tsk, he’s probably going to be scolded when he returns.”

Just then, a bright rainbow light suddenly burst into the Red-Eyed Golden Peng’s line of sight. It was startled for no reason.

…

Landing softly, a picturesque landscape of mountains and clear waters appeared before him.

“Is this Human Prodigy Island?” Zhang Jing curiously looked around.

The next moment, the two figures, a man and a woman, who were in a standoff, appeared in his vision. He paused his gaze for a moment on the woman whose face was obscured by mist, then directly focused on the man in the dark gold dragon robes opposite her. Zhang Jing wasn't surprised by the mysterious woman's presence here.

But this unfamiliar man—

“A human! And judging by his attire… the Human Emperor Dao Court?” Zhang Jing speculated with interest.

As he pondered, the two individuals opposite him turned their heads in unison. At the same time, two surging auras, like a breaching river, directly poured towards Zhang Jing. It was a test! And a warning! Transparent ripples instantly undulated within his line of sight.

“An intimidation tactic, huh? Interesting.” A smile of unclear meaning flashed in Zhang Jing’s eyes.

From the looks of it, these two were likely his true opponents in this competition for the top spot in the Foundation Establishment realm. Since that was the case, this show of force… perhaps he should deliver it himself!

The next moment, Yin-Yang, Five Elements, Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water… a total of thirty-six types of Dao intent erupted instantly, then began to entwine and merge, becoming perfectly harmonious and exuding an extremely dangerous and terrifying aura.

*Thump!*

Zhang Jing took a step forward. The immense, mountain-shattering aura emanating from him instantly condensed into a giant blade, pressing down simultaneously towards the two opponents.

*Boom—*

A thunderous roar suddenly echoed in his ears. The dragon-robed man’s expression abruptly changed.

…

Who knew how much time had passed. The three sat opposite each other.

“I am Ji Changyu of the Human Emperor Dao Court. It’s a pleasure to meet you, fellow Daoist.” The dragon-robed man looked at Zhang Jing with blazing eyes. He had never expected that within this Proud Cloud Secret Realm, besides himself and the woman from the Lunar Jade Rabbit Clan, there was another ninth-rank Foundation Establishment existence hidden! A surge of excitement rose in his heart. For Ji Changyu, while the rewards of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm were tempting, an opponent of equal caliber was what he desired most.

On the other side, “I am Chang Jin of the Lunar Jade Rabbit Clan. It’s a pleasure to meet you, fellow Daoist.” The woman, her face obscured in a hazy mist, spoke softly, her clear, melodious voice carrying a hint of terrifying majesty.

“I am Zhang Jing of the Grand Unity Immeasurable Dao Sect. It’s a pleasure to meet both of you, fellow Daoists.” Zhang Jing smiled slightly, his voice gentle.

Upon hearing this, Ji Changyu was slightly stunned. He seemed to have heard this name before. His imperial brother had reminded him to pay attention to this person, but he hadn’t taken it seriously at the time. Who would have thought…

Across from him, Chang Jin, upon hearing “Grand Unity Immeasurable Dao Sect,” also momentarily lost herself in thought. Not long after, a faint, knowing gaze slowly fell upon the Red-Eyed Golden Peng in the distance. Without a moment’s hesitation, the Red-Eyed Golden Peng stretched its neck, stuck its head directly into the ground, appearing utterly mortified.
