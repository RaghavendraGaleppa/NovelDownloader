# Chapter 104: Harvesting the Fruit and the Silver Book  

The enormous ice-blue fist loomed inches away, its terrifying wind pressure distorting Senior Brother Deng's face, making it nearly impossible for him to open his eyes. The chilling cold surged toward him, threatening to freeze everything within his body.  

The shadow of death clung to him like a specter.  

The enemy before him was more terrifying than any mutated demon beast from Thunderclap Mountain.  

"Stop!"  

"I surrender!"  

He couldn't help but shout in desperation, fearing that even a moment's delay would cost him his life.  

"Whoosh!"  

The instant his words left his lips, the massive fist vanished. Instead, a pale, slender hand gently grasped his robe and helped him to his feet.  

"My thanks for yielding, Senior Brother Deng!"  

A warm voice reached his ears. Senior Brother Deng, his face ashen, lifted his head and saw a handsome face smiling back at him.  

"Senior... Senior Brother Gu?!"  

His throat felt dry, as though he couldn't quite accept this outcome. But after a moment, he regained his composure and bowed deeply to Gu Yuan.  

"Senior Brother's skills are truly remarkable. I was no match for you—this defeat is mine to bear."  

As he spoke, his gaze flickered to Gu Yuan's plain, standard-issue Daoist robe, and he couldn't help but sigh. "I was blind to the world beyond my own well. The Azure Peak Dao Academy truly nurtures extraordinary talents—even among humble disciples like you, Senior Brother Gu. But with such abilities, why didn’t you assist Junior Sister Bian earlier...?"  

His brows furrowed slightly, still puzzled.  

"Adding flowers to brocade is never as memorable as delivering coal in snowy weather."  

"The joy of regaining what was lost makes a woman remember you all the better."  

Gu Yuan smiled faintly, even giving Senior Brother Deng a knowing wink.  

"So that’s how it is!"  

"With Senior Brother’s skills, once you reach Foundation Establishment, you’d be more than worthy of a noble maiden!"  

Senior Brother Deng let out a bitter laugh, finally understanding. So, it had all been part of Gu Yuan’s plan.  

He had truly suffered an undeserved misfortune.  

Still, after a moment’s hesitation, he spoke again. "Senior Brother, with your unparalleled talent and potential, you needn’t limit yourself to seeking a Dao companion within the Dao Academy."  

"At the foot of Blazing Thunder Peak, there’s a junior sister of mine who possesses the rare Yin Thunder Physique. She’s breathtakingly beautiful and would make an excellent match. If you were to marry her, my master would surely bestow generous gifts upon you. Perhaps you could visit Blazing Thunder Peak—I’d be happy to introduce you."  

As he spoke, he retrieved a crimson token and handed it to Gu Yuan.  

"This is the entry token for Blazing Thunder Peak. If you’re interested, you can come find me there..."  

The Blazing Thunder Peak faction shared similarities with the Bian family—both were benevolent and fond of forming good relationships. If they couldn’t overpower someone, their first instinct was to recruit them, placing multiple bets. Even in this situation, Senior Brother Deng couldn’t help but offer promises and benefits.  

But Gu Yuan cut him off directly. "Thank you for your kindness, Senior Brother Deng, but time is running short. It’s time to use the Azure Jade Token."  

"In that case, we’ll meet again in the future!"  

"With Senior Brother’s abilities, you could even contend for a True Disciple position!"  

Hearing this, Senior Brother Deng sighed deeply and said no more. He bowed to Gu Yuan, then took out his Azure Jade Token. In the next moment, his figure slowly vanished from the valley.  

……  

The vast Cloudmist Valley fell into silence, leaving only Gu Yuan behind.  

At this, a faint smile finally appeared in his eyes.  

He would never prioritize another’s interests above his own.  

Perhaps one day he might, but for now, Gu Yuan knew he was far from being a truly good person.  

The path of cultivation was fraught with hardships. For a humble disciple like him, climbing higher was even more difficult than scaling the heavens.  

Certain excesses of kindness and morality had to be cast aside.  

Thus, from the moment he entered Cloudmist Valley, he had bided his time, waiting for the perfect opportunity to ensure he was the only one left in the valley.  

Only then could he safely seize the hidden opportunity within.  

If that meant forcing Bian Chuyao out, so be it.  

Still, he wasn’t without principles. He would fulfill his promise to Bian Chuyao—just in his own way.  

Principles must never be eroded, but methods must remain flexible.  

Openness and righteousness were privileges reserved for the truly strong. The weak had no choice but to be pragmatic.  

"Here it is..."  

Gu Yuan sighed inwardly before swiftly moving to the crimson fire pool at the valley’s center.  

The pool was only a few zhang wide, its depths swirling with what seemed like molten lava. The scorching heat was terrifying.  

Yet, the higher the temperature, the more radiant the small golden tree grew. Beneath its branches, a golden fruit shimmered with a fiery glow, as though liquid flames danced within it.  

This was Bian Chuyao’s objective—the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit.  

The fruit couldn’t be plucked by hand. Only a Crimson Fire Jade could sever its branch.  

Gu Yuan retrieved a red jade ruler from his storage pouch, channeled fire energy into it, and carefully tapped the fruit loose. He placed it in a jade box and stored it away.  

Then, he activated his Heavenly Insight Eyes to their fullest, scanning the fire pool.  

The Stone Liquid had indicated that the opportunity lay beneath the pool.  

This was precisely why Gu Yuan had needed Bian Chuyao to leave. With her present, his actions would have been far too restricted.  

"Gurgle..."  

But even with his enhanced vision, Gu Yuan saw nothing unusual—only the occasional surge of crimson magma, releasing billowing heat.  

"It seems... I’ll have to take the risk."  

An opportunity marked by silver and gold could alter one’s fate. It was worth the gamble.  

"Thud!"  

Without further hesitation, Gu Yuan unleashed his magic power, activating the Minor Giant Seal, the Azure Lotus Seal, and the Black Tortoise Seal. Then, he leaped straight into the fire pool.  

"Sizzle—!"  

The boiling magma, born from the spiritual veins, was unbearably hot. Even with all his defenses, Gu Yuan was only at the Qi Refining stage. Against the might of nature, he was still at a disadvantage.  

Within moments, the glow of his protective seals dimmed, and his magic power drained rapidly.  

His expression grew solemn. Fortunately, the Stone Liquid’s guidance was precise. Though he couldn’t see clearly, he could still sense the opportunity’s location. He followed the pull, diving deeper.  

However, the fire pool was far deeper than it appeared. By the time Gu Yuan’s magic power was nearly half-depleted, there was still nothing but rolling flames ahead.  

His heart sank.  

If he didn’t find the opportunity soon, he’d have to retreat—or risk being burned alive once his magic ran out.  

But just then, a faint shadow appeared in the distance.  

Gu Yuan’s eyes lit up. He surged forward and soon saw a figure seated cross-legged at the bottom of the pool.  

It was a middle-aged cultivator clad in an embroidered black robe, his features stern and dignified.  

He sat unmoving in the flames, his body completely unharmed—not even a single hair was singed. His eyes were closed, as though he were merely asleep, yet his chest showed no sign of breathing.  

Resting on his lap was a silver book, seemingly crafted from some exotic beast hide. It was dull, all traces of its aura concealed.  

The opportunity!  

With his magic power dwindling, Gu Yuan wasted no time. He snatched the book and immediately ascended, not even bothering to search the robed figure for other treasures.
