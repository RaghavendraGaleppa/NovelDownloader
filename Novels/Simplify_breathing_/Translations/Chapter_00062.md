**Chapter 62: Exorbitant Profits**

In the end, Chen Fei and his companion decided to follow the Immortal Cloud Merchant Guild. Not for any other reason, but purely for safety. The strange encounter on the way to Xingfen City had left too deep an impression on Chen Fei, and he didn't want to experience something like that again. A single red candle cost a thousand taels; if they followed another small merchant group and accidentally had to use one, wouldn't that be an even greater loss? The Immortal Cloud Merchant Guild clearly knew its own worth, which was why it dared to demand such a price.

When Chen Fei and his companion arrived at the Immortal Cloud Merchant Guild's outpost, they found it already bustling with people. Of course, most were there to trade with the guild, with only a small portion intending to follow the caravan. But even this small portion numbered nearly a hundred people.

"They've already earned a hundred thousand taels just like this," Chen Fei said with a touch of envy. Although Chen Fei could now refine the Everfloat Pill, and his income seemed decent, accumulating this much money would take at least several months, and he couldn't afford to be lazy. Moreover, such high earnings would likely attract trouble. But not earning money when one could, and just holding back, that was also unbearable.

"The Immortal Cloud Merchant Guild won't depart until three days from now. So, it's not just a hundred thousand taels." Chi Defeng sighed with a hint of melancholy. He also liked money and had saved quite a bit, but compared to the Immortal Cloud Merchant Guild, he didn't even have the right to compare.

Chi Defeng smiled and shook his head. "They probably saw our sign." The Immortal Cloud Merchant Guild recognized passes, not people. Stealing one of these passes was equivalent to a thousand taels. Even if one didn't use it themselves, reselling it could net several hundred taels – a truly lucrative business.

"It seems there will be a lot of theft in Xingfen City in the coming days then," Chen Fei couldn't help but shake his head. Some martial artists would likely rely on their strength to outright steal, or even snatch, the passes.

Chen Fei and his companion circled the streets twice, purchasing many items. The journey to Immortal Cloud City would take more than ten days. The Immortal Cloud Merchant Guild only agreed to let them follow; it didn't say anything about providing food and water, which they had to prepare themselves. After several turns through various alleys, shaking off their tail, Chen Fei and his companion returned to their courtyard.

At the Immortal Guest Restaurant.

"To be able to invite Supervisor Dong here today, Xu is truly fortunate," Xu Wangliang said, looking at Dong Yi, and took a sip from his own cup as a gesture of politeness.

"The caravan still has matters to attend to later. If you have something to say, please be direct."

If it had been another small merchant group, such trouble wouldn't have been necessary; Xu Wangliang's own strength would have been enough to pressure them into agreement. But with the Immortal Cloud Merchant Guild, Xu Wangliang lacked the power and the audacity to force them, so he naturally had to pull strings.

"Those people departing in three days have all paid their fees. What you're proposing puts me in a difficult position," Dong Yi said, his brow slightly furrowed. A thousand taels per person was already a high enough price. But because safety was largely guaranteed, the Immortal Cloud Merchant Guild collected it with a clear conscience. Now, with the money already collected, to "resell" the people again three days later would be simply too unsightly. Although Dong Yi was a supervisor, such an action would damage the guild's reputation, making it difficult for him to agree.

"I hope Supervisor Dong can understand," Xu Wangliang said, pulling another stack of silver notes from his sleeve and placing them on the table.

Dong Yi's eyes flickered. This stack was another ten thousand taels, which, added to the previous amount, totaled twenty thousand taels. It would take Dong Yi a considerable amount of time to earn this sum on his own. Now, all it took was a nod, and this money would be his.
