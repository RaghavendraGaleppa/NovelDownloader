Chapter 86: Li Mo: "Am I that impressive?"

The day's combat training session had come to an end, but according to Master, it would continue the next day.

"Another day of fighting?" Li Mo walked into the kitchen with a lifeless gaze. "This life is unbearable."

"Using the power of the World Seed takes a toll on me..." As he lit the stove to cook, Li Mo discovered a change within his body. His internal energy had become stronger than before the fight. He was perplexed, having only taken a beating.

"You're experiencing the benefits now," a languid voice said. Shang Wu leaned against the doorframe, her hands clasped behind her back. "Hmph, most people can't even get a chance to be hit by me."

Li Mo pondered, thinking about the Domain. It seemed that Master hadn't unleashed it without reason. The Domain had helped him further refine the essence lingering in his body due to long-term consumption of Earth Pulse Spirit Milk. Moreover, his physical body felt more relaxed, and the sharp, murderous energy within him had been smoothed out.

"Thanks, Master," Li Mo said sincerely. "I'll treat you to a great wine tonight, a really good one."

"You're showing some gratitude, at least," Shang Wu said with a light snort. She then realized her hands were still clasped behind her back and relaxed, revealing that she had been holding a rolling pin. "Huh? Where's my rolling pin? That's strange..."

After some commotion, dinner was finally served at Qiushui Pavilion. Li Mo kept his promise and brought out a rare wine, "Xianren Zui," which was one of the top rewards given by the System.

"You actually have this kind of good stuff!" Shang Wu exclaimed, hugging the wine jar and taking a deep sniff. Her face turned flushed, and she smiled blissfully. "Tonight, I'll teach you my second skill: being able to drink a thousand cups without getting drunk!"

Li Mo felt that he might not need to learn that skill. As he turned around, he heard footsteps behind him. "You're finally down. Are you okay?" he asked.

"I'm fine," Ying Bing replied, shaking her head. Her eyes showed complex emotions, and her small face was pale, her voice a bit hoarse.

Li Mo poured her a cup of tea, looking concerned. Something was off about Ying Bing, and he couldn't just ignore it since she was his top investment.

"I'm fine," she repeated.

Just then, Li Mo remembered he had a trump card. "Tianming Shenyan, activate!" The System's analysis appeared before him.

【Name: Ying Bing】
【Age: 16】
【Root Bone: Taiyin Moon Phoenix Body】
【Cultivation: Internal Energy Coagulation Realm】
【Tianming: Red (Born with Imperial Bone, Xuanbing as fate, Qiushui as divine, having the appearance of a Phoenix Heaven)】
【Evaluation: Destiny is filled with tribulations, yet always manages to turn danger into good fortune. Currently, feathers are not yet full, but when the wind and clouds change, she will soar to the nine heavens and ten lands, a Phoenix ruling over the six directions and eight wildernesses.】
【Recent Experience: Foresaw an existence that she couldn't surpass, unable to accept her own defeat, having a mental setback, doubting her persistence in the martial path. The Taiyin force is out of control, deeply rooted in her body, putting her in a weak state.】

Li Mo's eyes widened in surprise. "Who is that powerful being that made Bing Bing feel defeated?"

Ying Bing's weak voice came again, "You... are much stronger than yesterday."

"Me?" Li Mo pointed to himself, taken aback. "Besides possessing a divine weapon, your internal energy is also unusual."

Shang Wu, who had been quiet, suddenly spoke up, "My good disciple, you're actually quite strong. If I were to suppress my cultivation to your level and fight you, it would be a close match, maybe 55-45. In a life-or-death battle, you'd have a 73 advantage."

Li Mo was stunned by the recognition from the top fighter of Qingyuan Sect.

As the night went on, Shang Wu became drunk quickly, her face flushed, and she started to ramble about her past experiences. Li Mo listened intently, and when she mentioned storytellers, his eyes lit up.

"Have you heard of storytelling?" Shang Wu asked, leaning on one hand.

Li Mo smiled mysteriously, "Not only have I heard it, but I also know many stories that you haven't heard."

Shang Wu didn't believe him, but Li Mo continued, "If you don't believe me, listen to this story."

With a tap on the table, Li Mo began in a storytelling tone, "Two beautiful ladies, I'm parched and can't continue without a drink. Can you reward me with a cup of wine?"

Shang Wu and Ying Bing were amused by his performance. Shang Wu poured him a cup of "Xianren Zui."

Li Mo took a sip, feeling invigorated. He began to tell a story, "The story I'm about to tell is called 'The Return of the Female Emperor'."

Ying Bing's eyes widened slightly, while Shang Wu showed interest.

Li Mo's clear voice echoed through the room as he started to tell the tale, accompanied by a little poem: "In the desolate valley, the cold wind blows, the cicada's cry is sparse... the female returns!"
