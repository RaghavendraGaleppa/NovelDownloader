# Chapter 37: Body Refinement Technique, Spirit Refinement Art

Seeing the two leave, Yang Ji's expression subtly changed. Knowing his residence had been exposed, he informed Jin Suanpan and then departed from this island pillar. After flying for dozens of li, he found a new island pillar, carved out a stone house, and moved in.

It was already deep into the night, but Yang Ji remained awake, his spirit becoming even more invigorated. Inside the stone house, he was currently using his Earth Spirit Fire to burn a piece of rotten hardwood. The debris on the surface of the hardwood continuously turned into ashes and dissipated in the spirit fire. As time passed, the rotten wooden surface was finally completely burned away, revealing a jade slip within. With a trace of excitement, Yang Ji immediately extended his divine sense into it to uncover the mysteries of the great divine ability, "Humanoid Weapon."

The entire jade slip's interior was like a spiritual realm, incredibly dreamlike, filled with golden tadpole-like runes. Each rune emanated a special Dao韵, possessing no fixed form and existing in a state of disorder. After observing for a moment, Yang Ji understood why great divine abilities were always carried in special ways and could not be written down in words. This was because great divine abilities involved the Dao, ever-changing and profound. They could only be comprehended through intuition, not taught or explained verbally; all fortune depended on the individual. He understood that these golden tadpole-like runes, radiating Dao韵, must contain the profound mysteries of "Humanoid Weapon." At first glance, he found it incredibly profound, like a celestial scripture. No wonder people said great divine abilities were difficult to comprehend; it was truly justified.

After a brief wandering of thoughts, Yang Ji quickly refocused. His divine sense touched the golden tadpole-like runes, and he began to comprehend their mysteries. Three full hours passed, with the golden tadpole-like runes continuously twisting in disorder, undergoing countless changes. For a time, he was utterly bewildered, comprehending nothing, and feeling no artistic conception or mystery. But he did not feel discouraged, nor anxious. Guided by his 'golden finger', he continuously tried and erred. Just like that, his comprehension lasted for three days.

After three days of continuous comprehension, he finally touched upon some profound mysteries and realized that this was a great divine ability for body refinement. He noticed that those golden tadpole-like runes became more active under his divine sense, like tiny figures slowly moving and shifting. This filled Yang Ji with joy; he finally had a breakthrough. As his comprehension deepened, an inexplicable, magnificent Dao sound resonated in his heart. All the golden tadpole-like runes also arranged themselves orderly within his perception, forming a short scripture that flowed through his mind like a gentle stream. At this moment, Yang Ji wanted to seize this opportunity and write down the scripture in order.

He immediately activated his cultivation technique, condensing water vapor from the air, and with fluid strokes, he wrote down the scripture on a stone slab in one go. But before he could rejoice, he saw lines of text rapidly fading. Under the influence of a mysterious power, the residual water stains instantly boiled, quickly turning into steam and vanishing. A faint golden light flashed on the ground, accompanied by two hissing sounds. Amidst the rising green smoke, even the traces of the characters he had forcefully etched with his finger were erased.

[Dao scriptures are not permitted to manifest; Dao power destroys them.]

"This..." Yang Ji was astonished. "The Great Dao doesn't allow manifestation? The Dao power contained in my strokes actually communicated with the mighty forces between heaven and earth, destroying everything." He muttered, "I only wanted to write down the scripture, and this isn't allowed? This Great Dao is so hard to attain; even its scriptures aren't allowed to be made public. No wonder they say it's difficult to attain the Dao, truly difficult. How can someone with poor innate talent attain the Dao? The Great Dao is ethereal. Dao cultivation techniques and great divine abilities are bridges to the 'Dao,' yet often, even with Dao methods in hand, people cannot step onto the Dao bridge and attain immortality."

At this moment, Yang Ji had many insights. Today, by involving the Great Dao through a great divine ability, he realized that the deeper one cultivated, the more difficult it became. Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Soul Transformation, Void Refinement, Body Integration, Mahayana, Tribulation Immortal. It seemed there were only nine major realms, but very, very few could reach Void Refinement to comprehend the Dao and pass tribulations to become immortals. There were simply too many difficulties and obstacles. Looking across the vast Thousand Islands Sea, Soul Transformation was already the strongest; Void Refinement and peering into the Dao were completely unattainable. This was because the Void Refinement realm could not be reached through mere arduous cultivation; it required a preliminary comprehension of the profound mysteries of the Great Dao. As for the Dao contained within "Humanoid Weapon," it was merely superficial, not even one ten-thousandth, one hundred-thousandth, or even one millionth of the Great Dao.

At this moment, Yang Ji felt a sense of awe towards cultivation, and at the same time, an unyielding drive arose within him. He no longer forced himself to write but instead delved deeper into comprehension. Another three days passed like this.

On the sixth day since he began comprehending, Yang Ji's mind suddenly became clear. The golden tadpole-like runes within the jade slip seemed to come alive, transforming into golden light and rushing into his sea of consciousness, imprinting themselves deep within his soul. Then, with a thought, those golden tadpole-like runes instantly surged towards his limbs, torso, and also his internal organs, flesh, and bones. From head to toe, inside and out, including his soul, every inch was covered with golden tadpole-like runes. The runes emitted a faint golden glow, connecting with an inexplicable Dao power, as if invisible lightning strikes were coursing through him.

Under the tempering of the Dao power, his entire body crackled, like thunder striking. His blood surged and churned, boiling ceaselessly, and his skin and flesh trembled continuously, like shaking chaff. It was precisely like artifact refining: using Dao power as a hammer and his body as material to forge the strongest weapon. At this moment, Yang Ji knew that after six days of comprehension, he had finally gained entry into this great divine ability for body refinement. Using Dao power as a hammer to temper the physical body—this cultivation method for body refinement was truly rare and quite ferocious. Under the bombardment of Dao power, Yang Ji winced slightly, feeling as if his body was being struck by lightning, trembling violently all over. However, he could feel that as the Dao power struck, his physical body was growing stronger.

Day after day passed. Another night of cultivation, and time swiftly passed. Until the sun rose in the east, painting the sky crimson. Only then did Yang Ji exhale and withdraw his cultivation, hiding all the golden runes. After more than twenty days of sleepless nights, he surprisingly felt no fatigue whatsoever. Instead, he was radiant and exceptionally spirited. Upon using his divine sense to inspect his interior, he found that the surface of his blood had a faint luster, and his bones emitted a subtle, glistening white light. Clenching his fist, a surge of power coursed through his entire body, and his joints cracked audibly. Punching out, like a shooting star chasing the moon, with a "bang," he actually created a terrifying sonic boom. A normal punch, without activating any spell, was unexpectedly powerful and heavy, with his strength increasing significantly.

"This Humanoid Weapon truly lives up to its name as a great divine ability; it's far too extraordinary. My strength has increased this much after only twenty-odd days of tempering." Yang Ji now carefully sensed his physique, clearly noticing that his muscles, bones, and skin had become much denser. Most importantly... his soul strength had actually increased, and his divine sense had grown considerably. This discovery utterly shocked Yang Ji: "These golden tadpole-like runes cover my entire body, not only refining my physical body but also tempering my soul. Is this not just a body refinement technique, but also a precious and rare spirit refinement technique?"

Spirit refinement techniques were extremely valuable, their importance no less than that of top-tier cultivation techniques. Nascent Soul True Monarchs wishing to achieve a Pure Yang Primordial Spirit had to overcome three tribulations, which were soul tribulations. While there were many forces in the entire Thousand Islands Sea, only the three great sects and a few major families had Nascent Soul True Monarchs presiding. The reason Nascent Soul True Monarchs were difficult to achieve was that those with insufficient soul strength could not pass the soul tribulation. The reason the three great sects had quite a few Nascent Soul True Monarchs was that each of them possessed a top-tier spirit refinement technique, close to a great divine ability. These spirit refinement techniques were the core of the core, inaccessible to ordinary people.

Throughout the entire Thousand Islands Sea, spirit refinement techniques were extremely rare. Most forces did not possess them, and those that did only had inferior spirit refinement methods, yet they regarded them as treasures. This demonstrated the preciousness and importance of spirit refinement techniques. Yang Ji was now utterly ecstatic. The one in his hands was a great divine ability spirit refinement art, even better than the top-tier spirit refinement techniques of the three great sects. What disappointed him was that there was only one volume, which couldn't help him achieve a Pure Yang Primordial Spirit. Yang Ji shook his head, full of regret. However, knowing the power of this Humanoid Weapon, his heart yearned immensely for the second volume. If he was fortunate enough to cultivate it completely, he would definitely become the number one cultivator in the Thousand Islands Sea.
