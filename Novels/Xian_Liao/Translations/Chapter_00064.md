# Chapter 64: Spiritual Mechanism

"Kui Niu, twenty zhang in length, resembles an ox in form, with a voice like thunder, its entire body deep blue. Its skin is harder than steel and capable of emitting electrical light."

Zhou Qing used the mythical Kui Niu to describe the electrical device he intended to create.

In truth, there were other creatures capable of generating electricity, such as electric eels and electric rays. However, electric eels in Zhou Qing's previous life were native to the Americas, with no records of them in ancient China. This world's background was similar to ancient China, and similarly, there were no records of electric eels.

As for electric rays, they were deep-sea creatures. Whether in ancient times or the present world, exploring the ocean depths to capture them was clearly impossible.

Diving to the seabed relying solely on physical strength was highly unlikely, even for those at the Xiantian level.

In his previous life, many expert divers using modern technology had perished attempting deep dives.

A month later.

Zhang Jingxiu and Fusong saw the so-called "lightning artifact" Zhou Qing had mentioned.

Constructed from a waterwheel, iron sheets, lacquered copper wires, and magnets, the materials were not uncommon. Could such a thing truly produce lightning?

Fusong couldn't help but doubt.

Zhang Jingxiu, however, was more open-minded. "Ancient master craftsmen created mechanical birds that could fly for three days before landing. Such legendary mechanisms are no different from the magical artifacts spoken of in our Taoist traditions. Mechanisms and artifacts must share common principles. Now, Scholar Zhou has used mechanical principles to create a lightning artifact, truly following in the footsteps of the ancients. Allow me to test it first."

Zhou Qing himself wasn't entirely confident in this creation. Although in his previous life there were instances of using electrical stimulation to train the body, the Xiantian level in this world far exceeded the physical limits of humans in his past life.

Whether this "artifact" he'd crafted with his knowledge and wisdom could produce effects comparable to heavenly lightning was uncertain.

But cultivation was also called "seeking truth." How could one know without trying?

Just as Zhang Jingxiu had to see Fushan before believing in the existence of the Xiantian realm—this was empirical evidence.

Knowledge from books is shallow; true understanding comes from practice.

Like in the novels, where the seventh layer of the Qiankun Great Shift contained nineteen errors—because its creator had never cultivated the internal strength required for that layer.

Without attempting it, one wouldn't know what was true or false about the seventh layer.

Even with Fushan as a living example, the Xiantian realm remained an unknown frontier for Zhou Qing and his companions.

Which knowledge from his past life could be applied to cultivation in this world, and which couldn't, required experimentation to determine.

As for whether this artifact could change the world as electricity had in his previous life—that was wishful thinking. The application of electricity wasn't about electricity itself, but about a civilization's advancement enabling the creation of devices that could harness it.

Zhou Qing's individual knowledge and wisdom were but a drop in the ocean compared to such advancement.

If he diverted his focus to this, his cultivation would suffer—it would be putting the cart before the horse.

What he sought was longevity!

Only through longevity could all desires be fulfilled. The pursuit of longevity was an expression of great desire. When emperors sought immortality, they were essentially trying to preserve their supreme power.

The cruelty of death lay in its power to strip away everything.

Whether emperor or commoner, death would strip away all they possessed, leaving nothing but smoke.

...

Zhang Jingxiu connected silver wires to the lightning artifact, which resembled an unknown monster. Powered by the waterwheel, it generated electricity.

Zhou Qing had named it "Kui."

After a while, Zhang Jingxiu stood up.

"How was it?"

"It does stimulate the spirit, muscles, bones, and even affects the internal organs."

"So it works?" Fusong asked eagerly.

"That remains to be seen over time."

In the following days, Zhang Jingxiu used "Kui" to train his body. At first, he seemed pleased, but his expression grew increasingly grave.

Another month passed.

Zhou Qing, Fusong, and Zhang Jingxiu gathered again.

Zhang Jingxiu said, "Scholar Zhou, it seems this device still cannot compare to true heavenly lightning. The power of the heavens is not easily stolen by mortal hands."

Zhou Qing thought, "Could the current be too weak? Or is something else missing?"

He asked, "Please elaborate."

Zhang Jingxiu replied, "This device does generate electricity and has some effect on cultivation, but it cannot possibly help one break through to the Xiantian realm. It lacks spiritual mechanism."

Zhou Qing had often encountered the term "spiritual mechanism" in his cultivation, but its descriptions were vague.

Now that Zhang Jingxiu mentioned it, it clearly wasn't so simple.

"How do you know it lacks spiritual mechanism? Where does spiritual mechanism come from?"

Zhang Jingxiu explained, "Spiritual mechanism is an intangible, mystical substance. I once doubted its existence, but using 'Kui' has convinced me. Heavenly lightning is the convergence of yin and yang energies, capable of generating spiritual mechanism. Certain rare herbs or formidable beasts that absorb the essence of mountains, rivers, sun, and moon may also possess it.

"If Scholar Zhou successfully cultivates the Five Organs Thunder Resonance, harmonizing bones and tendons, cleansing marrow, and exchanging energies with heaven and earth, he should naturally draw upon the spiritual mechanism of the world and advance to the Xiantian realm.

"Those of us lacking such conditions must resort to dangerous methods like attracting heavenly lightning to momentarily elevate ourselves and absorb its spiritual mechanism. The immense power of heavenly lightning produces significant spiritual mechanism in an instant—but surviving the process is the true challenge."

...

Observing his Health Monitor, Zhou Qing saw his lifespan remained at 120 years, unchanged.

His Gang Jin (hard energy) had improved to "proficient," nearing mastery.

It seemed fusing Tiger's Malevolence to produce Gang Sha (hard-soft energy) would take time.

However, Gang Sha was clearly more suited for martial contests or exorcising spirits.

Against the red python, arrows, narcotics, and heavy weapons were still necessary.

His rapid-arrow technique was now rated as "mastered" by the Health Monitor—a natural progression.

Currently, he learned martial techniques exceptionally quickly. Though still far from the legendary Zhang Wuji, who mastered the Nine Yang Manual and could instantly grasp any martial art.

"Xiantian!" Zhou Qing's desire for the Xiantian realm grew stronger—it was the true beginning of the path to immortality. He would never be satisfied with merely being a skilled martial artist.

During this time, Zhou Qing also compiled his Treatise on Plagues and presented it to Governor Song He of Tiannan.

...

Before winter, hunters discovered traces of the red python.

Professional matters required professionals.

Skilled hunters possessed an innate sharpness Zhou Qing couldn't simply acquire through study.

With these leads, Zhou Qing and Zhang Jingxiu made final preparations.

When the first snow fell, they set out.

Their target:

The python!

In winter, the red python fed voraciously, its movements slowed by the cold—the perfect opportunity for Zhou Qing's group to hunt it.

Before then, Zhou Qing aimed to master the Deer Play True Words.

Mastery of the Deer Play would produce Deer's Thunder Resonance, strengthening his liver. A robust liver would revitalize his entire body's qi and blood, providing greater vitality.

His strength would advance further, and even severe injuries could be withstood, allowing for counterattacks.

Additionally, Zhou Qing prepared potent narcotics, having observed the python's strong resistance to poison. Slowing its movements was the goal.

Last time, poison had served a similar purpose.

This time, narcotics would be used directly.

Zhou Qing also acquired a five-stone bow from Miss Lin, crafted from the finest materials for power and durability.

At his current level, he could draw and rapidly fire the bow.

Against the python, arrows would weaken it first, creating opportunities for close-quarters combat.

Zhou Qing would handle ranged attacks, leaving melee to Zhang Jingxiu and his senior brother.

Still, he had Miss Lin commission a Green Dragon Halberd.

The halberd, similar to a spear, demanded exceptional skill.

It featured a spearhead with a crescent blade attached—capable of both thrusting and slashing.

Zhou Qing chose the single-bladed Green Dragon Halberd over the double-bladed Fangtian Halberd (associated with the legendary Lü Bu).

Mastering such a weapon quickly was difficult, but it was a backup—his focus remained on archery.

He practiced against a thick target beside the great mulberry tree, not the tree itself.

The python's size minimized aiming requirements; speed was key.

Drawing the five-stone bow repeatedly demanded immense stamina.

Fortunately, Zhou Qing's tiger-like strength made it manageable.

His daily routine: warm up with Five Viscera Exercises, practice rapid archery, then use the mulberry tree's yin energy to balance his yang qi. When the mad Taoist chanted scriptures, Zhou Qing listened to the thunderous resonance.

The Deer Play True Words progressed steadily.

In spare moments, he read to nurture his spirit and practiced the halberd.

Halberd, spear, and sword techniques shared similarities. His mastery of Bird Play made weapons like these easier to handle.

In fact, the Bird Play allowed him to grasp the basics of all eighteen weapons quickly.

Bear Play greatly aided his grappling techniques.

Deer Play enhanced footwork and agility.

Tiger Play strengthened fists.

As for Monkey Play, it was crucial for his Five Viscera Thunder Resonance, teaching him internal qi circulation and unifying his qi and blood.

But true qi could only be cultivated at the Xiantian level.

...

In the courtyard, beside the great mulberry tree.

Zhou Qing's body emitted deer-like thunderous resonance, cleansing his liver. Though autumn, his body brimmed with vitality.

Without the mulberry tree, mastering Deer's Thunder Resonance would have taken three to five years without elixirs.

The mad Taoist's scripture chanting occurred only every five days, varying in duration.

The tree's yin energy balanced his yang qi, accelerating his progress—mastery took just over half a year.

Thus, the tree's aid was equivalent to half a seven-leaf ginseng.

Their relationship was symbiotic.

Without Zhou Qing's elixirs and offerings—the fox spirit, Squire Zhang's ghost, and the monk's corpse—the tree wouldn't have thrived.

The tree lived off him.

His request for cultivation assistance was modest.

Nourished by Zhou Qing's yang qi, the tree remained evergreen, its bark hardening like iron.

Yet its branches stayed supple—unsuitable for arrows.

Perhaps one day they'd make spirit-piercing shafts.

The tree clearly had potent effects against spirits.

Deer's Thunder Resonance sharpened Zhou Qing's vision like an eagle's, with further improvements likely.

Would his eyes one day develop other mystical abilities?

They already showed signs of becoming "thousand-mile eyes."

He sensed his path to Xiantian differed from Zhang Jingxiu's—closer to the legendary Jingyang Zhenren's.

Upon reaching Xiantian, his lifespan should extend to 200 years.
