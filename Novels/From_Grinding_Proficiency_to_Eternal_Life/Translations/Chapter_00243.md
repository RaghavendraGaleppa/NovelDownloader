# Chapter 243: Mastered in a Single Night

The so-called prerequisite martial arts. Xu Yunfan was well aware that the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art operated along the three jiao meridians—the upper, middle, and lower jiao corresponding to the heart and lungs, the spleen and stomach, and the kidney meridians, respectively.

It was a refined martial art that allowed one to temper the internal organs in advance. As long as one cultivated internal force within themselves, they could use the unique circulation method of the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art to penetrate the three jiao meridians and temper the organs prematurely.

If this method's intricacies were revealed in the martial world, it would undoubtedly stir up a storm of blood and violence.

The Six Great Clades truly possessed many treasures...

Xu Yunfan's mind raced with various thoughts, but he quickly reined them in and focused on cultivating the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art.

Twilight was like blood, and the setting sun was about to sink below the horizon.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on a green stone within the secret realm. The muscle groups along his spine writhed, bursting forth with wisps of internal force that flowed through his flesh and blood.

As the blood energy throughout his body grew increasingly active with the circulation of his blood, he closed his eyes and concentrated. Using the Red Python Mountain-Suppressing Force as his foundation, he transformed his blood energy into fine threads that seeped into the three jiao meridians. The upper jiao was like a sword sheath suspended between his heart and lungs, the middle jiao like a sword furnace churning within his spleen and stomach, and the lower jiao like a quenching pool sinking deep into his kidney meridian.

The concept of the meridian system belongs to the category of blood vessels. The Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art naturally utilizes the five elements and five organs to forge a unique sword qi belonging solely to oneself.

He formed a sword seal with his hands, and the veins on his temples throbbed continuously as his internal force delved deeper.

`[You are cultivating the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art. Due to your abundant blood energy and internal force penetrating your blood, you quickly located the positions of the three jiao meridians. You have gained a preliminary understanding of the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art.]`

`[You continuously differentiate wisps of internal force, entering the fine meridians to condense the first strand of sword qi for the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art.]`

Although the internal force had entered the blood, penetrating the fine meridians within the organs would have been impossible with the crude methods of the Red Python Mountain-Suppressing Force alone, without the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art.

He did not know how much time had passed when a clear hum suddenly erupted from the upper jiao meridian. A strand of sword qi, carrying an extreme sharpness, slowly coalesced and flowed within the meridian. As it swam, it continuously pierced the meridian full of holes.

In the middle jiao, a scarlet internal force like molten iron surged, repeatedly forging the meridians through which the blood energy flowed. Finally, it shattered the condensed internal force, scattering it into the meridians as fine as hair.

In the lower jiao, as the kidney meridian flowed, black ripples appeared. Every tremor of blood energy caused his body to shudder slightly.

Pain. It was incredibly painful.

Xu Yunfan reacted instantly. The pain wracking his body made his muscles and sinews convulse, but he still firmly stabilized his form, slowly transforming the Red Python internal force into threads and continuously seeping them into the meridians.

This Pei Yan seemed to have set a trap for him!

To cultivate the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art, one probably needed the special secret medicine from the Sword Pavilion to strengthen the meridians in advance, preventing them from becoming as full of holes as they were now.

Suddenly, his throat trembled, and a trickle of blood seeped from the corner of his mouth. The sword furnace condensed in the middle jiao lost control and churned, its scorching internal force almost burning through his spleen.

In the critical moment, his dragon scale armor leaves hummed and trembled, forcibly suppressing the rampaging blood energy.

Xu Yunfan slapped the mechanism box always hung on his chest. After the box revealed a small hole, the head of the Ginseng Spirit shot out. Just as it was about to frantically absorb spiritual energy, it found the place to be a barren wasteland. While it was still dazed, Xu Yunfan took two large gulps of its ginseng qi and quickly pushed it back in.

A massive, scorching-hot current like molten lava rapidly circulated through his flesh and blood. Carried by the Red Python Mountain-Suppressing Force, it transformed into eight spirals that rushed into the meridians, beginning to rapidly repair the ravaged meridians and forcefully贯通 the three meridians into a Sword Dao cycle.

As the morning dawn pierced the mist of the secret realm, Xu Yunfan's eyes snapped open. He pointed his index and middle fingers like a sword toward a green stone three zhang away.

A strand of sword qi, mixed with the Red Python's vicious energy, shot through the air, actually leaving a spiral sword mark half an inch deep in the green stone. The edges were even covered in fine, scale-like patterns—the trace of the Red Python Mountain-Suppressing Force, which had been integrated into the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art but not yet fully refined.

`[Your Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art has been mastered.]`

Xu Yunfan slowly rose to his feet. Simultaneously, waves of warm currents rose within his body, transforming into threads as fine as hair that钻入 his meridians, continuously repairing the meridians that had been pierced into a miserable state.

Feeling his internal organs and meridians begin to recover and strengthen, Xu Yunfan finally let out a long breath, carefully sensing the memories flowing through his mind.

According to the orthodox inheritance of the Sword Pavilion, cultivators of the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art needed the Sword Pavilion's unique secret medicine, the Three Cycles Brightness Pill, along with the Jade Marrow Vein-Washing Powder. They had to wash and train their meridians in a medicinal bath in a cold pool at the hour of Chen (7-9 a.m.).

The upper jiao, heart and lungs, needed to borrow the atomized medicinal qi to soak the Tanzhong point, using gentle medicinal power to cleanse the sword sheath's embryonic form. The middle jiao, spleen and stomach, used the dissolved red jade marrow liquid to irrigate, making the meridians like a sword furnace melting iron, gradually adapting to the scorching internal force. The lower jiao, kidney meridian, required the "Mountain-Shattering Shock Force" technique to penetrate the secret medicine deep into the Qihai point, making the quenching-pool-like meridians ten times more resilient.

Only when one could initially bear the pain of internal force transforming into threads without the meridians shattering was one qualified to cultivate.

This process often took three years. Only when the three jiao meridians could bear the pain of internal force transforming into threads without shattering, and the cultivator could抽取 the qi from the Dantian into three thousand fine threads, piercing the three jiao like silver needles piercing acupoints, did they truly touch the threshold of this supreme art.

Among ten people, only two or three could endure the agony of meridian scorching. Successful candidates often had blood seeping from their fingertips and cold sweat on their foreheads. Only then could they be said to have truly grasped this supreme art.

"Interesting..."

Looking at the Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art skill that had appeared in the Arts column of his attribute panel, Xu Yunfan's expression carried a hint of irrepressible joy.

This sword-nurturing art actually nurtured a strand of sword qi transformed from internal force.

It was far inferior to true qi. To transform his internal force into a genuine strand of sword qi, Xu Yunfan silently glanced at Pei Yan in the distant cave.

His vision was excellent, and he could clearly see the sword sheath hanging at Pei Yan's waist.

The lost divine weapon, the Green Bamboo Sword, would definitely be the best catalyst for turning internal force into sword qi. Unfortunately...

For now, it could only be called sword force.

Xu Yunfan shook his head slightly, but he couldn't say that cultivating a strand of genuine sword qi in advance was necessarily a good thing. If his physical body couldn't withstand it, frequent use would inevitably lead to serious problems.

Otherwise, Pei Yan wouldn't have ended up in such a miserable state.

When Xu Yunfan entered the cave, Pei Yan raised his eyelids. Seeing Xu Yunfan's expression, which was neither sad nor glad, he said, "The Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art is difficult to learn and master. Without the Sword Pavilion's secret medicine, even if you've already reached the Blood Transformation realm, you still need to carefully clear your meridians. Transforming internal force into threads is not..."

"The Three Cycles Sword Nurturing Art has already been mastered by me."

Xu Yunfan stated this directly. Pei Yan was momentarily stunned, then furrowed his brows and said, "Mastery isn't that easy to achieve. If you have any doubts today, you can ask..."

His voice cut off abruptly, and Pei Yan's voice became sharp.

"You've mastered it?!"

Pei Yan's blood energy surged instantly, his pale face flushing red in a moment, looking as if he were experiencing a final rally before death. The man, who had looked like a sickly creature on the verge of breathing his last, suddenly leaped up. Where was the image of a dying man, gasping for his last breath?

He took several large strides to stand before Xu Yunfan. Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed slightly. He lowered his gaze to stare at his fingertips, and the sword force lying dormant in his three jiao meridians suddenly awakened.
