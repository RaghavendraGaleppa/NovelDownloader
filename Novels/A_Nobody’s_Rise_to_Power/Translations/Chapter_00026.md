Chapter 26: The Man-Eating Tiger

Xiao Qingmei led Yang Can out of the flower hall. Her small wooden clogs clattered against the bluestone ground, sounding like a carefree little hen.

Suddenly, the scene from that rainy day flashed through her mind: Yang Can standing by the window, staring intently at her retreating figure.

Xiao Qingmei suddenly felt as if she were being watched by a hawk circling overhead. Her back itched, her bottom itched, and her legs felt weak, unsure of how to take the next step.

"Ahem, um... you go first," Xiao Qingmei finally said, stepping aside onto the roadside.

Yang Can raised an eyebrow in confusion. Xiao Qingmei kept a straight face and said, "I... told you that once we're in the outer residence, I'd give you face."

Yang Can was a bit skeptical of her explanation because a blush of peach blossom pink had risen on her cheeks—the unique color of a shy young maiden.

Yang Can didn't know what this little girl was thinking, but he decided to go along with it.

So, it became Xiao Qingmei's turn to stare at him from behind.

Hmm, he's quite tall. If someone were to lean against his chest, their mouth would probably only reach his chest level?

His shoulders look broad, yet his waist is so slender. Is this what the nannies call a "dog waist"?

It's said that men with a dog waist are very strong. Maybe it's true? After all, when I was standing guard, my feet were sore, but he was still busy tinkering inside...

Thinking of this, Xiao Qingmei's pretty face turned red again.

"Ouch!"

Xiao Qingmei was lost in thought as she walked. Suddenly, Yang Can stopped, and she couldn't stop in time, crashing right into his back.

Yang Can quickly turned around. "Are you alright?"

"Ugh, it's all your fault. You stopped suddenly without saying anything."

Xiao Qingmei rubbed her nose and glared at Yang Can. Her almond-shaped eyes were misty with moisture, looking quite alluring.

Xiao Qingmei looked behind Yang Can. "Where is this place?"

Before them was a small courtyard, shaded by green foliage. With blue bricks and dark tiles, the gate was small, but looking inside, it seemed to hold a world of its own.

Yang Can said, "This is the residence of Chief Steward Li."

Xiao Qingmei had only just arrived at the Yu family, so she wasn't familiar with the outer residence at all. Yang Can had served as Yu Chengye's private secretary for over half a year, so he had been to Li Youcai's place before.

Yang Can led Xiao Qingmei into Li Youcai's courtyard. As the chief steward of the main branch, Li Youcai had his own small compound. It wasn't large, consisting of three main rooms and two side rooms.

As soon as they entered, they saw two boys, about eleven or twelve years old, crouching under the eaves, excitedly playing "catch the sheep's ankle bone."

Sheep's ankle bones are toys made from the ankle joints of sheep's hind legs, similar to a game of jacks.

Yang Can called out loudly, "Laixi, Wangcai, is Chief Steward Li home?"

Laixi and Wangcai were the two young servants in Chief Steward Li's quarters.

Their names sounded a bit vulgar, but in this era, slaves and servants were mostly given lowly names.

In the world Yang Can originally came from, the names of servants in wealthy families were also quite crude at first.

It wasn't until the Ming and Qing dynasties that those who could afford servants began to adopt more elegant names, like Moyan, Shijiu, Xiren, Dequan...

Laixi looked up and exclaimed with joy, "Master Yang!"

He recognized the young master's secretary and quickly stood up. "Master Yang, my master is home. Master, Master Yang is here!"

Laixi craned his neck and shouted into the room. With the sound, Li Youcai, dressed in a round-collared casual robe, tall and with a beard curled like hooks, walked out of the room.

This man was probably just over fifty, with a full and ruddy face and bright eyes. He gave off a gentle and generous impression at first glance.

He naturally knew Yang Can. Standing next to Yang Can was a petite young girl with a delicate and pretty face, large eyes, and a small mouth. Even without smiling, she had a sweet air...

He also recognized her. Wasn't this the young mistress's personal maid, Qingmei?

Since Suochanzhi had moved into the main branch, Li Youcai had paid his respects to his new mistress, so he naturally knew Qingmei.

Li Youcai was slightly surprised. He quickly lifted the hem of his robe, hurried down the stone steps, and clasped his hands in greeting with a smile. "Miss Qingmei, Master Yang, what brings you two here? Please, come in."

Li Youcai ushered the two into the guest room, and Laixi and Wangcai brought in tea trays to serve tea.

The two boys' movements were quite nimble, but Qingmei glanced at their hands. They hadn't even washed their hands before making the tea, and they had just been crouching on the ground playing "catch the sheep's ankle bone."

Qingmei felt a bit disgusted and naturally wouldn't drink the tea.

Qingmei coughed once and got straight to the point. "Chief Steward Li, I was sent by the young mistress to bring Master Yang to see you."

"Oh?" Li Youcai clearly didn't know yet that Yang Can was to become the second steward of the main branch. He looked at Yang Can with some confusion.

Qingmei said, "By the Chieftain's command, Master Yang will be the second steward of the main branch from now on. The young mistress has also agreed, so I was sent to deliver the person."

"Ah? Is that so?"

Li Youcai stood up abruptly, overjoyed. "When Master Yang was the young master's advisor, we got along very well. It's wonderful that we can manage the main branch's assets together in the future."

Yang Can stood up and smiled. "I am young and have limited experience. I am entrusted with this heavy responsibility only because the Chieftain trusts me. In the future, I will need your guidance, Chief Steward."

Li Youcai stroked his hook-like beard and said with a smile, "Master Yang is too modest. From now on, we brothers will discuss and handle the affairs of the main branch. In short, we must not let the Chieftain down."

Xiao Qingmei stood up and said, "You can discuss things, but don't forget that you must report to my young mistress for instructions on everything. If you cannot manage the affairs of the main branch well, even if the Chieftain agrees, our young mistress will not."

Li Youcai was all smiles. "Of course, that is our duty. Please rest assured, Miss Qingmei."

Qingmei gave a fake smile. "Whether I am reassured or not is not important. What matters is that you must make the young mistress feel reassured."

Xiao Qingmei looked like a loyal servant to her master.

Before them were two stewards. Li Youcai was a veteran of the main branch, and Yang Can was deeply hated by the Suo family. So it was normal for Xiao Qingmei to be so aggressive.

Xiao Qingmei said, "Alright, I have matters to attend to in the inner residence. Since I have delivered the person, I will take my leave now."

Li Youcai quickly walked with Yang Can to see her out of the main hall. The two stood on the steps, watching Xiao Qingmei's "clattering" footsteps carry her out of the small courtyard.

Li Youcai stroked his curled beard left and right, clicking his tongue in admiration. "Tsk, the way that little waist sways is really something."

Hearing this, Yang Can felt a bit uncomfortable, as if someone were eyeing a dish that had already been served onto his plate.

Yang Can cleared his throat and said, "Just looking is enough, no need to praise her out loud. Be careful not to let your wife hear and get angry with you."

Although the two hadn't had much personal contact in the past, one was originally the young master's secretary and the other was the young master's chief steward, so they were quite familiar with each other.

Li Youcai laughed and said, "The day I, Li Youcai, see a beauty and can't be bothered to look is the day your sister-in-law will get angry with me. Hahaha, let's go back inside."

The two walked back to the main hall. Li Youcai called out loudly, "Xiaowan, Xiaowan, Master Yang is here."

The lady of the house had already known a guest had arrived.

After all, the house had three rooms in a row, and Mrs. Li was in the left wing, so how could she not know.

At Li Youcai's call, the door curtain was lifted, and a beautiful, slightly mature woman walked out. She had vermilion lips, phoenix eyes, and long eyebrows that swept into her hairline.

This young woman wore a lotus-pink spring jacket and a crimson silk skirt. Her cloud-like hair was half-up, and her powdered cheeks had a slight blush. Her phoenix eyes had corners that lifted slightly, giving her a somewhat "spicy" look.

This woman's surname was Pan, given name Xiaowan. She looked to be only twenty-four or twenty-five, but she was a full half younger than Li Youcai—so young she could almost be his daughter.

"So it's Master Yang who has come."

Pan Xiaowan saw it was Yang Can and her thin red lips curled slightly, as if in disdain.

"It's been some time since I last saw you, Master."

Pan Xiaowan said, performing a perfunctory curtsy. Li Youcai quickly glared at her behind Yang Can's back.

Li Youcai knew his young, pretty wife looked down on Yang Can a bit, but she should at least maintain appearances. She couldn't be so blunt, after all, they would be working together in the future.

Yang Can clasped his hands. "Greetings, Sister-in-law. I only returned from Jincheng with the young master not long after the New Year."

Pan Xiaowan let out a "tsk" of laughter and was about to speak, but Li Youcai, afraid she would say something unpleasant again, quickly pretended to be impatient. "Alright, alright, I have something to say to Master Yang. Go brew two cups of good tea."

Li Youcai glanced outside and cursed, "Laixi and Wangcai, those two clumsy oafs, can't even brew tea properly. How can they entertain a guest?"

Pan Xiaowan shot Li Youcai a sideways glance and said淡淡ly, "They're just half-grown boys, of course they're careless. It's not as meticulous as being served by a young girl."

Li Youcai's face immediately lit up with a smile. "That makes sense. Then I'll go find a slave trader tomorrow and pick out two suitable maids."

Pan Xiaowan let out a soft scoff and said to Yang Can, "Master Yang, look at this. Our master is so considerate. He drinks his own tea and lets it go cold three times, yet he's always afraid that when a distinguished guest arrives, there won't be anyone to serve them."

Her phoenix eyes glanced sideways, as if throwing out a pair of willow-leaf flying knives. She looked at Li Youcai with a half-smile. "Master, if you want to add a few more servants, that's for the family's prestige, and there's nothing wrong with that. But as the mistress of the house, I'm worried too. Our family's money box is already lighter than my own jewelry case. If you buy two more maids, I'm afraid our rice jar will be empty at once, and that would be unfair to the new girls."

As the chief steward of the prestigious Yu family's main branch, how could he not have enough savings to afford a few maids and servants?

Li Youcai knew immediately that his wife was mocking him for not being able to feed himself yet still thinking about "adding more people to the household." His old face turned red in an instant.

Pan Xiaowan wasn't done yet. She added in a sarcastic tone, "By the way, master, remember to have the poultry and egg farm send some fertilizer to the house later. The small vegetable plot in the corner of our courtyard is so poor in fertility. Tsk, even the leeks are all shriveled and dry. If we were to sprinkle more seeds, wouldn't both the old and new sprouts all wither?"

Li Youcai turned red to his ears, afraid that Yang Can would understand her veiled insults.

Li Youcai hurriedly said, "I know, I know. Look at you, with Master Yang visiting, you should be serving tea immediately, not talking about all this nonsense. Fine, fine, I'll go brew the tea myself."

With that, Li Youcai hurriedly walked out of the main hall and headed for the tea room in the side wing.

Pan Xiaowan let out a cold snort, her face stern as she watched Li Youcai leave. When she turned back to look at Yang Can's handsome face, the disdain and anger in her expression suddenly melted away, filling the room with a soft, spring-like charm.

Yang Can lowered his eyes and saw a crimson skirt float before him. Beneath the skirt, a pair of delicate embroidered shoes were faintly visible.

As Pan Xiaowan drew closer, Yang Can caught a whiff of a pleasant "Linglingxiang" fragrance.

Suddenly, a soft giggle sounded in his ear. Mrs. Pan said in an intimate voice, "Master Yang, why don't you dare look at me? Am I a man-eating tiger?"
