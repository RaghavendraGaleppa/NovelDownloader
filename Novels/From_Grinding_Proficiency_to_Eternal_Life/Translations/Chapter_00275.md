# Chapter 275: The Sect Master of the Dao Sect, Bi Yuan

Just as a faint golden marrow resonance rang out from Xu Yunfan’s body, the drunken flush on his cheeks was instantly cooled. The cups in the hands of the two men finally froze mid-air.

Although the three of them still appeared warm and friendly, as time passed, the martial prowess Xu Yunfan inadvertently revealed made Fang Mushan and Li Haomiao become increasingly cautious. Though their laughter and conversation seemed to draw them closer, they were no longer as casual as they used to be.

A Bone Marrow Cleansing Grandmaster had the qualification to establish their own sect in the Jianghu.

In the surging tides of the Jianghu, those who were once fellow passengers on the same boat would eventually become strangers.

Xu Yunfan sighed softly and was about to help the two men to a side room to rest when he suddenly heard a creak from the door.

A Taoist boy of about twelve or thirteen entered quietly. His lips were as red as if painted with vermilion, and a dot of cinnabar marked the space between his eyebrows. His moon-white Taoist robe was embroidered with silver thread depicting the clouds and patterns of the Qingwei Mountain.

The tips of his feet touched the ground without making a sound, showing that his lightness skill had reached the ultimate realm.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.

Perfection of Muscle Tempering!

At such a young age, practicing the rather difficult lightness skill, it was truly astonishing.

This was the Dao Sect deliberately showing him that they did not only have Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan; there were many elites and prodigies like dragons among them...

"Master Xu," the boy cupped his hands in a salute, his voice clear and resonant like ice spring water striking stones. "The Sect Master, True Person Bi Yuan, invites Master Xu to come up the mountain for a discussion."

A subtle change flashed across Xu Yunfan’s expression, and his fingertips unconsciously stroked the mouth of the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace.

The Qingwei Mountain Dao Sect, a top sect that had stood unshaken in Jiannan Dao for thousands of years. Its "Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock" was reputed to lock the essence, qi, and spirit to achieve a flawless true body. All previous sect masters were supreme Grandmasters of the Nine Realms of Qi Cultivation who could summon wind and rain.

He immediately regained his composure and asked with curiosity, "Your Sect Master seeks a discussion with me?"

This was truly a rare occurrence. The Dao Sect stood high above. As the master of the sect, the current Dao Sect Master had shaken the world with his reputation decades ago; even the Master of the Sword Pavilion was slightly inferior.

The current Sect Master, Bi Yuan, the phenomenon of "Purple Qi Coming from the East, Shaking the Heavens" sixty years ago was still a legend in the Jianghu.

The Sword Pavilion Master, known as "One Sword, Frosty Cold Fourteen Prefectures," only managed to last three hundred moves against Bi Yuan on the Sword Discussion Platform before admitting defeat back then.

If it weren't for the Dao Sect's habitual cultivation of their mind and nature, how could the Sword Pavilion be so glorious today?

He glanced out of the corner of his eye at the soundly sleeping Fang Mushan and Li Haomiao. The boy smiled upon seeing this and said, "Rest assured, Master Xu. These two fellow Taoists will be taken care of by the outer sect elders."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate and nodded in agreement.

The mountain path twisted and turned with eighteen bends. Xu Yunfan followed the boy up the steps of blue jade, ascending step by step.

On the branches of the ancient pines on both sides, dense talismans were embedded. Every hundred steps, an invisible barrier swept over their bodies.

Xu Yunfan was surprised in his heart; he didn't expect such invisible forces, which looked quite mystical.

The boy explained, "This is the 'Nine Locks Heart-Testing Formation.' The Sect Master only just set it up recently. It's only because the spiritual energy of heaven and earth has risen again that it has some effect. If someone with ill intentions steps in, they will be burned to a crisp by thunder and fire in an instant."

He paused and smiled, "But that's just a legend. It's already quite good if it can make the talismans tremble now."

Before he finished speaking, the dragon scale armor around Xu Yunfan's waist suddenly emitted a clanging sound. The gaps between the scales burst with赤金 light, shredding the incoming probing energy to pieces.

The boy looked back in shock, but saw Xu Yunfan casually dusting his lapels as if nothing had happened. "Apologies, this armor has quite a temper."

He really wasn't trying to show off. It was just that although the evil dragon within this Eighth-Rank Divine Weapon, the Dragon Scale Armor, had been extinguished, its remaining instincts were still extremely fiery. It would cause trouble if he wasn't careful.

The boy forced a smile at Xu Yunfan and quickly ran to the side to carefully inspect the talismans. Only after confirming that the talismans hadn't been damaged did he let out a huge sigh of relief.

All these talismans covering the mountain were pasted up by him one by one. If they were damaged, regardless of whether Xu Yunfan would be punished, he would have to go through the trouble of pasting them all over again.

It was a troublesome matter.

When they reached the mountainside, the clouds and mist suddenly parted like living things, revealing a bronze hall suspended on a sheer cliff.

On the square in front of the hall, seven black-robed Taoists were practicing sword techniques in the formation of the Big Dipper. As their sword qi crisscrossed, a phantom of a star map actually condensed in the air.

The leader suddenly stopped his sword and looked at Xu Yunfan, his gaze sharp as lightning. "Are you the true disciple of the Heavenly Work Cave, Xu Yunfan? The one who stepped into the Bone Marrow Cleansing Realm in just two years?"

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow.

Before he could answer, the boy coldly rebuked, "Senior Brother Zhou, this is the Sect Master's distinguished guest!"

Although he was a Taoist boy, it depended on whose boy he was.

The Taoist sneered and ignored him. The tip of his sword suddenly flicked up a three-zhang-long青芒, thrusting straight at Xu Yunfan's throat. It was actually the opening move of the Qingwei Mountain's secret technique, "Falling Star River"!

"Clang!"

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace leaped out from behind Xu Yunfan. With a flick of his wrist, Xu Yunfan swept the mace across, its body shrouded in the unique玉骨金声 of the Bone Marrow Cleansing Realm.

The two forces collided. Taoist Zhou retreated seven steps in a row, the long sword in his hand shattering inch by inch.

And Xu Yunfan's mace momentum didn't stop. The aftermath plowed a three-zhang-long trench into the bluestone slabs on the ground!

Xu Yunfan was a bit surprised. "You're really at the Bone Marrow Cleansing Realm?"

Hearing Xu Yunfan's doubt, Taoist Zhou's face turned pale and then green, finding it hard to save face. He beckoned with one hand, and a long sword from a Taoist beside him flew into his grasp. He was about to attack again.

At this time, the boy's face was pale with fright, but then a light laugh came from the depths of the sea of clouds. "A Bone Marrow Cleansing Realm of 'Earth Vein Forging Bones.' The Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique of the Divine Weapon Ridge does have its merits."

Pushing open the hall door, Xu Yunfan felt as if he had stepped into another world.

The dome of the hall was inlaid with three hundred and sixty night pearls, arranged according to the celestial stars.

The floor was a whole piece of Yin-Yang Fish Jade Wall. Sitting at the junction of Yin and Yang was an old man with white hair but a youthful complexion.

He wore a purple ribbon robe with star patterns. A green jade hairpin in his hair faintly had lightning wandering around it. It was precisely the Qingwei Mountain Sect Master, Bi Yuan.

Just his sitting posture caused the spiritual energy within three zhang of his surroundings to form a visible vortex. His breathing made the nine palace bells hanging from the bronze eaves of the hall chime without wind.

What a grand spectacle.

Xu Yunfan's heart tightened slightly. The muscles under his dragon scale armor instantly tensed. The spiritual energy here was abundant. The ancient array patterns carved on the bronze hall were activated, creating such a phenomenon. The ancient array patterns hidden in the walls were flickering with Bi Yuan's breathing.

"Sit."

Bi Yuan waved his sleeve, and a cushion automatically flew to Xu Yunfan's feet.

The purple clay pot on the table poured tea by itself. The tea soup condensed in mid-air into a small dragon, spiraling down into the cup.

The use of True Energy was indeed miraculous, making one feel as if possessing the power of gods and immortals.

"This tea is named 'Jade Liquid.'"

Daring to take the name of the legendary divine nectar...

Bi Yuan's fingertips lightly tapped the table. The small dragon formed by the tea soup actually swam in the cup, its scales, claws, whiskers, and hair all distinct.

"It is picked from the Nine Luminaries Spiritual Tea Tree at the peak of the ten-thousand-zhang sea of clouds in Suspended Capital State. Thirty years only yields three taels. Even the Great Zhou royal family would have to trade it for the taxes of three cities."
