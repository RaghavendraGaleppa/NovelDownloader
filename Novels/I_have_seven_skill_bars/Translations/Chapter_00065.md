# Chapter 65: Alchemy

After two months of cultivation and care, every stalk of spirit rice in Ding Rui's 520 spirit field was growing robustly, without a single mishap. Naturally, Ding Rui's cultivation was also rapidly increasing, nearing the peak of the first level of Qi Condensation.

Even more joyous news was the great progress in the merging of his five cultivation technique skills. As he used his skill slots more frequently to cultivate ingrained memories, Ding Rui had gained a rough understanding of the skill fusion's progress. He was confident that within half a month, he would be able to simultaneously cultivate all five techniques without the aid of his skill slots, completing the fusion of the five cultivation skills and freeing up a total of four skill slots.

However, even though Ding Rui had finished his work in the spirit field by evening today, he couldn't immediately begin cultivating. The Azure Bee Knight had not yet fully gained sentience, but that small patch of grain blossoms had long since bloomed and was now close to wilting. Ding Rui planned to harvest the grain blossoms before they withered and exchange them for some spirit rice at the logistics department. Only after truly starting his cultivation these past two months did he realize that the spirit rice he initially thought was sufficient was actually not as durable as he had imagined.

Ding Rui had indeed taken those words to heart. Previously, when Li Yizhen first called him to Spirit Field No. 56, and he learned about the grain blossoms and Bigu Pills, he had actually considered alchemy. But afterwards, things became too numerous. He needed to manage the spirit field, work overtime to fuse skills, and cultivate five different techniques to become a spirit farmer. Firstly, he simply didn't have the time.

Secondly, a major reason was the insufficient number of skill slots. The importance of skill slots to Ding Rui was self-evident. It was precisely because of his skill slots that he was able to become a spirit farmer, and his life after becoming a spirit farmer was incomparably better than Liu Yun's. So, with insufficient skill slots, it was naturally impossible for him to dedicate some to alchemy.

But the situation was different now. Ding Rui had firmly established himself as a spirit farmer and no longer needed to learn any new skills to fully manage the 520 spirit field on his own, with hardly any accidents occurring. Moreover, the fusion of his cultivation technique skills was nearing success, which would free up four skill slots all at once. He could completely utilize these four skill slots for other things.

For example, alchemy!

And pay the other party a certain reward! Of course, the reward wouldn't be low; one needed to have a certain amount of assets to afford it. This was indeed a very good idea. Ding Rui decided to give it a try. However, everything would have to wait until he had freed up his skill slots.

He walked back, deep in thought. When Ding Rui returned to Spirit Field 520, he found Old Huang waiting for him outside the field gate.

"Why are you here?" Ding Rui approached and saw that Old Huang was even injured. There were several shallow marks on his face, making it clear that if he had been even slightly less careful, he would have been disfigured. If his face was like this, then his body was naturally even worse.
