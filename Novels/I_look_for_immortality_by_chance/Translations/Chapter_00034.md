# Chapter 34: Golden Legend!

"The world's structure has remained unchanged for many years due to the presence of supreme beings. But now..."

"Perhaps it's time for a change."

Someone sighed deeply.

The crowd fell into contemplation.

"The Nine Rivers Marsh is formed by the convergence of nine great rivers. Each river is home to ancient exotic species with extraordinary power. Among them, the weakest are the Emerald Fire-Eyed Jade Apes of the Chiyue Great River."

"The Dao Academy's move is likely both a warning and a test."

"But what does it have to do with us? We're just disciples of the Hidden Dragon Academy, barely at the Qi Refining stage. How could we possibly contend with these Emerald Fire-Eyed Apes?"

"Fool! Do you think the Dao Academy would act without reason? It's only because a supreme being has fallen, leaving the demonic races without protection. Without that suppression, would the Emerald Fire-Eyed Jade Apes dare to challenge our Dao Academy?"

"By now, they've probably already withdrawn from the Cloud Cliff Shell Field. The academy is sending us there to test the waters and take control of the field."

"Every shell jade from the Cloud Cliff Shell Field is equivalent to a month of hard cultivation. And if it's a Shell King, it could even help you break through an entire realm."

"Didn't you hear the academy master? The academy only wants the field—meaning everything else inside is ours for the taking!"

The Green Peak Dao Academy lived up to its reputation as a major sect. Its disciples were well-versed in ancient texts, and even those at the Qi Refining stage had sharp insights. In just moments, they grasped the academy's strategy.

By sending Qi Refining disciples, the academy kept the scale of conflict manageable while subtly shifting its future direction.

After all, the more resources a sect controlled, the more prosperous it would become.

"The world is on the brink of great change. The academy is adjusting its approach to prepare for the future. This battle for the Shell Field is also a test for us!"

"If any disciple stands out during this, they might receive unexpected rewards."

Someone in the crowd declared with conviction.

This statement immediately brightened the eyes of those around them.

But just as quickly, someone sneered, "Even if the Emerald Fire-Eyed Apes don't dare to openly oppose the Dao Academy, they won't just hand over the Shell Field. There will still be dangers—survival isn't guaranteed."

"If you hesitate at every step, why even cultivate? You might as well go live as a wealthy mortal!"

Another retorted sharply.

"Hmph, the path of cultivation is long. Only by treading carefully can one reach the other shore."

"True, caution is wise."

"Shell jades aren't worth risking our lives over!"

Many disciples murmured in agreement, while the more audacious ones scoffed.

In moments, the crowd before the hall had nearly split into two factions.

---

One group sought progress through struggle, while the other preferred steady, cautious cultivation.

As the debate grew heated, Zhou Qisheng, standing before the Hidden Dragon Hall, spoke again:

"Silence!"

"Do you think the Dao Academy would force such a trivial matter? Or demand every disciple mobilize?"

"Those willing to go to the Shell Field must register on the jade ledger within three days. You may then board the Dragon Tooth Treasure Ship to the Chiyue Great River."

"Those who choose not to go will not be compelled. Three days from now, elders from the Seven Peaks will come to the Hidden Dragon Academy to lecture. All remaining disciples may attend."

With a sweep of his sleeve, Zhou Qisheng left behind a crimson-gold jade ledger before vanishing in a streak of light.

The Hidden Dragon Academy's attendants then took over to manage the arrangements.

---

"The academy is dividing us into two paths—'Conflict' and 'Preservation.'"

Gu Yuan observed the murmuring disciples and the floating crimson-gold ledger, his thoughts churning.

This was the ripple effect of the True Dragon's fall.

Without a supreme being's suppression, conflict was inevitable.

The Dao Academy was preparing for the future.

Sending Qi Refining disciples to seize the Shell Field was proof.

But a major sect would never stake everything on one gamble. The academy welcomed those who sought progress through struggle, but it also accommodated those who preferred quiet cultivation.

For the academy, both paths were acceptable.

But for disciples like Gu Yuan, a choice had to be made.

Should they stay in the mountains, slowly seeking opportunities? Or follow the academy, using battle to fuel their cultivation?

The Dao Academy's actions were always far-sighted. This decision wasn't just about the Shell Field—it would shape their future cultivation path.

"For others, this might require deliberation. But for me, the answer is clear."

Gu Yuan chuckled inwardly, then summoned his Cloud-Treading Shuttle and headed west.

---

Silverfish Island, Lakeside Bamboo House.

"Junior Brother Gu, this is the last time. The Alchemy Court will send new disciples in three days."

A burly man with a rough face handed Gu Yuan three spirit stones and a jade basin.

Inside the basin, three lively silverfish swam blissfully, unaware of their impending fate.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"

Gu Yuan accepted them with a smile.

Over the past month, while studying seals, he hadn't neglected his silverfish duties. The generous rewards were a crucial source of income.

Without them, he would have struggled long ago.

Today marked the final task.

Though he hadn't fed the fish yet, the senior brother had already handed over the payment.

After expressing his gratitude, Gu Yuan didn't linger. The man was at a critical point in his cultivation and couldn't afford distractions.

With the payment secured, Gu Yuan headed straight to the lakeside for the last feeding.

But feeding the silverfish was only one purpose of this trip.

He had a far more important goal.

When Gu Yuan had broken through to the fifth layer of Qi Refining, he'd noticed that the range of his Stone Liquid vision had expanded significantly. Even the outskirts of the Nine Rivers Marsh now glimmered faintly.

The Cloud Cliff Shell Field lay at the border of the Nine Rivers Marsh and the Chiyue Great River, not far from the Green Peak Dao Academy. That was why the academy had chosen it for this trial.

Gu Yuan's westward journey to Silverfish Island was to get closer to the marsh.

From this central location, he could observe both the marsh and the mountain gate.

While others agonized over whether to go to the Shell Field, Gu Yuan only needed one look to decide.

If the mountain gate held opportunities, he would stay. If the Shell Field shone brighter, he would go.

If neither stood out, he would remain and cultivate patiently, waiting for the next chance.

He would follow the light.

Gu Yuan took out the stone vial and let a drop of Stone Liquid fall into his eyes.

"Boom!"

In an instant, the world transformed. Stars swirled, and countless strange lines appeared before him.

Gu Yuan looked left—toward the mountain gate. Only a few sparse white dots flickered there.

Then he turned right.

"Boom!"

A dazzling golden radiance shot into the heavens, nearly blinding him.

Gold!

Golden light!
