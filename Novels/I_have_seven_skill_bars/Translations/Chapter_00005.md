# Chapter 5: Shock 377

Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!

Ding Rui heard the sound of the Golden Glow Spear colliding with the giant aphid's exoskeleton. His heart surged with excitement, and his attacks on the giant aphid became even more ferocious.

A moment later, the giant aphid fled once more. Ding Rui again left a Golden Glow Spear in place, waiting for the insect, then condensed another one and continued his search. After another fierce battle, Ding Rui left another one.

...

Soon, Ding Rui had left a total of seven Golden Glow Spears throughout the spiritual rice plant. After darting up and down, left and right, the giant aphid finally ran out of escape routes. Wherever it went, it would collide with a waiting Golden Glow Spear, which would then launch an attack. If it lingered even a moment longer, two more would pursue it from behind.

The less intelligent giant aphid didn't understand what "breaking out" meant; it only knew how to turn and run. As it turned, its path became shorter, and its running range grew smaller and smaller. Finally, it was cornered by seven Golden Glow Spears, trembling while enduring a relentless barrage of attacks. In the end, Ding Rui could no longer even feel the giant aphid's resistance.

"It looks like your spiritual consciousness isn't damaged. Could it be that there wasn't a giant aphid in this plant after all? Or..." Liu Yun asked, a hint of doubt in his eyes.

Ding Rui didn't hide the fact that he could kill giant aphids. In the past two years, he hadn't witnessed much scheming; mutual aid among cultivators was the norm. Moreover, disciples with certain talents would be highly valued by the sect and receive more resources. The sect would not hinder any cultivator's brilliance. Of course, he kept the matter of his skill slots a secret.

"You can deal with giant aphids!"

"Really?"

"I've never heard of a Qi Condensation cultivator being able to deal with giant aphids!"

"This will surely shock the sect!"

Everyone was overjoyed upon hearing this. Only Liu Yun remained relatively calm. Being more knowledgeable, he explained to those around him, "Actually, giant aphids aren't entirely unkillable. Foundation Establishment cultivators can easily deal with them, but Foundation Establishment cultivators are too busy with more important matters and naturally won't waste their time on spiritual fields. Qi Condensation cultivators could theoretically solve this problem too, but they would need the talent for multitasking, or even multi-use, and their talent in the *Golden Glow Art* would have to be incredibly strong. It's an extremely difficult feat, almost impossible, but it now seems that Little Ding's two talents are undoubtedly formidable." Liu Yun looked very pleased.

Previously, Ding Rui had been something of a freeloader, so his harvest was naturally not very good. If not for Liu Yun's extraordinary talent in the *Rain Dew Art*, where a single rain-summoning could compare to two or three attempts by an ordinary person, allowing him to earn extra money and often provide spiritual rice to help others achieve breakthroughs, then perhaps all the cultivators in their 377 spiritual field would have fallen behind in their cultivation. In this world, cultivation and cultivation level were paramount. Only with a high cultivation level could one live longer and have more hope. Thus, despite their busy lives and poor treatment, they absolutely dared not neglect their cultivation.

Liu Yun, still smiling broadly nearby, nonetheless offered a word of caution: "Little Ding, is your cultivation method truly stable? Don't overexert yourself. With your talent, you can definitely reach greater heights. Don't sacrifice the big picture for a small gain." As soon as he said this, Old Huang and the others nodded repeatedly.
