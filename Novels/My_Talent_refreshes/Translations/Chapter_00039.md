# Chapter 39: The Value of Seven-Star Spirit Fruit

"Could this Seven-Star Spirit Fruit be from Old Man Sun, auctioned through Yunhai Pavilion?"  

Chu Ning stared at the spirit fruit on the stage, suspicion growing in his heart. After some thought, he realized it was highly possible.  

Although he had encountered two Seven-Star Spirit Fruits in a short time, according to records, these fruits were rare due to their brief growth period.  

Old Man Sun's Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, based on Chu Ning's previous use of the Verdant Spring Technique, should have ripened three months ago. It made sense to sell it now.  

With this thought, Chu Ning focused on the stage. He still had one of these fruits growing in his courtyard. While he knew they were valuable, he wasn't sure exactly how much they were worth.  

Sikong Lan began introducing the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit:  

"The Seven-Star Spirit Fruit has an extremely short maturation period—just a few months—and typically grows only in areas with exceptionally dense spiritual energy.  

These fruits absorb spiritual energy rapidly, and once ripe, they fall off the plant within five days. If the fruit touches the ground, the flesh rots immediately, leaving only the seeds. If the seeds aren't promptly collected and stored in a jade box, they too will decay.  

Thus, while cultivating these fruits isn't difficult, they rarely appear in the wild because obtaining the seeds requires extraordinary luck."  

Sikong Lan paused before continuing:  

"The Seven-Star Spirit Fruit is an excellent medicinal resource for body cultivators. It’s highly effective even for Foundation Establishment cultivators seeking breakthroughs.  

The exact effects are hard to quantify, but those familiar with its properties understand its worth. The starting bid is 600 spirit stones, with increments of no less than 50 spirit stones!"  

She then added with a smile, "You may have heard that we auctioned another Seven-Star Spirit Fruit recently. This is the last one available—Yunhai Pavilion won’t have any more for sale in the near future."  

Her deliberate attempt to drive up the price sparked murmurs throughout the crowd. Even Qiu Shunyi and Lü Xingyuan beside Chu Ning began discussing it.  

"Another Seven-Star Spirit Fruit! I heard the last one sold for 1,000 spirit stones. I wonder how much this one will fetch."  

"I think it might go even higher. On my way here, I noticed several body cultivators arriving. The competition could be fiercer this time."  

As Chu Ning listened to the chatter, his expression remained calm, but his mind was anything but.  

If Yunhai Pavilion had auctioned another Seven-Star Spirit Fruit before, it was almost certainly from Old Man Sun.  

And the fruit was far more valuable than he had imagined—a single one was worth as much as the talisman-making manual he had seen earlier. The records about its rarity were clearly accurate.  

"700 spirit stones!"  

A voice called out from the east side of the second floor.  

"750!" came a counteroffer from the southeast.  

"800!"  

"850!"  

"900!"  

Bids rose rapidly, with at least five private rooms competing. The price climbed steadily.  

"1,000 spirit stones!"  

Soon, the bid reached four digits, but the competition didn’t stop.  

"1,050!"  

Then, from directly opposite the stage, a voice declared:  

"1,200 spirit stones!"  

The sudden jump of 150 spirit stones caused a stir. The other bidders hesitated momentarily.  

But after a brief pause, another voice called:  

"1,250!"  

"1,500!"  

The same bidder from before raised the price dramatically again. The crowd murmured in astonishment, many turning to look at the private room where the bid had originated. However, the room's privacy barrier prevented anyone from seeing inside.  

After a brief silence, Sikong Lan smiled and asked, "1,500 spirit stones—does anyone wish to bid higher?"  

The bidder's overwhelming display of wealth seemed to deter further competition. With no new offers, Sikong Lan announced the sale of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit for 1,500 spirit stones.  

The crowd buzzed with excitement.  

Chu Ning, meanwhile, felt his heart race.  

A single Seven-Star Spirit Fruit had sold for 1,500 spirit stones!  

While Yunhai Pavilion's marketing and Sikong Lan's skillful auctioneering had contributed to the high price, the fruit's inherent value was undeniable.  

And in Chu Ning's courtyard, seven more of these fruits were growing—worth over 10,000 spirit stones in total!  

Even if he sold them directly rather than at auction, they would still fetch at least 7,000 to 8,000 spirit stones.  

Moreover, the fruits he had nurtured with the Verdant Spring Technique were of even higher quality than Old Man Sun's.  

But as excitement gave way to caution, Chu Ning realized the danger of his situation.  

The saying "a man's wealth is his ruin" rang true—if others learned that a mere mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator possessed seven Seven-Star Spirit Fruits, the consequences would be dire.  

Though his courtyard was secluded, he couldn't shake his unease.  

Taking a deep breath, Chu Ning forced himself to remain composed, showing no outward reaction as he continued watching the auction with Qiu Shunyi and the others.  

However, his mind was no longer on the event.  

All he wanted was for the auction to end so he could return to the sect and check on his precious fruits.  

Fortunately, only a few more items were auctioned before Sikong Lan concluded the event.  

Relieved, Chu Ning quickly stood and urged Qiu Shunyi to leave.  

"Weren't you planning to buy talisman paper?" Qiu Shunyi asked, looking puzzled.  

"We can get some outside. It's too crowded here," Chu Ning replied casually.  

Qiu Shunyi and Lü Xingyuan agreed. As they walked out, Qiu Shunyi added,  

"If we hurry, we might catch a ride back to the sect with one of the elders at the market entrance."  

Chu Ning blinked in surprise. "Elders return from the market?"  

Qiu Shunyi nodded. "Yunhai Pavilion's auctions attract many outsiders, so the sect often sends senior disciples or elders to maintain order. Most stay until the market closes in the afternoon, but a few leave earlier."  

Hearing this, Chu Ning wasted no time. After purchasing some talisman paper and jade boxes from nearby shops, the three quickly made their way to the market's entrance.  

Not long after they arrived, Yuan Guang and five others appeared.  

As Qiu Shunyi greeted them, Chen Youdao—standing beside Yuan Guang—was about to speak to Chu Ning when a figure suddenly landed before them.  

"Returning to the sect?"  

It was Elder Chen from the Transmission Hall, the same kindly elder who had welcomed them into the sect. His spirit vessel hovered nearby.  

"Elder Chen!"  

Chu Ning and the others bowed respectfully.  

With a nod, Elder Chen gestured for them to board. Once all nine were aboard, he cast a protective barrier around them, and the vessel soared into the sky, heading for Qingxi Sect.  

Chu Ning finally relaxed.  

With a Transmission Hall elder escorting them, there was no need to worry about any mishaps on the journey.  

As the spirit vessel flew, Elder Chen glanced at them and remarked,  

"If I recall correctly, you’re all new disciples who joined within the last year, aren’t you?"
