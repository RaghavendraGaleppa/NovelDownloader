# Chapter 397: The Great Tomb Beneath Broken Axe Mountain? Jiang Chulong Breaks Through (1/2)

Inside the Governor's Mansion of Ziyang Prefecture.

The young man, still dressed in his pale moon-white Confucian robe, sat in his study flipping through county records. He looked more like a scholar than the overbearing Crown Prince of the Great Yu Dynasty.

He looked up as Qingque entered with Danhong, whose face was deathly pale, and said indifferently, "You returned faster than I expected."

Qingque lowered her head and whispered, "Something happened."

"Speak."

Jiang Yu continued to flip through the county records. As Qingque reported what had just transpired, the sound of rustling pages gradually slowed.

"You're saying that Ying Bing broke your combined attack with a single sword strike?" Jiang Yu frowned and looked up.

Qingque nodded and glanced at the woman in the pink skirt beside her. "Danhong's Sword Heart has likely developed a Heart Demon. She will never make progress in the Sword Dao again..."

Jiang Yu, however, seemed indifferent to this and merely murmured, "In that case, it seems the Fifth on the Hidden Dragon List is actually stronger than the Fourth?"

"Your Highness! I can never practice the sword again."

Danhong wept pitifully, hoping the Crown Prince would stand up for her and seek revenge. "She didn't just cripple me; she slapped you in the face."

Jiang Yu's expression remained cold and impassive. "Understood. Return to Tianshan Sword Manor. There is still a spot open for compiling the Sword Canon."

"Get out."

Danhong looked at the Crown Prince, whom she had served for six years, in disbelief. His cold indifference was exactly the same as how he treated the little princess.

Qingque led her out of the courtyard. Once they were outside, Danhong finally let out a bitter smile. "Yes, the royal family is heartless. What am I, anyway..."

"Danhong, returning to the manor to compile the Sword Canon isn't a bad way out. If it weren't for the prior arrangement, it's something ordinary people would beg for but couldn't get."

Qingque's words carried a hidden meaning.

The spots for compiling the Sword Canon were limited and required prior arrangement, which meant His Highness had long known that Danhong's impetuous and arrogant nature would eventually lead to such a calamity, hence he made this arrangement.

If she could settle her heart and return to the manor to compile the texts, she might be able to break through and be reborn in the future.

Unfortunately, Danhong didn't hear the warning in her words. Her涣散 (dissipating) gaze condensed again, and hatred seemed to burn within her.

"As long as the Heart Demon isn't removed... I'll be a cripple for life..."

........

Autumn Water Pavilion.

Dusk was fading, the sky the color of tears, the afterglow dyeing the small Autumn Water Pavilion with magnificent hues.

The food had just been served when Elder Qian arrived at Autumn Water Pavilion as if on cue.

Shang Wu asked warily, "Elder Qian, have you eaten?"

"What a coincidence, no, I haven't."

"Then go back and eat first before coming back."

"???"

The short, plump Elder Qian had a question mark rising above his head. Based on his years of experience in freeloading, the response to "Have you eaten?" shouldn't be "Why don't you join us if you haven't?" but rather "No, let's eat together."

Elder Qian looked displeasedly at Li Mo and Ying Bing, who were sitting at the table. "Eating? How could I possibly have an appetite these past two days? Look at these dark circles, look at this belly."

"Our Qingyuan Sect has taken in these two disciples; I'm going to lose ten years of my life!"

On the surface, this matter was considered settled.

Elder Qian's resentment was as heavy as that of a young wife who had been wronged.

It made Li Mo feel quite embarrassed, so he quickly added a pair of chopsticks.

But Elder Qian waved his hand, acting coquettishly to say that late love is cheaper than grass, so he wouldn't eat either!

"I, Old Qian, would rather starve to death or die outside than eat a single bite of your food!"

"Alright."

Li Mo felt these words sounded familiar, then asked, "Since you aren't here to freeload, then..."

"Since we can't catch a ride with the Crown Prince to Broken Axe Mountain anymore, what are your plans, you and Little Bing'er?"

"We're still sticking to the plan, setting off tomorrow."

Li Mo and Ying Bing had never intended to travel with Jiang Yu anyway.

"The anomalies at Broken Axe Mountain today have weakened. I just came back from gathering intelligence there."

Elder Qian wasn't surprised by this. He sighed and swallowed a mouthful of saliva. "There were still anomalies today?"

---

Li Mo raised an eyebrow and took a bite of braised land-fish meat.

But he hadn't gone to Broken Axe Mountain today.

That meant those were the inherent anomalies of Broken Axe Mountain itself.

"Yeah, the anomalies have weakened a lot. The commotion was so huge before, who knew it would flop today."

Elder Qian smacked his lips and described today's anomalies.

Today at Broken Axe Mountain, there was a sign of the Five Elements and Feng Shui reversing. The anomalies weren't weak, just not as earth-shattering as before.

"After the Five Elements reversed, the anomaly reflected a vividly lifelike city."

"By the way, looking at it now, what lies beneath Broken Axe Mountain might not necessarily be a cave dwelling."

"Then it is..."

"It might be the great tomb of some powerful figure," Elder Qian said with a grave expression.

A tomb?

A miraculous city reflected after the reversal of the Five Elements?

Ying Bing, who was holding her chopsticks, suddenly paused, and her beautiful eyes filled with deep thought.

From what Elder Qian said, the anomaly sounded somewhat like the... Heavenly Phoenix Domain within the Nine Souls of the Primordial Phoenix?

But the Heavenly Phoenix Domain clearly wasn't there.

If the real Heavenly Phoenix Domain was at Broken Axe Mountain, then what exactly was the one she obtained in her previous life?

"Tombs are different from inheritances. Inheritances are mainly for testing, while tombs are more dangerous. After all, no powerful figure hopes to have their body desecrated after death."

"That's why I have some private collections that it's time to take out."

Elder Qian opened his spatial artifact.

"The Sect says Elder Qian has a wide range of knowledge. I wonder what you've prepared?"

Although Little Li was wealthy and generous, he wouldn't dare say he had everything under the sun.

*Clatter—*

A black hoof fell onto the table.

"A black donkey hoof?"

"Precisely. This item is extremely effective against corpse demons."

Elder Qian simply poured everything out all at once.

Corpse-suppressing Talismans...

Misfortune-Dispelling Bells...

Senior Brother Ouyang's picture book...

Hmm?

"This..."

Li Mo picked up the picture book and found it was a collector's edition. What use would this thing be inside a great tomb?

Elder Qian cleared his throat. "Ouyang said it was for you to relieve boredom on the road, but indulging in such things ruins one's ambition, so I confiscated it."

As he spoke, he stuffed the picture book back into his spatial artifact. Then, too lazy to introduce everything one by one, he shoved everything into Li Mo's hands, waved his sleeves, and left after finishing his business.

"Senior Brother Ouyang gave it to you?"

Li Mo looked at the empty bowls on the table.

This statement was just like Elder Qian saying he wouldn't take a single bite...

.....

Nightfall.

After cooking dinner again, Li Mo sat in the courtyard and began to contemplate the Great Saint Divine Intent and the Lunar Divine Intent. The ice lump seemed to be contemplating another form of the Hundred Birds Divine Shape.

Little Li had to practice on his own.

While bathing in the Lunar energy, he calculated his current progress.

Before reaching the Inner Scene, both the Great Saint Divine Intent and the Lunar Divine Intent needed to be perfected.

But the progress of the former was clearly far behind the latter.

After a long while, late into the night.

A fluctuation came from the Little World. He returned to his room, lay down on the bed, and entered the Little World.

On the Yin-Yang Field, Jiang Chulong was holding a peach branch, waiting there.

Little Jiang Princess said softly, "Teacher, I think I can defeat Senior Golden Crow today."

"And then... and then... I'm about to break through."
