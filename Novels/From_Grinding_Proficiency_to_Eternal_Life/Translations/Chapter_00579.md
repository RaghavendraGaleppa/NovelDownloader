# Chapter 579: Heavenly River

The swordsman from the Wansheng Sword Sect revealed a cold, mocking sneer.

Close-quarters combat?

The Wansheng Sword Sect's cultivators were masters of both distant and close-range combat, their swordsmanship reaching the level of divinity. How could they fear an opponent getting close?

Subconsciously, he twisted his wrist and changed his stance. The flying sword in his hand, Reverse Scale, was as thin as a cicada's wing and radiated a chilling light. Like a viper's tongue flicking out, it abandoned its original killing thrust and instead slashed towards Xu Yunfan's throat.

The blade cut through the air with a piercing shriek.

However, it was all too late.

Xu Yunfan's fist had already been thrown.

The swordsman's expression changed drastically. He never expected Xu Yunfan to be so fast.

The fist moved without a sound, yet it carried with it an immense, boundless force and an internally contained, ultimate explosive thunder.

It was simple and straightforward, thrust straight forward.

His fist, its skin flowing with a luster that did not seem like flesh and blood, resembled a cast of divine iron.

Ahead of the fist, the air was compressed to its limit, releasing a muffled, heart-pounding boom.

There was no dazzling magical light, only pure, terrifying physical force and the faint, golden-purple arcs of thunder that were forcibly constrained to the surface of the fist, spinning and shrieking at high speed.

Fist met sword.

*Clang!*

*CRACK!*

An extremely grating sound of metal shattering exploded.

The Reverse Scale sword, as thin as a cicada's wing and sharp enough to cut through gold and jade, upon touching Xu Yunfan's bare fist, felt as if it had crashed into the very center of the world.

The powerful sword intent condensed on the blade and the sharp spiritual energy that filled it were shattered and disintegrated from the point of contact by a brutal, domineering, and unreasonable force, along with the faint but destruction-wielding golden-purple thunder aura.

The swordsman felt an indescribable, primordial force surge up the sword and into his arm.

*Puff! Puff! Puff!*

The protective sword aura he had condensed burst like a soap bubble.

The sound of clear bone fractures came from his sword-wrist. The pain had just begun when the colossal force had already traveled destructively to his shoulder and torso.

"Ugh!"

Blood mixed with fragments of internal organs gushed from his mouth.

The last image in his eyes was that fist, which had shattered his flying sword and broken through all his defenses, its speed undiminished as it slammed towards his chest, carrying a storm of destruction.

*BOOM!*

The fist landed solidly on the swordsman's chest.

There was no trickery, only the unleashing of domineering force.

The cloud-patterned sword robe on the swordsman's back suddenly exploded. A clear fist print bulged from the position of his spine.

He was sent flying backwards, his body arched like a tattered sack of grain, and crashed into a giant bronze cauldron that was already half-burnt.

The cauldron shattered, and flames splashed.

The swordsman was embedded in the scorching fragments of the cauldron wall and the spilled ash and medicinal dregs. His chest was completely caved in, his muscles and bones shattered, and blood flowed from his seven orifices. The light in his eyes instantly dispersed.

The sword seed in his Dantian let out a mournful cry, its spiritual light dimming as it shattered piece by piece.

His life force, like a candle in the wind, was extinguished in an instant.

Xu Yunfan retracted his fist, his breath steady. The violent power surrounding him instantly concealed itself, leaving only a faint afterglow of thunder aura flowing beneath his skin.

"You are the first to experience my close-quarters combat since I perfected my cultivation. Consider it your fortune."

Hearing Xu Yunfan's words, the dying swordsman's eyes widened. His trembling lips tried to form words, but when he opened his mouth, he spat out great mouthfuls of crimson blood.

That single punch had nearly extinguished his life force, scattering all his magical power and sword intent.

"Truly a fine piece of uncut jade. It will be a perfect addition to my Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner for a new Star Lord."

He beckoned with his hand, and an invisible suction force卷起 the swordsman's corpse and his shattered spiritual sword, bringing them before him.

A light flashed in his hand, and the Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner appeared.

The banner's surface was dark and deep, dotted with countless stars.

He channeled his magical power, and the banner unfurled like a giant mouth. A powerful force to restrain and吸摄 souls enveloped the swordsman's corpse.

In an instant, the residual essence blood from the swordsman's body, the still-scattering fragments of his spiritual consciousness, and even the remaining sharp sword intent from the shattered spiritual sword were all forcibly stripped away. They transformed into a stream of light mixed with a cyan-gold luster and were pulled into the banner with a wailing shriek.

On the banner's surface, another new star point appeared. Its color was like a cold, icy star, and within it, the shadow of a sword flowed, its vicious intent not yet消散.

The sword foundation and soul of that Wansheng Sword Sect's Foundation Establishment true cultivator had become a new sacrifice for the Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner.

Watching the swordsman appear in the banner, kowtowing to him three times with a respectful expression.

"I had three layers of concealment methods. How did you discover me?"

The swordsman's name was Fei Lun. Hearing Xu Yunfan's question, now a banner spirit, he dared not hesitate and immediately replied.

"Reporting to the Venerable One, I cultivated the Wansheng Sword Art to forge a sword heart of clarity. Later, using the Clarity-Refining Consciousness Sword Path, I achieved a true-seeing sword intent and condensed the Chengtian Sword Seat. I am extremely sensitive to the threads of heaven's will and karma, so I could sense minute fluctuations."

Fei Lun's expression now carried a hint of shame. "I have disturbed the Venerable One."

"It is of no matter."

A faint smile touched Xu Yunfan's lips. This Ten Thousand Soul Banner was truly a mind-washing divine artifact. Once someone entered, even a person who hated him to the bones could be turned into a fanatic.

At this rate, it wouldn't be long before he could gather the three hundred and sixty-five Star Lords.

Once he formed the Great Zhou Tian Star Constellation Array, this Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner could be called the Zhou Tian Star Lord Banner, and it might even achieve the quality of a spiritual treasure.

After all, as a supreme treasure of the demonic path, the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, once created, could be continuously refined by feeding it various heavenly treasures and rare materials, allowing it to be a magic treasure with room for growth.

He then put away the soul banner, and Xu Yunfan's figure did not pause.

High above outside the hall, the pure light barrier representing the last of the Heavenly Emperor's power was violently twisting, letting out a grating groan as it shook the heavens.

The Dao Realm projection of the Universal Salvation True Lord almost completely covered that patch of sky. The Judgment Sword of the Clear Source True Lord and the Colorless Sword Light of the Dongxu True Lord intertwined and shone.

The Heavenly Emperor of this world's realm was at his end.

He had to抓紧 time.

The Dao Fruit of this world was right before his eyes. Though the True Lords disdained such heavenly treasures and rare materials...

一旦 they finished devouring and dividing the Dao Fruit, it was very likely that some of the True Lords, having eaten their fill, would come strolling over.

Xu Yunfan no longer delayed. He identified his direction and plunged deeper into the Heavenly Court.

His figure穿梭 through the continuous ruins and collapsed immortal palaces, like a phantom in the shadows.

Along the way, he sensed several fluctuations of treasure auras, but they were mostly mid-grade magic treasures or consumable spiritual materials, which he now looked down upon. His goal was the depths of the forbidden area behind the Heavenly Emperor's Palace.

That place connected to the origin of the heavens, the cradle of the Heavenly River.

He flew all the way, and the terrain suddenly opened up, yet it was一片狼藉 (a scene of devastation).

What should have been a region of vast star rivers surrounded by exquisite palaces of jade and carved railings was now a sea of shattered palaces, with the immortal jade beneath his feet cracked and upheaved.

Ahead, in the void, a river composed of endless faint starlight and some kind of mysterious water vapor flowed torrentially. However, the edges of this Heavenly River were violently trembling and collapsing. The flowing star-sand continuously fell into the void rifts, creating destructive spatial ripples.

And by a relatively calm shoal of the Heavenly River, formed by accumulated star-sand, Xu Yunfan's gaze suddenly froze.

A figure lay collapsed on the shattered star-sand, its aura weak.

It was a woman, dressed in a palace gown that was already torn and soaked in dark golden divine blood.
