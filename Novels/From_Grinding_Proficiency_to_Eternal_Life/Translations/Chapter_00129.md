# Chapter 129: Counter-Slaying

The old man's pupils constricted violently. His fingers could easily pierce metal and shatter stone, and his claw force could crush fine iron with a mere squeeze.

Yet, they had only sunk slightly into Xu Yunfan's shoulder and neck before being squeezed out by the latter's muscle bundles, which felt as tight as steel wire cables.

How was this possible?!

Even though the opponent was at the second level of Body Tempering, perfected, and he was at the Flesh Refining realm, Large Success stage, with his refined claw techniques, he couldn't even tear off a scrap of skin or flesh.

"Your Flesh Refining realm..."

Xu Yunfan raised his head, his eyes carrying a depth that made the purple-robed old man's heart tremble slightly. The blood energy within his body rose rapidly; the hormones in his organs surged, making the purple-robed old man feel an even greater sense of danger.

The opponent's strength had far exceeded that of an ordinary third-level Body Tempering martial master.

"Is it watered down? So powerless?"

As Xu Yunfan's voice fell, the purple-robed old man let out a muffled groan. The arm holding the nine-section whip yanked hard, tearing the entire roof beam in two.

In an instant, the crossbeams and tiles on the roof poured down with a clatter, burying everyone.

*Boom!*

The next moment, a muffled, drum-like thunderclap exploded on the third floor of the Cuibo Tower.

Xu Yunfan gripped the heavy hammer, twisted his waist and abdomen, and brought the hammer down with a move called "Tianhe Reversed," smashing it heavily onto the ruins before him.

As the air buzzed and churned, the handle of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer began to glow with magma-like patterns under Xu Yunfan's blood energy. The hammerhead flickered with arcs of electricity, wandering and interweaving.

The purple-robed old man had just shaken off the scattered debris covering him when he looked up to see the heavy hammer falling right at him.

A beast-like roar erupted from his throat. He crossed his arms, and the nine-section whip, like a python coiling in the air, wrapped around his arms to block the descending Thunderfire Qilin Hammer.

The instant the hammerhead struck the steel whip, the entire floor of the Cuibo Tower's third level collapsed with a thunderous crash. The elegantly built Cuibo Tower was damaged by more than half from this single hammer blow.

Fortunately, as the Incense Fire Sect disciples had flooded in, the dining guests had long since departed. Aside from the rotating disciples of the Tiangong Cave, only Xu Yunfan and Yan Yuwei remained.

Xu Yunfan's latissimus dorsi surged like angry waves. Leveraging the momentum of the fall, he pressed the heavy hammer down another half-inch. The magma patterns on the hammer face seared into the steel whip, actually heating the cold iron forged whip segments to a glowing red!

*Crack!*

At this moment, the purple-robed old man's muscles and veins bulged. The loose clothes on his body were torn apart, revealing the deep purple veins beneath his skin. The crossbeam under his feet could no longer withstand the sudden strain and snapped.

His legs spread apart; his purple-black feet shattered his shoes, crushing the flying wood chips. His five toes hooked onto the load-bearing pillar like iron hooks.

As five grooves were scraped into the blue lacquer of the pillar, the purple-robed old man roared and pushed sideways with all his might, finally managing to deflect the falling heavy hammer.

Then, with a slight flick of his wrist, the nine-section whip snaked up toward Xu Yunfan's waist like a viper.

The moment the barbs tore through the linen robe, Xu Yunfan's abdominal muscles suddenly contracted like an iron plate, hardening to trap the poison thorns within his muscle bundles.

The purple-robed old man was shaken once again.

"Hardened body training to this extent?"

The nine-section whip in his hand was a mid-grade sharp weapon, yet it couldn't penetrate the opponent's body. How could this not shock him?

He was in the Flesh Refining realm, yet he was being suppressed by a third-level Body Tempering martial master. How could he not feel stifled?

Even if the opponent was at the second level of Body Tempering, perfected, it shouldn't have been enough to leave him so restricted.

"Is this all the bite of the Flesh Refining realm?"

Xu Yunfan's expression was cold. He spun around, the airflow generated by the heavy hammer shattering the wooden debris filling the air.

The next moment, his left hand shot out and grabbed the nine-section whip that was trying to retract. The arm holding the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swelled with muscle; the veins on his arm jumped like green pythons. Faint bloodlines appeared between his bulging muscles. Tendon, muscle, and bone worked in unison to swing in a half-moon arc. The wind from the hammer swept past, the air shrieked like a cicada, as if the very air of the entire Cuibo Tower was vibrating and humming.

It seemed as if the entire building was shaking along with it.

The old man's defense with the steel whip was a fraction too slow. The heavy hammer grazed his left shoulder. If not for his muscles undulating like waves to disperse the force in time, his left arm would have been shattered.

Xu Yunfan's heavy hammer continued along its trajectory. He twisted his body and smashed two black-clad men who were trying to climb up, sending them flying backward like rag dolls.

Yan Yuwei, who had just crawled out of the ruins nearby, didn't even look back at this scene. She immediately darted through a large hole next to her and rushed down to the second floor. Wielding her long-handled straight saber like a hungry tiger descending the mountain, she pounced on the Incense Fire Sect disciples, instantly nailing three crossbowmen, along with their weapons, into the floor tiles.

"You little wench is looking for death!"

Seeing the Incense Fire Sect disciples being mowed down like grass, the old man flew into a rage and swept his whip horizontally. However, before the nine-section whip could complete its arc, Xu Yunfan tossed the hammer. The handle of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer transformed into a chain, tangling with the nine-section whip.

As the two locked in a contest of strength, the chain and the steel whip rubbed against each other, producing a series of sparks that actually wove a net of fire in the air.

The purple-robed old man's expression didn't change, but he was horrified to discover that his strength was actually inferior to Xu Yunfan's.

Xu Yunfan suddenly let go and leaned back. The hammer chain struck the old man's face like a viper's tail, the hammerhead plowing a bloody trench into his cheek.

Seeing this, the purple-robed old man had to shake the nine-section whip in his hand, refusing to entangle with Xu Yunfan's chain hammer any longer.

He leaped up to dodge, but saw Xu Yunfan scaling a pillar like a gecko. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer suddenly burst forth with a three-foot aura, sweeping toward him!

*Bang!*

The two smashed through the third-floor floorboards, crashing into the second-floor banquet hall amidst falling bricks and stones.

The moment the old man's back hit the ground, Xu Yunfan's knee was already thrusting toward his chest's Tanzhong acupoint.

The old man's chest muscles suddenly writhed like living things; the Tanzhong acupoint actually shifted half an inch. With a muffled groan, he barely avoided this fatal blow.

"Shifting Acupoints?"

After reaching the Flesh Refining realm, one's entire body's flesh and blood were permeated with劲 (force). By writhing one's muscles, one could shift vital points. Furthermore, depending on the martial arts practiced, the body would undergo structural changes to varying degrees.

Xu Yunfan's change of technique was incredibly fast, turning a knee strike into an elbow blow. Every move and style carried the explosive force of the Cicada Silk Technique, Copper Body Skill, and Fleetfoot Technique.

When the iron elbow struck the old man's collarbone, the old man caught the descending elbow with one hand.

Seizing the opportunity, the old man whipped the steel鞭 back. The whip tip's poison thorn stabbed toward Xu Yunfan's temple. However, Xu Yunfan didn't turn his head; instead, he opened his mouth wide and bit down hard with his teeth!

The purple-robed old man's eyes twitched slightly at this sight. He had thought Xu Yunfan's teeth would shatter, but he hadn't expected the latter to have a mouthful of steel teeth. The moment he bit down, sparks even flew out.

*Crack!*

The window lattice on the second floor suddenly shattered. Yan Yuwei crashed through the glass and entered the fray.

Her right arm's muscles were twisted and gnarled like old tree roots. The long-handled saber in her hand emitted several crisp clicks of mechanism springs; the three-foot straight blade shot out even further, hacking heavily toward the purple-robed old man's neck.

Yan Yuwei's blood energy was boiling at this moment, her face carrying an extremely excited, twisted expression.

A third-level Body Tempering martial master counter-killing a Flesh Refining realm expert.

If this got out, she would surely become famous throughout the world!

The purple-robed old man's eyes shifted slightly. The fingers holding the nine-section whip trembled faintly. A cold, shivering force shook through the whip. The middle section of the nine-section whip sprang up, knocking Yan Yuwei's saber away. Its momentum didn't stop, whipping heavily against her body.
