# Chapter 9: Preparing for Rainy Days  

Night passed, and a new day arrived.  

Wei Qian ceased his cultivation, opened his eyes, and exhaled a long, turbid breath.  

"I can already feel the bottleneck. That means with seven or eight more days of diligent cultivation, I should be able to break through and reach the third level of Qi Refining."  

Knowing that his breakthrough wasn't far off, Wei Qian abandoned the idea of using the [Wishing Dragon Pearl].  

"Before, when I didn’t use my other wishes, I always wished to further improve my spiritual root aptitude."  

"But the feedback from the Dragon Pearl was that it would take ten thousand days of accumulated wishes to elevate my mid-grade spiritual root to a high-grade one."  

Ten thousand days—that was a little over twenty-seven years.  

"I can't keep wishing to improve my spiritual roots. I have to attend that auction in a month, so I need to make some preparations."  

With that in mind, Wei Qian pulled out an iron spike from his belongings.  

When cultivators engage in combat, they typically refine magical weapons—swords, spears, axes, hooks, and the like.  

But as a rogue cultivator, Wei Qian didn’t have the luxury of abundant spirit stones to purchase such artifacts. He had to improvise.  

Back in the mortal world, he had sought out a few grave robbers and bought seven coffin nails from them. After smelting and reforging them, he crafted this spike in his hand, which barely qualified as a low-grade magical weapon.  

To enhance its lethality, the simplest method was to poison it.  

He made a trip to the foot of Misty Ridge Mountain and purchased some common medicinal herbs from an apothecary in a mortal town. After brewing them, he produced a pot of eerie blue poison.  

For the mortal world, this toxin was already incredibly potent—a single drop could easily kill a grown man.  

But to use it against cultivators, it wasn’t enough. If the opponent had even a single detoxification pill, they could suppress the otherwise fatal poison.  

If quality wasn’t enough, he would make up for it with wishes.  

Wei Qian submerged the spike—now dubbed the "Death's Door Nail"—into a jar filled with the poison.  

At the same time, he focused his mind and entered the chaotic space where the [Wishing Dragon Pearl] resided.  

"Dragon Pearl, I wish that after being poisoned, the Death's Door Nail will be potent enough to kill a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator instantly."  

The feedback from the void immediately informed him that it would take ten days of accumulated wishes to enhance the poison's potency once.  

"A month is enough for three enhancements."  

Three enhancements would be sufficient to instantly kill a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator upon injury. Even if the enemy was at the late-stage Qi Refining realm, it would still inflict severe damage.  

As for the possibility of facing a Foundation Establishment expert, Wei Qian didn’t even consider it.  

At his current level, going up against a Foundation Establishment cultivator would be no different from courting death.  

"I can’t waste the twenty spirit stones Li Wanqing gave me either."  

Wei Qian turned his attention to talismans.  

In battle, a simple infusion of spiritual energy could unleash an additional spell attack or defense—this was far too valuable and cost-effective to ignore.  

As a rogue cultivator, Wei Qian had heard that sometimes, in fights between fellow rogues, the side with just one extra talisman could decide life or death.  

When it came to buying talismans, Wei Qian thought it over and decided to seek out Li Guchen again.  

At this point, even Wei Qian himself began to reflect—since joining the Li family, had he been too focused on advancing his cultivation?  

The result was that after all this time in the Li household, he barely knew anyone.  

If not for the five-day break he had taken to break through to the second level of Qi Refining—during which he had met Li Guchen—he wouldn’t even have anyone to turn to now.  

"Then again, if I hadn’t met Li Guchen, I might not have been sent on this mission in the first place."  

Without Li Guchen, his performance wouldn’t have caught the attention of Elder Li Wanqing.  

"Fortune and misfortune are intertwined," Wei Qian could only console himself with this saying.  

This time, Li Guchen introduced Wei Qian to a middleman—not a member of the Li family, but a cultivator from a rogue clan.  

At the foot of Misty Ridge Mountain, as Wei Qian and Li Guchen descended, a round figure rushed toward them like a gust of wind.  

"Brother Li! Long time no see!" a cheerful voice called out.  

Li Guchen pushed the figure away with a laugh. "Stop clinging, you fatso! I called you here for business today."  

At the mention of business, the figure immediately stopped, revealing himself to be a plump, round-faced man.  

"My name is Bai Fugui, but you can just call me Fatty Bai," the man said with a grin. "You must be Brother Wei?"  

Wei Qian nodded. "That’s me. I’m looking to buy some talismans. Guchen said you have connections."  

"Absolutely!" Bai Fugui slapped his chest with a loud *thump*. "Fireblast Talismans, Water Shield Talismans, Earth Spike Talismans, Wind Blade Talismans, Minor Frost Talismans—I’ve got every first-grade talisman you could want."  

"Not only are they cheap, but the quality is also top-notch."  

Wei Qian glanced at Li Guchen, who nodded in confirmation. "This fatty loves to boast, but he’s not entirely full of hot air."  

"He knows a rogue talisman master who’s quite skilled. If you want talismans, he’s the one to go to."  

To further prove his credibility, Bai Fugui pulled out a few talismans from his storage pouch and handed them to Wei Qian for inspection.  

The smooth, uninterrupted runes and stable spiritual energy fluctuations confirmed that the talismans were indeed of good quality.  

If the price matched what Li Guchen had said, they would truly be a bargain.  

"First-grade low-tier talismans—two for one spirit stone. First-grade mid-tier—one for two spirit stones. First-grade high-tier—one for five spirit stones!" Bai Fugui cheerfully listed the prices.  

After some quick calculations, Wei Qian said, "I’ll take six first-grade low-tier Fireblast Talismans, two first-grade mid-tier Wind Blade Talismans, and two first-grade high-tier Water Shield Talismans."  

Bai Fugui’s mind worked fast—the moment Wei Qian finished speaking, he had the total ready. "That’ll be seventeen spirit stones."  

"Do you have any recovery or detoxification pills for sale?" Wei Qian asked.  

"Qi-Restoring Pills—twelve per bottle. Detoxification Pills—also twelve per bottle. Three spirit stones per bottle," Bai Fugui replied.  

"One of each!"  

Wei Qian swept his hand over his storage pouch, and twenty-three spirit stones appeared before him. With this, he had spent every last spirit stone he owned.  

Bai Fugui took thirteen of them. "The two first-grade high-tier Water Shield Talismans will take some time, but the rest can be traded now."  

In the next moment, Bai Fugui handed over ten talismans and two bottles of pills.  

Wei Qian accepted them and paused—there were two extra first-grade low-tier Swift Steps Talismans. What was this about?  

"First-time customer discount!" Bai Fugui grinned, his chubby face resembling a laughing Buddha. "Just remember me for future business."  

Wei Qian stored the talismans and pills in his pouch and nodded. "Next time I need something, I’ll come to you."
