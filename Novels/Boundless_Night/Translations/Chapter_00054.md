# Chapter 54: Secrets and the True Name

Qin Ming entered the dense forest beside the road, dug a deep pit with his mutton-fat jade iron knife, and buried the palm-sized cloth fragment.

"Afraid of causing trouble?" Old Man Liu asked.

Qin Ming nodded, throwing the wild rabbit he had hunted into the pit as well.

The young man transformed from black mist was sinister and extremely cold, giving him a very bad feeling. He felt it was prudent to be cautious when dealing with the only item the man carried.

The two of them had a steaming hot breakfast in Silvervine Town, then wandered the streets for another half-hour before heading towards the agreed-upon household.

The Wu family residence was not small, but it showed clear signs of decay. The red paint on the main gate had peeled off, and the bronze knockers had lost their luster.

"Old Wu, open the door!" Old Man Liu banged on the door knocker.

"Coming," an old man appeared and invited them inside.

The courtyard was large, but it no longer had its former grandeur. Some of the bluestones paving the path were cracked, and a large flower garden had long been converted into a vegetable patch. Dried gourd vines climbed over the rockery.

If not for their current state, they probably wouldn't have agreed to show their ancestral secret tome to outsiders.

Old Wu had only undergone rebirth once, and long ago lost any pretense of being from a prominent family, looking much like an ordinary old man.

The Wu family had no servants; a young boy from the household served them coarse tea.

"Old Wu, let's not beat around the bush. You know why we're here. Name your price," Old Man Liu went straight to the point, not wanting to waste time.

"To be honest, my feelings are complicated. My Wu family was so glorious back then; four generations ago, there was even a grand master who underwent five rebirths, looking down upon this entire region, not to mention our even earlier ancestors. Now, this is like... a son selling his grandfather's land, isn't it? Ah, the more I think about it, the more guilty I feel," Old Wu sighed.

He glanced at the spacious living room, which once boasted carved beams and painted pillars. Now, the table corners were broken, and the gold and silver threads inlaid in the thick pillars were gone.

Old Man Liu took a sip of tea and said, "Old Wu, you should be more open-minded. Which surname hasn't had its moments of glory? My Liu family, if traced back, was once royalty. Have I, a dragon's descendant, ever boasted about that?"

Old Wu said, "That's ancient history, and besides, are we even the same 'Liu'? Ah, I haven't been able to sleep soundly these past few days."

"Elder Wu, we're just borrowing it to read, and we guarantee not to leak it," Qin Ming said directly, pulling out five day-gold coins and placing them on the damaged tabletop.

This was already quite sincere, as in this remote area, one day-gold coin could provide a family of three with food and clothing for a year.

"Not enough," Old Wu shook his head.

Old Man Liu said, "Old Wu, don't be excessive. We're only borrowing it here for one day, and we've guaranteed not to spread it. Do you really think this is a divine book?"

Old Wu sighed, "When I was young, I went up to the Bright Moon Tower in Scarlet Mist City and spent two day-gold coins in a single night."

Old Man Liu immediately chuckled, saying, "Still bringing up the past? Be careful your old lady hears you!"

Qin Ming finally understood why the Wu family had declined so quickly. Old Wu seemed to have been quite extravagant and free-spending in his youth.

He said nothing, and placed two more day-gold coins on the table.

Old Man Liu sighed, "Old Wu, Little Qin and I have been risking life and limb recently, killing some mutated creatures and picking up some broken weapons from the Great Rift. After selling them, all our possessions are right here. Don't exploit us too harshly."

Old Wu remained silent, calmly sitting there and drinking tea.

It wasn't until Qin Ming increased the day-gold coins to fifteen that Old Wu sighed, "An unfilial descendant, burdened by life, has no choice but to show the secret tome to outsiders."

He took out an ancient-looking beast hide book from his chest, placed it on the table, and then walked out with a look of regret and decay.

Qin Ming held the beast hide book, his expression incredibly focused, his mind immersed in it. This was a sensitive and special stage, and he wanted to improve his strength as quickly as possible.

Old Wu hadn't tricked them; this ancestral secret tome was the crystallization of the Wu family ancestors' painstaking efforts, carrying a strong emotional resonance.

Qin Ming studied it carefully. The sections on the Rebirth Method couldn't compare to the silk scroll; they only offered some reference value.

Much later, he handed the beast hide book to Old Man Liu, then closed his eyes to digest what he had learned.

Old Man Liu didn't stand on ceremony either. After taking it, he carefully read it page by page, comparing and verifying it with what he had learned from the old mountain ranger.

Suddenly, he sensed something, looked up at Qin Ming opposite him, and was immediately unsettled.

Qin Ming sat there with his eyes closed, faint wisps of Skyglow appearing at his fingertips, sharp and fully revealed.

Old Man Liu considered himself a quick learner with exceptional talent, but now he was almost caught off guard. What did he see? Qin Ming had only just started, and he had already cultivated the Skyglow Force described in the book.

"You can take your time reading it here, elder. We've paid for it, after all. I'll go home to comprehend it," Qin Ming stood up.

Old Man Liu was completely stunned. People really couldn't be compared. He had almost apprenticed in Scarlet Mist City back then, but now his talent seemed insufficient?

"Young man, are you heading back already?" Old Wu in the courtyard was surprised, not expecting Qin Ming to come out so quickly and bid him farewell.

Qin Ming nodded, saying, "Yes, the content of this book is obscure, and its methods don't suit me."

Old Wu's downcast expression finally brightened considerably, and he smiled. He walked over, patted Qin Ming's shoulder, and said, "That's normal. The secret tome left by my ancestors is incredibly profound. Let alone you, who've only read it for such a short time, I've studied it for half my life and still haven't fully grasped it."

"Indeed, an extraordinary book!" Qin Ming nodded and walked out of the Wu family's main gate.

"Clatter!"

A sound came from the living room. Old Wu quickly strode in and found Old Man Liu somewhat flustered, having accidentally knocked a teacup to the floor.

When Qin Ming returned, he happened to see Yang Yongqing, who lived at the village entrance, gently patting the tall black goat and whispering, "Eternal Black, in four more days, we'll be going to Golden Rooster Ridge..."

Qin Ming returned to his small courtyard and began practicing the brand new Skyglow Force.

The "Spike Force," as recorded in the beast hide book, once mastered, allowed one to easily break armor with bare hands, being irresistible. It was a Skyglow Force with extremely strong penetrating power.

Undoubtedly, it had significant overlap with the "Nail Force." It was estimated that practicing both simultaneously could complement each other and be efficiently merged.

The Wu family ancestors were known as "Twin Masters of Spear and Arrow" in this region, skilled in archery and wielding a great spear. Both were cultivated based on Spike Force. When Skyglow Force could be externally released, the arrows he shot and the spear thrusts he made were terrifying.

Furthermore, related records and certain empirical insights in the beast hide book broadened Qin Ming's knowledge, such as the mention of the efficacy of the three-colored flower.

According to the book, the three-colored flowers produced in Spirit Mountain were of superior grade, with gentle medicinal properties, capable of nourishing and strengthening the Skyglow within the human body, thereby enhancing Skyglow Force.

Ultimately, the root of everything was Skyglow. The Skyglow born within the human body was normally peaceful and gentle, capable of nourishing oneself. But once released externally, by exerting force in different ways, its violent side would be drawn out.

The beast hide book warned that when merging various Skyglow Forces, one must be extremely cautious and careful. If they were not compatible, it could trigger a massive explosion of Skyglow within the body, leading to a very tragic end.

Spike Force was also a Skyglow Force formed by merging three ordinary force methods. If there were too many, the Wu family ancestors dared not attempt it.

Qin Ming was thoughtful. He hadn't encountered such a problem; he felt his Skyglow Force had extremely strong inclusiveness.

The book mentioned that three-colored flowers nurtured in places where Skyglow penetrated the night curtain were of supreme grade, much more precious than even the superior grade from Spirit Mountain.

However, because these three-colored flowers contained external Skyglow, their medicinal properties were too potent and highly corrosive. The human body could not withstand them unless supplemented by objects rich in vitality, consumed together, to ensure safety.

Of course, a very small number of exceptionally gifted individuals were excluded; they might be fearless of the corrosive effects of the supreme-grade three-colored flowers' potent medicinal properties.

Qin Ming guessed that the so-called corrosion should be related to the spiritual essence of the Skyglow that penetrated the night curtain and remained within the three-colored flowers.

Back in the underground cave, Huang Jingde had been smiling and seemingly answered every question, yet he hadn't mentioned these things. Ultimately, he habitually concealed a part of the truth.

Qin Ming pondered that since his body could resist the corrosion of Skyglow without dying, he should be able to withstand the medicinal properties of the supreme-grade three-colored flower without needing to find objects rich in vitality.

***

In the mountains, near the Great Rift, two bandit leaders from Golden Rooster Ridge personally guarded the area with their men.

"He's not going to target the young adults again, is he? We've reminded him several times; continuous deaths will cause trouble. If it attracts the attention of Scarlet Mist City's higher-ups, it will be a big problem."

"Is he really an Outsider? He's sinister and eerily cold, nothing like those who resemble gods or immortals."

"He doesn't actively manifest, so neither of us can see him. This must be an Outsider's method, but judging by his techniques, he probably isn't on a righteous path."

The two bandit leaders discussed in secret, unaware that the young man transformed from black mist had already died.

Earlier, that young man had come holding a token given by the Golden Thief. He had asked the Golden Rooster Ridge bandit leaders to help guard this place and prevent anyone from approaching.

"This person already guaranteed he would only target older people, making it look like natural deaths so as not to cause trouble. But the dead of night is long over, why hasn't he returned?"

"Let's wait and see."

"Back then, an old beast in the mountains cried by a grave. With each bow, an anomaly occurred, and it rapidly mutated, continuously advancing, causing a huge stir. Afterwards, Scarlet Mist City's higher-ups sealed off any follow-up news about the incident. Now this Outsider has come back to the same place to stir up trouble. Do you think he's trying to imitate that old beast? If that were the case, and the matter leaked, a hundred deaths wouldn't be enough for us."

"He's an Outsider, surely he wouldn't follow that aberrant path, would he?"

The two bandit leaders had serious expressions; they really didn't want to deal with that eerie young man.

"Could it be that some powerful Outsider wants to use him to probe Black-White Mountain?"

"Unlikely. I think he's about to leave. He looks like he's in a hurry, probably just passing through and doing a few things along the way."

Qin Ming sat in meditation. He had cultivated the "Coiling Silk Force," "Intercepting Force," "Nail Force," and "Spike Force." Adding his own unique Skyglow Force, he felt he could now consume the three-colored flower and then completely merge all of them. His strength would undoubtedly see a significant increase!

"This scene feels familiar..." He stared at the three-colored flower in the jade box, somewhat lost in thought.

The layered, willow-leaf-like, yet also sword-like, three-colored petals emitted a large amount of colorful mist, with spiritual light flowing and enveloping him.

Since his third rebirth, Qin Ming not only recalled some events from his childhood, but also began to experience other vague and fragmented memories surfacing in his mind.

"Discard." He murmured, uttering this single character, and dipping his finger in tea, wrote it on the table.

At this moment, as he looked at the three-colored flower, it was as if he was seeing a similar scene from the past.

"Cui Chonghe." Next, he wrote these three characters on the tabletop, gazing at them intently, and murmured, "'Chong Qi Yi Wei He' (harmonizing through the merging of energies), it comes from scattered texts of the Outsiders. Cui as a surname, Cui Chonghe... is this my real name? But I deeply resent Outsiders now."
