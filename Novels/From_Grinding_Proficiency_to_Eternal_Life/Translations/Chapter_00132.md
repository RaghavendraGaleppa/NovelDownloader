# Chapter 132: Blood Sacrifice

An ancient bell seemed to toll within Xu Yunfan's mind. The divine consciousness within his thoughts suddenly stepped forth from the churning, wave-like mist, pressing everything flat.

The surging killing intent and anxiety receded like the ebbing tide. The tremor of every muscle fiber throughout his body became clearly discernible.

The tip of the spear reflected in Xu Yunfan's pupils suddenly slowed by half a beat. He twisted his waist and leaned back, his movement almost synchronized with the spear shadow. As the tip of his nose grazed the blade, he could even count the fine cloud patterns on the edge, and the frequency at which the spear light—which could easily tear his body apart—pulsed at the tip.

*Swish!*

The spear light plowed a deep furrow into the ground, spraying sparks, and shot straight out for five zhang.

"Hmph?!"

This high-ranking member of the Incense Fire Sect never imagined that his spear strike would miss.

The opponent was merely a Three-Training Martial Master, while he was at the Blood Transformation Realm, yet his spear strike missed!

Xu Yunfan used the momentum to flip backward. His toes hooked up half of an iron chain and flung it toward the eyes of the Flood Dragon Horse.

In the sound of the chain links breaking the air, his body arched back like a shrimp. His back crashed through the last remaining window lattice of the Emerald Wave Tower behind him. The moment he landed, he had already transformed into an arrow leaving the string, shooting toward the direction of Emerald Wave Lake.

The man intended to pursue with his spear, but just as he squeezed the horse's belly with his legs, a thunderous explosion suddenly came from the direction of the General's Mansion in the city.

"You little bastards from the Incense Fire Sect, you're looking for death!"

Following that was a deafening sound of metal colliding that almost shook the entire city.

Looking at Xu Yunfan, who was about to disappear from sight, the man felt truly displeased.

There was a secret on that opponent, perhaps an unexpected surprise.

That was merely the Martial Master Realm. Even if his muscles and skin had reached the second level of training to perfection, as a Blood Transformation Realm expert, he shouldn't have missed a single spear strike.

He hesitated for a moment, ultimately afraid of delaying major affairs. If he were to be held accountable afterward, it would be difficult to end well.

The man snorted coldly and had no choice but to stop, preparing to go support the others.

"Pursue."

The voice of the Blood Transformation Realm expert was muffled inside his helmet as he looked at the deputy general beside him who had been silent all along.

The deputy general received the order and led three hundred heavily armored sect members, their iron boots trampling the ground as they advanced in formation. However, they saw Xu Yunfan suddenly turn around and throw the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. With a flick of his wrist, the chain hammer slammed into the paved road of bluestone, blasting up a smoke cloud of a zhang high. By the time the smoke curtain dissipated, only ripples spreading in circles remained on the lake surface.

The night mist of Emerald Wave Lake was torn open by the rapidly moving figure.

Every step Xu Yunfan took on the water exploded with a bowl-sized splash. Supported by the Lin Character Formula, he could clearly perceive the subtle touch between the Yongquan acupoint on the sole of his foot and the water surface. Each contact lasted no more than three-tenths of a second, just like a dragonfly skimming the water.

The writhing muscle strength throughout his body transmitted to the soles of his feet. With every step he took on the water surface, it felt as if he were stepping on solid ground.

Xu Yunfan dared not stay in the Lin State for too long. Although he had reached the Three-Training Perfection, and with the assistance of the attribute panel, his body had perfectly transformed beyond the mortal realm, greatly extending the time he could maintain the Lin State, using it for too long would still leave him exhausted and unable to continue.

"Xu Yunfan!"

Yan Yuwei's furious roar came from the south bank.

This madwoman who had charged into the Incense Fire Sect was covered in blood. She actually dragged her large sword and chased into the lake. Her legs, driven by the Molten Gold Forging Iron Technique, churned the water like propellers, keeping most of her body afloat on the water surface. However, with every step she took, blood was bursting from her body.

Xu Yunfan cursed inwardly. With a flick of his hand, he threw the chain hammer to wrap around her ankle, then pulled his arm, dragging her up.

As he used the momentum to fly across the water, he saw the black smoke rising from the northern city wall had already gathered into a black cloud over Emerald Wave City.

Half a day later, amidst the reeds in the center of the lake, Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on a cracked reef.

Xu Yunfan, sitting cross-legged, had his muscles and tendons constantly twitching. His bare upper body was steaming with white mist. As his blood energy surfaced on his skin surface, thirteen blood python patterns moved mysteriously across his muscle surface, constantly sorting out the hidden injuries within his body.

He was sorting out the chaotic blood energy within his body.

After reaching the Three-Training Perfection, his blood energy was condensed and solid, different from ordinary martial artists. It was truly guided by his will, shuttling between his muscles and tendons to soothe his bones and muscles.

Three zhang away in the shallows, Yan Yuwei lay on her side, looking towards Emerald Wave City. The wounds on her body that had split open had already been treated with the special golden sore ointment he carried. The ointment mixed with blood had formed a brown scab on the wounds, meaning she had passed the critical stage.

He looked towards the north bank. The entire Emerald Wave City had turned into a blood color. The Incense Fire Sect's scarlet great banner fluttered noisily on the city wall.

What was even more terrifying were the human candles suspended at the city gate.

Over a hundred corpses were pierced through the collarbones by iron hooks. Their abdominal cavities were hollowed out and filled with lamp oil. After being lit, they swayed like ghost fires in the twilight.

Lying on the ground, Yan Yuwei turned her head to look at Emerald Wave City, her eyes unblinking, staring fixedly at a certain spot in the city. Her knuckles dug deep into the reef as she stared死死盯着城中某处火光.

Xu Yunfan glanced over and understood in his heart.

This Yan Yuwei should be from Emerald Wave City.

After a long while, he finally asked: "The Cloud Piercing Arrow I stuffed into your hand earlier?"

"Threw it away." Yan Yuwei's voice sounded like charcoal ashes scraped from a blacksmith's furnace, carrying a dull nasal tone.

"It was in the way."

"..."

The veins on Xu Yunfan's temple throbbed.

When he stood up, the joints throughout his body cracked like frying beans. The magma-like patterns on the handle of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer flickered on and off.

"According to what you said, the External Affairs Hall manages many of the Heavenly Work Cave's external industries. If they have truly betrayed us, then by now, the Heavenly Work Cave's Mechanism City恐怕 is..."

He glanced at the lying Yan Yuwei, pondered for a moment, and continued.

"Let's return to Heavenly Work City first. If the Heavenly Work Cave is still in the dark and news doesn't reach them in time, once the Incense Fire Sect's army reaches the city walls, the Heavenly Work Cave will be in grave danger."

"Let's go!"

Yan Yuwei suddenly shot up, taking the lead to step onto the water surface. Her legs driven by the Molten Gold Forging Iron Technique walked on water as if on level ground, the splashes she kicked up containing some fine fish corpses.

Xu Yunfan watched her near self-destructive way of running, knowing this woman was using physical pain to numb her grief.

Ten li south of Emerald Wave City, the area both inside and outside the city was already littered with corpses. The stench of decay was so thick it choked the nose. From time to time, the Incense Fire Sect's 'Heavenly Army of Exorcism' patrolled about. In just half a day, who knew what the Incense Fire Sect had done, but the smell of decaying corpses grew even stronger.

Xu Yunfan crouched on a sour jujube tree, watching the Incense Fire Sect members at the bottom of the valley arranging the corpses into the shape of a lotus platform.

Eight black-robed men were using iron brushes to scrape the fascia off the bones. The scraped meat paste was put into earthenware jars, on which were clearly inscribed the three characters 'Elixir of Longevity'.

"Ming Lord is merciful, bestowing upon you eternal life..."

The leading old priest slashed his palm open with a howl. As his blood dripped into the earthenware jar, green smoke rose.

More than seventy sect members knelt on the ground chanting scriptures, their tones twisted like night owls: "The skull becomes a bright lamp illuminating the great thousand, the intestines turn into iron chains to bind the heavens..."

Several young children who were huddled nearby suddenly walked into the center of the field. Under the somewhat greedy gazes of the group of sect members, they wore pure, innocent smiles that sent shivers down one's spine, singing and dancing.

"The baby is good, the baby is cute,

Skin peeled off to make a lampshade;

Father smiles, mother dances,

Bones pulled out to build a bridge.

Brother's liver, sister's gall,

Boil a fragrant soup to offer the Ming Lord;

Neighbors and relatives, don't run away,

Early arrival at the Pure Land is true filial piety."

As the innocent and terrifyingly chilling lyrics of the nursery rhyme sounded, several black-robed sect members surrounding the children took out sharp knives and began to cut open their abdomens.
