# Chapter 246: The Grandmasters' War Concludes (Two Chapters in One)

Outside the vast plateau, the long night remained, enveloped in dark mist. However, a shocking change was occurring; thick beams of light appeared one after another, tearing through the pitch-black sky. In the sky, it was as if numerous meteorites had pierced the night curtain, detonating the heavy clouds across the heavens!

People were horrified, their bodies frozen. This was because the outer regions of the plateau also became as bright as day. All of this was due to a bloody sun exploding deep within the plateau, its fragments scattering in all directions. Cao Qianqiu burst apart, like the disintegration of a sun. Not only was the entire plateau blindingly bright, but even the outer areas became illuminated. His Pure Yang spiritual consciousness fragments, comparable to real meteorites, streaked across the sky with long tails of light, even scattering the clouds on the horizon. At this moment, the night sky was clear. This was the sight of a Dao of Immortality Grandmaster-level expert after being blasted apart; each fragment of their spiritual consciousness plunged into the night like a comet, a truly magnificent and terrifying spectacle.

Cao Qianqiu was in immense pain. His main consciousness being shattered caused him to experience the agony of being torn to pieces. How could so-called Pure Yang immortality come without a price? Moreover, he was attacked by five Grandmasters simultaneously, resulting in the permanent loss of some spiritual consciousness fragments, a devastating blow. He roared, his main consciousness reappearing, rapidly coalescing his Pure Yang spiritual light. If his Pure Yang fragments did not re-merge, he would be in even greater danger. The five Grandmasters of the Path of Rebirth, battle-hardened and incredibly experienced, immediately intercepted those spiritual consciousness fragments, intending to annihilate them separately.

Outside the vast plateau, at the edge of the dark sky, all clouds and mist burst open, and beams of light flew back towards their origin. Cao Qianqiu reappeared, his Pure Yang consciousness reassembling his body. At this moment, Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan were going all out to help him block the Grandmasters of the Path of Rebirth.

"Fairy Yu, you must do your best now. If something happens to Old Cao, the problem will be extremely serious," Sun Taichu transmitted mentally. Abandoning his usual calm demeanor, he now stomped on immortal dao runes, unleashing beams of light that pierced through heaven and earth, fighting with all his might.

Zhao Wenhan spoke, "Sirs, let's stop. There's no benefit to continuing this fight; it's a severe internal drain."

Sun Taichu nodded, saying, "If there are grudges, wouldn't it be better to settle them during the Great Frontier Expansion, see who has superior methods against external enemies, decide a victor, and let the loser accept punishment?"

Lu Yu retorted, "You speak very eloquently, but when Cao Qianqiu blocked the Path of Rebirth and stifled heaven-defying talents, why didn't you step forward and say these words?"

Qingtian stood tall in the sky, heavenly light surging like a burning ocean, declaring, "This bastard Cao Qianqiu, either kill him or cripple him. How can we let him continue to cause trouble?" As he spoke, he had already arrived, his power capable of propping up the heavens, his style fierce. He cleaved down with a great axe. The Tathagata of This Era said nothing, but a massive hand swept forth, directly reasoning through action!

Cao Qianqiu's face was grim. The Grandmasters of the Path of Rebirth were "barbaric" one after another, demanding his death one moment and his crippling the next. Did they really think he could be easily manipulated? At this moment, his body emitted dazzling light, clanging loudly. Immortal dao runes densely covered him, forming nine-colored armor. Simultaneously, a nine-colored spear appeared in his right hand, and a light shield in his left. Both flowed with a multitude of golden symbols, constructed from Pure Yang energy. Armored and gripping his spear, he counter-attacked with full force!

However, several Grandmasters chose to directly withstand Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan's attacks just to target him. In an instant, his nine-colored armor shattered. Qingtian's several axe strikes caused his shield to crack and then explode. The Tathagata of This Era's massive hand continuously struck, and Cao Qianqiu's nine-colored armor quickly disintegrated. Jiang Zhiyuan, the Sect Master of the Yin-Yang Monastery, punched Old Cao's back, causing his chest to instantly bulge and swell, revealing a huge fist print.

*Crack!* Cao Qianqiu's nine-colored spear snapped into two under Qingtian's massive axe. With a *thud*, the massive axe continued its momentum, cleaving into his chest. As it met the protruding fist print, axe light and black-and-white light simultaneously erupted there. Cao Qianqiu groaned. His entire chest was pierced, bursting open, Pure Yang blood splattering everywhere. Simultaneously, the Tathagata of This Era's massive hand struck, covering him in cracks, and he constantly coughed up blood. The Yuqing Grandmaster appeared, swinging down his pristine Heaven-Measuring Ruler. Half of Cao Qianqiu's body shattered, his left shoulder exploded, and his arm instantly detached. The Six Emperors of Heaven descended, either smashing down with imperial seals, sacrificing jade tablets, or directly striking with fists and kicks, all impacting Old Cao's body. In an instant, Cao Qianqiu exploded on the spot once again.

In such a short time, he had disintegrated repeatedly, suffering severe losses to his spiritual consciousness. Cao Qianqiu had already lost 20% of his Pure Yang origin! So-called immortal characteristics naturally had their limits. How could he not suffer attrition by constantly exploding? Each time he burst apart, a portion of his Pure Yang consciousness was severed. Cao Qianqiu was horrified. If this continued, he would truly be crippled. Now, his hair disheveled, his spiritual consciousness burning, and a blood-red sun covering his body, he was fighting desperately. It wasn't just him fighting desperately; Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan had also long since used their ultimate trump cards to help Cao Qianqiu preserve his life.

Outside the plateau, many people went from shock to numbness, all somewhat dazed. The once invincible Cao Qianqiu was actually blasted apart multiple times, exploding there. This was simply unimaginable in the past. On the Path of Rebirth, whether it was the older generation or young disciples, morale soared. They felt immensely satisfied, as if they had vented their long-held anger. In the past, Cao Qianqiu was like a lingering shadow in their hearts, unshakable. Now, he had crumbled.

"Fairy Yu, you must deploy your sect's ultimate methods. If Old Cao dies, our two paths will be unable to resolve this peacefully!" Sun Taichu said solemnly via mental transmission. Although Cao Qianqiu was not well-liked, he was the sharpest blade of the Dao of Immortality. In the past, he had done much of the dirty work. Today, he absolutely could not die. Otherwise, the Dao of Immortality would lose face, and if their own faction did not save him, what cohesion would they have left? If Cao Qianqiu died, the Dao of Immortality would need to retaliate commensurately. In that case, it would mean a fight to the death with the Path of Rebirth. A bloody war between the two paths, a struggle for the Dao, would become increasingly dangerous. It was unknown how many Grandmaster-level figures would perish. Once that happened, the Esoteric Sect would probably go mad with laughter. At the same time, this was not good news for the expansion deep into the Night Mist World, as it meant a depletion of humanity's top-tier combat power. Therefore, Sun Taichu, Zhao Wenhan, and others wanted to protect him with all their might, ensuring Cao Qianqiu did not die here. Only then would it be beneficial for the Path of Rebirth, the Dao of Immortality, and the Esoteric Path. Everyone would be fine, and no path would need to engage in a bloody struggle.

The five Grandmasters of the Path of Rebirth fought against the four Grandmasters of the Dao of Immortality! Cao Qianqiu had suffered continuous heavy blows and was no longer in his peak state. Now, being continuously bombarded by the Tathagata's massive hand, he was cracking from head to toe, on the verge of collapsing again. Sun Taichu, Zhao Wenhan, and Yu Shaohua were all startled, because each attack from the five Grandmasters of the Path of Rebirth was a desperate one. When these five attacked the three of them, they spared no expense, clashing head-on every time, unafraid of harming their origins. Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan frowned. Were these people crazy? Weren't these five old, decaying, and barely able to sustain a few battles? How dared they act like this!

Lu Yu, even while enduring Sun Taichu's attacks, still used his Six Emperors avatar to tear Cao Qianqiu apart, infuriating him to no end. Cao Qianqiu's heart turned cold; 30% of his Pure Yang consciousness had been permanently destroyed! "Little Cao brat, go ahead and be arrogant again! When you were kicking down other people's dojos and slaughtering their talented juniors, did you ever think of today?" Qingtian Grandmaster said, his right hand blocking Zhao Wenhan with his great axe, while his left hand savagely slapped Cao Qianqiu. At the same time, Yuqing Grandmaster blocked Yu Shaohua, Lu Yu intercepted Sun Taichu, and Jiang Zhiyuan and the Tathagata of This Era jointly attacked Cao Qianqiu. Old Cao was sliced into two by black-and-white light, and then shattered into Pure Yang blood rain by the Tathagata Seal!

Cao Qianqiu's mind and spirit trembled. When he re-coalesced, he found that only 60% of his Pure Yang consciousness remained. If this continued, he would truly be completely crippled. If others knew that 40% of his cultivation had dissipated like this, what good days would he have in the future? He had made many enemies in his life, and those who were still alive were all tough opponents. If he were to become weak, the consequences would be unimaginable, unless he never stepped out of the pure land beyond the mundane again. He was Cao Bubai (Cao the Undefeated), and such a dismal end, going into seclusion, was not his style.

At this moment, he thought of a method he had once jokingly discussed, but never had the chance to practice. Had he truly fallen to such a desperate state now? Was he going to walk the path of 'breaking before establishing' with his disciple Li Qingxu? When he thought of this, he became incomparably agitated. That was the helpless choice of a cripple; for him, it was an utter disgrace! He was Cao Qianqiu, was he truly going to fall to that extent? Not to mention the various difficulties blocking his path, even if he could achieve something, he would have to remain in seclusion for many years. In the early stages of that state, he wouldn't even dare to show himself. For the once arrogant Cao Qianqiu, thinking of the cold words and various taunts from the world was truly more unbearable than death.

With a loud *boom*, Pure Yang blood rain flew everywhere as he exploded once more. He tragically realized that even attempting the path of 'breaking before establishing' would be difficult; he first needed to survive. Cao Qianqiu grew fierce. He hated Qingtian the most and once had an impulse to drag that foul-mouthed old bastard with him to the grave. However, his repeated charges were thwarted by cruel reality. Besides taking a few more slaps, he hadn't harmed the other party at all. Now, with only 60% of his Pure Yang origin consciousness remaining, he couldn't defeat any of the Path of Rebirth Grandmasters.

"Little Cao brat, you're stronger than your master! You took nine of my slaps directly, your skin is truly thick!" Qingtian laughed heartily. This was absolute, blatant humiliation. This burly man had once beaten Cao Qianqiu's master, and now he was targeting Cao Qianqiu himself, igniting a raging inferno of frustration within Old Cao. It was truly unbearable. Cao Qianqiu's eyes were chillingly cold. Qingtian's words had provoked him. His entire life, he had been striking others down, watching other experts struggle helplessly. He never imagined that today he would be repeatedly severely injured and ridiculed in such a manner. He was finally experiencing the feelings of his past opponents.

It wasn't that Sun Taichu, Zhao Wenhan, and the others weren't trying to rescue him, but rather because the Path of Rebirth Grandmasters were fighting with suicidal determination. Even these two were fighting with trepidation. This was because even blood was at the corners of their mouths. Similarly, some Grandmasters on the Path of Rebirth were injured, but they didn't care at all, seemingly unconcerned by such injuries. Instead, their fighting spirit became even stronger, their eyes gleaming, as if they yearned to bathe in blood and sustain even heavier wounds. What was the reason for this? Sun Taichu, Zhao Wenhan, and the others were completely bewildered. Those few were already extremely old and infirm. How could they act as wildly as young people, unafraid of exhausting their lifespan?

At this moment, the four Grandmasters of the Dao of Immortality, including Cao Qianqiu, were all greatly shaken. Could it be that the Grandmasters of the Path of Rebirth had found a method to prolong their lives? Or had new Grandmasters already appeared on this path, surpassing their predecessors and resolving the Path of Rebirth's predicament of lacking successors? No longer was the generational gap a problem. Or perhaps these old fellows had advanced further, charting a new path once again? Was the current bloody struggle preparing them for rebirth?!

"Little Cao brat, weren't you arrogant enough to demand that we bow down and become porters for the Dao of Immortality Grandmasters? With such meager skill, what big shot are you pretending to be?!" The down-to-earth Grandmaster Qingtian perfectly fulfilled his role as a mouthpiece, constantly hacking at Cao Qianqiu with his massive axe. Old Cao was arrogant, but usually absolutely calm in battle. Now, however, he was almost choked to death by him, truly furious. This old fellow kept stabbing at his core. He manifested a Soul-Stabilizing Bell from his Pure Yang spiritual consciousness, countless runes blossoming. He sealed Qingtian within the bell, recklessly burning and refining his soul. However, with a *clang*, the great bell shattered, cleaved apart by Qingtian's massive axe. He burst directly out, simultaneously delivering a 'great axe splitting the skull' strike to Cao Qianqiu.

"You're more suited to be my child attendant!" Qingtian declared. This time, Cao Qianqiu was also simultaneously bombarded by the Yin-Yang Diagram, the Tathagata's Finger, and Yuqing Light. The special heavenly light force fields of the three Grandmasters twisted space and time. Old Cao burst apart again. He was horrified to discover that only 50% of his Pure Yang spiritual consciousness remained. This had already crossed the red line! Even with rare treasures, he was in grave danger.

"Old Sun, Wenhan, Fairy Yu, help me block them!" Cao Qianqiu was actually furious long ago, extremely dissatisfied with the three, but unable to vent his anger because he was still relying on them for now. In fact, Old Cao had already lost the power to fight. In his current state, he would explode on the spot no matter which Grandmaster he faced; he was extremely "fragile"! It wasn't that Cao Qianqiu wasn't strong enough. In fact, his ability to persevere until now fully proved his terrifying power. The five Grandmasters had primarily come out just to deal with him; he had reason to be proud.

"Are you trying to say there's no one left in my Dao of Immortality?!" At this moment, a low shout came from the distant sky, accompanied by two dazzling lights blossoming and streaking across the heavens, so fast they seemed to traverse space-time. In the blink of an eye, they traversed the vast world, entering the core battlefield from outside the plateau, arriving directly at the scene. Undoubtedly, two more Grandmasters from the Dao of Immortality had arrived. This meant a total of six Grandmasters from the Dao of Immortality were present, one more than the Path of Rebirth side. However, considering that Cao Qianqiu was half-crippled and no longer a significant threat, the strength of both sides was now similar, somewhat balanced.

Lu Yu said, "Who do we have here? Qian Jingxing of the Immortal Land, Wu Zhaoye of the Calamity Land. Did you not follow the old monster to the Fourth Abyssal Land to dig people out?"

"Sirs, the Path of Rebirth doesn't put us in their eyes. Today, we must fight to the death!" Cao Qianqiu transmitted mentally. He couldn't swallow this humiliation. In fact, these two newly arrived Grandmasters were indeed more hot-tempered. After all, relatively speaking, they were still "young" and in their prime for courageous advancement.

"Kill!" The two came up without saying much, immediately engaging in battle. Cao Qianqiu sadly realized that he had become a marginal figure, unable to join in, because the moment he charged, he almost split apart again. "Ah..." he groaned, in the past, no matter the occasion, he was always the absolute center of the stage. Was he now to withdraw from the historical stage?

Qingtian said, "You two brats are birds of a feather with Cao Qianqiu. Go ahead and boast! Wanting to find a Grandmaster of the Path of Rebirth to be your porter? You're asking for a beating!" The battlefield was truly tumultuous. No one expected two more Grandmasters to arrive, instantly escalating the battle to white-hot intensity. This was because the latter two were radicals, wanting to fight first and talk later. However, Qian Jingxing of the Immortal Land and Wu Zhaoye of the Calamity Land were shocked to find that these old fellows were fighting like lunatics. Every clash with them was without reservation, completely unafraid of lifespan repercussions, incurring massive consumption each time. In fact, the old fellows became wilder the more they fought, their morale seemingly soaring, their fighting spirit overflowing.

In a short while, everyone had blood at the corners of their mouths; every Grandmaster on both sides was injured. "Are they crazy?" Qian Jingxing asked Sun Taichu mentally, perplexed. Sun Taichu's expression was grim. He transmitted, "I suspect that one of the Path of Rebirth Grandmasters has pioneered a new path, finding a way to advance again. They might be putting it into practice right now, and they need battles like this."

"Sirs, let's stop here!" Zhao Wenhan said. He didn't want to play into their hands and wished to understand their true condition.

"You say stop and we stop? Let's fight first, then talk!"

"Furthermore, Cao Qianqiu hasn't been crippled yet!" This was the response of the Path of Rebirth Grandmasters; they had no intention of stopping. Moreover, the few became even more desperate, dragging them into a bloody fight. This was clearly a life-and-death struggle, a posture of going to the Yellow Springs with their enemies.

"I... Hiss!" Qian Jingxing and Wu Zhaoye were both injured, and not lightly. They were now in a difficult position, like riding a tiger, unable to dismount.

*Pffft!* Suddenly, Qian Jingxing's head was struck by a blade light and shattered. Although he quickly recovered, his hair still stood on end. The Path of Rebirth actually had a sixth Grandmaster! This not only exceeded his expectations but also greatly astonished everyone else!

"This is the Heavenly Light Energy recorded in the 'Heaven-Severing Manual'. Didn't the Grandmasters of this lineage die long ago?!" Even Sun Taichu, who usually appeared the most gentle, had a moment of chilling expression. They all calmed down. If the two paths fought to the death, even if the Dao of Immortality had more experts, there would ultimately be a terrifying outcome where both sides perished. Someone would drag them all down. Three or four Grandmasters, perhaps there was still a chance to besiege them, but six? That would be terrifying. By this point, they were already inclined to stop and cease hostilities. It would be better to sit down and discuss some matters.

With a *bang*, Cao Qianqiu exploded once more!

***

In the outer reaches of the plateau, another person challenged Lu Zizai, and as expected, was defeated without suspense. Simultaneously, Qin Ming fought another battle, defeating another Immortal Seed. At this point, the grassland became completely quiet; no one dared to step forward to challenge them again. Many people's hearts were uneasy. Was the Path of Rebirth truly on the rise? All three generations—old, middle, and young—had shown extraordinary performances, achieving astonishing results.

Lu Zizai looked at the captive Pu Heng at his feet and said, "Why aren't you speaking? Is it because you don't want to?"

"My strength is far inferior to yours," Pu Heng honestly replied, abandoning his usual domineering style. His posture was practically screaming: "I'm obedient now, please spare me."

Lu Zizai said, "You are the chief disciple of a certain faction in the Dao of Immortality. Killing you like this would be too disrespectful to your Dao of Immortality." Instantly, Pu Heng felt a sense of relief in his heart, secretly letting out a long breath.

"Then cripple him," Lu Zizai said. And then he made his move, refining Pu Heng's Pure Yang spiritual consciousness fragments. It had to be said that Cao Qianqiu was indeed good to his disciples, giving them life-saving methods. However, Lu Zizai had prepared beforehand, locking Pu Heng down so he couldn't escape. Pu Heng shrieked miserably. His Pure Yang spiritual consciousness fragments were continuously severed and then persistently refined, until less than 10% remained.

"Go!" Lu Zizai waved a hand at him, breaking the chains of heavenly light that had manifested to lock him. Pu Heng knew that the other party had done this on purpose, sparing his life so he could experience the myriad forms of life's struggles that lay ahead. He had fallen from the clouds to the earth. Given his past domineering conduct, falling to this state was truly more unbearable than death. How would others view him? He dared not imagine if his past opponents were to target him. For a moment, Pu Heng was utterly disheartened.

"Senior Brother, it's alright. We'll walk the path of 'breaking before establishing'," Li Qingxu went to meet him. Pu Heng's mindset collapsed. He really wanted to shout: Do you actually believe there's such a 'broken' path?! However, he remembered what he had seen not long ago: his teacher also seemed half-crippled. Perhaps he and his master could support each other and try to walk this path. In truth, Pu Heng was very powerful. Many direct disciples of Grandmasters were no match for him. It was only because he met Lu Zizai today that he fell to this state; otherwise, he would never have ended up like this.

***

Deep within the plateau, the Grandmaster-level battle concluded. Those figures stood high in the sky, conversing via spiritual light streams. Cao Qianqiu was aggrieved, indignant, and agitated. His mood was at its absolute worst. How could they cease hostilities? In the end, he was the most severely injured, ending the battle half-crippled. He had lost over 50% of his Pure Yang origin spiritual consciousness, his cultivation halved. This was the greatest loss he had ever suffered in his life, yet he could not seek revenge.

Sun Taichu said, "Old Cao, don't be hasty. Let's think long-term. Someone on the Path of Rebirth might have pioneered a new path. We need to understand this clearly. This kind of battle might be fulfilling their goals."

"You're just cowards! Hurry up and go to the Fourth Abyssal Land, find the old monster, and join forces to wipe out the Path of Rebirth Grandmasters. What's wrong with that?!" Cao Qianqiu roared.

Sun Taichu's expression was grave. He responded secretly, "A long time ago, the Grandmasters of the Path of Rebirth were already debating: what is rebirth? How does one walk this path? They believed perhaps only by dying and then being reborn could they align with its true meaning. I suspect that some of these old fellows have taken that step. Now, they are trying to use us to stimulate their full potential, to achieve nirvana after reaching the brink of death."

Cao Qianqiu was almost driven mad with anger, saying, "I don't believe any of that. Dead is dead. Who can be reborn after death? Their path has severe flaws. You are just weak!"

***

Regardless, the Grandmaster-level battle had concluded. The giants of the two paths sat down to talk, naturally discussing all aspects, from the Path of Rebirth's right to speak to the distribution plan for the future Great Frontier Expansion, everything was mentioned.

Qingtian said, "If another scoundrel like Cao Qianqiu appears, we will certainly follow through to the end, annihilating all Immortal Seeds of the Dao of Immortality, including your direct disciples. At worst, we'll mutually sever each other's paths forward."
