# Chapter 133

Boom!

Zhou Changsheng didn't say a word, his eyes turning cold. His right hand shot out, forming a claw, resembling a true dragon. Though a physical body, it gleamed with metallic light, shattering the space wherever it passed.

The Saint Devil's body remained still. He slightly raised his right hand, fingers and palm forming a sword, as if a master of the sword path was unleashing the most brilliant strike of his life.

Clang!

Both were physical bodies, yet where they met, a crisp clang of metal on metal echoed.

After a single blow, Zhou Changsheng stopped moving and let out a cold snort. “Saint Devil, if you continue to spout nonsense, this matter will be dropped, and you will face my Zhou family's endless pursuit.”

“Those two friends of your grandson are natives of the God-Forsaken Land,” the Saint Devil said, glancing at Zhou Tian.

“I don't care what their identities are. Since they are my grandson's friends, I will protect their lives. Saint Devil, I advise you to be careful with your words and actions. Why do you insist on becoming a guest elder of my Zhou family?!” Zhou Changsheng's body blazed like a furnace, his aura scorching as he stared intently at the Saint Devil.

“Alright, alright,” the Saint Devil said helplessly. “I'm scared of your Zhou family, alright? I don't want to face your Zhou family's pursuit, so I'll back down.”

“Why didn't you consider the consequences when you attacked my grandson?” Zhou Changsheng's anger surged like a long river as he questioned the Saint Devil.

“I rose from obscurity, with no background or power. Naturally, I must seize every opportunity.” The Saint Devil slightly frowned and continued, “Even for you, a Heavenly King level combatant isn't dispensable, right? Zhou Tian has also forgiven me. I don't want to get tangled up with you over these matters.”

Zhou Changsheng looked at Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian understood his meaning and said, “He's right.”

Receiving the answer from Zhou Tian, Zhou Changsheng fell silent. The Saint Devil was right; a Heavenly King level combatant was indeed not dispensable for them. Although these great powers could dispatch several Heavenly King level experts, in reality, these were the fruits of countless years of accumulation and immense cultivation costs. Every expert was extremely precious. If they could gain one more Heavenly King level expert, it would be extremely beneficial for any force. Moreover, the Saint Devil was a potential seed with a high chance of becoming a Dao Lord.

“Saint Devil, I don't care who is behind you, nor do I care about any deals you've made. However, you should know my Zhou family's rules: once you become a guest elder of my Zhou family, you absolutely cannot lay hands on anyone from my Zhou family again.” Zhou Changsheng remained silent for a long time before finally agreeing. There was no irreconcilable hatred between the Zhou family and the Saint Devil, and Zhou Tian hadn't truly suffered. There was still room for reconciliation.

“I hope our future interactions are pleasant.” The Saint Devil stood up, a smile appearing on his face, revealing his pearly white teeth.

“Your other personality makes me more comfortable,” Zhou Changsheng said coldly.

“Then I'll let him out to say hello to you.” Demonic energy overflowed, and the Devil personality took dominance. He let out a hearty laugh that made the void tremble. “Zhou Changsheng, I never thought I'd become a guest elder of your family one day.”

“Why didn't you seek refuge with the Luo Tian Temple? Weren't you entangled with them?” Zhou Changsheng asked. He and the Saint Devil were figures from the same era, once both prodigies. Though they had fought countless times, they could be considered both enemies and friends.

“Those bald donkeys are not easy to deal with. Besides, they are too mysterious, hiding too many things. I'm afraid I might accidentally be sold off by them.” Under the dominance of the Devil personality, the Saint Devil's character was much more straightforward, speaking directly without many twists and turns.

“Alright, come with me. There's still a set of procedures to go through. Tian'er, I've already informed the people outside. Tianling is waiting for you out there, you can just go out yourself.” Zhou Changsheng said. Becoming a guest elder of the Zhou family meant not only that these individuals would fight for the Zhou family, but the Zhou family would also have to expend many resources. Therefore, it required reporting to the family and setting up many arrangements.

Zhou Changsheng and the Saint Devil departed. Zhou Tian, meanwhile, walked out on his own. It had been a long time since he last saw Tianling, and the thought made him a little excited.

Stepping out, Zhou Tian saw a figure quietly standing there, dressed in white robes and white boots, with black hair like a waterfall and eyes like ripples. She was gazing at Zhou Tian; it was indeed Tianling, whom he hadn't seen in a long time.

A smile appeared on Zhou Tian's face. He quickly walked forward, approaching Tianling, and reached out for a big hug. “Did you miss me?”

“No!” Tianling glared fiercely at Zhou Tian, dodging his embrace. A layer of mist seemed to well up in her eyes.

“Uh… didn't I have Zhang Yi report my safety to you?” Zhou Tian scratched his head, unsure what made the girl angry.

“Zhang Yi? Zhang Yi hasn't returned yet, how could he report your safety to me?” Tianling felt a huge weight lift from her heart, yet a strange emotion brewed within her. Looking at the smiling Zhou Tian in front of her, she couldn't help but feel a lingering resentment.

“……”

Zhou Tian fell silent. Upon closer thought, it hadn't even been a month since Zhang Yi left. Coming from that remote corner to here, the time indeed seemed insufficient. “Should've just come with me back then,” Zhou Tian couldn't help but gloat.

“What do you mean?” Tianling looked bewildered, not knowing what Zhou Tian was talking about.

“Nothing, Zhang Yi is just an unlucky guy.”

Before Zhou Tian and Tianling could continue their tender reunion, a lazy voice drifted from afar. “I said our Prince of Qin's heir would definitely return safe and sound.”

Zhou Zui, Liu Yan, and Li Xuanyi walked over from a distance. Zhou Zui smiled playfully, teasing, “Sister Tianling has been worried sick all this time.”

Liu Yan carried a heavy killing aura, his body radiating scorching heat. A trace of crimson stain remained on the corner of his clothes, as if he had just returned from a battle, as he joked.

Li Xuanyi also nodded at him. He carried a long sword on his back, yet his entire being was as warm and gentle as jade, completely without sharpness. His sword dao had reached a state of perfection.

“Thanks to all of you, I've fortunately returned.” Zhou Tian also laughed. He hadn't seen these friends for some time, and now seeing them, he felt a sense of familiarity. He then asked, “Why are there only three of you? Where are the Third Prince and the others?”

“The Third Prince and the others all went hunting. Those battle maniacs, let alone you, even we rarely see them,” Zhou Zui replied.

“We've greeted you, let's go now. We won't disturb your tender reunion,” Liu Yan said, as they certainly didn't want to stay there as a third wheel.

After the three left, Zhou Tian and Tianling actually didn't stay together for long. Zhou Tian was soon called away by Zhou Changsheng.

Entering the room, Zhou Changsheng sat on a chair, with Mu Su and Ling Yu standing beside him. Zhou Changsheng had already retrieved them from the Saint Devil.

“Senior, Mu Su and I will take our leave then.” Ling Yu was perceptive enough to see that Zhou Changsheng and Zhou Tian had something to discuss. She now also understood that the power behind Zhou Tian was unfathomable, so she dared not be negligent and immediately took her leave.
