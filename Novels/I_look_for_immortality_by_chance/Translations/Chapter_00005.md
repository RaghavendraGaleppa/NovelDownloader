# Chapter 5: Golden Core, Pink Eyes  

*Boom!*  

It was as if a crimson sun had exploded in midair. Surging power swept through everything in an instant, illuminating the long-darkened cavern with piercing brightness.  

*Whoosh!*  

The black demonic light that had already pierced the skin between Gu Yuan's eyebrows turned to dust in the blink of an eye.  

For the first time, Gu Yuan felt an unprecedented sense of security.  

Even though he was in a demonic cavern, he felt as steady as Mount Tai.  

A cyan lotus, cold and gleaming, slowly materialized in the air. Its petals rotated, carrying an aura so sharp it resembled countless swords. The dense killing intent seemed capable of piercing the heavens.  

Upon the lotus throne, a breathtakingly beautiful silhouette gradually appeared.  

*Sss!*  

Gu Yuan raised his head, wanting to glimpse the figure's face. But the moment he did, his eyes stung with pain. The figure seemed composed of countless sword lights—radiant, sharp, and blinding like the sun. He couldn't even bear to look directly at it.  

He had no choice but to lower his head quickly.  

"Where did you obtain this token?"  

A cold, clear voice descended from above, reaching Gu Yuan's ears.  

"Honored Senior, I found it on the skeleton within this cavern!"  

Gu Yuan had known the token contained immense power, but he never expected it could summon a conscious projection.  

Facing such a figure, he dared not conceal anything and answered truthfully.  

A gaze sharp enough to pierce the soul swept through the cavern. Even the thick demonic miasma couldn't obscure it. A rumbling sound echoed in Gu Yuan's ears as dust filled the air. The jade-like skeleton slowly rose and floated into the projection's hands.  

The vast cavern fell into silence, but an unspoken sorrow permeated the air.  

Gu Yuan's heart stirred—he seemed to understand something.  

The skeleton in this cavern must have belonged to someone from a major faction, protected by a powerful backer who had bestowed this token for safety. But for some reason, the token had been enveloped by that eerie demonic mist, preventing its activation and leading to the skeleton's demise.  

Gu Yuan, relying on the opportunity provided by the stone liquid, was the first to discover the skeleton and reactivate the token, summoning this projection.  

But what level of power did this projection possess?  

Would the opportunity mentioned by the stone liquid come to fruition? Could he escape this demonic cavern and see the light of day again?  

Just as Gu Yuan was lost in thought but didn't dare speak, a flustered voice suddenly echoed from outside the cavern:  

"Fire Dragon Child of the Flaming Dragon Sect pays respects to the Golden Core Venerable!"  

"Junior was unaware that a disciple of the Venerable was here. I acted recklessly—please forgive me, Venerable! Please forgive me!"  

The old man outside the cavern had lost all composure. His face was tense with fear as he repeatedly begged for forgiveness.  

Yet his true body remained outside the cavern, his eyes filled with deep vigilance.  

Gu Yuan was also shocked.  

A Golden Core Venerable!  

A truly terrifying existence beyond the Foundation Establishment realm!  

"Is this Demonic Star Cavern under your jurisdiction?"  

The cold voice spoke again, this time questioning Fire Dragon Child.  

Accompanying the words was a dazzling, chilling sword light.  

Sweat dripped from Fire Dragon Child's temples as he hastily explained, "Venerable, please understand! This stone mine originally belonged to the Demonic Mist Sect. I only came here today to purge the demonic sect. Everything that happened in this cavern has nothing to do with my sect!"  

"How many years has the Demonic Mist Sect operated this mine?"  

"Fifty-six years!"  

"Which sect owned it before?"  

"Before... it belonged to the Heaven-Severing Sect. But for unknown reasons, the sect leader perished, and the sect declined until it was swallowed by the Demonic Mist Sect!"  

"Venerable, the Demonic Mist Sect has committed countless atrocities, disregarding the laws of the Heavenly Palace and wantonly conquering sects large and small. In just a few decades, they've already destroyed three sects and seven factions! My sect, to uphold the Heavenly Palace's authority, allied with the Tianyuan Sect to crusade against them!"  

"Now that the Venerable has arrived, this sect will be annihilated in a single day!"  

Fire Dragon Child answered while subtly probing, then bowed deeply.  

But the cold voice only uttered a faint phrase—"Heavenly Palace laws"—as if sighing, before turning its gaze back to Gu Yuan.  

Gu Yuan felt the gaze but didn't dare raise his head. Suppressing the pain in his organs, he cupped his hands in salute.  

"Sixty years ago, my disciple's life lamp extinguished, her soul scattered. Enraged, I vowed to hunt down her killer, but the threads of fate were severed. Despite exhausting all means, I couldn't divine the location of her death."  

"I once declared within my sect that whoever could uncover the truth of this matter would be granted a request."  

"But the Southern Mountain Domain is vast. Decades passed with no leads, and I abandoned this hope."  

"Yet now, after all these years, you activated the token."  

"I've roughly understood the cause. Since you've fulfilled my wish, I shall grant you a request. Speak—what do you desire?"  

As these words were spoken, the oppressive, icy aura vanished, replaced by a radiance like the sun.  

Under this light, Gu Yuan felt the wounds in his organs healing rapidly. The shattered bones in his right hand mended in an instant.  

*Crack!*  

Not only that, the unbreakable Spirit-Severing Shackle on his wrist shattered into dust, scattering into the darkness.  

*Rustle...*  

Familiar spiritual energy once again flowed through his body. His skin regained its healthy glow, and all the filth and grime were swept away by the spiritual energy.  

Though his clothes remained tattered and his feet bare, the transcendent aura of a cultivator had returned.  

Suppressing his joy, Gu Yuan recalled his circumstances and the wisdom imparted by Zhou Shuren in his past life. Without hesitation, he dropped to his knees with a *thud*, kowtowing sincerely as he cried out:  

"Senior has lost a disciple, and this junior has lost his sect! If the Senior does not disdain me, please take me in as your disciple, and let me serve you!"  

The kneel was decisive!  

The plea was heartfelt!  

Just like that ruthless palm strike he had delivered to Senior Brother Yang earlier—utterly decisive!  

Fire Dragon Child, witnessing this, couldn't help but freeze momentarily.  

This brat, with his thick eyebrows and honest, handsome face, was unexpectedly shameless in his actions!  

A mere destitute Qi Refining cultivator from a fallen sect, daring to ask to become a Golden Core Venerable's disciple?!  

Why not pee on the ground and look at your reflection first?  

Why not just offer to support the Venerable in their old age while you're at it?  

The Venerable said they'd grant you a request, and you actually took it seriously?  

Aren't you afraid the Venerable would despise your audacity and slap you to death?  

Fire Dragon Child sneered inwardly, but then a sudden realization struck him. He looked at Gu Yuan in surprise.  

Could this kid be...?  

Sure enough, after a brief silence, the cold voice spoke again:  

"My lineage only accepts female disciples. Moreover, you are already grown and have your own cultivation. It would be difficult for any elder in my sect to take you in."  

"However, since I made a promise, I will not go back on my word."  

"Raise your head."  

Gu Yuan obediently lifted his head.  

What met his eyes was a face of unparalleled beauty. Unlike the cold voice, this visage was enchantingly alluring.  

Jet-black hair fluttered like silk, framing a face as delicate as peach blossoms. Her snow-white skin was like ice, and beneath willow-leaf eyebrows were a pair of pink eyes.  

It was the first time Gu Yuan had ever seen pink irises.  

They were mesmerizing.  

A stark contrast to the cold, deadly sword intent she exuded.  

*Pfft!*  

A sharp pain in his fingertip snapped Gu Yuan out of his daze.  

Only then did he notice that the green token engraved with vines and emerald leaves had somehow returned to his palm.  

Moreover, a drop of his blood had fallen onto the token, which trembled slightly, as if forming a faint spiritual connection with him.  

"I am an elder of the Azure Peak Dao Academy. This is my token. Take it to Azure Peak Mountain, and you may enroll in the academy. As for whether you can become a disciple of any elder, that will depend on your fortune."  

"This token belongs solely to you—none may impersonate you."  

"This matter is settled. I hope you make the most of it."  

The cold voice faded as the immense power within the token was drawn out, transforming into a rainbow light that wrapped around the skeleton and vanished toward the north in an instant.  

Only a faint spiritual presence remained in the token.  

Fire Dragon Child watched the scene unfold, sighing inwardly.  

This thick-browed brat knew how to play people.  

Knowing full well he couldn't become the Golden Core Venerable's disciple, he boldly made the request anyway—forcing the Venerable to compromise and allow him into the academy.  

Had he asked to join the academy from the start, he might have been refused and only given some rewards.  

It was like complaining that a room was too dark and asking to open a window—people would refuse. But if you suggested tearing off the roof, they'd agree to the window.  

Raise expectations first, then settle for the middle ground.  

Easier said than done, though.  

After all, this was a Golden Core Venerable!  

A single burst of anger could reduce someone to ashes in an instant.  

Yet this kid actually pulled it off.  

Such luck, such boldness—truly extraordinary.  

Fire Dragon Child marveled silently, already deciding how he should treat Gu Yuan from now on.
