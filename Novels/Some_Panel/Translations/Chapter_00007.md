# Chapter 7: Little Brother, We Really Are the Best Partners

Bang! Bang! Bang! Everyone discovered that the falling raindrops on the deck sizzled, emitting green smoke and coiling with electric snakes. They instantly melted parts of the reinforced iron, dripping small holes into it.

"This!" Seeing this scene, Chen De was instantly shocked.

"The raindrops falling from the sky actually contain the power of lightning, and each drop is so terrifying. This is not ordinary rain; if we don't resist it, the large ship will likely be pierced through very soon. Who knows how long this rain will last? If we lose the protection of the ship, we will all die in the ocean." Chen De made a decisive decision, ordering everyone to activate the defensive formation.

The others also witnessed this scene, instantly understanding why Jin Dafu was so generous and no longer bothered by the spiritual stones. Compared to spiritual stones, life was clearly more precious.

"Quick, quick, quick! Don't just stand there stunned!" Seeing small holes dripping into the ship, Jin Dafu's face turned pale, and he urged them quickly.

Hearing this, everyone exerted their full strength and activated the formation.

Buzz! As the defensive formation activated, a layer of spiritual light instantly expanded over the entire surface of the large ship, blocking out the raindrops. The ship's voyage gradually stabilized.

But before everyone could breathe a sigh of relief, they heard a sudden crackling and exploding sound rip through the sky, as if the heavens themselves had burst open.

Everyone's hearts pounded. They quickly looked out and were instantly scared out of their wits. Lightning filled the sky, coiling and twisting like electric snakes within the dark clouds, dyeing the entire firmament purple.

"This, this is..." Jin Dafu was utterly terrified. This was actually the Heavenly Extreme Violet Thunder, filling the sky.

"Heavens, the Heavenly Extreme Violet Thunder!" Everyone's guts turned to water, their eyeballs nearly popping out of their sockets.

The large ship had just changed direction, speeding forward five *li*, and in the blink of an eye, torrents of lightning, and furthermore, the most terrifying Heavenly Extreme Violet Thunder, crashed down behind them. If they had been even a step slower, they would have been annihilated in an instant, not even a speck of bone dust remaining.

Everyone felt a chill run through their bodies, a wave of lingering fear, and their bodies continued to tremble. If they had been a moment too late, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Thankfully, they had made a decisive choice, fully activating the formation and accelerating to burst five *li* away.

But even so, the lightning power that seeped through the seawater still covered the entire ship's hull, wrapped in electric snakes, emanating a chilling purple light. Upon touching the electric snakes, everyone's bodies went numb, their spiritual energy became difficult to circulate, and their skin was covered with purple patterns, burning unbearably, cracking inch by inch. Yet, compared to what was behind them, they were now in heaven, incredibly fortunate. Behind them was already a purgatory, crackling and bursting! Extreme Violet Lightning as thick as water buckets continuously blanketed the area, connecting heaven and earth, as if a thunder-prison had manifested, terrifying beyond measure.

The powerful lightning force slammed into the sea, plunging a hundred *zhang* deep. The entire sea area trembled, instantly stirring up terrifying waves, like a thick, colossal wall, dancing with electric snakes. Purple, the sea, and the sky were all a deep, dark purple. Everywhere was filled with deafening crackling sounds, terrifying heavenly might pervaded all directions, the air collapsed, and space tore.

It was hard to imagine what kind of despair they would face if they were caught inside. Simply horrifying!

A hundred-li radius was a sea of thunder. When had any of them ever seen such a sight? They were truly scared half to death. They had only read about the Heavenly Extreme Violet Thunder in books; never had they experienced its terror so vividly as now.

"Quick, quick, quick, get out of this cursed place! Don't worry about wasting my spiritual stones!" Jin Dafu was already speaking incoherently from fright.

Everyone's hearts turned cold. Without Jin Dafu needing to say more, they frantically activated the formation, wishing they could make the large ship fly directly away from this sea area. It wasn't until they had sailed tens of *li* away that they looked back at the thunder-prison from a distance, still feeling lingering fear. Only when the sea of thunder was no longer visible did everyone finally breathe a heavy sigh of relief.

...

"Little friend, thank you so much this time." Chen De exhaled, turning to Yang Ji with a gentle smile.

"Indeed, it's truly thanks to Fellow Daoist Yang's warning this time, otherwise, we would all have died in that sea of thunder," a group of cultivators said gratefully, cupping their hands.

"Little Brother Yang, you truly are my lucky star! Thankfully, you warned us, and I acted decisively, which allowed us to avoid this calamity. We are truly a perfect match, the best partners!" Jin Dafu's face showed no trace of his previous resentment; instead, he laughed heartily.

What a character! Yang Ji looked at Jin Dafu, whose emotions shifted seamlessly, and couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

"Come, come, Little Brother Yang, please take a seat!" Jin Dafu warmly pulled him to sit down, then chuckled, "Little brother, I never expected you to have such a talent for avoiding danger and seeking good fortune. It's truly enviable. I've decided, from now on, you'll be our Myriad Treasure Pavilion's Ship Guardian."

Such thick skin! I haven't even agreed yet, and you're already giving me the title of Ship Guardian? Businessmen truly are sly and worldly; he was just complaining about my spiritual stones earlier, Yang Ji couldn't help but roll his eyes at him inwardly. At this moment, he also smiled faintly, subtly rubbing his index finger and thumb together in front of Jin Dafu, while saying meaningfully, "Easy to say, easy to say!"

Jin Dafu saw his gesture, his eyes clearly paused for a moment, then he burst into loud laughter:

"Haha, Little Brother Yang, these thousand spiritual stones are your remuneration for this trip. Our Myriad Treasure Pavilion is immensely powerful, with businesses spread across all the major islands in the Thousand Isles Sea. Becoming our Ship Guardian, little brother, you won't be at a disadvantage. In the future, for every level your cultivation increases, your fee will increase by two hundred spiritual stones on top of the thousand. We won't treat you unfairly." As he spoke, he looked at Chen De and the other cultivators, chuckling, "Little Brother Yang, as Ship Guardian, his remuneration for this trip is a thousand spiritual stones. Do any of you have any objections?"

"No objections, no objections, this is what Fellow Daoist Yang deserves," the crowd replied with kindly smiles.

Looking at the thousand spiritual stones floating before him, wrapped in spiritual energy, Yang Ji's eyes lit up. He thought to himself, *Dafu is a person I can deal with; he knows the ropes!* He also unceremoniously waved his hand, collecting all thousand spiritual stones into his storage.

In fact, this was also a tacit agreement to Jin Dafu's request to become the Ship Guardian. Yang Ji had learned about the Myriad Treasure Pavilion from books. It was an industry of a cultivation family, the Jin family, which had several Golden Core cultivators overseeing it. Their influence spread across all the major islands in the Thousand Isles Sea and they had intricate connections with the three major sects. Their power was undeniably formidable. If he could establish even a slight connection with this Jin Dafu, future transactions might become much more convenient. Moreover, earning a thousand spiritual stones for one trip out to sea was a sure-fire, profitable business.

Yang Ji readily agreed.

"Little friend, your ability to foresee danger is truly strong. Did you cultivate it later in life?" Chen De, like a refined scholar, smiled gently.

"Senior, you jest," Yang Ji said, shaking his head with a chuckle. "Even Soul Transformation mighty cultivators find it difficult to cultivate such an ability to foresee danger; how could a small Qi Condensation cultivator like me achieve it? Perhaps it's an aftereffect from seeing too many great horrors in my past life. Of course, it's also hit-or-miss; it has only come true three times."

"Oh, so that's how it is!" Chen De's expression flickered slightly.
