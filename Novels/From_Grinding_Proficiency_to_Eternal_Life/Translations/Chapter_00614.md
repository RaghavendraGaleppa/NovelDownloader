# Chapter 614: Clash of Sword Intent

Yang Jian's golden light, Nezha's fire spear, and the demon monkey's purple-gold staff—all were pierced through by a single, fine line, their afterimages dimming.

This Peak Seventh Rank Celestial Starry Sky Great Array, capable of drawing upon the power of the stars beyond the realm to form a supreme trapping and killing formation, had actually been breached. A fatal flaw appeared before the supreme, scorching sword intent that Ye Yuan had poured his entire life's comprehension of the Dao into.

Sword intent, being profound, could naturally kill those of a higher realm.

This platinum fine line was the绝杀 (ultimate kill) that Ye Yuan had sacrificed everything for, igniting the phenomenon of 'No Return to the Other Shore' to achieve.

Its speed surpassed the limit of what divine sense could capture.

In an instant, this white line, which symbolized the ultimate mystery of Ye Yuan's sword path, ignored the array's barrier and suddenly appeared three inches before Xu Yunfan's brow.

Death had never felt so close.

Faced with this supreme, scorching, ultimate kill sword that had already surpassed the Foundation Establishment level, contained a trace of the golden nature of immortality, and was designed to sever all life, any calculations or hesitations in Xu Yunfan's mind, any thought of controlling the array, were crushed to dust in a ten-thousandth of an instant.

All that remained was the purest, most primal survival instinct and the fighting reflexes honed through a thousand life-and-death trials.

In this moment of life and death, there was only one choice: to fight!

"ROAR!!!"

A roar that pierced the soul erupted from Xu Yunfan's chest.

Deep within his eyes, the cold rationality completely faded away, leaving only a rage that could burn the heavens.

The Martial Dao Sky Eye instantly opened to its limit, the vertical pupil within erupting with golden light, as if igniting two burning suns.

Rage! Rage! Rage!

This rage was not like a river without a source or a tree without roots.

Its source was deeply rooted in his indignation towards Ye Yuan's overwhelming power, his contempt for Lu Chuan and the others' betrayal, the humiliation and unwillingness he felt as his own strength was tested生死 (life and death), and the violent killing intent of the restless souls beneath his sword.

His journey had been like walking on thin ice, with the path ahead monopolized by the high and mighty True Lords, naturally filling his heart with anger.

These damn Golden Core True Lords were no different from the capitalists of his previous life!

For their own selfish desires, they strangled the channels for upward mobility.

The idea of 'the first to get rich helping the others to get rich' was just a performance, with no real substance.

Martial Dao Sky Eye, activate!

Xu Yunfan entered the Dao through the Martial Path, refined his five organs and six viscera through the Nine Layers of Heavenly Thunder and Fire, drew in the Heavenly Stem Metal's killing qi of the universe, tempered his bones, forged his meridians, and ground his marrow, making his physical body clear and flawless, like divine iron forged by heaven into the Divine霄 Immortal Body.

Now, the blood flowing through his veins was no longer mere Martial Dao Gangsha, but a purer, more vast power that had fused with the explosive nature of thunder.

The deep-seated, brawling, violent, and fierce nature of a warrior, hidden within his bloodline, was forcefully ignited by the Martial Dao Sky Eye.

The moment his rage was ignited, the blood in his hundred bones boiled like magma.

His pores all over his body seemed to erupt with thunder and fire, and every single hair stood on end.

The immense vital energy instantly broke through the shackles of reason, entering a berserk state far beyond his normal peak.

The purple-gold thunder patterns all over his body shone with a piercing brilliance. The Divine霄 Immortal Body emitted faint creaking sounds, as if unable to bear the strain, but its power suddenly increased by several points.

However, this was only the foundation.

The essence of the 'Rage Kill' lies in its 'intent', not its 'power'!

The interaction of heaven and earth, the separation and union of yin and yang.

In that lightning-fast moment, the exquisite Dao principles of the *Classic of the Interaction of Heaven and Earth and the Separation and Union of Yin and Yang* operated violently within Xu Yunfan's Sea of Consciousness.

This supreme art, obtained from the Hundred Desires Peak, has as its core mystery the comprehension, control, and ignition of a living being's most essential seven emotions and six desires, twisting their heart and turning it to his own use.

It can be said that it can play with the seven emotions and six desires of living beings in the palm of its hand.

Usually, the direct disciples of Hundred Desires Peak practice this art by draining others, draining the essence of heaven and earth to cultivate.

But now, he did the opposite, applying the uncanny power of this art to himself.

He used his will as a guide, and the Hundred Desires secret technique as a bridge, to ignite the violent rage deep within his Sea of Consciousness.

His spiritual will, like a torrent released from a floodgate, instantly poured into the 'Rage Kill Sword Intent' that he had previously understood from his clone Han Shi and had been perfectly deduced and branded into the depths of his Sea of Consciousness by his attribute panel.

The essence of the *Thousand Chariots庚 Sea Raging Waves Sword Manual*, the嫡传 secret method of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect that his clone Han Shi practiced, was now fully understood by Xu Yunfan.

The Rage Kill Sword Intent—the more intense the rage, the stronger the sword intent.

Under Xu Yunfan's extreme operation of using his body to引怒 (draw rage) and his spirit to ignite it, it unexpectedly achieved a perfect resonance with the Hundred Desires Peak's secret technique of controlling the seven emotions and six desires.

The Rage Kill Sword Intent, manifested.

Hum!

Clang!!

The True Martial Sword in Xu Yunfan's hand, as if sensing its master's extreme rage that could burn the eight desolations, erupted with a passionate sword cry that could pierce metal and shatter stone.

The fine purple arcs of electricity on the ancient sword body were instantly replaced by a sinister sword light, blood-red in color yet tinged with purple-gold thunder light.

That light was filled with destruction and madness, along with a fanatical obsession to tear apart the existence before him, even if it meant sacrificing everything.

The True Martial Sword's true meaning of 'swaying magic and slaying evil' was now, under the influence of this extreme and fierce Rage Kill intent originating from itself, forcibly twisted, stained with a layer of tragic blood-colored锋芒 (sharp edge).

This Rage Kill Sword Intent that bloomed in an instant no longer had any trace of array flow, nor the empowerment of the celestial stars' power.

The magical power in Xu Yunfan's body, like boiling volcanic magma, poured into the body of the True Martial Sword without reservation.

He gripped the sword with both hands, his movement simple to the extreme.

There were no profound changes in sword techniques, only the most simple and direct upward slash.

Using the rage in his heart as a guide, drawing upon the violent nature of his bloodline as a foundation, he spurred on the律动 (rhythm) of the Ten Thousand Chariots' Raging Waves.

The Rage Kill Sword Gang, a mixture of blood-red and purple-gold, surged forth from the tip of the True Martial Sword.

It was not majestic and grand, but like a torrent of destruction erupting from the depths of the Nine Hells.

It was not a grand and righteous path, but filled with the most primitive and tragic will to kill.

The power of this sword, multiplied several times by Xu Yunfan's own extreme fury, boldly met the supreme platinum sword line that contained a trace of the golden nature's immortal mystery.

BOOM!!!

Two sword intents of completely opposite natures but equally tragic and overbearing collided violently at the core of the void, three inches before Xu Yunfan's brow.

No sound of propagation could describe this moment's collision. The space itself seemed to warp and collapse, light was devoured and then erupted.

The platinum fine line represented the unyielding, unreturning path of severing all things.

The blood-red, purple-gold torrent represented the violent, rage-filled path of burning all creation.

This was a collision of wills.

It was the peak interpretation of the paths they each pursued.

It was a desperate gamble from a late Foundation Establishment cultivator against someone who had half a foot in the realm of seeking gold.

The True Martial Sword let out a mournful tremor. Its body shook violently under the impact of that peerless, sharp, and unyielding platinum sword intent. The虎口 (tiger's mouth) of Xu Yunfan's hands split open instantly, his blood staining the sword's hilt.

But the sword gang, which had combined his vital energy and rage from entering the Dao through the Martial Path, the rage ignited by his spirit through the Hundred Desires secret technique, and the sublimated true meaning of the Ten Thousand Chariots' Rage Kill, did not immediately collapse despite the absolute disadvantage.

Within the blood-red, purple-gold sword light, the blood color rapidly faded, while the purple-gold thunder light flashed frantically, desperately withstanding that unreturning platinum sword intent.

Blood trickled from Xu Yunfan's mouth and nose. His eyes were crimson red. The Divine霄 Immortal Body, under the shockwaves of the collision between those two terrifying wills, cracked with a spiderweb-like pattern.

Fine mists of blood sprayed from the acupoints all over his body, instantly vaporized by the violent energy into a猩红 (crimson) haze.
