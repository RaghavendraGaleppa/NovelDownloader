# Chapter 13: The Mantis Stalks the Cicada, Unaware of the Oriole Behind

Outside Butian Peak, over a dozen official disciples had gathered. Leading them were none other than Zhao Xuhe, Fairy Qingchen, and Elder Wang Bairong of the Scripture Pavilion. Among all present, only these three were at the Mid-Qi Condensation Stage.

Zhao Xuhe stood at the very front, his voice booming, "Zhao is deeply honored that all of you martial brothers and sisters have answered my call. I extend my sincerest gratitude in advance." After speaking, he bowed to the crowd.

"To be frank, I discovered an ancient cave dwelling left by a predecessor outside Butian Peak. However, it's protected by a formation that I alone am unable to breach."

Fairy Qingchen chimed in at the opportune moment, her soft, delicate voice making one's bones tingle, "That's why Qingchen sought out all of you martial brothers and sisters. If we combine our strength to break the formation, we can divide the spoils within the cave dwelling equally. Senior Brother Zhao is a member of the Three Rivers Association, and his reputation is well-known to all. He certainly won't let anyone suffer a loss."

Zhao Xuhe clearly possessed some cunning. He and Fairy Qingchen cooperated seamlessly, while Elder Wang Bairong of the Scripture Pavilion naturally played along, echoing their words. Soon, the initially disparate group of people was united as one.

Immediately after, the group rode their evasion lights and departed from Butian Peak.

The "Heaven-Reaching Cloud Sea" where the Primordial Saint Sect was located stretched immensely, almost without end. The group flew for a quarter of an hour before finally halting in a section of the cloud sea.

"This is the place." With a thought, Zhao Xuhe's true qi parted the cloud sea, revealing a magnificent mountain peak with excellent Feng Shui, resembling an old dragon coiled in slumber.

"This place is called Coiling Dragon Isle," Zhao Xuhe proactively introduced. "I've investigated it. It was once the cave dwelling of a True Disciple of our sect, True Person Coiling Dragon. The Feng Shui Grand Array outside was once even a Foundation Establishment Grand Array. However, after many years, the earth veins it relied upon have dried up, and its power is less than one-tenth of its original strength."

"Everyone, please follow me to break the formation." As his voice fell, Zhao Xuhe took the lead, being the first to enter Coiling Dragon Isle. The others, seeing this, naturally dared not fall behind and flew in one by one.

After a moment, a figure quietly emerged.

"Interesting..." Lu Yang gazed at Coiling Dragon Isle below, yet had no intention of entering. Instead, he took out four black banners and began setting up a formation outside the island.

"Anyway, the repayment deadline is approaching, and my time in this life is running out."

"Might as well pull off a big job!"

"But Coiling Dragon Isle is mysterious and unpredictable. Zhao Xuhe's side has many people. I alone wouldn't stand a chance. Entering to compete for opportunities with them would be a losing battle."

After much thought, Lu Yang came up with a good idea. Firstly, he utterly disbelieved the notion that there were "good people" even within the Demonic Sect. Thus, he was convinced that Zhao Xuhe's scheme to lure people into the cave dwelling was absolutely malicious. However, so many people had come this time, including Elder Wang Bairong of the Scripture Pavilion. Even if Zhao Xuhe could devour them all, he would inevitably chip a few teeth and wouldn't emerge unscathed. Given this, Lu Yang might as well set up a formation outside the island first, waiting for them at his leisure, specifically to ambush those who came out. Wouldn't this be far more cost-effective than going in to explore?

For this purpose, Lu Yang had even used his last 100 contribution points to exchange for a set of Illusory Trace Array banners. The four "Illusory Trace Banners" could lock down the heavens and earth and reverse directions. Although they had no offensive power, they could trap people within, making it difficult to escape in a short time.

"Now, all that's left is to wait quietly... No rush, patience is key." Lu Yang patiently laid in ambush.

"Zhao Xuhe! What do you mean by this?!"

"If you kill us, our life lamps will extinguish, and the Saint Sect will not spare you!"

Inside Coiling Dragon Isle, blood flowed like rivers. The official disciples who had just been working together were now fighting for themselves, crying out in agony, their lives constantly harvested by a streak of crimson light.

Away from the crowd, Zhao Xuhe and Fairy Qingchen stood side by side. Their expressions were mocking, their brows arrogant, exuding an eerie malevolence. Their words and actions were completely different from the sincere demeanor they had shown when inviting everyone earlier.

Facing the curses of the crowd, Zhao Xuhe merely sneered, his voice chilling, "There's no need to struggle. This place was meticulously arranged by me. This 'Blood Demon Soul-Slaying Blade' alone cost me a full 3000 contribution points. Today, not a single one of you will escape Coiling Dragon Isle!"

As he spoke, several more lives were claimed. The crimson light flashed in the air, instantly absorbing their flesh and blood, then revealed its form: a blood-red flying blade.

"You! Bastard!"

Among the crowd, the only one who could still resist was Elder Wang Bairong of the Scripture Pavilion. Yet, Zhao Xuhe was not in a hurry to kill him, only constantly wearing him down. As he did so, Zhao Xuhe continued to mock him with a cold laugh, "Old Wang, did you really think you'd live to spend the money you took from me? The reason I bought those Death-Substitute Golems from you back then was for today! Otherwise, if you had a pile of them, it wouldn't be easy for me to take you down."

"Now, all your Death-Substitute Golems have been bought by me."

"Once I kill you, I can still get back the contribution points I gave you. It's like I acquired a pile of Death-Substitute Golems without spending a single point."

"Looking at it that way, I should thank you!"

Zhao Xuhe's soul-crushing words infuriated Wang Bairong to the point of almost spitting blood. Zhao Xuhe seized the opportunity, and with a flash of the flying blade, it plunged directly into his chest.

*Thump!*

Wang Bairong's lips trembled, his face filled with unwillingness, but he couldn't utter a single word before the flying blade sucked him dry of all blood and qi, and he finally collapsed to the ground.

With Wang Bairong dealt with, the dust settled. After another moment, the sounds of agony gradually ceased.

"Congratulations, Senior Brother!" Fairy Qingchen was also drenched in sweat. The Blood Demon Soul-Slaying Blade consumed a great deal of energy, and her contribution was undeniable in Zhao Xuhe's success in slaughtering so many.

"And many thanks to you, Junior Sister." Zhao Xuhe smiled faintly, retracting the Blood Demon Soul-Slaying Blade into his hand. He inquired, "How is it? With its current power, can it break through that restriction?"

Fairy Qingchen observed for a moment, her delicate brows slightly furrowed. "It seems to be just a little bit short..."

*Swish—!*

The blade went in and out. Fairy Qingchen's beautiful face wore a bewildered expression, her eyes vacant as she stared at the crimson flying blade embedded in her lower abdomen. In the blink of an eye, she too was sucked dry into a desiccated corpse.

"Now it's enough." Zhao Xuhe looked at the Blood Demon Soul-Slaying Blade in his hand and finally nodded in satisfaction. He then proceeded to a tightly sealed quiet room deep within Coiling Dragon Isle. Without a word, he raised the blade and struck.

*Boom!*

With a thunderous crash that shook the earth, the door of the quiet room shattered, revealing its interior. There, a jade casket was prominently displayed.

Zhao Xuhe walked up, his face filled with wild joy. He opened the jade casket to find two volumes of Daoist scriptures inside. The upper volume was titled "Nine Transformations Dragon Arts." The lower volume was titled "Myriad Carriage Dragon Ascent Treasure Scroll."

Looking at the two Daoist scriptures in the jade casket, Zhao Xuhe's hands trembled with excitement. "A Third-Grade True Art! It truly is a Third-Grade True Art that leads directly to the Golden Core Dao!"

"Master truly didn't deceive me."

"Master said that I cultivated diligently for three lifetimes, accumulating merit for True Person Coiling Dragon. In this life, my merits are finally complete, and True Person Coiling Dragon's legacy is my destined opportunity."

"From today onwards, as long as I cultivate diligently, refine the 'True Dragon Qi,' and forge the 'Myriad Carriage Dragon Control' Dao Foundation, I will surely regain my true self and fully return from reincarnation. And with a Third-Grade True Art, not only will the path to Foundation Establishment be smooth, but the Golden Core Dao will also be within reach!"

The more Zhao Xuhe thought, the more excited he became, and he immediately put away the Daoist scriptures. "Changing cultivation arts requires dispersing my current cultivation. There's no time to lose; I must immediately return to my cave dwelling and enter seclusion. Once I emerge, I can formally pledge allegiance to Master."

Clutching his hopes for the future, Zhao Xuhe activated his evasion light and swiftly flew out of Coiling Dragon Isle.

However, in the next second, Zhao Xuhe's expression suddenly changed drastically.

"Who—"

*Boom!*

In that instant, Zhao Xuhe's eyes widened, but all he saw was a magnificent sword light, like a bolt of lightning, striking directly before him!
