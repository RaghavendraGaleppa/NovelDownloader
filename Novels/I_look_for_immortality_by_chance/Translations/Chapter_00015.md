# Chapter 15: The Mysterious Jade Pillar

"Boom!"

The heavy stone door swung open after fifteen long years of silence.

Having remained uninhabited for so long, the spirit stones powering the dust-repelling formation at the heart of the cave abode had dimmed completely. A thick cloud of dust billowed out like mist.

Gu Yuan's mana automatically circulated, forming a protective barrier that kept the dust at bay as he stepped inside. Retrieving a spirit stone from his storage pouch, he placed it into the cave's formation array.

"Hummm!"

After years of dormancy, the formation sprang back to life. The dust in the cave was swept away as if by an invisible hand, vanishing in the blink of an eye until the entire abode was spotless once more.

Not only that—thick formation patterns as wide as a wrist lit up throughout the cave, emitting a soft white glow that instantly illuminated the space as bright as day. Within the white light, faint traces of warmth rose like the sun's rays.

"If I returned to Earth now, just these dust-repelling and daylight formations alone would make me a fortune," Gu Yuan mused, suddenly reminded of his past life as he took in the pristine, well-lit, and tranquil cave.

Though civilization in his previous life had been advanced, it paled in comparison to the refinement of this world when it came to cleaning and artificial lighting. This was precisely the wonder of cultivation.

Shaking his head to clear the nostalgic thoughts, Gu Yuan began inspecting the cave before him.

The abode was vast. 

This world was boundless, and land held little value. An entire mountainside housed only three cave abodes, each expansive beyond imagination.

At the front of the cave appeared to be a reception area—behind an ornamental screen stood a spacious arrangement of tables and chairs, free from the cramped feeling typical of mountain dwellings.

Next was a small medicinal herb garden.

The presence of an herb garden inside the cave took Gu Yuan by surprise. 

The plot wasn't large, seemingly filled with transplanted spirit soil, painstakingly arranged to cultivate basic herbs like "Luminous Grass" and "Flesh-Restoring Grass" alongside the spiritual veins. These shade-loving spirit herbs had thrived over the years without sunlight, their quality surprisingly good.

This small garden alone was worth five or six spirit stones—an unexpected windfall.

Pleased, Gu Yuan grew even more eager about the "opportunity" hidden within the cave. 

For this chance, he had risked offending a Foundation Establishment family and even lightly "rebuked" Qiu Mingshan. Both parties far surpassed him in strength.

Recalling Lan Tianlu's shifting expression when he had chosen this cave, Gu Yuan sighed inwardly. 

His deliberate misdirection had revealed the truth—Lan Tianlu clearly knew there was something unusual about this cave, or his demeanor wouldn't have changed so noticeably.

But now, there was no turning back. Gu Yuan could only press forward.

---

The cave's layout was orderly and expansive, having hollowed out nearly a third of the mountainside. Reception area, herb garden, alchemy chamber, artifact-forging room, small spirit pool, sleeping quarters, and kitchen—all were present. 

Though cultivators devoted themselves to rigorous practice, they spared no expense when it came to their dwellings. This also reflected the immense wealth of the Azure Peak Dao Academy.

Even a mere Qi Refining disciple's cave was this spacious—a testament to the abundance of spiritual veins.

Gu Yuan quickly skimmed past these areas, striding straight toward the deepest part of the cave.

This was the smallest chamber in the abode, yet also the most spirit-rich—the cultivation room, the heart of the cave.

Intricate formation patterns crisscrossed the floor, converging at a central meditation mat. Thick spiritual energy had condensed into misty tendrils, floating lazily in the chamber.

After fifteen years without a cultivator, the cave had accumulated a substantial amount of spiritual energy.

But Gu Yuan's gaze skipped past the mat and the mist, landing directly on a jade pillar at the side of the chamber.

The pillar stood three feet tall, its entire body a translucent green. The eastern-facing side was carved with intricate patterns so lifelike they seemed to breathe—a crane with wings spread mid-flight.

The crane's image was vivid yet carried a hint of ferocity, its sharp beak carved with such precision it appeared ready to pierce flesh.

At the pillar's summit sat a delicate jade cup, crystalline and thin as a cicada's wing. Connected seamlessly to the pillar, the cup held a slowly swirling liquid of bluish-green hue.

"Azure Crane Spirit Water!"

"It really is Azure Crane Spirit Water?!"

After carefully inspecting the surroundings for traps, Gu Yuan approached the pillar and confirmed that the liquid in the cup matched Lan Tianlu's description.

Though Qiu Mingshan had already explained the origins of the cave and the spirit water, seeing it in person still stunned Gu Yuan.

"The stone liquid indicated that the cave's depths held an opportunity nearly pure silver in hue!"

"Azure Crane Spirit Water is precious, but it's merely a spiritual water for the Qi Refining stage's Divine Sense breakthrough. At best, it should be cyan tinged with traces of silver—how could it be nearly pure silver?"

Gu Yuan frowned in confusion.

He had come to understand the stone liquid's indications well.

Items worth a few spirit stones that barely affected one's circumstances appeared as white dots.

Treasures valued at hundreds of spirit stones, capable of resolving minor crises and slightly altering one's fate, manifested as cyan dots.

Only exceedingly rare treasures that could significantly change one's path in life appeared as silver dots.

Gold dots represented opportunities that could overturn destiny itself.

For instance, Gu Yuan's escape from the demonic sect and entry into Azure Peak Dao Academy—a life-altering event—had shone silver with hints of gold.

Yet the stone liquid had shown this cave as a cyan opportunity verging on silver—something that should greatly impact his cultivation journey. How could it just be "Azure Crane Spirit Water"?

"Though valuable, Azure Crane Spirit Water isn't even the highest-grade spiritual water in Azure Peak Dao Academy. It can be bought in the market for a few hundred spirit stones with some patience—how could this be a near-silver opportunity?"

Cultivation resources were generally divided into four grades: supreme, superior, medium, and inferior. Spiritual waters for Divine Sense breakthroughs were no exception.

The Golden Peak Dao Academy's Core Formation true disciples received an exclusive supreme-grade spirit water—Golden Howl Spirit Water. 

After consuming it, the resulting divine sense became as sharp as a golden sword, fierce and unstoppable, capable of shattering ordinary cultivators' sea of consciousness with ease. Only true disciples were granted this privilege.

Next came superior-grade spirit waters like Azure Crane Spirit Water and Dark Marsh Spirit Water.

The "Lesser Heaven Spirit Water" Qiu Mingshan had used was an inferior medium-grade option—the standard for most Azure Peak disciples.

Gu Yuan wasn't dissatisfied with Azure Crane Spirit Water. It was already a substantial asset that would elevate his divine sense beyond ordinary disciples.

But at best, this should be cyan with faint silver traces—not nearly pure silver.

Something was missing.

Lost in thought, Gu Yuan surveyed the chamber again.

The stone liquid had pointed precisely to this spot.

Yet aside from the spirit water, nothing else remained.

Unless... the true treasure wasn't the water, but the jade cup or pillar itself?
