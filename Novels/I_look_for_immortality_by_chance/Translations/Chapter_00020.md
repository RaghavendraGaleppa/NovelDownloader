# Chapter 20: The Leaked News  

Before Gu Yuan could comprehend what was happening, his vision cleared, revealing a magnificent jade palace suspended in the void. Around it, rivers of stars flowed, and celestial bodies orbited like satellites, resembling a heavenly abode. The entire structure stood resplendent upon the starry expanse, radiant and dazzling beyond belief.  

"This is…"  

Gu Yuan was momentarily stunned, scarcely able to believe his eyes. Just moments ago, he had been on an island in Silver Moon Bay—how had he suddenly arrived in what seemed like a celestial palace?  

"Haha, is this your first time visiting the Heavenly Star Black Market, Senior Brother?"  

A cheerful voice sounded from beside him. Gu Yuan turned to see a luminous figure, seemingly woven from moonlight, floating toward him. Though he couldn’t discern any movement of lips, the voice reached him clearly.  

"Don’t panic, Senior Brother—look down at yourself!"  

The figure laughed heartily.  

Gu Yuan lowered his gaze and realized his own body had also transformed into a silhouette of moonlight, a hazy shadow drifting amidst the stars. His true appearance was entirely obscured, his cultivation level indiscernible, and even his voice altered. Only the storage pouch at his waist remained tangible.  

"This is the 'Illusory Star Seal' left behind by Elder Xuan at Silver Moon Bay, forming this 'Heavenly Star Black Market.'"  

"This place blends reality and illusion—a marvel beyond compare. Not only does it protect our anonymity, but it also allows for seamless trade. Truly extraordinary!"  

"Even I was utterly awestruck when I first came here."  

The figure gazed at the celestial palace in the distance, admiration evident in his tone.  

Then, with another laugh, he added, "Though it’s almost a shame—despite Elder Xuan’s grand creation, all we ever trade here are crude, mundane goods. It feels like a slight to this divine palace!"  

With that, he led the way, floating ahead. In the blink of an eye, they arrived inside the palace.  

Golden tiles of glazed jade paved the floors, while massive stars hovered overhead, creating an opulent and breathtaking sight. Yet, the atmosphere was anything but serene.  

Moonlit figures filled the space, their voices rising in a cacophony of haggling and curses.  

"Fifty-year-old Emerald Serpent hide, with pristine Dao patterns—twenty spirit stones at the very least!"  

"Bullshit! That serpent was barely forty years old, and one of the Dao patterns is missing! Ten stones, take it or leave it!"  

"Deal!"  

"Damn it! You swindling bastard!"  

---  

As soon as Gu Yuan stepped into the palace, he was met with a chorus of crude insults.  

"Haha, don’t mind them, Senior Brother. Since no one knows each other’s identities here, people tend to be… unrestrained. Pay it no heed."  

The figure who had guided Gu Yuan chuckled and explained.  

"No worries. And thank you for your guidance earlier," Gu Yuan replied with a polite bow.  

"You’re too kind, Senior Brother. So, what brings you here today? Looking to sell something or make a purchase? I’m quite familiar with this place—perhaps I can point you in the right direction."  

The figure seemed genuinely eager to help.  

"To be honest, I’m seeking a second-grade Spirit Gathering Array Disk, and I’d also like to exchange some spirit stones."  

Given the mystical nature of this place and its connection to a Golden Core elder, Gu Yuan saw no reason to conceal his intentions.  

"A second-grade array disk? Is Senior Brother preparing for a major breakthrough?"  

Though the figure’s expression remained hidden, his voice carried a hint of excitement.  

But he quickly caught himself and refrained from further inquiry, instead guiding Gu Yuan westward through the palace.  

"My apologies for prying. Come with me—I know someone who has such an array disk."  

---  

Gu Yuan was surprised to find that the palace housed over a hundred moonlit figures—nearly as many as the bustling market outside. It was a stark reminder of the profound influence of the Azure Peak Dao Academy.  

"Senior Brother, big business! Another Senior Brother is looking to buy a second-grade Spirit Gathering Array Disk!"  

As they arrived at a jade platform, Gu Yuan’s guide called out enthusiastically.  

"Oh? Bring him here!"  

The figure behind the platform, equally indistinct, waved them over eagerly.  

Nearby, others turned their heads, but since identities were concealed, they soon lost interest.  

---  

Meanwhile, on Jade Forest Island…  

The island was abuzz with activity as countless cultivators arrived to celebrate the first anniversary of Lan Tianming’s newborn son.  

Though the Lan family had declined over the years, Lan Tianming himself was a prodigy—already at the late Foundation Establishment stage with hopes of reaching Golden Core. His marriage into the Lin family, another prominent lineage of the Dao Academy with three generations of Foundation Establishment cultivators, had elevated their status to near-Golden Core levels.  

Naturally, many sought to curry favor.  

The Lin family, with their sprawling influence built over centuries, ensured the festivities were grand and lively.  

Amid the jubilant atmosphere, only Lan Tianlu stood silent, fists clenched.  

---  

"If… if not for that damned brat, all of this would have been mine!"  

"Without him, I’d already be consuming top-grade spiritual water, breaking through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement, mastering secret seals, and contending for one of the Ten Great Disciple positions!"  

"That brat robbed me of my future!"  

"And Gu Yuan—Gu Yuan!"  

"How dare he win the favor of a Golden Core elder?!"  

Rage boiled within Lan Tianlu, but he dared not show it, forcing himself to sip his wine quietly.  

Just then, a conversation from a nearby banquet reached his ears.  

"Elder Hu’s female disciple’s remains have been returned and buried in the mountain!"  

"What?! Is that true?"  

"Indeed. Elder Hu’s avatar returned from beyond the academy recently. I saw the tombstone myself when I visited Green Fox Mountain—the remains were definitely recovered."  

"Who found them? Did Elder Hu do it herself? She once vowed that whoever recovered the remains would receive a Golden Core elder’s favor!"  

"Just some lucky kid from a minor sect. Elder Hu merely recommended him for admission."  

"Oh? Just a recommendation, not taking him as a disciple?"  

"Of course not. Elder Hu doesn’t accept male disciples, let alone one with only five spiritual apertures. If she had, the noble families would’ve swarmed him with marriage proposals—yet there’s been no movement at all."  

Lan Tianlu whipped his head toward the speakers—two elderly men from the Golden Core Feng family, known for their extensive connections despite their modest cultivation.  

He had planned to gather information at the banquet, but fate had delivered it to him sooner than expected.  

"So it’s true!"  

"A mere opportunist, stealing my destiny!"  

"Gu Yuan… I’ll kill you!"  

"I’ll kill you!"  

His murderous intent surged like a tidal wave, nearly overwhelming him.  

Just then, a delicate maid approached and bowed.  

"Young Master Lu, the mistress says you’ve reached the fourth level of Qi Refinement and will soon break through. She has prepared a portion of high-grade spiritual water for your cultivation."  

"Please take it and return to your residence to focus on your training."  

Lan Tianlu glanced at the water and recognized it instantly—Silverfish Spiritual Water.  

The weakest of high-grade spiritual waters. It granted a five-zhang spiritual sense, agile as a fish’s tail flick.  

But compared to the Azure Crane Spiritual Water, it was laughable.  

And the Spirit Dragon Heavenly Water? Not even worth mentioning.  

"I demand to see Second Uncle!" Lan Tianlu said coldly.  

"The master is in seclusion and cannot receive guests. The mistress insists you return to your residence immediately."
