## Chapter 18: Zhengyang Jin

It had been half a year since Li Zhi'ming arrived at Qixuan Gate. He had received a letter from home, written by his father through an old scholar in town. However, Li Zhi'ming was still illiterate, and although Han Li could read, the classical language used in the letter was difficult for him to understand.

The two eventually sought out the help of Mo Daren, the medical doctor, who explained the contents of the letter to them. Li Zhi'ming couldn't help but feel a pang of envy towards him, as he had someone to write to him, whereas Li Zhi'ming only had his family. He hadn't received any letters from them, and wondered if they had forgotten about him.

Li Zhi'ming had been sending three silver coins every month to his family, along with a message that he was safe and sound. However, his longing for home grew stronger with each passing day. His dream of becoming an immortal, which had once been so vivid, had begun to fade.

The story of the little fat boy from Dongxiang who had joined Xuan Guangzong had long been forgotten by Li Zhi'ming. He had begun to accept his fate, as the old scholar had advised, and was now focused on making the most of his life.

At Qixuan Gate, most people had white life grids, which was still much better than those in the village. However, Li Zhi'ming had yet to see a single green life grid. Everyone had various martial arts skills, but their life grids were mostly white or black.

Li Zhi'ming had spent the past half year exploring Qixuan Gate and had gained a good understanding of its inner workings. The sect primarily practiced "Qixuan Gong" and had over a dozen high-level martial arts. Over the years, the sect had grown, and its traditions had become more complex.

Qixuan Gate was divided into nine halls, each with its own unique martial arts. The disciples were first trained in martial arts and then learned "Zhengyang Jin" before being assigned to one of the nine halls as they grew older.

Those who excelled could become "True Disciples," but there were only about two hundred such disciples among the tens of thousands of Qixuan Gate disciples. They enjoyed a life of luxury, with no need to worry about anything except practicing martial arts.

The Pharmaceutical Valley was a special place within Qixuan Gate, where injured disciples were sent for treatment by Mo Daren. Li Zhi'ming had spent most of his time there, learning from Mo Daren.

As he walked through the bamboo forest, Li Zhi'ming heard the news that Liu Zhi had died. A fellow villager and childhood friend, Liu Zhi had passed away after falling from a mountain. Li Zhi'ming felt a pang of sadness, and his thoughts turned to Liu Zhi's parents, who probably didn't even know about their son's death.

Li Zhi'ming decided to ask Mo Daren to write a letter to Liu Zhi's parents, informing them of his passing. He then turned his attention to his own life at Qixuan Gate. He had been there for two years, and while he had made some progress, it was limited.

His life grid was still white, with skills such as farming, tailoring, blacksmithing, and pharmacology. He had also copied Daniu's Zhengyang Jin, but it was only at level 2. Li Zhi'ming couldn't help but feel a sense of stagnation, wondering when he would be able to make real progress.

Daniu, now ten years old, had grown tall and sturdy. He was practicing martial arts, and Li Zhi'ming watched him with a mix of admiration and envy. Daniu had given up crying, and his expression was now calm and determined.

The two friends sat together, and Daniu shared the news of Liu Zhi's death. Li Zhi'ming listened quietly, feeling a sense of loss. He then turned to Daniu and said that he would ask Mo Daren to write a letter to Liu Zhi's parents.

As they talked, Li Zhi'ming realized that their lives had changed significantly since they arrived at Qixuan Gate. They were now receiving a steady income, and their families back home were benefiting from it. However, Li Zhi'ming couldn't shake off the feeling that he was meant for something more.
