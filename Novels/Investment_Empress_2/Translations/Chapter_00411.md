# Chapter 411: Will She Return? The Ice Cube Refines the Heavenly Phoenix Domain!

The heavy coffin, under the reinforcement of Li Mo’s Little World power, was finally shaken.

Although the speed of movement was not fast, it was steadily and unwaveringly being pried open inch by inch.

Yun Mengxian was still in a state of confusion. Having been sealed here for so many years, even with two brains, she could not have imagined that this pair of young man and woman—one was not a native of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, and the other,明明 already possessing the meaning of "Her," had actually... fallen for a mortal heart!

"Once upon a time, even the Eighth Realm would bow and scrape before me. Do you think you can make me fall into silence again?!"

The boiling of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain grew more intense. An existence within it seemed to be forcibly changing its shape. One by one, dark hands pierced through the light, seemingly trying to reach out from within.

This was not Yun Mengxian breaking through her shackles. It was more like a person trapped in a cage reaching their hands out to the outside.

Those ink-black hands suddenly elongated, sweeping toward Li Mo, who was moving the coffin, as if trying to pull him into the cage together.

However, a cold figure wreathed in burning phoenix feathers stood before him at this moment.

"The power of all living beings has actually turned you into such a thing."

Ying Bing let out a soft sigh.

The divine sword, Moon of Yin, appeared in her palm. The sword light blurred her frost-snow-like face, making her figure seem to blend into the shadows of the moonlight.

Without any warning, a long hand was severed, clean and decisive.

But more long hands followed.

She was like a spirit in the shadows of time, her figure fast as a fleeting light and a passing shadow, yet appearing elegant and tranquil.

*Swish, swish, swish—*

One bizarre long hand after another was cut down, falling into the Crystal Palace and turning into drifting ashes.

*Boom—*

Suddenly, a heavy muffled sound rang out, and the entire Crystal Palace shook three times.

In mid-air, the expression of 'Qin Yuzhi' twisted slightly.

That was the sound of the coffin landing.

The figure lying inside had a face identical to the 'Qin Yuzhi' in mid-air.

"So she's still breathing."

Li Mo reached out to check the other party's breath.

It seemed that some strong practitioners would place themselves in coffins made of special materials to sleep within, waiting for the arrival of a grand era. So Qin Yuzhi's physical body looked as if she were merely asleep.

The Eye of Destiny swept over her.

**[Name: Qin Yuzhi]**
**[Age: 35 (6640)]**
**[Bone: Udaya Dream Bone.]**
**[Realm: Early Profound Profundity (Formerly Half-Step to the通天 Realm).]**
**[Destiny: Gold]**
**[Evaluation: The last Demon Summoning Sect Master of the Yun Meng Hall. After sensing the awakening of the Yun Meng Ancestor God within her body, she presided over the construction of the Yun Meng Palace. She originally intended to let her consciousness escape into the Heavenly Phoenix Domain, but coincidentally, Yun Mengxian's consciousness awakened, and a struggle for control ensued.**
**In the end, the Heavenly Phoenix Domain was split in two during the struggle. Half of it was burned by her using her own 'Dream Dao' to form a cage, imprisoning Yun Mengxian's consciousness, while she and her physical body were sealed together inside the coffin to suppress it.]**
**[Recent Encounter: Sleeping, dreaming that she is playing Mahjong.]**

"Li Mo, wake her up!"

Ying Bing's crisp voice rang out.

Reality is the end of dreams. After all, Yun Mengxian has not completely replaced Qin Yuzhi yet.

"Wake up!"

Li Mo grabbed her collar and shook her violently.

Her brain matter was almost shaken into a paste, yet this Demon Summoning Sect Master slept as soundly as a dead pig.

*Papapa!*

The crisp sound of slaps.

Tian Miao: "....."

Bro, you are really hitting her.

Extreme times call for extreme measures. It is perfectly reasonable for the Hammer Little Tyrant to say later that he has slapped the face of the Demon Summoning Sect's ancestor.

Qin Yuzhi's cheeks were slapped red, even slightly swollen, but she still showed no signs of waking up.

"Hm?"

Li Mo's peripheral vision noticed that a corner of the coffin seemed to have a square block placed on it, with a red 'Zhong' character written on it.

Mahjong?

Genius Li Mo had a flash of inspiration and leaned close to her ear to say:

"Sect Master, your 'Eighteen Arhats' is about to win."

"....."

Qin Yuzhi's eyelids trembled, and the corners of her mouth curled up.

"But sorry... I'm stealing the win!" Li Mo shouted loudly.

"!"

Qin Yuzhi sat up abruptly as if she had been resurrected, her body springing up suddenly.

She opened her eyes, fear giving way to confusion.

"Don't... don't..."

"My Eighteen Arhats!"

The moment she woke up, the figure of 'Qin Yuzhi' in mid-air began to dissipate.

The Heavenly Phoenix Domain also instantly froze, stopping its distortion and boiling.

But before completely vanishing, 'Qin Yuzhi' stared fixedly at the Ice Cube holding the Moon of Yin, resembling a goddess under the moon. She looked at Li Mo again and suddenly laughed:

"Hahaha... If She, who once said that the heavens are unkind and the Great Dao is unpredictable, wakes up... and finds out that she has fallen for a mortal heart, I wonder how wonderful her expression would be?"

"Among our Nine Heavens, she could withstand the other eight single-handedly."

"She will wake up one day."

Li Mo stood up abruptly; he had a bad premonition.

What is Yun Mengxian going to do?!

The next second.

'Qin Yuzhi', before vanishing, suddenly caused the Heavenly Phoenix Domain to plummet downwards!

That magnificent myriad of phenomena钻入钻入 into Ying Bing's brow.

Her divine markings, the increasingly brilliant moon patterns, suddenly bloomed.

Ten thousand paths of divine light washed over her layer by layer.

Ying Bing seemed to have become the center of the world, sacred and cold, like the only one in heaven and earth.

....

Outside the palace.

The rolling phenomena made the Crystal Palace emit a dazzling light, like a newborn sun rising. The entire underground palace was shaking.

"What is happening?"

The forces of the Demon Summoning Sect and the Great Yu Dynasty were already watching the area. Although they were at daggers drawn, they maintained a certain restraint. Whether the divine object in the Crystal Palace was a legacy or a treasure, they hadn't seen the main character yet, and there were unknown variables. It wasn't worth fighting to the death over it yet.

"The divine object in the Crystal Palace has chosen its master?"

Tan Zhuyin gripped his own palm so hard that blood was drawn, dripping drop by drop from between his fingers. He had paid such a huge price for this, even acknowledging a big brother-in-law for it. Now, had he made a wedding gown for someone else?

"Alas, if only my big brother, the immortal, were here." Luo Yexian sighed and muttered this, not knowing how many times.

Opposite them.

"The phenomena here share the same origin as the Heavenly City Realm..." The gray-haired old man, whom Jiang Yu called the Imperial Grand Uncle, flashed a sharp glint in his eyes. He commanded the 'Thunder Tribulation' Dao and had the ability to forcefully break open the Crystal Palace. He hadn't used his full power only because he was afraid of destroying the divine object inside.

"According to the Imperial Grand Uncle, who obtained the inheritance?"

Jiang Yu stood with his hands behind his back, his moon-white scholar's robe fluttering.

"The girl is more likely."

The Imperial Grand Uncle chuckled:

"Your Highness's Inner Scene is supreme under heaven. If what is inside is truly the missing part of the Heavenly City Realm..."

"No matter who got it, we just need to keep them here."

.....

Meanwhile.

Inside the Crystal Palace.

Li Mo stared blankly at the Ice Cube before him, who made the four words 'Guya Goddess' a concrete reality, making people feel self-conscious and inferior.

A prompt sounded in his ear:

**[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Ying Bing', allowing her to obtain half of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain.]**
**[You have an investment feedback waiting to be claimed.]**
