# Chapter 47: Reporting to the Sect  

"A disciple from Five Elements Peak? What brings you here?"  

After rowing their small boat for quite some time, Jiang Li and Yin Qiu spotted a figure in white robes planting Yin-Yang Bamboo stalks into the water. As they slowed down and approached, they realized it was a wooden puppet with a sorrowful expression painted on its face.  

Upon seeing them, the puppet wiped away nonexistent sweat from its brow in a remarkably human-like gesture before speaking.  

Recognizing the familiar puppet and voice, Jiang Li's face lit up—he had run into an acquaintance.  

"Elder Weng Sanqi, this disciple is Jiang Li. Senior Brother Yin Qiu was kind enough to escort me here."  

The puppet scratched its head, seemingly puzzled.  

"Jiang Li... That name sounds familiar..."  

Jiang Li: (¯¨̯¯̥̥) *So much for being an acquaintance.*  

"Elder, I'm the dual-spiritual root disciple you once gave guidance to," Jiang Li reminded him tactfully.  

"Ah, right, right! Now I remember! There was indeed a Jiang Li. Did you come alone on a mission? No elders leading you?"  

Elder Weng Sanqi was likely deep in his cups again, his thoughts sluggish.  

"Never mind, never mind. I'm short on hands here—come over quickly."  

"Yin Qiu, lad, thank you for looking after one of our Hidden Scripture Valley disciples. Next time I see your martial uncle, I'll put in a good word for you."  

The puppet waved dismissively, politely hinting for Yin Qiu to leave. Yin Qiu took the hint without the slightest displeasure.  

"Elder Weng is too kind. Yin Qiu takes his leave."  

With that, Yin Qiu tossed the bamboo pole to Jiang Li, then unsheathed his flying sword, Chixiao. The graceful swordsman stepped onto the blade, hands clasped behind his back, and glided over the water's surface back the way they had come, leaving only a parting remark:  

"Junior Brother Jiang Li, we'll spar another day~"  

That effortless elegance...  

*A flying sword cleaving through the wind, its edge reaching the heavens!*  

*Now* this was proper immortal cultivation!  

Meanwhile, without Yin Qiu stabilizing the boat, Jiang Li immediately began swaying unsteadily, flailing the thick-tipped bamboo pole like a balancing rod.  

Had Elder Weng Sanqi not taken pity and steadied the boat with his puppet, Jiang Li would have taken another involuntary dip in the river for a fish spa session.  

"Speak. Now that he's gone, what were you trying to signal me about earlier?"  

See? Who said Elder Weng Sanqi was muddled from drink? The man might be portly, but his mind was sharp as ever.  

"Elder, we've made a major discovery!"  

Jiang Li spoke with utmost seriousness, succinctly recounting the matter of the two thousand children with spiritual roots.  

---

"You're saying *all* two thousand of those children tested positive for spiritual roots?"  

Elder Weng Sanqi's expression grew grave.  

Two thousand spiritual root bearers—that was equivalent to three or four Ascension Assembly recruitment cycles, enough to swell the outer sect's ranks by a quarter.  

For a sect as young as Hidden Scripture Valley, barely three centuries old, this was an exceptional windfall.  

But that wasn't the crux of the matter.  

The real question was: *Why* did an entire group of children all possess spiritual roots?  

Was there a connection to their comatose state?  

Could there be some method to artificially bestow spiritual roots upon mortals?  

*No, impossible!* The notion was too audacious.  

Elder Weng Sanqi reflexively dismissed the idea. Throughout history, countless cultivators and mortals had attempted to defy heaven's will and forge spiritual roots—all had failed without exception.  

Even if such a feat were possible, it would be vanishingly rare, never occurring on such a massive scale!  

But even setting that aside... even if this phenomenon was merely a peculiar condition that exclusively affected those with spiritual roots, understanding it would allow Hidden Scripture Valley to conduct mass spiritual root testing without relying on external help.  

Imagine the advantage—with this method, the sect could effortlessly scoop up vast numbers of disciples across the Great Heavy Mountain Region.  

Given time, once this new generation matured, Hidden Scripture Valley would undoubtedly rise as the region's premier immortal sect!  

From this perspective, the affairs of Yinnan Kingdom's capital now took precedence over the Golden Core Corpse Demon plaguing these waters.  

"Elder, seven other outer sect disciples are still in the capital, working to keep this information from leaking."  

"But their strength is limited. With rogue cultivators flocking to the city due to the demonic outbreak, I fear they won't hold out much longer."  

"Returning to the sect to report would take too long, so I came downstream to seek your aid!"  

Though unspoken, Jiang Li's expression clearly conveyed: *This disciple has risked life and limb for this mission—don't forget my contributions, Elder!*  

"You've done well! I'll notify the sect immediately. Your rewards won't be lacking—come with me for now."  

A seasoned veteran like Weng Sanqi easily read Jiang Li's thoughts. But since the disciple had not only rendered service but delivered the credit straight into his hands, what harm was there in granting some rewards?  

---

The sorrowful puppet pressed a hand against the boat.  

Jiang Li glimpsed an almost imperceptibly thin thread attaching to the vessel.  

An instant later, an immense force yanked the boat forward, sending it hurtling toward the riverbank at several times its previous speed.  

Even gripping the chain railings couldn't stabilize Jiang Li—he crouched low, nearly hugging the deck to avoid being thrown off.  

*BANG!*  

Two minutes later, the slender, shuttle-shaped boat shot onto the shore, skidding dozens of meters before screeching to a halt beneath a makeshift canopy.  

Beneath the canopy sat a short, gray-haired cultivator with ruddy cheeks, speaking into a communication spirit stone.  

None other than Elder Weng Sanqi of the Mystic Gate Hall.  

Jiang Li waited silently as the elder concluded his transmission.  

"Jiang Li, come here. Repeat everything you know—leave nothing out."  

Elder Weng passed him the spirit stone.  

As Jiang Li grasped it, a stern voice spoke directly into his ear:  

"A sect team is already en route. Now, recount everything you've witnessed—omit *nothing*."  

The voice carried an implicit threat far worse than anything Jiang Li could imagine.  

Clearing his throat, Jiang Li delivered a strictly factual account—the withered yellow vegetation, the rogue cultivators who had attacked them in the city—avoiding personal speculation.  

The cause of the vegetation's decay eluded him, but the sect's investigation would likely uncover the truth.  

As for those rogue cultivators... well, those who dared such boldness would reap what they sowed.  

"Good. Report immediately if you recall anything else. Remain with Elder Weng for now."  

The connection severed abruptly.  

Jiang Li didn't know who had been on the other end, but Elder Weng's deferential attitude made one thing clear—this was someone far higher in the sect hierarchy.
