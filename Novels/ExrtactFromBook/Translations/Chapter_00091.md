# Chapter 89: Metal-Devouring Honey  

Seeing Wubing submit, Han wasted no more words.  

He flew to Wubing's side and slashed a sword aura fiercely into the ground beneath the panda.  

With a thunderous boom, sand and stones flew everywhere as a massive trench split the earth open.  

The [Earth's Grasp] death trap that had ensnared Wubing was completely torn apart by Han!  

Peering into the enormous trench, one could see all sorts of strange metallic minerals inside. These minerals possessed varying magical properties, and when combined, they formed the powerful magnetic field that had trapped Wubing.  

Amid the violent upheaval, Wubing was left covered in dust but finally freed.  

The moment the pulling force weakened, it immediately scrambled forward dozens of meters, putting ample distance between itself and the [Earth's Grasp] death trap.  

It shook its body to rid itself of the dirt, then trotted obediently to Han's side.  

"Thank you, Great One, for pulling me out. Otherwise, I'd have been stuck there for years."  

"I'll take you to the hive of those bees—there's something amazing there!"  

Wubing was quite sensible, not letting its newfound freedom go to its head.  

The slash that had shattered the [Earth's Grasp] had made Wubing fully aware of Han's strength. This human cultivator, whose power was unfathomable, was undoubtedly a formidable force.  

Wubing's innate ability, [Nose of the Divine], was never suited for combat, making it the weakest fighter among its kin.  

Faced with such a powerful human cultivator, it had no choice but to obey.  

Han landed atop the panda's head, settling comfortably into its thick fur, then patted Wubing's large skull. Immediately, the panda sprinted in the direction its nose had detected!  

Given Han's current physique, the panda's coarse fur didn't bother him in the slightest—lying in it was actually quite comfortable.  

At full speed, the second-tier [Iron-Eating Beast] was incredibly fast. With its magic enhancing its movements, each leap covered over a thousand meters.  

In just an hour, it could traverse thousands of miles!  

As Wubing charged ahead, Han asked another question:  

"Wubing, your nose seems quite sharp. Can you still smell my scent?"  

"Great One, you carry a faint fragrance, likely from the healing elixir you consumed. Now that you've absorbed it, the scent has weakened. If not for my exceptional sense of smell, I wouldn't have noticed it at all."  

Han nodded. As he had thought, his [Breath-Concealing Art] was still effective—it wouldn't fail to mask the aura of the [Nectar].  

Come to think of it, this wasn't the first time Wubing had gotten into trouble because of its nose.  

Its extraordinary sense of smell often led it to the scent of rare treasures. Greedy by nature, it couldn't resist investigating, but its lack of strength meant it was frequently beaten back, left battered and bruised.  

It relied entirely on its thick hide to endure the beatings.  

Truthfully, Wubing didn't have a bad impression of the cultivator on its back. Not only was he immensely powerful, but he also didn't seem to mind its gluttonous and lazy demeanor.  

As the weakest fighter among the [Iron-Eating Beasts], Wubing had suffered defeat after defeat over the years, its confidence thoroughly crushed. That was how it had developed its current attitude, making it generally unpopular in the Reed Continent.  

Little did it know, in Han's eyes, this was exactly how a panda should behave.  

If it had been stubborn and unyielding, Han would have found it unnatural.  

Before long, the duo spotted an enormous metallic beehive in the distance.  

Built against a mountainside, the hive stood over a thousand meters tall.  

Its surface was riddled with countless holes, deep and dark, with massive [Metal-Devouring Bees] constantly flying in and out.  

Han observed carefully—there were at least a hundred of the giant bees remaining.  

A colony of [Metal-Devouring Bees] typically consisted of a second-tier queen leading over two hundred first-tier giant bees.  

These insectoid demons were numerous, incredibly fast in flight, and venomous, making them extremely difficult to deal with. A swarm of a hundred first-tier bees could easily overwhelm a second-tier opponent.  

Even ordinary second-tier cultivators would avoid such a hive.  

Wubing stopped far away—it stood no chance against a hundred giant bees.  

Han didn't need the panda's help anyway. He could handle this swarm with ease.  

Rising from Wubing's head, he transformed into a streak of golden light and shot toward the hive.  

While still a hundred meters away, he unleashed a massive violet slash!  

This was the first time Han had wielded the full power of his [Trap Immortal Sword] since mastering it.  

He channeled his magic unrestrainedly, condensing it into a razor-sharp sword aura that cleaved downward through the enormous hive!  

The hive, forged from precious metals collected and refined by the [Metal-Devouring Bees], split apart like tofu, sliced cleanly in half!  

Unstoppable lightning magic surged through the hive, electrocuting every bee caught within its range.  

With just one strike, Han annihilated all his enemies!  

He was testing his newfound strength, gaining a clearer understanding of his capabilities.  

The bisected hive collapsed with a deafening crash.  

A few stray bees that had been flying around the hive survived the initial attack.  

Han showed no mercy, summoning the [Trap Immortal Sword] to dispatch them one by one with precise violet slashes.  

Soon, the area around the hive was littered with corpses.  

Hovering in the air, Han called out to Wubing in the distance. The bear happily scampered over.  

Without needing instructions, it began rummaging through the hive's wreckage.  

Despite being the weakest among its kind, Wubing was still a genuine second-tier demon beast. Its immense strength, sharp claws, and teeth allowed it to easily tear through the debris.  

Combined with its keen sense of smell, it ensured no treasure went unnoticed. Before long, it dragged several items to Han.  

The first was the corpse of the second-tier queen bee, its body five times larger than an ordinary [Metal-Devouring Bee].  

Having seen many second-tier demon beast carcasses, Han wasn't particularly impressed.  

But the other items piqued his interest.  

Among the treasures Wubing unearthed were several amber-like crystals—three in total. Two were as tall as a person, while the third was only the size of a millstone.  

These were the [Metal-Devouring Honey], a rare treasure produced deep within the hive by the second-tier [Metal-Devouring Queen Bee] over many years.  

These three items were the true prizes of Han's hunt.  

According to the *Divine Thunder Spiritual Compendium*, the honey secreted by the [Metal-Devouring Queen Bee], when refined with spiritual fire, could grant the consumer a [Poison Immunity] ability—strengthening the liver and spleen while warding off all toxins!
