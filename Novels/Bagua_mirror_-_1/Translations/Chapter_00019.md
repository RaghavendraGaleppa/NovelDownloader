# Chapter 19: The Yun Family

"Hmm, your son does have refined features, but what a pity his cultivation is so lacking. With a triple spiritual root aptitude, he shouldn't be stuck at the third level of Qi Refining. What's the reason for this?" remarked the cultivator surnamed Huo.

Sighing, Qin Hao replied, "I've investigated this matter for a long time, but still haven't found the cause." His tone carried obvious frustration.

Yet Qin Chong understood the situation perfectly. Initially, he had thought his stalled cultivation was due to his transmigration. It wasn't until the incident at Feiyun Pond, where the yin-yang fish merged with the Bagua Mirror, that he realized the mirror was likely the true culprit.

Though the Huo cultivator maintained a benevolent facade, Qin Chong detected a cold glint in his eyes—this man was no kind soul.

"Then let this Huo take a look," the cultivator said suddenly.

Qin Chong immediately felt a powerful surge of spiritual energy invade his body, probing every corner before converging on his dantian. Alarmed, his expression turned fearful.

His concern was the Bagua Mirror being discovered. Qin Hao, mistaking his son's reaction for shock, didn't intervene.

After a tense moment, the invasive energy withdrew without detecting the mirror. Qin Chong wiped the sweat from his brow with his sleeve, relieved to have escaped unscathed.

"Chong'er, you've just returned. You should rest," Qin Hao suggested.

"Yes, I'll take my leave. Farewell, Senior Huo." Qin Chong bowed before retreating to his courtyard.

Though a false alarm, the incident confirmed two things for Qin Chong: First, this Huo wouldn't leave without extracting some benefit. Second, Huo Yuanliang held no significant status in either the Canglong Valley or the Huo family.

The first conclusion came from observing Huo's behavior today. The second was evident from his stay in Pingyang City—after several days, no news had spread about the incident, proving Huo Yuanliang's insignificance.

Exhausted, Qin Chong collapsed into bed.

He slept until noon the next day. After washing up and preparing to go out, his younger brother Qin Peng burst in anxiously. "Elder Brother, Father wants to see you!"

"Father wants me?" Qin Chong frowned. After yesterday's encounter with Huo, what could be the matter now?

"Your future sister-in-law is here."

---

"Sister-in-law?" Only then did Qin Chong recall his long-arranged engagement—a childhood betrothal arranged by Qin Hao that he'd never paid much attention to.

A sinking feeling told him this wasn't a social visit.

"What does she want? I'm not of marriageable age yet."

"You'll find out when you get there," Qin Peng replied mysteriously.

As they walked to the main hall, the brothers chatted.

"Elder Brother, Xiao Fei has been acting strange lately. He's become distant, even avoiding you."

"Oh? How do you know?"

"Mother mentioned it. She's been acting odd these past few years too."

Qin Chong chuckled. "It's nothing. You're all growing up. You can't follow me around like children forever."

"But—"

"Focus on your cultivation. When your skills improve, you can venture out. Remember this: Never trust easily, and never reveal your true capabilities. Stay vigilant, or—"

Qin Chong's lengthy lecture left no room for interruption.

"Cough! You're starting to sound like Father," Qin Peng muttered, lowering his head.

"Whoever's words they are, they're for your good."

Qin Chong understood his brother's unspoken concerns but deliberately diverted the conversation to spare him further worry.

Upon reaching the hall, Qin Chong entered while Qin Peng lingered outside, curiously peeking in.

Inside sat Qin Hao and two guests—a father and daughter from the Yun family, a cultivation clan slightly more powerful than the Qins. Yun Qing, the family head, resembled Qin Hao in age but stood taller with scholarly features that contrasted with his stature.

His daughter, Yun Xue, Qin Chong's betrothed, was two years his senior at eighteen or nineteen. Already striking in appearance, she had reached the seventh level of Qi Refining—far surpassing Qin Chong's progress.

"Qin Chong pays respects to Uncle Yun and Fellow Daoist Yun." He bowed politely.

Yun Xue barely acknowledged him with a nod, her expression indifferent. After one brief glance, she ignored him completely.

"No need for formalities, Chong'er. You've grown since we last met," Yun Qing said warmly, though Qin Chong sensed tension in the air. Were they here to break the engagement? How cliché.

His suspicions proved correct—this outcome was inevitable in the cultivation world where strength dictated everything. His stagnant progress had made this day only a matter of time.

Qin Hao cleared his throat. "Chong'er, your Uncle Yun came to discuss your engagement. Given your... lack of progress, he wishes to dissolve the arrangement. We wanted your opinion."

Qin Chong feigned distress before replying, "I have no objections. Since you and Uncle Yun made the agreement, you should decide together."

He deliberately avoided taking responsibility, throwing the matter back to them. In truth, he knew they'd already reached a decision—his presence was merely a diplomatic formality to preserve relations between their families.

With that, Qin Chong addressed Yun Qing: "Nephew has urgent matters to attend to. I take my leave." He turned and exited without another word.

"That boy certainly has a temper," Yun Qing remarked awkwardly.

"Since Chong'er has no objections, we'll proceed as you suggested, Brother Yun. It wouldn't do to damage our families' friendship over this."

"Very well."

Yun Xue's expression darkened as she stared at the doorway Qin Chong had departed through. What thoughts lay behind her gaze remained unknown.
