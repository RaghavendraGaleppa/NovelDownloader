# Chapter 64: The Foe Arrives!

The Cloudsoar Heavenly Vessel descended.

In Twin Nines City, hundreds had already received the news and were waiting in anticipation.

"Welcome, First Seat Immortal!"  

The crowd bowed in unison, their voices booming like a mighty river, resounding through the heavens.  

Li Zhengjing stood aboard the Cloudsoar Heavenly Vessel, scanning the crowd below. Among them were over a hundred dressed in the robes of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.  

The majority, however, were soldiers from the Great Zhou border army, along with disciples of the Kunlun Immortal Sect, Buddhist monks, and many other cultivators in eclectic attire—men and women, young and old.  

"Rise."  

The First Seat of the Ancient Moon Peak appeared, clad in pristine white robes that stood out like the only light in the overcast sky.  

He stepped through the air, descending gracefully to the ground with his hands clasped behind his back.  

"Secure the Cloudsoar Heavenly Vessel and arrange accommodations. No welcoming feast is necessary tonight."  

With that, he strode forward without another word.  

Elders like Chen Xuan, who had come to take over the defense of Twin Nines City from the previous stationed elders, dispersed to their respective posts.  

The group of inner disciples from Ancient Moon Peak, primarily here for training, were assigned to separate lodgings.  

On the way, Li Zhengjing took the opportunity to ask Xie Guihai about Twin Nine City.  

"This place is barren and harsh, a land of bitter cold. Usually, only those like Elder Chen Xuan, who have been punished, are sent here," Xie Guihai explained in a low voice.  

"However, the sect's Public Affairs Hall offers generous rewards for defending Twin Nines City—three times the merit compared to assignments in the sect's other territories. That's why some elders and disciples willingly endure the hardship here, seeking advancement."  

Xie Guihai went on to explain the origins of Twin Nines City.  

Seventeen years ago, Mount Fengdu collapsed. Various factions joined forces to suppress the millions of demonic creatures that emerged, restoring peace to the mortal realm.  

The aftermath of the battle left the northern lands nearly devoid of life, with no grass growing and an enduring miasma of sinister energy that still lingered.  

To prevent the spread of this malevolent energy into the Great Zhou Dynasty's territory, the factions jointly established Twin Nines City as a boundary to block the encroaching darkness.  

The city was perpetually guarded by the Great Zhou border army, with the three major immortal sects, various Daoist sects, Buddhist temples, and others taking turns to assist in its defense.  

The Great Zhou Dynasty even issued bounties—monthly cultivation resources for those who assisted in guarding the city, grade-ranked spirit stones for a full year of service, and high-grade spirit pills for ten years.  

The rewards varied based on the cultivator's strength and contributions during their tenure.  

Many rogue cultivators, lacking proper guidance or resources, came here seeking the dynasty's rewards, hoping to carve out a path for themselves.  

"If the rewards for defending Twin Nines City are this generous, its purpose must extend beyond merely blocking the northern miasma," Li Zhengjing mused.  

"There must be some hidden danger here."  

Glancing around, he noticed the crude architecture, though covered in intricate arrays and runes.  

The entire city resembled a great dragon coiled upon the earth.  

"Rumor has it Twin Nines City is a single massive formation, inscribed with runes. If activated by a Human Immortal, it could become a world-shaking treasure."  

"Junior Brother Xie, your knowledge is impressive despite your modest cultivation," Li Zhengjing remarked approvingly.  

"I spent five years as a menial disciple and over a year as an outer disciple. I’ve been in the sect for more than six years—of course I’ve learned a thing or two," Xie Guihai said through gritted teeth. "Unlike you, who became a half-step True Disciple with golden-edged silver tokens in just half a year!"  

"Fair point."  

Li Zhengjing chuckled inwardly. *Junior Brother Xie is as knowledgeable as that boastful bird.*  

Xie Guihai fell silent and trudged ahead.  

The elder in charge of their reception was also from Ancient Moon Peak. He introduced himself as having been stationed in Twin Nines City for twelve years and was quite amiable.  

After registering their names, he allowed the disciples to choose their accommodations.  

At this moment, silence fell once more.  

All eyes turned to Li Zhengjing.  

Though his cultivation was only at the seventh layer of Inner Qi—not the highest among the disciples—he held a golden-edged silver token, granting him status equal to an inner elder.  

Moreover, he had slain the Southern Wasteland's Venom King Xin Xuan, a feat even the sect's chief true disciple, Lu Huaiyuan, and several elders had failed to accomplish. His reputation was at its peak.  

No one dared to speak before Li Zhengjing made his choice.  

"Nephew..."  

The elder glanced at the golden-edged token and smiled. "So it's you! I’ve heard of your deeds—slaying the Southern Wasteland's Venom King at the Inner Qi realm, bringing glory to the Central Plains, and earning the Hollow Gold Token. In truth, your status is no less than mine."  

He gestured graciously. "Nephew Li, please choose your quarters first."  

Li Zhengjing bowed slightly and addressed the other disciples. "In that case, I’ll accept without further courtesy."  

He selected the most spacious courtyard and settled in.  

Though the buildings in Twin Nines City were crude compared to the refined elegance of the sect or the luxury of the Cloudsoar Heavenly Vessel, they were more than adequate for Li Zhengjing.  

After resting for a while, he was about to release the Hanging Bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree from the Wutong Wooden Box, lest they suffocate inside.  

But just then, a figure in the corner of his eye startled him.  

He turned sharply to see none other than the First Seat of Ancient Moon Peak.  

"Twin Nines City is a colossal treasure in itself, capable of unimaginable power. Thus, no Human Immortal is stationed here," the First Seat said calmly.  

"My presence here is unknown to all."  

His expression remained indifferent as he continued, "Though Ghost Valley’s Divine Official has weakened over the past seventeen years by replacing his body parts, he remains a Human Immortal. Yet now, he seeks our sect's aid, hunted by forces at least at his level—perhaps even multiple Human Immortals."  

With that, the First Seat tossed an object toward Li Zhengjing.  

"Ghost Valley’s Divine Official will come to Twin Nines City seeking refuge. When you meet him, give him this as proof to board the Cloudsoar Heavenly Vessel."  

"Do not wait for my return. Once he has the token, command the vessel to depart immediately for the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect."  

He paused before adding, "Furthermore, those hunting him are backed by formidable forces. Twin Nines City is a melting pot of factions—even some within our sect may have defected to their side. Be cautious when seeking Ghost Valley’s Divine Official."  

Li Zhengjing examined the object in his hand and frowned. "Why entrust such a dangerous task to me?"  

"You know Ghost Valley’s Divine Official, and he knows you. You are the most suitable candidate," the First Seat replied. "And though you are merely at the Inner Qi realm, you slew the Venom King Xin Xuan. Your strength rivals that of a True Qi cultivator—enough to protect yourself."  

Before Li Zhengjing could respond, the First Seat soared into the sky, vanishing in a streak of light.  

"If you survive this, I shall grant you a great opportunity."  

Left alone, Li Zhengjing fell silent and consulted the golden page in his mind.  

His fate remained unchanged—he would still die from the backlash of the Great Derivation Void-Transforming Sword Qi, only to be annihilated by the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord.  

In other words, Twin Nines City posed no mortal threat to him.  

Relieved, he spat in disdain. *Damn it all! So I’m still doomed either way?*  

With a smack, he opened the Wutong Wooden Box and released the Hanging Bird.  

"Fly up and search for Ghost Valley’s Divine Official."  

Though unfamiliar with the area, the bird obeyed without question, soaring into the sky to scan the city.  

Within minutes, it returned.  

"Master, someone approaches—but he’s far better-looking than Ghost Valley’s Divine Official. Probably not him."  

"Not him?" Li Zhengjing blinked. "Then who is it?"  

"Not sure. He’s masked, carrying a sword, and moving fast."  

"Could he be here to kill me? Where is he now?"  

The bird glanced toward the entrance.  

"He’s… at the door."  

**BOOM!**  

The courtyard gates shattered.  

A sword light flashed straight for Li Zhengjing!
