# Chapter 51: The Ice Cube's Missing Person Notice (Part 2)

“Help?”

Li Mo was a bit confused.

For someone with Bing Tuozi’s personality to actually ask someone else for help, something must be up.

Ying Bing sat at the stone table, habitually pouring tea. Her plain, elegant face held a hint of confusion. She cleared her throat:

“Come a little closer.”

Li Mo: “.....”

Why does this feel so strange?

Asking for help sounds like a superior giving a lecture.

Who knows how the Ice Cube developed such an imposing aura? Well, it must be the innate extraordinary nature of the Heaven’s Chosen Daughter.

“What is it that requires such a grand setup?”

“You don’t have many things you care about.”

Li Mo sat opposite her and casually picked up a cup to take a sip.

He didn’t notice that he was using the same cup the Ice Cube had just drunk from.

“Will the sect mission you accepted take you to Ziyang Prefecture City?”

Ying Bing’s eyes flickered slightly, as if she hadn’t noticed.

“I haven’t accepted a mission yet.”

“However, I do plan to find some tasks in Ziyang Prefecture City to complete.”

Li Mo hugged the back of his head with his hands and smiled:

“Since coming to Ziyang Prefecture, I haven’t properly toured around. I suppose I want to abuse my public power for a bit of personal gain.”

“This trip won’t be very busy. If you have any trivial matters, feel free to speak up.”

Completing missions is secondary.

Sect contribution points are somewhat optional for him. Accepting a simple task to pass the time will suffice.

“I want you to help me find someone.”

“She should currently... be a beggar.”

Lost in memory, the frost on Ying Bing’s face seemed to melt a little.

At that time, she hadn’t been able to join the Qingyuan Sect.

She could only take shelter in an abandoned residence within Ziyang Prefecture City. It was there that she met Jiang Chulong, who was also homeless.

In this life, she opened her meridians and revealed her talent thanks to Li Mo’s help.

In her previous life, if she hadn’t mutually helped Jiang Chulong, she wouldn’t have been able to open her meridians either.

She has now entered the Qingyuan Sect.

Without her, Jiang Chulong is all alone, and who knows how she will face those difficult situations...

“I want you to find her and arrange for her food, clothing, and shelter.”

Huh?

After hearing her words, Li Mo was stunned.

The Ice Cube is actually worrying about someone’s basic necessities?

Is this still the Ice Cube I know?

Could it be one of her relatives?

Her original county was ravaged by disaster beasts, and her relatives were supposedly all killed.

Perhaps she received news that she still has a single relative who has drifted to Ziyang Prefecture City?

That would make sense.

Li Mo naturally thought of this possibility.

So he said seriously:

“Rest assured, Ziyang Prefecture City isn’t small, but finding a person isn’t difficult.”

“If you remember the person's appearance and features, why don’t you draw them?”

As he spoke, he took out a brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.

Helping the Ice Cube, he is more than willing. As long as it’s related to the Ice Cube, the system’s feedback has never been lacking.

Besides, finding a relative, even without a reward, he is happy to help.

“Drawing...”

Ying Bing calmly took the brush.

After a little over an hour.

Li Mo looked at the ‘masterpiece’ on the table with a solemn expression.

“Ying Bing.”

“Hmm?”

“I’m asking, does anyone actually look like this?”

Looking at the portrait, a masterpiece of abstract art, Li Mo asked.

Let me put it this way.

You ask me to find someone, can the portrait be a bit realistic?

You’re doing abstract art. If I hadn’t seen a few of Picasso’s works in my past life, I wouldn’t even recognize this as a person.

---

“The features are very obvious.”

“A woman, big eyes, small lips.”

Ying Bing’s beautiful eyes averted to the side.

Li Mo: “....... Does she have any more intuitive characteristics?”

Ying Bing seemed to be recalling, and after a while, she said:

“There is.”

“She has a very terrifying wound on her chest, she speaks a bit stutteringly, and... if you wash her face clean, she is very pretty.”

“Uh... how pretty?”

“Compared to me, she has her own unique charm.”

“..... That is indeed the case.”

.....

Time waits for no one.

In the end, Li Mo finally summarized some specific information.

Better now than later.

He didn't dawdle and prepared to set out that very day.

Before leaving, he left a few days' worth of wine for his Master, to be supplied by Ying Bing on schedule.

After doing all this, he went to the Divine Weapon Peak.

.....

Afternoon.

A rather imposing carriage drove down the mountain.

Incense was burning inside the carriage, and the tea in the bowl swirled without spilling a drop.

“Brother Li, why did you accept a mission to hunt down a notorious bandit?”

Mu Rongxiao looked over the portrait spread out on the table.

This portrait drawn by the External Affairs Hall was also quite blurry.

After all, there are no photos in this era.

If one cannot draw from a live model, it can only be based on verbal descriptions, and even then, different people describing the same person may have discrepancies.

“I needed to find someone anyway, so I thought I might as well do this too,” Li Mo said casually.

The notorious bandit Cui Peng, at the Inner Qi Condensation Realm, was severely injured by an outer sect steward ten days ago.

He is proficient in hard body training, skilled with swordplay, and has dozens of blood debts on his back.

For other disciples at the Qi and Blood Realm, even if Cui Peng is injured, he is still a tough nut to crack.

But for Li Mo...

A decent sparring partner, that’s all.

He still hasn't had a real fight with anyone yet...

“Since Brother Li has accepted the mission, even if I have to turn Ziyang Prefecture City upside down, I will definitely find this person,” Mu Rongxiao said with a grin, scratching the back of his head.

Li Mo couldn’t help but laugh.

It feels like after learning the Golden Bell Shield, Mu Rongxiao has become a bit more simple and honest?

“By the way, Brother Li, besides Cui Peng, who else are you looking for?”

“A little beggar...”

Inside the carriage, Mu Rongxiao held a brush, seriously recording every word Li Mo said, appearing extremely attentive.

He planned to ask his grandfather for help as soon as he returned home.

In terms of information, the Mu Rong family is quite well-connected, and Li Mo trusts this.

Unconsciously.

The carriage entered the city, directly entering the inner city where the buildings were much more luxurious than those in the outer city.

“The Mu Rong Mansion.”

Li Mo looked up and saw the gilded plaque. The Mu Rong Mansion was quite imposing even within the inner city.

“Young Master, Young Master Li.”

The steward seemed to have been informed beforehand and greeted them with a smile.

“Brother Li, please, make yourself at home.”

Mu Rongxiao relaxed as soon as he returned home.

Walking through the corridor and garden, Li Mo looked around with interest.

It seemed much larger than his hometown's residence and had a more aristocratic feel, very meticulously crafted.

“Xiao’er.”

Entering the main hall, they saw two old men sitting at a large table full of delicacies, drinking tea. The one wearing a crimson brocade robe waved to Mu Rongxiao.

The other old man in a purple robe, with half-black and half-white hair, had his gaze fixed on Li Mo.

Then, his eyes shifted to the long sword at Li Mo’s waist.

“This must be True Disciple Li.”

“Truly a handsome man, a hero among the young.”

The old man in crimson brocade stood up with a smile to greet them:

“Just now, I was drinking tea with the Prefecture Lord. Upon learning that True Disciple Li was coming, he insisted on staying and drinking several more cups of my Cloud Mist Eyebrows tea.”
