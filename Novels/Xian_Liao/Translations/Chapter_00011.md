# Chapter 11: Fists  

After completing the Tiger Exercise, Zhou Qing lay on a long stone bench in the courtyard, letting the cool breeze wash over his body. The familiar warmth within him dispersed into his limbs as usual.  

This growing sense of stability and strength filled Zhou Qing's heart with contentment.  

He focused his attention on the "Health Master" panel:  

**Remaining Lifespan:** 32 years  
**Five Animal Exercises (Basic Proficiency)**  
**Tiger Exercise (Novice)**  
**Black Tiger Plucks the Heart (Proficient)**  
**Flicking Finger Technique (Rudimentary)**  

"Another year has been added to my lifespan during my practice of the Five Animal Exercises, but it's not yet time to celebrate. This only makes up for the years I lost due to my body's previous deficiencies."  

Though he told himself not to be overly pleased, Zhou Qing couldn't help but smile slightly.  

Since his transmigration, the immense pressure to survive had driven him to constantly push himself. The confusion, fear, and other negative emotions had gradually dissipated in the process. Now, even without modern conveniences like phones or the internet, Zhou Qing felt his life was far more meaningful than in his previous existence.  

In his past life, despite graduating from a decent university, his average background meant he was doomed to a relentless struggle for a house, car, insurance, loans, and more—working himself to the bone just to survive.  

That was the fate of an ordinary person.  

Even if he achieved some success, it would only serve as a slightly better starting point for the next generation—a fragile foundation that could crumble under the slightest pressure.  

And as an ordinary person, he might not even live long enough to retire, given how retirement ages kept being pushed back. Even if he made it to his seventies or eighties, what enjoyment could a frail, sickly body bring?  

Now, every effort he made was for his own health. Through studying and the imperial examinations, he could attain fame and fortune, securing resources to further nourish his body.  

In truth, while the average lifespan in ancient times was shorter, those who lived comfortably—provided they didn’t court disaster—could live just as long as modern people.  

"Let’s set a small goal: I’ll live another five hundred years."  

Thinking about the path ahead, Zhou Qing felt a deep sense of peace and stability.  

---  

The next morning, Zhou Qing woke up early.  

After each training session, the mysterious warmth circulating through his body ensured that he never suffered from the usual soreness of physical exertion by the next day. Moreover, the nourishing effects of the Five Animal Exercises had naturally invigorated his vitality.  

Stretching lazily, he went to the courtyard and compared his height against the mark he’d made on the mulberry tree the day before. To his delight, he had grown slightly taller.  

Growing taller was a joyous thing, though it also came with minor inconveniences.  

---  

With his changing physique, he needed new clothes—and clothes weren’t cheap.  

In some impoverished villages, families might share a single decent outfit, taking turns wearing it when going out.  

*"Yesterday I entered the city, returned with tears soaking my sleeves. Those clad in silks and satins were not the ones who raised the silkworms."*  

*"Though no field lies fallow across the land, farmers still starve to death."*  

Zhou Qing silently recited these verses, sighing lightly.  

*When poor, one cultivates virtue alone; when prosperous, one extends benevolence to others.*  

For now, he was still poor. But through teaching at the village school, he could at least give his students a chance to change their destinies.  

In this era, the value of education was immense.  

After breakfast and washing up, he checked on the drying Five-Fragrance Pills—thankfully, no insects had gotten to them. Relieved, he packed his book satchel.  

Besides teaching materials like brushes, ink, and rough paper, the bottom of the satchel was weighted with stones for resistance training. As his body grew stronger, he planned to add leg weights and sandbags for constant conditioning.  

The journey from his home to the village school in Hu Village was about four or five *li*.  

Using the Deer Exercise’s techniques to train his legs, he arrived at the school covered in sweat. Dropping the satchel, he collapsed onto a chair.  

Since this wasn’t a formal Five Animal Exercises session, the warmth generated was much weaker. Still, a faint heat spread through his legs from the rudimentary Deer Exercise and the Health Master’s effects, quickly dispelling fatigue and adding a sense of renewed strength.  

Before long, the first arrival wasn’t a student—but the village elder of Hu Village and an unfamiliar man in a satin robe, clearly someone of status.  

"Scholar Zhou, this is Village Head Zhang of our district."  

After exchanging greetings, Village Head Zhang—who had been busy collecting summer taxes in neighboring villages—studied Zhou Qing closely. His first impression was of youth.  

A young *anshou* (top candidate in the county exams) with a bright future, especially one personally selected by Education Commissioner Lu, was someone to be treated with respect.  

"Commissioner Lu will be visiting the school this morning to assess its standards. This concerns the educational achievements of Jiangzhou City and is no small matter. If we can leave a favorable impression, both the district and Hu Village will be deeply grateful," Zhang said solemnly.  

Had this been an ordinary tutor, his tone would have been far more commanding. But given Zhou Qing’s background, his demeanor was markedly different.  

"I’ll do my best," Zhou Qing replied.  

Zhang cupped his hands slightly. "Then we leave it to you, Scholar Zhou."  

---  

During the lesson, Zhou Qing remained calm, teaching basic literacy as usual. The students, however, were visibly nervous, having been warned of the day’s importance.  

Yet, seeing their teacher’s composure, they gradually settled down.  

*"The Way of the Great Learning lies in manifesting virtue, in renewing the people, and in resting in the highest good..."*  

After finishing the basic lessons, Zhou Qing recited the opening passage of *The Great Learning*—the same text that had once caused his soul to leave his body during meditation.  

But that had been his own issue, unrelated to the classic itself.  

The classics remained the classics.  

As the students repeated the passage, their agitation faded, replaced by tranquility.  

Shortly before noon, Zhang returned.  

"Commissioner Lu is nearing the village entrance. Scholar Zhou, please prepare."  

Zhou Qing dismissed the class, straightened his robes, and led the students to the school’s entrance to welcome the commissioner.  

The formation had been rehearsed days prior. Though there was some initial confusion, Zhou Qing’s steady guidance soon had everyone lined up by height and age.  

In the distance, dust rose as the sound of gongs announced the procession.  

*Boom! Boom! Boom!*  

Ten strikes of the gong.  

In the imperial system, the number of gong strikes signaled an official’s rank.  

A seventh-rank county magistrate warranted seven strikes; a fifth-rank prefect or governor, nine; a regional overseer like a pacification commissioner or transport commissioner, eleven.  

Since Education Commissioner Lu oversaw the preliminary exams for several prefectures and his office was based in Jiangzhou, his status was slightly higher than a prefect’s—hence the ten strikes.  

This was somewhat irregular. Normally, education commissioners, responsible for academic records, were considered equal in rank to prefects.  

But commissioners were often *jinshi* graduates of the second rank or higher, some even having served in the Hanlin Academy. Their scholarly prestige set them apart from ordinary officials.  

The ten gong strikes were partly flattery but also reflected the commissioner’s elite status.  

As the procession neared, villagers knelt by the roadside, avoiding the official palanquin.  

The strict hierarchy was on full display.  

Zhou Qing’s students also knelt, awed into silence by the commissioner’s imposing presence.  

As a *xiucai* (scholar), Zhou Qing was exempt from kneeling before officials of the third rank or below. The highest regional official, the pacification commissioner, held only a third-rank position.  

Commissioner Lu stepped out of his palanquin.  

Zhang and the county magistrate approached to pay their respects.  

The magistrate, from the nearby county of Qingshui, had accompanied the commissioner.  

After the usual formalities—claims of simplicity despite the fanfare—village elders, local leaders, and gentry clustered around the commissioner, their usual arrogance replaced by fawning deference.  

The commissioner held power over the scholarly registries of several prefectures, presiding over exams and even revoking *xiucai* status. His influence was undeniable.  

After exchanging pleasantries, Commissioner Lu turned to Zhou Qing with a kindly expression.  

"Zhou Qing, have the children rise."  

Among scholars, *xiucai* were called "old friends," and child scholars "young friends." Normally, Lu would have addressed Zhou Qing as "old friend."  

But as the *anshou* he had personally selected, Zhou Qing was treated with familiarity—a mark of favor.  

Commissioner Lu then drew Zhou Qing to his side, introducing him to the magistrate and others.  

To the local power brokers, Zhou Qing’s status as Jiangzhou’s young *anshou* was now firmly imprinted in their minds.  

Unless conflicts arose, they would treat him with courtesy henceforth.  

Of course, if their interests were truly threatened, these local elites—practically petty kings in their domains—could make even a prefect’s life difficult.  

After all, only they could ensure smooth tax collection and labor conscription.  

A well-organized peasant revolt could cost a county magistrate his hat—or worse.  

But Zhou Qing, with his youth and connections, had the potential to establish his family as a local power in time.  

Commissioner Lu then quizzed the students briefly before turning his attention to Zhou Qing, testing his knowledge of the classics.  

The *Four Books and Five Classics* were essential for the exams, but their sheer volume and complexity made mastery a decade-long endeavor—hence the saying, *"Ten years of bitter study by cold window light."*  

Yet Zhou Qing answered every question with ease, impressing the commissioner.  

"Young as you are, your grasp of the classics is remarkable. No wonder your eight-legged essays were so polished," Lu praised.  

The eight-legged essay tested classical understanding. Memorization was the foundation; true mastery required deeper interpretation—ideally with a mentor’s guidance.  

Zhou Qing’s proficiency at his age hinted at extraordinary potential.  

But early success could be a double-edged sword.  

After his praise, Lu grew serious.  

"The classics contain the sages’ subtle wisdom. Though you’ve memorized them, true understanding demands years of effort. Do not grow complacent or rush for fame."  

Zhou Qing nodded in agreement.  

The ensuing banquet was a standard affair. Zhou Qing played his part with polite restraint.  

Before departing, Commissioner Lu reminded him of their next meeting at the prefectural school’s opening. Beyond that, no further instructions were given.  

But Lu’s evident favor had made an impression on the local officials.  

---  

On the way home, Zhou Qing’s satchel no longer held stones but modest gifts from Zhang and others—several strings of copper coins and assorted items worth a tidy sum.  

This didn’t even account for formal occasions like weddings, where gifts would be far more substantial.  

Just yesterday, he’d been cautiously researching the Five-Fragrance Pills as a potential income source. Now, Commissioner Lu’s visit had yielded unexpected gains.  

"Still, this is mostly due to Lu’s influence. While it’s a windfall, it won’t last long if I pour it all into training."  

As his body developed and his training intensified, the costs would only grow.  

For now, he remained cautious due to his previously weakened constitution. Yet the expenses were already mounting.  

Cultivation seemed a bottomless pit.  

A steady income was essential. The Five-Fragrance Pills venture would have to continue.  

---  

As dusk fell, the mulberry tree’s shadow stretched long in the sunset.  

Approaching his gate, Zhou Qing heard footsteps. Glancing sideways, he saw a woman emerging from the tree’s shadow, swaying toward him.  

The dappled light and an eerie, sudden gust sent a shiver down his spine, raising goosebumps.  

*"A ghost?"*  

Without thinking, Zhou Qing lashed out with *Black Tiger Plucks the Heart*.  

In his haste, the strike missed her chest, landing on her face instead. Though at less than a third of its usual force, it was enough to knock her unconscious.  

*"Damn—she’s alive."*  

Kneeling, he checked her pulse. She was still breathing.  

---  

Back at the Lin family estate, the maidservant Chunxiang—her face swollen like a pig’s head—sobbed to her mistress, her words slurred:  

"Miss... I didn’t... even speak... Scholar Zhou... so unreasonable... just punched me... knocked me out..."
