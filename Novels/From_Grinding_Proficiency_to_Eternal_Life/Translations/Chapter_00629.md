# Chapter 629: Divine Core

Only the ground within a zhang radius around Xu Yunfan remained pristine and untouched, free from any dust.

"So much for being a deity," Xu Yunfan said coldly.

Dilis was about to retort, her lips parting as the syllables formed in her throat.

Then Xu Yunfan moved.

It was neither teleportation nor the tearing of space.

That single step followed the suddenly visible, twisted, and entangled threads of cause and effect—a manifestation of pure causality, a principle invisible, inaudible, and untouchable to ordinary beings.

In Dilis's rapidly contracting pupils, Xu Yunfan's figure seemed to ignore the barriers of the divine realm entirely. Like a pebble dropped into a pond, it rippled through the nearly imperceptible laws, and his form vanished before her eyes.

The next instant.

Xu Yunfan's foot landed upon the ground of Dilis's divine realm.

This so-called divine realm was not solid earth but a foundation of faith woven from the devout thoughts of countless believers and fused with faint divine power. His arrival was like a boulder crashing into the center of a calm lake.

The space of the divine realm groaned under the unbearable strain. Cracks, visible to the naked eye, spread instantly from the point of his descent, resembling a shattered glass vessel.

"Outsider!" Dilis cried out in horror.

She was the deity of this world, and this place was her absolute domain. Yet, someone had forcibly invaded it. In her shock and fury, she didn't even have time to ponder how he had breached it, only feeling the rage and terror of having her core territory violated.

The immense power of faith accumulated over a thousand years converged in her hand, transforming into a dazzling Spear of Judgment. The tip of the spear was wreathed in a sacred flame capable of melting gold and purifying all things.

The laws of the divine realm empowered her. Countless profound runes etched themselves onto the spear's shaft, drawing upon the strength of the entire realm. With an unstoppable might, it tore through space and thrust straight for Xu Yunfan's brow.

Its speed far surpassed that of lightning. Its power was enough to make mountains and rivers lose their color.

Xu Yunfan didn't even fully turn around.

Facing a blow capable of piercing through mountains, he simply raised his right hand. The motion was not fast, but clear to see, carrying a languid casualness. He spread his five fingers, his palm facing forward.

There was no earth-shattering collision, no blinding storm of energy.

The Spear of Judgment, which contained Dilis's entire divine power and the will of her realm, halted just an inch from Xu Yunfan's palm, as if it had struck an invisible wall.

*Hum!*

The sacred flame at the spear's tip, upon touching the invisible barrier, was instantly extinguished as if doused with ice water, its light fading and dispersing. The runes flowing along the spear shaft flickered wildly, attempting to draw more divine power, but they were completely snuffed out in the next moment.

In the end, it vanished entirely before Xu Yunfan's eyes, without even stirring a breeze. Xu Yunfan's hand remained outstretched, not a single wrinkle on his sleeve.

The angry, twisted expression on Dilis's face froze, replaced by a fear that pierced to the bone.

Xu Yunfan's gaze fell upon her. It was no longer the look of one observing an enemy, but more like examining an object. In his eyes, this goddess was rather weak—an excellent entry point. It was worth the time he had spent finding this place.

His outstretched hand did not withdraw. Instead, his five fingers clenched into a虚空 grip.

The space of the divine realm let out a groan of unbearable strain.

Dilis felt an indescribable, terrifying power descend upon her instantly. She was pinned in place by invisible shackles, unable to even move her eyes. She was like a painted statue instantly cast in the amber of space, with nothing but terror frozen deep within her gaze.

This was his innate supernatural ability, the Northern Purple Star Suppressing Evil Primordial Qi. It could suppress evil, and it could suppress people. Naturally, it could easily control his opponent.

Xu Yunfan took a step, appearing right before her, so close he could see the finest patterns on her divine robe. His gaze did not linger on her beautiful yet terrified face. Instead, it pierced directly through her divine body, locking onto the core of her being.

The Divine Core that carried the source of her power and her very existence.

A materialized Divine Core?

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. This was somewhat interesting.

His right index finger pointed toward Dilis's brow.

The instant his fingertip touched her skin, Dilis could clearly feel that Xu Yunfan's finger ignored the obstruction of flesh and bone. Like picking something from a bag, it went straight into the core region of her spiritual origin.

Like the sharpest scalpel, it precisely pierced toward that Divine Core suspended at her core, radiating a soft divine light.

The Divine Core was seized by an invisible force, enveloped, and forcibly torn from Dilis's soul. In the agony of her soul nearly shattering, Dilis could sense her Divine Core being snatched away by the other party.

Beyond the horror, there was more disbelief.

This had never happened before. Even in divine wars, when deities fought to obtain each other's Divine Cores, they had to kill the other and destroy their Divine Core first.

Suspended three inches from Xu Yunfan's fingertip was the stripped Divine Core, no larger than a fingernail. Having separated from Dilis's divine body, its light appeared dim and unstable, trembling slightly and emitting a faint hum.

Xu Yunfan's gaze was fixed intently on the Divine Core. His divine sense slowly probed into it while casually setting up an inspection formation. As the formation activated, countless tiny runes seemed to be born and extinguished within it.

Time seemed to stagnate within the divine realm.

Every second of analysis was an eternal purgatory for Dilis. She could clearly feel the other's divine sense freely dismantling and analyzing her most core secrets, while she was like a fish on a chopping block, unable to even destroy her own Divine Core.

Xu Yunfan's brows, in the midst of focused deduction, furrowed slightly. At first, there was a hint of inquiry into the essence of a deity, but this inquiry quickly turned into understanding.

The analysis was complete.

"Nothing special," Xu Yunfan said, shaking his head slightly. This so-called Divine Core was a projection of this world's heaven and earth and could not be taken away. To him, it was practically useless.

He looked at Dilis, who stood motionless, and shook his head again.

"Initial Foundation Establishment, the realm of a newly formed Dao Foundation. Truly weak. And you dare call yourself a deity?"

His fingertip moved slightly, and the stripped Divine Core was flicked away by him. It turned into a stream of light and flew back into Dilis's brow, returning to the depths of her soul.

The pain of being stripped away vanished instantly, but the humiliation and fear of being completely seen through and dissected like a lab specimen remained, lingering in her heart.

Xu Yunfan withdrew his hand, his gaze sweeping over Dilis's pale, stiff face, as if confirming the label on an item for the last time.

"This Dao Foundation wasn't cultivated by your own hard work."

"It is a gift from the laws of the Heavenly Dao of the Aetira World. If you were to die, this foundation would simply return to the heavens."

In other words, the Heavenly Dao could withdraw this kind of Divine Core authority at any time. For a cultivator, this was truly an unacceptable cultivation system.
