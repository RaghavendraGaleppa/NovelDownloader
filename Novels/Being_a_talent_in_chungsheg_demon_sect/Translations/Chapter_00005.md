## Chapter 5: I've Noted This Grudge

"Senior Brother Liu? He's come knocking?!"

Hearing the voice from outside his cave dwelling, Lu Yang's pupils constricted abruptly, and his face instantly darkened to an extreme degree. Not only did he not respond, but he also suppressed his aura.

"...Junior Brother?"

The voice came again, but Lu Yang still didn't respond. Although he had no proof, he was already certain that the 'Innate Dao Scroll' he was cultivating had problematic content!

"I still paid the price for my lack of experience; I didn't even suspect it before. The Joyful Union Hall and Heaven-Mending Peak are closely related. The cultivation method's content should also be related to Yin-Yang harmony, but the Innate Dao Scroll has nothing to do with it. He tricked me! But why would he want to harm me? Although the Primeval Sage Sect is a demonic sect, it still has rules. Private duels between official disciples are strictly forbidden. Once discovered..."

Thinking of this, Lu Yang suddenly slapped his forehead. "How could I have fallen for the demonic sect's trickery! 'Once discovered, once discovered'... If not discovered, it doesn't count as a private duel?"

The more Lu Yang thought, the uglier his expression became. In the end, it was due to force of habit. Liu Xin's every word and action before had fulfilled the duty of an introductory disciple. Besides introducing the inner sect's situation, he also seemed dedicated and unreserved in detailing the inner disciples' benefits—magic treasures, pills, spirit beasts, and so on. He didn't withhold anything, especially at the Treasure Refining Hall, where he even instructed the deacon there to give him the best...

It turns out it was all an illusion! Everything before was just to set up the final step of handing him the 'Innate Dao Scroll,' making him drop his guard and completely trust his good intentions!

"Now that I think about it, he might have even harbored thoughts of private appropriation. After all, if he killed me, all the magic artifacts, pills, and spirit beasts I obtained would naturally become his... No wonder he specifically said he wanted the best!"

Beast!

Just then, a sound came from outside the cave dwelling again. The next second, with a "crack" sound, the array formation of Lu Yang's cave dwelling burst open with a roar, and the main door was forcefully torn apart by a sword light!

The door swung open, and Liu Xin, robes fluttering, strolled in. Upon seeing Lu Yang, Liu Xin's face revealed a joyous, almost bountiful expression. He nodded in satisfaction: "Junior Brother is indeed a talent..."

*Boom!*

Before Liu Xin could finish speaking, Lu Yang directly exploded! Overwhelming Innate True Qi, wrapping around the magical artifact Bone Jade Sword, finally transformed into a sharp sword light, slashing towards Liu Xin with an unstoppable momentum.

However, the next second, the sword light abruptly halted.

"...A dying struggle."

Liu Xin neither dodged nor evaded. He merely formed a hand seal, and Lu Yang's body instantly lost control, as if it had become someone else's puppet!

"This Innate Dao Scroll is a good thing," Liu Xin couldn't help but burst into laughter upon seeing this scene. "The cultivator transforms their physical body and primordial spirit into a wisp of Innate Qi. It can be used in medicine, for refining treasures, and even to increase cultivation. With this rare treasure, I believe reaching the late-stage Qi Refinement is within reach! By helping me break through, Junior Brother, you can consider your death well-placed."

As his words fell, Liu Xin immediately began to change his hand seals. Lu Yang instantly found his consciousness gradually dissipating, as if it was being forcibly erased!

At this moment, Lu Yang had a sudden realization: "This is the second half of the Innate Dao Scroll! The first half is a trap for others to cultivate, and the second half is the true method. It's designed so that once others cultivate the first half, they become a wedding dress for oneself!"

Rather than saying it was a cultivation method, it was more like a refining art. However, it wasn't about refining objects with objects, but refining people with people—making people refine themselves. The true cultivator hid in the shadows, saving both trouble and effort. Named a Dao Scroll, it was in fact a demonic art!

"You're good, I'll give you this life."

Thinking of this, Lu Yang simply stopped resisting, letting his consciousness dissipate. After the initial shock and anger, he even regained a calm and composed demeanor.

"A fall into a pit, a gain in your wit. You can deceive me once, but I have countless more chances. I've noted this grudge!"

The next second, Lu Yang's consciousness plunged into darkness. In the void, only the rustling sound of pages turning remained.

**[Your consciousness was refined by Liu Xin, and you completely transformed into a wisp of Innate True Qi. You are dead.]**

**[Current remaining pages of the Hundred Lives Book: 98]**

**[Restarting a new life, you can choose one of the following gains from your previous life:**
**One: Treasure.**
**Two: Cultivation.**
**Three: Lifespan.**
**Four: Abandon all gains and randomly awaken a talent based on your previous life's experiences.]**

"Those whose names are called, step forward."

A familiar voice came from the platform. Lu Yang gritted his teeth to control his emotions, not looking up, but focusing his thoughts on the panel before him. Treasure, cultivation, lifespan.

If he could, Lu Yang naturally wanted to choose cultivation, but he was worried about being found out and then being unable to explain where his cultivation came from. As for lifespan, he skipped it directly.

"Can I only choose treasure...?" Lu Yang frowned deeply. Speaking of treasures, he only had the Bone Jade Sword, which was barely presentable. But without cultivation, he couldn't activate a magical artifact, no matter how good it was.

Just then, Lu Yang's gaze suddenly froze. Because just now, the Hundred Lives Book suddenly gave him a feedback.

"This... can also count as a treasure?" Lu Yang was first astonished, then showed a thoughtful expression, and finally gritted his teeth and made a decision: Choose One, retain one treasure obtained in the previous life.

The next second, an anomaly suddenly occurred! Without alarming anyone, all anomalies were confined within Lu Yang's dantian. Its source was, astonishingly, a wisp of misty, surging white Qi.

Innate True Qi!

The Innate True Qi that Lu Yang had refined in his previous life by transforming his internal organs, flesh, tendons, and bones, was actually considered a treasure, and now he had redeemed it!

"Unbelievable..." Lu Yang lowered his eyelids, concealing the surprise in his eyes. This was because he found that not only could he manipulate this ball of Innate True Qi with the ease of moving his own arm, but he could even cast the spells from his previous life through it!

"Under normal circumstances, this should be impossible. Because to manipulate Innate True Qi, one must use the secret art from the second half. But I am different, because this wisp of Innate True Qi *is* me!" The two were originally one entity. For Lu Yang, it was equivalent to having an additional Qi Refinement First Layer clone. "Moreover, before I died in my previous life, I heard Liu Xin say that this Innate True Qi, when used in medicine, could assist in breaking through realms... This wisp of True Qi will be of great use in the future!"

After consolidating his gains, Lu Yang began his actions in this life. First, he was still assigned to the Joyful Union Hall. Then, he counter-killed Yu Suzhen. However, this time, to avoid attracting attention, Lu Yang did not use Senior Sister Yu's vitality to break through to the Qi Refinement Realm. Instead, he fed it all to the Innate True Qi.

"In this life, I'm going to lie low and not be reckless!"

Sure enough, Liu Xin, who was waiting outside the door, saw that Lu Yang had not broken through after plundering Yu Suzhen's cultivation and immediately lost interest in Lu Yang.

Following this, Lu Yang waited patiently. Ten-plus days later, a disciple named "Qin Yu" from the Joyful Union Hall broke through. Lu Yang saw Liu Xin rush over upon hearing the news and excitedly take Qin Yu away.

A few more days passed, and Liu Xin announced his seclusion. The senior brother responsible for introductory disciples was also replaced. But Lu Yang still didn't show his face.

"God knows what kind of person this new senior brother is. What if he's also like Liu Xin... Hmm, it's better if I don't stick my neck out. To be safe, I'll wait another month."

In this way, another half-month passed. It wasn't until another outer sect disciple broke through to Qi Refinement and entered the inner sect, and was safe and sound, that Lu Yang chose to break through. With the blessing of Innate True Qi, Lu Yang didn't actually need to cultivate demonic arts to break through. However, to cover his tracks, he still casually found a few outer sect disciples to cultivate.

This time, the official disciple responsible for introducing him was much more perfunctory, completely lacking Liu Xin's enthusiasm, and even showing a hint of disdain in his expression.

"This is the Scripture Pavilion." After receiving the benefits, the person led him to a pavilion and casually said, "Take this token and go in. Exchange whatever cultivation methods you want with your contribution points." After speaking, the person simply turned and walked away.

However, upon seeing this, Lu Yang felt doubly relieved. Small figures had their own advantages; the fact that the person didn't put him in their eyes actually suited him perfectly.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang turned again to look at the distant Heaven-Mending Peak.

"Liu Xin... Hmph!"

A few days ago, Liu Xin emerged from seclusion, officially breaking through to the late-stage Qi Refinement, and even became a direct disciple of the Heaven-Mending Peak Master. He was currently enjoying a period of great success.

Lu Yang snorted coldly, withdrew his gaze, and strode into the Scripture Pavilion. Although he harbored thoughts of revenge, he was currently too weak and powerless. Therefore, the most pressing matter was to cultivate diligently. Everything else could wait until he became strong.

"A gentleman's revenge, ten years is not too late. A temporary expedient, no need to rush!"
