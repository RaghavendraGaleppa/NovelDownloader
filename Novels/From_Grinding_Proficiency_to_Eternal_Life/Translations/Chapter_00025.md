# Chapter 25: Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer

Looking at Xu Yunfan extending his palm before him, Li Haomiao furrowed his brows in disgust, his fingers still stained with blood.

"What about the fighting techniques for the Copper Body Art?"

The Copper Body Art was not merely a hardening skill; upon reaching its great completion, he naturally knew it was missing a portion of hammer techniques.

Li Haomiao came to a realization and glanced at the surroundings, nodding. "There is indeed a hammer technique I haven't taught you yet. There was no place for it at the time. We'll find a spot, and I'll teach you."

After Fang Mushan executed the last soldier who could no longer endure and tried to flee, he sighed, holding his blood-stained spear. He bent down and closed the eyes of the soldier before him, whose eyes were wide with terror.

"You were good soldiers. It's a pity you became pawns discarded by others. Don't blame me."

Fang Mushan's expression was slightly desolate. Looking around, the twenty-nine elite soldiers lay scattered on the ground, the earth already dyed red by their blood.

After composing himself, he looked at Xu Yunfan with a complex expression. The scene of him and Yang Gan exchanging blows, fist meeting flesh, had been incredibly impactful.

Both practiced hardening styles, attacking with extreme ferocity, with almost no thought for defense other than protecting their vitals. If they were to charge into an enemy formation on the battlefield clad in armor and wielding weapons, the outcome was easy to predict.

"No wonder my father used to say that those who practice hardening styles are mostly fierce generals in the military."

Seeing Fang Mushan staring at him, Xu Yunfan felt a bit helpless.

"A big man like you, can you stop staring at me for so long?"

Fang Mushan snorted coldly, then twisted the shaft of his spear, his expression solemn.

"I want to fight you."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, looking at Fang Mushan in surprise. This guy was arrogant and looked down on others from a high perch; it was unexpected for him to say such a thing.

Li Haomiao said from the side, "Don't belittle yourself. You have already perfected your skin tempering and are a martial artist. That Fang kid is only at the initial stage of muscle tempering."

The implication was clear: to the current Xu Yunfan, Fang Mushan was nothing more than a small matter.

Fang Mushan snorted coldly and swept a glance at Li Haomiao.

"You're a cripple, so I won't bicker with you. I want to see just how powerful a True Blood practitioner is."

Li Haomiao's face turned gloomy as he goaded Xu Yunfan.

"Go on, smash his mouth for me. Then I'll teach you a heaven-shaking divine art, enough to maximize the use of your True Blood. If the secret powers of the world were to manifest in this era, you might even be able to pursue the Extreme Path."

Xu Yunfan had no intention of being used as a pawn.

"Alright, it's not safe to stay here. We can fight when we're safe. There might be pursuers. If a master of the Outer Three Unions jumps out, we're all done for."

The group fell silent.

After dealing with Yang Gan and his men, the two and a half men didn't stop. After gathering useful tools and weapons, they trudged another sixty li through the biting wind. Along the way, Xu Yunfan and Fang Mushan did their best to cover their tracks.

Throughout the journey, Li Haomiao whispered the complete method of the Copper Body Art.

The training method of the Copper Body Art had already been taught to Xu Yunfan completely; only the fighting techniques were unknown.

"The full name of the Copper Body Art is Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer. It is divided into the Red Forged Cloak Hammer and the Copper Body Art, a martial art that combines hardening and hammer techniques. In the Great Zhou's Imperial Archives, it is considered a fine upper-class martial art."

"The saying goes: The Red Forged dances, the Copper Body protects, the Cloak wards off enemies, the Hammer falls to startle the soul..."

Li Haomiao meticulously explained the fighting techniques of the Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer. Fang Mushan, walking ahead, had a strong sense of honor and deliberately moved further away, putting on a disdainful air.

*You have heard the complete explanation of the Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer. Your Copper Body Art has been transformed into the Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer.*

*Your martial art has been completed. You finally understand the previous contradictions and are suddenly enlightened. Your proficiency in the Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer has increased.*

*...*

After talking for a long time, Li Haomiao, who was on Xu Yunfan's back, exhaled. He used his remaining arm to untie a waterskin and took a sip before saying, "The body is as solid as cast copper, the hammer is as fierce as a red forge, the cloak unfolds its might, attack and defense are one. If you can perfect this hammer art, a golden skin state will naturally appear."

"It's fine if you can't memorize it all at once. We can go over it again later."

Xu Yunfan didn't reply. With the help of the attribute panel, he had already mastered this Red Forged Copper Body Cloak Hammer perfectly. He just lowered his head and pondered it deeply.

Although hardening skills are difficult to practice, upon reaching the great perfection of skin tempering, one can naturally touch upon the perfect Golden Skin state.

However, Li Haomiao didn't finish his sentence. Golden Skin Jade Veins, Scarlet Blood Silver Marrow, Yin-Yang Treasure Robe, and Zhouqi Circulation Qi. These four great realms, few in the world can break through, let alone in this era where the secret powers of the world are not manifest.

As dawn broke, they finally found a wind-sheltered cave, where they saw a hibernating bear and her two cubs.

Fang Mushan immediately thrust his spear and killed the entire family, his expression slightly excited. "These two big ones and one small one are enough for us to live comfortably for a few days."

After cleaning the cave, gathering firewood, washing the bear meat with snow, and roasting it over the campfire, Fang Mushan's gaze fell on Li Haomiao, who was habitually leaning in a corner, looking very leisurely.

"Prince Yan? Li Haomiao?"

Li Haomiao raised an eyebrow, a hint of a smile on his face, which, due to the three ferocious scars, looked extremely fierce.

"I didn't expect you to still recognize me. I remember when you were a toddler, I even held you."

Fang Mushan felt a bit uncomfortable, recalling the taunts he had made earlier, but then he asked impatiently.

"How is my father?"

Xu Yunfan, who was practicing the Cloak Hammer with a large saber nearby, couldn't help but prick up his ears upon hearing this.

Grand General Fang Wen, a title that sounded very grand. Although he didn't want to get involved in court affairs, he could still hear some gossip.

Li Haomiao comforted him, "Rest assured, your father is a pillar of the military. If something happened to him, that treacherous woman would absolutely not be able to hold her position稳稳坐住. At the very least, the generals at the border would be the first to object. Not to mention, besides your father, there are also Hu Lei, Long Yun, and Lei Wenfeng, a group of great generals. If that treacherous woman dared to move against your father, she wouldn't be able to keep her throne stable. She can only try to win him over. As for why you were in Ningguta..."

Xu Yunfan said casually, "It's probably also your father's expedient measure for the sake of the Great Zhou."

Li Haomiao, upon hearing this, praised, "I've underestimated you. I thought you wouldn't be able to think of these things."

Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered with this self-satisfied guy and turned to continue practicing the Cloak Hammer.

"Is it practiced like this?"

When Li Haomiao glanced over and was about to withdraw his gaze, his eyes froze, and his expression became one of astonishment.

He had only told Xu Yunfan this once, and he hadn't even demonstrated the fighting techniques.

How could Xu Yunfan execute it so perfectly?!

Li Haomiao was shaken inwardly but kept a calm face. He nodded slightly. "It seems you have quite the talent."

"Heh, it's more than just talent. If you were in Yujing..."
