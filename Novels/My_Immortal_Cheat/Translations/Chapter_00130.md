# Chapter 130: Zhou Changsheng

Zhou Tian had originally thought that once they reached his home ground, a super expert would directly suppress the Saint Devil, saving them a lot of trouble. However, he hadn't expected that the Saint Devil had already inquired and knew there were no experts capable of crushing him here, which was why he suggested coming. Although there were many at his level, once he activated his Saint Devil integrated state, even if he couldn't win, escaping would be no problem at all.

"Tian'er, why are you in the Saint Devil's hands?" The armored middle-aged man in the center spoke, his voice carrying a hint of surprise. This person had black hair, and some dao principles and patterns emerged on his forehead. Terrifying power overflowed from him. He wore azure-gold armor, appearing immensely powerful.

Zhou Tian was momentarily stunned. Tian'er? Was he calling me? He hadn't carefully observed the three people opposite him earlier. Now, looking at the armored middle-aged man in the center, there seemed to be a faint sense of familiarity. The armored man saw Zhou Tian's bewildered gaze and his face sank. "Zhou Yi, that brat, I don't know how he became a father. His son doesn't even recognize his own grandfather."

Zhou Tian couldn't help but be stunned. This middle-aged man was his grandfather? Was there such a coincidence? Although he was puzzled internally, he still respectfully called out, "Grandfather." They were all people of status; the other party certainly wouldn't deceive him on such a matter, otherwise, it wouldn't be Zhou Tian who lost face.

Hearing the address "Grandfather," the middle-aged man's expression softened considerably. He also understood that he had only appeared before Zhou Tian twice, and both times were when Zhou Tian was a child. It was understandable that Zhou Tian wouldn't immediately remember. He had only spoken that way just now because he felt a little embarrassed. At this moment, he nodded and said, "Don't worry, the Saint Devil wouldn't dare do anything to you. Otherwise, I'll blast him to bits." His tone was casual, as if discussing a trivial matter he didn't care about. He wasn't looking down on the Saint Devil; he genuinely believed what he said.

The Saint Devil smiled upon hearing this, not getting angry. "Zhou Changsheng, that might have been true before, but now, who can say?"

"I know, you've just figured out the method of fusion, but that alone isn't quite enough," Zhou Changsheng said. He had received news about the Saint Devil, and this time, he had proactively volunteered to return to Kyushu to hunt down the Saint Devil, considering it was his grandson. However, he hadn't expected such a significant accident, forcing him to temporarily put aside the pursuit of the Saint Devil.

"You can try," the Saint Devil said, his smile receding. He and Zhou Changsheng were figures from the same era, and Zhou Changsheng had suppressed him several times in the past.

"Brother Changsheng, the Saint Devil doesn't seem to be here for a fight. Let's hear what he has to say first." The person dressed in a daoist robe stepped forward to mediate.

"Xuan Zhenzi's consideration is indeed thorough. Zhou Changsheng, you really need to change your fiery temper," the Saint Devil nodded and said, simultaneously sending Zhou Tian over. He had been supporting Zhou Tian with his power all this time, which was a gesture of goodwill, as he wasn't here to cause trouble.

Invisible energy enveloped Zhou Tian. Zhou Changsheng's expression softened. Since the Saint Devil had made a gesture of goodwill, it wasn't appropriate for him to be aggressive.

"Haha, Saint Devil, don't say my consideration is thorough. My nephew was shaken by you and lost quite a bit of essence blood. If you can't explain it clearly, Brother Changsheng might not be the first to make a move," Xuan Zhenzi laughed heartily, though his words were far from polite. His eyes shone brightly, his black hair fluttered, and his skin gleamed like jade. This was an exceptionally powerful physique. The Saint Devil's eyes flickered; he was extremely familiar with this body, as the two had fought many battles in the past.

"I will naturally provide an explanation," the Saint Devil said calmly, showing no panic.

"Grandfather, the Saint Devil wants to become a retainer of our Zhou family," Zhou Tian whispered beside Zhou Changsheng. However, given the cultivation realms of the people present, they naturally heard every word clearly.

"Oh? It seems there's nothing for us here today," Xuan Zhenzi looked at the Saint Devil with a slight surprise, appearing to be in thought, but he didn't say much more.

"Xuan Zhenzi, this can be used as a healing medicine for that little fellow. Tell him to have a better attitude next time," the Saint Devil flicked out a dazzling golden pill. Instantly, a fragrant aroma permeated the air. The pill was about the size of a thumb, and something seemed to be moving on its surface.

"Then he's truly blessed in disguise," Xuan Zhenzi laughed, seeing that this pill was certainly no ordinary item, enough to offset the Saint Devil's previous action.

"Then I shall take my leave first," Xuan Zhenzi could tell that the Saint Devil had come directly for the Zhou family. Since the Saint Devil had paid the price for the earlier incident, he no longer wished to stay here and intended to depart.

"Then I'll also be leaving," the feathered-crowned figure said as well. He was from the Great Luo Academy and had heard about Zhou Tian causing them to lose significant face, but how could someone of his realm bother to dwell on such matters with a junior like Zhou Tian? Thus, he also bid farewell.

After the two of them left, Zhou Changsheng said to the Saint Devil, "Come with me. Being a retainer of my Zhou family isn't so easy."

The Saint Devil nodded and followed him forward.

This was the residence of Kyushu, where many cities stood, strategically arranged to form grand arrays, suppressing the four directions. Not only people from the major powers resided here, but also those who had passed through the Heavenly Pass to arrive, forming a trading hub. This was the center of the God-Forsaken Land, with many traces left from the ancient Divine Realm. In the wilderness, numerous ancient Sacred Spirits roamed, remnants left after powerful divine kingdoms were shattered. It also produced the most unique item of the God-Forsaken Land: divine cores.

The Zhou family's stronghold was in a city in the southeast. The three of them directly landed inside a building in the center of the city. As soon as they were seated, Zhou Changsheng unceremoniously said to the Saint Devil, "Saint Devil, the matter of you attacking my grandson is not yet concluded. Give me a reason to accept you." Zhou Changsheng exuded unparalleled dominance, his eyes fixed on the Saint Devil. Seated on the chair, he resembled a war god, his qi and blood surging, as if he would immediately take action if the Saint Devil's answer was not satisfactory.

Zhou Tian felt the overwhelming domineering aura.

The Saint Devil was completely unaffected, and calmly said, "Zhou Tian and I had a very pleasant conversation and decided to let bygones be bygones."

Zhou Tian's eye twitched. This person was even better at fabricating stories than he was. After a moment of thought, he spoke, "Grandfather, I have two friends in his hands. I reached an agreement with him that any grievances incurred by our Zhou family because of me would be dropped from now on..." Zhou Tian briefly explained the full story to Zhou Changsheng, hiding nothing. He felt it was better not to deceive Zhou Changsheng along with the Saint Devil, as Zhou Changsheng was his own kin. As for the lives of Zhou Musu and Ling Yu, he believed Zhou Changsheng would not disappoint him.
