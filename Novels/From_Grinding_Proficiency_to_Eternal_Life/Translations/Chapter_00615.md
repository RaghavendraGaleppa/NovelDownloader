# Chapter 615: Indeed, Not a Single One Who Can Achieve Foundation Establishment Is a Fool

However, he gripped the True Martial Sword tightly, his body like a steel nail driven into the earth. His bones creaked under the strain, yet he did not retreat a single step.

The Martial Dao Sky Eye operated frantically, analyzing the weakest link in the opponent's Platinum Sword Intent. A beast-like roar erupted from his throat.

"Break for me!!!"

Empowered by three layers of secret arts and divine abilities, the Rage-Slaughter Sword Intent surged toward the heavens.

The True Martial Sword, a magic treasure-grade sword artifact, could no longer withstand the impact of such violent energy. The fine purple arcs on its ancient blade were replaced by a crimson sword light, followed by a cracking sound as if it could bear no more, with cracks spreading like a spider's web.

The entire East Sea fell into dead silence under the collision of the two ultimate sword intents.

The unyielding, no-return path represented by the platinum line clashed head-on with the violent, rage-slaughter path symbolized by the crimson torrent. Space twisted and collapsed, light flickered in and out.

For a moment, a stalemate ensued, then a sound like tearing silk exploded!

The unyielding sword intent, representing Ye Yuan's lifelong comprehension of the sword path, was actually torn apart by Xu Yunfan. By mobilizing his Martial Dao blood and qi, the essence of the Hundred Desires Secret Art, and the Sword Dao of his clone, he unleashed the Rage-Slaughter Sword Intent.

The platinum line shattered inch by inch, and the residual sword qi surged back, tearing several bloody wounds through Ye Yuan's protective aura.

The elder of the Wansheng Sword Sect trembled violently, retreating three steps before stabilizing himself. The jade crown holding his hair shattered with a crack, and his long hair scattered. The cold, calm expression on his face was gone, replaced only by shock and disbelief.

"How can this be? How do you know the sword path of my Wansheng Sword Sect?"

Ye Yuan stared at the crimson锋芒 (sharp edge) lingering on the tip of the True Martial Sword, then looked at the sword in Xu Yunfan's hand, which was covered in cracks. His tone wavered for the first time.

His expression carried a hint of doubt.

"The sword intent of the Thousand-Chariot Geng Sea Raging Tide Sword Art... I remember that the Pure Yang True Lord had a disciple named Han Shi. This person's comprehension of the Rage-Slaughter Sword Intent is not unlike yours."

Xu Yunfan forcefully suppressed the churning blood and qi within him. The Divine霄 (Xiao) Dao Body was covered in fine cracks from the clash of wills just now, and blood from his虎口 (tiger's mouth) soaked the sword hilt.

His spiritual power circulated, and his blood and qi roared.

The injuries on his body's surface healed in the span of a breath.

He casually flicked the sword, putting on a relaxed and indifferent demeanor.

"The way of the Sword Cultivator is vast and profound. What is so strange about similar sword intents? It is merely a coincidence. My Primal Origin Sect also has true sword arts. This Taihua Lingxu World is not a place where only your Wansheng Sword Sect cultivates the sword path."

"Coincidence?"

Ye Yuan's mouth hooked into a sneer, his long hair dancing wildly in the lingering sword qi.

"The third disciple of the Wansheng Sword Sect's Pure Yang True Lord, Han Shi,领悟 (comprehended) the true meaning of 'Raging Tide into Sword · Rage-Slaughter Raging Tide' while at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment. The characteristics of his sword intent..."

He stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan. "The more enraged, the greater its power. This kind of extreme sword path is something that appears only once in a hundred years!"

Xu Yunfan's eyelid twitched, but he maintained his composure on the surface.

"To be remembered by a Sword Sect elder, he must be a brilliant and outstanding figure."

"Brilliant and outstanding? Hah!"

Ye Yuan's laugh carried a hint of disdain.

"That child's heart is as narrow and vicious as a jackal. He must bear a blood feud, otherwise he wouldn't have comprehended such a pure, extreme-killing sword intent of the Rage-Slaughter Sword Intent."

Xu Yunfan felt a chill in his heart.

Ye Yuan was saying so much because he had clearly noticed some clues.

Not a single one who can achieve Foundation Establishment is a fool.

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly, but his heart gradually calmed down.

He shared Han Shi's sword intent comprehension one-way through the Attribute Panel, but he didn't expect his clone to be so brilliant as to catch the attention of the various peaks of the Wansheng Sword Sect.

But thinking about it, it was normal. Even in the Wansheng Sword Sect, those who could comprehend sword intent and achieve the status of Sword Dao True Person numbered only about twenty.

Xu Yunfan could only顺势 (take the opportunity) to show a fitting expression of surprise.

"To be criticized as extreme by a Sword Cultivator from the Wansheng Sword Sect, this person is indeed..."

He shook his head, leaving the rest of his words unspoken but meaningful.

After all, the vast majority of Sword Cultivators from the Wansheng Sword Sect who want to comprehend sword intent are fanatics themselves. For a fanatic to call someone else a fanatic, one can imagine just how fanatical Han Shi must be.

Ye Yuan, however, no longer dwelled on Han Shi's character and turned his words sharp as a sword.

"What I am more curious about is the famous 'Xuandu Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Scripture' of your Primal Origin Sect. It seems you have cultivated it?"

Xu Yunfan's heart sank heavily, but his expression remained unchanged.

"This art is known as the supreme secret method in the path of artifact refining,"

Ye Yuan盯着 (stared at) every minute change in Xu Yunfan's expression, his pace neither fast nor slow, yet each word like a hammer. "Among them, the 'Cloud Casket Avatar Art' is particularly profound. Its original intention was to solve the difficulty of controlling fire during artifact refining, by severing an avatar to assist in fire control. However..."

He dragged out his tone, and a sharp light flashed in his eyes. "If this method is cultivated to a profound level, the severed avatar carries the main body's origin brand, but it will also grow the negative seven emotions severed from the main body, forming its own personality."

"The twisted and paranoid state is exactly the same as that Han Shi."

Having his words exposed by Ye Yuan, Xu Yunfan was not surprised. Or rather, when Ye Yuan initiated this conversation, the other party must have sensed something.

It had to be said that the vision of the Wansheng Sword Sect's Tianji Peak elder and the ability of Sword Heart Penetrating Clarity far exceeded his expectations.

Based solely on the characteristics of the sword intent, Han Shi's psychological performance, and the rumors of the Eight Sceneries Cloud Casket circulating outside, he actually pieced together an inference closest to the truth.

"Elder Ye is joking,"

Xu Yunfan's expression was flat, making it impossible to see any emotion.

"The Xuandu Eight Sceneries is an artifact refining secret art. The talk of avatars is even more ethereal. How could it..."

"Ethereal?"

Ye Yuan directly interrupted.

"If you hadn't severed such an avatar, how could you, a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Primal Origin Sect who mainly cultivates the Divine Xiao Thunder Method, be able to execute the core true transmission of the Wansheng Sword Sect, the Rage-Slaughter Sword Intent? And perfectly match its true essence of 'Rage is Sword Intent'?!"

He took a step forward. Although the tragic sword intent had dissipated, the pressure of a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator was like a mountain collapsing.

"Han Shi's actions are extreme, but his sword bone is innate. The purity of his Rage-Slaughter Sword Intent is unmatched among the younger generation. Such sword intent cannot be gained through observation and comprehension. If it were not from the same source, how could it be as easy to control as one's own arm?!"

The wind and waves of the East Sea had不知何时 (不知何时) calmed down, leaving only dead silence.

The next instant.

The starlight descending from the Zhou Tian Star Constellation Array flowed silently, reflecting the True Martial Sword in Xu Yunfan's hand, which was covered in cracks, and also reflecting the killing intent in his eyes that could not be concealed.

He had indeed underestimated the experience of a great True Person at the peak of Foundation Establishment.

Whether it was Zhang Qiaoluo or Lu Chuan, upon encountering an enemy they could not defeat, or one where fighting further was not worthwhile, they would naturally flee without hesitation.

This was deeply in line with the culture of the Primal Origin Sect.

Truly the way of wisdom.

Since it had come to this, Xu Yunfan also saw no need to continue pretending.

Ye Yuan must die today!

既然叶长老非要挑明…… (Since Elder Ye insists on making it clear...)

Xu Yunfan suddenly raised his eyes, the purple-gold thunder patterns on his Divine Xiao Dao Body flaring brightly amidst the cracks. "Then I'm afraid you won't be leaving the East Sea!"

Before his words had finished, the banner surface of the Sky-Enveloping Spirit Banner, which blotted out the sky and sun, suddenly rolled up.

The 365 main stars emitted a blinding light. The葵水 (Kui Water) Yin Thunder, carrying the grinding power of the Zhou Tian Constellation, poured down like a celestial river, splashing toward Ye Yuan.

But Xu Yunfan's true killing move was hidden in his sleeve.

A thread of Taiyin Immortal Gold Essence wrapped around his finger, obtained from the Heavenly Empress of the Heavenly Realm.

By refining it, he could, for a short period, erupt with power not inferior to a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator.

With this supplement, he could naturally level the playing field with Ye Yuan in a short time.
