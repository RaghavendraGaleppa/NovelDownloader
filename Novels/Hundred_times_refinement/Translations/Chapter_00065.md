# Chapter 15: Trials and Insights  

After resting for an hour, the starry sea within Lin Xuan's body had returned to its original state. He took out a flawed pill, sat cross-legged, and began his attempt once more.  

**Cycle.** Control the light particles to enter the flawed pill...  

*Bang!*  

Another failure. It seemed the speed of the light particles needed to be even slower.  

Rest, then try again.  

This time, Lin Xuan slowed the process further, taking it step by step. *Haste makes waste.* If the light particles entered too quickly and caused the pill to explode, then he would simply go slower.  

However, another problem arose. When the light particles entered the pill too slowly, the impurities not only failed to be purified but instead shifted within the pill, becoming even more tightly entangled with the essence—inseparable.  

It seemed that going too slow wasn't the solution either.  

Lin Xuan examined the failed product, deep in thought. The purification process was truly difficult to master. Too fast, and the pill would explode; too slow, and the impurities wouldn't be extracted. He had to find the perfect speed within a specific range to succeed.  

But what exactly was that range? The only way was to keep experimenting.  

After meditating to restore his energy, Lin Xuan resumed the purification. He spent the entire night without sleep—resting, attempting, and striving to uncover the secrets of the blue light particles as quickly as possible.  

Dawn arrived, dispelling the darkness.  

In his hand, Lin Xuan held a pure white pill. After a night of trials and wasting five flawed pills, he had finally succeeded in purifying one.  

Recalling the speed at which the light particles had flowed during the successful attempt, Lin Xuan pondered for a moment. After a brief rest, he took out another flawed pill.  

Yet, moments later, he failed again. He shook his head. Though he now understood the required speed, his control was still unrefined. There was no shortcut—only practice would make perfect.  

Still, even with his current success rate—one successful purification out of five flawed pills—a twenty percent chance wasn't bad.  

Last time, Elder Ma had tried to slight him by giving him two bottles of flawed pills instead of two proper medicinal pills. At the time, it had seemed like a raw deal. But now, with the blue light particles...  

Each bottle contained a hundred flawed pills. With two bottles, he could purify at least forty medicinal pills—twenty times more than the original two.  

A faint smile touched Lin Xuan's lips. It wasn't just the abundance of medicinal pills that pleased him, but the hope they represented. With the power of the blue light particles, even an ordinary person like him could succeed in cultivation—as long as he had enough medicinal support.  

His research into the starry sea had yielded initial results. Now, he needed to deepen his understanding and mastery.  

Pushing open the window, he saw that the sky was already bright—time for cultivation. Carefully storing the jade vial and the purified pills, Lin Xuan left his room and headed to the training hall of the Young Eagle Pavilion to meditate.  

Even with the starry sea eliminating his worries about medicinal consumption, diligence was still essential.  

---  

Over the next ten days, Lin Xuan divided his time between rigorous training and secretly purifying flawed pills. His goal wasn't just to obtain the medicinal pills he needed for cultivation but also to fully master the use of the starry sea.  

After all, this was his hope for advancing further on the path of immortality—he couldn't afford any mistakes.  

Once resolved, he began executing his plan. The process was arduous, akin to crossing a river by feeling for stones. Holding a flawed pill, he cycled the blue light, carefully controlling its speed while observing with his spiritual sense.  

*Bang!*  

Another failure. Lin Xuan's expression darkened. To others, flawed pills were worthless, but to him, each one had the potential to become a precious medicinal pill. Wasting even one pained him.  

But this was the trial phase—losses were inevitable. Moreover, aside from the consumption of flawed pills, the size of the starry sea had also diminished. He had no choice but to rest...  

Days passed in this manner—cultivating by day, purifying pills by night. Two weeks later, practice had indeed made perfect. Initially, he could only succeed once every five or six flawed pills. But as time went on, he now succeeded once every three.  

Before, a whole night of effort might yield at most two purified pills. Now, he could produce five or six low-grade Body Tempering Pills in a single night.  

His speed and success rate had improved significantly.  

After nearly a month of effort, the two bottles of flawed pills had yielded better results than expected. Accounting for failures, Lin Xuan had obtained a total of sixty medicinal pills.  

Sixty—an impressive number. An ordinary disciple would need thirty months' worth of medicinal pills to accumulate that many.  

Lin Xuan was now incredibly wealthy by comparison. He carefully stored the Body Tempering Pills away—this secret must never be revealed to another soul.  

With ample medicinal pills at his disposal, the next step was to cultivate diligently. His time in the Drifting Cloud Valley had taught him one thing clearly: **strength was the foundation of a cultivator's survival.**  

Fairness, justice, reason—these were mere words. When it came down to it, **might made right.**  

Power was directly proportional to strength.  

Moreover, even cultivators didn't possess infinite lifespans. The higher one's cultivation, the longer one lived.  

A cultivator at the Spirit Moving stage hadn't truly stepped onto the immortal path—their lifespan was similar to that of a mortal. But at the Foundation Establishment stage, it would double, allowing them to live up to two hundred years.  

At the Core Formation stage, it would double again—four hundred years. In other words, with each major breakthrough across the eight cultivation stages, one's lifespan would multiply.  

Beyond that:  
- Nascent Soul stage: 800 years  
- Soul Separation stage: 1,600 years  
- Cave Mystic stage: 3,200 years  
...and so on.  

Finally, if one could successfully transcend the Heavenly Tribulation, they would become an immortal—eternal, ageless, shining alongside the sun and moon.  

Lin Xuan didn't believe in reincarnation. Rather than pinning his hopes on the uncertain next life, he would strive harder in this one. Though he lacked spiritual roots, the blue starry sea gave him real hope on the immortal path.  

He devised a detailed cultivation plan.  

Using medicinal pills as his foundation and diligence as his guide, Lin Xuan consumed one Body Tempering Pill each in the morning, noon, and evening, then meditated to refine the medicinal energy.  

Though Body Tempering Pills weren't considered supreme treasures in the cultivation world, no one else could afford to consume several daily. Under the potent effects of the pills, after about a week, Lin Xuan felt the spiritual energy within him growing increasingly abundant. The bottleneck that had once hindered him now seemed insignificant.  

It was time to charge toward the second layer of the Spirit Moving stage!
