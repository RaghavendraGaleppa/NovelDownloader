# Chapter 71: The Secret of the Black Wooden Sword

After leaving the outer sect, Chu Ning went to bid farewell to Qiu Shunyi. Though they had entered the sect together, their circumstances were now worlds apart. When Chu Ning found him, Qiu Shunyi was still casting the Growth Technique to plant the current season's Scarlet Spirit Rice. Seeing that Qiu Shunyi hadn't even mastered instant casting of the technique yet, Chu Ning couldn't help but sigh.

He casually gave Qiu Shunyi twenty talismans, instructing him to share ten with Lü Xingyuan, and also handed over a few spirit stones. He didn't give more, knowing the dangers of attracting unwanted attention. Qiu Shunyi was both surprised and envious when he heard Chu Ning would be leaving the sect for the market.

After leaving Qiu Shunyi's spirit fields, Chu Ning returned directly to his own courtyard. He had no intention of visiting anyone else. However, breaking through beyond the sixth level of Qi Refining wouldn't be easy.

Recently, while crafting talismans, Chu Ning sometimes practiced the Spirit Refining Technique without the wooden sword and noticed fluctuations in his progress. Immersing his consciousness, he gained a clear understanding of his cultivation progress. Aside from gathering life-saving items from various people, the most crucial factor was undoubtedly his own cultivation level.

"I always thought the fluctuations in my Spirit Refining Technique progress were due to the influence of talisman crafting using spiritual sense," Chu Ning mused. "But it turns out the black wooden sword was the cause all along."

This defensive artifact was the first proper magical tool he had obtained. Currently, Chu Ning still had over two hundred spirit stones remaining. His cultivation session lasted more than an hour.

He planned to use the next five days to increase the proficiency of the Evergreen Wood Technique by 68 points and attempt a breakthrough to the sixth level. Achieving 68 proficiency points through normal cultivation was impossible. Relying solely on spirit stones for such progress would be prohibitively expensive for ordinary outer sect disciples, let alone servant disciples.

Sitting cross-legged, Chu Ning began practicing the Spirit Refining Technique. Despite his recent focus on talisman crafting and spell practice, he had never neglected his core cultivation techniques and secret arts. Now, discovering that he had possessed an item all along that could accelerate his Spirit Refining Technique progress filled him with surprise.

Chu Ning had initially attributed the accelerated spiritual sense cultivation to the liquefaction of his spiritual energy. He was now certain that once his proficiency reached 500 (an increase of 300), he would break through to the sixth level of Qi Refining. His recent practice of the Spirit Refining Technique had given him a deep appreciation for how difficult it was to enhance spiritual sense.

Previously, he had noticed that practicing the Spirit Refining Technique after using spiritual sense for talismans provided significant benefits. Suddenly, his expression became thoughtful. "What material is this black wooden sword made of? It actually aids in spiritual sense cultivation."

A prime example was Mu Ling, who undoubtedly had access to far better resources than most Qi Refining disciples in the sect, yet her progress wasn't necessarily faster than regular meditation. The first time Chu Ning experienced accelerated Spirit Refining Technique progress was the morning after his new neighbors moved in.

Taking out the black wooden sword from his storage bag, Chu Ning practiced the Spirit Refining Technique again. He had already formed a plan during his journey—first adjust his mental state to optimal condition through the Spirit Refining Technique before proceeding with further cultivation.

The silver Frost Bamboo Shield in his hand was now only palm-sized, its surface gleaming faintly. Holding the large black wooden sword, Chu Ning felt both shock and delight. That morning's practice session had coincided with the liquefaction of his spiritual sense.

Withdrawing his spiritual power contentedly, Chu Ning finally understood the true reason for his fluctuating progress. If he combined this with the black wooden sword, his progress would likely accelerate even further.

Remembering He Changyou's instructions, Chu Ning channeled spiritual energy into the shield. The proficiency of the second level of the Evergreen Wood Technique had already reached 432. Previously, when his proficiency broke through 200, he advanced from the fourth to the fifth level of Qi Refining. "This is my first genuine life-saving magical tool," he thought.

Only then did he begin to form some conjectures, which subsequent tests confirmed. He decided to explore the black wooden sword and Spirit Refining Technique further at a later time. He hadn't been practicing with the sword by his side every night as before.

Upon returning to his courtyard, he eagerly retrieved the silver Frost Bamboo Shield from his storage bag. But now, he planned to enter seclusion for several days to attempt a breakthrough to the sixth level of Qi Refining!

After an indeterminate amount of time, Chu Ning opened his eyes with a look of realization. Simultaneously, a protective barrier emerged from the Frost Bamboo Shield, enveloping his entire body.

Chu Ning first smiled wryly, then the expression transformed into one of joy. Even with his Wood Spring Technique, this breakthrough wouldn't be easy.

There were two major obstacles. First, each individual's capacity to absorb spiritual energy from stones varied. However, Chu Ning had another valuable resource—spirit stones! Over recent months, selling talismans to Mu Ling had allowed him to accumulate a considerable number.

Although He Changyou and others claimed the journey to Yanji Market was safe, Chu Ning still wanted to be prepared. This bottleneck wasn't something that could be overcome simply by absorbing more spiritual energy.

Most of his spirit stones had only been used occasionally for cultivation. The Frost Bamboo Shield shrank back to palm size and was returned to the storage bag. Still, many outer sect disciples had decent spirit stone incomes, yet none used them recklessly for rapid cultivation.

Chu Ning then practiced the Evergreen Wood Technique as a transitional exercise. [Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Volume: Unyielding Bones 167/600] He searched his knowledge of spiritual plant cultivation for answers but found none. "He Changyou's jade slip contained many plant descriptions I haven't finished reading. Maybe there's information there."

Before this, Chu Ning had already conducted experiments. The poorer one's spiritual roots and cultivation technique, the slower their spiritual energy absorption. Apart from asking Qiu Shunyi to purchase talismans from the market to guard against Qi Chongmao, he had rarely spent his stones.

[Spirit Refining Technique, First Layer 133/1000] As spiritual energy was channeled, the shield expanded to half a person's height. His daily proficiency gains were only 2-3 points. The two main obstacles were significant.

Breaking through to the sixth level of Qi Refining required reaching 500 proficiency points. Chu Ning's current task was to cultivate with full dedication. It was no wonder he hadn't considered this possibility earlier. Since he was about to leave the sect, he decided to enhance his strength first.

After reaching mid-stage Qi Refining, each level advancement involved overcoming a bottleneck. Of course, neither of these issues posed problems for Chu Ning, who possessed the Yin Wood Spiritual Body.

At that moment, Chu Ning's gaze inadvertently fell on the black wooden sword in his storage bag. Among the servant disciples in the Ding District, even those who used spirit stones for cultivation would progress only slightly faster. The speed of spiritual energy absorption was a limiting factor.

Sitting cross-legged on his bed, Chu Ning had optimized his spiritual sense and physical condition through the Spirit Refining Technique. He then took out a pile of spirit stones and grasped several in his hand.
