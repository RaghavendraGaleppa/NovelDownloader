# Chapter 14: Stepping into Qi Refinement Stage

"Now, it's about time to break through."

Returning to his small hut, Gu Mo took a deep breath. The marrow-cleansing effects from the perfected-level Cleaning Technique had been growing weaker lately.

Of course, the main reason was that his spirit stones had run out. During this period, Gu Mo had replaced the spirit stones in the Sunflower pots three times, using up all nine stones he had.

If he delayed any longer until the spirit stones in the pots were completely depleted, Gu Mo would face a resource shortage.

After adjusting his state, Gu Mo slowly activated the Qi Gathering Art, guiding the pure spiritual energy within his body to begin circulating through the first minor cycle.

With Gu Mo's control over spiritual energy and its purity, his meridians were easily expanded. In just a few hours, he successfully completed the first minor cycle. As previously mentioned, Gu Mo's entry into the Qi Refinement Stage would face no obstacles.

With the minor cycle completed, the previously stagnant spiritual energy in his dantian began to flow. The circulating energy rushed through his body like a surging river, initiating the marrow-cleansing process that accompanied a breakthrough.

"Three hours!"

Gu Mo slowly opened his eyes and calculated the time, feeling slightly shocked. The marrow-cleansing period from this breakthrough had lasted a full three hours.

From what Gu Mo knew about Qi Refinement Stage breakthroughs, the marrow-cleansing typically lasted only about an hour. His three-hour session was three times longer than average, clearly demonstrating that his previous use of the perfected-level Cleaning Technique for early marrow-cleansing had been effective.

This triple duration brought Gu Mo broader and more resilient meridians and physique. Wider meridians could accommodate more spiritual energy and allow faster circulation.

While a cultivator's spiritual energy originated from the dantian, it constantly circulated, meaning the meridians could store additional energy—this extra energy represented a cultivator's foundation.

Currently, Gu Mo's total spiritual energy was three times that of other newly entered Qi Refinement Stage cultivators.

Beyond the increase in spiritual energy, the marrow-cleansing also significantly enhanced his physique. Clenching his fists, Gu Mo felt a surge of tremendous power—roughly three times that of an average Qi Refinement Stage cultivator.

Without exaggeration, given Gu Mo's current foundation, although he had just entered the first layer of Qi Refinement, he could easily be considered a second-layer cultivator.

This was crucial for Gu Mo because, in the coming period, he planned to focus on accumulating solar essence, which would stall his cultivation progress. With spiritual energy and physique comparable to a second-layer cultivator, Gu Mo had the confidence to pause his cultivation temporarily.

Once he had enough Sunflowers, Gu Mo's cultivation could easily catch up and surpass others.

After familiarizing himself with the power boost from his breakthrough, Gu Mo casually cast a perfected-level Cleaning Technique on himself to remove the impurities from the marrow-cleansing.

However, when the perfected-level Cleaning Technique took effect, Gu Mo's expression turned to surprise. The previously weakened marrow-cleansing effect had actually intensified.

Logically, entering the Qi Refinement Stage should have nullified the marrow-cleansing effect of the perfected-level Cleaning Technique, but the opposite had occurred.

After a moment of surprise, Gu Mo quickly realized the reason: previously, his spiritual energy had been insufficient to fully execute the perfected-level Cleaning Technique.

Now, with his breakthrough, his spiritual energy far exceeded that of the Qi Attraction Stage—three times that of his peers at the same level. The amount of spiritual energy he could now wield was incomparably greater than before.

With ample spiritual energy, the perfected-level Cleaning Technique could unleash its full potential, naturally enhancing the marrow-cleansing effect.

This outcome delighted Gu Mo. Marrow-cleansing was typically a benefit only obtained during breakthroughs—nine times in total across the nine layers of Qi Refinement.

Each breakthrough provided cultivators with significant improvements, but Gu Mo could now experience marrow-cleansing effects at any time using the perfected-level Cleaning Technique. This meant that when he broke through to the second layer of Qi Refinement, he would gain even greater benefits, just as he had this time.

"All that extra time wasn't wasted!"

Gu Mo exhaled deeply. The rigorous practice of the Cleaning Technique and the delayed breakthrough had led to this substantial reward.

After spending a few days stabilizing his cultivation, Gu Mo left his hut. It was time to move on. Thanks to the Black Mist Space, he had stored all his important belongings there, so there was nothing to pack. He headed directly to the Personnel Hall in the east.

This was where servant disciples chose their respective peaks. The various peaks of the Qinglu Sect had long since sent representatives. Servant disciples who had reached the Qi Refinement Stage and wished to join a peak would register here.

Upon entering the Personnel Hall, Gu Mo found it quite crowded, with most people gathered around four tables representing the Alchemy, Artifact, Formation, and Talisman Peaks.

After a brief glance, Gu Mo turned his attention to a table in the corner—his true destination.

"Greetings, Senior Brother!"

Gu Mo approached the table representing the Spirit Plant Hall and bowed to the young man sitting behind it, who seemed lost in thought.

"Huh? Oh!"

Startled by the greeting, Mai Yunfa snapped out of his daze and looked at the youth before him. "Yes? Can I help you?"

"Senior Brother, is this the Spirit Plant Hall?" Gu Mo asked, momentarily doubting whether he had come to the right place given the other's reaction.

"Ah! Yes, yes, yes!"

Hearing Gu Mo's question, Mai Yunfa finally realized that this youth wanted to join the Spirit Plant Hall. At that moment, his eyes nearly welled up with tears—this year wouldn't end with zero recruits after all.

No one understood the Spirit Plant Hall's predicament better than Mai Yunfa, as he had been responsible for recruitment these past years. Yet, no one ever voluntarily signed up.

Everyone flocked to the neighboring Alchemy, Artifact, Formation, and Talisman Peaks. Even if rejected, they would try the Beast Taming, Puppetry, or Geomancy Peaks.

The Spirit Plant Hall typically only received servant disciples who were outright rejected by other peaks and forcibly assigned at the deadline.

It went without saying what kind of talent such rejects possessed. Managing spirit fields wasn't simple work, meaning the Spirit Plant Hall had to invest more effort into training them—with disappointing results.

With subpar servant disciples, the Spirit Plant Hall's outer sect disciples had to shoulder heavier workloads, severely hindering their cultivation.

Faced with this situation, the Spirit Plant Hall had attempted solutions, such as offering better benefits to attract talented servant disciples. But minor improvements were ineffective—the Spirit Plant Hall still couldn't compete with the popular peaks.

Significant benefit increases, however, raised the question of funding. They couldn't possibly divert resources from the outer sect disciples, let alone the hall's managers.

Yet resigning to the status quo was unacceptable, so the Spirit Plant Hall introduced non-resource-dependent preferential policies. Their effectiveness, however, was evident from Mai Yunfa's excitement—clearly, empty promises had attracted no one.

"Junior Brother, you've absolutely come to the right place by joining the Spirit Plant Hall! Let me tell you—" Mai Yunfa enthusiastically began explaining the hall's preferential policies to Gu Mo.
