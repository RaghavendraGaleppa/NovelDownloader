# Chapter 86: The Cave Dwelling  

"This is my very own cave dwelling!" Li Shiming gazed at the structure before him, murmuring with satisfaction.  

Ever since becoming a cultivator, he knew that one day he would have to leave the mundane world behind. Having left his childhood home early to travel to Zhongdu for the imperial examinations, he had long yearned for a home that matched his identity as a cultivator.  

After all he had been through, he had finally secured a home of his own within the Tianhai Sect.  

Though the dwelling was simple—nothing more than pre-existing formations and empty rooms, likely second-hand—his heart swelled with joy.  

The cave dwelling had four sections: an entrance hall that led to a cultivation chamber, which in turn had a washroom with running water. To the left and right of the entrance hall were two rooms he planned to use as storage and a cultivation space. The latter only needed to serve a superficial purpose since he intended to grow spiritual seedlings in his computer room space.  

What could be safer for nurturing spiritual seedlings than his computer room space? The greatest threat to seedlings—pests—simply didn’t exist there. Moreover, the seedlings grown in that space were of exceptionally high yield.  

He also planned to dig a hidden underground chamber for researching technology from his past life.  

The cave dwelling lacked furnishings, but cultivators rarely cared for such things. The previous owner hadn’t even bothered with a bedroom, using the cultivation chamber instead—proof of how ascetic a cultivator’s life could be.  

After cleaning the dwelling and placing a new meditation cushion in the cultivation chamber, it was finally habitable.  

He sensed the spiritual energy in the area. Beneath the cultivation chamber, faint wisps of energy seeped upward. Likely, this was where the spiritual vein lay, though he couldn’t tell how deep it ran. Normally, spiritual veins were buried far underground, their energy rising through natural fissures.  

As expected of a subpar spiritual vein—Li Shiming couldn’t help but shake his head.  

Fortunately, he had a Spirit Gathering Plate. Without it, the weak spiritual energy here would severely hinder his cultivation.  

He placed the plate over the vein’s exit to accelerate the flow of energy. Since this vein was connected to the sect’s main spiritual vein, there was no risk of over-extraction. Additionally, the plate would draw in surrounding spiritual energy, increasing the concentration on Eagle Beak Island.  

With the island’s defensive formation in place, it was relatively safe.  

Still, he wished he had his own defensive formation. The one provided by the sect was a shared resource, accessible through his identity token—but so were the tokens of higher-ranking sect members.  

Even the cave dwelling’s formations needed reinforcement.  

---  

Li Shiming stepped outside and returned to the spirit fields. He took out his identity token and deactivated the field’s stabilization.  

Instantly, the fields came alive, spiritual energy surging through the soil.  

"Earth Spirit Art!" He traced a runic array with his fingers, activating the technique to regulate the energy within the fields.  

Though he had learned the Earth Spirit Art long ago, this was his first time applying it.  

Within a minute, he went from clumsy to proficient. The IBMz15 recorded every detail of the fields, presenting the data in clear, actionable terms.  

Once the energy was evenly distributed, the restless fluctuations ceased.  

Instead of planting spiritual rice immediately, he used telekinesis to gather soil samples into his computer room space. There, he meticulously separated insect eggs from the soil before returning it to the fields.  

It took half a day to cleanse all five acres of fields, yielding a fist-sized clump of insect eggs. Had the fields been in regular use, the infestation would have been far worse.  

Next, he transplanted pre-grown spiritual rice seedlings from his computer room space into the fields. For now, he didn’t have enough to fill even one acre, but within five days, the entire plot would be covered.  

The five acres were an experiment in his skills as a spiritual farmer. Yield wasn’t a concern—his computer room already held over 2,000 pounds of spiritual rice, with another batch soon to mature, ensuring he could meet his quota for the next three years.  

After casting the Spring Rain Art several times to nourish the seedlings, he laid out soil from his storage bag beside the cave dwelling and planted a stalk of Rune Bamboo.  

The spiritual tea plant, however, remained in his computer room space.  

He planned to pause rice cultivation there temporarily, freeing up space for future research. Countless ideas swirled in his mind, all requiring room for experimentation.  

A few applications of the Spring Rain Art later, the Rune Bamboo thrived. The Hao Clan, lacking even a basic spiritual farmer, had kept it alive with minimal care—surely he, a trained cultivator, could manage without relying solely on his computer room.  

---  

By nightfall, though the fields and bamboo still looked sparse, he knew that once fully planted and with new bamboo shoots sprouting, the landscape would transform.  

Back in his cave dwelling, the Spirit Gathering Plate had significantly increased the concentration of spiritual energy. Most of it flowed into the cultivation chamber, where the energy above the plate had more than doubled in density.  

While it couldn’t compare to the central peak’s richness, it was more than enough for his needs.  

That night, he practiced the Five Elements Absorption Art and the Diamond Body Protection Technique for the first time in his new home, followed by a midnight sparring session with his copper corpse.  

The next morning, he summoned the corpse from its storage pouch.  

Its appearance was ghastly, a testament to the poor aesthetic sense of the Profound Nether Sect cultivator who had crafted it.  

Li Shiming replaced its black robes with a white Breeze Robe, while he donned the sect’s standard attire. Dressed in flowing white, the copper corpse now resembled a scholarly farmer, its muscular frame hidden beneath the loose fabric.  

He also discovered the purpose of the massive low-grade artifact he’d found in the late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator’s storage bag—it was a weapon for the corpse.  

The copper corpse’s strength was terrifying. Even bare-handed, a casual strike could obliterate Li Shiming, a mere third-stage Qi Refinement cultivator with only basic mastery of the Diamond Body Protection Technique.  

Of course, a seventh-stage Qi Refinement copper corpse wasn’t something any cultivator—let alone him—could afford to face head-on without formidable defenses.
