# Chapter 409: 'Qin Yuzhi'?

The moment the Crystal Palace doors closed, a profound silence descended, as if the place had been completely cut off from the outside world.

The attack of a Sixth Realm Law Body powerhouse landed on the Crystal Palace, yet the palace did not even tremble in the slightest.

"Good thing the doors closed so quickly."

Li Mo did not dare to relax in the slightest.

Which was more dangerous, the inside or the outside, was truly hard to say.

"Another Heavenly Phoenix Domain..."

Ying Bing raised her face, the reflection of a constantly swirling and extinguishing light sphere appearing in her eyes.

The light illuminating the entire Crystal Palace came from that nebulous sphere floating at the apex of the dome. Within the light, scenes of tribes, villages, and cities would occasionally appear.

It was as if there was a world within it, constantly evolving, multiplying, and caught in an endless cycle!

Heaviness, antiquity, extinction, and prosperity—all rushed towards them.

A sense of familiarity surging from the depths of her soul constantly reminded her.

This Heavenly Phoenix Domain was real.

The light, like tentacles, wrapped around the crystal coffin below, vaguely revealing a figure lying within, though its face was indiscernible.

"So you have found this place after all."

At that moment, a female voice suddenly echoed throughout the palace.

As the voice spoke, the sphere of light stopped its flickering cycle of birth and destruction, revealing a magnificent temple scene. Inside the temple, it seemed a ceremony was being held, with people coming and going as if they were real.

Suddenly, everyone within the scene froze, leaving only the woman standing on the altar, who turned to look at them.

"Who is speaking?!"

A trickle of fresh blood flowed from Tian Miao's lips.

She had just used a technique to read fate and fortune, but all she saw was a chaotic void. She quickly stopped, or the consequences would have been far more serious than just spitting up a bit of blood.

Li Mo gripped the handle of the Eighty, the weight of the hammer giving him a slight sense of security. He immediately activated his Eye of Fate.

But what it showed... was a string of question marks.

Li Mo suddenly remembered what Tian Miao had said: there are three types of existences that are inscrutable and beyond the reach of fate.

Powerhouses whose strength has reached a terrifying level... those who possess divine artifacts that can shield them from fate's perception... and existences that do not belong to this world, like himself, who have no color to their fate and whose future cannot be seen by the Eye.

Which category did the speaker belong to?

Or perhaps... more than one?

"I am Qin Yuzhi," the female voice sighed. She drifted down from the dream-like sphere of light.

She wore a black robe similar in style to that of the Demon Summoning Sect. She appeared to be around thirty years old, yet carried a faint aura of decrepitude. Her features were sharp, and her eyes were a grayish-white, seeming to透着 a certain divinity as she looked at the three of them.

She looked at the three of them—more accurately, she was looking at the Ice Cube.

Li Mo's first reaction was to block her line of sight, the pure brilliance of the Great Yin rising behind him.

However, through his soul-sense perception, he discovered that she was not a physical entity, as if she didn't truly exist.

It was uncertain; he needed to test it.

*Whoosh—*

He casually tossed a gold brick.

The brick passed straight through her body without any obstruction, landing on the ground with a heavy *thud*.

'Qin Yuzhi': "..."
Ying Bing: "..."
Tian Miao: "???"

Li Mo felt a slight sense of relief. If she only existed as a soul, even if she was a high-level expert in her lifetime, she would be far less formidable than when she had a physical body.

He lifted his hammer and asked, "Was it you who released the Black Year Beast to kill the Ying clan members?"

"It was me, and yet it was not me. To be precise, it was *Her*."

'Qin Yuzhi' shook her head and pointed to the figure inside the crystal coffin.

"?"

Even after having seen the diary on the murals, Li Mo was almost confused by this.

In other words, the master of the Black Year Beast was that Ancestor of Cloud and Dream?

---

"Did you write the diary outside?"

'Qin Yuzhi' nodded slightly. "Ever since I became the Sect Master of the Divine Sect and inherited the Dream Dao, I felt another consciousness awakening within me, trying to replace my true self. Later, I consulted many ancient texts and discovered a secret."

"The successors of the Nine Heavens are not truly inheritors."

"To withstand the erosion of time, the inheritance is actually the seed of their awakening. As one's cultivation level rises, they become more and more like 'Them,' until finally, 'They' will awaken from within your body..."

'Qin Yuzhi' sighed. "After discovering this, I began overseeing the construction of the Cloud Dream Palace, sealed my physical body in the coffin, and let my soul escape into the Heavenly Phoenix Domain, waiting for it all to end."

"Fortunately, before the Primordial Phoenix Ancestor returned, *She* had not yet managed to break the seal."

Primordial Phoenix Ancestor?

Tian Miao was stunned.

Li Mo was taken aback. This couldn't possibly be referring to him, so it could only be...

The Ice Cube?

But the Ice Cube grew up with him since childhood. How could she be that Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix who led the Nine Heavens to descend?

Wait.

The Crimson Phoenix Aura, the Blood Phoenix Essence, and the Jade Phoenix Spirit... these three treasures belonging to the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix are now all on the Ice Cube, aren't they?

So, the woman mistook her for the Ancestor because of this?

That was very likely the case!

He gently squeezed the Ice Cube's delicate hand.

The Best Actress of Qingyuan Sect! Activated!

"You have worked hard," Ying Bing said with an icy expression, like a goddess looking down upon the mortal world. For her, this was pure nature.

"It was all as you instructed," 'Qin Yuzhi' bowed again.

Watching this scene, Tian Miao's mind was in turmoil. She hadn't expected such a turn of events.

Even with her intelligence, she was both shocked and confused by what was happening, as the information was insufficient.

*As you instructed...*

There had been a conflict within the Nine Heavens' immortals, though the reason was still unclear.

But it wasn't hard to understand that the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix would restrict the awakening of the other immortals.

"You seem less powerful than in the past?"

'Qin Yuzhi' looked at Ying Bing and narrowed her eyes slightly.

Ying Bing's face was as cold as a mirror, her expression blank. "Are you probing me?"

Li Mo gave a mental thumbs-up. The Ice Cube truly lived up to her name; it didn't look like she was acting at all. It seemed she had been influenced quite a bit by the Best Actor...

"Please forgive me," 'Qin Yuzhi' lowered her gaze, as if finally relieved of a burden. "The Heavenly Phoenix Domain originally belonged to you. Please, take it back to prevent the Ancestor of the Great Dream from awakening. With you personally taking charge, it will surely be foolproof."

"At that time, you can open the crystal coffin and let my physical body return to dust. I will have fulfilled my purpose."

"Hmm..." Ying Bing's mirror-like eyes flickered.

She was also curious about what was really going on with this Heavenly Phoenix Domain...

But at that moment, Li Mo suddenly pulled her back. "Something's not right!"

Qin Yuzhi looked puzzled.

Li Mo suddenly asked Tian Miao, "Tian Miao, did you just see her fate?"

Tian Miao shook her head.

Li Mo became even more certain. He turned back and said in a deep voice, "Qin Yuzhi's physical body is gone, and she only has her soul left. It's impossible not to be able to see her fate!"

"Unless... you are not Qin Yuzhi at all!"
