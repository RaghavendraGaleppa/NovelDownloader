# Chapter 205: The Real and Fake Bear Mountain

In the northern district of Moonview City, within a cave residence.

The Dai family members were still listening to Zhu Duiyou's exhaustive analysis: "Therefore, all evidence in this case points to one person—Bear Mountain Sage!"

"The identity 'Bu Peiying from Wanliu Academy' is likely his alias, including the 'Lin' surname used at the Lin Merchant House—all are his disguises!"

"Outwardly, this person appears righteous and dignified, but in truth, he's ruthless, cunning, and utterly wicked. Otherwise, how could a Golden Core cultivator from the Dai family have fallen victim to him?"

The listeners were stunned, unsure why Zhu Duiyou was so confident in asserting that the man's true name was "Bear Mountain Sage." Was it simply because the name sounded like a bandit's?

Dai Budong, having heard the analysis, voiced his doubts: "Brother Zhu's reasoning makes sense. The moniker 'Bear Mountain Sage' does fit that scoundrel's modus operandi. But isn't it somewhat arbitrary to conclude based solely on that? Perhaps one of the other two aliases is his real name."

Other Dai family members nodded in agreement, unable to discern which name was genuine.

Zhu Duiyou waved his hand dismissively, uninterested in debating the point. "It's unimportant. His aliases are merely titles—we can refer to him by any. For now, let's temporarily call him Bear Mountain Sage."

The group acquiesced without objection, though they remained puzzled about how a Foundation Establishment cultivator could have slain a Golden Core expert.

Zhu Duiyou continued reconstructing events: "After Elder Dai proposed acquiring the Lin Merchant House, negotiations likely broke down over price or other reasons. Bear Mountain Sage and his skeleton monster refused, prompting Elder Dai to leverage his influence, applying pressure through multiple channels while carefully planning his next move."

"Unwilling to await his doom, Bear Mountain Sage fled with his belongings. Elder Dai discovered this and personally pursued him beyond the city."

"Based on residual traces of Elder Dai's aura, eyewitness accounts of Golden Core rainbow flight techniques along the route, and the direction indicated by his extinguished soul lamp in the family hall, we've triangulated his final location to be..."

"The Juesha Heavenly Pit!"

Zhu Duiyou unfurled a map and tapped a small black circle west of Moonview City with his feathered fan's handle, leaving a mark. The group leaned in, nodding like chicks pecking at rice, deeply impressed.

With only fragmented clues and subtle traces from the family, Zhu Duiyou had pinpointed the site of their elder's demise without even conducting thorough field investigations—a testament to his prowess as a prodigy of Jingyang Academy, strategizing across vast distances from the comfort of his study.

---

"The Juesha Heavenly Pit is an extremely ominous place, where endless yin energy seeps from the depths, obscuring visibility and enabling ambushes. Knowing he couldn't outrun a Golden Core pursuer, Bear Mountain Sage had no choice but to make his final stand there!" Zhu Duiyou expounded confidently.

The Dai family members buzzed with discussion:

"But our Elder Dai was a Golden Core cultivator! Bear Mountain Sage is merely Foundation Establishment. Even with a skeleton monster's assistance, how could he possibly overcome such a gap?"

"What if he utilized terrain advantages?"

"Terrain alone couldn't bridge that chasm. The difference between Foundation Establishment and Golden Core is like an un-crossable gulf. Only heaven-defying geniuses could achieve such a feat!"

"An immortal dao genius? Unlikely. The entire Lu Kingdom's cultivation world has only one living genius—from White Deer Academy. Not even the Kong or Meng noble families have produced one."

Zhu Duiyou shook his head, proposing an alternative: "Don't forget—during certain events in the recent righteous-demonic war, Bear Mountain Sage revealed he had a Nascent Soul master, the mighty Pure Lotus Scholar. It's entirely possible this supreme expert bestowed his disciple with a life-preserving treasure."

"What treasure could enable a Foundation Establishment cultivator to kill a Golden Core?"

"The world holds endless wonders. Setting aside unorthodox methods, just among the six orthodox cultivation arts—talismans, artifacts, spirit beasts, formations, alchemy, and puppets—any high-grade item could potentially achieve this."

Eyes gleaming with wisdom, Zhu Duiyou seemed to peer through veils of mystery: "During the battle at the demonic sects' headquarters, when Bear Mountain Sage posed as Bu Peiying, his skeleton monster displayed remarkable formation mastery. Thus, I suspect they employed a formation—likely a lethal array leveraging the Juesha Heavenly Pit's natural advantages!"

"That skeleton monster is probably a formation-deploying puppet gifted by Pure Lotus Scholar. For it to arrange such a terrain-exploiting master-level formation, its grade must be extraordinary."

"The cultivation world has diverse puppets—alchemy, artifact-forging, gatekeeping, message-carrying, scouting, combat types, etc. That Bear Mountain Sage possesses a formation puppet isn't surprising, given his master's stature."

The group found this plausible. With a Nascent Soul master backing him, acquiring a master-level formation puppet seemed reasonable. To these orthodox Confucian cultivators, skeletons naturally suggested puppets or corpse-refining—no one imagined something as bizarre as "an otherworldly ghostly avatar projection."

---

Of course, their limited cultivation realms and experience might explain this oversight. The Black Skeleton Demon Lord was simply assumed to be a "formation puppet."

Dai Budong suddenly had another thought: "Could it be that my uncle wasn't killed by Bear Mountain Sage, but by his master, Pure Lotus Scholar?"

Zhu Duiyou shook his head. "Jingyang Academy's Nascent Soul ancestor has been pursuing Pure Lotus Scholar relentlessly, reportedly chasing him beyond Lu Kingdom into the Piro Desert, with no return yet. The hunt must still be ongoing, leaving Pure Lotus Scholar no opportunity to intervene."

After lengthy discussion, everyone accepted Zhu Duiyou's conclusion—that the Dai family's Golden Core elder had fallen to Bear Mountain Sage's ambush using a prearranged formation. Spirits lifted with this revelation.

"Brother Zhu, should I dispatch messengers to inform our elders? Presenting your deductions might save considerable investigation time," Dai Budong proposed.

Zhu Duiyou immediately waved this away. "Insufficient! Brother Dai, the blame you shoulder is immense. Merely reporting speculation won't offset your failures—why undertake such thankless labor?"

Dai Budong's eyes gleamed with dawning understanding, surprised by his friend's audacity. "You mean... for us to capture the culprit ourselves?"

The Dai members gasped. Bear Mountain Sage had slain a Golden Core expert! Even if only Foundation Establishment, his combat prowess defied norms!

Noting their trepidation, Zhu Duiyou chuckled. "What's this? During the succession struggle, you all boasted fearless ambition, uncaring of potential fatal consequences. Now you quail before one minor Bear Mountain Sage?"

Noble family succession wars were brutal. Siblings vied mercilessly for the chance to advance to Golden Core, with deaths being commonplace. Only the victor inherited family resources to breakthrough, while losers became stepping stones.

Great families never lacked talent—they needed high-level cultivators as true pillars. One competent Golden Core expert was worth five, even ten Foundation Establishment disciples in their eyes!

---

Resources were always scarce, allocated only to the most promising candidates—this was how noble families maintained Golden Core experts across generations. Like rearing venomous insects, casualties were inevitable.

Dai Budong suddenly slammed the table, his expression turning fierce. "Exactly! To rise above, we must stake our lives! But Brother Zhu, setting aside whether we can apprehend him—what if Pure Lotus Scholar later seeks vengeance?"

Zhu Duiyou fanned himself calmly. "Pure Lotus Scholar possesses the Wind Messenger treasure, making him hunted by both righteous and demonic factions. Imagine such a long-range communication artifact in the hands of heretic sects like the Black Lotus Sect—spreading doctrines, harvesting faith power globally. The havoc it could wreak! The benefits they'd gain!"

"No faction could resist such temptation. Thus, Pure Lotus Scholar has neither time nor energy to trouble us—he's fighting for survival."

"Even if he eventually comes for revenge, we'll accept our fate then. But Brother Dai, if you miss this chance to redeem yourself, you'll never breakthrough to Golden Core. Which matters more?"

"Victors become kings; losers become bandits. Once I ascend, why care about consequences?"

Zhu Duiyou's piercing words struck like a tolling bell, awakening Dai Budong anew. Choking up, he grasped Zhu Duiyou's hands. "Thank heavens for you, Brother Zhu! I nearly missed this opportunity—the regret would've been eternal!"

Inspired, the Dai clansmen pledged unwavering loyalty, vowing to follow through even if it meant traversing mountains of blades and seas of fire—let alone confronting one Bear Mountain Sage.

They then sought Zhu Duiyou's strategic counsel.

"Undoubtedly, after killing Elder Dai, Bear Mountain Sage secretly returned to Moonview City. The recent sell-off of Dai family assets proves his presence!"

"His Lin Merchant House remains unsold. Knowing his greed, he'd cling to wealth over safety—he hasn't fled yet. This is our golden opportunity!"

---

Zhu Duiyou strode outside, the group following. "Finding, monitoring, and confining him in Moonview City achieves half our success."

"If he stays, our arriving Golden Core elders can publicly arrest him as Elder Dai's murderer—the city administration will likely oblige our family."

"If he flees, our combined strength can delay him outside. Without preparation time for formations, his skeleton puppet's greatest advantage is nullified."

"Moreover, Brother Dai ranked top in Cloudchasm Academy, standing among the elite Foundation Establishment combatants. This plan is highly feasible!"

The group nodded approvingly at Zhu Duiyou's meticulous arrangements—until he added: "As a Foundation Establishment cultivator myself, I can assist Brother Dai in combat—"

"NO!" they chorused instantly.

"Absolutely not!"

"Please remain our strategist!"

Clearly, Zhu Duiyou's notorious combat reputation prompted rare unanimity.

After finalizing details, the group dispersed to scour the city for their quarry while secretly monitoring all city gates.

---

Meanwhile, near Moonview City's southern gate, the real Bear Mountain Sage—a burly man from Great Song—wandered dazedly, oblivious to the storm bearing his name.

Having trailed his nominal master Pure Lotus Scholar for years, surviving treacherous journeys to reach Lu Kingdom, he now found himself adrift. The only lead—an ephemeral sighting of a Qinglotus-using Nascent Soul expert during a treasure dispute years prior—offered little concrete direction.

His travel-weary purse nearly empty, establishing himself in pricey Moonview City seemed impossible. Banditry was unthinkable in Confucian-ruled Lu Kingdom—he'd be executed by righteous enforcers immediately.

"But I'm a Foundation Establishment cultivator! Surely finding decent work here shouldn't be hard...?"

---

Entering a bustling market, he was immediately swarmed by promoters thrusting cards at him:

"Fellow Daoist, I'm from the cultivation construction market—my card."

"Fellow, I represent fashionable robe designs—my card."

"Brother, spirit farmland leasing agent—my card."

"Honored guest, pleasure house promoter—my card."

...

Pocketing the cards (especially the risqué ones), the rough-mannered Bear Mountain Sage marveled at this novelty. But seeing they advertised menial jobs, he scoffed.

"A Foundation Establishment cultivator, laboring for you? Preposterous!"

Further ahead, a recruitment fair bustled with young scholars presenting resumes. Bear Mountain Sage gawked like a country bumpkin, drawing odd looks.

The busiest booth belonged to "Lin Merchant House," manned by a middle-aged examiner whose credentials awed applicants:

[Lü Xiuming: Jingyang Academy graduate, 15 years experience, current Lin Merchant House General Manager, mentor to numerous talents.]

The recruitment drive—actually Black Skeleton Demon Lord's scheme to inflate the business's value before selling—lured many aspiring scholars unaware of the ruse.

Seeing the impressive benefits listed, Bear Mountain Sage's heart stirred. The merchant house's rising prominence made it an attractive venture for ambitious youths.

Unbeknownst to him, destiny's wheels had begun turning inexorably...
