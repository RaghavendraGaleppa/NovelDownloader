Chapter 292: Joining the Candle Cult

Li Xian came from a humble background, stepping onto the path of martial arts by chance. He had struggled through hardships, tasting the bitter and the sour, to achieve his current status. He often lamented his difficult journey, feeling that his lowly origins were blocking his path forward.

He saw that Li Xian remained calm in the face of glory and disgrace, a rare state of mind. Moreover, the "Ghost-Slain Spear" was quite extraordinary, and he seemed to have a deep connection with the Candle Cult. Chu Liuqing had high standards and looked down on Li Xian, but Shi Yufei felt a great fondness for him. Reminded of his own past experiences, he was willing to offer guidance and assistance.

He said, "Actually... not only Venerable Chu possesses a Candle Token, but I also have one."

He turned his hand over, and a black token lay quietly in his palm.

Li Xian had already guessed that Chief Envoy Shi wanted to recruit him into the Candle Cult. He pondered internally: "I have already entered the Flower Cage Sect, and it wouldn't be impossible to join the Candle Cult as well. Although I have reached the second realm of martial arts, I lack the capability to develop independently. I must first seek survival, then consider other matters."

He remained silent.

Shi Yufei said, "However, my Candle Token is far inferior to Venerable Chu's. The Flower Cage Sect's status within the Candle Cult is already extremely low. Look at this token; the back is stamped with a 'Flower' pattern, marking its origin and indicating who sent it. If you possess this token and encounter members of the Candle Cult in the future, and you show your tokens to each other, the other party will immediately know you come from the Flower Cage Sect, and you will inevitably be looked down upon."

Li Xian smiled. "Sarcasm and disdain—I have never cared about them."

Shi Yufei nodded. "How could I not know that?"

"I saw that your Ghost-Slain Spear had achieved success and decided to recruit you long ago. I delayed giving you the token to see if there was any turning point. Perhaps Venerable Chu would change her mind and grant you a token?"

"If I could receive a token from Venerable Chu, that would naturally be better."

"I received news today that the matter is settled. That is why I have come."

Li Xian said, "Chief Envoy Shi values me, and I am flattered. Venerable Chu has a sharp eye and has her own considerations. Although I feel regret, I can only blame my own limited ability for failing to enter her eyes."

Shi Yufei laughed. "Once you accept this token, you will be a member of the Candle Cult. It's a pity... my status within the sect is very low, and it is difficult to learn profound martial arts. You have already started higher than I did. I look forward to seeing how far you can go in the future."

Li Xian took the token and hid it in his sleeve, feeling a bit dazed. "So I have joined the Candle Cult? The Candle Cult is a forbidden demonic sect. I entered the Flower Cage Sect first, and now the Candle Cult. In this way, am I not a villain who is both lecherous and wicked? The ways of the world are unpredictable."

Shi Yufei continued, "In this vast Water Altar, there are only five members of the Candle Cult. Me, Yan Hao, Ye Cheng, Hao Qingshe... and now, you."

"Your identity in the Candle Cult must not be leaked. Otherwise, if you are hunted down, your life will be hard to save. Hmm... I am not as capable as Venerable Chu and have nothing to give you. The martial arts of the Candle Cult are difficult for even me to access, and I am not qualified to pass them on."

"How about this? I will give you two apiaries and an orchard."

Li Xian was startled. "Chief Envoy Shi, isn't this gift too heavy?"

Shi Yufei smiled. "What is this? You must know that if Venerable Chu had chosen you, wealth and honor, and even reaching the peak, would have been possible. I can only give you some secular industries. The difference is vast."

Li Xian thought that Shi Yufei had already planned this. Granting the token to recruit him and rewarding him with industries to take care of him were all predetermined. It was useless to refuse, and these industries were indeed very useful. Although his martial arts and other paths were steadily advancing, without money and property, he ultimately had no foundation.

He simply accepted.

Shi Yufei said, "Although you have entered the Candle Cult, you are from the Flower Cage Sect. You should strive hard in the future to improve your status within the sect. Elder Tong Sannian is dead, and the elder position is vacant. If you are suitable, you can take that position."

Li Xian was shocked. "Chief Envoy Shi, this is too fast."

Shi Yufei laughed. "Is it fast? Shan Guyun is young, yet he has already made the Earth Ranking. Your talent and mind are both exceptional. Work hard. Moreover, our Flower Cage Sect needs to promote a visible figure to hold up the banner and gather the hearts of the people."

"By the way, has that girl been listening to you?"

He was referring to Nan Gong Liuli.

Li Xian said, "She has a stubborn temper, but I have tamed her a little."

Shi Yufei laughed. "Good, good. You continue. I have important matters to attend to." He turned and left.

Li Xian held the Candle Token and pondered for a long time. It had been over a month since entering the Water Altar, and changes had come quickly.

"Joining the Candle Cult, Chief Envoy Shi will surely cultivate me. This is both a good and a bad thing. I am deeply entangled with the Flower Cage Sect. I might even become an elder in the future. Well, I'll just take it one step at a time."

In this way, Tong Sannian's legacy fell into Li Xian's hands. Shi Yufei had other considerations. Giving these orchards and apiaries to anyone else would be inappropriate. If he kept them, Han Zisha and An Weicheng would always be watching, trying to get them for themselves. By rewarding them to Li Xian, it would inevitably cause dissatisfaction, but it was also a form of training.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]
[Ghost-Slain Spear]
[Proficiency: 1639/15000 Great Perfection]

Li Xian wielded the spear like a phantom. The spear turned with his body, dancing rapidly and拨动 (stirring). The Ghost-Slain image was etched into his heart, and the ghostly figures in the painting evolved into spear techniques and stances. "Probing the Grass to Startle the Ghost," "Ripping Open the Belly," "Crows Defeating the Moon," "Desolate Village, Broken Temple." The technique names emphasized meaning over form. He suddenly had an epiphany, thrusting his spear forward and deriving a new move from the painting: "Panicked Desperation."

In the morning, he practiced spear techniques, sweating profusely. Then, he expelled the浊 (turbid) from his five organs, calmed his Qi and blood, and stabilized his mind. Nan Gong Liuli brought over "White Porridge" and "Salted Flower Vegetables," smiling. "Good brother, it's time to eat."

They had lived together for over a month and were quite intimate. The residence gradually had grains and food stored. Nan Gong Liuli, who had never done manual work, started cooking porridge, learning to make a few dishes, washing clothes, and managing the household. Li Xian joked with her. After finishing the white porridge, he suddenly smiled. "Liuli, do you want to go out and play today?"

Nan Gong Liuli嗔ed (coyly chided), "You little rascal, you're teasing me again. How can I go out?"

Li Xian said, "Of course you can. You just need to do this and that." He whispered into her ear. Hearing this, Nan Gong Liuli's face turned bright red.

Li Xian asked, "Liuli, do you agree?" Nan Gong Liuli widened her eyes, looking both expectant and shy. "Are you telling the truth? Are you playing with me?"

Li Xian said, "Absolutely not. Liuli... don't you trust me?" Nan Gong Liuli said, "It's precisely because you are this bad boy that I don't trust you." Her eyes wavered, her mind in turmoil. "Fine... I'll do as you say."

Li Xian had obtained Tong Sannian's legacy: two apiaries and an orchard. Today was the official handover. He needed to inspect the locations. The journey was far, so he had rented a carriage.

According to the Flower Cage Sect's rules. If a beautiful consort wants to go out, she must be bound with "Flower Ropes." Restricting her limbs, sealing her internal Qi, and blocking her tongue. The Water Altar island was enclosed; it wasn't that they feared the consorts would escape. It was that the consorts were all captured. If they seized an opportunity for revenge and killed the disciples, it would cause panic and ruin the atmosphere.

Nan Gong Liuli hesitated. "If I am seen, I will die of shame." Her heart pounded inexplicably. She didn't know if it was because of going out to see the scenery or for other reasons.

Li Xian smiled. "You stay inside the carriage. Just let me see you, is that okay?" Nan Gong Liuli nodded. "Okay." Immediately after, her cheeks flushed red, feeling she had misspoken and lost her reserve. She angrily said, "You rogue, I won't let you see me."

Nan Gong Liuli fidgeted for a moment, then sat down obediently. Li Xian took out the Flower Rope and, following the "Flower Cage Sect" method, tied her hands, feet, and acupoints tightly. Nan Gong Liuli was both shy and startled, twisting her body. She felt a酥麻 (numbing) sensation all over, making it hard to resist. In a daze, she was captured again.

Li Xian helped her put on a cloak, wrapped his arm around her waist, and said, "Let's go." Seeing the cloak covering her, hiding all her embarrassment, her expression softened slightly. She pleaded, "Good brother... please don't... don't bully me outside."

Li Xian said softly, "Don't worry, I will protect you."

Nan Gong Liuli relaxed completely. Hearing Li Xian's soft comfort was like eating honey, making her more attached. She lightly bounced on her feet and walked to the side door.

Li Xian helped her into the carriage. He then drove the carriage along the bluestone road. The journey was very smooth. Nan Gong Liuli wanted to open the curtain to see the street scene, but her hands were bound tightly, making it hard to move even a little. Her internal Qi was also difficult to circulate. She used her head to push against the curtain, barely managing to lift it.

Nan Gong Liuli suddenly thought: "Ah! I've fallen into his trap! Although the Flower Cage Sect rules are like this, we could have just pretended. Why did he have to be so serious? He's deliberately teasing me." Her beautiful eyes flashed with anger as she glared at Li Xian, but she was already on the pirate ship; it was too late.

Her face was red, feeling very strange. She looked at the street scenes, seeing the peaceful common people and the lively market. There was a pavilion in the Qingniu Residence, six or seven stories high, from which one could overlook the street. When she had free time, she would read in the pavilion and watch the street scenes.

But she hadn't融入 (integrated into) the market for a long time. The rare chance to融入 (integrate) was in such a state. Suddenly, the carriage stopped. Li Xian ran to a vendor's stall and bought two dry pancakes.

He lifted the carriage curtain, placed the pancakes on the small table, and smiled. "If you're hungry, eat them yourself." Nan Gong Liuli glared at him and spat, "Bastard." Seeing his grinning face made her even angrier, but she couldn't hit him.

The carriage drove out of the city. The bluestone road turned into a yellow dirt road, becoming steep and bumpy. Nan Gong Liuli was jolted from side to side, but she could do nothing. The scenery outside the window turned into trees and flowers, knowing they had left the city.

The carriage seats were stiff. Nan Gong Liuli secretly complained, feeling restless, but looking at the surrounding scenery, it seemed there was still a long way to go.

The island was very large, with several small islands attached to it. Martial artists drink the essence of heaven and earth, taking from nature. Fishing, chopping firewood, boiling water, hunting... are also taking from nature.

Managing livelihoods is cultivation. Virtue carries things, and wealth carries martial arts. Han Zisha and An Weicheng奔波 (bustled about) for the apiaries and orchards, which is enough to show this.

The carriage stopped by a lakeshore. Li Xian lifted the carriage curtain and smiled. "Liuli, come down." Nan Gong Liuli was jolted dizzy. Supported down from the carriage, her legs were sore and numb, and she almost couldn't stand steady. She said, "Haven't we arrived yet? Where are we going?"

Li Xian said, "I can't say. You'll know soon. Let's wait here. Eat the dry pancakes first."

Nan Gong Liuli said, "Acting mysterious, and I'm the one suffering."

Li Xian supported Nan Gong Liuli and walked towards the shade of a tree. It was late August, scorching hot, but the shade was cool. Nan Gong Liuli's legs were tied together, so she could only sit with her knees bent.

Li Xian broke the dry pancake and fed it to her. Three bites of pancake, one sip of cold water. Nan Gong Liuli had been teased by Li Xian and was secretly sulking, but seeing Li Xian's thoughtful care, her anger subsided. The scenery here was beautiful, shaded by green trees, with a gentle breeze blowing.

The heat was dispersed, making it quite leisurely and enjoyable. The pancake was very filling. Nan Gong Liuli ate half a piece and was already full. Li Xian also ate half, drank some water, and leaned against the tree to chat.

Unable to resist, Nan Gong Liuli leaned against him comfortably and dozed off in a daze. It was surprisingly sweet and comfortable. After a quarter of an hour, a medium-sized boat drifted in from the distance.

Li Xian said, "They're here!" He picked up Nan Gong Liuli.

The boat drifted to the shore. A middle-aged man named Fu Dachun stepped off the boat. He cupped his fists. "Elder Hua!"

Nan Gong Liuli was startled. She immediately thought: "Elder Hua? Referring to Hua Wucuo? When did he become an elder?" She looked at him in surprise and anger. Li Xian whispered, "I'll explain when we get back."

He then smiled at Fu Dachun. "I am not yet an elder. I have come to collect the apiary today. Please lead the way."

Fu Dachun said, "Okay, please board the boat, sir." Nan Gong Liuli's expression was strange. Her feet couldn't move. If she had to hop to walk, it would be too embarrassing and expose her predicament. So she stood still.

Li Xian deliberately ignored her. He let her be angry for a moment, then picked her up horizontally and boarded the boat. There was a horse stable in the cabin. The horse was pulled onto the boat, and the carriage was left on the shore. Once everything was ready, the boat slowly left the shore and headed towards an island.

Nan Gong Liuli was supported to stand by the side of the deck, looking at the scenery of Dongran Lake. She had been captured and brought here, but this was the first time she saw the scenery of Dongran Lake. Huaiyin Prefecture's "Dongran Lake" was a world-famous wonder.

The lake breeze was light. It occasionally blew her cloak, revealing the Flower Rope wrapped around her ankles. The boatmen were all busy; no one paid attention.

Gradually, a "buzzing" sound was heard. An island drew closer. Fu Dachun walked over. "Mr... Mr. Hua, please apply the bee-repellent ointment to avoid being stung by the bees."

Li Xian nodded. He applied the ointment to his cuffs and neck. Then, he sent Fu Dachun and the others away, opened Nan Gong Liuli's cloak, and helped her apply the ointment all over. Nan Gong Liuli didn't know whether to be angry or annoyed. She spat twice and gave up.

The boat docked. The scent of flowers was already in the air. Fu Dachun brought the horse over. Li Xian held Nan Gong Liuli and gently lifted her onto the horse's back, where she sat sideways. Although Nan Gong Liuli couldn't circulate her internal Qi, her foundation was still there, so it was easy for her to sit steadily on the horse's back.

Li Xian held the reins and inspected the apiary. Fu Dachun introduced it from the side.

The cultivated bee species was called "Vermilion Bee." Honey was the main product. The production of honey depended on the environment. Bees "collect" rather than "produce." Therefore, in the apiary, they planted "Fragrant Crisp Flowers" and "Oil番 Flowers"... and fruit trees like "Lychee Trees" and "Longan Trees."

As "nectar sources."

The island was about three thousand acres, with nearly five hundred beehives inside. One beehive could produce "thirty catties" of honey. The monthly production was over fifteen hundred catties, and selling it externally would yield about a thousand taels of silver.

There was a pavilion on the bee island where the accounts of previous years were recorded. Li Xian browsed the accounts and felt his heart pound. He carefully sorted out the profits and losses. After accounting for the beekeepers' living expenses, shipping losses, and other expenses, the monthly income was about nine hundred taels.

Li Xian sighed: "Although it doesn't compare to Madam Wen's industries, being able to earn a thousand taels a month is extraordinary!" He had inquired about [Essence Treasure] beast meat. A single cauldron烧炭 (burning charcoal) cost at least three thousand taels of silver, and at most five thousand taels. The beast meat was actually cheaper; charcoal, water, renting the treasure cauldron, and labor were the most expensive.

In the Flower Cage Sect, cooking essence food was presided over by elders. The elders had to spend money to start the cauldron and burn money to cook. They first took their share of the Essence Treasure, and the remaining essence meat and soup were distributed to the disciples. Therefore, every elder had many Flower Cage Sect disciples serving them attentively.

After the elder started the cauldron and cooked the essence food, the sect would reward 'one tael of merit silver'. Although starting the cauldron to cook was for martial arts cultivation, benefiting the sect's disciples was also considered a merit.

"With this apiary, I can accumulate money. Every few months, I will have the ability to start the cauldron! So this is how the Flower Cage Sect operates."

He was very happy and wandered around the apiary. Nan Gong Liuli was also surprised. Aristocratic families didn't need to worry about essence food, but she naturally understood the value of money. The Nan Gong family was wealthy, with countless riches, but maintaining the family's operations also required huge funds. Nan Gong Liuli was very good at business. Cooperating sincerely with Li Xian, without distinction between them, she occasionally obtained an apiary and her mind became active, thinking about how to use it.

The honey produced here was called 'Moist Crisp Honey', mainly sold in 'Sword City' and 'Wanghu City'. The sales were stable and favored by aristocratic families. Since Li Xian had taken over the industry, he naturally had to plan for future sales. Only by exchanging it for gold and silver in hand could it be considered valuable.

Li Xian asked, "Liuli, what do you think?" Nan Gong Liuli smiled. "A great bargain!"

The Vermilion Bees were very active, buzzing. Li Xian reached out to catch one, gently stroked it, and let it go back to the swarm. After viewing this apiary, they boarded the boat again and headed to the next island. The weather was very hot. It was past noon, and the heat waves surged back. Nan Gong Liuli wore a cloak. Although it hid her embarrassment, she felt very闷热 (stiflingly hot). Sweat could be seen on her forehead and neck.

The second bee island was much smaller, only about a thousand acres, with about a hundred beehives. They cultivated 'Golden Jade Bees', which were golden in color. Nan Gong Liuli was surprised. "This kind of bee is extraordinary. It's rumored to be 'flying gold'!"

The Golden Jade Bees lay on 'leaves'. Their bodies were plump. The island was very quiet, completely without the buzzing of the Vermilion Bee island. The Golden Jade Bee was as precious as gold and jade. The bee's nature was lazy and picky, and the nectar collection efficiency was very slow. But honey collected by this bee was as precious as golden oil!

In the Golden Jade Island, they planted two types of flowers: 'Honey Fragrance Flower' and 'Golden Green Flower'. The Golden Jade Bees collected nectar, producing the luxury item 'Golden Embryo Jade Nectar'. It had once been a tribute, costing two hundred taels per pot!

Li Xian checked the accounts. He couldn't help but be disappointed. The 'Golden Embryo Jade Nectar' yield was very low. Sometimes there was no production for months, sometimes only a few catties a month. In terms of cash flow, it was inferior to the Vermilion Bee island. But it was Tong Sannian's lifeblood.

Nan Gong Liuli told Li Xian that if this apiary was closed down, selling the Golden Jade Bees would also fetch a good price. If there was a way to eliminate the laziness of the Golden Jade Bees, the flow of funds would be even more endless.

After viewing these places, it was already evening. Fu Dachun reported that Tong Sannian had died suddenly, and the apiary had accumulated two months' worth of honey. Li Xian was very happy and decided to plan for external sales.

After viewing the two apiaries, there was still an orchard left. The orchard cultivated 'Azure Water Grapes', which were delicious in color and taste. They were mainly sold to 'Jade City' and were also luxury fruits. But the fruit ripens in April and May. When Tong Sannian was alive, they had already been sold to Jade City. In the short term, the orchard would not produce profits.

After viewing all the industries, Li Xian took the boat back. He saw the setting sun, golden light soaking the water and sky, a single color of lake scenery. Li Xian was in a very good mood, but Nan Gong Liuli suffered. Standing until her legs were sore and numb, sweating profusely under her cloak. She had no choice but to endure the hardship.

Suddenly, in Dongran Lake, four small boats drifted. Each boat held a fisherman, wearing a bamboo hat and a raincoat. The fishing lines were immersed in the lake, seemingly fishing for lake fish. Li Xian didn't pay much attention, but as the boat traveled for a while, he sensed that the four small boats were slowly circling his boat, their aura faintly locking onto this location.

One fisherman raised his arm. The hook leaped out of the lake surface. He reached out and grabbed it, looking at the empty hook. He shook his head and sighed. "I've been fishing all day, why haven't I caught a fish yet?"

He stirred his internal Qi again and threw the hook far away. The silver fishing line划过 (drew) a silver arc, coming with great force. This hook struck the boat Li Xian was on, hooking a crew member who was rowing. With a "噗嗤" sound, blood splattered. The hook pierced the flesh and drew a bloody wound. The crew member cried out in pain, shouting, "Ouch, you..."

Before he could finish, the fisherman held the fishing rod and waved it hard. The hook went deep into the flesh, hooked onto the bone, and pulled the crew member into the lake.

Blood stained the water. The fisherman pretended not to know and laughed. "Great, after fishing all day, I've finally caught a big fish." He twisted his waist but didn't hurry to reel in the line. Instead, he swung the crew member back and forth.

Li Xian looked around and knew the visitors were not friendly. He still had a Flower Rope on him. He immediately threw it out, striking the fishing line. He secretly vibrated his internal Qi, breaking the line.

Li Xian used the Flower Rope as a "whip" and threw it out again. He wrapped it around the crew member's waist and was about to pull him back into the boat. Suddenly, a "whoosh" sound was heard. Another fishing hook had also attacked, tangling with his Flower Rope. The hook bit into the rope, the fishing line tightened, and it tugged with him.

Then a "shoo" sound was heard. A third fishing hook flew over and also wrapped around the Flower Rope. The two forces, one east and one west, joined forces to resist Li Xian.

Nan Gong Liuli suddenly said, "Hua Wucuo!"

A fourth fishing line secretly hooked over, avoiding their line of sight, and attacked Nan Gong Liuli. Nan Gong Liuli felt the aura lock on her and knew it was bad. Seeing the flying hook coming, she was bound and unable to move or dodge. In her haste, she could only call out to Li Xian.

Li Xian's dual pupils had keen eyesight, observing in detail. He had already sensed the sneak attack. This act had angered him. He raised a finger and夹住 (clamped) the fishing hook. He shouted, "What petty thief is this, playing tricks here!" He secretly applied the 'Gang Thunder Finger' to his fingers, and the finger force was transmitted through the fishing line. The fisherman felt as if struck by lightning,咚一声 (with a thud) vomiting blood.

Li Xian stomped his right foot. With a "crack," the deck broke, and the boat shook. This force passed through the bottom of the boat and into the lake surface. Instantly, waves rose and surged towards the surrounding small boats. Li Xian then pulled hard.

The two fishermen's small boats were affected by the waves. They were just focusing on stabilizing their footing when they felt a terrifying aura. This internal Qi and pure physical strength were terrifyingly powerful!

Suddenly, they felt a huge force coming. When they came to their senses, their bodies were already flying through the air. Li Xian leaped up, his hands reaching out swiftly, grabbing the two men by their necks, and throwing them onto the deck.

The two fishermen were惊魂未定 (still frightened), their eyes full of horror. Li Xian said, "What petty thief dares to attack me?"

"Senior Hua, spare us, spare us. We were fishing, we didn't mean to disturb you." The fishermen untied their raincoats and bamboo hats, revealing their faces, and hurriedly begged for mercy in panic.

Li Xian heard the words "Senior Hua" and knew these people were specifically here for him. He asked, "Who sent you?"

The fisherman smiled ingratiatingly. "Senior Hua, what are you saying? We're just fishing. Do we need someone to send us?"

Li Xian sneered. "Good. Since you like fishing so much, I recommend a good place. Will you go there to fish?" The fisherman hurriedly said, "No, no, it's getting late. We should go back."

Li Xian said, "I know a place where the water is rich and the fish are fat. You catch the most at night. Since you like it so much, you will definitely like to go there." He immediately broke the手脚 (hands and feet) of the two men and threw them back into the small boat. Then, he used his Qi to strike a palm, raising waves and pushing the two men far into the depths of the lake.

The Dongran Lake was vast, and the terrain around the Water Altar was unique. Floating so far away, they might not have a way to survive. The two men cried out in terror, wailing and begging. Li Xian turned around calmly and boarded the shore by boat.

The original story was...

Flower Cage Sect elder An Weicheng had been eyeing the "apiary" and "orchard," but they ended up in Li Xian's hands. He felt secretly dissatisfied but didn't dare to show himself to target Li Xian. So he sent a few disciples to pretend to be fishing along the way and test Li Xian's skills.

He observed secretly and saw that Li Xian's skills were indeed not weak. He remembered an internal rumor: Chief Envoy Shi valued this boy very much.

The Flower Cage Sect had been散漫 (disorganized) for a long time. On the surface, it needed a few decent representatives. This time, they were focusing on cultivating him, wanting to help him build momentum and promote his name.

The Jianghu was about to have another famous "Great Flower Thief."

How many women would be shouting to kill him?

Regardless of others, Lady Broken Sword would definitely be the first to bear the brunt.
