# Chapter 338: Undercurrents Surging

Chen Wei’s heart sank heavily as he calculated the odds.

He secretly estimated that with Xu Yunfan’s terrifying physical strength, he wouldn't be able to withstand more than three strikes of the mace before being smashed into a pile of meat paste.

What was even more frightening was that while the other man's figure didn't look as massive as a mountain, his every movement carried an imposing, towering aura. This kind of physical cultivation, which had returned to its original simplicity, was truly shocking.

Xu Yunfan let out a long breath and took a Qi-Replenishing Pill, a secret creation of the Dao Sect, from his chest, swallowing it in one go.

The pill entered his stomach and immediately transformed into surging heat waves that spread through his blood and energy. Instantly, his blood and energy surged like a tide. As the Ten Extremes True Qi circulated, it rapidly converted into pure true energy to replenish his losses.

Before the Qi-Replenishing Pill in Xu Yunfan’s throat had even fully dissolved, a dense mist suddenly gathered above the Xuanwu Arena.

The earth veins of Yujing City roared. The Xuanhuang Qi, previously drawn in by the Dao Sect’s Grand Rite of the Heavenly Canopy, once again descended, pouring into Xu Yunfan's entire body like a celestial river flowing in reverse.

Winning another match meant further eroding the Great Zhou’s Dragon Vein Xuanhuang Qi.

The Xuanhuang Qi accumulated by the Great Zhou over its eight hundred years of foundation was now being forcibly stripped away by the "Kan-Li Dragon Transformation Formation" set up earlier, transforming into nine serpentine dragon shadows that coiled around Xu Yunfan’s body.

His exposed skin took on a jade-like luster, and the muscles and tendons beneath his skin bulged and writhed like earth veins. The Jade Marrow Golden Bones, perfected by the *Scripture of Marrow Cleansing*, were actually refined once more, producing sounds of gold and jade striking against each other as his bones moved.

The Ten Extremes True Qi flowing through his organs grew stronger under the scouring of the Xuanhuang Qi. Every time the true energy circulated, the air within a radius of ten zhang twisted.

*Crack!*

The obsidian擂台 (arena stage) beneath Xu Yunfan’s feet fractured and shattered under the true energy that he unconsciously leaked out.

Chen Wei’s pupils constricted, and his eyes nearly split from rage.

He clearly saw that the shattered stones were ground into fine powder by an invisible force before they could even hit the ground. Even more terrifying was Xu Yunfan’s breathing. With every exhale and inhale, the white mist spurting from his nostrils pierced through a flagpole three zhang away like a sword light. The thunderous rumble rolling in his chest was like a muffled drum, making people’s hearts tremble with fear.

"Can the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining truly reach such a height? Can the interaction between Heaven and Man really create such a terrifying, ocean-like aura!"

Chen Wei’s knuckles gripping the mace turned white.

He had苦修 (bitterly cultivated) the *Ten Thousand Chariots Coiling Dragon Spear* for forty years, reputed to be "divine with the spear," yet at this moment, he couldn't even get within three zhang of Xu Yunfan without his organs feeling pierced by pain.

A dead silence fell over the audience.

On the viewing platform, a group of Imperial Observatory officials and many elderly eunuchs stared with furious eyes at this scene, yet they couldn't move a single muscle.

He has become stronger again.

Xu Yunfan raised his hand, feeling the mist-like Ten Extremes True Qi within his body growing even denser. Even between his flesh and skin membranes, wisps of true energy were flowing.

His flesh and blood, nourished by the Ten Extremes True Qi, were becoming increasingly extraordinary.

Once his aura stabilized slightly, he turned his head to look at the old steward, who was already stunned into a daze. His tone was calm but brooked no argument: "Continue to the next round."

It must be known that there were still three rounds of matches remaining. Once matters here were concluded, everyone could proceed directly to the palace hall for the final martial performance.

At that time, the Empress would naturally attend in person to observe the ultimate winner of the Imperial Martial Selection.

The old steward fell silent for a moment, composing himself before speaking. "We will only have one match today. For the next three days, there will be one round per day."

The old steward fell silent for a moment, barely suppressing the shock in his heart. His thin, bony fingers trembled slightly as he sorted through the roster on the table, his hoarse voice revealing a hint of lingering fear.

"Today, everyone will only fight one match. For the next three days, there will be one round per day. The擂台 (arena) opens at the hour of Chen (7-9 AM), and no one will be admitted after that."

His turbid gaze swept over the crowd, lingering particularly on Xu Yunfan.

The terrifying strength displayed by this true disciple of the Dao Sect had completely derailed this martial performance from its intended course.

According to the regulations of the Six Ministries, three rounds were supposed to be fought today to proceed directly to the palace, but now, undercurrents were surging among various factions. Even this old official who had served through three dynasties felt his heart quivering.

"If you win three consecutive matches, you will naturally be able to perform before the palace and receive the Empress's favor."

"Receive the Empress's favor..."

Xu Yunfan didn't say much, a sneer flashing across his face.

By then, it would be questionable whether the Empress could still sit安稳 (stably) on the Dragon Throne.

The old steward slammed the register shut heavily, the turtle-shell-like wrinkles on his face hiding indescribable worry.

This delayed schedule was both a breathing opportunity for the various sects and a chance for the Empress sitting in the ninefold palace to arrange her strategy?

And the figure standing like an abyss or a mountain in the arena had already become the eye of the storm stirring up the winds and clouds of Yujing City.

Atop the Clear Weary Mountain Peak, on the Grand Rite Altar.

At the peak of Clear Weary Mountain, the vital energy was as sharp as blades. On the Grand Rite Altar, seventy-two ancient bronze lamps were arranged according to the constellations of the周天 (Universe), their wicks burning the Dao Sect's secret transmission "Dragon Blood Condensed Fat," the blue-purple flames standing firm in the howling wind.

Bi Yuan wore a dark-colored ritual robe, the cuffs embroidered with the cloud seal talismans hidden within the Daoist sect.

He stepped according to the Yu Bu (Yu Step), and with every step he took, the spiritual energy of the surrounding heaven and earth gathered like a whale swallowing, and a red array pattern appeared beneath his feet.

Bi Yuan pinched the Zi-Wu诀 (Zi-Wu Seal) with his left hand and held a Nine-Joint Peachwood Sword in his right, lifting a cinnabar talisman. The paper burned on its own without wind, turning into a fire dragon that spiraled upwards.

He pointed the sword tip at the "Kan-Li Cauldron" in the center of the altar. The energy inside churned like boiling water, constantly sending wave-like auras down below Clear Weary Mountain. As the earth veins oscillated, they echoed with the earth veins of Yujing City at an unimaginable speed.

Bi Yuan chanted incantations continuously, followed by a spell: "Heaven and Earth share the furnace, Creation acts as the craftsman; Kan and Li intersect, the Dragon Vein returns to its origin!"

With the terrifying strength of a Grandmaster of the Ninth Realm of Supreme Qi Refining, his voice rang out like thunder. The clouds at the peak suddenly split open, and the thirty-six peaks abruptly emitted green light, fusing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to shoot straight into the heavens. Then, starlight poured down into the cauldron, nurturing a mouthful of earth vein Xuanhuang Qi.

Eighty-one Black Iron Array Flags around the altar rustled and swayed, the flag surfaces revealing the mountain and river veins of the seventy-nine states of the Great Zhou.

Bi Yuan bit the tip of his finger, using his blood as ink to draw talismans in the void. With every stroke he put down, a rumbling of earth veins came from the direction of Yujing City.

The long-browed old Taoist beside him couldn't help but speak up upon seeing this: "Bi Yuan, you must be careful. The last time this true Grand Rite of the Heavenly Canopy was used was two thousand years ago. Although the spiritual energy of heaven and earth has been stirred up by the earth veins and recovered somewhat, we must still be cautious when following the old method."

"Don't worry, Master Uncle. I have practiced this talisman for thirty years."

After replying, Bi Yuan's eyes turned jade-colored, peering into the flow of earth energy.

He saw that below the Xuanwu Arena where Xu Yunfan was located, a Xuanhuang Qi as thick as a palace pillar was being forcibly extracted, rushing along the earth vein meridians toward Clear Weary Mountain.

Sensing this step, Bi Yuan's expression relaxed slightly, naturally understanding that Xu Yunfan had won another match.

Once he won three matches, the situation would be settled. The Empress would have no chance of turning the tables. Li Haomiao could take the opportunity to rise and reshape the world, and Xu Yunfan could also take a step forward借此 (借此), finding the opportunity to break through the Ninth Realm and enter the Land of Immortals.

Bi Yuan suddenly plunged the peachwood sword into the cauldron, and the Xuanhuang Qi inside turned into nine small dragons roaring and struggling.

He flew nine jade nails from his sleeve, the tails of which were carved with ancient seal scripts such as "Suppressing Mountains" and "Locking Seas," and they pierced into the foreheads of the small dragons one by one.
