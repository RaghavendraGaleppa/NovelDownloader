# Chapter 152: Pill Consumption and Cultivation, White Flame Market!

Seven days later, a streak of light descended from the horizon, landing swiftly on an island covered in a vast, verdant bamboo forest.

"The Great King has returned!"

"Quick, quick! Bring the freshly picked 'Bamboo Heart Tea' for the Great King!"

"And the 'Purple Cloud Fruits'—they're perfect for relieving fatigue. Hurry and deliver them to the Great King!"

As the streak of light touched down, the minor demons on the island sprang into action. Led by an elderly turtle, several peach blossom spirits, already transformed into beautiful humanoid forms, carried jade trays bearing spiritual tea and purple fruits to the entrance of a cave dwelling nestled in the rocky cliffs.

Outside the cave, newly placed formation flags shimmered faintly, setting up a simple yet effective invisible barrier that securely protected the dwelling. Sensing the arrival of the minor demons, the barrier parted slightly, revealing a narrow passage. The peach blossom spirits hurried in with their offerings, then swiftly retreated.

Inside the cave, Gu Yuan took a sip of tea and ate a purple fruit, his agitated mood finally calming somewhat.

"That Greenwater Fire-Eye Ape's methods are truly ruthless—to think it could teleport someone so far away…"

Recalling the intelligence he had gathered over the past seven days at the Flying Fish Market, Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh.

This place was the Western Sea Domain, within the Ten Thousand Islands Sea region, separated from the Southern Mountain Domain by tens of thousands of miles. Even a Golden Core cultivator, flying at full speed, would need an incalculable amount of time to traverse such a vast expanse.

At his current cultivation level, Gu Yuan had only one way to return to the Southern Mountain Domain: spatial teleportation. Only the instantaneous displacement across countless miles offered by spatial power would allow him to return to the Dao Academy within his lifetime. Otherwise, the journey alone would consume his remaining lifespan.

The Ten Thousand Islands Sea was a peculiar place—a "forbidden paradise" within the Western Sea Domain. Surrounding this sea was an eternal, unyielding storm of terrifying thunder that had persisted for millennia, enveloping a vast, immeasurable expanse of ocean. Within this thunderstorm, countless bolts of lightning crackled endlessly, capable of even felling Golden Core cultivators who ventured too close.

The only way to cross this thunderstorm was to wait for the once-every-fifty-years "Awakening Year." During this year, the thunderous power within the storm would gradually dissipate, revealing numerous passageways that allowed cultivators to leave the Ten Thousand Islands Sea and return to the mainland of the Western Sea Domain. Only on this mainland could one find the means for spatial teleportation.

And the next Awakening Year was still a decade away.

This meant Gu Yuan would have to remain in the Ten Thousand Islands Sea for at least ten full years.

"Ten years—neither short nor long. But now, at this critical juncture in my cultivation, losing the support of the Dao Academy is inconvenient…"

Gu Yuan sighed inwardly.

Having cultivated in the Dao Academy for several years, he had gained numerous opportunities, commanded the service of six Foundation Establishment cultivators, and even established connections with a Golden Core elder. Everything should have been smooth sailing, yet this sudden teleportation had forced him to start over from scratch.

This left him with a lingering sense of frustration.

The Foundation Establishment subordinates, the spiritual islands, and the ley lines—all these were expendable to Gu Yuan, mere aids to enhance his path. But the opportunities tied to the Sword Fox Elder were precious treasures, and losing them was a bitter pill to swallow.

Yet, what was done was done. He had no choice but to accept it.

The path of cultivation was fraught with obstacles, and losing his foundation in the Dao Academy was something he could endure.

"But… without a Golden Core expert to guide me, should I cultivate the Six Ren Method Pill Golden Scripture or not?"

Gu Yuan retrieved a radiant golden tome and a demon core crackling with lightning, his expression pensive.

From the Southern Mountain Domain to the Western Sea Domain, Gu Yuan had engaged in numerous battles without a single defeat. He could confidently claim his combat prowess was formidable—after all, he cultivated three methods simultaneously and had encountered countless opportunities.

His only concern was his cultivation speed.

Cultivating three methods at once granted him vast reserves of spiritual power, far surpassing his peers, and made him resistant to many esoteric techniques. However, accumulating spiritual energy and breaking through to higher realms had become significantly more difficult. Though he had reached the early Foundation Establishment stage some time ago, the spiritual power in his dantian showed no signs of increasing.

Seeing the small to know the great, Gu Yuan refused to wait until his lifespan was nearly exhausted before seeking ways to enhance his cultivation. He had to prepare now.

Now, he faced two paths. The first was to rely on medicinal pills, using their power to gradually increase his cultivation and accumulate spiritual energy.

The second was to cultivate the Six Ren Method Pill Golden Scripture, combining two methods to accelerate his progress.

Yet, the Six Ren Method Pill Golden Scripture carried an air of mystery that left Gu Yuan uneasy.

Previously, slaying the White Worm and seizing its demon core had merely been a contingency plan.

"For now, I'll focus on pill consumption for cultivation. I'll test its effects first. Besides, the Stone Liquid will condense again soon…"

After some deliberation, Gu Yuan decided to prioritize pill-based cultivation.

Over the past few weeks, he had frequented the Flying Fish Market for two purposes: first, to gather intelligence about his current location and explore ways to return to the Southern Mountain Domain; second, to sell the remains of the White Worm and other demon beasts from the Scarlet Moon Great River, using the proceeds to purchase cultivation-enhancing pills.

---

At present, he possessed six or seven different types of pills to aid his cultivation.

With a flick of his wrist, a crimson pill landed in his palm, which he promptly swallowed before resuming his cultivation.

……

……

For a cultivator, no matter the circumstances, the most important task was always cultivation.

Only through relentless practice could one glimpse the grand path.

Though Gu Yuan had been abruptly teleported to the Western Sea Domain, catching him off guard, he quickly adapted by seizing a spiritual site and continuing his cultivation.

This period of cultivation lasted two months.

Two months later, Gu Yuan looked at the empty pill bottles at his feet and the slight increase in spiritual power within his dantian, sighing once more.

After consuming a small portion of "Channel-Cleansing Spring" to purge the faint traces of pill toxins, he retrieved the golden tome again.

"I was too naive…"

"Simultaneously cultivating three methods is immensely difficult. It's no longer a matter of choosing between pills and techniques—to accelerate my progress, I need both!"

Gazing at the shimmering golden scripture, Gu Yuan sighed inwardly.

He had already tested the pill method, and while it provided some benefit, it wasn't enough. Relying solely on pills to reach mid-Foundation Establishment would take decades, not to mention the cost and the issue of pill toxins.

As for advancing to late-Foundation Establishment, that would take even longer. The further one progressed in cultivation, the less effective pills became. Without the aid of thousand- or even ten-thousand-year-old spiritual herbs, breakthroughs would be nearly impossible.

"I didn't want to take this path, but after two months and two uses of the Stone Liquid, I've yet to see any opportunities. I can't afford to wait any longer."

"I'll head to the White Flame Market to gather materials for the Method Pill and relocate to another place to test the Stone Liquid once more. If that still yields nothing, I'll have no choice but to begin cultivating this method."

After a long deliberation, Gu Yuan finally made his decision.
