# Chapter 249: Breakthrough  

Xiao Ke desperately wanted to speak. He had prepared a string of excuses and planned to embellish them with accusations of Li Shiming's unreasonable behavior, hoping Elder Zheng would trust him, a true disciple of the sect, more.  

But he couldn't utter a word. In his spiritual lake, a sword intent had taken root—a lightning-infused sword intent that darted chaotically, periodically striking at the lake's foundation.  

The spiritual lake was the core of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Any disturbance there could damage their foundation. Now, with the lightning sword intent wreaking havoc, Xiao Ke had to devote all his focus to suppressing it. If he diverted his attention to speak, he feared his spiritual lake would suffer irreparable damage.  

"Li Shiming—ah, I remember now. You're the high-level alchemist from the Shu Mountain Sect! My sect's disciple has offended you—my apologies!" Elder Zheng suddenly recalled Li Shiming's identity, his face breaking into a warm smile.  

Li Shiming's reputation had soared over the past year. Even a Golden Core elder like Zheng had heard of him.  

Whenever Li Shiming crafted pills, they were invariably high-grade. Moreover, his output was staggering—he could mass-produce second-grade spiritual pills, a feat exceedingly rare among alchemists.  

Typically, only those who refined pills one tier below their own alchemical mastery could achieve such quantities. To mass-produce pills at their own level marked them as prodigious talents in alchemy.  

"Elder Zheng, this was merely a trivial matter. I must thank you for handling it impartially," Li Shiming said with a respectful bow.  

Elder Zheng nodded approvingly, pleased by Li Shiming's humility. His gaze then shifted to Xiao Ke, now filled with disdain. The truth of the matter was already clear.  

Yin Shilan also thanked Elder Zheng before leading Li Shiming past the sect gates.  

As a true disciple specializing in formations, Yin Shilan had her own mountain within the sect—a privilege granted to all true disciples.  

After their departure, Elder Zheng prepared to leave but noticed Xiao Ke still frozen in place, clearly injured.  

Had Xiao Ke's flight technique not been active, his inability to channel spiritual energy would have sent him plummeting from the sky.  

Elder Zheng approached and probed Xiao Ke's condition with his divine sense, quickly identifying the sword intent lodged in his spiritual lake.  

"Return to your master. Have him remove the sword intent. If he can't, tell him to seek out Li Shiming," Elder Zheng advised with a resigned shake of his head.  

Li Shiming's sword intent wasn't overwhelmingly powerful, but it was extraordinarily refined and imbued with lightning—a combination that gave even Elder Zheng a headache.  

Extracting the sword intent from Xiao Ke's spiritual lake was perilous. The lake was fragile; a single misstep could cause it to collapse, shattering Xiao Ke's foundation and ending his path to immortality.  

Sword cultivators' intents were uniquely persistent. Once embedded, they could endure indefinitely in a spiritual environment, especially within a cultivator's spiritual lake. There, the intent would both damage and replenish itself by absorbing spiritual energy.  

Unless removed, the sword intent would torment Xiao Ke indefinitely. It wouldn't dissipate on its own—its endurance would outlast Xiao Ke's ability to withstand its ravages.  

Xiao Ke couldn't cultivate now. His spiritual lake was under constant assault, with the intent siphoning his spiritual energy. If his reserves dropped too low, his lake would collapse.  

Elder Zheng weighed the risks. His own intervention was too likely to fail, and failure would tarnish his reputation.  

Just then, Xiao Ke swayed, nearly falling.  

"Fine, I'll take you to your master," Elder Zheng sighed, using his divine sense to steady Xiao Ke.  

He wouldn't demean himself by approaching Li Shiming on Xiao Ke's behalf.  

A future grandmaster alchemist like Li Shiming was someone even Golden Core elders sought to befriend. Offending him over Xiao Ke wasn't worth it—especially given the vast network a grandmaster alchemist commanded.  

Meanwhile, Yin Shilan and Li Shiming flew through the Thousand Illusions Sect's mountain gates, soon arriving at her peak.  

"That's my master's cave abode, those are my three senior sisters', and this is mine," Yin Shilan explained as they traveled.  

The layout resembled the Shu Mountain Sect's: Golden Core elders occupied a mountain range, with the main peak reserved for the elder and surrounding peaks for their disciples.  

What caught Li Shiming's attention was the grand formation here—unlike any he'd encountered before.  

Mist swirled between the peaks, and cranes glided through the clouds. Yet, he sensed no life—the cranes were illusions, and likely the mist as well.  

Their flying vessel descended onto Yin Shilan's peak, where she led Li Shiming to a pavilion at the summit—her favorite solitary retreat, offering breathtaking views.  

"Truly a paradise," Li Shiming murmured, admiring the scenery, whether enhanced by the formation or naturally sublime.  

Delighted by his appreciation, Yin Shilan smiled. "My peak has a spiritual spring. Even my senior sisters often come to request some. Let me have some fetched to brew you a cup of spiritual tea."  

"I recently acquired some fine tea I've been saving. With the spring water, we can enjoy it together," Li Shiming replied, producing a jade box.  

The tea was a third-grade spiritual variety, a treasure typically reserved for Golden Core elders—something a Foundation Establishment cultivator would rarely encounter.  

Yin Shilan didn't refuse. Between them, sharing precious items only deepened their bond.  

But when Li Shiming opened the box, she gasped.  

"Third-grade spiritual tea!"  

Cultivators prized spiritual tea for its mental-enhancing properties. The finest teas rivaled top-tier elixirs, though their benefits diminished after the first tasting, making them ideal for esteemed guests.  

"Let me prepare it," Yin Shilan said, accepting the box as a maid brought the spring water.  

The maid glanced curiously at Li Shiming before quietly withdrawing.  

Unlike Li Shiming, unaccustomed to being served, Yin Shilan had grown up with every luxury. Her attendants were part of her life as a true disciple.  

Yin Shilan measured a single tea leaf into each jade cup with a bamboo spoon. The box held only a dozen leaves—enough for six or seven servings.  

This wasn't Ji Hongbo's personal stock. Even as a Golden Core elder's son, he wouldn't have been given such tea. It was part of the sect's resources, which Ji Hongbo had collected on his father's behalf—now fallen into Li Shiming's hands.  

As Yin Shilan brewed the tea with serene grace, Li Shiming watched, entranced, his heart at peace.  

"Shiming," Yin Shilan murmured, meeting his affectionate gaze with flushed cheeks as she handed him a cup.  

"Shi Lan, let's enjoy the tea," Li Shiming replied with a smile.  

The first sip sent his spiritual energy surging. The disguise of his cultivation realm, maintained by the "Phantom Demon Buddha Technique," shattered, revealing his near-peak mid-Foundation Establishment strength.  

He wasn't concerned about Yin Shilan noticing. The tea's energy flooded his spiritual lake, pushing him to the brink of breakthrough.  

Yin Shilan, at late-stage Foundation Establishment, also felt the tea's transformative power. Both sensed the imminent advancement.  

"To my cave abode!" Yin Shilan urged, suppressing her churning energy.  

Li Shiming, equally restrained, lifted her with his divine sense, summoning white lotuses to transport them swiftly to her cultivation chamber.  

Inside, the ambient spiritual energy was dense, amplified by Yin Shilan's formations.  

They began their breakthroughs in unison.  

Meanwhile, Yin Shilan's close friend and fellow disciple, Liang Yexuan, arrived at the peak.  

Accustomed to visiting freely, she frowned upon finding the pavilion empty, the cups of tea still warm.  

"Drinking such fine tea without me?" she huffed, more hurt than angry.  

Her search for Yin Shilan proved fruitless—even the maid was absent.  

Pouting, she marched to Yin Shilan's cave abode and knocked. Receiving no reply, she planted herself outside, determined to wait for an explanation.  

Inside the cultivation chamber, Li Shiming opened his eyes to find Yin Shilan gazing at him.  

"You've reached late Foundation Establishment already—so fast!" she marveled.  

Having witnessed his meteoric rise from their days in the Tianhai Sect, she wasn't surprised.  

"I prepared some elixirs to aid your cultivation," Li Shiming said, offering her a vial of ten top-grade "Shu Mountain Yellow Spirit Pills," tailored for mid-Foundation Establishment.  

He couldn't reveal more—his secret of the Machine Room Space had to remain hidden until they were strong enough to protect it.  

Ten pills were plausible—alchemists of his caliber could produce such quantities without raising suspicion.
