# Chapter 16: Celestial Origin Treasure Lotus  

The runes of *Body Nourishing Thunder* orbited the [Celestial Origin Treasure Lotus] like celestial stars, interconnected and forming a complete system.  

Pure primordial qi emanated from the [Celestial Origin Treasure Lotus], absorbed by the runes and transformed into Han Yue’s mana.  

According to *Body Nourishing Thunder*, a first-rank cultivator should condense thunder-nourishing runes in their dantian to accumulate lightning-based mana.  

Gathering seventy-two runes—the number of earthly fiends—marked a minor achievement.  

If a cultivator lacked further capability, they could use these seventy-two runes to form a core and advance to the second rank. However, such a core would be of inferior quality, at best yielding a low-grade golden core.  

Those with greater potential could continue refining runes until reaching the celestial number of three hundred and sixty-five, achieving a major completion.  

Forming a core at this stage ensured a solid foundation, guaranteeing at least a mid-grade golden core. Not only would their combat power double, but their chances of advancing to the third rank would also increase significantly.  

To achieve a supreme high-grade golden core, one had to continue condensing runes beyond the major completion and combine them with an advanced core-forming technique.  

In other words, Han Yue could now be considered a first-rank, Body Entry Realm grand completion cultivator!  

With a core-forming method, he could attempt to form his core and ascend to the second rank. However, Han Yue lacked such a technique and was far too ambitious to settle for an early, subpar breakthrough.  

Having just embarked on his cultivation path, Han Yue had long-term plans and unwavering confidence in himself!  

The [Celestial Origin Treasure Lotus] he had drawn was an incredibly profound resource-based divine ability. It generated primordial qi internally, providing Han Yue with an endless supply of pure energy to meet his cultivation needs.  

From now on, Han Yue would save countless hours and effort that would otherwise be spent seeking external resources.  

Upon careful observation, he found that even at its first rank, the [Celestial Origin Treasure Lotus] emitted primordial qi faster than Han Yue could absorb and refine demon beast flesh day and night. It was more than sufficient for his cultivation!  

Moreover, the [Celestial Origin Treasure Lotus] was bound to his cultivation realm and would advance alongside him, making its potential limitless!  

The mana of *Body Nourishing Thunder* circulated through his body, its abundant power gradually tempering his internal organs before moving to his meridians, bones, and flesh.  

This full-body refinement process left Han Yue aching all over.  

The impurities and foreign qi accumulated from consuming demon beast flesh were shattered by the thunder mana and expelled from his body.  

Black-brown sweat seeped from Han Yue’s pores, and he felt an unprecedented lightness in his organs. Even his sea of consciousness slowly expanded!  

Within his dantian, the three hundred and sixty-five runes vibrated, tirelessly converting the endless stream of primordial qi.  

As the qi was refined, another thunder-nourishing rune took form. Instead of remaining in his dantian, it flowed through his body along with his mana.  

Yet, neither physical refinement nor rune condensation could fully deplete the excess primordial qi.  

Han Yue ceased his cultivation and stood, stepping into the courtyard.  

Grasping the [Gengjin Blade Embryo], he began practicing a set of military-style saber techniques.  

At first, his movements were stiff, but they soon became fluid and natural.  

Within the confined space, he weaved back and forth, leaping and shifting with precision.  

Wind and mist swirled silently around him—his blade already contained the essence of the [Thoughtless Slash] divine ability.  

But Han Yue restrained the power, ensuring none of it escaped the blade.  

With each swing, the hilt felt as heavy as a mountain, yet the blade sliced through everything in its path.  

He cut through wind, dust, light, sound—even his own thoughts!  

Now, Han Yue could unleash the [Thoughtless Slash] without restraint, no longer burdened by hesitation.  

His mana surged to fuel the divine ability, and his mastery grew increasingly refined.  

Gradually, Han Yue’s mind fully immersed in the technique, devoid of any stray thoughts.  

Three days and nights passed before he emerged from this meditative state.  

The [Thoughtless Slash] had finally reached the threshold of true mastery!  

**[Divine Ability: Raiden Shogun’s Thoughtless Slash]**  
**[Quality: Epic (Purple)]**  
**[Proficiency: Mastery (1%)]**  
**[Key Trait: Severing]**  

Han Yue’s control over the [Thoughtless Slash] had entered a new realm, its power significantly enhanced!  

Upon inspecting himself, he found his mana mostly depleted but rapidly replenishing under the [Celestial Origin Treasure Lotus]’s nourishment.  

The divine ability’s rune had become more intricate, capable of storing ten times more thunder mana!  

His internal reservoir had expanded further, finally providing an outlet for the lotus’s boundless primordial qi.  

With this third divine ability, Han Yue’s overall strength had skyrocketed!  

Breakthroughs in offense, defense, and endurance had elevated his combat prowess to new heights.  

Recalling the mighty demons he had encountered on his journey, Han Yue now felt confident in facing them head-on.  

He left his quarters and found Old Yang in the courtyard.  

"Master Yang, I have a request," Han Yue said. "Do you have a map of the hunting grounds in our Butcher’s Guild? Are we allowed to freely hunt demon beasts?"  

Old Yang replied without hesitation, "Demon beasts are wild creatures—they don’t belong to the Butcher’s Guild. Of course, hunting them isn’t restricted!"  

"The so-called hunting zones are just for our own convenience, not enforced rules."  

"I have a map here. Our guild’s hunting grounds span the Heaven, Earth, Mystic, and Yellow Districts, extending no more than ten thousand li. It’s all marked."  

"At most, it’s two days’ ride on a fast horse—not too far!"  

"Beyond that lies an even vaster wilderness teeming with demon beasts!"  

Han Yue took the map, studied it briefly, and tucked it away.  

Next, he sought out Fang Yi, who was training in the courtyard.  

Clad in light practice attire, Fang Yi wielded a two-zhang-long metal greatsword with formidable momentum.  

"Guild Master, may I borrow your corpse storage pouch?" Han Yue asked.  

Without pausing his swings, Fang Yi replied, "It’s in my study. Ask Xiao Liu to fetch it for you!"  

After retrieving the pouch, Han Yue wasted no time and headed toward the forest.  

Brimming with primordial qi, he moved faster and faster, his figure flashing past bystanders.  

Soon, he was beyond the Butcher’s Guild’s borders.  

With a golden streak, he soared into the horizon!
