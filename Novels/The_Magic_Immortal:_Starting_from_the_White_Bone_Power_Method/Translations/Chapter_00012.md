# Chapter 12: Why Not Help Me Remove This Soft Armor?

Hearing his name called and noticing the visitor came from Courtyard One, Wang Chan immediately put away his jade book and stood up to respond, "Present."

"Physician Ning requires the assistance of a lower-grade physician skilled in rejuvenation and recovery. The compensation is one Fa Coin. Are you willing?"

One Fa Coin?

Wang Chan was surprised. Normally, for a physician of his level, thirty Spirit Beads would already be generous for such assistance. One Fa Coin was unusually high.

He didn't immediately agree, suspecting there might be hidden circumstances. His abilities were limited, and if the task exceeded them, it would be better to decline.

At the same time, many around him stood up, especially those also skilled in rejuvenation. Their gazes toward Wang Chan turned unfriendly. Among them, Fellow Daoist Tang, another tenant from Lotus Mountain, stood up indignantly and protested to the female cultivator with the long braid:

"Fellow Daoist Qi, I, Tang, am also skilled in restoring vitality and regulating Qi, with twenty-two layers of spell restrictions mastered. Why—"

The braided female cultivator gave Fellow Daoist Tang a disdainful look, crossed her arms, and said bluntly, "Your medical skills are indeed good, Fellow Daoist Tang, but the patient inside doesn't like ugly faces."

Fellow Daoist Tang: "..."

The other physicians: "..."

"...In that case, I humbly accept," Wang Chan replied, realizing the reason. Since Ning Jingming had specifically called for him, refusal wasn't an option unless he wanted to leave this place. Besides, Ning Jingming had always been upright and wouldn't likely set him up.

Moreover, in a way, this was his first day setting up shop here. After waiting half a day, he finally had his first customer—and for one Fa Coin at that. Refusing would be inauspicious.

Still, he had hoped to rely on his skills, but his face...

After packing up his stall, locking his thatched hut, and hanging a "Closed for the Day" sign, Wang Chan followed the braided female cultivator to Ning Jingming's courtyard.

Upon entering, two mid-stage Qi Refining female guards stood expressionlessly on either side of a room. A dark, ugly scholar stood under a spiritual date tree in the courtyard, hands clasped behind his back, staring solemnly at ants moving on the ground.

Under another spiritual date tree, a mid-stage Qi Refining male cultivator with uneven features touched the tree trunk as if it were a mirror, lost in thought and visibly frustrated.

Wang Chan recognized him—a middle-grade physician from Courtyard Five, renowned for his mastery of the middle-grade [Mystic Water Restoration Art], far superior to Wang Chan's [Spring Revival Cloud-Pushing Art].

Hearing Wang Chan's footsteps, the dark scholar turned and greeted him warmly, "Fellow Daoist Wang."

Wang Chan quickly returned the courtesy, "Fellow Daoist Ning summoned me. What are your instructions?"

Ning Jingming was concise, "I need to treat a guard, but her injuries are severe, her vitality is depleted, and her Qi is greatly damaged. Any drastic measures could worsen her condition, so I need your assistance in rejuvenation."

"At your service," Wang Chan said without further questions.

"Please!" Ning Jingming gestured for him to follow.

The two female guards at the door didn't stop him. Instead, they exchanged knowing smiles after giving Wang Chan a once-over.

"Fellow Daoist Ning, I told you, no rejuvenation is needed..." A weak yet stubborn voice came from behind a gauze curtain on a jade bed, where a woman in white soft armor lay with her eyes closed.

"Fellow Daoist Tian, your injuries are severe, and your vitality is weak. Without rejuvenation, any movement could leave lasting damage, affecting your cultivation," Ning Jingming persuaded. "Fellow Daoist Wang's medical skills are excellent..."

Truthfully, if there had been a female physician skilled in rejuvenation in his courtyard or nearby, the problem would have been solved long ago. But there weren't any.

Outside, there were two, but their spell or artifact restrictions didn't exceed six layers, making them useless. Yet the treatment couldn't be delayed further.

Fortunately, the two female guards outside had casually asked if there were any clean-looking male physicians skilled in rejuvenation. Ning Jingming immediately thought of Wang Chan.

Though Wang Chan's cultivation was low and his medical skills average, his character, appearance, and demeanor were impeccable—especially today, when he seemed even more impressive than usual.

"Fellow Daoist Wang or Li, it doesn't matter. I don't want just any man touching me..." The woman on the bed opened her eyes mid-sentence and, upon seeing Wang Chan in his blue robe, paused before saying, "Oh, it's Fellow Daoist Wang."

Ning Jingming's eyebrows rose slightly, a hint of a smile playing on his lips as if he'd found an opportunity. He lifted the gauze curtain.

"It's you?!" Wang Chan was surprised.

The woman on the jade bed was the beauty mark from yesterday's inspection! Yesterday, she had been alluring; today, she was pale and frail, evoking pity.

"So Fellow Daoist Tian and Fellow Daoist Wang are acquainted. Since you're friends, there's no need for formalities," Ning Jingming smoothly provided an out. "Rest assured, Fellow Daoist Tian, Fellow Daoist Wang's [Spring Revival Needles] are excellent and will surely help you."

"Since I'm familiar with Fellow Daoist Wang, I have no concerns," the beauty mark said, glancing at Wang Chan before lowering her eyes weakly. "I'm frail, so please be gentle with the needles, Fellow Daoist Wang."

"I'll do my best," Wang Chan said solemnly.

In truth, he was baffled...

Friends? Familiar? I don't even know your name.

They'd only met yesterday, and he'd nearly been arrested as a demonic cultivator.

...

Half an hour later, the treatment concluded smoothly.

As Ning Jingming and Wang Chan prepared to leave, the beauty mark said lazily, "My body feels stiff and cold. Does Fellow Daoist Ning have a remedy?"

"Sluggish Qi and stagnant blood are normal during recovery," Ning Jingming said reflexively before noticing her gaze was fixed on Wang Chan. "How about Fellow Daoist Wang performs a meridian massage to promote circulation..."

"My needles are quite potent. They were necessary for treatment, but now that the injury is stabilized, further stimulation isn't advisable," Wang Chan quickly declined.

Healing was a physician's duty, but post-treatment massages? He was a doctor, not a masseur.

"Doesn't Fellow Daoist Wang also have the gentle [Spring Revival Cloud-Pushing Art]?" Ning Jingming patted Wang Chan's shoulder while subtly rubbing his thumb and forefinger together—a clear signal for negotiation.

Seeing this, Wang Chan, a humble wilderness rogue cultivator, couldn't refuse. "If you don't mind my crude technique, I'll do my best."

Half an incense stick later, as Wang Chan strained to circulate her Qi through the soft armor, the beauty mark said, "This is too taxing. Just press directly."

It was indeed exhausting, so Wang Chan complied. Since the soft armor remained, there was no direct contact—no harm done.

After another incense stick, she added, "Your technique's restrictions are too low. The soft armor hinders you. Why not help me remove it?"

"No need. I can manage," Wang Chan refused without hesitation.

This beauty mark clearly had high status—otherwise, Ning Jingming wouldn't be so accommodating. With limited understanding between them and Wang Chan's own lack of strength, it was better to stay professional.

After the incident with Madam Cheng, Wang Chan had learned to be extra cautious around women.

The beauty mark didn't insist but fell silent. To ease the awkwardness, Wang Chan asked about her injury.

"While patrolling near Emerald Wave Pond, we encountered a lower-grade Jiaolong with high-tier bloodline. We tried to kill it, but it awakened a high-tier divine ability. My four subordinates died, and I barely escaped with a high-grade [Minor Earth Travel Talisman]..." Her expression darkened. "Once I recover, I'll gather allies and slay that beast!"

Just then, Ning Jingming's voice boomed from outside—"Fellow Daoist Bai!"

The door burst open, and a figure rushed in like the wind.
