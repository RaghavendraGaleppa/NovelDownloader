# Chapter 40: No Blame

Having just killed a man, Zhou Qing's mind was unexpectedly calm. After simply tidying up and dealing with the aftermath in his room, he went back to sleep.

When he woke again, the sky outside was still pitch black. In the lingering night, the morning star twinkled brightly in the heavens. At this hour, most scholars preparing for the imperial examinations were still asleep, but Zhou Qing was already fully alert.

Today's provincial examination would be the crucial step in establishing his foundation for a secure future—becoming an "Honorable Provincial Graduate." For most people in the world, this was the pinnacle of their lifelong pursuit of success.

Though this examination concerned Zhou Qing's "future prospects," his heart remained extraordinarily tranquil. Apart from martial training and sleep, he had spent most of his time studying. With his formidable memory and comprehension, he had dissected the structures, themes, and techniques of classic eight-legged essays down to their bones.

Talent was paramount in scholarship, especially for the imperial examinations. He wasn't aiming for the top honors—just the title of Provincial Graduate to establish himself in his hometown. After half a year of preparation, passing the exam was all but certain, barring unforeseen circumstances. And the only unforeseen circumstance had already been dealt with—by his own hands.

At that moment, Fuso, who had been meditating in the darkness, suddenly spoke:  
"Junior Brother, you've reached the stage of 'or leaping in the deep.' This endeavor will surely be 'without blame.' I congratulate you in advance."

The phrase "or leaping in the deep, without blame" came from the I Ching. Fuso's timing in quoting it was impeccable. The hexagram was divided into two parts: "or leaping in the deep" symbolized a dragon preparing to emerge from the depths, while "without blame" indicated that there would be no fault—success was imminent.

Zhou Qing particularly appreciated the word "or" in the phrase. The beauty of this line lay in its emphasis on personal agency. After killing Zhang Shen, whether Zhou Qing advanced or remained where he was, the outcome would be favorable. With the snake-like Zhang Shen dead, even if Old Master Zhang suspected Zhou Qing, the Zhang family now faced an insurmountable problem: Zhang Shen had been their sole heir.

With Zhang Shen gone, who would inherit the Zhang family's wealth? Would the marginalized branches of the family begin to stir? The specter of "devouring the heirless" loomed large—a fate that had driven Lin Tai, the Lin family patriarch, to move his assets to Jiangzhou years ago.

Of course, Zhang the Provincial Graduate might still seek vengeance against Zhou Qing with all his might. But Zhang Shen's earlier stance had been clear: Zhou Qing was to either die or become the Zhang family's dog. The bandits had come for Zhou Qing's life, and the two monks staying at the inn had been hired by Zhang Shen to prevent Zhou Qing from taking the exam.

The blade had already been at his throat. Killing Zhang Shen ensured that the worst outcome would still be better than before. "Without blame" was Fuso's auspicious blessing for Zhou Qing. Once he passed the exam, what could the Zhang family possibly do to him? On one side was a childless, aging gentry; on the other, a rising young Provincial Graduate. The powerful families of Jiangzhou would know which side to choose. Once Zhou Qing returned with his new title, the balance of power would shift.

What the Zhang family could do, he could do as well. As the saying went, "Where the enemy can go, I can go too."

Calm as still water, Zhou Qing replied, "Senior Brother, it is indeed time to be 'without blame.' Let us prepare to depart."

Before the provincial examination hall, the crowd surged ahead of Zhou Qing. They had set out early but arrived late. Fuso seemed to have aged suddenly, his face no longer as ruddy and vibrant as before.

"Senior Brother, thank you. Are you alright?" Zhou Qing recalled the dangers they had faced along the way. Zhang Shen's men had included not just the two monks from the Diamond Temple but also experts from the Fierce Tiger Gang and the Zhang family's own guards...

Fuso had tapped into his deepest reserves, harnessing his inner energy to escort Zhou Qing through. Another critical factor had been the discovery of Zhang Shen's death by his page. Chaos ensued, allowing Fuso and Zhou Qing to slip away—though Fuso had been left severely drained.

With a faint smile, Fuso said, "Junior Brother, don't worry about me. I just overexerted myself. Go take your exam now."

"Alright."

Seeing that Fuso seemed fine, Zhou Qing set aside his concerns. He handed his sword and crossbow to Fuso for safekeeping and picked up the bag containing his writing tools, inkstone, identification documents, and other examination necessities before heading to the examination grounds.

Only after watching Zhou Qing reach the gates of the examination hall did Fuso slump against the alley wall, gasping for breath as sweat poured from him like a river.

"By the Infinite Heavenly Lord, that nearly killed me."

Zhou Qing first went to the supply station next to the examination hall to collect candles and charcoal. Seated nearby was the supervising official, Magistrate Feng of Hengbo County under Changzhou's jurisdiction—a seventh-rank official. To Zhou Qing's surprise, the martial arts escort leader from the Distant Peace Escort Agency stood beside the magistrate. When Zhou Qing came to collect his supplies, the escort leader winked at him.

Zhou Qing nodded slightly in acknowledgment, though now was not the time for conversation. The escort leader didn't approach him either.

After Zhou Qing left, Magistrate Feng asked, "That young man just now—is he a fellow townsman of yours, Escort Leader Wu?"

The escort leader gave a concise account of their encounter on the road, omitting unnecessary details.

Magistrate Feng stroked his beard and smiled. "To remain so composed just days after encountering bandits—this young man has remarkable poise. He might soon see his name on the golden roll of successful candidates."

Magistrate Feng himself was a Provincial Graduate, having served only one term as county magistrate. For Provincial Graduates, promotion was far harder than for Metropolitan Graduates. Still, he had governed diligently and earned good evaluations. With the bandit heads brought by Escort Leader Wu, Magistrate Feng now had a chance to rise further.

Since the bandit incident involved Zhou Qing, Magistrate Feng felt an instinctive goodwill toward the composed and handsome young scholar. This goodwill grew when he learned that Zhou Qing had been named the top candidate in the preliminary exams by Vice Chief Examiner Lu, a Metropolitan Graduate who might soon be promoted again after serving as deputy examiner for this provincial exam.

Hengbo County was adjacent to Changzhou, and the Ten Thousand Blessings Inn fell under its jurisdiction. When a murder case emerged, the Zhang family bribed the constables to report to Magistrate Feng, who was serving as supervising official at the supply station.

Presented with the accusation, Magistrate Feng frowned. "You're claiming this Scholar Zhou is the murderer and want me to arrest him?"

"Yes," the Zhang family's page knelt and replied.

"Where is your evidence?" Magistrate Feng asked coldly.

"W-well, none yet... But my young master never offended anyone in Changzhou except Zhou Qing, who harbored resentment toward him. And they were staying at the same inn—who else could it be? Please investigate, Your Honor. This small token is for your trouble."

Magistrate Feng didn't even glance at the so-called "tea money." "Without evidence, you expect me to open a case? Do you take me for a fool?"

"My master is Provincial Graduate Zhang of Jiangzhou..." the page blurted out in panic.

Magistrate Feng cut him off. "I know only the words 'uphold justice and abide by the law.' Without evidence, this is slander. Guards! Take this man to the county jail. I suspect there's more to this case."

Arresting Zhou Qing was out of the question—he was already inside the examination hall, and Vice Chief Examiner Lu, who had overseen Zhou Qing's preliminary exam, might soon see him become a Provincial Graduate. Magistrate Feng had heard of Provincial Graduate Zhang—with his only son dead, what future did the Zhang family have? Regardless, the page would be jailed first. A murder case couldn't be left unresolved, and the page's shifty eyes suggested he might be the killer. Servants murdering their masters wasn't unheard of in Tiannan.

The page had never imagined that reporting the crime would land him in jail. The two Diamond Temple monks had suddenly grown cold, and the Fierce Tiger Gang members had already left for Jiangzhou. He had thought bribing the magistrate would help, but the man refused the money. Was he actually an honest official?

Already distraught over his master's death, the page collapsed in despair.

Later, the coroner's examination revealed that Zhang Shen had been poisoned by two different lethal substances. With no signs of struggle at the scene, the killer was likely someone close to him—making the page the prime suspect.

After queuing for inspection, Zhou Qing entered the examination hall and saw statues of ancient sages enshrined at the center. These sages had established scholarship, morality, and rituals, distinguishing humans from beasts. Their statues received reverence from many examinees. Zhou Qing's sharp senses detected an immense, righteous aura emanating from them, forming an invisible structure of "propriety" within the hall—a set of rules all must follow.

The examination grounds grew solemn. Once all candidates had assembled, the chief examiner for this special provincial exam, Song He—Military Commissioner of the Tiannan Circuit—arrived with his entourage. Vice Chief Examiner Lu stood close to him, accompanied by a martial monk whose bulging temples and intimidating aura marked him as a formidable fighter.

As Song He appeared before the candidates and officials, everyone bowed, making him the focal point of the hall. Commanding military authority over the entire circuit, Song He exuded an unshakable dominance. Even the formidable martial monk beside him paled in comparison.

Many examinees couldn't help but think, "A true man should be like this." This was what it meant to hold power. Their desire to pass the exam and become Provincial Graduates burned even brighter. With that title, their lives would change forever—this was the fabled "leaping of the dragon gate."

For Zhou Qing, attaining scholarly honors was essential, but his ultimate goal was to secure more resources for his cultivation. His aspirations differed from the others', yet his actions now aligned perfectly with theirs.

"Or leaping in the deep, without blame."  
It was time for him to emerge.
