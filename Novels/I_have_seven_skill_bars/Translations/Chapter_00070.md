# Chapter Seventy: You're Too Naive

So, early this morning, Dong Feng quickly finished his daily alchemy work, then eagerly took his small notebook and headed to the spirit field area.

"It was your provocation back then that spurred me to work harder and reach where I am today. I hope my provocation today can also inspire you to strive for more. However, from now on, you might only be able to watch my back as you slowly try to catch up..." Dong Feng thought to himself, looking at Ding Rui.

He hadn't come with any malicious intent this time, just to subtly showcase his current excellence and power in front of Ding Rui, and then leave, basking in Ding Rui's complex gaze, mixed with reverence, awe, longing, and admiration.

To sum it up, the saying, "Thirty years the river flows east, thirty years the river flows west; do not bully a young man in poverty," quite accurately reflected Dong Feng's long-held sentiments towards Ding Rui.

But what Dong Feng didn't expect was this: Ding Rui, his rival whom he had always considered a goal, determined to surpass, and constantly compared himself against to see who was stronger... at this moment, didn't even remember when he had met the person standing before him. After all, when Qing Yu spoke with Ding Rui previously, she hadn't revealed her relationship with Dong Feng. So, to Ding Rui, Dong Feng was merely a stranger, a cultivator he had met once. It was perfectly normal for him not to remember.

"Hmm, it's already quite difficult to just manage to retain your status as a spirit farmer after your first harvest. There's no need to belittle yourself. While most spirit farmers don't have high cultivation, you are indeed very useful to the sect. Your current focus should be on cultivating well, making these spirit fields yield more. Only then will we outer disciples have more cultivation resources and time for work, and we might even occasionally give you some benefits." Dong Feng spoke like an experienced veteran, completely seeing himself as Ding Rui's senior. And, of course, he was indeed Ding Rui's senior now.

He continued, "As for cultivation issues, you don't need to worry too much. In recent years, our Pill Hall has been developing a pill called Foundation Establishment Pill, which can help Qi Condensation cultivators quickly break through to the Foundation Establishment stage. I've had the fortune to participate in its creation and know that it will be successful soon."

In truth, Dong Feng merely had decent talent, allowing him to assist the cultivators creating the Foundation Establishment Pill. Most of his information was hearsay. However, this didn't stop him from showcasing his extraordinary nature in front of Ding Rui and subtly needling Ding Rui, who was still a Qi Condensation cultivator.

"Once we refine the Foundation Establishment Pill, even if your talents aren't enough to smoothly enter the Foundation Establishment stage, this pill will help you succeed." Although Dong Feng used "you all," there was no third person present, so it was clearly directed solely at Ding Rui. He wanted to see Ding Rui's shock and disbelief upon hearing about the Foundation Establishment Pill. After all, Foundation Establishment was such a distant goal for Ding Rui, who was still at the first level of Qi Condensation.

The sect had never expected a spirit farmer to propose something like Ding Rui's request. After all, cultivating Spirit Vein Flowers was no simple task; its planting difficulty was several times that of spirit rice, which was already a huge problem. Not to mention, within the entire sect's territory, only a handful of cultivators had previously grown Spirit Vein Flowers, and most of them were outer or inner disciples. Among all the spirit field cultivators, perhaps only Ding Rui had any planting experience. Under such circumstances, cultivating Spirit Vein Flowers, no one dared guarantee that problems wouldn't arise. So, even if only to avoid losing face or taking responsibility, the spirit field cultivators would always cooperate. If problems occurred, at least they would have companions to share the burden, which was infinitely better than fighting alone. Therefore, no one reminded Dong Feng whether a request like Ding Rui's could actually be approved; he simply felt that it couldn't.

"Why not?" Ding Rui asked, confused. "I can do it myself; I don't need help from other cultivators."

Dong Feng's face was filled with shock. Naturally, he wasn't shocked by Ding Rui's strength, but by Ding Rui's "arrogance"!
