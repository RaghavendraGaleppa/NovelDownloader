# Chapter 415: Refining Heavenly Gang and Capturing Earthly Evil

He pondered for a moment before his resolve hardened. It was time to pay a visit to the mountain.

The Arctic Heavenly Gang Qi struggled within Xu Yunfan's palm; each tremor caused the ice layer at the peak of the Ice Abyss to crack. He paid it no mind and immediately sat cross-legged in the center of the ice cave.

The Arctic Heavenly Gang Qi roared and struggled in his palm, each vibration causing starlight from the ice abyss's ceiling to rain down.

For a full three months, he remained as motionless as an ancient boulder. Gradually, a Dharma Form of a snake coiled around a tortoise appeared around him. The patterns on the玄龟 (Black Tortoise)'s shell aligned with the celestial stars, and every line flowed with stellar power. The scales of the冥蛇 (Nether Snake) shimmered with煞气 (Evil Qi) like molten rock, and as its pupils opened and closed, underground fires flickered.

Until the midnight of the third month, when the seven stars of the Big Dipper in the sky suddenly aligned.

Seven brilliant rays of starlight, like a river of stars pouring down, condensed into tangible silver-white chains that descended into the ice abyss. Each chain was entwined with ancient stellar runes. These starlight chains precisely pierced Xu Yunfan's seven major acupoints, dragging the struggling Arctic Heavenly Gang Qi inch by inch into the depths of his Dantian.

The ancient ice of the abyss ceiling refracted a seven-colored halo under the starlight. The white breath Xu Yunfan exhaled actually mingled with the starlight, condensing a miniature Black Tortoise star map around him.

When the seventy-ninth ray of starlight pierced his body, his spine suddenly erupted with a dragon-like roar. The golden bones of his great dragon spine lit up one by one with dark golden True Warrior inscriptions, as if an invisible giant hand were using the stars as a hammer, forging him into a humanoid divine weapon.

On the seventy-ninth day, dark clouds suddenly gathered over the ice abyss. Xu Yunfan's eyes snapped open, his pupils having turned into the vertical pupils of a Black Tortoise. The Heavenly Gang Qi finally let out a mournful cry. Under the relentless washing and suppression of his True Warrior Subduing Devil True Essence, it condensed within his chest and abdomen into the Demon-Suppressing Seal of the Black Tortoise Star Lord.

Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes; deep within his pupils, it seemed as if a snake was coiled around a tortoise. He lightly raised his right palm, and a thread of True Warrior Heavenly Gang with a dark black and gold texture leaped from his fingertips. In an instant, the temperature of the entire ice abyss plummeted.

"Sss!"

Wherever the Gang Qi passed, ten-thousand-year-old ancient ice silently melted, leaving a smooth, mirror-like surface. A ice pillar three zhang away suddenly revealed spiderweb-like cracks, then collapsed with a rumble. The shattered ice was ground into dust by the residual force before it could even hit the ground.

He flicked his finger lightly, and the Arctic Exorcising Demon Qi suddenly transformed into a three-inch small sword. The sword edge didn't move, yet the surrounding air spontaneously condensed into frost blades, carving thousands of intersecting sword marks into the ice walls within ten paces. What was even more astonishing was that starlight flowed within the ice cracks cut open by the sword, as if the sword intent carried the killing power of the Big Dipper.

"Boom!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly merged his fingers into a sword and pressed downward. A muffled thunder-like vibration came from the bottom of the ice abyss. The magma of the ninth layer of the Earth Vein Magma Prison was actually drawn from afar, forming a crimson vortex with a diameter of a hundred zhang beneath the ice layer. The Black Tortoise Dharma Form emerged from his back; the star patterns on the tortoise shell and the underground fire reflected each other, causing the entire North Xuan Ice Abyss to flicker in and out of view.

"Interesting..."

Xu Yunfan's eyes suddenly shone brightly, and starlight of a snake coiled around a tortoise seemed to flow deep within his pupils. He clearly felt the Arctic Exorcising Demon Qi in his body perfectly blending with the True Warrior Subduing Devil True Sutra, surging through his meridians like a river.

"At the Land Immortal Realm, I was already comparable to the Qi Refining Great Completion."

He clenched his five fingers into a虚握 (empty grip), and the dark black Gang Qi bursting from his palm instantly froze and then shattered an ice pillar ten zhang away. "Now that I have refined this True Warrior Heavenly Gang, I wonder what level I can reach..."

The power had more than doubled compared to before. If previously he was half a step into Foundation Building, now he had truly touched that threshold.

But then Xu Yunfan frowned slightly. Although the Demon-Suppressing Seal in his Dantian had taken shape, he felt as if something was missing. It was like a divine weapon that had not yet been sharpened, possessing form but lacking true intent.

"It still lacks some refinement. I still need the Subduing Demon Earthly Evil. I must go to the ninth layer of the Earth Vein Magma Prison to search for it..."

He muttered to himself, his gaze falling on the ice beneath his feet.

Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil are both rare treasures of heaven and earth. If it weren't for the fact that the True Warrior Subduing Devil True Sutra inherently connects to the two types of Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil of True Warrior Subduing Devil, it would be harder than ascending to heaven to find them personally. This is also why the True Sutra born in response to Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil is so highly sought after.

"Boom!"

Xu Yunfan's figure suddenly exploded into a hundred black rainbows, piercing through the cracks in the ice like falling meteors. Wherever he passed, the ten-thousand-year-old ancient ice actually parted on its own. The magma of the ninth layer of the Magma Prison automatically split apart beneath his feet, revealing the boiling magma sea below.

Xu Yunfan scanned the area. It was a purgatory intertwined with crimson and dark gold. Thick magma crawled slowly like the blood vessels of a giant beast, and丈许 (zhang-high) fire waves constantly exploded on its surface. As the fire waves crashed, they condensed into countless ferocious ghost faces, which let out silent roars before falling back into the sea of fire. Deeper down, dark purple Earthly Evil Qi writhed like giant pythons, tearing spiderweb-like cracks through the entire sea of fire.

"This place... I'm afraid it is close to the land of the Netherworld."

Xu Yunfan frowned deeply, his gaze penetrating the churning magma to look into the depths of the fire sea. In the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm, all living things have reincarnation, and there is naturally a High Heaven Netherworld. Beneath the boiling magma, faintly visible dark purple Evil Qi moved like giant pythons; every surge brought up countless twisted faces of resentful souls.

"The ninth layer of this Magma Prison, I'm afraid it has already touched the edge of the Netherworld."

He opened his Martial Dao Heavenly Eye; golden light flowed within it, clearly seeing the souls bound by the Earthly Evil Qi. He didn't know how these souls had descended here to suffer the torment of the purgatory.

Xu Yunfan stood at the edge of the magma sea. The True Warrior Subduing Devil True Sutra operated around him, and the True Warrior Heavenly Gang with dark black and gold textures surged through his meridians, echoing the boiling Earthly Evil Qi beneath his feet.

How to obtain the Subduing Demon Earthly Evil? With the help of the Attribute Panel, the True Warrior Subduing Devil True Sutra provided a very clear indication. It was to transcend the souls, achieve merit and virtue, and refine the extremely impure Earthly Evil below.

He took a deep breath and formed a seal with his hands. His ten fingers扣ed (clasped) the Heavenly Gang, and a strange brilliance flowed faintly between his knuckles. This was the True Warrior Subduing Devil Seal; it could both subdue and kill, and also transcend.

"True Warrior Subduing Devil, transcend and guide to rebirth!"

With a low shout, the True Warrior Subduing Devil True Sutra in Xu Yunfan's body suddenly erupted. A dark black pillar of light shot up from his Heavenly Spirit into the void, transforming into a Martial Dao Dharma Form. Refined from the Arctic Exorcising Demon Qi, a snake coiled around a tortoise. The Dharma Form opened its mouth and spat out a ray of clear light, like a river of stars falling, directly piercing into the sea of magma.

"Boom!"

The magma churned, and fire waves exploded. Under the illumination of the clear light, the souls bound by the Earthly Evil Qi gradually shed their ferocity, and their twisted faces regained peace.

For a whole day and night, Xu Yunfan still hadn't refined a single thread. He didn't grow discouraged; he simply continued to drive his vast true essence, performing the True Warrior Subduing Devil Seal, transforming into the snake coiled around the tortoise, using the Martial Dao Dharma Form refined from the Xuantian Treasure Scroll, the two intertwining, to ferry the souls.

Until half a month later.

A wisp of dark purple Evil Qi melted away like snow. Under the washing of the True Warrior Subduing Devil True Sutra, the impurities were completely removed, leaving only a thread of pure Subduing Demon Earthly Evil Qi, like a swimming snake shuttling through the magma.

Xu Yunfan's eyes focused, and the golden light in his Martial Dao Heavenly Eye surged, locking onto that wisp of Subduing Demon Earthly Evil.

(I returned late today and need to sort out the next plot. The next part will be the opening of a Foundation Building ceremony. I hope everyone will like it.)
