# Chapter 175: Foundation Establishment

Three months had passed since Li Shiming settled into the Wei Clan's stronghold. During this time, the Tie and Hu Clan cultivator families had employed numerous tactics, yet none had succeeded in breaching the Wei Clan's defensive formations. 

In their frustration, they ultimately set fire to the surrounding market district. Leaving behind several Qi Refinement cultivators, the two clans departed from the valley. However, through his split soul, Li Shiming observed them lying in ambush outside the valley, ready to storm in should any cultivators emerge from the Wei Clan's stronghold to attack their remaining Qi Refinement forces. 

Their carefully laid plans proved futile. Li Shiming paid them no mind, allowing the few Qi Refinement cultivators to remain in the valley. 

Each day, he cultivated using the upper-grade spiritual vein. With the assistance of his doppelganger, over these three months, he had elevated his spiritual energy to the peak of the ninth level of Qi Refinement. 

However, reaching the peak of the ninth level did not automatically qualify one for Foundation Establishment. His spiritual energy still required further refinement within his body. 

Had he been unconcerned about his future prospects in the Foundation Establishment stage, he could have attempted a breakthrough immediately. With seven Foundation Establishment Pills as insurance, success would have been almost guaranteed. 

But Li Shiming dared not take such a reckless approach. He needed to solidify his foundation thoroughly before attempting the breakthrough. 

Inside the cave abode's main hall, Li Shiming sat with his eyes closed, his consciousness linked to IBMZ15. 

Three months prior, upon settling here, he had assigned IBMZ15 a new research task: designing an array that would complement the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" to balance his five elemental spiritual energies. 

This was a method recorded in the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" that could increase the success rate of a breakthrough while simultaneously purifying spiritual energy during the conversion process. 

Back on Tianhai Island, multiple cultivators—including a Golden Core cultivator—had warned him that his physical constitution was excessively robust compared to his spiritual energy cultivation. This imbalance created a counterproductive effect, reducing his chances of a successful breakthrough. 

Being a Three Spiritual Roots cultivator already placed him at a disadvantage in terms of breakthrough probability. 

These factors had planted a seed of doubt in his mind, driving him to desperately seek more Foundation Establishment Pills. Through deliberate and coincidental means, he had acquired seven. 

Yet, this did little to alleviate his fear of failure. Unlike Heaven Spiritual Roots cultivators, who faced no obstacles in reaching Foundation Establishment—their challenges lay in advancing to Golden Core—Li Shiming had no such luxury. 

Thus, the vague records in the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" became a focal point of his attention. 

He even theorized that this method had been devised to grant Five Spiritual Roots cultivators a chance at Foundation Establishment. If it worked for them, surely his Three Spiritual Roots would benefit even more! 

Over three months, IBMZ15 continuously revised the array design, culminating in the current blueprint. 

This array, dubbed the "Five Elements Absorption Array," was tailored specifically for the "Five Elements Absorption Technique." It utilized the Wei Clan's defensive formations and the upper-grade spiritual vein to its fullest potential. 

Li Shiming retrieved the Ironwood Spirit Wood, Green Crystal, Flame Crystal, Earthbound Stone, and Petrified Iron—five second-grade elemental materials he had refined into array components. 

The hall's floor was now crisscrossed with intricate spiritual energy lines, converging from various points throughout the stronghold. 

To complete these lines, he had exhausted his stockpile of array materials and dismantled many of the Wei Clan's structures. Had any Wei Clan members survived, they would scarcely recognize their stronghold, now reduced to its bare framework. 

Only the main buildings remained intact, as they served as nodes for the defensive formation and could not be dismantled. All auxiliary formations had been repurposed into materials for the new array. 

The stronghold's grounds were now a labyrinth of crude spiritual energy lines connecting every node—an unactivated network that would seamlessly integrate into the "Five Elements Absorption Array" upon activation. 

This monumental task, completed over several days with the help of his doppelganger, now reached its critical phase. 

Carefully, Li Shiming placed the five second-grade elemental materials at their designated convergence points within the hall. 

"Activate!" he commanded softly. 

The entire Wei Clan stronghold trembled momentarily. 

The few Qi Refinement cultivators in the valley sensed the disturbance but, seeing no further activity at the stronghold's entrance, quickly dismissed it. 

These cultivators were no longer from the Tie or Hu Clans but were instead mercenaries hired to monitor the stronghold's comings and goings. 

Li Shiming extended his spiritual sense, observing the array's operation. 

Since the "Five Elements Absorption Array" had only been simulated by IBMZ15 and never tested in practice, its actual performance required verification. 

Lines of light flared across the stronghold as the array drew upon the formation's elemental energies, channeling them toward the main hall. 

The "Five Elements Absorption Array" activated, the five elemental materials emitting radiant glows—gold, green, blue, red, and yellow—representing their respective elemental attributes. 

Li Shiming sat at the array's core, the true focal point of its power. 

As he began circulating the "Five Elements Absorption Technique," the five-colored lights passed through his body and spiritual energy vortex. 

He felt his spiritual energy vortex synchronize with the array, becoming one with the stronghold's formation. 

Under the vortex's rotation, the formation's elemental energies converged upon the five elemental materials, linking them to his vortex through their respective nodes. 

Originally, his vortex contained only metal-attribute spiritual energy. Now, as the array operated, portions of the metal energy transformed into wood-attribute energy. 

The wood energy then converted partially into water, which in turn birthed fire, and fire yielded earth. 

Finally, earth cycled back to metal, completing the five-element cycle within his vortex for the first time. 

To his astonishment, each elemental conversion purified his spiritual energy further. 

Simultaneously, a miniature "Five Elements Absorption Array" began forming within his vortex. 

Unconcerned, Li Shiming assumed this internal array was merely a byproduct of the external array's influence and would dissipate once deactivated. 

The sensation of hosting an array within his body was novel. He adjusted its positioning to better harmonize with his energy flow. 

Time lost meaning as he immersed himself in the process. Hunger occasionally tugged at his awareness, prompting his doppelganger to provide nourishment before he refocused entirely. 

The internal and external arrays worked in tandem, steadily converting his spiritual energy. Though the process was slow, it was relentless. 

Seated atop the upper-grade spiritual vein's outlet, Li Shiming continuously absorbed ambient spiritual energy, which the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" converted into spiritual energy. 

For reasons unknown, the technique and array operated in perfect sync, never ceasing their function. 

Outside, the various factions had long abandoned their designs on the Wei Clan stronghold. This impregnable fortress, devoid of activity, had become irrelevant. They rebuilt their markets elsewhere, achieving their original objectives without further conflict. 

The Wei Clan no longer posed a threat. By all estimates, they retained at most a single early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator—hardly a competitive force. Even the sentries once posted outside had been withdrawn. 

Three more months passed. The once-bustling valley was now overgrown with weeds and shrubs, its entrance hidden from mortal eyes without need for concealment arrays. 

The former market district lay buried beneath towering grass, its charred ruins the only testament to its past. 

Within the stronghold's cave abode, Li Shiming reached the pivotal moment. His spiritual energy had been refined to its absolute limit. 

The five-pointed "Five Elements Absorption Array" within his vortex now operated autonomously, purifying all incoming energy into perfectly balanced elemental forces. 

His spiritual energy vortex brimmed at maximum capacity, every iota of space filled with exquisitely pure energy. 

Once more, he stood at the peak of the ninth level of Qi Refinement—this time with spiritual energy compressed to its utmost density. 

Consciousness returning, he contemplated attempting the breakthrough. 

The first step was deactivating the external "Five Elements Absorption Array." 

But when he sent out a tendril of spiritual sense to halt the array, he discovered, to his shock, that it had already vanished. 

The five elemental materials remained, but only as hollow shells—their pure elemental energies entirely depleted. 

"How?" If the external array was gone, why did the internal one persist? 

IBMZ15 offered no answers; this outcome exceeded its predictive models. 

Though the external array was defunct, the Wei Clan's formation continued channeling elemental energies directly into his internal array. 

The "Five Elements Absorption Technique" still functioned, absorbing all ambient spiritual energy indiscriminately and feeding it into the vortex's purification cycle. 

This process had spiraled beyond Li Shiming's control. The internal array now drove the technique's operation. 

His spiritual energy vortex strained at its limits, each influx threatening to rupture it. 

Just as despair crept in, the vortex exploded. 

Simultaneously, every node in the Wei Clan's formation dimmed. Had an attacker struck then, even an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator could have shattered the defenses with ease. 

Three months of continuous energy drainage had destabilized the formation beyond recovery. 

Li Shiming felt as though submerged in warm water, his very soul basking in the soothing sensation. 

A peculiar energy radiated from his former vortex site, suffusing his body and spirit, strengthening them profoundly. 

Where his vortex had been now lay a lake of spiritual energy, its center a radiant pool of liquid spiritual power. 

The five elemental points persisted, maintaining their cyclic operation. 

Emerging from his trance, Li Shiming assessed his transformation, his expression bemused. 

"That's it?" he murmured. 

He had stockpiled seven Foundation Establishment Pills, braced for an arduous trial. Never had he imagined achieving breakthrough without consuming a single pill. 

Yet here he stood—a Foundation Establishment cultivator. 

The liquid spiritual energy within him was proof, as was his soul's metamorphosis, now naturally capable of projecting spiritual sense. 

His preexisting spiritual sense, honed during Qi Refinement, had grown substantially more potent. 

Breaking through without Foundation Establishment Pills was a privilege reserved for Heaven Spiritual Roots cultivators—and even they typically kept one on hand as insurance.
