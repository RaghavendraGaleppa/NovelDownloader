# Chapter 132: No Way Out, Entering the Cave Heaven!

Yan Guan Mountain lay at the southernmost edge of the Central Plains, bordering the Southern Wastelands.  

This region was originally sparsely populated, with its earliest inhabitants frequently harassed by fierce beasts and birds from the Southern Wastelands. Occasionally, barbarian tribes from nearby would raid, pillage, and burn, while demons and ghosts also roamed the land.  

After the founding of the Great Zhou Dynasty, the imperial court assisted the locals in relocating northward. Over the next hundred years, the area became nearly deserted.  

However, following the death of the founding emperor, to guard against a counterattack from the Great Yan Kingdom in the Southern Wastelands, the Great Zhou Dynasty built a city here and stationed troops. Over the next few centuries, the region flourished.  

But this time, when the Heavenly Star descended, it enveloped Yan Guan Mountain, forming a Cave Heaven. Many cities, towns, and villages—along with hundreds of thousands of soldiers, civilians, and other living beings—were swallowed by the Cave Heaven, likely reduced to ashes.  

Now, in this southernmost region bordering the Southern Wastelands, only three cities and over a hundred scattered villages remained, with a total population of fewer than 100,000.  

Yet, after the Heavenly Star descended, the imperial court mobilized the Southern Army—200,000 elite troops—to surround the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven.  

"The Heavenly Star Cave Heaven at Yan Guan Mountain is the closest to the Central Plains. Now that the Great Zhou Dynasty has encircled it, many factions are dissatisfied," said the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official, reviewing the latest reports.  

"The Kunlun Immortal Sect, the Ascension Immortal Sect, the severely weakened Luofu Immortal Sect, the Diamond Temple, the Cloud-Sky Temple, and other sects like the Profound Sun Sword Sect and the Violet Dawn Dao Sect have all sent envoys to negotiate. They demand joint guardianship of the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven, just like with Twin Nine City."  

At this, the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official chuckled, as if mocking the situation.  

Guarding Twin Nine City was a last resort—a collective effort to defend the Central Plains against Fengdu Mountain. It was a duty that offered no direct benefits, so all factions wanted the Great Zhou border troops to bear the burden alone.  

However, the imperial court had stubbornly dragged the other factions into sharing the responsibility.  

Now, the tables had turned. The Great Zhou Dynasty sought to take sole charge of guarding the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven, but the other factions refused, insisting on joint guardianship under the pretense of protecting the Central Plains.  

"Guarding Twin Nine City was all cost and no gain," Li Zhengjing said with a smile. "But this Heavenly Star Cave Heaven—though its secrets remain unknown—fell from the heavens..."  

The Cave Heaven might be perilous, but Gao Xuan had escaped from it, his cultivation at the True Qi Realm rivaling that of a Human Immortal in the Upper Realm.  

This proved that the opportunities within the Cave Heaven were extraordinary, igniting the greed of all factions.  

"I heard even some powerful tribes from the Southern Wastelands want a piece of the pie, claiming this land borders their territory," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said. "But the Great Zhou Dynasty was enraged. Under the command of Marshal Yuan Jin and two other Human Immortals, they annihilated the nearest tribe to Yan Guan Mountain, slaughtering them all. The other Southern Wasteland tribes have since fallen silent, never mentioning the matter again."  

He then looked at Li Zhengjing and asked hesitantly, "So far, the only survivor from the Cave Heaven is Gao Xuan. Are you sure you want to investigate this place?"  

"Of the ten Heavenly Stars that fell, forming Cave Heavens across the land, only the one at Yan Guan Mountain has produced a survivor—Gao Xuan," Li Zhengjing replied. "Gao Xuan only escaped alive thanks to the mystical properties of this broken sword. Now that the sword is in my hands, I may be the only one who can enter the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven and return."  

The Hanging Bird squawked in alarm, "That won’t do! Gao Xuan escaped and went hunting down his own kin to devour them! Who knows if it was just the sword’s influence or if he was driven mad inside? What if you go in and come back wanting to eat us?"  

"Who said I was going to charge straight into the Cave Heaven?" Li Zhengjing rolled his eyes. "Investigating doesn’t mean throwing myself into danger."  

He had considered entering earlier, but the golden book’s fortune-telling indicated that while he wouldn’t face mortal peril, he would be tainted by "Annihilation Qi."  

Though he didn’t know what that meant, past readings had shown that such warnings usually led to life-threatening changes.  

In other words, while he wouldn’t die immediately, the Annihilation Qi would eventually steer his fate toward greater danger.  

Thus, Li Zhengjing chose to avoid the risk.  

His real purpose in coming to Yan Guan Mountain wasn’t to explore the Cave Heaven—it was to retrieve the Soul-Severing Whip!  

"The Soul-Severing Whip was retrieved from the Netherworld by us. It’s a Netherworld treasure left behind by the Great Zhou’s first Imperial Preceptor!"  

"The Ancient Moon Peak Master used it to slay the Creditor, but after being ambushed by the 'True Creditor,' the whip fell into their hands."  

"That True Creditor is almost certainly the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord."  

"Yet the golden book’s fortune indicates that coming here will lead me to the Soul-Severing Whip..."  

Li Zhengjing mused to himself, "The golden book suggests this item, originating from the Netherworld, will greatly aid my breakthrough to the Human Immortal Realm. I must reach that level as soon as possible to stand even a slim chance against the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord in three months—rather than being at his mercy."  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official looked toward Yan Guan Mountain and said quietly, "At most, three more days, and we’ll reach Yan Guan Mountain."  

Li Zhengjing understood his meaning and took out the Mask of Impermanence, putting it on.  

His reputation preceded him, and while his formidable strength deterred most from attacking, even a Sect Leader-level expert would hesitate to walk into an ambush or face a siege.  

Especially near Yan Guan Mountain’s Cave Heaven, where countless powerful figures—Human Immortals, deities, Arhats—had gathered.  

And the imperial court had stationed 200,000 troops there!  

If factions learned Li Zhengjing was heading to Yan Guan Mountain and set up a trap, even a Sect Leader might struggle to escape.  

"Let’s rest for now. I’ll disguise the horse, and you have the Five Elements Creation Tree modify the carriage’s appearance for concealment."  

"Agreed."  

Li Zhengjing then glanced at the distance, where the Five Elements Creation Tree’s branches tightly bound a young man named Hao Jian.  

The Hanging Bird curled its claws into tiny fists, relentlessly pummeling the youth.  

Though the blows looked light, they carried considerable force.  

The Wave-Severing Gu spread its wings, not using poison but ramming into the young man repeatedly. Each impact could shatter stone.  

Despite being at the peak of the True Qi Realm, the young man was still flesh and blood. He wailed in agony, tears and snot streaming down his face.  

Yuan Zhengfeng’s voice rang out, instructing the youth on how to circulate his Qi inward, relying solely on his physical body to endure.  

In this scene, Yuan Zhengfeng seemed like a benevolent mentor.  

But if the young man couldn’t bear the torment and released his Qi to block the attacks, Yuan Zhengfeng would scold him furiously and order the Hanging Bird and Wave-Severing Gu to strike harder!  

The youth was utterly miserable, a pitiful sight.  

"Isn’t this a bit excessive?" Li Zhengjing hesitated.  

"It’s for his own good," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said. "This is a technique I acquired from the Southern Wastelands—tempering the body, strengthening blood and Qi, while circulating internal energy to condense his essence. This will help his Three Souls and Seven Spirits realign faster, restoring his mind!"  

He added, "Moreover, this training will aid his future breakthrough to the Human Immortal Realm."  

Li Zhengjing, ever kind-hearted, couldn’t bear to watch. "But he’s being beaten too brutally."  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official continued, "At this rate, he’ll recover in less than three days, no longer muddle-headed."  

Li Zhengjing glanced at the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron in his hand and sighed. "Then tell the Hanging Bird and Wave-Severing Gu to hit him even harder."  

After all, this suffering was paving the way for the young man’s future ascension to Human Immortal.  

The thought moved Li Zhengjing—until he saw the little dragon girl gleefully raising her tiny fists to punch the youth.  

"Stop!" Li Zhengjing roared.  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official’s pupils contracted. "Don’t let her hit him!"  

The dragon girl’s punches were no joke!  

When the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official had taken one, he’d ended up on a stretcher.  

A mere True Qi Realm cultivator like this youth wouldn’t survive a single blow—or if his body held, his soul might scatter!  

Li Zhengjing hurried over, dragging the dragon girl away. "This isn’t a game for you! A little girl shouldn’t go around punching people! Is this how I raised you?"  

"..."  

The dragon girl tilted her head. Didn’t he always get into fights and then call her to help when he couldn’t win?  

So wasn’t punching people exactly what he’d taught her?  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing was speechless. Then he sensed something amiss. With a start, he flipped open the phoenix wood box and retrieved an ancient mirror inside.  

This wasn’t the Mirror of Profound Sight—it was the bronze mirror given by the former Ancient Moon Peak Master!  

The mirror flickered, displaying a single message:  

"The True Creditor is at Yan Guan Mountain!"  

"My injuries are not yet healed, and my preparations are incomplete. I cannot act recklessly!"  

"I have already sent people to Yan Guan Mountain to investigate all disciples of the Ascension Immortal Sect present. The True Creditor may be among them!"  

"I’ve received word that your cultivation progress is too rapid. You must slow down—do not mature too quickly, lest the True Creditor harvest you prematurely!"  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing frowned at the message.  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official leaned in, and Yuan Zhengfeng, curious, was lifted into Li Zhengjing’s palm.  

"The True Creditor is at Yan Guan Mountain?"  

"Are we still going?"  

"We are."  

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden book’s fortune. No wonder it indicated he would obtain the Soul-Severing Whip at Yan Guan Mountain—the True Creditor who possessed it was there.  

Yet the fortune showed no mortal peril.  

Likely, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord’s plans weren’t ready—he wouldn’t harvest Li Zhengjing three months early.  

Under normal circumstances, Li Zhengjing would avoid the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord at all costs. But the golden book’s prediction made it clear: in three months, the harvest would come.  

Now, he had to gather every opportunity the golden book revealed, bolstering his chances of survival.  

There was no hiding from the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord’s gaze!  

"But how did the Ancient Moon Peak Master know we were heading to Yan Guan Mountain?" the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official wondered.  

"That man is cunning. Though nearing the end of his lifespan and making his final gamble, he’s clearly kept abreast of the outside world," Yuan Zhengfeng mused. "Perhaps he heard about Zhengjing obtaining the Yan Guan Mountain Cave Heaven’s opportunity and learned we left Hongshan Town, deducing our destination. Thus, he sent a warning to prevent us from running into the Creditor."  

"One more thing," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said thoughtfully. "Now a fugitive, how did he learn the True Creditor’s whereabouts?"  

"What are you implying?" Li Zhengjing sensed deeper meaning in his words.  

"The Third Generation Ten Thousand Calamities World-Saving Heavenly Sovereign fled from the seas near Hongshan Town in terror..."  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official’s tone was grave. "The only one who could inspire such fear in him is likely the True Creditor."  

He looked at Li Zhengjing. "The True Creditor’s identity remains unknown, as do his movements and full power. Yet someone knows his location—I suspect the source is someone the Creditor is hunting."  

Li Zhengjing understood. "You mean the Third Generation Heavenly Sovereign leaked the Creditor’s whereabouts!"  

Yuan Zhengfeng added, "The world is calm, and none of the major sects seem aware. If the Heavenly Sovereign did spread this, it must have been within the World-Saving Golden Ship. Meaning the former Ancient Moon Peak Master is hiding aboard the ship."  

"Let me verify."  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official took out the boarding token he’d previously given Li Zhengjing.  

About two hours later, he spread his wings and flew ahead.  

A black-robed middle-aged man approached from the mountains ahead, his expression complex as he regarded the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official.  

"You’ve defected again, Elder. Do you wish to return to the World-Saving Golden Ship?"  

"You arrived too quickly," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said, frowning.  

"I was already near Yan Guan Mountain," the man replied, his eyes dim. "In the past, the Heavenly Sovereign valued your unparalleled medical skills and spared you out of admiration. But henceforth, if you defect again, no one will shield you."  

"The Heavenly Sovereign has fallen?" the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official asked.  

"He entered the Yan Guan Mountain Cave Heaven," the man said heavily. "Two days ago, he sent his final message to the ship."  

A glow flickered as the man handed over the message.  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official read it, his expression darkening.  

*"Pursued by the True Creditor, with no escape in heaven or earth, I shall enter the Yan Guan Mountain Heavenly Star Cave Heaven!"*  

*"Today, I leave the Heavenly Sovereign’s token and complete legacy outside the Cave Heaven. Only the Golden Ship’s secret arts can decipher it!"*  

*"Whoever obtains these shall be the Fourth Generation Ten Thousand Calamities World-Saving Heavenly Sovereign!"*
