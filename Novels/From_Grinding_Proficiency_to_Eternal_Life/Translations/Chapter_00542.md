# Chapter 542: Huh? Can't Suck It Out

Xu Yunfan’s thoughts stirred slightly, and an invisible wave of spiritual power instantly enveloped the immobilized Liu Yunhua and the terrified Pu Yu.

Feeling this heavy spiritual power, as oppressive as a mountain peak, both Liu Yunhua and Pu Yu were horrified in their hearts.

This was the spiritual power that should belong to a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Even a true scripture specialized in accumulating spiritual power would likely fall short of Xu Yunfan’s vast, ocean-like reserves.

This was naturally the effect of the perfect advancement brought by each level-up of his Attribute Panel.

The three figures blurred and vanished from the spot, as if swallowed by an invisible giant mouth, leaving behind only a few faint wisps of thunder qi in the courtyard. These dissipated instantly, unnoticed by anyone.

The next moment, the three were inside Xu Yunfan’s personal cave dwelling deep within the Divine Thunder Peak.

The cave dwelling was not luxurious; rather, it exuded a cold, hard rigidity and the unique sharpness of thunder.

The walls, carved from rock, were inscribed with profound thunder patterns that faintly drew in the thin threads of thunder elemental qi scattered in the surrounding space.

The ground was smooth as a mirror, and in the center stood a simple stone platform for cultivation.

The air was filled with the unique fishy scent of thunderstruck stone, as well as the pure and domineering thunder law intent that had settled over years of cultivating the *Nine Heavens Sovereign Thunder Scripture*.

Xu Yunfan had carved over a dozen interlocking arrays here to draw and gather thunder, causing the Divine Thunder Peak to be perpetually shrouded in dark clouds, with thunder and lightning flashing day and night.

Aside from Xu Yunfan’s own cultivation, this also benefited the other disciples of the Divine Thunder Peak.

Cultivating the Divine Thunder Scripture in such an environment naturally yielded twice the result with half the effort.

Inside the cave dwelling, stripped of the direct physical suppression of the proto-heavenly realm, Liu Yunhua felt as if every bone in her body had been crushed. Intense pain, accompanied by the weakness of her spiritual power being completely locked, swept over her.

She struggled to sit up, but found her limbs and bones incredibly heavy. Her meridians were empty, her spiritual power like stagnant water; she couldn't even perform the most basic manipulation.

The press from Xu Yunfan contained the absolute restraint and suppression of the proto-heavenly realm. The force had penetrated her marrow and sealed her acupoints, making autonomous recovery impossible in the short term.

Moreover, if she attempted to operate the spiritual power suppressed back into her dantian to break the shackles, Xu Yunfan would surely detect it immediately.

A wave of despair washed over Liu Yunhua.

On the surface, the Primordial Origin Sect indeed forbids mutual harm among fellow disciples.

But privately, as long as it isn't discovered, death is just death. Unless one's own faction seeks justice, no one will care.

Furthermore, so many people are waiting to take their place.

The Dao Fruit sought by the Hundred Desires Peak is coveted by many.

Over the years, the passing down of the law lineage has been just enough to support a few true Foundation Establishment cultivators. But now, if one is missing, the difficulty of condensing a Dao Base will be slightly less.

Pu Yu was in slightly better condition, but she was also slumped on the ground, trembling. Her gaze towards Xu Yunfan was like looking at a demon descended upon the world.

And not just any demon, but a hungry ghost from the lust realm. From the moment they met, his words were explicit, without a shred of shame.

Being captured by such a person, one could already imagine the outcome.

Xu Yunfan stood at the entrance of the cave dwelling, his back to the two women. The faint vibration lingering on his fingertips slowly subsided.

He swept his gaze over the simple furnishings inside the cave dwelling, ensuring no detection spells remained, and let out a slight sigh of relief.

Although he had yet to comprehend the advancement of the Array Dao, with the assistance of his Attribute Panel, the basic understanding of Array Dao allowed him to perform miracles.

Once he reached a certain level of understanding, even Zhang Ziyang inside the Soul-Devouring Banner was greatly surprised.

明明前一刻还参悟不得要领，下一秒就一副恍然大悟，甚至举一反三，而且一副熟稔得参悟多年的模样，弄得他是一愣一愣的。
(Just moments ago, he couldn't grasp the key points, but the next second, he looked as if he had a sudden enlightenment, even able to extrapolate from one instance to another, and looked as proficient as if he had been studying it for years, leaving the other party dumbfounded.)

Outside, the sun was blazing, but deep inside the cave dwelling, only the cold light emitted by the thunder restrictions illuminated his deep, calm profile.

He slowly turned around. The chill on his face hadn't disappeared; instead, it became even more solemn. His eyes swept over the two women with undisguised aggression.

Looking at Liu Yunhua, who was sitting on the ground, her dignity lost and in a wretched state, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate in the slightest.

Xu Yunfan swore that he truly wasn't lusting after beauty. Rather, Liu Yunhua was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, and she had immersed herself in the Dao of Dual Cultivation for many years. She was absolutely an excellent, top-quality cauldron.

He had to seize the moment while she was completely restrained and at her weakest to obtain what he needed.

It might even provide an opportunity for his *Nine Heavens Sovereign Thunder Scripture* to advance further.

Cultivators of the Hundred Desires Peak, especially experts like Liu Yunhua who meticulously studied the Dao of Seduction and Extraction, must have their ability to resist and hidden dangers eliminated immediately, and then be dealt with swiftly.

His will moved, and his Divine Sense instantly probed out, invading Liu Yunhua’s spiritual sea.

At the same time, he directly got to the point. Before Liu Yunhua could react, he initiated direct negative contact.

Then, the incantation for the *Hundred Desires Devouring Yuan Great Method* operated in his spiritual sea. A unique suction force emanated from him, directly drawing upon her dantian and the life essence and pure yuan qi hidden deep within her acupoints, attempting to absorb them into his body.

Xu Yunfan’s plan was simple. Since the other party had come to cause trouble, it was perfectly fine to use their own methods against them.

Liu Yunhua wanted to use him as a cauldron; now, he would turn this Hundred Desires Peak Master into his own medicinal cauldron residue.

He would plunder the essence and energy she had cultivated for many years, filled with profound Dao intent, to nourish his own proto-heavenly realm and cultivation.

This was purer than any spirit pill or divine medicine.

To be honest, as long as the Hundred Desires Peak disciples were willing to offer themselves willingly, allowing him to extract during dual cultivation, the essence and spiritual power cultivated by the other party for decades or even a century would be the best tonic in the world, with no side effects.

One must know that all medicine has some toxicity, but the true dual cultivation method practiced by the Hundred Desires Peak emphasizes the principle of Yin and Yang, naturally achieving what others cannot.

An invisible devouring force field, like a spider web, enveloped Liu Yunhua.

Xu Yunfan’s expression was indifferent, waiting for the expected torrent of yuan qi to rush over.

However, a sudden change occurred.

That suction, sufficient to instantly drain the essence of an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator and turn them into a废废, when it landed on Liu Yunhua, was like a stone sinking into the sea.

The spiritual power barriers within Liu Yunhua’s body remained unmoved. The essence hidden in her life essence and deep within her acupoints seemed to be protected by an indestructible, unique "membrane."

The devouring force of the *Hundred Desires Devouring Yuan Great Method* crashed against it, emitting a silent, dull rumble, but failed to stir even a single ripple.

The anticipated majestic essence did not appear. What was fed back was a stubborn, extreme "hardness," as if trying to suck the core energy out of a ten-thousand-year-old bedrock. There was simply no way to start.

"Huh?"

For the first time, genuine surprise appeared in Xu Yunfan’s eyes.

He frowned slightly and increased the devouring intensity.

Although the *Hundred Desires Devouring Yuan Great Method* was a true scripture often practiced by Hundred Desires Peak disciples, under the Attribute Panel's support, it had now reached Great Perfection. Its effect of plundering essence had always been domineering and unparalleled, never failing on an opponent who had lost the ability to resist.

Especially since the other party was also an expert in this field, practicing a method from the same source.
