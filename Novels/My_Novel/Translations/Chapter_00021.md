Chapter 21: Beating Bi Hao and Venting One's Anger

Because the guard duty at the servants' quarters required several hours, Li Xian and Zhao Dachun first went to the dining pavilion to have a hearty meal before heading to the servants' quarters.

Before the work began, they had to hand over the duties to the servants' steward, Luo Fang.

"Steward Luo, long time no see."

Upon seeing Luo Fang again, Li Xian smiled meaningfully. His situation and status had completely changed.

He wouldn't say he was fully vindicated, but he had at least vented a bit of his suppressed anger.

Luo Fang forced a smile, looking as if he wanted to say something but held back. Now that Li Xian was an official guard, there was nothing he could do to him.

"Thanks to Steward Luo's promotion, otherwise, this guard position would have nothing to do with me," Li Xian said calmly.

"Haha, yes," Luo Fang said, his fist clenching tightly in his palm, a vicious thought rising in his heart. "A lowly beast, upon gaining a bit of power, dares to come back and show off in front of me."

Zhao Dachun said, "Steward Luo, organizing the servants is your duty. We are only responsible for the guard duty. Please hurry up, otherwise, the work won't be finished."

After a simple handover, Luo Fang struck the bronze gong to summon the various teams of servants. Qingning County lacked everything, but it never lacked people.

During this period, Luo Fang had recruited nearly a hundred more servants, keeping the total number around thirteen hundred.

Li Xian's gaze fell on the ninth team of servants. But he only glanced at them lightly before looking away.

The servants in the ninth team didn't recognize Li Xian. They looked up at him with gazes of admiration, envy, and uncertainty. They whispered among themselves, saying they had never seen such a handsome and divine-looking guard master.

With a command from Luo Fang, the servants began to move lumber and stone. Some of the finer stones were pulled in wooden carts, but the lumber was much harder to transport.

Even the smaller pieces of lumber were over ten feet tall, requiring seven or eight people to carry them together, step by step, back to the manor.

A three-mile road was truly arduous.

Watching the servants sweating profusely and gritting their teeth as they worked, Li Xian didn't feel the light and pleasant joy of having escaped from such hardship.

On the other side, Luo Fang found Bi Hao. "Good nephew, how are your injuries?"

Last time, Bi Hao had lost his fight, which displeased Luo Fang. Since then, Luo Fang's attitude toward Bi Hao had changed drastically, and he would often slap him.

Bi Hao began to fear his uncle, his gaze evasive. Seeing Luo Fang approach now, he took three steps back, covering his face with his hands. "U-Uncle, what is it?"

"Do you want revenge?" Luo Fang asked, squinting.

"Revenge? Who..." Bi Hao's eyes suddenly lit up with hatred. "Is it that ungrateful wretch, Li Xian!?"

Luo Fang nodded. "Exactly, it's that bastard."

"You said last time that Li Xian's martial arts skill was far inferior to yours. Is that true?" Luo Fang asked seriously.

"Of course, it's true!" Bi Hao slammed his thigh hard, biting his lips until they bled. "That thief! If we were to fight again, I would definitely get my revenge!"

"Good, the opportunity is here."

Luo Fang pointed into the distance and sneered. "That person is Li Xian. That小子 has been a guard for a few days and has started to look the part. Later, you'll go challenge him to a fight. Defeat him and make him lose all face. Afterward, I'll find a way to make my move. Hehe."

Bi Hao rejoiced. "Then I can become a guard? That's great! I've dreamed of becoming a guard."

Luo Fang spat. "Wishful thinking. That小子 has his footing now. Unless he makes a mistake himself, he won't be coming down."

Bi Hao was very disappointed. He looked toward Li Xian and couldn't help but be taken aback. "Uncle, is that really Li Xian?" Luo Fang nodded. "Absolutely."

Bi Hao looked at Li Xian, who was dressed neatly, had a handsome face, and was beginning to show some grace. He was much taller and sturdier than before.

Thinking of himself, although he had his uncle's protection, he was still a servant in the end. And his uncle's attitude had changed, often beating and scolding him, so things weren't good either. Instantly, his resentment was hard to suppress. "If it weren't for you, all of this would have been mine!"

"Good nephew, this time it's up to you," Luo Fang said, patting Bi Hao's shoulder. "Also, remember... this time, don't be careless. That小子 has mastered the Four Directions Fist, otherwise, he wouldn't have passed the assessment."

"I'm going to find that Luo Tongyun and demand my ten taels of silver back! What was he even doing?"

"My Three Talents Fist is no slouch either!" Bi Hao's voice was hoarse.

The uncle and nephew finalized their plan. Luo Fang, seeing the right moment, struck the gong and told the servants to take a break.

During the break, the two of them sang a duet, their words dripping with sarcasm and provocation aimed at Li Xian. They wanted him to fight Bi Hao again.

"Oh?" Li Xian looked at Bi Hao. "Brother Bi, are you still unconvinced by our last match?"

"Lord Li..." Bi Hao lowered his head. "It's not that I'm unconvinced. It's just that as the saying goes, martial arts must be honed in actual combat. I've had some small breakthroughs recently and wanted to ask Lord Li for some guidance. Of course, if Lord Li fears a mere servant, then it's fine to refuse."

Li Xian said, "Sparring is a good thing, but fists and feet have no eyes. When we fight, it's inevitable..."

"It's fine. I, Bi Hao, have a cheap life anyway. Lord Li, you don't need to hold back." Bi Hao immediately pressed his advantage, leaving no room for retreat.

"Alright, alright," Li Xian said, shaking his head.

Seeing his plan succeed, Luo Fang called for the servants to form a circle to watch the fight.

"You beasts, such a blessing for your eyes doesn't come every day."

"Watch carefully."

"If you can learn a thing or two, and with a bit of luck, you might just be the next Guard Li!"

"Please show mercy," Bi Hao said, clenching his fists and taking his stance, gathering all his energy.

After a moment of building up momentum, he suddenly stepped forward and threw three feints to test the waters. Li Xian saw through them all and stood motionless.

"Good小子, you're putting on quite a show," Bi Hao said. Seeing he couldn't fool Li Xian, he immediately hid a real attack within a feint, throwing a "Ground Stance Fist" at Li Xian's chest.

Li Xian used the "Raging Bull Charge" move from the Raging Bull Fist. Inner strength wrapped around his fist, and as it shot out, it carried the sound of a raging bull. The two fists collided.

This time, it was Bi Hao whose bones cracked.

The force of the Raging Bull Fist seemed gentle on the surface, but it hid a storm within. In a simple exchange of fists, even the Four Directions Fist would struggle to win.

Li Xian sneered. "You asked for this!"

As the momentum of the Raging Bull Fist ended, he immediately followed up with the Four Directions Fist, aiming straight for Bi Hao's face. Bi Hao hurriedly raised his hands to defend, but saw the fist's path change, striking him on the shoulder instead.

Li Xian threw nine consecutive punches. Each fist was unpredictable, taking the principles of fist-fighting to the extreme. With a series of "bang, bang, bang" sounds, Bi Hao was already defeated.

This fight would put him in bed for at least a month.

Li Xian's eyes narrowed. "If these two get the chance, they will surely try to take my life. I don't need to be polite." His final punch aimed for Bi Hao's throat.

"Uncle..." Bi Hao was terrified, feeling as if he was about to die.

"You dare!"

Luo Fang roared in anger and leaped forward, reaching out to protect Bi Hao. Knowing he couldn't take Bi Hao's life now, Li Xian's body trembled, causing his fist to veer off.

It landed squarely on Luo Fang's face.

This punch carried a full seventy percent of his inner strength, leaving Luo Fang's cheek red and swollen, and loosening several of his teeth.

It was a heavy blow!

Li Xian frowned, retracting his fist. His arm was somewhat sore and numb, and for a moment, he couldn't lift any strength. The instant his fist had struck Luo Fang's face, a rebounding force had traveled back to him.

"This Luo Fang's martial arts are not bad. I am no match for him for now," Li Xian thought, then smiled. "Brother Bi, did you gain any insight from my earlier guidance?"

Bi Hao was both shocked and furious. Guidance? He had almost lost his life, and he calls that guidance? Luo Fang spoke first. "Thank you, Guard Li, for your guidance. My foolish nephew has probably gained a great deal."

His voice was rather gloomy.

"That's good to hear, that's very good," Li Xian said with a laugh.

This time was not a loss. He had beaten Bi Hao thoroughly and had also slapped Luo Fang across the face.
