# Chapter 45: Winter Hunt Approaches, An Old Friend Reappears

Li Xian condensed his Qi into threads, starting from his Dantian, and once again attempted to circulate Qi through the Small Heavenly Cycle.

He traversed the major acupoints along the cycle. By the time he reached the one hundred and twelfth major acupoint, the Qi within his Dantian was completely exhausted. The Qi could no longer maintain its form and dissipated into his flesh and blood.

"Although I am still far from fully circulating Qi through the cycle..."

"Compared to last time, the progress is already quite obvious!"

Jiang Yun, a B-rank guard, was originally a famine refugee from Purple Amber County.

Fortunately, she had some distant relations with Autumn Moon, Madam Wen's personal maid. Through Autumn Moon's recommendation, she was able to enter the manor to serve as a guard.

In this vast manor, beneath the Madam, Autumn Moon held the highest authority.

"Speak, what matter brings you to me?"

In a stone pavilion with beautiful scenery.

Jiang Yun bowed, her face filled with a docile and obedient expression. She bent over and offered tea with both hands. Autumn Moon slowly took it, glanced at Jiang Yun, and asked casually, "What is it?"

"Sister Autumn Moon, I failed the guard assessment again. I just can't seem to reach A-rank..." Jiang Yun said, appearing very awkward.

"Oh?"

Autumn Moon shook her head. "It's not your fault. You are a woman, after all, and your martial talent is only average. If I hadn't remembered our connection and supported you, you would have struggled to even make B-rank, let alone A-rank."

"Yes, yes, thank you for your great kindness, Sister Autumn Moon," Jiang Yun hurriedly thanked her.

"Besides..."

"You are a woman. On the martial stage, you are naturally at a disadvantage."

Autumn Moon took a sip of tea and frowned. "What kind of tea is this?"

"It's Mingxiang tea. I specifically..."

Jiang Yun didn't get to finish. A slap landed across her face. Autumn Moon cursed, "This kind of inferior tea simply dirties my mouth!"

Angrily, she threw the teacup, shattering it to pieces on the ground, tea splashing everywhere. She then said impatiently, "If you have something to ask, just say it quickly."

"Yes, yes."

Jiang Yun didn't dare to get angry and said with a forced smile, "It's like this, that kid named Li Xian has been quite active lately. I had some trouble with him a while ago. Do you think I should..."

"Him..." Autumn Moon naturally had an impression; she was present during the food distribution incident.

Autumn Moon waved her hand dismissively. "No need to bother with him. He's just a nobody."

Hearing this, a heavy stone lifted from Jiang Yun's heart. "There is also the matter of the Winter Hunt..."

"Now that you mention the Winter Hunt, I just remembered."

Autumn Moon gestured for Jiang Yun to come closer and lowered her voice. "This Winter Hunt might allow you to find a different path and enter A-rank."

"The Madam has been in a good mood lately, and the Winter Hunt is her favorite activity. Make sure you perform well."

Jiang Yun's eyes lit up. She pulled a piece of gold and jade from her chest and offered it with both hands. "Thank you for the reminder, Sister Autumn Moon. This is a gift for you."

Autumn Moon raised an eyebrow. The gold and jade had a fine texture, carved with flower and bird patterns, quite exquisite.

Gold was hard currency. Even though the dynasty was in turmoil and the situation was changing, this stuff would always be valuable. No one ever had too much of it, so she naturally accepted it.

Seeing that Jiang Yun must have gone to great lengths to obtain this item, Autumn Moon softened her voice considerably. "You're somewhat sensible. Don't tell anyone I was here." She got up and left.

Several days had passed since the food distribution. Life went on as usual, calm without a single ripple.

Whenever the other guards met Li Xian, they felt envy, fear, or dissatisfaction, but no one dared to provoke him easily.

Li Xian didn't have many friends, nor did he actively try to make any. However, he was warm and kind to others, which earned him some goodwill.

"It's almost the end of October. I wonder how my younger brother's imperial exam is going?"

Li Xian's thoughts drifted as he leaned against a tree trunk, holding his long knife.

"Brother Li, after we finish patrolling, shall we go up the mountain?"

At that moment, a figure ran over.

The man was named Le Zhitao, also a C-rank guard. Ever since the meat distribution incident, he had actively tried to befriend Li Xian.

Both were C-rank guards with plenty of free time. Sometimes, after patrolling, Le Zhitao would find Li Xian to eat together at the canteen.

Although they were close, their friendship wasn't deep.

Li Xian had a cold nature beneath a warm exterior. He would respond to anyone who spoke to him and wouldn't refuse to accompany them. However, truly becoming friends wasn't that easy.

"Up the mountain? Why go up the mountain?" Li Xian asked.

Le Zhitao said, "You didn't know? The Winter Hunt is coming!"

"I've heard of the Winter Hunt, but what does it have to do with going up the mountain?" Li Xian shook his head and stood up slowly, brushing the snow off his body.

"You need to prepare your own bow for the Winter Hunt. Didn't you know? If you don't go up the mountain to chop wood and make a bow, you won't be able to participate in the Winter Hunt!" Le Zhitao explained.

Li Xian frowned. "Chop wood to make a bow? A bow and arrow have complex craftsmanship; it takes at least a few weeks. Isn't it a bit too late to make a bow now?"

"There's a rare type of wood on the next mountain over. The branches are tough and elastic. Just tie some cow tendons on it, and voila, you have a bow," Le Zhitao said as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Li Xian thought to himself, "That's more like a toy." A bow and arrow's feel was extremely important. The bow arms and stringing were secondary; the most important thing was the synergy between the person and the bow.

The archer must know the bow, and the bow must know the archer, for there to be a hundred shots, a hundred hits. Li Xian was born in a hunter's family and was most proficient in this way. He had been making his own bows since he was five.

By the age of eleven, his archery skills had surpassed his father's.

Since ancient times, archers have held a very respected status. This was true both in the military and in the Jianghu.

Hearing that the Winter Hunt was approaching, Li Xian couldn't help but think: "Instead of making a new bow, I might as well... take out my old friend again."

He immediately said to Le Zhitao, "You guys go ahead. I won't be going."

"Ah!" Le Zhitao shook his head. "What a pity, what a pity."

After Le Zhitao's reminder, Li Xian finished his patrol, asked Pang Long for half a day off, and set off for Green County.

It was the end of October. The weather was freezing, the land was covered in silver, and cold wild geese flew overhead from time to time.

"Ordinary wild geese migrate south in winter and return in spring. Only these cold wild geese don't follow the usual path. They head straight for wherever it is coldest."

It had been a long time since he left the manor. Walking on the road, Li Xian felt his mind become clear and peaceful.

After walking seven or eight miles, he suddenly heard waves of wailing from the distance:

"Grandpa, Grandpa, spare me! I won't do it again, I won't do it again!"

"Ouch, stop hitting me, stop hitting me."

Turning his head to look, he saw five guards surrounding a man and beating him.

From the looks of the scene, the man must have been caught cutting trees by the guards.

"Him?"

Li Xian glanced again and found that the man being beaten was actually Wang Yonghou, the husband of Aunt Liu.

He immediately hurried over and said, "Stop."

"Your grandma's! Keep hitting him!"

These men were guards of the Lin family from Green County. They glanced at Li Xian, completely disregarding him, and continued to kick and beat Wang Yonghou.

Li Xian frowned. He leaped forward and kicked one of the guards in the buttocks, sending him tumbling head over heels in a pathetic state.

The other guards were stunned. One of them cursed, "You damn bastard, you brought help? Brothers, deal with him first!"

Four or five men rushed forward. Li Xian snorted coldly and charged straight at the guard who had spoken, throwing two punches straight at his face.

Then, leaping into the air, he swept his legs, kicking each of the surrounding guards.

In a flash, he had dealt with all of them.

"You... who are you?! How dare you hit us! Just you wait, just you wait!"

The guard howled, pointing at Li Xian, both afraid and angry.

"Wait?" Li Xian roared, "If I'm not mistaken, this is the forest of the One Union Manor. When did it become any of the Lin family's business to interfere?"

"This... this..."

The guards were instantly silenced.

They actually didn't know whose forest this was. They just saw someone cutting trees, knew they could have some fun, and beat him for amusement.

"Does your Lin family have the nerve to offend the One Union Manor? Think about that carefully."

"If you have nothing else to say, shut your mouths and get lost."

On the final words "get lost," Li Xian infused his Internal Qi into his shout, the sound shaking their hearts.

It immediately scared the bullying, cowardly guards into fleeing in a pathetic mess.
