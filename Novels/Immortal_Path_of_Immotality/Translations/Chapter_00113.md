# Chapter 113: Joining the Black Lotus Sect

A group of a hundred people traveled on Yan Yuanchun's brocade handkerchief for five full days and nights before reaching the depths of the East Sea. Only by crossing it once could one truly understand how vast the East Sea was.

Day and night, there was only the eternal blue sea for company, with occasional islands scattered like stars. The emptiness and loneliness were overwhelming. No wonder there were no top-tier sects in the East Sea—despite its vastness, the islands were scattered and disconnected. Without a sea chart, one could wander blindly for half a month without finding a single island.

During the journey, Luan Chun, the lively and carefree girl, initially ignored Lin Shan out of anger but couldn't resist coming back the next day to bicker with him. Through their banter, Lin Shan gradually gleaned some information about the current situation of the three overseas demonic sects and the background of Yan Yuanchun, a Golden Core protector.

A thousand years ago, the three major orthodox sects of the Great Song Dynasty were at their peak. With their power expanding, they needed more territory. However, the Great Song's resources were already divided among the six major orthodox and demonic sects. To grow further, they had to seize more land. Coincidentally, tensions between the orthodox and demonic factions were already high. The orthodox sect leaders assessed their strength and realized that the demonic sects were in a weak phase—older experts were fading away, and the younger generation hadn't yet matured.

Seizing this opportunity, the orthodox sects found an excuse to launch a full-scale war in the Great Song's cultivation world. After years of fierce battles, the three demonic sects—the Hundred Ghosts Sect, the Blood River Hall, and the Black Lotus Sect—were defeated, their mountain strongholds breached, forcing them to flee north to the Great Yan Kingdom.

However, the Yan Kingdom's cultivation resources were already monopolized by local factions, leaving no place for the refugees. Thus, they continued their journey north, crossing over a dozen countries before finally finding a foothold in the distant Lu Kingdom. There, they were reportedly taken in by a super demonic sect that dominated over a dozen countries, providing sanctuary for the three exiled demonic sects from the Great Song.

Meanwhile, some remnants of the demonic factions in the Great Song chose to go underground instead of fleeing. In Luan Chun's words, they were the "Sacred Sect's survivors"—essentially, they had been living as outcasts in the Great Song for a millennium, hiding in the shadows and occasionally being hunted down by orthodox sects.

For example, the Black Lotus Envoy Lin Shan encountered in the Yelang Ancient Tomb in the Southern Border was tragically tracked down by Thunderbolt Child, captured, and brought back to the Violet Mist Sect for judgment. Yan Yuanchun, a Golden Core cultivator of the Black Lotus Sect, had been hiding in a brothel in Yichuan Market, secretly grooming loyalists and occasionally receiving directives from the distant northern headquarters.

A thousand years passed in the blink of an eye. The three demonic sects in the Lu Kingdom, having somehow regained their former strength, now sought to return to their homeland in the Great Song to reclaim their ancestral legacy and seek revenge on the orthodox sects.

Two years ago, through a series of diplomatic maneuvers and alliances, they joined forces with the Southern Sea's major sect, the Rain Pavilion, and the Yan Kingdom's demonic sect, the Yellow Springs Sect, to seize control of the entire East Sea. Now, waves of reinforcements were arriving from the Lu Kingdom. Combined with the recruited rogue cultivators from the East Sea and the remnants who had hidden in the Great Song for centuries, the demonic factions were preparing to launch an assault on the mainland in the coming years.

Yan Yuanchun's journey to the East Sea with over a hundred disciples was essentially an early return to the Black Lotus Sect's fold before the war began. Once the fighting started, escaping the mainland would be far more difficult.

As they talked, the silhouette of an island gradually appeared on the horizon. As the brocade handkerchief approached, they saw a massive archipelago spanning nearly a thousand miles. The islands were dotted with towering volcanoes spewing heat, while some peaks, thousands of meters high, were capped with snow, creating a stark contrast with the lower regions.

Several mortal cities thrived on the islands, and the three highest peaks had been transformed with palaces and temples. Clearly, this remote location in the East Sea, with its vast territory and excellent spiritual veins, had become the temporary headquarters of the three demonic sects.

Yan Yuanchun led the group to land on the leftmost peak, where a bustling crowd of over ten thousand cultivators hurried about, all seemingly on urgent missions. Most Black Lotus Sect members wore black robes and hoods, exuding a strong religious aura.

"This is the Black Lotus Sect's temporary headquarters," Yan Yuanchun explained. "I'll take you to the main altar to meet the Sect Master and confirm our branch's return."

The group followed her up the mountain, passing newly built palaces and caves, many of which appeared uninhabited. Given that the East Sea had only recently been secured, most cultivators were likely dispatched to stabilize the region, leaving only the newly arrived reinforcements at the headquarters.

After climbing thousands of steps and traversing numerous cave dwellings, they finally reached the main hall at the summit. Inside, several groups of people—each numbering from dozens to a hundred—were already waiting. Over a dozen Golden Core cultivators were discussing matters at the front, and when they saw Yan Yuanchun, they greeted her warmly, indicating familiarity.

"Since Junior Sister Yan has arrived, all the local remnants are accounted for. Let's proceed with the return ceremony," said a middle-aged man in black robes at the center. Based on the others' addresses, he was the current Sect Master of the Black Lotus Sect, a Golden Core late-stage expert nearing Nascent Soul. In the absence of Nascent Soul elders, he was the highest authority leading the sect.

"Senior Brother Sect Master, isn't this ceremony a bit too perfunctory with just us?" Yan Yuanchun asked.

"Necessity dictates simplicity," the Sect Master replied. "The journey from the Lu Kingdom to the Great Song spans countless mountains and rivers. Reinforcements are still arriving in waves, and our manpower in the East Sea is stretched thin. We must make do for now."

The Sect Master offered a slight apology, but the other local Golden Core cultivators, having hidden for so long, were just relieved to finally have a strong backing and raised no further objections.

The six Golden Core remnants and their hundreds of followers completed a series of rituals—ancestral worship, Buddhist homage, and reciting sect rules—before officially rejoining the Black Lotus Sect. Surprisingly, the sect had no prohibitions against alcohol, meat, or relationships, focusing solely on venerating the "Black Lotus Buddha."

That's right—not worship, but veneration.

The sect's cultivators were tasked with spreading faith among mortals, though who ultimately reaped the benefits of this devotion was not to be questioned. Beyond this peculiarity, the sect seemed no different from others—members were expected to support one another, avoid infighting, and focus on proselytizing.

Lin Shan, standing among the crowd, was baffled. Was this really the demonic sect infamous for blood sacrifices and internal strife? It felt more like a pyramid scheme.

Unaware of Lin Shan's thoughts, the Sect Master continued assigning roles: "Nascent Soul elders are titled Dharma Kings, Golden Core cultivators are Protectors, Foundation Establishment cultivators are Envoys, and Qi Refining cultivators are Disciples."

After a lengthy explanation, Yan Yuanchun's five Foundation Establishment subordinates, including Lin Shan, were all designated as "Altar-Cleansing Envoys."

Lin Shan frowned. The term sounded vaguely familiar, but he couldn't quite place it. Then it hit him—wasn't this the title given to Zhu Bajie, the Pig Demon, after the Journey to the West?

What kind of role was this? Were they supposed to... clean up after feasts?
