# Chapter 21: The Shocked Chen Family! The Chen Family's Compensation!

"What?!"

"Lu Yunfeng is dead?!"

"What?!"

"Lin Yun is a supreme talisman genius?! With a twenty percent success rate in crafting high-grade primary talismans?!"

"Who is Lin Yun?"

"What?!"

"That wandering cultivator who was once involved with Qiaoqian?!"

"Senior Brother Sect Master, wait a moment!" The Chen Family Head scratched his head frantically. "There's too much information in what you're saying—my brain can't process it all!"

Just then, an elderly cultivator with white hair and a blue robe walked out, radiating vitality.

"Greetings, Ancestor!"

"Greetings, Uncle Chen!"

Zhong Lingdao and the Chen Family Head bowed in respect.

"Look at the mess you've made!" The old man immediately began scolding harshly.

The Chen Family Head replied awkwardly, "We had no idea that kid was a talisman genius back then!"

"And regarding the marriage alliance with the Lu Family's Wind Spirit Root, didn't you also agree to it, Elder?" This thought remained unspoken in the Chen Family Head's mind.

Instead, he quickly nodded and apologized, "Yes, yes—"

"Ancestor, it was my fault for failing to recognize true talent!"

"All of this is my mistake!"

"Hmph—" The Chen Family Ancestor snorted coldly before turning to Zhong Lingdao. "I've also received Junior Brother Li's message talisman, so I roughly understand the situation."

"Ah—who could have imagined that Lin Yun would turn out to be a supreme talisman genius!" the elderly cultivator sighed.

"Indeed, who would have thought a mere wandering cultivator could be a talisman genius? If not for the Masked Moon Sect's Golden Core ancestor noticing it, we would still be in the dark." Zhong Lingdao naturally wouldn't dare speak ill of a Golden Core cultivator and could only echo the sentiment.

As for the purpose of his visit to the Chen Family, it was simple.

After discussions among the Golden Core cultivators of the valley, it was decided that they would spare no effort to recruit Lin Yun.

Although Lin Yun had a conflict with the Chen Family, he had a past connection with Chen Qiaoqian!

Moreover, since the Dong Family's Dong Xuan'er had already made the first move, the Yellow Maple Valley still had a chance to win Lin Yun over.

Of course, given the messy history between Lin Yun and the Chen Family, they would have to pay a much higher price to succeed.

When it came to matters of benefit, whoever caused the trouble had to bear the responsibility.

Thus, Zhong Lingdao had come.

"Junior Sect Master, rest assured. Our Chen Family will take full responsibility for this matter."

With that, he tossed a storage pouch to Zhong Lingdao.

"This contains a talisman treasure personally refined by me—the Golden Book and Silver Brush. Additionally, there are two bottles of Foundation Establishment Pills, various Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment elixirs from our family's reserves, and finally, thirty thousand spirit stones!"

As he listed these items, the Chen Family Ancestor's heart bled with every word.

---

The Chen Family, though one of the three great families of the Yellow Maple Valley with vast wealth and income, also had enormous expenditures. Giving away these resources was truly like cutting off a piece of their flesh.

More importantly, as a family affiliated with the Yellow Maple Valley, most of their income had to be handed over—ultimately distributed among other Golden Core cultivators and the Grand Elder.

Unlike independent families like the Yan Family, who kept all their earnings for themselves.

Beside him, the Chen Family Head's mouth hung open in shock. Was it really necessary to go this far?

The Golden Book and Silver Brush talisman treasure—none of their own Chen Family members were even qualified to use it!

The talisman treasures they currently used were all purchased from outside!

As for the two bottles of Foundation Establishment Pills—ten pills in total! If used wisely, they could help ten more clansmen reach Foundation Establishment!

The cultivation elixirs went without saying—the Chen Family itself was already tightening their belts, facing severe shortages. And the thirty thousand spirit stones? As the esteemed head of the Chen Family, his annual income—including his share from the family, his position in the Yellow Maple Valley (which granted him one mid-grade spirit stone per year), and additional earnings and tributes from subordinates—barely exceeded three thousand spirit stones!

Now, they were giving Lin Yun thirty thousand spirit stones!

That was equivalent to ten years of his own income!

A full decade!

Do you have any idea how I've suffered these past ten years?

Why should he get so much?

I refuse to accept this!

And what could a mere Qi Refining cultivator possibly need with so many spirit stones?!

"Ancestor, isn't this—" The Chen Family Head had just begun to voice his objections when he was immediately cut off with a sharp rebuke: "Shut your mouth!"

"Talisman crafting consumes vast resources! These thirty thousand spirit stones will barely be enough for Young Friend Lin to advance to an intermediate talisman master. Our Chen Family will provide him with an additional ten thousand spirit stones annually to purchase materials for practice!"

Even if it took hundreds of thousands of spirit stones to nurture an intermediate talisman master, given Lin Yun's talent, it was entirely possible!

"Excellent! Uncle Chen is truly generous! I'll inform Uncle Li immediately!" Zhong Lingdao nodded in satisfaction.

With the Chen Family offering such terms, no other sect could possibly compete with the Yellow Maple Valley in recruiting Lin Yun.

As for why the Chen Family Ancestor was willing to pay such a steep price to bring the man who had killed their "son-in-law" Lu Yunfeng into the sect, Zhong Lingdao understood perfectly!

Rumors said that this supreme talisman genius had once shared a past with their Chen Family's Chen Qiaoqian... It seemed they were now setting their sights on him again.

If Lin Yun were merely an ordinary high-grade primary talisman master, he wouldn't be worth such effort.

But Lin Yun's talent was extraordinary!

High-grade primary talismans might not even be his limit—he could very well advance to low-grade, mid-grade, or even high-grade intermediate talisman mastery!

---

For the Yellow Maple Valley and the Chen Family, that would be an immense gain!

Currently, aside from extremely rare sects like the Myriad Wonders Sect that specialized in talismans, high-grade intermediate talisman masters in other sects were all Nascent Soul cultivators!

And that was only if the Nascent Soul cultivator had the talent for it.

As far as they knew, none of the seven major sects of the Yue Kingdom had a single Nascent Soul ancestor who was a high-grade intermediate talisman master.

Legends said that among the six great demonic sects of the Heavenly Luo Country, the sect master of the Blazing Flame Sect—a Nascent Soul cultivator—was a high-grade intermediate talisman master.

If Lin Yun could truly reach that level, it would be as if the Yellow Maple Valley had gained an additional Nascent Soul cultivator!

Of course, this was all just speculation.

Becoming a high-grade intermediate talisman master was no simple feat. Even if Lin Yun had the ability, the Yellow Maple Valley couldn't possibly afford the materials required.

Their expectations for Lin Yun were much more modest—reaching low-grade intermediate talisman mastery would already be more than enough.

Among Foundation Establishment cultivators, that alone would be an incredible achievement.

In the neighboring Myriad Wonders Sect, low-grade intermediate talisman masters were all Golden Core cultivators, while mid-grade intermediate talisman masters were at the late Golden Core stage!

As for Lin Yun reaching Golden Core... Given his Five Spiritual Roots, Zhong Lingdao thought it would be harder than ascending to heaven.

"Ancestor, even if Lin Yun is a talisman genius, why must our Chen Family pay such an exorbitant price?" The Chen Family Head looked at his ancestor in confusion. The family was bleeding far too much this time.

"Fool!" the Chen Family Ancestor scolded.

Being berated yet unable to show displeasure, the Chen Family Head could only accept it humbly. "Please enlighten me, Ancestor."

"If Qiaoqian weren't still useful and your daughter, I would have stripped you of your position long ago!" The Chen Family Ancestor spoke with exasperation. "Think about it—Lin Yun is a wandering cultivator with no connections in the Yellow Maple Valley. If he joins, who would he be closest to?"

"Of course, it would be Qiaoqian!" the Chen Family Ancestor declared bluntly.

"Oh—"

The Chen Family Head's mouth fell open as realization dawned. "Ancestor, you are truly wise!"

This time, in inviting Lin Yun to join the Yellow Maple Valley, the Chen Family Ancestor had played a pivotal role.

After praising his ancestor, the family head voiced another concern: "But Ancestor, isn't Dong Xuan'er from the Dong Family also very close to Lin Yun? And she has ties to Elder Hong Fu—could we be working for someone else's benefit?"

"No need to worry about that! Lin Yun is dashingly handsome, a peerless beauty among men." The Chen Family Ancestor spoke with absolute confidence.

"Ah?" The Chen Family Head scratched his head in confusion. "Isn't that a bad thing? Wouldn't that make it worse?!"

"You—"

"Ah, forget it. Elder Hong Fu has been in seclusion frequently in recent years, rarely appearing in public. It's no surprise you don't know."

"Elder Hong Fu despises handsome men above all else—especially one as exceptionally good-looking as Lin Yun!"

"So you have nothing to worry about on that front!"

"Once Lin Yun enters the valley, take good care of him and fulfill all his needs!"

With that, the Chen Family Ancestor vanished.

"As you command, Ancestor!" The Chen Family Head bowed deeply.
