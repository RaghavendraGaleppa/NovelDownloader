# Chapter 122: My Lord, Please Don't!

Lin Shan's thoughts immediately began to wander—if summoning magic could summon people, then wouldn't it mean that the next time he got beaten up, he could just call for backup?

Thinking it, he acted on it.

He immediately activated the summoning spell and the summoning flag, and his consciousness arrived once more at the fishing village on the northern part of the island. Among tens of thousands of green light dots, he found over a dozen larger, darker green ones.

As he examined each of these larger dots one by one, he realized they were all his Qi Condensation stage subordinates. Lin Shan directly selected over a dozen mid-Qi Condensation stage followers and began binding them with the summoning spell.

At the same time, in a fishing village on the eastern side of the island...

A group of cultivators were diligently preaching to mortals on a country path when they suddenly felt as if something had locked onto their souls from the void!

Instantly, the hairs on their bodies stood on end, and they frantically looked around but found nothing.

Yet in the next moment, they felt as if an invisible hand was gently caressing their souls, as though trying to implant something into their minds.

The soul was the most crucial aspect of a cultivator—in other words, it was also the most sensitive part.

To have the most sensitive part of oneself suddenly and inexplicably caressed by an unknown force—anyone would find it unbearable!

The group of cultivators immediately felt an unbearable itch all over their bodies, as if some unknown hormone was being secreted wildly. It was as though that invisible hand was continuously stimulating their G-spots, causing them to hunch over and moan in resistance.

"My soul—someone is—"

"Which senior is playing such a joke on me?"

"Ah! No! I don't have that kind of fetish!"

...

The mortal fishermen in front of them were dumbfounded.

Weren't these immortal masters just moments ago preaching to them with solemn expressions? Why had their faces suddenly turned so... ambiguous?

Meanwhile, on the other side of the island, Lin Shan felt immense resistance. Humans, as advanced primates, possessed intelligence far beyond that of demonic beasts. Moreover, having cultivated to the Qi Condensation stage, their souls had already strengthened after spiritual transformation.

However, with his Foundation Establishment stage spiritual sense, forcibly breaking through wasn't impossible. But doing so violently would carry a small risk of destroying their consciousness, reducing them to a mindless state akin to demonic beasts.

After all, these were his own subordinates. There was no need to be so ruthless. If by some small chance their consciousness was erased, wouldn't they just become walking corpses?

Besides, there was no need to burden his own soul unnecessarily.

Lin Shan decided to stop and pondered for a moment before taking out a stack of communication talismans. After murmuring something into them, he tossed them away.

...

A short while later, over a dozen cultivators came running from the distance. Having received Lin Shan's message, they hurried over to complain tearfully.

"My lord, we've finally found you!"

"Just now, some strange thing tried to invade our souls."

"Wuwu! I almost lost my virtue!"

"My lord, please seek justice for us!"

...

Lin Shan guiltily comforted them, assuring them he would investigate the matter and that they need not worry.

He then told them to line up, explaining that he had called them to test a spell. He instructed them not to resist, as it wouldn't pose any threat, and promised them a low-grade magical artifact each as a reward.

After much coaxing, the group of subordinates finally calmed down and obediently lined up in front of him.

But in the next instant, all of them suddenly turned pale!

Oh no! That feeling again!

It was as if they were completely naked, with countless rough hands rudely caressing their delicate souls. And the source of all this was none other than...

The Demonic Sect's envoy—their lord!

At this moment, Lin Shan sat cross-legged on a reef, a flag tucked under his arm, his sharp gaze fixed on them, a faint hint of excitement at the corners of his lips. To an outsider, it might seem like he had some perverse intentions.

The dozen or so subordinates in front of him were in turmoil, their emotions a tangled mess.

"So the culprit was our lord?"

"What... what does he want?"

"If it's what the lord desires, should I give in or not?"

"This is a golden opportunity! If I can cling to his coattails, what's the harm in selling myself?"

"Alas, my first time is actually on a deserted island in the wild seas... and in a group activity?"

...

Meanwhile, Lin Shan's forehead veins bulged with exertion. The resistance was still so intense! He wasn't going to harm them—why were they making such expressions?

Unable to hold back, he roared, "Stop resisting!"

All the subordinates sighed in resignation. Knowing they couldn't escape their fate, they might as well submit for the sake of their lives.

In an instant, a contract symbol was implanted into each of their minds, settling deep within their souls and faintly glowing.

Exhausted, Lin Shan finally relaxed. It was done.

Fortunately, it was just a summoning contract, not some soul enslavement, so it posed no real threat to them.

He casually tossed each of them a low-grade magical artifact—he had plenty of these from the Black and Red Twin Fiends' storage bags, so he didn't mind the loss.

"You may leave now."

The dozen subordinates stood there dumbfounded, unsure what to do.

...

Wait, that's it?

We were all mentally prepared, and now it's just over?

Still, not having to sacrifice their chastity was certainly something to celebrate. As for the mark planted in their souls, they naturally assumed it was some demonic enslavement technique. As they left, each wore a troubled expression, their faces bitter.

Lin Shan couldn't help but scoff. With their level of cultivation, he wouldn't even bother enslaving them! They were really getting too into the act!

But he didn't bother explaining. As their leader, he didn't owe them a report for everything. They just needed to obediently work hard.

...

Half a quarter-hour later, estimating they had gone far enough, Lin Shan activated the summoning spell again. The flag in his hand fluttered in the wind, and a green vortex appeared out of thin air.

With a shake of the flag, the vortex spat out the same dozen subordinates one after another—they had truly been summoned!

The group was utterly bewildered, looking around in confusion. They had clearly returned to the same spot they'd been in half a quarter-hour ago. Seeing their envoy still seated on the reef, he waved his hand dismissively at them.

"You may leave now!"

The group suddenly felt as though they had traveled through time, experiencing an overwhelming sense of déjà vu.

Had they just time-traveled? Had time reset and reversed?

Or had they just experienced an illusion? But why didn't they receive any magical artifacts this time?

Baffled, the subordinates once again set off on their way back.

...

Over the following period, Lin Shan took the opportunity to bind summoning contracts with all his remaining subordinates.

Since the summoning flag was a mid-grade magical artifact, Foundation Establishment stage demonic beasts couldn't withstand it, and Qi Condensation stage demonic beasts lacked intelligence, making them less useful than Qi Condensation stage cultivators.

While binding the summoning contracts with the other subordinates, each of them wailed as if enduring some unspeakable torment.

The only one who remained relatively calm was Old Man Zhong.

When Lin Shan implanted the soul contract in Old Man Zhong, the old man didn't cry or shout. Instead, he merely gave Lin Shan a slightly surprised glance before silently accepting the binding.

For a fleeting moment, Lin Shan felt a strange palpitation—as if he had just bound some prehistoric monstrosity!

But according to the summoning spell's description, the summoned creature's cultivation couldn't exceed his own. Moreover, he could faintly sense that if he willed it, the summoning contracts in all hundred-plus people would respond. Thus, he set his mind at ease.

How could a bunch of Qi Condensation stage cultivators make him feel uneasy? It must have just been an illusion from binding too many people at once.

...

However, there was one detail Lin Shan overlooked.

The summoning spell could indeed only forcibly bind creatures whose cultivation didn't exceed his own—after all, if their souls were stronger than his, forcibly binding them would be suicidal.

But in theory, if the target didn't resist and actively accepted the contract, this rule no longer applied.

The only limitation then would be whether the summoning flag's grade could handle it.
