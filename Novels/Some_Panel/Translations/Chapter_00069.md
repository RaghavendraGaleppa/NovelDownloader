# Chapter 68: The Golden Core is Formed

“Indeed, the Dao Sect is very generous. If they treat the sects behind their disciples with such benevolence, one can imagine how they treat their inner disciples.”

Jianyuanzi smiled, “As long as you have the ability, the entire Dao Sect has endless resources for you to claim.”

“After Changxiao passes the second assessment, he can cultivate in the Limitless Dao Sect for a hundred years. Only after a hundred years will he undergo the third assessment.”

“If he passes, it will be the beginning of Changxiao’s immortal path and a blessing for our sect.”

“Disciple, you must also work hard.”

“Master, rest assured, I will definitely work hard,” Yang Ji nodded.

How could he not work hard? The Dao Sect was a powerful aid for him to step onto the immortal path. He was determined to stay within it.

Afterward, he chatted with Jianyuanzi for a while, then walked out of the grand hall to clear his mind and get some fresh air.

While strolling within the sect, he encountered True Monarch Qinghe. He was the only Grandmaster Alchemist in the Canglan Sect, and all the Demon Core Pills Yang Ji had consumed since joining the sect were refined by him.

The pills contained no impurities and no residual demonic energy, clearly indicating that True Monarch Qinghe’s alchemy attainments had reached an extremely profound level.

Refining Demonic Essence Pills must be second nature to him.

As soon as he saw Yang Ji, he enthusiastically greeted him, smiling, “Martial Nephew, a batch of high-grade Demon-Companion Grass and demon cores just arrived from the Demonic Beast Sea. I see you’re relaxing, why not come to the Pill Hall with your Martial Uncle?”

“Learning a few alchemy techniques from your Martial Uncle will be very beneficial when you go to the Dao Sect later,” he chuckled.

Seeing this, Yang Ji also smiled, “Then I shall follow Martial Uncle to have a look. It would be my honor if I could learn a bit of alchemy from Martial Uncle.”

“Haha, then let’s go! Martial Uncle will surely teach you everything I know,” True Monarch Qinghe laughed heartily, then grabbed Yang Ji and flew towards the Pill Hall.

Inside the Pill Hall.

True Monarch Qinghe refined pills while Yang Ji watched intently.

As the two conversed back and forth, True Monarch Qinghe was surprised to find that Yang Ji was deeply knowledgeable in the Dao of Alchemy, with quite profound attainments.

True Monarch Qinghe's one-sided instruction gradually shifted into a discussion.

The more they discussed, the more astonished he became by Yang Ji’s attainments in alchemy. Yang Ji had a clear understanding of medicinal principles and properties, and his control over heat and the fusion of various medicinal liquids was almost perfect. He was truly a Grandmaster Alchemist.

True Monarch Qinghe even suspected Yang Ji might be a Pill Saint.

So outstanding! Regardless of the age of the medicinal ingredients or how they were combined, he could always use the optimal medicinal liquid ratios to refine pills of the highest quality, with a 100% success rate. This was simply astounding.

True Monarch Qinghe was astonished and delved into in-depth discussions and research with Yang Ji.

Yang Ji also found that True Monarch Qinghe truly lived up to his title as a Grandmaster Alchemist, being highly knowledgeable and skilled in alchemy far beyond ordinary people, adept at drawing inferences from one instance to others, and possessing a broad mindset.

During their discussions, Yang Ji also learned a great deal.

The two stayed in the Pill Hall for a year. During this period, Yang Ji and True Monarch Qinghe jointly perfected many pill formulas, numbering over a hundred, from Demonic Essence Pills to Spiritual Qi Pills and beyond.

They made perfect annotations on how to combine medicinal ingredients of various ages and provided a perfectly appropriate range of ratios.

It made it easy for anyone to learn, as if one were refining pills by following a formula.

Yang Ji perfecting numerous pill formulas was also a way to repay the Canglan Sect. With these formulas, the pills refined would be better, and the sect’s overall strength would see a slight improvement.

It was precisely because of this that Yang Ji's identity as a Grandmaster Alchemist quickly spread among the various Nascent Soul True Monarchs.

They were immensely surprised, never expecting their sect’s quasi-Void Refinement seed to also be an alchemist.

Possessing such ability, even if his comprehension and talent were not outstanding, the treatment he would enjoy within the sect would be on par with that of a Nascent Soul True Monarch.

Everyone wanted to personally witness Yang Ji refining pills, but they went to the Pill Hall and found it empty.

Because at this moment, Yang Ji had already returned to Sword Dao Peak and resumed his closed-door cultivation.

Two years swiftly passed.

Yang Ji’s cultivation had already reached the peak of Foundation Establishment.

[Cultivation: Foundation Establishment Peak (819200/819200)]

At this moment, the True Adamant Divine Art was continuously circulating, and the spiritual energy vortex was furiously refining the spiritual liquid.

The spiritual liquid within his Dantian began to boil.

In an instant, the Dantian glowed brightly, with threads of golden light emerging. This was True Qi, born after the spiritual liquid had been purified countless times.

True Qi was the essence of spiritual liquid, currently undergoing frantic refinement and transformation.

This golden True Qi was the unique True Qi cultivated by the True Adamant Divine Art, resembling drawn metal wire, each strand giving a sensation of sharpness, hardness, and profound weight.

Unable to contain himself, Yang Ji immediately conjured a wisp. A golden energy blade shot out from his hand and slashed at the wall of his cultivation chamber.

*Pfft!*

Stone chips flew, and a half-foot-long mark appeared on the surface of the tough Black Adamantite, its edges sharp as if cut by a knife.

Yang Ji retracted his True Qi with a flick of his hand and slashed again.

*Pfft pfft pfft!*

The True Qi, like a blade, cut into the Black Adamantite, carving out countless crisscrossing slash marks, a truly shocking sight.

“True Qi is like a blade, far more powerful than spiritual energy. Simply transforming True Qi into a dense energy net to attack could shred an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator into a pulp. If I use True Qi to perform sword moves, the power would probably increase several, even tens of times, compared to sword moves unleashed with spiritual energy.”

Yang Ji’s heart swelled with joy. One must know that True Qi was one of the powerful symbols of a Golden Core True Person.

He had now touched upon it, because he was attempting to break through to this realm.

At this moment, the Dao-tier cultivation method, True Adamant Divine Art, finally demonstrated its extraordinary qualities. The golden True Qi cultivated by it was of extremely high quality. Whether in terms of purity or power, it was several, even tens of times better than the True Qi cultivated by ordinary top-tier methods.

The golden True Qi went from the first wisp born, to the second, and eventually, more and more appeared.

A year later, the entire Dantian was bathed in golden light.

Golden True Qi, crisscrossing like golden silkworm threads, filled every corner. These golden True Qi strands intertwined, instantly forming a dazzling ball of light.

The golden True Qi compressed at an extreme speed, compressing and re-compressing, condensing and re-condensing.

This condensed and compressed golden True Qi was precisely the nascent form of the Golden Core.

As it was compressed to its utmost, the True Qi light mass vaguely showed signs of forming a core.

It was also during this extreme compression that the True Qi continuously squeezed and collided, actually sparking flames! *Boom!* A ball of flame erupted from within the True Qi light mass.

This flame was a faint yellow, emitting terrifying high temperatures. As soon as it appeared, even Yang Ji himself felt a scorching heat.

But seeing this flame, a smile appeared on his face.

This fire was the Samadhi True Fire, ignited by the collision of True Qi. The appearance of this fire meant that the True Qi light mass had been compressed and refined almost completely, and was about to form a Golden Core.

Samadhi True Fire, besides True Qi, was another powerful symbol of a Golden Core True Person.

With this fire, he could finally refine his own Natal Magic Tool.

Gazing at the flames, the smile on Yang Ji’s face quickly receded as he began to fully concentrate on compressing the True Qi light mass and breaking through the realm.

Three days later.

*Om!*

A vibrating sound, like the striking of a metal steel ball, reverberated from within his Dantian. Along with this vibration, the True Qi light mass within Yang Ji’s body burst into a brilliant golden light.

As the vibration slowly faded, as the golden light gradually diminished.

Finally, all the golden light contracted into a fist-sized golden sphere within his Dantian.

*Om om om!*

As the last faint vibration disappeared, the golden sphere stopped trembling, and the yellow flames flickering on its surface completely receded.

Yang Ji looked at the golden sphere within his Dantian, at this golden sphere that contained immense energy, like a nuclear bomb, and finally, a brilliant smile appeared on his face.

The Golden Core was finally formed!
