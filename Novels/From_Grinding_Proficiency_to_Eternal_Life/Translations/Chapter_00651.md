# Chapter 651: Seizing the Opportunity to Rise

Xu Yunfan did not hesitate for a moment.

He transformed into a tear of purple-gold thunder that ripped through the void, no longer concealing his aura or form. With the three main gods already present and the True Lord of Qingyuan watching from above, most of the gods in the great war had fallen into a frenzy of slaughter, their madness beginning to fade.

Xu Yunfan naturally needed to seize the time and proactively charge toward the most chaotic core of the battlefield.

There, a mid-tier god of the Dawnlight from the Light God System was locked in a deadly duel with a mid-tier Shadow Erosion Serpent from the Darkness God System. The light from their clashing divine powers blotted out the sky for a hundred miles.

"洞冥蚀天，摄神夺魄." (Piercing the Nether, Devouring the Heaven, Seizing the God, Snatching the Soul.)

Xu Yunfan's left hand spread wide, and countless writhing, distorted Devouring Heaven Talismans surged like a black tide toward the Dawnlight. Ignoring its protective holy light, they rushed straight for its divine core.

Immediately after, his right hand formed a sword seal. Refined Wish Power white flames rose from the Divine Forge Cauldron, instantly condensing into a spear entangled with destructive purple-gold thunder. Carrying the aura of annihilation that could extinguish souls, it stabbed straight toward the seven-inch vital point of the Shadow Erosion Serpent.

Simultaneously, the Divine Forge Cauldron atop his head vibrated violently. The Wish Power white flames at its mouth surged, opening wide like the maw of a starving beast to frantically swallow the massive, chaotic streams of belief and Wish Power that ran wild as the many gods slain by Xu Yunfan completely perished.

"Heretic!"

"Blasphemer, die!"

Several high-tier gods from the Light and Dark factions were instantly enraged. Brilliant purifying holy light and shadow spears that devoured everything tore through space, striking from different directions in an instant.

Xu Yunfan neither dodged nor evaded. The Divine Thunder around his body exploded, and the violent thunderous power transformed into countless thunder snakes. They precisely struck the sides of the incoming attacks, causing their trajectories to deflect slightly. Several streams of divine power, enough to severely injure a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, narrowly brushed past him.

To Xu Yunfan now, this was merely a breeze against his face.

It was at this moment that the Devouring Heaven Talismans, like maggots in bone, had completely entangled the Dawnlight's divine core.

The Star Spirit Banner flashed with a dark light, and the mid-tier god's struggle instantly froze. Both body and soul were dragged ruthlessly into the world within the banner.

On the other side, the purple-gold thunder spear precisely pierced the core of the Shadow Erosion Serpent's divine core. The violent destructive thunder penetrated its body, instantly annihilating its soul.

Four more strands of pure Immortal Gold Essence, pulled by the牵引 of secret因果 techniques, were refined by the Divine Forge Cauldron and instantly merged into Xu Yunfan's Dantian.

Xu Yunfan did not pause. He immediately refined all the accumulated Immortal Gold Essence. However, out of the total thirteen strands, the wasteful process only managed to refine three in an instant.

The appearance of the True Lord of Qingyuan was truly ill-timed.

But then Xu Yunfan thought otherwise; the True Lord of Qingyuan had appeared at just the right moment.

Having claimed so many heads in this divine war, the main gods of the three great systems had most likely already sensed something was wrong.

According to Delis, even in the last Great God War, the death of thirty to forty gods was considered a very high number.

This time, over a dozen high-tier gods had died, far exceeding the limit.

How could those main gods not have noticed the anomaly?

'Great Array of the Zodiac Constellations (81/365)'

'...'

From the moment the True Lord of Qingyuan descended and broke through the realm, to Xu Yunfan detonating the restrictions on Buthus and the other two, enduring the main god's might while slaying two mid-tier gods—all of this happened in the blink of an eye.

At this time, Xu Yunfan glanced at the three main gods, then shifted his gaze to the True Lord of Qingyuan.

He would have to be careful if he were to make any further moves.

"There is no need to worry."

Zhang Ziyang's voice reached Xu Yunfan's ear.

"We belong to the outsider faction of Aetira. That True Lord of Qingyuan possesses the strongest power and poses the greatest threat to this world's Heavenly Dao. The divine authority and thrones are all bestowed by the heavens. The attention of the three main gods will be subconsciously drawn toward him."

Hearing this, a hint of excitement colored Zhang Ziyang's words.

"You still have a chance. The True Lord of Qingyuan is being locked down by the three main gods, which is why he hasn't acted immediately. After all, they are three beings comparable to a True Lord, and the True Lord of Qingyuan here is merely an outsider."

Xu Yunfan nodded, not responding via voice transmission.

Zhang Ziyang relied on his authority to convey information. Transmitting thoughts under the gaze of a True Lord was no different from trying to hide one's actions.

High above in the heavens, the True Lord of Qingyuan did not act immediately.

He stood at the edge of the shattered realm barrier, the pure aura of an immortal palace flowing around him. He looked down with great interest at Xu Yunfan, who was slaughtering gods like a madman below, a playful smile even curling his lips.

Without forming a Golden Core, no matter how monstrous a Foundation Establishment cultivator was, they were still just in Foundation Establishment.

But Xu Yunfan always managed to give him a fright.

Xu Yunfan's current unrestrained explosion of power allowed him to clearly sense the unique fluctuation of the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit slightly tugging within Xu Yunfan's body.

However, what surprised him was the incredibly vast amount of Immortal Gold Essence within Xu Yunfan's Dantian cave-heaven.

"Good! Very good!"

The True Lord of Qingyuan suppressed the shock in his heart and clapped his hands with a light laugh. His voice was not loud, yet it clearly overshadowed the roar of the divine war and the main gods.

"Thirty-six? Ninety? No, ninety-five? Tsk tsk, Xu Yunfan, you junior, have truly broadened this Lord's horizons. A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator actually managed to steal such a thick Immortal Foundation in this kind of world. No wonder you could evade Master Pudu's perception. Such scheming and methods, such ruthlessness. Truly worthy of being a disciple of my Primordial Origin Sect. Impressive!"

His tone carried a condescending critique, as if appreciating an interesting collection.

The same saying applied: he was in the Golden Core realm.

No matter how strong a Foundation Establishment cultivator was, they were still in Foundation Establishment.

His gaze swept over the three main god wills that were locking onto Xu Yunfan below, carrying undisguised contempt and indifference.

"Three false gods of a small world, possessing only authority but ignorant of the true essence of the Great Dao, dare to covet the prey this Lord has set his eyes on?"

Before the words had fully faded, he casually brushed his sleeve.

Hum!

An invisible pure energy, containing the principles of the universe and the operation of karma, swept over the chaotic battlefield.

The next instant, a scene that made Xu Yunfan's pupils contract violently appeared.

The will of the Light Main God, Olian, which had been locking onto Xu Yunfan, was forcibly deflected by an invisible force and then slammed violently into the Darkness Main God, Ymir, while the Darkness Main God Ymir crashed into the Sky Main God, Olian.

The Great Perfection of the Piercing the Nether, Devouring the Heaven Talisman technique could manipulate karma and deflect perception.

Great Perfection!

A tidal wave of shock surged through Xu Yunfan's heart.

He had cultivated the Piercing the Nether, Devouring the Heaven Talisman to perfection and could also deflect a creature's perception, but the targets were mostly peers or slightly stronger opponents. It required precise control and a significant expenditure of mental energy and spiritual power. If facing a strong-willed opponent, he also needed to rely on items carried by the target to strengthen the technique's power.

Yet the True Lord of Qingyuan's seemingly casual brush effortlessly deflected the wills of three main gods comparable to Golden Core True Lords.

As if moving three chess pieces on a board.

This was the true, terrifying might of the Piercing the Nether, Devouring the Heaven Talisman when cultivated to true Great Perfection and integrated into a Golden Core Dao Fruit.

To be honest, secret techniques like the Piercing the Nether, Devouring the Heaven Talisman that involve karma are extremely difficult to cultivate. If Xu Yunfan hadn't had the Attribute Panel to assist him, he would never have been able to cultivate it to the perfection realm.

He never expected that the True Lord of Qingyuan had actually cultivated this technique to a high level.
