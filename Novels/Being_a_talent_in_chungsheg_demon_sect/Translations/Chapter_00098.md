Chapter 98: Entering Buddhism with Nirvana

"Amitābha."

Under Lu Yang's gaze, the red-lipped, white-toothed youth smiled slightly, then pressed his palms together, his eyes glowing with golden light, staring intently at Lu Yang: "Benefactor, your talent is truly exceptional, a pleasant surprise to this monk."

"...Buddhist cultivator?"

Lu Yang raised an eyebrow. He had heard from Chen Xin'an that Buddhist cultivators did not exist in Jiangnan or Jiangbei. Even if they did, they were rogue cultivators like the previous Mingchan. True Buddhist cultivators were all in Jiangxi. Their cultivation path was not the "Body Refinement Ascension Dao" but the "Deep Joy Nirvana Dao", said to possess unique mysteries, vastly different from those of Jiangnan and Jiangbei. Especially the current True Human Panlong; his cultivation was similar to that of the Heaven Mending Peak Lord, yet unlike the Peak Lord, he hadn't been wounded by Golden Core sword qi. His spirit and flesh were complete, and he was in his peak state, his aura encompassing the universe, vast as the heavens. This immediately made Lu Yang understand why the Heaven Mending Peak Lord had been so aggrieved earlier.

"This monk is Fulong."

The youth exhaled slowly, saying indifferently, "Panlong has entered nirvana, reborn in the Pure Land. All past matters are no longer relevant to this monk. In this world, there is only Fulong."

Lu Yang's expression was equally calm: "Then, Senior Fulong, why have you come to find me at this moment?"

Even as he spoke, he continued to construct his Dao foundation. However, he found that the foundation, which had been so easy to build moments ago, now felt as difficult as walking with a heavy burden.

'...Is it that dragon?' Lu Yang's gaze shifted to the small dragon coiled around Fulong Arhat. He saw that its golden dragon eyes remained fixed on him.

Fulong Arhat smiled slightly at this. His companion small dragon, though appearing alive, was in fact a supreme spiritual treasure named the 'Dragon Binding Ring'. Its divine ability was called 'Frame the Universe'. As the name suggested, as long as something was seen by it, it would be fixed within its field of vision, unable to leave or transform. Because when Lu Yang was first seen by it, he had not yet established his Dao foundation. Thus, no matter how Lu Yang circulated his divine abilities at this moment, his Dao foundation would be held in place by its gaze, difficult to condense, and he couldn't seize the opportunity to escape elsewhere.

"This monk has come to offer the benefactor an opportunity." Fulong Arhat observed Lu Yang, continuing, "After this monk entered nirvana and attained Arhatship, I established a pagoda temple in the Pure Land, named the [Fulong Temple]."

"The temple is newly established and still lacks a Buddhist congregation."

"Benefactor, your True Qi has reached the pinnacle. If you join my temple, you can serve as a Vajra Protector. From now on, you will cultivate the Nirvana Dao alongside this monk. Wouldn't that be wonderful?"

Boom! Before Fulong Arhat's words had even finished, Lu Yang's figure flickered, then vanished from his original spot, replaced by a bewildered witch-ghost. Fulong Arhat was momentarily stunned, evidently not expecting Lu Yang to break free from the 'Dragon Binding Ring's' restraint. However, he quickly smoothed his brow and laughed heartily: "Benefactor, why be so stubborn? You cultivate the Nine Transformations Dragon Art; you are naturally fated with this monk and with the Pure Land."

"Fated my ass!"

Within the Foundation Establishment realm, Lu Yang cursed silently as he fled. Fulong Arhat was clearly not here with good intentions; how could he possibly surrender without a fight?

"I was still too careless!"

As Lu Yang fled, regret churned in his heart. He had actually considered that the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art' might have issues, especially with Liu Xin's past example. However, firstly, True Human Panlong was already a dead man in his eyes at the time. Secondly, in his previous life, he had attempted Foundation Establishment, and True Human Panlong hadn't come knocking back then, so he had let his guard down... Now that he thought about it, it was probably because in his previous life, he had broken through within the Saint Sect!

"Damn it, they're all beasts!"

"Is there really no one decent in the Saint Sect who genuinely cares for their descendants? And what 'Vajra Protector'? Don't tell me they want to refine me into a puppet!?"

With a thought, Lu Yang immediately exited the Foundation Establishment realm.

The next second, Lu Yang emerged with the power of 'Heaven's Collapse', and the eight hundred li Skull Mountain instantly began to shake violently, as if an earth dragon was turning over.

"Fighting in the Foundation Establishment realm would surely mean my death." Lu Yang accepted reality. He hadn't yet established his Dao foundation. Inside the Foundation Establishment realm, he would need to resist the heart demons' intrusion every single second. How could he fight under such circumstances? Therefore, he could only return to the real world first, find a way to escape or repel Fulong Arhat, before he could continue his attempt at Foundation Establishment. Otherwise, it would be a dead end.

"Escaping wasn't realistic. I have divine talismans to conceal karma, yet that bald donkey still managed to find me, which means he has a way to bypass karma and directly pinpoint me through a connection from the cultivation method. Under these circumstances, it's impossible for me to escape. Moreover, Skull Mountain is my home ground; escaping would make it even more dangerous."

Thinking this, Lu Yang made up his mind: "...I'll fight him!"

Although he could restart, the [Book of Hundred Lifetimes] had limited pages. He wouldn't easily restart unless he was in a truly desperate situation, pushed to the very brink. Besides, even if he were to restart, for the sake of the next life, he should try his best to probe True Human Panlong's methods.

The next second, Fulong Arhat's figure emerged, also carrying the power of Heaven's Collapse. However, he was a true Foundation Establishment cultivator, and the phenomenon he created was different from Lu Yang's.

He lowered his eyelids, calmly sweeping his gaze across Skull Mountain. In an instant, the eight hundred li Skull Mountain was entirely within his sight. The invisible immense pressure from a Foundation Establishment True Human instantly descended upon every cultivator within Skull Mountain. Rumble! In a flash, cultivators below the late Qi Refinement stage were directly crushed into dust by this pressure. Those in the late Qi Refinement stage immediately prostrated themselves on the ground, vomiting blood ceaselessly. Only cultivators at the Great Perfection of Qi Refinement, seemingly still valuable, were not heavily injured. Instead, they suddenly pressed their palms together, inexplicably chanting Buddhist scriptures.

At the same time, Lu Yang shook the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner. His Dharma Protector, Su Nü, immediately appeared, leading eight red-robed ghosts to circulate their divine abilities. The majestic and grand [Yama Hall] instantly rose from the ground, towering over the sky. The Yin evil energy from Skull Mountain's earth脉 was continuously drawn out by him to empower his divine abilities.

Fulong Arhat clicked his tongue in admiration upon seeing this: "Once the benefactor enters my temple and becomes a Vajra Protector, this one can also serve as a female devotee in my temple, enjoying ultimate bliss alongside the benefactor. It would be a fated encounter."

Boom! Lu Yang completely ignored Fulong Arhat's words. The moment the [Yama Hall] appeared, he lifted it and sent it smashing down towards Fulong Arhat's head!

Fulong Arhat neither dodged nor evaded. Instead, he simply raised a shimmering treasure light above his head, shaped like a magnificent canopy, firmly receiving the descending [Yama Hall]. The moment they collided, sparks and streaking fire shot out, scattering in all directions, causing Fulong Arhat's previously relaxed brows to furrow slightly.

"It seems ordinary methods won't be enough to subdue this person."

Although he said this, Fulong Arhat's heart swelled with delight. When he left behind the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art', he hadn't actually expected to catch any big fish. After all, the Heaven Mending Peak Lord knew his true nature and would never truly allow a Foundation Establishment seed to cultivate the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art' only to be ensnared by him and benefit the Jiangxi Buddhist cultivators. So, his initial expectations were very low; he wouldn't mind even if it was just someone attempting Foundation Establishment, even if there was only a ten percent chance. However, Lu Yang had far exceeded his expectations. He could tell at a glance that the opponent was a true Foundation Establishment seed, and even one of the best. If he could convert him, it would be of immense benefit to him! Not to mention, he even got a Dharma Protector Su Nü for free. Though a pseudo-Foundation Establishment was not as good as true Foundation Establishment, it was still quite good. Bringing both into his [Fulong Temple] would be enough to further his cultivation!

"Very well, then I shall employ more divine abilities."

Upon this thought, Fulong Arhat's expression immediately became solemn. He then pressed his palms together, and golden light steamed from beneath his feet, instantly filling more than half the sky. In the blink of an eye, the eight hundred li Skull Mountain, originally filled with surging Yin evil energy, transformed into a vast golden land. Within this golden land, a majestic, mountain-like temple rose from the ground, its doors wide open, revealing the appearance of its main hall, with a lotus platform at its head. Fulong Arhat's figure then flickered, landing upon the lotus platform within the temple. In an instant, brilliant light burst forth. Fulong Arhat sat upon the lotus platform, his right hand resting on his right knee, fingertips touching the ground to form a mudra. In a moment, thousands of rays of radiant light cascaded down. Wherever the radiant light passed, all defilement scattered, and all phenomena melted away. The eight hundred li of Yin evil energy in Skull Mountain was swept clean, and the [Yama Hall] collapsed with a rumble beneath the radiant light, like ice and snow melting in summer!
