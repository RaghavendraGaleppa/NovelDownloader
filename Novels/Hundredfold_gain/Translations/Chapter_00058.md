# Chapter 58: Advancing to High-Grade Talisman Master, Struck by Lightning (Seeking Favorites)

Half a month later, in the inner sect of Fengyue Sect, within Qi Chuan's high-grade first-tier cave abode.

Qi Chuan sat upright before a stone table, holding the Mystic Elephant Spirit Brush in hand. The brush tip danced swiftly across the talisman paper as a complex formation rapidly took shape. Extending his palm, he formed hand seals, channeling wisps of spiritual energy to complete the infusion.

[You have successfully drawn a high-grade first-tier Fireball Talisman. Triggering Hundredfold Critical Strike, you gained a hundredfold reward. Your experience and skill in drawing Fireball Talismans have improved, and you have advanced to become a high-grade first-tier Talisman Master.]

As the infusion concluded, these words slowly appeared before Qi Chuan's eyes.

"Directly to high-grade?" Staring at the message, Qi Chuan was momentarily stunned before breaking into a smile.

After advancing to mid-grade first-tier Talisman Master, he had planned to take things slowly, not expecting to reach high-grade anytime soon. Yet today, the Hundredfold Critical Strike had propelled him directly to this level—an unexpected delight.

Closing his eyes briefly, Qi Chuan focused on absorbing the surge of talisman-crafting knowledge flooding his mind. Moments later, having fully assimilated the insights, he reopened his eyes.

Now, he could distinctly feel that his skill in crafting Fireball Talismans had unequivocally reached the high-grade first-tier level. If he wished, he could immediately produce another high-grade Fireball Talisman.

"However... I've completely exhausted my talisman paper and ink. Not a scrap left." Qi Chuan's gaze shifted to the stone table before him.

Apart from the freshly crafted high-grade Fireball Talisman—enhanced by the Hundredfold Critical Strike—the table's edge was lined with stacks of mid-grade first-tier talismans. Fireball Talismans, Water Arrow Talismans, Golden Skin Talismans... a complete assortment, numbering around two hundred.

These were the fruits of Qi Chuan's labor over the past half-month. It was through crafting these two hundred-plus mid-grade talismans—each stroke honing his skills under the critical strike enhancements—that he had finally triggered the Hundredfold Critical Strike, propelling him to high-grade mastery.

Yet, to produce these talismans, Qi Chuan had been forced to replenish his ink and paper supplies from the Treasure Pavilion, depleting his already meager reserves of spirit stones and contribution points. Only a handful of low-grade spirit stones remained.

Advancing the second layer of the Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body required spirit stones, and his cultivation progress still relied on Gathering Essence Pills. Now, his only hope was to sell these talismans for some income.

"But where should I sell them?"

Qi Chuan concluded that the marketplace would be best. However, he couldn't return to the rudimentary market near Black Serpent City—it was neither safe nor bustling enough for good sales. 

Fengyue Sect operated numerous markets within its domain, which were both secure and frequented by cultivators. Disciples from the sect's inner and outer circles, clan cultivators, and even rogue cultivators all frequented these markets for their needs.

"Time to set off. But before selling the talismans, I need to visit the Alchemy Pavilion to retrieve the Black Jade Bone-Mending Pills I commissioned. Then, through the Internal Affairs Hall, I'll send them back to Red Maple Valley for Second Uncle."

Rising, Qi Chuan gathered the talismans from the table and exited his cave abode.

Some time later, at the foot of White Moon Mountain, ten miles west of Fengyue Sect.

Qi Chuan gazed up at the unremarkable hill. Despite its plain appearance, it housed the White Moon Market—the nearest Fengyue Sect-affiliated marketplace.

Streaks of light occasionally descended onto the mountain's peak from the sky, though most visitors ascended via the Levitation Technique. After a brief observation, Qi Chuan too levitated upwards, soon arriving at the market's entrance.

The marketplace sprawled across a vast, naturally flat mountaintop, further smoothed by spells to form an expansive platform. Over a dozen streets crisscrossed the area, lined with shops and teeming with cultivators of varying backgrounds—sect disciples, clan members, and masked rogue cultivators alike.

Near the entrance, a shop sold masks. Qi Chuan purchased a bull-headed mask for one low-grade spirit stone, donning it before venturing deeper into the market.

He first wandered through the marketplace. The central district was dominated by Fengyue Sect's own establishments, while the outer areas were leased to other merchants at steep rents. These shops had their own supply chains and rarely purchased talismans—and when they did, the prices were heavily discounted.

After inquiring at several shops, Qi Chuan decided to set up his own stall for better profits.

The marketplace featured four plaza-like areas dedicated to stalls, each requiring rental fees.

---

At the northern plaza's entrance, Qi Chuan paid one low-grade spirit stone for a stall—valid for one hour, after which another payment would be due. Though seemingly cheap, the collective revenue from all stalls across the four plazas was substantial.

Locating his stall in a decent mid-section spot, Qi Chuan laid out a brocade cloth and placed a wooden sign: "Mid-Grade First-Tier Five-Element Talismans—4 low-grade spirit stones each. Buy three, get one low-grade Five-Element Talisman free."

Stacks of Fireball Talismans and other mid-grade talismans adorned the cloth, with a single high-grade Fireball Talisman prominently displayed at the front as a centerpiece. Near his side, he arranged previously crafted low-grade Five-Element Talismans.

With everything set, Qi Chuan settled in to wait.

"Damn lightning-struck fool! Another competitor!" Across from him, a burly, fierce-looking middle-aged cultivator at the fifth layer of Qi Refining glared venomously, his temper flaring.

Once the patriarch of a declining cultivation clan, he had inherited leadership after their seventh-layer elder passed away. As a mid-grade first-tier Talisman Master and fifth-layer cultivator, he had no choice but to personally hawk his wares—his clan's next strongest member was only at the third-layer peak.

Yet the White Moon Market's talisman trade was fiercely competitive. Several stalls in the northern plaza alone vied for customers, and his mediocre mid-grade talismans struggled to attract buyers. The arrival of yet another stall directly opposite him nearly made his nostrils flare with rage.

Then his eyes caught the high-grade Fireball Talisman displayed at Qi Chuan's stall. 

"Th-that's... a high-grade talisman? Never mind then..." The talisman's style matched the others, clearly crafted by the same hand—meaning the stall owner was either a high-grade Talisman Master himself or represented one.

Either way, he was outmatched. 

"The patriarch shall retreat while he can." Calculating that his rental time was nearly up, the middle-aged man swiftly packed his stall and departed, unwilling to waste further time and spirit stones against superior competition.
