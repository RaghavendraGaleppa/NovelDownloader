# Chapter 550: The True Disciple’s Conduct

His thoughts raced. For someone of Li Wei’s status to deliberately stage an "accidental" encounter meant he had an ulterior motive.

No Foundation Establishment True Disciple acted without purpose.

Setting aside other sects, within the profit-driven Primordial Sect, a Foundation Establishment True Disciple wouldn't just eagerly rush over for a chance meeting.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, Li Wei shifted the topic, his eyes适时流露出 a mixture of distress and admiration.

He cupped his fists.

"Peak Master Xu, to be frank, this senior brother has come with a thick face today because I have a matter to ask for your help."

"Oh? Feel free to speak, Senior Brother. Within my capabilities, I will certainly do my best."

Xu Yunfan’s smile was warm, but he had already made a guess in his heart.

Li Wei’s smile faded, and he said solemnly, "This matter concerns the peace of the Eastern Wasteland and is also a crucial task personally entrusted by my master, Universal Salvation True Lord."

"Recently, the True Lord captured several ferocious demons that have been lurking for many years on the Eastern Wasteland border, possessing considerable cultivation."

"They are cunning in nature and their origins are sinister. Ordinary sealing techniques likely cannot suppress their demonic thoughts from seeping through and eroding the seal for long. Once they break free or their demonic energy leaks, the consequences would be endless disaster."

"Thus, the True Lord ordered me to be responsible for completely suppressing and refining them."

Xu Yunfan’s mouth twitched slightly; it was the first time he had heard such an absurd joke.

Realizing that his words might seem biased and not in line with the Primordial Sect’s style, Li Wei coughed dryly twice and said, "These demons serve as excellent blood sacrifices; many parts of their bodies are quite valuable."

Xu Yunfan understood.

Li Wei paused, looking at Xu Yunfan.

"I searched high and low for master artisans within and outside the sect, but it is truly difficult to find a reliable person capable of forging a pure artifact that can suppress the true spirits of these fierce demons and isolate their demonic filth."

"After much thought, regarding the purity and stability of the Dao of Artifact Refining, the one who stands alone in the Cold Crow Pass and deeply grasps the true meaning of ancient methods, Peak Master Xu, is undoubtedly the foremost!"

"The reputation of the 'Hundred Refinements Divine Artisan' of Cold Crow Pass is still a beautiful topic of conversation among us fellow disciples even now."

This speech not only pointed out the importance but also elevated the target, while bringing up Xu Yunfan’s past glorious history, praising him无形之中.

Back in the Cold Crow Pass, Xu Yunfan had looted everywhere and was quite skilled in artifact refining, earning the admiration of many.

A flicker of surprise passed through Xu Yunfan’s eyes.

His experience in artifact refining at Cold Crow Pass was from many years ago.

He didn't expect anyone to still remember it.

The True Lord refining Eastern Wasteland demons requires a pagoda capable of suppressing true spirits and isolating demonic filth...

In his mind, the bait behind Liu Yunhua’s "Sinking Star Sword" and the possible layouts of Heavenly Derivation True Lord flashed past instantly.

But the smile on his face grew wider, carrying a hint of interest: "Senior Brother Li overpraises me. It is merely some insignificant skill. What exactly does Senior Brother need to forge? As long as I know the forging method, I certainly dare not refuse."

"Good!"

Li Wei clapped his hands and laughed, "Junior Brother Xu speaks frankly and directly. I need to forge a 'Nine Nether Suppression Prison Pagoda'."

"This pagoda needs to contain pure orthodox Dao suppression demonic runes, based on pure yang purple gold or earth essence, layered with space prohibitions. The core requires drawing upon the clear qi of the nine heavens to temper the true spirit imprint runes, in order to form a power domain that isolates the inside and outside and suppresses the demonic source."

"Nine Nether Suppression Prison Pagoda?"

Xu Yunfan thought to himself, this technique name sounded grand and majestic, but he truly had not mastered the forging method.

He pretended to be deep in thought: "This technique is indeed profound, requiring the superposition of extremely strong space prohibitions and yang and positive energy runes. To be honest, Senior Brother, I am quite unfamiliar with the forging methods of such specialized suppression-type artifacts. The forging method is..."

"Ha ha, Peak Master Xu need not worry."

Li Wei was显然 well-prepared, his smile unchanged. He took out a grey jade talisman from his sleeve, which emitted a warm and ancient aura and was engraved with the outline of a pagoda, and handed it over.

"This item was bestowed by my master. It contains the detailed forging atlas of the 'Nine Nether Suppression Prison Pagoda', the required spiritual materials, the method of arranging rune prohibitions, and the core true spirit imprint secret technique."

"However, this item is closely related to the artifact spirit of the pagoda and is extremely critical. It is inconvenient to copy or duplicate. I can only invite Junior Brother Xu to personally visit my ground-fire spiritual vein cave residence to consult it on the spot for the forging. I have already prepared all the necessary spiritual materials!"

His words were sincere, placing the key items and conditions in the open, appearing full of诚意.

Xu Yunfan took the grey jade talisman. It was slightly heavy in his hand. A pure, thick, and grand will that faintly carried the style of a fusion of Buddhism and Daoism transmitted through the talisman. It was indeed the work of a True Lord. With a slight exploration of his divine sense, he understood that this was the correct forging method.

Not bad. Having obtained a new artifact forging method, Xu Yunfan’s mood became pleasant.

He put away the talisman after a moment of sensing and said readily: "Since there is a forging atlas and spiritual materials, such matters of eliminating demons and protecting the Dao... Ahem... Junior Brother I am duty-bound. Rest assured, Senior Brother Li. Once I return to my peak to make some preparations, I will visit your cave residence and focus on forging this pagoda."

Although he said this, Xu Yunfan was calculating in his heart. Forging this pagoda would undoubtedly be an excellent exercise for condensing Cloud Talisman Runes from the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi of the Profound Capital and deepening his understanding of space.

Forging an unfamiliar artifact, once successful, should yield a lot of proficiency.

Li Wei was overjoyed: "That would be great! I will have to trouble you then, Junior Brother Xu. I will be waiting for the Peak Master’s arrival at the 'Heavenly Furnace Peak'!"

The two exchanged a few more pleasantries before Li Wei turned and disappeared into the shadows of the stacked bookshelves, his figure vanishing in an instant.

The smile on Xu Yunfan’s face faded after Li Wei’s figure disappeared. A purple-gold color flowed through the depths of his eyes as he pondered deeply.

Universal Salvation True Lord was the strongest late-stage Golden Core True Lord in the Primordial Sect.

His forces were naturally dominant.

But the Primordial Sect had many others skilled in artifact refining. Why come to him to forge it?

Could it be...

Xu Yunfan’s eyes deepened, his thoughts racing. He wasn't afraid. Within the Primordial Sect, a True Lord would need to find a reason to make a move.

He put the secret technique jade slip obtained from the Scripture Pavilion into his芥子空间 (Spat) and turned to walk out of the Scripture Pavilion.

The huge stone doors of the Scripture Pavilion closed silently again, isolating the mysterious and profound aura within.

The afternoon sun shone somewhat dazzlingly on the cold black stone tiles of the plaza in front of the entrance.

Just as he walked down the long steps of the Scripture Pavilion, which seemed to be built from countless vertebrae, a figure, carrying determination and uncontrollable anger, like a cornered cub, suddenly rushed in front of Xu Yunfan, blocking his path.

Xu Yunfan stopped, his expression cold, looking down at the figure below as if looking at an ant.

It was a thin youth, his face still carrying childishness, wearing the grey-green Dao robe of an ordinary inner disciple.

By its style, it should be a disciple of the Hundred Desires Peak.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly, but he didn't speak.

The youth bit his lower lip hard, so hard that it bled. His face was flushed red from excitement and fear, and his fists clenched at his sides, trembling slightly.

After all, blocking a Foundation Establishment True Disciple alone, not being slapped to death on the spot was a victory.

His cultivation...

Hmm.

Xu Yunfan swept a glance. His Dantian Qi Sea was thin, his meridians shallow and narrow, his True Yuan fluctuations impetuous, and his foundation unstable.
