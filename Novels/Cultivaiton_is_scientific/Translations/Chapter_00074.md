# Chapter 74 Guidance

Li Shiming and nine other youths entered the Qingqiu Pavilion, where a young cultivator awaited them.

"Greetings, I'm Zhu Ji, your guidance senior brother. Please introduce yourselves first!" said the smiling senior brother named Zhu Ji.

Following Zhu Ji's gesture, the youths introduced themselves one by one, with Li Shiming simply stating his name.

"Guiding you is my task. For the next three months, I'll be here every morning for two hours. During this period, you can ask me any questions—this is a privilege for newcomers. After the three-month initiation period ends, such opportunities will no longer be available. Any questions afterward will require equivalent exchange for answers. I hope you cherish these three months."

"Before taking you to receive your primary cultivation techniques, I'll first explain some fundamental knowledge about cultivators," Zhu Ji's voice clearly reached everyone's ears.

All understood the importance of Zhu Ji's upcoming explanation—it might determine the course of their cultivation careers—and focused intently.

"Cultivators' combat methods are divided into close-range and long-range. Close-range cultivators typically practice body-refining techniques, relying on their own strength, speed, formidable defense, and artifacts to suppress enemies at close quarters."

"Long-range cultivators primarily use long-range artifacts, spells, and talismans as their main means of attack. Most cultivators choose this combat style because maintaining distance allows them to alternate between offense and defense."

"Cultivators can also be categorized by profession into combat and support types. The most famous combat type is the sword cultivator—equally adept at close and long range, with formidable combat prowess, reputed to 'break ten thousand techniques with a single sword.'"

"Support types include alchemists, talisman makers, spirit farmers, etc. These are often secondary professions, as few cultivators abandon combat entirely—survival in the cultivation world requires combat ability."

"What kind of cultivator you wish to become is your choice, and the sect won't interfere."

"Your spiritual roots were tested during the Ascension Assembly, but those conditions pale in comparison to the spiritual root measurement array here in Qingqiu Pavilion. Here, you can clearly see the numerical values of each of your spiritual roots—the most important reference for choosing your primary cultivation technique."

"Do not reveal your spiritual root values to others. This will be your lifelong secret, affecting your cultivation path, the attribute requirements of your artifacts and resources, and even the resources needed for eventual Foundation Establishment." Zhu Ji's piercing gaze swept across the youths.

The youths didn't fully grasp his meaning yet, but understood it must be extremely important given Zhu Ji's emphasis.

"Enter the array ahead one by one. Remember your spiritual root values. After obtaining them, you can decide for yourselves or consult me about technique selection," Zhu Ji said with a wave of his hand once he saw the youths understood.

At the center of Qingqiu Pavilion appeared an array enveloped in white light.

While the other youths hesitated, Li Shiming stepped forward first into the white light.

Upon entering, he felt white light rising from below penetrate his entire body, as if scanning every cell thoroughly.

He suspected this array did more than measure spiritual roots—it likely also screened new disciples.

He worried his Machine Room Space might be detected, but his fears proved unfounded, confirming that the connection between his Machine Room Space and himself couldn't be discovered through ordinary cultivation means.

"Metal Spiritual Root: 81,  
Fire Spiritual Root: 11,  
Wood Spiritual Root: 8."

The array conveyed this information, letting him know his spiritual root values.

Bewildered, he exited the measurement array. Had Zhu Ji not emphasized secrecy, he would have asked for an explanation immediately.

After Li Shiming exited, the other youths entered one by one.

"You've all memorized your spiritual root values. The total is always 100. If you had a single spiritual root, that root's value would be 100. None of you are single-root geniuses—not even dual-root ones."

"So pay attention—your highest value root is your primary spiritual root. When choosing techniques, select ones that align with your primary root."

"If two roots have similarly high values, choose a technique compatible with both—like the 'Firewood Art' for wood-fire roots or 'Earthfire Art' for fire-earth roots."

"If three roots have similar values, follow your intuition," Zhu Ji said intently, watching the ten youths.

"Senior Brother Zhu Ji, does higher spiritual root value mean greater strength?" one youth asked.

All eyes turned to Zhu Ji, clearly interested in this question.

"Spiritual root values aren't as crucial as you might think. Compatibility between roots can sometimes matter more than individual values," Zhu Ji replied after consideration.

However, Li Shiming noticed Zhu Ji's microexpression—a telltale sign of insincerity.

---

Zhu Ji likely truly believed spiritual root values were important but didn't want to discourage some newcomers.

He felt helpless—originally, there had been three dual-root talents, but all had perished.

Had dual-rooted youths been present, at least the Eight Peaks would have sent deacon-level elders. But knowing only ten newcomers with three-to-four roots remained—all severely traumatized—the Eight Peaks had lost interest.

Probably only after three months would representatives come to evaluate them.

"Come forward one by one to receive your items," Zhu Ji changed the subject.

He called names, and youths stepped forward to receive a robe with the Tianhai Sect's emblem and a jade token.

Li Shiming was called last. As he approached, Zhu Ji said:

"Li Shiming, you've already reached Qi Refinement third layer, but you'll still reside in Qingqiu Pavilion these three months. Its spiritual energy is the richest among the Nine Peaks—opportunities to cultivate here after the initiation period are rare."

"This storage pouch contains your identity jade slip, Tianhai robe, a paper crane, and a standard low-grade sword artifact," Zhu Ji said with a smile.

The other youths looked at their robes and identity slips, exchanging glances. Having survived life-and-death situations, few dared voice complaints about the disparity.

"When you reach Qi Refinement first layer, you'll receive storage pouches and paper cranes too. At second layer, the sect will issue standard low-grade sword artifacts," Zhu Ji explained solemnly.
