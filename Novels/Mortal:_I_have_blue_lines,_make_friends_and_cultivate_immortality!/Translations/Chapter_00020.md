# Chapter 20: Born With Alluring Physique, Male?!

"Dong Xuan'er, why is this woman following us?" Lin Yun looked curiously at the pink-robed female cultivator trailing behind them.

"Brother Lin, I'm Dong Xuan'er. Can we be friends?" Dong Xuan'er boldly extended her delicate hand toward Lin Yun.

[Ding, Dong Xuan'er has sent you a friend request. Will you accept?]

[Accept!]

[Ding, congratulations host for successfully adding friend Dong Xuan'er. Current favorability (40 - Intrigued)]

[Host can draw one reward from Dong Xuan'er. Draw now?]

[Draw.]

[Ding, drawing in progress...]

[Ding, congratulations host for obtaining talent trait: Born With Alluring Physique.]

"Huh?!" Lin Yun's expression resembled a confused cow cat. "Can men have this physique too?!" He was utterly shocked.

[Item Description: Born With Alluring Physique - The host possesses irresistible charm and grace. Any member of the opposite sex who sees the host will instinctively feel favorable toward them. The closer the proximity, the stronger the physical attraction becomes.]

"Holy—" After reading the system's description, Lin Yun nearly shouted internally, finding it both amusing and exasperating. "Doesn't that make me a walking aphrodisiac?!"

As soon as Lin Yun finished this thought, Dong Xuan'er, for some inexplicable reason, suddenly felt an odd yet fascinating aura emanating from him—as if she had encountered a kindred spirit. Even the usually bold Dong Xuan'er couldn't help but feel a hint of shyness.

At the same time, Lin Yun also sensed a strange stirring in his heart. He glanced back at Dong Xuan'er.

"Seriously? Does this 'Born With Alluring Physique' also create mutual attraction?!"

Fortunately, Lin Yun had strong self-control and could suppress these urges by focusing his mind.

[Ding, Dong Xuan'er's favorability has increased by 20, reaching 60 (Love at First Sight!)]

[Host can draw another reward from Dong Xuan'er.]

[Ding, congratulations host for obtaining top-tier supreme artifact: Spring Transformation Fan.]

[Item Description: Spring Transformation Fan - A top-tier supreme artifact with flight capabilities, wind-based attacks, and illusion-enhancing effects. Note: Works best when paired with Born With Alluring Physique.]

"..." Lin Yun's face darkened. "I do need a top-tier offensive artifact, but does it have to be this one?!"

But upon further thought, it made sense. What else could he expect from Dong Xuan'er? She wasn't a treasure trove like Han Li. Still, she was worth cultivating. After all, by the time Han Li returned from the Chaotic Star Sea, she had already reached Core Formation stage and enjoyed the protection of the Clouddew Demon. Whether she could reach Nascent Soul was uncertain, but at the very least, she would be at late Core Formation.

---

Watching the bashful Dong Xuan'er trailing behind them, Han Li could barely suppress his envy and bitterness.

Why were people so different?!

He, Han Li, might not be as dashing, talented, or socially adept as Brother Lin, but he had the Mysterious Small Bottle!

"Calm down, Han Li! The secret of the Small Bottle must never be revealed!" Han Li repeatedly reassured himself, gradually regaining his composure.

"Brother Lin, I never expected you to escape danger again. That was too close! I think we should be more cautious and low-key from now on." Han Li shuddered at the memory of what had happened in the Tai Nan Mountain Tower.

"Haha—Don't worry, Brother Han. Making friends is my specialty—it always helps me out of trouble!" Lin Yun laughed carelessly.

Han Li shook his head. It wasn't that he disapproved of Lin Yun's methods, but such an approach simply didn’t suit him.

"Brother Lin, which sect do you plan to join?" Han Li asked curiously.

Hearing this, Dong Xuan'er immediately interjected, "Brother Lin should obviously join our Yellow Maple Valley!"

She blinked her large, captivating eyes at Lin Yun. "Brother Lin, please join Yellow Maple Valley, okay? If you don’t, how will I bear missing you? If you join, I’ll protect you! My master is none other than Elder Hong Fu, the top Core Formation expert in Yellow Maple Valley!"

Her incessant chattering along the way made Han Li increasingly irritated. "How many times does she have to mention that her master is Elder Hong Fu, the top Core Formation expert? And she’s just a Qi Condensation cultivator—how can she be so sure this Elder Hong Fu will take her as a disciple?"

"Miss Dong, how can you be certain this Elder Hong Fu will accept you as her disciple?" Han Li retorted.

"None of your business! She will!" Dong Xuan'er snapped back, her tone far less sweet than when she spoke to Lin Yun.

"It's all because of this dark-skinned guy that Brother Lin barely talks to me!" Dong Xuan'er fumed inwardly. She even began to wonder if Lin Yun had some peculiar preferences, ignoring a beauty like her while chatting enthusiastically with Han Li.

---

"You—" Han Li choked on his own saliva, coughing a few times before lecturing, "Miss Dong, even if this Elder Hong Fu takes you as her disciple, she won’t be able to protect you all the time! In the world of cultivation, the most important thing is self-reliance! Only your own strength is real strength!"

Dong Xuan'er placed her hands on her hips and shot back, "You’re just jealous! Jealous that I have such a great master while you’re just a mediocre mixed-spiritual-root rogue cultivator with no talent in cultivation or crafting! And worst of all—you’re not even handsome! Nothing like Brother Lin!"

"Brother Lin has sharp brows and starry eyes, and despite being a five-spiritual-root cultivator, he’s already at the eleventh level of Qi Condensation! He’s also a once-in-a-generation talisman-making genius! Unlike you—utterly ordinary."

After her tirade, she grabbed Lin Yun’s hand. "Brother Lin, am I right?!"

"Enough!" Lin Yun shook her off, his expression stern. "Brother Han and I are kindred spirits. How dare you insult him like this?! Brother Han is blessed with great fortune and an unshakable Dao heart. His name will one day shake the entire human realm! If you continue judging people with such shallow standards, you might as well leave!"

"Wow—even angry, Brother Lin is so handsome!" Instead of being upset, Dong Xuan'er only grew more infatuated.

[Ding, Dong Xuan'er's favorability increased by 5. Current favorability (65).]

"Huh? Is this girl... not right in the head?" Lin Yun felt like he had stumbled upon something bizarre.

Meanwhile, Han Li was deeply moved by Lin Yun’s words. He hadn’t realized he held such importance in Lin Yun’s heart!

"Brother Lin truly is the best!"

[Ding, Han Li’s favorability increased by 10. Current favorability (70 - Close Friendship).]

That night, Han Li sought out Lin Yun.

"Brother Han, what’s the matter?" Noticing his hesitation, Lin Yun took the initiative to ask.

"Brother Lin, I still have some pills. Could I trade them for a high-grade defensive artifact?" Han Li handed over three bottles of Golden Marrow Pills.

"Brother Lin, please don’t think I’m being overly cautious or hiding things from you. It’s just that in this world, one must always be careful." Han Li explained the origin of the pills to avoid suspicion, especially since he had previously claimed to have run out.

After nearly being ambushed by Lu Yunfeng earlier, Han Li realized he couldn’t afford to be without a defensive artifact. If Lu Yunfeng had truly targeted him, he wouldn’t have stood a chance. Hence, he came to Lin Yun for help.

"Hahaha—Brother Han, no need to explain. As a rogue cultivator myself, I understand the necessity of keeping secrets. It’s the only way to survive." Lin Yun waved his hand, summoning a miniature yellow shield that floated before Han Li.

"Brother Han, since we’re kindred spirits, I’ll give you this Earth Essence Shield!"

"No, no, no! Absolutely not! Brother Lin, this is a top-tier artifact—far too precious. My pills aren’t worth this!" Han Li adamantly refused.

Seeing his determination, Lin Yun relented and instead gave Han Li a high-grade chainmail armor he had obtained from Huang Xiaotian—a case of turning trash into treasure.

As for the pills, Lin Yun declined, claiming they were no longer useful to him. Accepting them would have prevented him from triggering the "Repay Kindness with Greater Kindness" effect.

Han Li didn’t press further, knowing the pills were indeed of little use to Lin Yun now. He promised to repay him with spirit stones in the future.

[Ding, host has gifted Han Li a high-grade defensive artifact: Chainmail Armor, triggering "Repay Kindness with Greater Kindness."]

[Ding, congratulations host for obtaining: Top-tier supreme defensive artifact: True Wood Shield.]

[Item Description: Possesses extremely high defensive capabilities. Originally from the storage pouch of an unknown cultivator slain by Han Li.]

Overjoyed with his new artifact, Han Li spent the next few days refining the chainmail in his room.

As the Tai Nan Gathering concluded, cultivators began traveling in groups to the Heavenly Mist Platform for the Ascension Assembly. Along the way, they discussed the recent events at Tai Nan Mountain Tower, particularly Lin Yun’s exploits—much to the envy of all rogue cultivators.

Meanwhile, at the Chen Family residence in Yellow Maple Valley, Sect Leader Zhong Lingdao rushed over after receiving a message from Elder Li Huayuan, urgently seeking the current family head—Chen Qiaoqian’s father.
