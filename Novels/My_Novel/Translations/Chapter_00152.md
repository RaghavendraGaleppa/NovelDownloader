Chapter 152: The Mistress's Ban on Marriage, The New County Magistrate

The Spring Drunken Pavilion.

Lin Guolong, the County Magistrate of Qingning County, hosted a promotion banquet. In the outer hall, he entertained representatives from various sects and schools, aristocratic families, wealthy merchants, and numerous yamen runners.

In the inner hall, a smaller table was set for Li Xian and the family members.

"Brother Li, drink."

The beautiful concubine held a silver pot, pouring wine and serving dishes with meticulous care. Her delicate eyes swept over Li Xian from time to time.

Ripples stirred in her heart. The Martial Commander of Qingning County was indeed as handsome and extraordinary as the rumors claimed.

"My thanks."

Li Xian maintained perfect etiquette, raising his cup to offer congratulations. "Brother Lin, congratulations on your promotion!"

"Hahaha, the joy is shared, the joy is shared." Lin Guolong clinked cups and drained his drink in one go, full of high spirits.

It turned out...

Ever since the Yellow Dragon Army was completely wiped out and tens of thousands of prisoners were incorporated into the provincial army, Lin Guolong had been rewarded according to his merits, allowing him to advance one rank.

Over the past while, the court had been considering the arrangement of official positions. Just two days ago, the order came down: he was promoted to be the County Magistrate of "Shenglin Prefecture" and "Luo Porcelain County."

Although both were counties, Shenglin Prefecture was far wealthier than the poor Tianfu County, and Luo Porcelain County governed eight hundred miles of land, with a thriving porcelain industry and unimpeded water transport.

It was simply incomparable to Qingning County.

Although it was a transfer of the same rank, it was practically a promotion. Lin Guolong's days would be even more comfortable; he might even need to add a few more concubines.

"By the way, Brother Li, although I am leaving, the position of Qingning County Magistrate will still be held by my Lin family," Lin Guolong said with a smile. "At that time, I hope Brother Li will offer a little help."

"Qingning County is flourishing. The new County Magistrate will surely be satisfied," Li Xian said casually, making no promises.

"It's a pity, such a pity," Lin Guolong said. "It's a pity that such a large courtyard, I can't take it away. These... why don't I give them to Brother Li?"

"These servant girls and slaves will obey your commands from now on. And these beautiful concubines of mine, if you take a liking to any of them, I can give her to you."

"They've been clamoring to serve you closely for a long time."

Lin Guolong had refined tastes and would never mistreat himself. Although these concubines were married women, they were still quite charming. Years of living in comfort and taking good care of themselves had left their skin fair and delicate; they were all beauties of their region.

Although he said this in jest, if Li Xian spoke the word, he would not hesitate at all. Women could be found again; it was best to make friends with such a young prodigy as soon as possible.

Ultimately, the credit for this promotion was brought by Li Xian.

He was indeed broad-minded and generous.

The group of beautiful concubines hid their anticipation, not feeling the slightest bit of shame or annoyance. Their eyes scanned him up and down; this Martial Commander was heroic and brave, handsome and elegant. His performance in bed must surely be excellent. If they could truly have a passionate battle in bed with him and experience the joy therein, it would not be a waste to have walked this world.

Li Xian smiled. "I have no objection to accepting the mansion. After all, with Brother Lin gone, no one would manage it anyway. But as for the affection of these beauties, let's forget it."

"Is it because the Mistress won't allow it?" Lin Guolong asked teasingly.

"Ahem." Li Xian took a sip of wine and did not answer. The Mistress's thoughts were hard to guess, but she indeed forbade his romantic desires and did not allow him to marry others.

To be honest, this was a bit embarrassing. As a great man, Li Xian was naturally very displeased to be restrained like this, hoping that one day he could turn the tables. But for now, he still had to submit to the Mistress's dominance.

"Alas, you all lack the fortune. You will have to continue following me in the future," Lin Guolong said with a laugh. The concubines were greatly disappointed but dared not say more.

"By the way, where is your wife?" Li Xian changed the subject.

"Her?" Lin Guolong said. "A divine dragon is rarely seen; who knows where she has gone."

"Come, come, come, let's drink well together. Once I leave, who knows when we will meet again."

The next day. Lin Guolong, accompanied by his wife, concubines, slaves, and guards, set off for Luo Porcelain County to take up his post. The procession was grand, with firecrackers and gongs all along the way, as if afraid that others wouldn't know he had been promoted.

With no leader in Qingning County, Li Xian, as the Martial Commander, was the undisputed number one.

In the county, Li Xian's word was weighty and carried immense authority.

Every day, there were countless people knocking on his doorstep, hoping to give gifts and curry favor. If one could establish even a slight connection with the Martial Commander, who would dare bully them in Qingning County?

However, Li Xian was weary of dealing with them. He simply refused all guests and focused on his martial arts practice.

Although receiving external gifts was a considerable source of income—even more profitable than the clothing business—it brought endless trouble, with various debts of favors and trivial matters缠身.

It was better to earn money from the clothing business, which was stable and convenient. Therefore, in his spare time from martial arts practice, Li Xian would pay attention to the clothing business.

He had expanded several stores.

The income was substantial.

[Proficiency +3]

[Setting Sun Fading Blood Sword]

[Proficiency: 9199/12000 Great Achievement]

[Copper-Iron Body]

[Proficiency: 2689/3000 Great Achievement]

Li Xian practiced diligently day and night. Heaven rewards the diligent, and his martial arts prowess improved daily.

On this day, his Qi gathered in his Dantian. The Qi Lake surged, accumulating into an abyss, and hundreds of rivers finally merged into a sea. He had finally accumulated a Qi Lake of fifteen zhang* (a traditional unit of length, roughly 3.3 meters). The quantitative change triggered a qualitative change.

*(Note: 15 zhang is approximately 50 meters, implying a vast internal energy reservoir.)*

The Qi Lake churned, and mist rose, creating a strange and wonderful scene. Li Xian felt a clear energy rushing to the heavens, his entire body light and buoyant, as if bathing in clouds.

Not long after.

The mist in the Qi Lake receded, replaced by a suspension of five-colored flowing light.

A martial artist's internal Qi cannot normally be sustained outside the body for long. Once it leaves the body, it quickly dissipates. However, after the qualitative change of the Qi Lake, the quality of the internal Qi reached a new level, harmonizing with the myriad things of heaven and earth.

It possessed more profound mysteries.

Because strictly speaking, internal Qi originates from martial arts, and martial arts originate from heaven and earth. The accumulation of the Qi Lake to a certain extent precisely indicates that the martial artist, through practicing martial arts and comprehending heaven and earth, has also achieved a small degree of understanding.

This, in turn, allows the internal Qi to persist in the world for a longer time.

Li Xian struck a palm strike into the air, channeling a sufficient amount of internal Qi.

In the past, once his internal Qi left his body by one zhang, it would inevitably disperse. Even the most exquisite Qi manipulation techniques could not reverse this trend.

Today, his palm force reached even two zhang!

The difference was like... a scholar who once closed his door to visitors, burying himself in books. Because he was not good at speaking and was introverted, he couldn't travel far. When he went out, he would be flustered by various situations.

Now, he has become an outgoing and knowledgeable scholar, adept at conversing with others and speaking eloquently. He has dabbled in all sorts of fields. He is more adapted to the external environment, entering and exiting freely.

That is why he can go further.

If he takes another step forward in the future, he might not only be glib-tongued but also be able to charm some beauties and bring back treasures.

"My strength has increased again. Good... I will accumulate bit by bit like this! Progress bit by bit!"

"The Mistress said that the next qualitative change of the Qi Lake will be at thirty-two zhang. I still need to work hard! Strive for further progress!"

"At this moment, the blood and energy in my body are fully mobilized. This is the best time to consume the Essence Treasure!" Li Xian felt his internal Qi was abundant, his strength powerful, and his energy vigorous.

He opened the Sky-Containing Box and cut off a gram of essence meat.

He consumed the Essence Treasure, digesting the essence of heaven and earth.

The physiques of martial artists are different, and the speed at which they digest the essence of heaven and earth varies. When Li Xian first entered the Food Essence stage, one gram of essence meat could generate fifteen strands of heaven and earth essence.

After reinforcement, it became over twenty strands.

Usually, he would retain three strands, and if luck was good, it would be four or five strands.

However, these few strands of heaven and earth essence required two or three days to digest. Engaging in combat, comprehending heaven and earth, and practicing martial arts could increase the digestion speed.

Li Xian had the Mistress's supply, so the [Essence Treasure] was not in short supply for the time being. The Mistress would only refine a cauldron once every half a month or so. It wasn't that the essence meat was insufficient, but rather that digestion took time. Refining too frequently was truly a waste!

With dedicated cultivation, his progress increased again.

[You have accumulated the digestion of six strands of heaven and earth essence, Food Essence stage proficiency +1]

[Proficiency: 3/100]

On the third day after Lin Guolong's departure.

The new County Magistrate arrived. Carried by eight people, with hundreds of servants and dozens of guards. The momentum was formidable.

Cao Yun lifted the carriage curtain and saw the city gate of "Qingning County." He frowned: "This is Qingning County? It's too poor."

He jumped out of the sedan chair and straightened his clothes. Golden bracelets, jade belts, brocade robes and leather boots—he was extraordinarily wealthy.

Looking at his appearance... he was forty-six years old, not young. Thick eyebrows, a large nose, big ears, but thin lips.

He strolled towards the city.

"Why is there no one to greet me? I, the County Magistrate, have arrived, and there is no one to guide me. What kind of situation is this?" Cao Yun frowned as he saw no one at the city gate.

"We probably arrived too quickly, and the people in the county don't know yet," said the guard beside Cao Yun.

"Then notify them!" Cao Yun said displeasedly. "This is truly outrageous. Even though I didn't notify in advance, anyone with a bit of sense should know that I, the County Magistrate, will definitely take office within a few days. Shouldn't they have prepared in advance to welcome me, just in case?"

"With such a disordered county order, could they really have resisted the Yellow Dragon Army?"

Hearing this, the guard immediately ran into the city. His steps were light and swift, possessing quite impressive lightness skill.

The officials of the county yamen, upon hearing that the County Magistrate had arrived, came to greet him one after another. Their attitude was sincere, but Cao Yun spoke in a sarcastic tone, criticizing them in every other sentence.

He refused to let up.

Until the guard reminded him: "Master, we have just arrived in Qingning and need to use people. It's best to restrain yourself a little."

Only then did Cao Yun stop.

Amidst the crowd of followers, Cao Yun went to the main hall of the yamen. People gathered along the way to watch, and the local powers and tyrants of Qingning County also sent people to investigate.

The county was bustling.

"County Lieutenant Zhang, I heard that there is a certain Martial Commander in our county? Is this true or false?" Cao Yun asked casually.

"It is true."

The County Lieutenant of Qingning County was surnamed Zhang, named Yiheng.

"Have him come to see me," Cao Yun said offhandedly.

"He... he..." Zhang Yiheng glanced at the receiving officials, his expression strange. "He is not here."

"Not here? Then where is he?" Cao Yun stopped walking, frowned, and straightened his hat. "I, the County Magistrate, am taking office today. I am his superior. He doesn't even show his face. Does he look down on me?!"

"No... that shouldn't be," Zhang Yiheng wiped a handful of sweat. "Perhaps this Martial Commander is too absorbed in his martial arts practice. I will send someone to call him right away."

"Hmph!" Cao Yun said. "From here to the yamen hall, it's still two miles. By the time I arrive at the hall, if he hasn't appeared before me, then he shouldn't bother coming!"

"Even if he comes, this official will not see him!"

With a flick of his sleeve, he strode away.

Zhang Yiheng glanced at the trusted aide beside him.

The aide, being a constable, was swift of foot. He hurried to notify Li Xian. He went to the Martial Commander's Hall, only to find that Li Xian was not there.

The constable immediately returned to report. Upon receiving the news, Zhang Yiheng said with difficulty, "County Magistrate Cao... I'm afraid Commander Li can't... can't come."

Cao Yun narrowed his eyes. "Oh? Can't come?"

"He, he is not in the Martial Commander's Hall at the moment," Zhang Yiheng said.

"So that's how it is..." Cao Yun laughed. "What a fine Martial Commander. On my very first day in office, he dares to give me a下馬威 (a show of disrespect)."

"County Magistrate, you have misunderstood," Zhang Yiheng hurriedly said. "Commander Li probably doesn't mean that. You also know that the Martial Commander deals with matters of the Jianghu and often has to travel."

"It's perfectly normal for him not to be in the hall."

Cao Yun said, "Are you defending him?"

"I wouldn't dare," Zhang Yiheng shook his head quickly.

"Enough," Cao Yun said coldly. "This official has been an official for twenty years. I've seen all kinds of people. I've seen too many little men who, upon gaining a bit of power, forget themselves."

"Today, in front of everyone, he has given me a下馬威. Everyone has seen it."

He strode into the yamen hall.

With a wave of his hand, all the items in the hall were moved outside.

"These things are too old. Since I have taken office, there should be a new atmosphere. Change them, change them, change them all."

Cao Yun pointed at the old items in the yamen, criticizing the person through the object.

Zhang Yiheng understood. This County Magistrate... was here to cause trouble!
