# Chapter 454: Taking Control of Coldcrow Pass

The moment Xu Yunfan stepped into the main hall, more than ten guarding cultivators in the hall bowed in unison.

He swept his gaze across the hall. These were the guarding cultivators of Coldcrow Pass, all looking at this new Garrison Commander with slightly tense expressions.

The bluish stone floor reflected the pale moonlight, casting the elongated shadows of everyone onto the mottled walls in distorted shapes.

The Qi Condensation disciples in the front row didn't even dare to look directly at this Foundation Establishment True Lord. Their necks were bent so low they seemed about to break, and the backs of their cyan Dao robes were already soaked with cold sweat.

"Rise."

Xu Yunfan raised his hand slightly, his gaze sweeping over the young cultivator trembling in the corner.

Facing a Foundation Establishment True Lord for the first time, especially within the Primordial Origin Sect, and especially amidst such a transition of power between the old and new, it wouldn't be strange if one or two people died to demonstrate the True Lord's might.

The hall was filled with the smell of low-quality calming incense, mixed with the stench of old blood, making one's temples throb.

Xu Yunfan frowned slightly, remaining silent. A heavy sense of oppression spread through the hall like a tangible thing.

Although the spiritual pressure of a Foundation Establishment True Lord wasn't deliberately released, it already made the Qi Condensation cultivators present feel as if they were sitting on pins and needles. They had to be extremely careful even with their breathing.

In the corner, a young cultivator had fine beads of sweat seeping from his forehead. His Adam's apple bobbed, but he didn't even dare to make a sound when swallowing.

He stared fixedly at the ground, as if the patterns on the bluestone bricks could save his life. The fellow disciple beside him had an even paler face, his fingers unconsciously digging into his palm, completely unaware of the pain.

The gray-bearded Zhou Lu in the front row had his forehead pressed against the cold floor tiles, his beard trembling slightly.

The silence of a Foundation Establishment True Lord was more frightening than any scolding. He only felt his chest tighten, as if a huge stone was pressing on his heart, making even his heartbeat feel sluggish.

The hall was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Only the smoke from the low-quality calming incense curled upwards, twisting into strange shapes under the sunlight from outside.

Everyone's gaze was lowered, not daring to meet Xu Yunfan's eyes, for fear that a single carelessness would make them a sacrifice to establish the new official's authority.

The air seemed to freeze, and even the wind from the River of Netherworld seemed to be cut off.

Only when the sound of Xu Yunfan's finger gently tapping on the jade slip rang out did everyone breathe a sigh of relief like they had been pardoned. However, they immediately tensed up again, waiting for the next word from this new Garrison Commander.

Xu Yunfan naturally paid no mind to the unease in the hearts of the cultivators in the hall.

Disciples of the Demonic Sect, especially those of a lower position facing a higher one, being cautious and meticulous was the way to survive.

It wasn't strange for them to be like this. If there had been one who stood tall and looked him in the eye, he would certainly have given that person a few extra glances.

If there was something wrong, he would naturally want to see where that person's confidence came from, and there might even be an unexpected surprise.

On the table lay a jade slip emitting a faint green light, its edges radiating a certain warmth, clearly having been imprinted just recently.

When Xu Yunfan finished reading the jade slip, his expression was indescribable. The gray-robed old man kneeling at the very front suddenly shuffled forward on his knees two steps. "R-Reporting, True Lord, Commander Li said three days ago he was going to inspect the array core, but the result... the result..."

His Adam's apple bobbed, and his turbid eyes kept glancing towards the River of Netherworld outside the hall. "When he came back, he only transmitted this recording jade slip..."

"What is your name?" Xu Yunfan interrupted, noticing three dark patterns embroidered on the old man's sleeve. This was the mark of a guarding captain at Coldcrow Pass.

Coldcrow Pass, as the most important border fortress of the Primordial Origin Sect, not only controlled the throat leading to the three states but was also the largest black market distribution center within the Demonic Sect's sphere of influence.

Pills from the Righteous Path, Dharma tools from the Buddhist sect, and secret medicines from the Demonic Sect were all traded here at clear prices, day and night.

The stall taxes collected each month alone were enough to match the offerings of an ordinary sect for half a year.

The profits from this were naturally not to be underestimated.

Besides the portion submitted to the Primordial Origin Sect each year, there was still a considerable surplus, enough for him to eat and drink his fill within it.

That's right, since he had been sent to Coldcrow Pass to be some Garrison Commander, he naturally needed to line his own pockets and make a fortune to be worthy of himself.

That Li Wei was quite decisive. Before leaving, he clearly recorded a ledger in the jade slip. The spirit stones, pills, and Dharma tools in the Coldcrow Pass storeroom had actually been swept away by him for more than seventy percent.

Now, the glaring deficit on the account books was like the floating and sinking severed arms on the River of Netherworld; it was shocking for anyone who saw it.

If he couldn't make up for it, although he wouldn't die, he would still suffer a bit.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan felt a slight shadow over his heart.

These Demonic Sect True Lords were truly a bunch of people who harmed others without benefiting themselves, each and every one a twisted individual.

"Little one... little one is Zhou Lu, at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation..."

The old man suddenly kowtowed heavily, his forehead making a dull sound as it hit the bluestone bricks. "There are currently seventeen guarding cultivators at Coldcrow Pass, of which three are late-stage Qi Condensation, and nine are mid-stage..."

His speech grew faster and faster, as if reciting something he had practiced a thousand times. "The array patterns on the east side watchtower are damaged in three places, the west side..."

"Guardian Zhou." Xu Yunfan tapped the table lightly with the jade slip. The crisp sound made the old man suddenly stop talking. "Tell me about the market first."

He didn't care at all about these watchtowers and array patterns on Coldcrow Pass. They were just for show at the Qi Condensation level. In a conflict at the Foundation Establishment level, these defenses were as good as useless. The only things that could truly determine the survival of Coldcrow Pass were the mountain protection array inherited from the Primordial Origin Sect within the pass, and the disparity in strength between the Foundation Establishment True Lords.

If the forces from the Bodhisattva Pure Land and the Ten Thousand乘 Sword Sect were to really attack, Xu Yunfan would fight if he could. If he couldn't, he would naturally abandon Coldcrow Pass without hesitation and flee.

What Xu Yunfan was most concerned about was naturally the market with the best commission.

He stroked the edge of the jade slip, his spiritual sense sweeping over the eye-catching deficit on the ledger. The market transactions on the new and full moon nights, the taxes from the trade of pills from the Righteous Path and secret medicines from the Demonic Sect, were the key to filling this seventy percent deficit.

To make up for the deficit, the market was the top priority.

A series of gasps immediately sounded in the hall.

A young cultivator with a Dao topknot in the back row had his legs go weak, and he directly slumped to the ground.

Xu Yunfan glanced at him and naturally understood that every single one of these people was a good-for-nothing who was skilled at embezzlement.

But he didn't care. If the people doing the work below didn't eat their fill, how could they work wholeheartedly?

As long as it wasn't excessive, he didn't mind these people picking up some crumbs to eat.

Zhou Lu's Adam's apple rolled violently twice, his gray beard trembling with his rapid breathing. Facing Xu Yunfan's cold eyes, he didn't dare to hide anything.

"Reporting to True Lord, the daily transaction volume of the market is about thirty thousand spirit stones, of which two percent is taken as commission..."

He suddenly stopped talking at the key point, his turbid eyes glancing at the young cultivator who had slumped to the ground.

"Continue." Xu Yunfan tapped the table lightly with the jade slip. The crisp sound startled the young cultivator into a shudder.

He glanced over, and the young cultivator immediately broke out in a cold sweat, too terrified to make a sound.

It seems he's a connection-based hire?

Xu Yunfan thought idly.

"Yes... yes..." Zhou Lu wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. "On the new and full moon days each month, the transaction volume can triple. Just on the fifteenth of last month, the commission from the trade of Dharma tools from the Buddhist Esoteric Sect alone was eight hundred spirit stones..."
