# Chapter 142: Hellish Difficulty

The Godfall Plains, with its fertile soil, could reveal threads of fiery red springs with just a shovel's depth, capable of nurturing all things. Thus, even though this vast plain was covered by dense night fog and plunged into darkness, it boasted lush vegetation and an abundance of species.

"Young master, you're finally back!" When the people of Luojia Village spotted Qin Ming, a large crowd rushed to surround him. Earlier, their hearts had been filled with anxiety; now, they showed faces full of anticipation.

"Don't worry, the wolf problem is solved," Qin Ming assured them.

"Young master, you truly are our great benefactor!" Some people choked up, their eyes red, especially the families who had lost children. Both old and young shed tears. The Newborns in the village were no match for wolf monsters of that caliber. Lately, they had been living in constant tension and fear, every day feeling like a year.

Unable to refuse their warm hospitality, Qin Ming stayed for lunch and took the opportunity to ask the village chief about the Silver Wolf King. He felt uneasy, believing that if this old wolf wasn't eliminated, more incidents would surely occur in the future.

"It lives in the Wolf Den and has over a hundred wolf monsters under its command." Qin Ming pondered, deciding to secretly eliminate it when the time was right. He suspected that this Silver Wolf King might be the type of failed Silver-tier creature Zhou Tao had mentioned, its residual silver blood being incredibly valuable.

At noon, when the night was relatively lighter, Qin Ming arrived at the neighboring village, Liu Village, where a bloody incident had also occurred and had already been reported. This place was quite bright, possessing a Level 2 Fire Spring, significant enough to establish a town.

"Young master, are you here alone?" The people of Liu Village seemed disappointed to see how young Qin Ming was, wondering if he had offended someone to be assigned to such a case.

Qin Ming took out a string of wolf fangs, and immediately, the old village chief of Liu Village brightened up, highly excited. "Young master, you're truly capable! You've solved the wolf problem in the neighboring village?"

Without further delay, he quickly recounted the details: a Bird Demon frequently appeared, having already devoured four people. "It's too brutal. Liu Dazhuang had already undergone a second rebirth, but that Bird Demon flew down, and with one claw, it ripped open his skull right at his doorstep, slowly sucking out his brain fluid before eating most of his flesh."

The old village chief estimated that this Bird Demon might have committed bloody acts elsewhere and wasn't specifically targeting their village, otherwise, the situation would have been even worse.

"Do you know where its nest is?" Qin Ming didn't want to wait and wished to search actively, as another day's delay could mean another lost life.

"It should be in the dense forest over ten miles away..." The old village chief trembled as he pointed to the distant old forest.

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming immediately set off. Half an hour later, in the dense woodland, he found the Bird Demon described in the reports: five meters long, with grayish-black feathers, a human face, and a beak as sharp as a scimitar. Moreover, it was a pair of Bird Demons that had built a nest in an old tree, already having laid five patterned eggs. If they hatched, the young birds would cause even greater havoc.

A moment later, Qin Ming drew his bow and shot an arrow, blowing up one Bird Demon and gravely wounding another. He left one alive to gather information. Finally, he learned that the two Bird Demons couldn't survive in the Godfall Plains and had come to the outskirts to breed and raise their young; they were, in fact, weaker creatures that had been eliminated from the inner plains.

Qin Ming smacked the injured one to death, then unleashed a punch that shattered the bird's nest, sending egg fluid splattering. This was his first "extermination" operation, leaving no survivors, regardless of whether they were "old or young."

Qin Ming pressed on relentlessly, solving the problems encountered by four villages in a single day. In the area he was responsible for, only Stone Fortress Village remained, and the bloody incident there was the most troublesome. It involved an Ancient Demon with extremely profound cultivation, rumored to have lived for at least a hundred years.

After learning the details, Qin Ming's expression became incredibly serious. The people of Stone Fortress Village looked distraught, sighing deeply, as this Ancient Demon was somewhat related to their village.

"There's more to it?" Qin Ming inquired carefully.

"It's an old donkey that came from our village. They say old dogs return to the mountains; this donkey, too, grew more demonic with age and eventually ran deep into the Godfall Plains." The hundred-year-old donkey, having been "enslaved" and forced into hard labor in Stone Fortress Village, mutated and made a name for itself in the Godfall Plains, then returned for revenge. Two years ago, it had already tormented and killed over a dozen people, all descendants of its former owner. Now, it didn't visit the village often but had abducted many people to serve it on Thunderpeak Mountain.

Qin Ming listened, engrossed. An old donkey seeking revenge? After a hundred years, it still remembered. Most crucially, it actually had three sworn brothers: the Silver Wolf King was one of them, along with a monstrous beast and a terrifying Black Roc.

Qin Ming's expression turned grave. A hundred-year-old demon was already intimidating, and the Silver Wolf King made him very wary. Now, two more monsters were involved. Killing any one of them could provoke retaliation from the other three Ancient Demons. Qin Ming, who always overestimated his opponents, felt that this time it was a hellish difficulty!

He carefully assessed the situation. Even a top-tier异人 (Eren) who had undergone nine rebirths would likely face dire consequences trying to solve this problem. Unless he abandoned the people of Stone Fortress Village, found a way to kill the old donkey, and immediately fled, leaving the area entirely. But doing so wouldn't solve the problem; it would stir up an even greater bloody catastrophe, as the other three Ancient Demons would surely seek瘋狂 (mad) revenge, potentially massacring entire villages and towns.

"Are the bloody incidents that Cui Chongxuan, Zhuo Ya, and Cao Wuji face also this difficult?" Qin Ming suddenly felt that entering the Six Supremacies' ancestral gates wasn't so easy after all. He didn't act rashly, as there was still ample time; Zhou Tao, an elder of the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court, had told them to return in half a month.

Over the next two days, Qin Ming stealthily entered the Godfall Plains to learn about the four Ancient Demons, cautiously approaching their territories to seek opportunities.

On Thunderpeak Mountain, more than twenty young men and women, clad in rags, were washing clothes, cooking, and preparing food for donkey demons, dog demons, rat demons, and other monsters. This old donkey had dozens of subordinates. When it traveled, it was carried in a palanquin, sitting upright with a long, solemn donkey face, looking very dignified.

The Wolf Den, not small in scale, was quite majestic, primarily built from crimson crystal stones found in the Godfall Plains, giving it an overall vibrant red hue. Reflected by the fire springs, it looked as if it were smeared with blood. Although Qin Ming only caught a fleeting glance from a distance, he felt that the Silver Wolf King was even more formidable than Master Huang, definitely a powerful enemy. Most importantly, it had over a hundred subordinates, all large wolf monsters.

Qin Ming most wanted to target it because, among the four Ancient Demons, it was surprisingly the weakest. The two strongest were naturally the monstrous beast and the Black Roc. Furthermore, if the Silver Wolf King was a failed Silver-tier creature, the residual silver blood in its body could help Qin Ming achieve a seventh rebirth! If he broke through again, his strength would reach a new level, perhaps allowing him to deal with all four Ancient Demons!

Qin Ming stared in the direction of the Wolf Den, his eyes burning with desire, but he knew very well that unless he could succeed with one strike, he would be in considerable danger. After all, the territories of the four Ancient Demons were not far from each other.

Qin Ming moved through the Godfall Plains, encountering many monsters and also human adventurers. He had tried to invite others to join him in eliminating the demons, but as soon as they heard whom he intended to confront, they immediately refused. "That monster probably has wondrous blood!" Qin Ming had observed the monstrous beast multiple times. It was covered in fiery red scales and was not the mythical mountain-sized behemoth. It was more robust than an elephant, but for ordinary humans, especially in the outer regions of the Godfall Plains, it was definitely considered a colossal beast.

The next day, Qin Ming saw the most terrifying Black Roc, its entire body shimmering with dark light, fly away from the mountain it occupied and head deep into the Godfall Plains. Immediately, his spirits lifted; an opportunity seemed to have arrived. At this time, that monstrous beast should be feeding, right?

He traversed the forest, approaching the monstrous beast's habitat. The monstrous beast resembled a fire lion covered in scarlet scales, flames spewing from its mouth and nostrils. Its diet included various strange creatures, including mutated elephants. Its feeding scene was incredibly bloody; it sat there, gnawing on an elephant leg with its massive claw, blood staining the entire ground.

"It ate half an elephant. According to its habits, it will probably sleep for half a day. This opportunity must not be missed!" Qin Ming vanished from the spot, quickly arriving at the Wolf Den! This time, he would go all out, preparing for a fatal strike. In the darkness, Qin Ming drew his Mutton-fat Jade Iron Blade, awaiting the perfect moment. The Wolf Den, built primarily from crimson crystal stones, was majestic, tall, and blood-red, exuding a strong sense of oppression.

Half a quarter of an hour later, the Silver Wolf King came out for air after eating fresh blood and flesh. It walked upright, about four meters tall, and incredibly strong. Its silver fur glowed with brilliant light in the night, making it very conspicuous.

After firing four Jade Iron Arrows, Qin Ming didn't care if they hit. He held his Jade Iron Blade and, with a powerful gust of wind, charged forward at his fastest speed. The Silver Wolf King grunted; it had been struck by two arrows but had avoided vital points. Blood bloomed on its silver fur. Enraged, it threw its head back, about to let out a wolf howl. Qin Ming flicked his wrist, sending another Jade Iron Arrow straight towards its gaping maw. The Silver Wolf King quickly shut its mouth and dodged its head.

With a crash, brilliant blade light erupted. Qin Ming reached close quarters and engaged the Silver Wolf King in a life-or-death battle. In this brief moment, both attacked fiercely. The Silver Wolf King's large claws looked as if their nails had been clipped, becoming blunt and bloody. But it also successfully drew its wolf-tooth club. Its wolf claws glowed, and it swung the heavy weapon, continuously smashing it towards its opponent.

Qin Ming's expression was grim; this was indeed a formidable opponent, incredibly powerful. He fought with all his might, his Heavenly Light Energy seemingly burning. The Silver Wolf King was struck by his blade but didn't fall, proving remarkably tenacious.

*Pfft!*

Qin Ming held nothing back, already employing his strongest techniques, and left another wound on the Silver Wolf King, almost severing its neck. This time, the Silver Wolf King was startled, roaring repeatedly, its entire body boiling with silver light as it fought desperately. Many surrounding wolf monsters came to assist, but none could withstand Qin Ming's terrifying blade light.

"Step aside, all of you!" a cold voice rang out from mid-air, and all the wolf monsters retreated like a tide.

"Big brother, you're finally here! I didn't expect someone would actually dare to come for us!" The Silver Wolf King immediately cried out upon seeing its savior.

Qin Ming's heart sank. Looking up, he saw a fierce raptor like a black sun, radiating dark light, incredibly sinister and terrifying. Its wings flapped, emitting powerful energy fluctuations. The ground trembled, and not far away, a monstrous beast covered in crimson scales appeared. It resembled a lion, with elephant blood hanging from its mouth, its tusks protruding, looking savage and ferocious. From the other side, an old donkey with glowing fur appeared, carried in a palanquin. It lifted the curtain, its gaze cold.

Qin Ming sighed. He never imagined the worst-case scenario would come true. All four Ancient Demons, each more brutal than the last, had arrived and surrounded him at the Wolf Den. This was the most dangerous situation Qin Ming had encountered since embarking on his path of rebirth, truly a hellish difficulty!
