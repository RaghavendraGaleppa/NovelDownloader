# Chapter 73: A Change in Plans for Entering the City  

The editor has informed me that the book will be officially released tomorrow at 8 AM, the usual update time.  

Reaching this stage hasn’t been easy. The journey involved fierce competition with many other books—from signing contracts to entering the catalog, then progressing through recommendation rounds one after another. None of this would have been possible without your support.  

Thank you, fellow Daoists!  

Allow this humble cultivator to bow to you with a newly learned gesture.  

Over the past month, I’ve written with trepidation, but your companionship, advice, monthly votes, recommendations, comments, and even the meticulous proofreading, generous rewards, and encouragement from senior cultivators—along with the silent return of old friends from my previous book—have kept me going.  

Let’s raise a cup of spiritual wine together. After this toast, we continue forward.  

Regrettably, the book’s recommendation period ended at the Three Rivers stage. I thought the performance was decent, but we fell just short in reader engagement, losing the competition. It’s not that this book is weak—it’s just that the competitors were too strong, all masters of their craft. I’ve read their works and learned much from them.  

But as the saying goes, flowing water doesn’t compete for speed—it competes in endurance. There’s still a long road ahead, and I’ll write steadily. Rest assured, fellow readers.  

This book has undergone multiple revisions.  

The first draft was handed to my editor, Green Bean, who rejected it with four words: *"Morally questionable."*  

Wait—I’m a model student, a virtuous youth, a pillar of society! Since childhood, I’ve aspired to be a successor of socialism. My moral compass is definitely sound.  

...If there’s a problem, it must lie with the demonic cultivator—Wang Chan.  

I’ll arrange for a certain Daoist surnamed Han to teach him a lesson later.  

Second draft feedback: *"Tone it down."*  

Third draft feedback: *"Be more subtle."*  

...  

Thanks to Brother Bean’s patient guidance, this book took shape.  

What’s it about?  

The story of a lowly, rootless demonic cultivator who schemes his way to immortality.  

A fellow Daoist recently mentioned *Qingyi the Hermit* from *Renegade Immortal*—a demonic rogue cultivator who reached the Nascent Soul stage. Whether in the novel or the adaptation, the character was brilliantly portrayed. The animation’s depiction of the *Qingming Needle* technique remains vivid in my memory.  

I wanted to write a story about a rogue demonic cultivator too.  

Unlike sect or aristocratic cultivators, rogue cultivators have shallow roots. They rely entirely on themselves, but that also means fewer entanglements, fewer worries, fewer bonds...  

One of this book’s themes is *walking the path alone*.  

Life is the same. Beyond yourself, everyone else in this world is just a passing traveler, connections forming and fading.  

When you’re at your lowest, lost in confusion, when the world seems bleak... no one can save you but yourself.

**Theme Two: Freedom and Clarity of Mind**  

This could also be called *seeking within*.  

Seeking externally will always leave the mind unsettled, never truly free—because the world is vast, and human hearts are fickle.  

Only by turning inward can one achieve true clarity and freedom.  

Themes three, four, five... I won’t elaborate here. They’ll unfold naturally.  

There are many demonic cultivator stories out there. I’ve read plenty, taken notes, and developed my own ideas.  

Honestly, the outlines, settings, and research for this book exceed the current word count.  

Many readers have noticed: despite having a system, the pacing leans toward traditional xianxia. Why?  

I want to tell a story properly, letting it unfold gradually.  

Going too fast would ruin it. While web novels must make a living, there should still be some pursuit of quality. After all, if I can sit down and write, it’s because I love this craft.  

Doing what you love is a blessing.  

Traditional or not, genre doesn’t matter. Pacing doesn’t matter. Even prose isn’t the most important.  

What matters is whether your words move the reader, whether your story immerses them and stirs their emotions.  

I’ve always believed writing fiction is like being a person: if you want others to like you, the key lies in mutual attraction, shared ideals, and resonance.  

Yes, friends are drawn to you, not begged for.  

Readers are the same.  

So, if you’ve met me through this book, it means we resonate.  

Let’s resonate harmoniously.  

Traditionally, release announcements involve some melodrama.  

But since you’ve read this far, you must already approve of the book—and likely the protagonist too.  

By the law of attraction, that means you’re all... perceptive individuals. Melodramatic tricks would only amuse you.  

I won’t play that game. I’ll just bow to you. In this vast world, meeting you through this book is rare. A toast to myself, and to all of you.  

Tomorrow, Wang Chan will reach the mid-stage of Qi Refining, marking a small breakthrough before entering White Mountain City to begin his life as a rogue cultivator.  

Normally, releases end on a cliffhanger, but I’ll leave that to fate.  

For updates:  

10,000 words tomorrow.  

Now that the book is live, I’ll strive for more frequent updates. More effort, more rewards.

**Final Words**  

May all go well for you, fellow Daoists, and may fortune favor your path!

### Chapter 73: A Change in Plans for Entering the City  

*Why is she here so late at night?*  

Wang Chan frowned.  

Their relationship wasn’t close enough for midnight visits.  

*No one comes uninvited without a reason. Could there be a problem with entering the city?*  

His heart sank. After all, Madam Cheng had been forced to...
