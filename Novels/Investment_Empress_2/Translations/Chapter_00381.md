# Chapter 381: Immortal Xiao Li's Confidence, Entering the Game!

"Truly worthy of being my brother. You saw through it at a glance."

Luo Yexian nodded, affirming Li Mo's statement.

Tan Zhuyin and the group of Demon Summoning Sect disciples stared intently below, as if wanting to know if there were any changes here now that the Dream God had sensed the power of the living beings.

Unfortunately, there were none.

Well, to be honest, even without the change, they couldn't see much on their own.

The Demon Summoning Sect was not a sect that studied the trends of Yin-Yang, the Five Elements, or Feng Shui. The information they knew came from the research of the former Yin-Yang Hall.

However, there was a highly promising young junior in the Yin-Yang Hall who had ambitions of replacing Tan Zhuyin's position as the圣子 (Holy Son).

Naturally, Tan Zhuyin and the others couldn't wait for that person to come and investigate together. They could only look at Li Mo again.

Li Mo laughed dryly. "You discovered this place long ago, haven't you unraveled any of its mysteries?"

"That is why we wish to consult you, Immortal."

Tan Zhuyin stopped Luo Yexian, who wanted to speak, with a look.

Li Mo pretended to be pondering the chess game, but in reality, he was listening to the voice of the "Ice Cube" transmitting from the Great Yin Divine Will:

"This place was arranged by someone using great means. They used the qi of the mountain peaks as chess pieces to form a formation, gathering the spiritual and evil qi of this Feng Shui treasure land accumulated over thousands of years."

"If you don't break this formation and rashly enter, you will be devoured by the formation of spiritual and evil qi."

"But at the same time, the spiritual and evil qi will also breed heavenly treasures or extremely fierce creatures."

As he listened, the Immortal "Black Earth" relayed the information.

The playful, knowing smile in his eyes grew even thicker.

Just from the Ice Cube's tone, one could tell this formation was not easy to break. No wonder these demonic sect members looked at the Broken Axe Mountain Range with not only longing for opportunity but also deep apprehension.

The Demon Summoning Sect had clearly investigated this place more than once.

But it was also clear that every time they returned empty-handed, and they probably suffered quite a few setbacks.

"Brother Black Earth, to be honest with you,"

Luo Yexian spoke up after receiving a look from Tan Zhuyin. "Long ago, the sect tried to send people into the Broken Axe Mountain Range. But no matter which direction they went, they would eventually arrive before a giant chessboard."

"If they强行 (forcibly) charged in without playing, they would be反噬 (counter-attacked) by the spiritual and evil qi."

"If they played... the outcome wasn't much better."

Luo Yexian recounted the story.

It turned out that according to the sect's records, the Yin-Yang Hall once had a master of the Physical Body realm. He had perfected the arts of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, and his chess skill was unrivaled in the world. He once played against the Grand Chancellor of the Great Yu Dynasty for three days and three nights, ultimately winning by two stones and taking the title of 'Chess Sage.'

That前辈 (senior), bearing the title of Chess Sage, came to the Broken Axe Mountain with full confidence to challenge it.

He left, and did not return for seven years.

When the Chess Sage returned, his physical body was withered, and he was almost half-crazy, constantly shouting the words 'Break the Formation.'

Moreover, from his mouth, it could be vaguely discerned that he was not the first chess master to come to the Broken Axe Mountain.

The higher one's chess skill, the deeper one would fall. Among them, there was even the remains of a Xuan-level master who had been dead for an unknown number of years, playing until his death, becoming a 'chess slave.'

"Ice Cube, are you confident in this chess formation?"

Li Mo was waiting to go home for the New Year. Forget ten years, he didn't want to be trapped there for even ten and a half days.

"This formation is indeed变幻莫测 (unpredictable)."

"Is it difficult?"

The Ice Cube paused for a moment before her clear and melodious voice continued, "Hmm, I might not be able to win by too many stones."

"....."

So the Ice Cube wasn't thinking about whether she could win or not.

She was thinking about *how much* she would win by?

This damn sense of security!

Fortunately, the Ice Cube was reliable. Otherwise, if he had just said he would 'make a slight move,' and then upon arriving said 'sorry to bother you, I have no solution,' wouldn't his image as the Heaven尊's disciple, the Immortal Black Earth, be ruined?

"Heh, have you not heard that heaven never seals off all paths?何况 (what's more) it's just a chess game."

The Immortal Black Earth stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the mountain range below that was spread out like a starry sky, his tone revealing immense confidence.

After hearing the previous stories, he was not afraid at all, and instead seemed to have finally stirred a bit of interest.

"Can you break this formation?!"

A fierce light flashed in the eyes of the Demon Summoning圣子 (Holy Son).

"I'll try to win by as many stones as possible."

"!!!"

The demonic sect members looked at each other in bewilderment. A formation that had left the Demon Summoning Sect helpless for thousands of years, and this person hadn't even considered the possibility of losing?

"However... my Master has need of some power of the living beings lately..."

The Immortal's voice took a turn.

---

Luo Yexian immediately understood. This was asking for a "tribute." He looked at Tan Zhuyin with his eyes.

Tan Zhuyin calculated quickly in his heart and nodded. "If you truly break this formation, my Divine Sect will owe you a great debt. It is only natural to repay you with a gift."

The power of the living beings could be collected again once it was gone.

As for which was more important, even a fool would know which choice to make.

"Please."

Tan Zhuyin got off his palanquin and personally invited him.

"Oh, quite sensible."

Li Mo had a look of approval, the kind a senior gives to a junior.

I have to say, being a senior is quite satisfying.

Tan Zhuyin: "....."

He felt like he was being taken advantage of, but he had no proof.

And why was Luo Yexian looking at him with such envy?

Thus, the group entered the Broken Axe Mountain Range.

Immediately, white mist surged, and one could not see their own hand in front of their face. This white mist seemed to be impenetrable even to the soul, making it impossible to know where they were. Plus, the mist was so thick, even someone with a great sense of direction would lose their bearings upon entering.

Fortunately, the moonlight could still shine through.

The group remained calm and not panicked.

After all, no matter which way they went, they would end up in the same place. And none of them knew how to play chess, so they weren't afraid of being trapped inside.

In the eyes of the demonic sect members, the only person who might be trapped was Li Mo.

But they didn't know that Li Mo wasn't even a "chess篓子" (a bad chess player). He might understand a little about Gomoku.

The Immortal Xiao Li was responsible for the external image.

The Immortal Han was responsible for the chess skills.

One handled the outside, one handled the inside. A man and a woman working together, the work was not tiring.

The Ice Cube only needed to think about how to win the game, while Xiao Li had much more to consider.

"And it has to be a beautiful win."

Li Mo touched the Shenshen Spirit Pearl in his chest.

Half an hour later.

Passing through layers of mist, the view suddenly opened up. Besides the moonlight, the stars in the sky seemed to suddenly shine much brighter, illuminating the scene before them clearly.

A wide and ancient chessboard was laid flat on the ground. The black and white stones on it were distinct, yet intricately entangled.

The chessboard was huge, like a plaza.

Li Mo recognized that the layout of the stones on it corresponded to the distribution of the mountains in the Broken Axe Mountain Range outside.

Not only the chessboard, but also many skeletons sitting cross-legged in place.

"That should be a senior from the Yin-Yang Hall..."

A Demon Summoning disciple recognized the clothing on one of the skeletons!

Evidently, this person was extraordinary in life. Though dead for an unknown number of years, their clothing had not decayed.

Li Mo swept a glance with his Heaven's Fate Divine Eye.

He could confirm that these deceased chess masters were definitely, completely dead, and had died at different times, a fact that could be seen from the era characteristics on their clothing.

"This place should have existed since the end of the Shang Dynasty and the beginning of the Yu Dynasty," Li Mo judged.

"Will these powerful beings revive..."

Luo Yexian, having spent a long time with Han Zhen, always felt that these people who had been dead for years might suddenly stand up...

As soon as he finished speaking.

*Clatter—*

A glimmer of green flame suddenly ignited in the hollow eye sockets of those skeletons, and they all stood up one by one.

They all, in unison, turned their gaze towards the group.

It was as if they were waiting for a wonderful game of chess.

"Gasp..." Luo Yexian's scalp went numb.

Tan Zhuyin's facial skin writhed, a trace of blood color appearing on it. Thin scales covered his neck, and a faint dragon's might emanated from him.

"What is going on?"

Li Mo did not act rashly.

After the figure in the moon told him, he let out a sigh of relief and said calmly, "No need to worry, these skeletons are harmless."

"They have been dead for many years, and because they were nourished by the spiritual and evil qi, a single obsession in their chests has not yet dissipated, that's all."

"They just... want to see this formation broken, even in death."
