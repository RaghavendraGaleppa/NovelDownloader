# Chapter 31: Wutian Pavilion

Seven days had passed since that last long rest—not that Zhou Tian slept for seven consecutive days, but rather that the preceding days had been uneventful. Today, however, was different. A few days prior, Uncle Zhou had informed him that his two elder brothers were due to return today.

It had been mentioned before that his two elder brothers were perpetually away on campaigns. Zhou Tian didn't know their specific locations, and despite inquiring several times, he never heard of any ongoing wars. Not only his two brothers, but also Zhou Xun Chuan’s two elder brothers—the First and Second Princes—as well as the descendants of many court ministers who were also fighting abroad, were said to be returning today. In his original body's memories, there wasn't much recollection of his two elder brothers; after all, he was only sixteen or seventeen, and they hadn't returned more than a few times in the past decade or so.

As Zhou Tian was pondering how to idly pass the day, a pillar of azure light suddenly soared into the sky from the direction of the cultivation chamber. Within the light pillar, a translucent longsword gleamed, its radiance dazzling and its sharp aura potent.

"Did someone break through?" Zhou Tian's face broke into a smile. He recognized the phenomenon of a breakthrough. Tian Ling's cultivation retreat for so many days had bored him to death; finally, he could go out and play with her today.

He hurried towards the cultivation chamber. By the time he arrived, Tian Ling had already pushed open the door and stepped out. Despite being secluded for so many days, Tian Ling showed no signs of being unkempt; in fact, her skin appeared even more lustrous. Seeing Zhou Tian appear before the cultivation chamber, a clear expression of happiness bloomed on her face, and she walked up to him, unsure what to say.

"Did you break through?" Zhou Tian took the initiative to start the conversation.

"Mm." Tian Ling nodded slightly and said, "I've broken through to the Earth Treasury Realm. The divine ability I developed perfectly complements the Heavenly Treasury Divine Ability." As she spoke, her face glowed with an unusual brilliance, a mix of pride and a desire to show off, as if seeking praise from Zhou Tian. While the luxurious Zhou family cultivation chamber played a significant role in her breakthrough, it was inseparable from her own talent and diligence.

"Good, good! Our Ling'er is the most amazing!" Zhou Tian said with a smile, patting Tian Ling’s head. This heartfelt head-patting was a fatal blow!

A blush spread across Tian Ling's cheeks, and her beautiful large eyes narrowed slightly. She found the sensation surprisingly pleasant, and her head unconsciously nudged further into Zhou Tian's palm. Zhou Tian's heart stirred at the cat-like scene, a subtle warmth spreading through him in appreciative respect.

Arching his back slightly, Zhou Tian said, "Let's go. I'll take you out for something delicious. Later tonight, the brothers who were out campaigning will all be back, and the Imperial Palace will host a banquet. You and I must both attend." This was a celebration banquet, and all the prominent figures in the Imperial Capital were expected to attend, himself included. Tian Ling didn’t strictly need to go, but Zhou Tian thought it would be boring to go alone, so it was better to bring his girlfriend.

"Mm…" Tian Ling nodded, feeling a little shy about her earlier actions.

Soon after, a carriage was prepared, and the two left the Prince of Qin’s Estate.

As the Youth Tournament approached, more and more people arrived in the Imperial Capital. These individuals came from different factions and various places, all with one goal: the Youth Tournament! Although many people had arrived, the Imperial Capital's roads were incredibly wide, still making the city seem somewhat spacious and uncrowded.

"Disciples of the Six Devils of Dangshan," Tian Ling observed from inside the carriage, looking through its transparent walls at several strangely dressed men on the street.

"People from the Yihua Palace," she murmured as several scantily clad young women walked past.

"People of the Northern Desert Sands," she noted as a humanoid creature, entirely covered in white sand with no discernible features, ambled by. The sand on its body seemed to flow, yet not a single grain fell behind it.

Tian Ling recognized all the people with appearances vastly different from the Imperial Capital’s residents, or even non-human species, as if counting her family treasures. Zhou Tian, however, recognized none of them. They were merely forces under the Great Qin Empire, or registered within it. He had no need to know them; in front of him, all these people were like "little brothers" (inferiors).

Although many non-Imperial Capital residents had arrived, these individuals had inquired about the Imperial Capital's power structures and knew who not to provoke. Along the way, no one ignorant of their place dared to cause trouble, which left Zhou Tian, who had hoped to experience showing off and slapping faces, feeling slightly disappointed.

After about a quarter of an hour, Zhou Tian’s carriage arrived at the entrance of Wutian Pavilion.

Wutian Pavilion was the largest establishment in the Imperial Capital, offering a variety of top-tier services. It was rumored that the figure behind it had an ambiguous relationship with the Qin Emperor.

Wutian Pavilion had no main gate; four cloud-patterned jade pillars supported the entire building. It was brilliantly lit and operated twenty-four hours a day. A group of young women stood outside, and Zhou Tian, accompanied by a dedicated greeter, entered the establishment. He had brought Tian Ling here once before, so he was familiar with the layout.

However, this time, Zhou Tian suddenly thought of someone: Zhou Zui! Since his series of frights at the Prince of Qin’s Estate last time, that fellow hadn't sought him out these past few days. Zhou Tian had tried visiting a few times, but Zhou Zui had always managed to avoid him.

Glancing at the young woman in luxurious clothes beside him, Zhou Tian mused, "Take me to Zhou Zui's room. I have an appointment with him!" The commotion surrounding Zhou Zui seemed to have died down. That fellow spent at least eleven out of every ten days here. Directly asking the staff would surely not get him answers, so Zhou Tian decided to try a little deception.

The greeter didn't suspect anything and bowed slightly, saying, "Yes, Young Master, please follow me."

Wutian Pavilion didn't use direct teleportation arrays; after all, it provided various services, and it wouldn’t do if a guest in a VIP room was in the middle of "business." So, they used a system similar to elevators.

Following the woman, they reached the VIP room floor near the top. The decor here was exceptionally luxurious. The floor was covered with a fiery red, soft carpet that gave a warm and comfortable feeling when stepped on, clearly indicating that the animal whose fur it came from had possessed extraordinary might in life. They arrived outside a VIP room, its door entirely crafted from golden-veined millennium nanmu wood.

Seeing the maid about to knock, Zhou Tian quickly stopped her and said, "No need. Just open the door directly. I have an appointment with him." The maid's face showed reluctance, but after seeing Zhou Tian frown slightly, she immediately nodded and said, "Yes."

She took out a special key, inserted it into the empty space before the door, and layers of golden runic formations appeared, with chains encircling them. As the key gently turned, the formations vanished and the chains shattered. Seeing the door open, Zhou Tian nodded and said, "You can go now." The maid bowed and withdrew.

He then turned to Tian Ling, who had been silent by his side, and said, "You wait here first. I'll go in and take a look." Zhou Tian was afraid that Zhou Zui might be "busy" inside and stain his Ling'er's pure heart.

Pushing open the door, a fragrant aroma wafted out. The entire room was adorned in shades of pink, and a series of bell-like giggles mixed with Zhou Zui's lewd laughter filled the air. On a large table in the center, a grand feast was laid out, consisting entirely of rare ingredients not often seen in the outside world. Four scantily clad women surrounded Zhou Zui in the middle, feeding him exotic fruits in a peculiar manner. Zhou Zui's clothes were disheveled, and both his hands had already strayed to "indescribable places."
