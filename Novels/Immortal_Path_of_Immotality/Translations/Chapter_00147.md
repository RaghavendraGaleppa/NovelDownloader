# Chapter 146: The Beauty's Demise

"Cough! Cough! Cough!"

As the smoke cleared, Qi Zhong, the true disciple of Qianyun Pavilion, was vomiting blood continuously. His high-grade magic robe was tattered, and the various jade accessories and magical instruments he wore had been reduced to dust. Looking around in dismay, he realized with despair that he and Princess Guo had been blasted back to the central command tent by another round of cannon fire—effectively right back where they started.

*Slap! Slap! Slap!*

*Hee-haw!*

Nearby, the giant water bear was mercilessly beating the skinny donkey, its massive paws—each the size of a human face—landing with brutal force, making the poor beast wail in pain. The water bear was excellent in every way, save for its unfortunate habit of always aiming for the face.

Qi Zhong's face twitched. It felt like the bear was slapping him instead.

At that moment, Lin Shan noticed that the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had arrived at some point and had even set up a formation and artillery positions. Overjoyed, he realized that with this net cast, no matter how capable his enemies were, they wouldn't be able to escape.

The black skeleton on the other side let out a strange cry and waved at Lin Shan.

Qi Zhong was in a pitiful state, a far cry from the dashing and confident young man he had been when he first appeared. The refined true disciple of a major sect had now become nothing more than a fish on the chopping block, a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

"Cough! Junior Sister Guo, I've done my best."

Princess Guo looked at the disheveled young man beside her, and for the first time, her heart wavered with emotion. She had always used her charm to string him along, relying on his background to secure her own future. She never expected him to be so deeply devoted.

"Senior Brother Qi, I—"

"Don't say anything. None of this is your fault! I've never blamed you. This is just how the world is—you did nothing wrong."

"Senior Brother Qi, actually—"

"I know! I know everything! Even though you led me on, you still felt guilty. Deep down, you're kind-hearted."

"Senior Brother Qi, that's not—"

"Junior Sister Guo! I understand what you mean! You still think this isn't worth it—that I shouldn't throw away my future for you. But you don't know—"

"I meant... your pants are ripped."

...

Qi Zhong looked down abruptly and realized that his mid-grade magic undergarments had been torn open at some point, revealing a charred black mess between his legs, with only a burnt stick dangling in the air.

Looking up, he saw Princess Guo turning her head away in embarrassment, Luan Chun covering her face shyly, Lin Shan sneering disdainfully at his size, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord cackling lewdly, and the water bear leader smugly gesturing at its own massive... endowment.

---

Gritting his teeth against the humiliation, the true disciple of Qianyun Pavilion quickly pulled out another pair of magic undergarments. One had to admire his preparedness—even his spare clothes were magical artifacts.

"My apologies. That was... unbecoming of me."

Qi Zhong gazed deeply at the icy beauty beside him. Even in their direst moment, she remained as cold and stunning as ever. Her face, the one he had longed for in countless sleepless nights, was still so captivating.

It was a shame he had never even held her hand, let alone tasted her lips.

"Junior Sister Guo, if there's a next life, I won't regret my decision!"

Princess Guo's heart finally softened. She had always believed men were nothing but trouble, yet here was one willing to sacrifice everything for love. Biting her lip, she seemed to struggle with a difficult decision.

But in the next moment, Qi Zhong—who had just been the picture of devoted affection—suddenly erupted in a crimson glow, burning his lifeblood to fuel a desperate escape. He shot toward the sky like a blazing comet.

Facing the Inverted Five Elements Formation that had sealed off all escape routes, he unleashed the final use of his "Gengjin Sword Qi"—a gift from his elders—hoping it would carve a path to freedom.

If he could just escape and return to Qianyun Pavilion, he would remain the revered true disciple. What beauty couldn't he obtain? What magical treasures couldn't he forge? What spirit beast couldn't he buy? Everything he had lost could be regained.

Given another chance, he would never regret this choice.

Everyone else watched in stunned silence as the crimson streak that was Qi Zhong—who had just been a lovesick fool—suddenly transformed into a man hellbent on survival.

Princess Guo's face was a picture of disbelief, her mind a tangled mess of emotions.

The Gengjin Sword Qi streaked across the sky like a meteor, its speed unmatched, its sword-song resonating through the heavens.

*Rip!*

The colorful formation was torn open, revealing a gap just tall enough for a person. Qi Zhong's face lit up with manic joy as he surged through.

"Hahaha! Farewell, fools—"

*Thud!*

His triumphant shout was cut short by a sickening impact.

A second radiant barrier rose from the ground, composed of countless interlocking prismatic panels that shimmered with an alluring glow.

"Keh keh keh! Did I ever say I only set up *one* Inverted Five Elements Formation?"

"How do you like my Kunzhen Hexagonal Prism Formation, eh?"

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord dispelled the first formation, revealing the second prismatic prison. Qi Zhong crashed to the ground, bloodied and wailing in pain.

---

The impact left him dazed, his head splitting, his qi and blood in turmoil.

The onlookers were floored by the sheer overkill. The Black Skeleton Demon Lord's paranoia knew no bounds—who would have thought he'd layer one defensive formation over another?

Was this some kind of twisted nesting doll?!

Lin Shan couldn't help but admire the old skeleton's cunning. If not for this, Qi Zhong might have actually escaped.

A disciple of a major sect like him could easily make a comeback. The fact that he had reached mid Foundation Establishment while still so young spoke volumes about his terrifying talent.

Moreover, the sheer number of high-grade magical artifacts he carried suggested he might have crafted them himself. Given time, he could easily rearm himself. While Lin Shan could overpower him, killing him outright was another matter.

If not for Luan Chun's trump card—a life-saving artifact given to her by the Golden Core elder Yan—they might not have broken through Qi Zhong's defenses. And the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's double-layered formations and artillery had been the final nail in the coffin.

Still, the demon lord was his contracted partner, so this was all part of his own strength. There was no unfairness here.

Ignoring the pitiful wails of the now-defanged tiger, Lin Shan turned to Princess Guo, who sat slumped on the ground. Instead of despair, her expression was one of relief, as if a great burden had been lifted.

Lin Shan considered speaking but held his tongue. He knew better than to monologue at the climax—that was how villains lost.

*"Heh—"*

Just as he was about to strike the killing blow, the cornered Princess Guo suddenly laughed, a sound so unexpected it gave everyone pause.

Shaking her head, as if finally understanding something—perhaps mocking herself for nearly falling for love, or the fickleness of human nature—she triggered something behind her.

The central command tent suddenly blazed with light as intricate runic patterns emerged, converging into a glowing array beneath her feet.

Everyone stared in shock. No one had noticed her setting this up right under their noses.

"Lin Shan, I never imagined you'd grow so quickly. Even Qi Zhong was no match for you... You hid your strength well."

As she spoke, she produced an ancient formation disk that resonated with the array beneath her. The two connected instantly, swirling with a pale light that enveloped her.

"That sage was right... You truly are my destined calamity."

---

Her blue-robed figure grew hazy as the light intensified, the space around her distorting like ripples on water.

"Perhaps next time we meet, this will all be over."

*Whoosh!*

*Stab!*

"Guh—you?!"

Lin Shan's Severing Water Sword pierced her dantian in a flash, the formation beneath her crumbling under the strike of a magic treasure. A smirk played on his lips.

"You thought I didn't notice your little trick?"

While he had been fighting Qi Zhong, Princess Guo had been secretly preparing an escape route. But Lin Shan, ever wary of her schemes, had been watching closely.

Princess Guo's pale face twisted in disbelief as she felt her dantian shatter. The oppressive spiritual pressure radiating from Lin Shan's sword—a signature of magic treasures—drained her life force at an alarming rate.

"So... it ends like this... Hah... To die by your hand... perhaps this was fate after all..."

Her eyes glazed over, her soul flickering like a dying candle. She seemed to want to say more, but the words wouldn't come.

Lin Shan recalled her earlier mention of a "sage" and a "destined calamity." A suspicion gnawed at him—had her ambush on the road to Yichuan been part of something bigger?

"What were you trying to say?"

"Ghk—"

Blood bubbled from her lips, silencing her forever. Her aura plummeted, her misty eyes locking onto Lin Shan one last time, as if carrying a thousand unspoken thoughts, before—

Her beauty faded into death.

As her soul dissipated under the magic treasure's power, Lin Shan slowly withdrew his sword, his heart unsettled.

Princess Guo had been his first true nemesis in the world of cultivation. Time and again, she had ambushed him, her schemes endless. And now, she had finally fallen by his hand.

Though she had been his enemy, he couldn't help but feel a sliver of respect. Her existence had been a harsh but valuable lesson in his early days, a constant reminder of the dangers of this world. It was almost a pity—such talent and wit, extinguished just like that.

But then—

Princess Guo's lifeless body suddenly straightened, a foreign soul taking hold. Her eyes snapped open, but the cold, unfamiliar gaze sent chills down everyone's spines.

"Hmm? What's this? That little brat who trapped my soul fragment... is dead?"

"HAHAHA! Excellent! Marvelous!"

Lin Shan, Luan Chun, and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord tensed at the sudden shift, the eerie voice sending shivers down their spines.

"You're not Princess Guo. Who are you?"

The impostor spat blood, utterly indifferent to the fatal wound. A haughty smile played on her pale lips, the bearing of one born to rule.

She studied Lin Shan briefly before chuckling, her tone enigmatic.

"What a waste. To die at the hands of a mere early Foundation Establishment brat... And after I went through the trouble of foreseeing her calamity with a priceless treasure! 

"Ah well. Good riddance to that backstabbing wretch."

Lin Shan's mind reeled. Princess Guo had been someone's cauldron? And she had somehow turned the tables on her master through trickery?

Just who was this self-proclaimed "Holy Maiden"? And now that he'd destroyed her cauldron, would there be consequences?

"Relax. I have dozens of spare cauldrons. A few always die prematurely—hardly worth my time to intervene.

"But you... To kill one of mine, you must have some potential. If you ever find yourself at the Charm Palace..."

She licked her lips seductively, her gaze teasing.

"Come find me. I'll show you pleasures beyond your wildest dreams."

With that, the foreign soul dissipated, unable to linger any longer. Simultaneously, the formation beneath her flared to life, blue light spiraling upward before vanishing.

The command tent collapsed, revealing a pile of spent formation materials. Princess Guo's body crumpled to the ground.

"That 'Holy Maiden' is cunning. While she was talking, she secretly reactivated the teleportation formation—probably to retrieve something important," the Black Skeleton Demon Lord observed, examining the remnants.

Lin Shan checked Princess Guo's belongings. Her storage pouch was still there, but the "Talisman Jade Pendant" and the formation disk were gone.

He recalled her mentioning that the pendant contained a high-grade Golden Core spell, "Ten Thousand Blossoms Ice Mirror." Had that been the vessel for the Holy Maiden's soul fragment?

"Can you set up a teleportation formation?" Lin Shan asked, sensing there was more to this.

"Not yet. Teleportation requires spatial treasures like teleportation stones. Her formation disk was made from one," the demon lord replied gravely.

"Your Summoning Banner has teleportation stones. If you let me dismantle it, I could craft a disk for you."

As a master of both formations and artifact crafting—not to mention an entity that had once been at the Nascent Soul stage—it certainly had the expertise.

But Lin Shan wasn't about to sacrifice his banner. Besides, the treasures were already gone.

"Can you trace where she went?"

"Northwest. About a thousand miles."

Princess Guo and her backer had some skill in formations, but not enough to fool the demon lord. The small teleportation array's destination was easily deduced.

Lin Shan fell silent. A thousand miles put her in the territory of the Great Song capital, Bianliang. By now, she would have reinforcements waiting. Pursuit was pointless.

But... the Charm Palace? What kind of faction was that? He'd never heard of it—perhaps an organization from beyond the Great Song. And after killing the Holy Maiden's cauldron, was he really in the clear, as she claimed?

*Slap! Slap! Slap!*

*Hee-haw!*

On the other side of the field, the water bear was still pummeling the donkey, holding a grudge over that earlier kick. As the poor beast neared death, Luan Chun rushed to intervene.

Since she had helped earlier, Lin Shan let her be, recalling the water bear to the Summoning Banner and sending it back to the East Sea's Tempest Region.

Ignoring Luan Chun's attempts to tame the half-dead donkey, Lin Shan approached Qi Zhong's corpse. The young prodigy had burned through his lifeblood in his futile attempts to escape the formation.

With Princess Guo dead and her greatest ally slain, this chapter was finally closed.

As for Qianyun Pavilion losing a true disciple? Lin Shan couldn't care less. As a member of the demonic faction, killing a righteous sect disciple was just another notch on his belt—a significant contribution.

"The Kunzhen Hexagonal Prism Formation specializes in containment. Without something like the Gengjin Sword Qi, even burning his lifeblood wouldn't have broken it.

"So, little brother, was spending 50,000 spirit stones on formation materials worth it?" the Black Skeleton Demon Lord crowed, clearly angling for a share of the spoils.

"70-30 split," Lin Shan said flatly.

"70 for me?!" The demon lord was shocked at his generosity.

"Are you insane? *My* 70!"

Lin Shan glared. The skeleton had been getting too bold lately—forming artillery units, pushing boundaries. Maybe it was time for a reminder of who was in charge.

**[Author's Note]**

(If I have time later, I might write a side story about Princess Guo—how she obtained the Talisman Jade Pendant, how she deceived the Holy Maiden of the Charm Palace, and how she manipulated elders from Cangxuan Sect and disciples from Qianyun Pavilion to claw her way up.

This antagonist, who lasted over a hundred chapters, was crafted with care—almost like a dark mirror of the protagonist, with a maturity beyond her years.

But a hundred chapters is enough. Dragging it out would ruin it. Time to serve this long-standing villain her final meal.)
