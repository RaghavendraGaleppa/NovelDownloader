# Chapter 12: The Rogue Cultivator Market

The team leader, Li Wanhai, was also furious inside, but being older and more composed, he didn't show it on his face. Instead, he comforted the Li family members:

"Those Wang family upstarts who've gotten above themselves—their vision is just that limited."

"Don't pay them any mind. Petty tricks are all they're capable of."

Despite their anger and curses, all Li family members participating in this auction had been carefully selected. They understood Li Wanhai's words well.

Wei Qian observed the Li family's reactions and nodded inwardly.

The Li family's temperament was quite commendable. So far, he hadn't encountered any arrogant or unreasonable individuals among them.

In contrast, though he hadn't interacted much with the Wang family, every Wang cultivator he'd met seemed to have eyes on the top of their heads, looking down on everyone.

Despite their rampant arrogance and domineering attitude, the entire Wang family not only survived but thrived—all because they had two Foundation Establishment cultivators backing them!

This was the unshakable fundamental truth of the cultivation world: strength reigns supreme, and the powerful rule.

"Might makes right—it's practically gangster cultivation," Wei Qian suddenly thought of this phrase and found it fitting beyond words.

Suddenly, two powerful surges of spiritual energy emanated from the sky, causing many cultivators below to look up.

Two streaks of radiant light flew boldly into the stone hall of the auction house, where two elaborately dressed female cultivators greeted them with beaming smiles.

"Foundation Establishment cultivators... One day, I'll reach that level too," Wei Qian mouthed silently, making no sound.

"Wei Qian, come help me set up this tent so I can secure it!" The young mistress's eyes flickered as she noticed Wei Qian lost in thought and unceremoniously recruited him for the task.

Wei Qian turned back. "Alright, I'm coming." With that, he walked over to Li Caiwei.

Night fell, and inside the tent, two figures—one large, one small—huddled together.

Of course, these were Wei Qian and Li Guchen.

Though "Brother Qian" was actually older than Wei Qian, Li Guchen still addressed him as such.

"Brother Qian, what kind of treasures do you think will appear at the auction the day after tomorrow?" Li Guchen, attending his first auction, was visibly excited.

Wei Qian shifted a few times before finding a comfortable sleeping position. "No idea. But it'd be better if there aren't any overly impressive treasures. Otherwise, this place will be 'lively' to the death after the auction."

In the cultivation world, there was an unwritten rule: the more and better the treasures at an auction, the more and stronger the bandit cultivators it would attract.

---

The reason for this phenomenon was simple: wealth stirs greed. It could turn even auction attendees into opportunistic bandits, donning masks to rob others.

There had even been cases where consignors with weak cultivation but valuable treasures were betrayed by the auction organizers themselves, who turned to plundering.

After all, in a world without divine oversight, hellish retribution, or karmic justice, the saying held true: "Killing and arson earn golden belts, while bridge-building and road-mending leave unburied corpses."

"Sleep well tonight. Tomorrow, we'll explore this place thoroughly—there should be plenty of interesting things to see," Wei Qian said.

As cultivators, controlling their mental state was effortless. Insomnia was impossible, and they quickly fell into deep slumber.

Yet even in sleep, Wei Qian maintained a sliver of vigilance, ready to wake at the slightest disturbance.

The next day, the Li family rose early.

The Li family ancestor had acquired some spoils during the demonic cultivator suppression operation, which were to be auctioned off. This task fell to Li Wanhai.

Additionally, the Li family had brought their own spiritual herbs, teas, and grains to sell.

Where there were people, there was commerce—and the Li family wasn't the only one with this idea.

Around the auction hall, makeshift stalls had sprung up spontaneously.

"Wow, there are so many rogue cultivators here," Li Guchen marveled.

Compared to the small-scale trade fair the Li family had hosted earlier, this was on another level.

The gathering had drawn over two thousand cultivators—practically every rogue cultivator within a three-thousand-mile radius.

"Treasure maps from ancient cultivator caves here!"

"Mysterious broken bell—possible magic treasure fragment!"

"Mutant spirit beasts—just five spirit stones each!"

Stall owners shouted energetically to attract customers.

"Brother Qian, are any of these things real?" Li Guchen asked, wide-eyed with curiosity.

Wei Qian sighed. "Do you think actual treasures would end up in the hands of rogue cultivators like this?"

If rogue cultivators truly obtained valuable treasures, they would keep them secret, fearing theft or murder.

They certainly wouldn't flaunt them like this.

Of course, some were blinded by greed and lost considerable spirit stones as a result.

At that moment, an elderly cultivator with white hair and beard was clutching a bronze cauldron, seeking an appraiser's opinion.

The result, however, was not what he hoped for.

His flushed face and furious sputtering made that clear: "Look closely—examine the restrictions, the spiritual glow!"

"Fake. All fabricated," the appraiser said helplessly.

"Nonsense! These are ancient restrictions, a treasure cauldron forged by ancient cultivators. How could modern fakes replicate them?"

Watching the old cultivator's reddening face, Li Guchen shook his head. "I think I'll stay away from these types."

Moving past the outer stalls to the inner area, whether or not there were good items, there were certainly genuine ones.

"Talismans, elixirs, magical artifacts..." Wei Qian surveyed them one by one.

Many caught his interest.

For instance, a bottle of "Yuan-Increasing Pills"—even diluted in water, their potency would suffice for him to break through to the third layer of Qi Refining and enter the mid-stage.

Or a mid-grade magical artifact, the "Veiled Light Needle," which had mutated during forging, granting it three breaths of optical concealment—perfect for ambushes and sneak attacks.

But these items cost dozens or even hundreds of spirit stones, far beyond Wei Qian's means.

Of course, given that he possessed the wish-enhanced "Death's Door Nail" artifact, a risky gamble might secure these treasures.

"But I won't do that," Wei Qian firmly rejected the impulsive thought, crushing it.

He wasn't a deranged bandit. He wouldn't resort to such methods unprovoked.

He wouldn't attack unless attacked first.

But the saying had a second half: if provoked, he would retaliate fiercely.

Anyone who crossed him would face his wrath.
