**Chapter 5: The Alchemic Cauldron**

"If only I had a flying magic tool."

The market wasn't close to where he was. Walking all the way there took a considerable amount of effort. Looking at the spirit boats and flying swords occasionally soaring through the sky, his envy was indescribable. After trudging through mud and water, Zhang Yan finally arrived at the sect's market. From a distance, it looked like a huge plaza.

The plaza was filled with disciples setting up stalls, each with different items. There were no shops here; it was all trade between disciples. This was actually easy to understand. Within the sect, some valuable items were mostly exchanged using contribution points. The items exchanged in the sect's market were mostly miscellaneous or second-hand goods, and generally, the prices weren't high.

Zhang Yan excitedly entered the plaza. All around him were cultivators coming and going, some exuding spiritual light and precious aura, looking quite extraordinary. However, most still wore ordinary Daoist robes.

"So many!" Zhang Yan looked around. His main goal was some magic tools. However, for some unknown reason, not many people sold magic tools in the sect. He walked several laps and only found one place selling magic tools. Unfortunately, they were all new magic tools, which didn't meet his requirements at all.

Becoming an alchemist required not only talent but also a massive accumulation of resources. It was incredibly difficult. Among ten thousand cultivators, not even one might emerge as an alchemist. However!!! Zhang Yan only needed to equip that Wood Elemental Alchemic Cauldron to become an alchemist! Once he became an alchemist, he could casually refine a few pills and make a fortune!

Suppressing his slightly trembling body, he feigned nonchalance and walked up to the black-faced big man.

"Excuse me, Senior Brother, how much for this alchemic cauldron?" Zhang Yan asked, pointing at it.

"Wood Elemental Alchemic Cauldron, a mid-grade magic tool, priced at 110 spirit stones," the black-faced big man replied, his tone flat. After speaking, he closed his eyes again.

"110 spirit stones?" Zhang Yan shamelessly began to haggle. "That's too expensive! This cauldron is already so broken; it's hard to say if it even works, and you still want so much! Make it cheaper, make it cheaper and I'll take it!"

The black-faced big man heard this. He opened his eyes, looked carefully at Zhang Yan again, and then said, "How about this, 100 spirit stones!"

"My price is 50. If it works, fine; if not, then forget it!"

"50 spirit stones, give me 45 contribution points instead," the black-faced big man offered. Sect disciples all favored contribution points, as the sect's treasure vault contained many valuable items unobtainable elsewhere, and all of these required contribution points. But if you wanted to exchange spirit stones for contribution points, that was much more difficult.

"In that case, many thanks, Senior Brother!" Zhang Yan took out his jade token. He gently touched it against the other party's jade token, completing the transaction.

"Alright, this mid-grade magic tool is yours now," the black-faced big man said generously, pointing at the Wood Elemental Alchemic Cauldron.

Zhang Yan picked up the Wood Elemental Alchemic Cauldron and examined it carefully. This Wood Elemental Alchemic Cauldron was exquisitely crafted and heavy in hand, definitely a good magic tool. Although its entire body was covered in cracks, it didn't matter. Zhang Yan didn't care at all. Anyway, he wanted this Wood Elemental Alchemic Cauldron not because it was a magic tool, but because of… alchemical experience! Specifically, the "Minor Achievement in Alchemy" and "Mastery of Fire Control" perks. For him, the quality of the magic tool was irrelevant; the perks within it were what truly mattered!

The two completed their transaction, and both felt they hadn't lost out.
