# Chapter 4: Backing Down  

Qin Chong first discovered the Eight Trigram Mirror in his previous life. He remembered buying it from a roadside stall after hearing it could ward off evil spirits, so he hung it on his bedroom door.  

That night, he fell into a deep sleep and never woke up—until he found himself here.  

At that time, Qin Chong was only twelve or thirteen years old and had just begun cultivating for a year. Blessed with fire, wood, and earth spiritual roots, he was highly regarded by his family and reached the third layer of Qi Refining within a short time.  

But after his arrival, his cultivation stagnated for years, gradually causing his family to lose interest in him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been sent to train in the remote Cangshan Mountains.  

Qin Chong’s father was the head of the Qin Clan, a cultivator at the early Foundation Establishment stage. As for his mother, he had never met her—she was said to have perished during a training expedition when he was young.  

The entire Qin Clan had only about a dozen cultivators, with just two at the Foundation Establishment stage. The other was a distant uncle Qin Chong had rarely seen, rumored to be in seclusion, attempting to break through to the mid-stage.  

The rest included two uncles, four or five cousins, and a few rogue cultivators recruited as guest elders.  

Such strength was insignificant in the vast world of cultivation, but to Qin Chong, this was his home. Despite the cold treatment in recent years, it still meant everything to him.  

The old man took the Eight Trigram Mirror, examined it briefly, then waved his hand again—this time retrieving the Yin-Yang fish pendant from the skeleton. With a series of hand seals, the two objects merged into one.  

A moment later, the mirror erupted with an unprecedented radiance, forcing Qin Chong to shut his eyes.  

When he opened them again, the old man, the skeleton, and even the mirror had vanished. The stone chamber was empty, leaving only Qin Chong behind.  

*What just happened? No explanation at all?*  

Suddenly, he realized his spiritual energy had silently returned to its peak—no, it felt even more abundant than before!  

He quickly circulated his cultivation technique and was stunned to find his realm had leaped two levels, reaching the fifth layer of Qi Refining. The surprise was almost too sudden.  

But the greater shock was discovering the Eight Trigram Mirror had returned to his dantian, floating there silently, unchanged in appearance.  

Eager to study it further, Qin Chong tried summoning the mirror, but as before, it refused to budge. Frustrated, he could only inspect it through internal vision.  

---  

Indeed, what he had seen earlier was real—the back of the mirror now bore an embedded Yin-Yang fish.  

*Was that all?*  

Unwilling to give up, Qin Chong repeatedly probed the mirror with his divine sense. After numerous attempts, when he focused entirely on the mirror’s center, a sudden transformation occurred.  

His consciousness was pulled into an unknown space—small, spanning only a few dozen zhang, but vastly larger than his three-zhang storage pouch.  

Excitement surged through him. Spatial treasures were exceedingly rare in the cultivation world.  

Upon closer inspection, Qin Chong noticed the skeleton from the stone chamber had been relocated here, seated atop a patch of faint golden soil unlike the rest of the space.  

Though he didn’t recognize the soil’s origin, he dared not disturb the remains left by the mysterious elder.  

After observing for a while, his consciousness withdrew from the mirror’s space.  

Next, he tested transferring items from his storage pouch into the mirror’s dimension—success! With a mere thought, objects could move freely in and out.  

This function alone made it a priceless treasure.  

Storing valuables here was far safer. Qin Chong estimated that ordinary cultivators would never detect the mirror’s presence within him.  

Whether greater experts could sense it, he wasn’t sure—but he doubted he’d ever cross paths with such beings.  

Though his cultivation had stagnated in recent years, his knowledge and experience had grown exponentially. As a modern man, he understood the importance of knowledge—power in any world.  

He had devoured countless texts and jade slips, his near-photographic memory accelerating his learning.  

The only mystery left was the golden soil.  

Testing various items on it, he concluded it could enhance the spiritual energy of spirit stones and purify ores.  

To verify, he placed a low-grade spirit stone on the soil. Though its energy increased, the process was painstakingly slow.  

---  

After some thought, Qin Chong decided to infuse it with his own spiritual energy.  

The result left him stunned.  

A single attempt drained nearly all his energy, yet the stone advanced to mid-grade!  

Overjoyed, he resolved to leave the cave.  

He stored the Blood Spirit Fruit and spirit stones in the mirror’s space, keeping only mundane items and his Flying Dragon Sword in his pouch. But before departing, he needed to recover his energy—someone was still waiting outside.  

Even at the fifth layer of Qi Refining, his opponent wielded a mid-grade magical weapon and possibly other tricks. A direct confrontation was unwise.  

*Eliminating him is necessary. If he learns of my sudden advancement, the consequences could be dire.*  

The proverb echoed in his mind: *The innocent man is guilty of possessing a treasure.*  

The Eight Trigram Mirror must remain secret—no traces could be left.  

Hours later, Qin Chong had mostly recovered. Suppressing his aura back to the third layer, he crawled out through the cave’s exit.  

The once-overwhelming suction force was gone, making his ascent far easier.  

Moments later, he surfaced, panting heavily, his face pale and exhausted.  

Lying in the shallow water, he looked up to see the waiting cultivator smirking at him, slowly approaching with his weapon hovering before him.  

"Impressive endurance, staying underwater for hours," the man remarked, his tone mocking.  

"Wait!" Qin Chong gasped weakly. "I’ll give you the Blood Spirit Fruit—just spare my life. You can even take my storage pouch."
