**Chapter 174: Re-entering the Secret Realm**  

"Imperial Brother, I've arrived. Please grant me an audience."  

Within a grand palace, a man draped in a dark golden robe embroidered with nine dragons slowly opened his eyes. His gaze settled on Ji Julin standing outside the door, and he spoke in a composed tone.  

"Many thanks, Imperial Brother."  

Ji Julin responded with deference before stepping inside and seating himself on a nearby cushion.  

"Imperial Brother, what brings you here today?"  

The man across from him wasted no time with pleasantries, cutting straight to the point. He knew his younger brother well—if Ji Julin had sought him out, it was undoubtedly for something important.  

Seated on the cushion, Ji Julin's expression turned solemn.  

"During my recent attendance at the Dao Tea Gathering of the Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect, I encountered two individuals who may prove to be formidable rivals for Imperial Brother in the contest for the top position in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm's Foundation Establishment tier."  

"The Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect?"  

A flicker of curiosity passed over the man's face.  

"Isn't Ge Qingshen their strongest Foundation Establishment disciple participating in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm? According to the Dao Court's assessment, his combat prowess barely reaches the seventh tier of Foundation Establishment. Who else could possibly be noteworthy?"  

Ji Julin's eyes darkened with gravity.  

"I would never dare deceive Imperial Brother."  

"One is named Zhang Jing, the other Qu Junhou. I witnessed their strength firsthand—both possess terrifying power, firmly within the eighth tier of Foundation Establishment. Should Imperial Brother encounter them in the secret realm, utmost caution is advised."  

"Understood. I appreciate the warning."  

The man smiled faintly.  

Before long, Ji Julin departed, leaving the palace behind. The man's expression returned to its usual indifference, as if his brother's words had already been dismissed.  

"An opponent at the eighth tier of Foundation Establishment? If this were before, I might have needed to take them seriously. But now..."  

His eyes gleamed with hidden depths as he raised his head slightly, his gaze piercing through layers of obstruction to fix upon a mysterious woman in the distance.  

"The Moon Jade Rabbit lineage—one of the Thirty-Six Noble Bloodlines of the Myriad Heavens, a race born with the innate power of the Lunar Essence. To think an immature member of their kind would participate in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm."  

"Perfect. This will be an opportunity to test whether my ninth-tier Foundation Establishment strength can surpass that of a Moon Jade Rabbit."  

In truth, ever since breaking through to the ninth tier and learning of the Moon Jade Rabbit's presence in the secret realm, the man had already shifted his focus.  

His true rival was no longer among the human prodigies—it was that celestial beast.  

---  

Meanwhile, back in his own palace, Zhang Jing sat cross-legged in meditation.  

Suddenly, as if recalling something, he produced a seed shimmering with seven-colored radiance. As his divine sense brushed over it, he detected the vibrant vitality of seven distinct elemental forces intertwined within.  

"The Seven Treasures Gourd Vine... Truly worthy of its name. The seed actually contains seven different elemental attributes."  

A peculiar thought crossed his mind.  

"Wait... If I plant this, will it grow seven gourds, and then..."  

A strange expression flickered across his face before he shook his head.  

"Never mind. I'll leave this headache for Lu Thirty-Eight. That guy might even enjoy the challenge."  

A faint smile touched his lips as he stored the seed away and closed his eyes once more, his aura gradually settling into deep tranquility.  

---  

Time flowed steadily onward, and soon, the day arrived for the Proud Cloud Secret Realm's second phase to commence.  

The atmosphere in Proud Cloud Immortal City had grown increasingly fervent, especially around the Dueling Immortal Platform, which had scarcely known a moment of silence.  

The reason?  

Several formidable beings from the Myriad Heavens faction—seemingly emerging out of thin air—had been relentlessly challenging the elite geniuses of the top immortal lineages, much like the Golden-Winged Roc had done earlier.  

Through these clashes, the ordinary cultivators in the city came to realize that many hidden talents had deliberately held back during the first phase.  

Names like Ji Julin of the Human Emperor Dao Court and Wang Wunian of the Primordial Demon Sect began circulating through the streets.  

Conversely, the powerful races of the Myriad Heavens—such as the Golden-Winged Roc, the Water-Avoiding Deer, and the Mountain-Bearing Ram Demon—also became widely recognized.  

Among these battles, none were more discussed than Qu Junhou's duel with the Golden-Winged Roc.  

Not only was the fight thrilling from start to finish, leaving spectators in awe, but it was also seen as the spark that ignited the fierce rivalry between the human elites and the Myriad Heavens faction.  

A clash of monumental significance.  

Yet all of this was irrelevant to Zhang Jing.  

Since returning from the Dao Tea Gathering, he had remained secluded in his palace, quietly cultivating as he awaited the second phase.  

Qu Junhou, on the other hand, had grown restless. In the following days, he seized the opportunity to face the Water-Avoiding Deer on the Dueling Immortal Platform, further cementing his reputation as the "Earth-Sundering Bright King."  

He was now hailed as one of the "Ten Elite Foundation Establishment Talents of Humanity," basking in unparalleled glory.  

---  

On this day, within his palace, Zhang Jing abruptly opened his eyes, their glow illuminating the dim chamber.  

At the same moment...  

In another palace, the man clad in the dark golden nine-dragon robe slowly lifted his head, divine light radiating from his body.  

In a secluded cave abode, a veiled woman rose from her jade bed, her bare feet hovering half an inch above the ground. The silver bells adorning her ankles chimed softly, accentuating the ethereal beauty of her porcelain skin.  

"It's time!"  

Gentle, domineering, and crisp voices echoed simultaneously in different locations.  

---  

Strands of resplendent immortal light spread rapidly across the thousand-zhang-tall stone gate of the secret realm, enveloping it entirely in an instant.  

A terrifying spatial ripple swept outward.  

In the blink of an eye, beams of light shot into the sky from every corner of the city, streaking toward the stone gate.  

Before long, the square before the gate was packed with 110,000 Foundation Establishment cultivators—all survivors of the first phase.  

Every face was solemn, every gaze fixed intently on the gate in absolute silence.  

Then, after what felt like an eternity...  

Boom—  

A thunderous roar, distant yet distinct, reverberated through the air.  

The scenery beyond the gate gradually came into view.  

Without hesitation, figures surged forward—some eager, some confident, some uneasy—all stepping into the now-open Proud Cloud Secret Realm.  

In mere moments, the square was emptied.  

---  

Inside the secret realm, Zhang Jing glanced around and immediately noticed something peculiar.  

The gazes of those around him seemed to converge on a few specific individuals, and within those looks lingered a trace of reverence.  

"What's going on?"  

Curious, he followed their line of sight.  

His eyes soon landed on ten figures scattered throughout the crowd, including Qu Junhou and Ji Julin.  

Fragments of hushed conversations reached his ears.  

After listening carefully, a playful smile tugged at his lips.  

"The Ten Elite Foundation Establishment Talents of Humanity? So Qu Junhou and the others have been quite busy these past few days. Interesting."  

As he pondered, the sky abruptly darkened.  

"It's here!"  

Zhang Jing snapped back to attention, his gaze lifting toward the heavens.  

A colossal face materialized across the firmament, its eyes closed and expressionless.  

Then, slowly, those eyes opened, sweeping a heavy gaze over the crowd below.  

A majestic voice boomed forth.  

"The second phase begins now!"  

"Listen well to the rules."  

As the voice of the secret realm's spirit rang out, a shadowy outline emerged in the depths of the sky—an island, faintly visible, from which dazzling immortal light pulsed.  

The crowd stared in fascination.  

"As you can see, that is an immortal island high in the sky. I have named it the Isle of Heroes. This phase is directly related to it."  

A brief pause.  

At that moment, countless odd glances flickered toward Qu Junhou and the other nine.  

Among the crowd, Zhang Jing couldn't help but chuckle.  

He had clearly seen the flicker of embarrassment on Qu Junhou's face the moment the island's name was announced.  

But the moment passed quickly as attention returned to the secret realm's spirit.  

"The rules are simple."  

"The Isle of Heroes lies 100,000 zhang above."  

"Within ten days, the first 10,000 to reach the island will advance to the next phase. The rest will be eliminated."  

"The second phase starts now!"  

With that, the colossal face faded from the sky.  

Silence descended once more.  

Zhang Jing withdrew his gaze, his mind working.  

"100,000 zhang... For cultivators at our level, that height is trivial. Reaching it in mere moments might be an exaggeration, but a few dozen breaths should suffice."  

"Yet..."  

"The secret realm's spirit gave us ten whole days."  

His eyes narrowed as he studied the pristine blue sky and the indistinct outline of the so-called Isle of Heroes.  

What trials or traps lay hidden along the way?  

As for the limit of 10,000 spots, Zhang Jing wasn't concerned.  

It was unlikely that 10,000 people would reach the island before he did.  

Just then—  

"Hahaha! Ascending to an island? This challenge was made for me!"  

A loud laugh shattered the silence.  

Zhang Jing turned to see the Golden-Winged Roc from before spread its wings and shoot skyward like a golden streak, its once-shattered feathers now fully restored and gleaming with indestructible brilliance.  

A spark of amusement lit Zhang Jing's eyes.  

Perfect timing.  

He had just been wondering about potential obstacles when this bird volunteered to test the waters.  

All around, others who shared his thoughts locked their gazes onto the Golden-Winged Roc, watching intently.
