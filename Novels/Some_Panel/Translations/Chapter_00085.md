# Chapter 84: Jun Ye's Appreciation and Opportunity

According to the records, he got along extremely well with all the male disciples in the sect. If he was in a good mood and found you agreeable, regardless of your status, he would bring out aged fine wine and chat merrily with you. He was the most down-to-earth Mahayana cultivator in the sect. The book also stated that he was known as the "Saint of Love," once claiming he needed to smell a million flowers in the world before he could turn back and ascend to immortality. Yet, to this day, he had still not found a single Dao Companion. Truly, his destiny in love had not arrived.

Yang Ji found it amusing and couldn't help but respond, "There are fragrant grasses everywhere in the world; why fixate on a single flower? Elder, please don't be sad."

"Yes, yes, I've lost my composure, lost my composure," Jun Ye shook his head dejectedly, then suddenly looked up and asked, "Hmm? Which disciple are you?"

"Disciple Yang Ji, here to receive cultivation techniques," Yang Ji and the others respectfully bowed.

"Oh! Come, come, sit down first, sit down first."

As a True Inheritance Elder, Jun Ye was utterly without pretense, gentle as jade, possessing the elegance of a scholar and the carefree spirit of a wanderer. With a pot of wine in hand, he got along with every male disciple in the sect, and many were familiar with his temperament. It was Yang Ji's first time meeting him, and he couldn't resist his enthusiasm, yet he still dared not overstep, respectfully saying, "This disciple can just stand."

"You, disciple, you're new, aren't you? If I tell you to sit, then sit."

Jun Ye smiled, boldly pulling Yang Ji down to sit. Then he took out an exquisite wine cup, filled it with fine wine, and slowly offered it to Yang Ji, "This is Peach Blossom Wine. Drinking a cup can strengthen your body and also help you find your destined partner."

Find his destined partner? Yang Ji hesitated at the words, somewhat afraid to drink it, because the person before him was known as the Saint of Love, yet after all these years, he hadn't found a single Dao Companion. If he drank his wine, he feared...

"What? Afraid?" Jun Ye looked at him with a smile and said, "My Dao is different from yours. Go ahead and drink; don't be afraid. I wouldn't trick my own disciples, would I?" Jun Ye's smile turned to sadness as he finished speaking, then picked up his own wine cup and drained it in one gulp.

"Then I shall try Elder's wine of destiny," Yang Ji said, hesitatingly picking up the cup and drinking it down.

"I see you have a good appearance, at least seven parts as handsome as me. Don't waste your good looks! Those Saintesses from the Grand Beginning Dao Sect, Longevity Dao Sect, Immortal One Dao Sect, and Pure Yang Dao Sect are all incredibly delicate. With your looks, you should bring back at least three to make it worth it and add some color to our sect." Jun Ye refilled his cup while praising him. "Oh? Right, I heard that child Xuan Zhong found a Saintess from the Pure Yang Dao Sect. He's living quite the free and easy life. You're not bad either; you should try hard to find one to strengthen our sect."

Yang Ji, while fearfully raising his cup, humbly replied, "Elder, you jest. Senior Brother Xuan Zhong is one of the ten Dao Sons of our sect, with unmatched talent and extraordinary strength. How could I dare compare myself to him?"

"Hmm, you're right! As an outer sect disciple, it seems you can't compare to Xuan Zhong in anything other than your looks." Jun Ye took another gulp of wine. "That child Xuan Zhong is indeed outstanding. At such a young age, he's already reached the Body Fusion stage. Aside from being a bit rougher in appearance than us, he's practically flawless! He's truly a blessing to the sect." He then seemed to recall something and said, "Oh, right, why are you all here at the Dao Pagoda?"

"Elder, I passed the first assessment and came to comprehend a cultivation technique," Yang Ji replied.

"Oh? You passed the first assessment? Then I must congratulate you! You're one step closer to staying in the Dao Sect forever. We must celebrate this! Come, let's toast." Jun Ye refilled their cups, and they drank another round. Only then did he look at Yang Ji and say, "Hmm, I still need to see your Dao Sect tokens to confirm."

"Elder, here are the Dao Sect tokens," Yang Ji and the others all took out their tokens and respectfully handed them forward.

Elder Jun Ye first took Yang Ji's token. After a glance, a flicker of surprise flashed in his eyes, and he then chuckled with great interest, "You're quite a disciple! To be able to swat even a demon sect Dao Son's clone to death, remarkable, truly remarkable! You're even more valiant than I was back in my day."

"Elder, you jest. How could this disciple dare compare himself to you?" Yang Ji humbly said.

"Don't be modest. Someone who can kill a Dao Son's clone is no ordinary person." Elder Jun Ye looked at him with an affirming gaze, sizing him up approvingly, then looked back at the token. He clicked his tongue in praise, "Return-to-Hidden Sword Art, four stances complete. Universal Shift, complete. Your comprehension, disciple, is quite good! No wonder you could swat a demon sect Dao Son's clone to death. Excellent, excellent."

However, as he looked, Elder Jun Ye suddenly frowned and looked up at Yang Ji, "You only have mid-grade root bone?"

"Yes, Elder, this disciple only has mid-grade root bone," Yang Ji answered truthfully.

Jun Ye gulped down a mouthful of wine, then immediately let out a long sigh, "Truly, Heaven envies talent! This Heaven doesn't want our sect to prosper. Just when we finally get a genius with good comprehension, this wretched Heaven has to cut down his root bone."

"Perhaps this is Heaven's tempering for me," Yang Ji smiled calmly.

"Hmm, your mentality, disciple, is quite good. Only through tempering can one become a true immortal. This might not be a bad thing. Only by experiencing the bitterness of the depths can one inquire about immortality at the peak. Excellent." Jun Ye glanced at him. "I see you cultivate our sect's high-grade Dao-level cultivation technique, the True Adamant Divine Art. This art has a total of eight volumes. You've passed the first assessment, so you're eligible to choose one volume to take. Are you here to collect the fourth volume of this technique?"

"Precisely. This disciple has already reached the peak of the Golden Core stage and needs the fourth volume of the technique to condense the Heavenly and Earthly Dharmic Manifestation and break through to the Nascent Soul stage," Yang Ji said.

"Very well. This True Adamant Divine Art is one of the sect's ten high-grade Dao-level cultivation techniques. Its power is formidable, second only to the sect's supreme Dao-level technique, the 'Limitless Immortal Scripture.' With your comprehension, cultivating this technique is quite suitable." Elder Jun Ye flipped his palm, and with a flash of spiritual light, two jade slips appeared in his hand. "Here are the fourth and fifth volumes of the True Adamant Divine Art, enough for you to cultivate all the way to the Void Refining stage. Take them both."

Jun Ye handed over the jade slips, his expression suddenly becoming solemn as he earnestly warned, "But don't go spreading this around. I'm giving you an extra volume, which is breaking sect rules, and I don't want any rumors to spread because of it." As he spoke, he looked deeply at Yang Ji and sighed, "Ah, for someone like me who adheres to rules, to make an exception for you, it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be. I suppose it's because we are both equally handsome and our auras resonate. Let's not make an example of this, let's not make an example!"

"Many thanks, Elder!" Yang Ji's heart swelled with joy. He stood up and bowed deeply. How could he not know that the Elder was opening a back door for him?

"Hmm." Jun Ye nodded. After handing out the jade slips, he looked at Chong Yuan and the others, "What level of cultivation technique do you all want? Regardless of the level, you can each choose one volume to take."

"Elder, we can just choose a low-grade Dao-level cultivation technique," Chong Yuan and the others exchanged glances and said. While high-grade Dao-level techniques were good, they would be useless if they couldn't comprehend them.

"Good, here are all the low-grade Dao-level cultivation techniques; you may choose." Jun Ye swiped his palm through the air, and instantly a light screen appeared, displaying the names of dozens of low-grade Dao-level cultivation techniques with detailed descriptions. Chong Yuan and the others looked, and before long, they all made their choices.

Once the techniques were chosen, Yang Ji and the others bowed and prepared to exit the hall. Just then, Jun Ye looked at Yang Ji and suddenly spoke, "Oh, right, seeing you reminded me of something. Back when I was in the Nascent Soul stage, while tempering myself in the sect's Hell Forging Ground, I once discovered a Purple Sun Sacred Tree. This Purple Sun Sacred Tree blossoms every hundred years, bears fruit every hundred years, and matures every hundred years. The Purple Sun Fruits it bears have the effect of improving one's root bone. Back when I discovered it, the sacred tree hadn't even blossomed yet, and later I just forgot about it. I'll give you a map guide. You can go take a look. If you're lucky enough to find a few Purple Sun Fruits, then your root bone can be slightly improved."

As he spoke, he pointed a finger at Yang Ji's glabella, imprinting a rough map into his mind. Such an opportunity filled Yang Ji with overjoyed excitement. He immediately bowed and said, "Many thanks, Elder!"

"Hmm, no need to thank me. Go ahead. If you can find it, it's your opportunity. Purple Sun Fruits are of no use to me, so I didn't pay much attention to them back then," Jun Ye smiled slightly.

Yang Ji calmed his emotions, bowed once more, and then exited the Dao Pagoda with Chong Yuan and the others. Seeing Yang Ji and the others walk out of the Dao Pagoda, a voice suddenly came from above the Dao Pagoda, resounding in Jun Ye's ear.

"So many years have passed, I wonder if that Purple Sun Tree is still there?"

"I don't know either. If it is, then it's his luck," Jun Ye smiled slightly. "This disciple has good comprehension. I suppose this counts as giving him some benefits. He has potential, and his mentality is good. If he gets a bit more luck, then becoming a True Inheritance disciple isn't impossible."

"With such comprehension, he indeed has a chance to become a True Inheritance disciple, but he still needs much more tempering. Before becoming a True Inheritance disciple, it's his critical period for breaking free from the cocoon and becoming a butterfly. His character, cultivation direction, karma, luck, and so on are all growing and converging. We shouldn't interfere too much. If he can overcome these challenges and achieve True Inheritance, then the sect's resources will be fully open to him, and raising his root bone to peak-grade will be an easy matter." Another voice came from above the Dao Pagoda.

"Indeed, without becoming a True Inheritance disciple, everything requires personal effort. However, aren't the resources enjoyed after becoming a True Inheritance disciple also the result of effort?" Jun Ye smiled.
