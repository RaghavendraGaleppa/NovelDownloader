Chapter 49: Obtaining Tiger Saliva Stone, Killing the Ghost-Striped Beast

Li Xian fired another "Lingyu Arrow."

Tiger blood flowed everywhere. Seeing that there was absolutely no chance of survival, he approached to check.

The great beast was enormous, its lower abdomen slightly swollen—it was a pregnant female tiger.

"I wonder if this counts as one tiger or two."

The tiger's blood was too pungent to drink directly, so Li Xian put the carcass away.

With this, not even a full day had passed, and he had already hunted one tiger and one deer. The harvest was truly abundant.

"Is it that I am particularly lucky, or are there simply too many tigers in this area?"

"When hunting with Father in the past, tracking a great tiger for over ten days was considered quick."

Li Xian let out a soft breath.

The tiger and deer weighed several hundred catties combined, but once placed inside the shrinking meat bag, they felt as light as nothing.

It did not hinder his movement at all. If he had such a treasure in the past, hunting in the mountains would have been much easier.

Li Xian hung the shrinking meat bag at his waist and tied it securely with a rope. Suddenly, an idea struck him. Generally speaking, a mountain cannot support two tigers, but this Bear and Tiger Mountain was clearly a gathering place for fierce beasts.

Since this great tiger had a fetus, finding the tiger's den might yield an unexpected harvest.

He followed the tracks, gradually moving away from the river.

Arriving halfway up the mountain, he smelled a foul stench. Li Xian became even more certain that the tiger's den was nearby.

Tigers are territorial beasts. This urine scent is a marker. Since he had already entered the tiger's territory, he had to be extremely cautious, lightening his footsteps and listening carefully to his surroundings.

"Found it."

He discovered a cave and lay on the ground to listen for a moment.

The sound of a tiger snoring was like thunder, extremely obvious. If Li Xian heard no movement, it would mean the cave was empty.

He entered the cave to investigate, moving deeper inside. The tiger's den was foul, with white bones visible here and there.

"Wow... did this mountain tiger eat many people?"

Li Xian felt a sudden chill. Then, he saw a glimmer of light ahead and discovered a glowing stone.

He held it in his hand; it was very warm.

"Tiger Saliva Stone, a precious mountain treasure!"

Li Xian was overjoyed. Of course, the word "precious" was only relative to common families.

This type of stone is licked daily by mountain tigers, worn smooth and round by the barbs on their tongues. It is a supreme Yang object. Legend has it that soaking this object in water and drinking it can strengthen the body. It can also keep out the cold in winter.

This thing was very useful to Li Xian.

Holding it in his hand, the texture was like jade, slightly heavy.

"There must be another tiger in this den."

"If I take this thing, it will definitely come looking for me."

"Hmph, let it come. I might as well fight it."

Li Xian put away the Tiger Saliva Stone and quickly left the cave. He looked around, searching for suitable terrain.

Tigers have a keen sense of smell for the scent of Tiger Saliva Stones. Even if Li Xian threw the stone away, he would already carry the scent on his body. The tiger would still find him.

About half an hour later.

A tiger's roar suddenly echoed through the forest. Li Xian knew the male tiger had returned to its den.

"This roar... it sounds like muffled thunder, rolling in. This male tiger is probably even more formidable."

Li Xian's expression turned grave.

It didn't take long.

The sound of branches snapping came from the distance. Li Xian looked over and saw a raised tiger back.

"This is..."

Li Xian's whole body tensed up.

He came from a background of hunting and was extremely familiar with the habits, patterns, and physique of tiger beasts.

This mountain tiger's patterns were very strange; it likely wasn't a tiger, but a *Biao* (a fierce hybrid beast)! Specifically, a "Ghost-Striped Biao," feared by all who saw it.

This wild beast was shaped like a tiger but larger. The patterns on its body looked like ghostly faces. It was notoriously fierce.

Provoking it... led to only one outcome: a fight to the death, either you die or I die!

Even if you fled a thousand miles, it would follow your scent and track you down relentlessly.

"Roar!"

The roar sounded suddenly. The Ghost-Striped Biao leaped, its full form revealed in Li Xian's vision.

It was truly fierce. The aura of the King of Beasts seemed to suppress humans instinctively.

Li Xian's hair stood on end. He forced himself to remain calm and immediately drew an arrow to shoot.

The Ghost-Striped Biao's eyes flashed with a sharp light. Its hind legs pushed off a large tree, shifting to the left to dodge the arrow. Then, it actually moved along the tree like a gibbon, looking down at Li Xian from above.

"What a smart beast!"

Li Xian shot three more arrows, all easily dodged by the Ghost-Striped Biao. The beast suddenly let out a shake of its roar, kicked its legs, and dove down from high up.

Li Xian's thoughts raced. If he dodged backward now, the Ghost-Striped Biao would land and use the momentum to lunge forward, making it impossible to defend against. It was better to dive forward and slip under the beast's belly.

This would give him more room to react.

In a flash of thought, Li Xian made his decision. He leaned forward and dove, narrowly passing under the Ghost-Striped Biao's lower abdomen. At the same time, he pushed off the ground with his hands and, in the midst of the chaos, kicked the Ghost-Striped Biao's belly with one foot.

[Clear Wind Leg]
[Proficiency: 719/1000 Mastery]

The force of the Clear Wind Leg goes from the surface to the interior. It looks light and飘忽 (ethereal), but actually damages the internal organs.

Against such a thick-skinned wild beast, it had an unexpected effect.

The Ghost-Striped Biao let out a howl, becoming even more furious. It wanted to turn around and bite immediately, but its previous momentum had been too strong. It slid several zhang across the ground before barely stopping.

As it turned to pounce...

It didn't know that this action was also within Li Xian's calculations.

At this time, Li Xian had already created distance. He slowed his breathing, sharpened his five senses, and quickly shot two arrows.

"噗哧..." (Splat...)

Blood splattered.

One arrow pierced the Ghost-Striped Biao's left eye. However, what terrified Li Xian was that the beast was only blinded, not dead.

"What a tough body!"

Li Xian took off running.

The Ghost-Striped Biao, driven by bloodlust, felt no pain. At that moment, its eyes were only on Li Xian. Its tiger body charged wildly.

*Bang!*

It撞 (collided) with a large tree, knocking it over with its immense force.

"Man, that is fierce."

Li Xian ran toward a spot and suddenly leaped into the air.

The Ghost-Striped Biao followed, flying after him.

Suddenly, both the human and the beast felt their feet go empty. This place was actually a cliff about ten zhang high.

不知何时 (Somehow), a vine was wrapped around Li Xian's ankle. He pulled hard now, using it to cancel his momentum and stop his fall. He hung upside down on the cliff face.

The Ghost-Striped Biao, however, fell straight down the cliff. With a *bang*, its eye sockets burst and waste flowed out.

But this creature's vitality was terrifyingly tenacious.

Falling from that height, it still wasn't dead and struggled to get up. Li Xian, hanging upside down from above, aimed for the heart...

He shot three arrows in succession, all hitting the same spot.

Finally, he broke through the skin.

He took out another Lingyu Arrow, aimed at the opening, channeled his Internal Qi, and shot.

The Ghost-Striped Biao finally died on the spot.

"What a terrifying wild beast."

Li Xian wiped away cold sweat.

Hunting in the mountains, utilizing the terrain is the most important thing. The human body is weak; only by using tools and strategy can one protect oneself in a forest surrounded by fierce beasts.

Li Xian had already planned how to deal with mountain tigers. Although it was more dangerous than he had imagined, it generally went according to plan.

"One deer, two tigers..."

"Three Lingyu Arrows. For the first day, the harvest is quite good."

Li Xian climbed down to the bottom of the cliff and packed up the Ghost-Striped Biao.

He calculated briefly...

He had used over thirty ordinary arrows.

"If I can maintain this kind of harvest, this trip will be incredibly profitable!"
