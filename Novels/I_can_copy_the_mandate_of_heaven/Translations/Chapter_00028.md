# Chapter 28: The Person Between the Cliffs

Li Zhiming wandered aimlessly through the mountains. At this moment, it seemed that only he and Han Li had the leisure to roam freely within the Seven Mystic Gate. He had gone to the bamboo forest behind the Broken Peak to catch cloud sparrows but returned empty-handed. As he was about to descend the mountain, Li Zhiming spotted a suspicious figure.

He hid behind a bush and observed carefully. His sharp eyes, a trait of being a young child, allowed him to discern that the figure was not a small beast but a person. The figure was climbing between the cliffs, shrouded in mist, resembling a black cloud sparrow. Li Zhiming's curiosity was piqued, and he watched intently.

From a distance, it was hard to tell that the figure was human. The person was small in stature, and their body was cut off at the waist, making it difficult to recognize them as a person. However, their outstretched hands and feet as they climbed the cliff were clearly visible. They were wearing black hemp-like clothing and had vines wrapped around their body, making them blend seamlessly into the environment. Even when they moved, it was easy to mistake them for a clump of vines on the cliff face. Li Zhiming's exceptional eyesight allowed him to notice the figure, but if a Seven Mystic Gate warrior were standing there, they might not have even noticed the person on the opposite cliff.

Before Li Zhiming could blink, the figure vanished. It turned out to be Jin Guang, a monk with a serious expression. He had wrapped vines around his body and attached a concealment talisman to himself, making him nearly invisible. After ensuring that he was alone, Jin Guang revealed his true appearance - a man with a repulsive face covered in flesh tumors. He smiled coldly, pulled out a map, and studied it carefully, occasionally glancing at the terrain of the Seven Mystic Gate.

"Ha! If the Sea Sand Sect doesn't give me enough benefits this time, I'll not let them off," Jin Guang muttered to himself. With a thought, he used a earth escape talisman and disappeared into the ground.

Meanwhile, Li Zhiming was still watching from a distance. "Strange..." he muttered, rubbing his eyes, wondering if he had seen things correctly. After confirming that the figure was indeed gone, he left the mountain.

Upon returning to the Medicine Valley entrance, Li Zhiming spotted Han Li again. Han Li was walking into the valley, his short stature and dark skin a familiar sight. Li Zhiming snuck up behind him, picked up a thick branch, and prepared to attack. However, his "Breaking" technique was not suited for stealth, and Han Li suddenly vanished from his sight.

Li Zhiming's attack missed, and he was caught off guard as Han Li appeared behind him and kicked him. Li Zhiming used his "Occupying the Ground" technique, but it was not enough to counter Han Li's attack. He stumbled back, and Han Li took the opportunity to pin him down.

The two engaged in a fierce fight, with Li Zhiming using his "Breaking" technique and Han Li countering with his own skills. Just as it seemed that Han Li was about to gain the upper hand, Li Zhiming managed to turn the tables and pin Han Li down. However, Han Li produced a branch and pressed it against Li Zhiming's throat.

"You'll die, Little Four," Han Li said coldly.

Li Zhiming's eyes widened, but he refused to back down. He tensed his neck muscles and collided with the branch, breaking it, and simultaneously head-butted Han Li. The two exchanged blows, but before things escalated further, they were interrupted by the arrival of Mo, the black-clad doctor with white hair and a stern expression.

Both Li Zhiming and Han Li immediately stood up straight, their heads bowed in respect.
