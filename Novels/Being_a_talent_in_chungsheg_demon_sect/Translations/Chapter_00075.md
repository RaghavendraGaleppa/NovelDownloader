# Chapter 75: The Destined Daughter, Yu Suzhen!

Yu Suzhen sighed, then rose from the boy whose vitality she had plundered, leaving him lifeless.

"Hehe... it's finally done!"

Feeling the true qi flowing within her, Yu Suzhen almost cried out. After enduring countless hardships in the Joyful Union Hall, she had finally broken through to the first layer of Qi Refining today.

After a brief loss of control, Yu Suzhen regained her composure. Her eyebrows relaxed, and her originally seductive face suddenly turned cool and detached. Her beautiful eyes revealed a newfound determination. They say youth easily fades and beauty withers, but she never wanted to see herself grow old.

"I want to cultivate immortality, I want eternal life!"

At this moment, Yu Suzhen's desire for cultivation was stronger than ever. She would ascend to the very top of the Primordial Saint Sect, step by step by step!

What she didn't realize was that there was a second person in the cave dwelling.

Beside the boy she had just drained, a translucent figure, invisible to mortal eyes, stood with hands clasped behind its back, watching her with keen interest.

"The Sky-Stealing Art, the first step is complete."

"Senior Sister Yu is quite good. She already has the ambition to cultivate, so I don't even need to deliberately stir it. Everything comes from her own heart."

This was for the best.

After all, Lu Yang was not yet at Foundation Establishment. He was far from the natural state of a Foundation Establishment True Person; deliberately influencing others' thoughts would too easily reveal flaws.

Immediately after, Lu Yang examined himself. His physical body was now dead, having entered the 'death and rebirth' state of the *True Lunar Metamorphosis Corpse Severance Method*. His soul, meanwhile, survived by utilizing the *Yin God Ghost Immortal Method* he had deduced in his previous life, transforming into a Yin God to maintain his life force.

"'Death and rebirth', so that's what it means..."

Lu Yang pondered.

At this moment, his physical body was like an alchemy furnace, and the three supreme divine abilities he had mastered in life had become the medicinal ingredients within the furnace.

The body as the furnace, divine abilities as the medicine, creation as the craft.

The result was to smelt the three supreme divine abilities, transforming them into the [Corpse Severance Immortal] rank. Only then would the *True Lunar Metamorphosis Corpse Severance Method* be truly cultivated.

"This process will likely be very long."

"Moreover, it's not something that can be achieved just by spending time. While the body is the furnace, the fire used to refine the elixir is fueled by my merits and fortune."

Burning merits and fortune, transforming them into alchemical flames to be fed into the physical body—this act was inherently defying death. If he failed to refine the [Corpse Severance Immortal] rank even after his merits and fortune were exhausted, he would truly die. Furthermore, with his fortune and merits depleted, he wouldn't even be able to be reborn as a human in the next life, only entering the animal realm.

"No wonder I haven't heard of anyone else cultivating this great divine ability in the Saint Sect."

The gains and sacrifices were completely disproportionate.

One could imagine the sheer determination of the cultivator who created this great divine ability back then. They poured their entire life's effort into it, leaving themselves no retreat.

This was cultivation.

Walking the Grand Dao alone, there was only advancement, no retreat. Even exhausting everything, one could only gamble on an opportunity. If one won, that was fine, but if one lost, how much despair would that entail?

Thinking of this, Lu Yang couldn't help but feel a pang in his heart and burst into tears.

It wasn't until he saw the panel of the Hundred Lives Book beside him that he snapped back to reality. He slapped his forehead, "I almost forgot, I can 'restart' after all. Then it's fine."

"With my soul lacking the protection of a physical body, my mind is hard to guard, and my emotions got the better of me..."

Lu Yang quickly reined in his thoughts and turned to look at Yu Suzhen.

Although Yu Suzhen appeared no different at this moment, internally, she was no longer truly herself; she had been tainted with Lu Yang's influence.

The Sky-Stealing Art had directly transformed her into a puppet.

From now on, no matter how far Yu Suzhen cultivated, Lu Yang could instantly drain her cultivation and fortune with a single thought, then use it to nourish himself.

"But no rush."

"Next, I'll find a way to legitimately pass the Sky-Stealing Art to her, then let her plunder others' cultivation. I'll fatten her up, then butcher her."

Thinking of this, Lu Yang's gaze shifted to Liu Xin, who was waiting outside the cave dwelling.

Saint Sect, Joyful Union Hall.

Yu Suzhen followed behind Liu Xin, her lotus steps graceful, her figure lithe and enchanting, exuding extreme charm, yet her face carried a coolness that pushed people a thousand miles away.

This stark contrast, combined with Yu Suzhen's inherently delicate beauty, immediately drew the gazes of many disciples. Even Liu Xin couldn't help but glance at her, a hint of dark desire flickering in the depths of his eyes. However, he quickly suppressed this evil flame.

Business was important.

"Junior Sister Yu, this is the *Innate Dao Scripture*, the cultivation method for our Saint Sect's formal disciples. Take it back and study it thoroughly; do not neglect your cultivation."

"Thank you, Senior Brother."

Yu Suzhen curtsied, and from Liu Xin's perspective, he could just look down upon a vast expanse of snow-white skin. A faint, ethereal fragrance wafted to his nose.

Liu Xin swallowed, then suddenly pulled her into his arms. Instantly, the beauty was in his embrace, her cool face showing a perfectly feigned hint of panic, her voice clear and melodious: "Ah~! Senior Brother, what are you doing? Quick, let go, quick..."

As she spoke, Yu Suzhen pushed against Liu Xin.

However, those fair, jade-like hands pressing against Liu Xin's chest, far from exerting force, were so soft they felt more like a massage.

Seeing this, Liu Xin's lust grew stronger, and he couldn't help but let out a cackle:

"Junior Sister misunderstands, we're just discussing the Dao..."

Thinking of this, Liu Xin disregarded Yu Suzhen's 'resistance' and directly carried her into the cave dwelling.

One day later.

The lazy aftermath completely numbed Liu Xin's mind, making him drop all his guard.

When he came to his senses, he found his body limply sprawled on the bed, not a single bit of true qi available throughout his entire body!

Immediately after, Yu Suzhen calmly rose.

It was only then that Liu Xin realized he was emitting a putrid smell. His expression instantly turned ghastly, and he looked at Yu Suzhen with shock and fury:

"You poisoned me!?"

"What else?" Yu Suzhen's face was expressionless, her previous allure seemingly a complete sham. "You wanted to harm me, do you expect me not to fight back?"

"How is this possible, you bitch! How did you find out!?"

Liu Xin gritted his teeth, desperately trying to circulate his true qi to suppress the poison, but to no avail. He could only watch helplessly as his body grew weaker and weaker.

Yu Suzhen sneered, "Initially, of course, I didn't know. I just found it suspicious. After all, I ascended from the Joyful Union Hall, so logically, I should have been given a dual cultivation method. But you gave me some inexplicable *Innate Dao Scripture*, clearly not with good intentions."

Liu Xin's face was full of disbelief: "Based on that, you want to kill me?"

"Why not?" Yu Suzhen flashed a smile, revealing her teeth. "A woman's intuition is very sharp. Besides, even if I was wrong, what would I have lost?"

Hearing this, Liu Xin immediately became furious: "You—"

"Don't worry, I won't kill you so quickly," Yu Suzhen continued. "You're at mid-Qi Refining; I assume you know many powerful divine abilities and cultivation methods."

"These are valuable resources, not to be wasted."

"After I learn a true cultivation method and return, I'll drain you completely. That way, your life's effort won't go to waste even after you die."

"...Pfft!"

Before she finished speaking, Liu Xin, already consumed by rage, could no longer hold back. He immediately spat out a mouthful of hot blood, then his vision went black, and he fainted.
