# Chapter 222: The Han You Tribe

"Sanshi, go down first and find a place to stop." Zhang Jing said softly.

"Yes, Master." Lu Sanshi, who was fleeing at full speed towards Sanyuan City, didn't ask further. After responding, his streak of light suddenly changed direction and descended straight downwards.

Three to five breaths later, at the foot of a wilderness hillock, the streak of light gradually dissipated, revealing Lu Sanshi and Zhang Jing on his back.

Looking around, ancient trees grew lush and green. The old path paved with碎stone in the distance was overgrown with weeds, almost unrecognizable. The occasional roars of demonic beasts and savage beasts further highlighted the desolation and solitude of the place.

Zhang Jing nodded in satisfaction. He then gently dismounted from Lu Sanshi's back.

"Sanshi, Master has something to do. Pay attention to the surroundings."

"I understand, please rest assured, Master!"

With that, Zhang Jing took a step, and his figure instantly appeared on a giant rock a hundred *zhang* away, where he sat cross-legged. He lowered his head, his gaze gently falling upon the white jade decree in his hand.

"The Ice Crystal Sprites... I wonder what they look like, and if they will obey my command." Zhang Jing's gaze narrowed, a hint of unease rising in his heart. After all, his current cultivation was only at the Golden Core Realm.

He had not chosen to summon the Ice Crystal Sprites in Sanyuan City. On one hand, the city was crowded and complicated, with a large number of mortals residing there. Moreover, it was his first time summoning an Ice Crystal Sprite. If anything unexpected happened, it might harm the innocent and needlessly accrue karma.

On the other hand, Sanyuan City was, after all, an Immortal Dao force. It was always better to avoid trouble.

...

Everything went dark. Then, Zhang Jing found himself on an ice and snow wasteland. As far as the eye could see, it was a vast expanse of white. The ice and snow stretched to the horizon. Behind him, towering snow peaks and ice mountains rose continuously, among which faint activity of various creatures, strong and weak, could be seen.

*Where is this?* Zhang Jing was momentarily stunned.

Suddenly, "Are you our Master?" A timid voice abruptly appeared beside him. He couldn't help but look down.

A small figure, about two *chi* tall, exquisitely carved from what looked like pink jade, emitting a faint ethereal blue light, suddenly appeared in his vision. Its two crystal-clear, sapphire-like eyes were particularly striking. The aura emanating from it had unmistakably reached the Golden Core Realm.

"You are... an Ice Crystal Sprite?" Zhang Jing squatted down, curiously examining the little ice crystal figure wearing a tiny *ruqun*.

"And a little girl, at that." A smile flickered in his eyes.

"Reporting to Master, my name is Bing Liangliang. I am a warrior of the Ice Crystal Sprite's Han You Tribe." Facing Zhang Jing's gaze, the little ice crystal figure seemed a bit shy, clutching her skirt hem tightly with her two transparent little hands as she answered timidly.

"Han You Tribe! Could this tribe be the Ice Crystal Sprite servants that Aunt Baichan gifted to me?" Zhang Jing thought to himself, a hint of realization dawning on him.

For a moment, he felt a special connection between the white jade decree in his hand and the little Ice Crystal Sprite, Bing Liangliang.

"Bing Liangliang, is it?" Zhang Jing reached out and gently rubbed her small head, then continued to ask, "Where is this place? And how did you know I am your Master? Also, what is the current situation of your Han You Tribe, how many tribesmen do you have, and what is their strength? And also..."

A series of questions poured from Zhang Jing's mouth. In an instant, a look of bewilderment spread visibly across Bing Liangliang's shining gem-like eyes.

"Master, um... I'm sorry, Liangliang's brain is slow, I can't remember so many things." Bing Liangliang drooped her little head, her gaze dimming. A hint of dejection could be heard in her voice.

Seeing this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but shake his head slightly, about to comfort her. However, the next moment, she looked up, gave a simple smile, and then excitedly said, "Hehe, but the Tribal Chief will definitely know! Master, Liangliang will take you to see the Tribal Chief. And the other tribesmen, everyone has been looking forward to your arrival for a long time!"

With that, Bing Liangliang stretched out her two small hands and tightly grasped the hem of Zhang Jing's clothes, as if afraid he would run off. She almost hung entirely on Zhang Jing.

...

Not long after, led by Bing Liangliang, Zhang Jing walked directly into a magnificent ice mountain. The interior of the ice mountain had been hollowed out, forming a vast space tens of thousands of *zhang* wide, where rows upon rows of small ice houses, about half a person's height, were neatly arranged. Numerous figures, all ice crystal sprites like Bing Liangliang, moved within. Their auras, strong and weak, rose and fell.

As Zhang Jing arrived, this Ice Crystal Kingdom suddenly began to stir. Countless excited and eager gazes turned towards Zhang Jing, seemingly anticipating something.

...

In the center of a magnificent ice palace, Zhang Jing sat cross-legged. Opposite him sat a pure white Ice Crystal Sprite, roughly his height, whose aura was immensely terrifying. The figure simply sat there quietly, yet it gave Zhang Jing a dreadful feeling, as if an ancient ice mountain had descended upon the world, threatening to freeze everything. This was the Tribal Chief of the Han You Tribe.

"A Dao Integration Realm Ice Crystal Sprite!" A hint of surprise flickered across Zhang Jing's face. He had not expected that among the immortal spirit servants Aunt Baichan had gifted him, there would be a Dao Integration Realm existence!

On the other side, noticing Zhang Jing's change in expression, "It seems this old man's presence has startled Master," the Tribal Chief said with a gentle, smiling voice. The fact that the other party held a True Lord's Decree and had come here spoke volumes.

"May I ask for Tribal Chief's name?" Zhang Jing asked tentatively. Although nominally, the other party was his servant, and he was their Master, the vast disparity in cultivation between them forced Zhang Jing to be cautious. After all, this was a Dao Integration Realm existence, almost possessing eternal longevity. Even in the human race's various heavenly realms, such a figure would be renowned.

"Master, you may call me Hansheng. Furthermore, please rest assured, Master, as long as you do not despise us, our Han You Tribe will always be your most loyal subordinates." The Tribal Chief said with a smile, simultaneously putting Zhang Jing's mind at ease.

Upon hearing this, Zhang Jing slowly exhaled a sigh of relief. He looked at the figure opposite him, hesitated for a moment, and then asked forthrightly, "Tribal Chief Hansheng, how many Ice Crystal Sprites are currently in your Han You Tribe, and what is their strength?"

"Reporting to Master," Hansheng replied, "The Han You Tribe currently has nine hundred and eighty-three tribesmen. As for strength, if divided according to your human race's Immortal Dao classifications, there is one Dao Integration Realm, thirty-eight Fascia Realm, five hundred and ninety-one Golden Core Realm, and the rest are all Foundation Establishment Realm."

"There are no Qi Refining Realm ones?" Zhang Jing asked in surprise.

"I wouldn't dare deceive Master. We Ice Crystal Sprites are considered high-grade natural immortal spirits. We are naturally attuned to the Dao of Ice, and upon birth, we are already at the Foundation Establishment Realm."

*So that's how it is.* Zhang Jing suddenly understood, a hint of envy rising unconsciously in his heart. As expected of these so-called natural immortal spirits. Born at the Foundation Establishment Realm, their lifespans were also counted in tens of thousands of years.

...

Then, Zhang Jing seemed to think of something, his gaze burning brightly as he looked at Hansheng opposite him, asking expectantly, "Tribal Chief Hansheng, can you come out with me for a trip?"

However, facing Zhang Jing's gaze, an apologetic expression immediately appeared on Hansheng's face, his voice filled with regret: "Reporting to Master, this place is called the Extreme Ice Plain, and it is fraught with dangers. If this old one were to leave, I fear there would be no one to look after the tribe, and there might be a danger of collapse. I hope Master will understand."

"Furthermore—" The other party hesitated to speak, as if there was some unspoken difficulty.

...

Time flowed slowly. A flash of light appeared before his eyes. Zhang Jing abruptly opened them. He found that the scenery before him had returned to the wilderness from before. Not far in front, Lu Sanshi was nervously observing the surroundings, his expression exceptionally serious.

*Hoo—* Zhang Jing exhaled a breath of turbid air. The scene from the Extreme Ice Plain just now flashed through his mind.

"The Extreme Ice Plain, neither real nor illusory, both tangible and intangible. What exactly is that place? Could it be Aunt Baichan's grotto-heaven cultivation ground, or perhaps a world she created and evolved through her cultivation of the Primordial Chaos Realm Dao?" Zhang Jing wondered curiously.

His thoughts returned to reality. With a thought, the white jade decree in his hand trembled. Following that, a pitch-black vortex about two *chi* wide slowly appeared before Zhang Jing, from which wisps of extreme ice and cold aura permeated. Three Ice Crystal Sprites laboriously crawled out of the vortex. Their immense auras, at the peak of the Fascia Realm, flashed and vanished.

"Bing Feng greets Master, may we ask what Master commands?" After the three Ice Crystal Sprites emerged, they first curiously surveyed their surroundings, then knelt directly before Zhang Jing, speaking in unison. Their voices were icy, but their tone carried a faint warmth.

"In that direction, about five thousand *li* away, there's a nascent spiritual land. Three human Fascia Realm cultivators are guarding it. You three, first help Master keep an eye on them."

"If those three make any moves to destroy the spiritual land, you must do everything in your power to stop them. If they do nothing, then ignore them."

"Be careful to conceal your auras," Zhang Jing instructed with a smile, pointing in the direction of Lingshu Mountain.

"We will not fail Master's expectations!" The three Ice Crystal Sprites, led by Bing Feng, respectfully replied. As their voices faded, their figures quietly disappeared from their original spot.

Seeing this, Zhang Jing finally felt a slight ease.

His gaze shifted. The deep, pitch-black vortex that had initially summoned the Ice Crystal Sprites had not yet dissipated. He communicated with the decree in his mind, intending to close it. However, the next moment, a small head abruptly poked out from within, timidly staring at Zhang Jing, its two ice-blue pigtails swaying incessantly. In its sapphire-like eyes, a glimmer of hope shone. It was Bing Liangliang.

She spoke piteously, "Master, Master, Liangliang wants to come out and see too."
