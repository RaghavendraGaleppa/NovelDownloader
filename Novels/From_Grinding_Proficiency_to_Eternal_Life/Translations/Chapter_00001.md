# Chapter 1: Mining

The darkness beneath the mine shaft was absolute. Xu Yunfan, his clothes in tatters and his body covered in black mine dust, gasped for breath. He looked at the blood blisters on his palms, clenched his lips tightly, and once again raised his iron pickaxe, swinging it toward the ore on the tunnel wall.

Beside him, Zhou Feng looked at his own pickaxe with a listless expression. He couldn't help but mutter, "I don't want to stay here. We don't get enough to eat or wear. If the mine collapses, we'll all be buried alive."

*Clang!*

"Zhang Li, who came down with us yesterday, collapsed from exhaustion and illness. After he was dragged away, we never heard from him again. No one's seen him since."

Seeing that Xu Yunfan paid him no mind and continued to swing his pickaxe with all his might, Zhou Feng pressed on. "Do you want to end up like Zhang Li? Have your food stolen by Jiang Yu, and work yourself to death just for a mouthful to fill your stomach? How much suffering did we endure under him back then? And now we're still being humiliated by him here. I'm not willing to accept this! If you keep working yourself to the bone like this, you won't even last a month. You won't be able to get out when the next rotation comes!"

Originally, Xu Yunfan's movements had been stiff, but now they became smooth and powerful. He settled his hips, and with every swing of the pickaxe, his bare feet gripped the ground, his thighs rose and fell, and his waist and hips swayed as if riding a horse. A surge of power traveled from his body, through his arms, and into the pickaxe before crashing down heavily.

*Clang!*

The sound of the pickaxe striking the rock was far louder than before, echoing clearly through the winding tunnel.

Xu Yunfan looked at the information prompt appearing in his vision, and his eyes couldn't help but well up with tears.

Do you know what these past three days have been like for me?

When others transmigrated, they ate and drank to their heart's content. Before transmigrating, he was a beast of burden, and after transmigrating, he was even worse off than a beast of burden.

Ancient miners, especially those like him who had been demoted to the lowest class of slaves due to their families' crimes, were considered expendable. If they died, they died.

If it weren't for the attribute panel and the mining prompt that appeared when he swung his pickaxe, he might have really lost the will to go on.

He wasn't joking.

As the information prompt quietly appeared in his vision, his body began to undergo a marvelous change. The originally tense and slightly stiff muscles gradually relaxed, and the tension in his body dissipated.

A stream of memories flowed slowly through his mind. In these memories, he had spent seven or eight years digging in this mine shaft, surviving countless dangers. Through practice, he had finally mastered the use of the pickaxe in his hand.

Xu Yunfan raised his pickaxe again. His waist twisted like a snake, driving the muscles of his back and shoulders to rise and fall, providing support for his arms. His thighs acted like springs; his feet were firmly planted on the ground, and as his waist exerted force, they contracted and extended abruptly, resonating with the strength of his entire body to form a combined force.

*Clang!*

A crisp, resonant sound of metal striking rock rang out, echoing through the winding tunnel.

He could clearly feel that his back and arms were no longer sore and weak as before. Instead, they felt exhilarated, as if he couldn't quite get enough.

Zhou Feng was filled with astonishment. Just a moment ago, he had thought that if Xu Yunfan kept exerting himself so recklessly, he would inevitably work himself to death in the mine due to injury and exhaustion. He never expected that single swing of the pickaxe to shake his own confidence.

He watched as Xu Yunfan turned around and sat down on the ground. From his怀里, Xu Yunfan pulled out a dry, hard ration made from bran and silently washed it down with water.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's submissive appearance, Zhou Feng cursed in anger. He stepped forward and grabbed Xu Yunfan by the collar. "Do you just want to die in this mine? Don't you want to escape?"

"We were implicated by that Jiang Yu. It's already a stroke of luck that we weren't beheaded. Escape? Who doesn't want to escape? But who can?" Xu Yunfan said with some helplessness. The original body was a servant. In the Great Zhou Empire, the current Empress had seized power. The conservative faction was being played against each other, suppressed, and executed.

Jiang Yu's father was executed, the Jiang family's property was confiscated, the men were exiled, and the women of marriageable age were sent to the pleasure quarters. He, too, had been demoted to the mine shaft along with his wicked master. Yet, Jiang Yu still acted as if he were a big shot. Yesterday, Zhang Li had his food stolen by Jiang Yu. Zhang Li had wanted to mine another cartload of ore to trade for food, but unfortunately, he collapsed and died halfway.

"You... Do you know that after being implicated by the Jiang family and becoming a mining slave under the Mining Supervision Office, almost no one can last three years? With a body like yours and mine, we won't last a month. We're dead for sure."

He had no doubt about Zhou Feng's words. In such a harsh living environment, even if one wasn't worked to death, they would die from various illnesses caused by the terrible external conditions. In the three days since he had entered the mine shaft, new people came in every day, and every day, people died from illness, injury, or exhaustion from failing to meet their mining quota. They were dragged away after lying on the ground, and then were never seen again.

This place was located in the extreme north of the Great Zhou Dynasty, surrounded by endless glaciers and barren mountains. As the days grew colder, the winds howled and blizzards raged on the surface. Because the mine was deep, it could maintain a certain temperature. But once one crossed the permafrost layer to the surface, without any protection, anyone with a slightly weaker constitution would die from hypothermia in just a couple of hours.

Even if one escaped the mine, what then? With such a harsh environment, what were the chances of survival?

Seeing Xu Yunfan's submissive attitude, Zhou Feng felt both pity for his misfortune and anger at his lack of ambition. In the end, he could only let go, sit down heavily to the side, and bury his head in silence.

Xu Yunfan knew the other man. Since childhood, he and the original body had been servants in the Jiang family. They had grown up together. As they belonged to different departments and had no conflict of interest, they had a good relationship.

Zhou Feng was currently trying to unite with some miners who couldn't stand it anymore to plot an escape from this place. Naturally, he wanted to pull Xu Yunfan into his plan.

But this world was not simple at all.

Three days ago, when he had just transmigrated and was about to enter the mine shaft, he saw a young man who was unwilling to go. The youth turned to run, but a supervisor whipped him and tore him in two. His corpse was still lying there as a warning to others.

Even now, the memory sent a chill down his spine.

Given Zhou Feng's lack of physical labor and knowledge of the world, wanting to escape from here...

It was truly a difficult task.

Xu Yunfan had an attribute panel and had just reached the Novice level in his mining skill. His chances of survival in this mine had been greatly increased. Naturally, he wanted to advance further and then look for an opportunity.

"Zhou Feng, we need to settle down first and find a way to survive. Even if we can escape the mine, what then? With eight hundred li of barren plains and glaciers, can we really get out?"

Zhou Feng muttered, "As long as we can escape this mine pit, the sky is the limit. Eight hundred li of barren plains, can't we walk through it? I have a way. Are you really not coming?"

Xu Yunfan felt helpless. From the original body's memories, Zhou Feng had never once left the capital city, Jingcheng, in his entire life. Did he even know what eight hundred li of barren plains meant?

Xu Yunfan said, "We don't even know the surrounding environment. We at least need to explore the area clearly before we can make plans."

Watching as Xu Yunfan rested for a while and then picked up his pickaxe to start mining again, Zhou Feng's finger trembled as he pointed at him. In the end, with a flick of his sleeve, he stormed off in a huff.

Xu Yunfan turned his head to look at Zhou Feng's retreating back, sighed, and continued to mine.
