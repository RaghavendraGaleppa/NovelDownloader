# Chapter 19: The First Realm of Martial Arts is Consuming Essence Treasures

That night, the swelling on Zhao Han, Wang Chun, and Zhuo Yilie’s cheeks grew worse, distorting their facial features until their skin was stretched tight as a ball.

The pain wasn't sharp, but it was maddeningly persistent. The Green Luo Palm’s energy remained trapped within their flesh, causing their blood and qi to stagnate and become viscous. Where there is stagnation, there is pain.

It felt like constant needle pricks. Though bearable, it was enough to drive a man insane.

By the latter half of the night, the skin on their faces swelled to its limit and actually split open, oozing thick blood and pus. The sight was terrifying.

Li Xian truly felt the potency of martial arts for the first time. A few light slaps could cause such prolonged suffering.

All he could do was fetch clean water to wash away the blood for the three of them and apply ice from the well to their wounds to ease their pain.

“Damn it all!”

Wang Chun, consumed by rage, slammed his fist into the bed. The curse didn't target anyone specifically; perhaps it was just a release of pain and anger, or perhaps it was directed at someone in particular.

His eyes, however, flickered toward Li Xian’s face.

There was a sense of imbalance in his heart.

“Fourth Brother, go get some rest,” Zhao Han said weakly. “Remember to report to the patrol office tomorrow. I won't be able to go with you.”

“Make sure to ask for leave for us. We can't possibly go out looking like this; we'd be laughed to death.”

In the latter half of the night, the pain subsided, and the swelling began to recede. Zhao Han spoke with labored breath.

“Alright,” Li Xian replied. Seeing that their condition had stabilized, he felt somewhat relieved. After tidying up the room, he lay down on his bed and closed his eyes.

But he didn't sleep. He thought to himself, “Martial arts... martial arts... Only by mastering martial arts can I avoid being bullied!”

Occasionally hearing the groans of the three men, Li Xian slept fitfully.

In a daze, he had a dream. In it, he found a hidden treasury of martial arts, filled with countless techniques, and finally found his own path to becoming stronger.

The next day.

As soon as he woke up, a transparent screen flashed before his eyes.

[Skill: Sleeping]
[Proficiency: 293/500 (Beginner)]
[Description: Sleeping once a day, yet still knowing nothing. It is not a lack of talent, but simply that the time for fortune has not yet arrived.]

Li Xian was surprised. Usually, his [Sleeping] proficiency increased slightly every day, typically by 4 or 5 points. But today, it had jumped by 28 points.

“Could it be... that last night's dream actually trained my sleeping skill? Well, I don't know what this skill is for, so there's no point in dwelling on it.”

Since the swelling hadn't completely subsided, Li Xian helped the three of them ask for leave, allowing them to rest in bed.

“Relying on others is never as good as relying on oneself!”

After waking up and completing his morning training—running several laps around the manor—Li Xian didn't look for Jiang Yun. Instead, he went straight to Pang Long’s residence.

“Li Xian?”

Pang Long was carrying a millstone on his shoulder, tempering his physique. Seeing Li Xian approach, he tossed the millstone into a corner of the yard. Strangely, though the millstone was a heavy object, it landed as lightly as a feather.

Li Xian was awestruck. Such martial arts prowess was truly惊人 (astonishing).

“You aren't practicing your fists today; you came all the way here. What for?”

“Since you're here, have some water.”

Pang Long poured a cup of water and tossed it to Li Xian. Li Xian caught it and took a sip. “Commander Pang, I’d like to discuss something with you.”

“Oh?” Pang Long smiled. “Are you asking about the secrets of martial arts again?”

Li Xian’s heart skipped a beat, but that wasn't why he was here today. “I was wondering if it’s possible to exchange the Tiger Blood Pill you rewarded me with for a martial art technique?”

“What martial art?” Pang Long asked casually.

“Green Luo Palm,” Li Xian said firmly. “Is it possible to exchange the Tiger Blood Pill for the Green Luo Palm technique?”

Pang Long wiped away his sweat, draped the towel over a bamboo rack, and frowned slightly. “Green Luo Palm? That’s an Entry-Level martial art. It isn't under my jurisdiction, nor do I have the authority to teach it myself.”

“Furthermore, at your current stage, your body is still weak. Practicing an Entry-Level martial art would do you more harm than good; it would drain your vital energy and blood.”

“That Tiger Blood Pill is your best option right now. If I were you, I’d take it as soon as possible.”

Li Xian asked, “Commander Pang, if I want to obtain the Green Luo Palm, is there a way?”

Pang Long’s gaze sharpened, scrutinizing him. “You really want to learn the Green Luo Palm?” Li Xian nodded heavily. “I really do.”

“The Green Luo Palm is in the Leisure Martial Pavilion, managed by Lady’s maid, Qiu Yue. When it opens and when one can enter is not up to me to decide. Since you want to go... fine, I’ll keep an eye out for news regarding it.”

“You should focus on your current training and fulfilling your duties as a guard.”

“Among all the guards, you’re the only one who seems to have the potential to rise up.”

Pang Long walked over and patted Li Xian on the shoulder.

“Thank you for your recognition, Commander.” Hearing that there was no hope for now, Li Xian had to suppress his thoughts for the time being.

“So, do you still have questions about the Martial Path?” Pang Long asked with a smile.

“Are you willing to tell me now?” Li Xian naturally welcomed the opportunity.

“It’s not that I’m unwilling... it’s just that... I’ve vaguely touched upon that realm. I’ve been looking for someone to brag to about it,” Pang Long laughed heartily, his rough features filled with obvious joy.

Li Xian thought to himself, *When a man meets good fortune, his spirits soar.* But this was perfect; he could use this chance to peek into that mysterious domain.

Pang Long sat down in the yard and began to reminisce. “I was originally a street brawler from the Jianghu. I’ve been to many places, killed people, and nearly been killed myself. Later, I was subdued by the Lady and became the commander of the guards, helping her watch over this vast estate.”

“A while ago, the Lady bestowed a soup upon me. After drinking it, I finally made some progress. I’m getting closer to that realm...”

Li Xian asked, “What realm?”

“The realm of shedding one’s mortal body and being reborn!” Pang Long’s voice grew heavier, and a sharp light flashed in his eyes. “What martial artists seek in this world is to shed their mortal coils! The ultimate goal of practicing martial arts to perfection is to be reborn!”

“I didn’t tell you before because I didn’t want you to become arrogant after seeing the bigger picture, or fall into depression. I was once like that myself.”

“Then why are you telling me now?” Li Xian asked.

“Hahaha,” Pang Long said. “Naturally... because I am about to touch that layer myself. If I can succeed, it’s possible for the other guards to succeed as well. In that case, it’s no longer about being arrogant, but about having a goal and a pursuit.”

Pang Long said, “The Martial Path! It is about consuming the essence of heaven and earth and drinking the精华 (vital essence) of the sun and moon to strengthen oneself. This point... I have touched upon it faintly.”

“Martial artists do not rely on breathing techniques; they rely on eating! They rely on training!”

“We who practice martial arts are born as ‘clay figurines,’ also known as ‘clay idols.’ Through diligent practice of martial arts later in life, we strengthen ourselves and accumulate internal force. When the time comes, our internal force is abundant, our physique is strong, and our martial arts attainments are profound. When we have tempered this clay body thoroughly and can fully utilize the medicinal effects of ‘Essence Treasures,’ we have touched upon the first realm of the Martial Path: ‘Consuming Essence.’”

As he spoke, Pang Long’s face was filled with anticipation.

He had only just stepped half a foot into the realm of “Consuming Essence”; the road ahead was still long.

“Little Xian...” Pang Long sighed. “You might not be able to feel my joy. But there is one thing I can tell you in advance. Martial arts... are forever the foundation of the Martial Path!”

“This is what the Lady said. She told me, and now I am telling you. You... must slowly comprehend this.”

Looking at Pang Long’s high-spirited face, a realization flashed through Li Xian’s mind: “I understand. A martial artist is one who, after practicing martial arts to a certain level, begins to seek to shed their mortal body and be reborn.”

“In that case, the initial realm of the Martial Path is the Clay Figurine Realm. I am currently at the Clay Figurine Realm.”
