# Chapter 101: Forging Extraordinary Pills  

The next day, Lin Xuan used the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art to alter his appearance once more and arrived at Hailong Pavilion as agreed, purchasing the reserved Perseverance Grass without any issues.  

While in the market, he overheard cultivators discussing how someone had made a grand gesture the previous day by selling over a thousand Marrow-Cleansing Pills at once. This served as a stark reminder to Lin Xuan—his actions yesterday had indeed been somewhat reckless. Though he had narrowly averted disaster, the danger had been real. Even with his disguise, he couldn’t afford to be so careless in the future.  

After leaving the market, Lin Xuan flew northward on his sword light. According to the information he had gathered, the northern region of Youzhou was sparsely populated, making it the perfect place to find a secluded spot for refining top-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills and attempting his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment stage.  

Three days later, Lin Xuan descended upon a desolate mountain.  

The surrounding area was rugged and wild, teeming with fierce beasts but devoid of human presence—an ideal location for secluded cultivation.  

Satisfied, Lin Xuan surveyed the area before selecting a cave halfway up a steep cliff. Only birds could reach such a place; ordinary beasts and mortals would never be able to climb it.  

He summoned his flying sword to make minor adjustments to the cave, quickly carving out a simple abode. Then, he retrieved a talisman from his robes—his last remaining formation talisman. Though reluctant, he channeled his spiritual power and activated it.  

The spiritual energy triggered the sealed formation, and the burning talisman transformed into a small yin-yang Bagua symbol. It rapidly expanded, flying out of the cave to envelop the entire dwelling in a protective barrier.  

After setting up the barrier, Lin Xuan rested for the night. By dawn the next day, his stamina and spiritual power had fully recovered, and he began his alchemical work.  

First, he prepared the ingredients.  

Refining Marrow-Cleansing Pills was now second nature to Lin Xuan. Though high-grade pills were slightly more challenging, his current cultivation level was far beyond what it had been before. Within three days, he had successfully purified a hundred high-grade pills.  

He had already obtained Silvermoon Flowers and Firefly Grass, and now he had successfully acquired Perseverance Grass as well.  

However, Lin Xuan wasn’t reckless enough to begin refining immediately. This was his first attempt, and failure was almost inevitable.  

He first retrieved a jade slip and meticulously studied the art of pill refining. Beyond reading, he frequently left the cave to gather herbs in the surrounding area for practice.  

Naturally, he couldn’t find any rare treasures nearby. The pills he refined were ordinary ones meant for healing injuries or strengthening the body—priceless in the mortal world but of little use to cultivators. Lin Xuan was merely honing his skills.  

According to the classifications of the immortal world, alchemists were divided into several tiers. Refining such low-grade pills would only allow him to reach the beginner level at best. However, secondary refinement was actually easier than crafting low-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills from scratch. Moreover, with the Perseverance Grass to boost his success rate, Lin Xuan was confident in his abilities.  

Time flowed like water, and half a year passed in the blink of an eye.  

Though his cultivation level hadn’t advanced during this time, Lin Xuan’s spiritual power had grown more refined, and he had gained a solid understanding of alchemy.  

One morning, Lin Xuan decided it was time to refine the top-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills.  

He retrieved a small cauldron from his storage bracelet. The material it was made of was unknown, but its ancient design and the intricate carvings of the Four Divine Beasts—Vermilion Bird, Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise—marked it as anything but ordinary.  

Next, he took out several spirit stones and arranged them in the pattern of the Big Dipper.  

"Rise!"  

Lin Xuan tossed the cauldron into the air, forming a sphere with his hands as he channeled spiritual power into the stones. The Big Dipper formation lit up, each stone emitting a beam of light in a different color. The radiant hues converged, suspending the cauldron midair.  

With a solemn expression, Lin Xuan picked up a small vial beside him and threw it into the air. Then, he sent a spell seal toward the cauldron.  

A beam of white light shot out from the cauldron, shattering the vial with a *bang*. The high-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills inside were drawn into the cauldron like a whale swallowing water. With a flick of his sleeve, Lin Xuan added Silvermoon Flowers and Firefly Grass, followed by a powder ground from Perseverance Grass.  

Once all the ingredients were in place, Lin Xuan flipped his hand, revealing a fiery-red talisman—the Earthfire Talisman, specially designed for low-level cultivators to refine pills.  

Infusing it with spiritual power, he blew on it, and the talisman transformed into a crimson fireball that settled beneath the cauldron.  

Though Lin Xuan had refined over a hundred batches of pills before, crafting top-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills was undoubtedly more challenging and time-consuming.  

Based on his calculations, the process would take at least forty-nine days. The slightest mistake during this period could ruin everything.  

And with the materials he had left, Lin Xuan couldn’t afford a second attempt. Failure was not an option.  

Time slipped by unnoticed.  

A month passed...  

Finally, the forty-ninth day arrived.  

Gazing at the cauldron enveloped in flames, Lin Xuan exhaled softly. Everything had gone smoothly. Secondary refinement wasn’t overly difficult, and with his thorough preparations and the Perseverance Grass powder to enhance the success rate, it seemed the top-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills would be successfully forged.  

Even without a spiritual root, the sheer potency of a hundred top-grade pills should be enough to defy the heavens and allow him to break through to Foundation Establishment. If he still failed, it would defy all logic!  

A faint smile touched Lin Xuan’s lips—until a faint *clink* reached his ears.  

His brows furrowed, and his expression darkened.  

Of all times, someone had to disturb him now. That sound was the alarm triggered by his formation being tampered with.  

Lin Xuan quickly sent a few spell seals to stabilize the cauldron and the Earthfire before extending his spiritual sense. A cultivator in his forties stood at the cave entrance.  

Peak Qi Condensation stage.  

Seeing the man’s cultivation level, Lin Xuan relaxed slightly. As long as it wasn’t a Foundation Establishment expert, he could handle it. Thanks to consuming large quantities of ginseng essence, his spiritual power was far purer than that of his peers, giving him a clear advantage in combat.  

After a brief consideration, Lin Xuan channeled his spiritual power and sent a message outward: "Halt, fellow Daoist. This is my abode, and I do not welcome disturbances. Please leave."  

Tan Ming, hearing the voice transmission, hesitated as he examined the formation barrier before him. "A guest from afar should not be turned away so coldly. Since fate has brought us together, why not invite me in for a chat?"  

Though the words sounded polite, Lin Xuan sneered inwardly. In the world of cultivation, strength ruled supreme. Whether one followed the righteous path or tread the demonic way, killing for treasure was commonplace.  

Back in the Drifting Cloud Sect, his seniors had warned him that cultivators in secluded training often sought uninhabited locations because interruptions during cultivation could easily lead to qi deviation. If a stranger stumbled upon them, nine times out of ten, they would seize the opportunity to attack, knowing the cultivator couldn’t fight back easily.  

This man’s words were nothing but a test. Once he confirmed Lin Xuan was at a critical juncture, he would strike without hesitation.  

A shadow crossed Lin Xuan’s face. Since the other party harbored ill intentions, there was no need for further words. The first to strike gains the advantage; the second suffers the loss.  

Taking a deep breath, Lin Xuan sent several spell seals flying toward the formation.  

After waiting in vain for a response, Tan Ming’s face lit up with greed. It seemed he had stumbled upon a cultivator deep in meditation, unable to move.  

Though eager to kill and plunder, Tan Ming remained cautious. The fact that the other party had set up a formation barrier suggested considerable strength—likely a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Yet this only fueled his avarice. The stronger the opponent, the richer their possessions. And if they couldn’t move freely, what was there to fear?  

Patting his storage pouch, he summoned a spear-like magical artifact.  

Just as Tan Ming prepared to act, the sky abruptly darkened. Though it was midday, visibility dropped to nothing, and a massive Bagua symbol appeared overhead.  

"An illusion?" Tan Ming’s heart clenched. He realized he had been trapped within the opponent’s formation. The unexpected turn of events left him both shocked and puzzled.  

Had he misjudged the situation? Weren’t they supposed to be incapacitated?  

His eyes darted around, a sly glint flashing within them. "Fellow Daoist, what is the meaning of this? I bear no ill will!"  

"No ill will?"  

Lin Xuan’s lips curled in mockery. Did this man take him for a child? Ignoring the excuse, he sent another red light into the formation.  

Instantly, the Bagua symbol began to spin rapidly, unleashing a torrent of fiery rain.  

Tan Ming yelped and hastily activated a protective barrier. He then summoned a handkerchief-like treasure, which expanded to several zhang in size and floated above his head.  

"A defensive artifact?" Though deep inside the cave, Lin Xuan observed everything clearly through his spiritual sense. (To be continued...)
