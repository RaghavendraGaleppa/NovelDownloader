# Chapter 30: Unexpected News  

"Immortal Master!" Zhao Ming bowed respectfully.  

"Mm." Lin Xuan nodded with an indifferent expression. "How has the Waste Pill Pavilion been these days?"  

"Rest assured, everything is as usual."  

Nearly four months after becoming the overseer of the Waste Pill Pavilion, Lin Xuan finally inspected his domain again. Though the attendants led by Zhao Ming were somewhat surprised, they still served him with cautious reverence.  

To facilitate his cultivation, Lin Xuan had deliberately cultivated an image of being lazy, reclusive, and fond of shutting himself in his room. His original intention was merely to avoid suspicion and interruptions while cultivating. However, this fabricated personality unexpectedly endeared him to the attendants.  

The reason was simple: in the eyes of lofty cultivators, mortals were mere ants. Within the Piaoyun Valley, these attendants held lowly status—ostensibly outer disciples, but in reality, they were little more than servants and laborers, tasked with menial work and serving the cultivators. The slightest mistake could result in scolding, beatings, or even death, with no one to question it.  

The attendants lived each day on thin ice, trembling with fear. If their overseer was a mild-tempered cultivator, they were fortunate. But if they served someone capricious, their lives became a nightmare...  

Among the various mundane tasks assigned across Danxia Mountain, the Waste Pill Pavilion was the least desirable post for cultivators—there were no profits to be had. Conversely, it was the most coveted position for attendants. For a long time, the pavilion had lacked an overseer, and Zhao Ming, a fellow outer disciple, had temporarily filled the role. Life there was not only leisurely but also safe.  

When Lin Xuan first arrived, Zhao Ming and the others dared not voice their displeasure, but inwardly, they were deeply reluctant, believing their peaceful days had come to an end.  

Yet reality defied their expectations. Though Lin Xuan had come, he rarely showed his face, appearing only once every few months. This Immortal Master was reclusive, preferring to stay shut in his room.  

In other words, Lin Xuan's arrival changed nothing about their previous lives. Months passed without a single punishment—so long as they obeyed his sole rule: never approach his living quarters.  

Such an easygoing overseer, such a lenient Immortal Master, was a once-in-a-thousand-years stroke of luck. Zhao Ming and the others genuinely supported Lin Xuan, hoping he would remain the Waste Pill Pavilion's overseer forever. With him there, the sect would never send another cultivator to replace him.  

After inspecting the pavilion and exchanging a few trivial remarks, Lin Xuan instructed the attendants to continue their work diligently, then announced he would go out for some fresh air.  

"Farewell, Immortal Master!"  

Zhao Ming and the others harbored no suspicions. Though their overseer was lazy and disliked movement, it was only natural for him to step out occasionally—no one could stay cooped up forever.  

Once out of sight and alone, Lin Xuan's languid demeanor vanished without a trace. He now appeared sharp and mature, a faint smile playing on his lips as he strode forward.  

These past days, Lin Xuan had pondered many things, considering various methods, yet he still hadn't found a way to learn Spirit Control Technique without arousing suspicion. A perfect solution seemed impossible.  

Mere contemplation wouldn't solve the problem. Rather than sitting idle and racking his brain, he decided to take a walk and see if an opportunity presented itself.  

Once outside Danxia Mountain, Lin Xuan's demeanor shifted again, becoming ordinary and unremarkable. He first wandered around the sect but found nothing of note. Then he headed toward the Scripture Pavilion.  

As a low-level Qi Refining disciple, he could only freely access the first floor. Though he knew it contained no cultivation techniques—only miscellaneous knowledge valuable to mortals but trivial to cultivators—Lin Xuan still searched meticulously, hoping against hope.  

Nothing.  

After a long silence, Lin Xuan gritted his teeth and headed for the second floor.  

Unlike mortal architecture, there were no stairs between the first and second floors. Instead, layers of restrictive barriers prevented flight, and only a teleportation array served as the means of access.  

Lin Xuan had barely taken a few steps when the air before him rippled like water, and a yellow barrier materialized like a solid wall.  

This was a restriction. To reach the teleportation array, one had to break through it—a test designed by the sect. According to their standards, dispelling this barrier required at least early Foundation Establishment cultivation, ensuring only high-level disciples could access the second floor. Of course, exceptions existed for those who obtained the sect leader's permission.  

Studying the yellow light before him, Lin Xuan paused and observed silently. Though conventional wisdom dictated that only a Foundation Establishment cultivator could break this barrier, he believed he stood a chance.  

First, he had mastered the Ice Needle Art, a technique rivaling high-level spells in power. Second, he possessed an extraordinary spirit artifact. If he exerted his full strength, he was confident his offensive power could match that of a newly advanced Foundation Establishment cultivator without a spirit artifact.  

Yet Lin Xuan did not act. Instead, he hesitated briefly before feigning nonchalance and walking away. Both the Ice Needle Art and his spirit artifact were too conspicuous, and he had no desire to draw attention.  

Moreover, even if he broke this barrier and reached the second floor via the teleportation array, there would undoubtedly be further restrictions to accessing the texts.  

Though he longed to learn the Spirit Control Technique, the risk of exposing his strength outweighed the benefits. Thus, Lin Xuan chose not to alert the enemy.  

It seemed he would have to find another way. Having made this decision, Lin Xuan turned to leave—but just then, a conversation reached his ears.  

"Have you heard? The Lingyun Sect is being forced to disband."  

"Hmph, they offended a Core Formation senior. Unless they have a death wish, disbanding is their only option."  

The first cultivator nodded with a sigh. "Though the Lingyun Sect isn't as strong as our Piaoyun Valley, it's still a sect with nearly a thousand years of heritage. They must have plenty of techniques, spirit artifacts, and talismans."  

"Indeed. I heard they're even selling mid-level techniques meant for Foundation Establishment cultivators."
