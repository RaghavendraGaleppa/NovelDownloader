# 第十二章 那个幸运儿

Zhang Jing's legs moved quickly.

"The stone house area is really too far from the lecture hall. It takes a long time to get there every time. It's better to have Brother Ji's first-class courtyard, which is closer."

There was a hint of envy in his words.

It could only be said that having spirit stones was really good!

Fortunately, after rushing, Zhang Jing finally wasn't late, only a little later than usual.

However, at this moment, the futons in the lecture hall were almost full, with only a few scattered seats left at the back.

"It seems everyone wants to improve," Zhang Jing smiled.

Anyway, for him, it didn't matter whether he sat in the front or the back, or even whether Instructor Wang lectured today.

Having skill proficiency was just that awesome.

He casually picked an empty seat and sat down.

Zhang Jing subconsciously looked forward.

As expected, sitting in the front were still Ji Bochang and the other three, as if those four futons were their exclusive spots.

At this moment.

Tap, tap...

A series of footsteps sounded behind him.

Zhang Jing unconsciously turned his head.

In his sight, a young man was walking into the lecture hall in a hurry, with a hint of arrogance on his face.

Wasn't this the guy Instructor Wang had encouraged last time, saying he had a chance to get a C grade?

He was considered a genius, more or less.

After entering the lecture hall, the man first glanced at the futons next to Zhang Jing, frowned, and hesitated to sit down.

The next moment.

"Brother Wang, over here! I've saved you a seat." A small, chubby man sitting in front suddenly stood up and waved enthusiastically.

The man didn't stand on ceremony.

He walked straight to the chubby man and said in a flat tone:

"Come find me tomorrow, and I'll take you through a visualization practice once."

"Thank you, Brother Wang, thank you, Brother Wang!" The chubby man's face flushed with excitement.

Then.

Under the envious gazes of everyone, the chubby man triumphantly walked to the back and plopped down next to Zhang Jing, the flush on his face lingering for a long time.

"Hey, brother, how was that? Was my reaction fast just now?"

The chubby man couldn't help but poke Zhang Jing with his hand, saying with pride, "I actually managed to snatch the opportunity to give up my seat to Brother Wang."

"If I grasp it well tomorrow, maybe I can greatly increase my chances of passing the assessment!"

"Congratulations, congratulations," Zhang Jing said softly.

Only then did he notice that those sitting in the front were all people Instructor Wang had favored to pass the assessment, or even get higher grades.

"What's this? Has the hierarchy been divided so clearly in just five days?"

Zhang Jing complained inwardly.

He found the scene before him incredibly realistic.

"Hey, brother," as if sensing Zhang Jing's absent-mindedness, the chubby man couldn't help but advise, "We may be a little lacking in talent, but we can't give up. If you had come as early as I did today, maybe the opportunity would have been yours!"

Without waiting for Zhang Jing to respond.

He then muttered to himself with a hint of regret, "It's a pity that the four prodigies are so high and mighty, and I have no way to get in touch with them. Otherwise, if I could get their guidance..."

"Since you have doubts in your cultivation, why don't you ask Instructor Wang?"

Zhang Jing asked curiously.

"I... I..." The chubby man's face flushed red, "I haven't even fully understood the visualization practice yet."

Hearing this, a trace of understanding flashed across Zhang Jing's face.

He almost forgot that this was, after all, an assessment, and Instructor Wang wouldn't guide everything.

"Wait, the four prodigies?"

Zhang Jing pointed to Ji Bochang and the other three in front and said in surprise, "Are you talking about them?"

"Who else?"

The chubby man looked at Zhang Jing and asked.

Then, as if he had discovered something, he stared at Zhang Jing's face for a long time, and finally said in surprise:

"Hey, brother, aren't you the lucky guy everyone's talking about, the one who's close to Ji Bochang? No wonder you don't care!"

"I really envy you for being able to ask Ji Bochang for guidance at any time!"

As he was speaking.

Instructor Wang appeared on the stage like a ghost.

His sharp gaze swept across the familiar faces in front of him, and he nodded with satisfaction, thinking to himself:

"They have made such progress in the visualization practice, it seems it's not just because of their talent, but also because of their hard work."

Then, Instructor Wang withdrew his gaze.

"Let the lecture begin!"

A voice like a resounding bell echoed in the lecture hall.

Time gradually passed.

"That's all for today. Do you have any questions?"

Instructor Wang's gaze lingered on Ji Bochang and the other three on the stage, as if expecting something.

Sure enough.

Ji Bochang stood up leisurely and said slowly:

"Instructor, I have already mastered the Pure Yuan Qi Gathering Visualization Practice, generated spiritual consciousness, and sensed spiritual energy."

As soon as the voice fell.

The entire lecture hall instantly fell silent, and a pin could be heard dropping.

Immediately afterwards, dozens of gazes mixed with exclamation, envy, and awe were cast on Ji Bochang, who had a calm expression.

At the same time.

Zhang Jing felt an extremely envious gaze suddenly light up beside him, making his scalp tingle.

On the stage.

"Very good!" Instructor Wang showed an expression of 'I knew I didn't misjudge him' and shouted with satisfaction.

He turned to look at Chu Lingyun and the other two:

"Today is already the fifth day, how is your cultivation going?"

"Instructor, in about two days, Lingyun will be able to master the visualization practice. Getting a B grade is no problem," Chu Lingyun smiled.

"I'm only one step away, maybe I can master it tonight," Deng An also said.

"Not bad!"

Instructor Wang praised.

He didn't expect that these four would actually give him a surprise. He originally thought that it would be good if two of them could get a B grade.

At this moment, Instructor Wang no longer hoped for the goal of being in the top three among the many neighboring courtyards. To be precise, after learning about the situation of other neighboring courtyards yesterday, he decisively chose to accept reality.

Because it was impossible.

"Instructor, I... I'm still a little short," Wu Mingyuan's trembling voice sounded.

"I know, just focus on your cultivation," Instructor Wang comforted.

After saying that.

Instructor Wang directly led Ji Bochang away.

Seeing this, the others also left the lecture hall in twos and threes, talking to each other about Ji Bochang's successful breakthrough in the visualization practice, as if they were sharing in his glory.

On the futon.

"As expected of Brother Ji, he's one step ahead of me."

Zhang Jing praised.

Although Ji Bochang had many resources to assist him, this was within the rules of the Dao Academy's assessment, so there was nothing to say.

Moreover, given almost the same conditions, the fact that Ji Bochang could be one step ahead of the other three showed his talent.

"It's time to go back to cultivation, I can't slow down. After I break through the visualization practice, I'll go directly to Instructor Wang, the sooner the better!"

"Where is his residence again?"
