# Chapter 115: I Am the Mountain! (Two-in-One)

"I was wrong, Senior Brother Gu! Rujing shouldn't have listened to Su Huazheng's instigation. Please spare me this once!"

High in the clouds, Si Rujing watched as Gu Yuan approached gracefully and couldn't help but plead for mercy in a coquettish voice.

In the past, as the top disciple of the Ruyi Peak's Qi Condensation realm, when had she ever humbled herself to beg for mercy? But this time, she had no choice.

The young man before her was far too terrifying.

In just ten breaths, he had defeated four of the top experts among the younger generation of the seven noble clans. When she had struck, she was subdued in an instant. Such skill was already far beyond his peers.

She couldn't think of a way to win, and the spiritual energy in the secret realm was crucial to her future. She had no choice but to lower her head.

*Crack!*

But with a mere wave of Gu Yuan's hand, her limbs were broken, and her meridians were flooded with sword energy, making it impossible to gather her magic power. With a pale face, she plummeted from the clouds into the great river below.

Xiao Yi met the same fate.

Thus, the "siege" of Gu Yuan by the seven noble clans came to an abrupt end.

The vast secret realm fell into complete silence.

Bian Chuyao and Feng Anping looked at Gu Yuan with complex expressions, their minds in turmoil, unsure of what to say.

"What a pity. The spiritual energy allocated by the Flowing Cloud Banquet is tied to the tokens and cannot be divided. Otherwise, things wouldn't have needed to be so troublesome..."

But Gu Yuan seemed indifferent, merely sighing as he gazed at the "Azure Sea Tide Qi" above the great river.

"These people have all obtained spiritual energy and have the potential to reach Foundation Establishment. Aren't you afraid of making too many enemies, making it hard to deal with them in the future?"

After a long while, Bian Chuyao finally regained her composure and asked Gu Yuan with a complicated expression.

She had never imagined today would unfold like this.

The malice of the seven noble clans toward commoners was beyond her expectations, and Gu Yuan's overwhelming strength was even more astonishing.

The once-arrogant noble prodigies were no different from ordinary disciples in his hands, crushed effortlessly.

She even suspected that Gu Yuan could have resolved today's conflict without her and Feng Anping.

This "villain" seemed even stronger than before.

She had thought that after consuming the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit, she could surpass him. But now, it seemed she had been too naive.

At the same time, she couldn't help but feel deeply curious about Gu Yuan. How had he achieved this?

But such a sensitive question was not something she could ask outright. She could only worry that his harsh methods today might lead to undesirable consequences.

"People like them can never be friends. You either submit to them or crush them utterly."

"If the methods aren't harsh enough, they won't remember today's lesson."

"Besides... from now on, I will be the mountain myself. Why should I fear them?"

Gu Yuan shook his head, unbothered.

The fact that the Dao Academy had arranged this conflict in the secret realm without restricting methods spoke volumes.

The strong grew stronger, the weak grew weaker, and the winner took all.

As long as he could seize enough spiritual energy, he could build a solid foundation and become a new power within the Dao Academy.

As long as no Golden Core cultivators intervened, Gu Yuan had no fear of six Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Thinking of Golden Core, a gentle smile appeared on his face as he turned to Bian Chuyao and Feng Anping.

"Thank you both for your assistance today. There's no need to worry. Today, the entire secret realm is ours. The Bian and Feng clans will surely be able to nurture more Foundation Establishment cultivators, strengthening your families and increasing your influence!"

Making enemies everywhere was unwise. It was important to have allies.

The Bian and Feng clans were both powerful families. Aligning with them would eliminate many future troubles.

Gu Yuan alone would stand out as a thorn, but with Bian Chuyao and Feng Anping behind him, they would become a mountain—a new faction.

"Senior Brother Gu's skills are unparalleled. Today, my Feng clan has benefited greatly. Naturally, the collection of spiritual energy will be led by you."

Feng Anping was still somewhat dazed.

He had initially followed Bian Chuyao out of curiosity, wanting to see what this commoner prodigy was made of.

After all, he was tired of associating only with noble disciples.

But this encounter had revealed the rise of a true dragon among men.

Not only that, but the spiritual energy in the secret realm could now be freely collected?

It was like stumbling upon a mountaintop while out for a stroll.

But he was no fool. After today, he was more or less tied to Gu Yuan. Since that was the case, he might as well strengthen their relationship.

In the secret realm, Gu Yuan would naturally take the lead.

After all, Gu Yuan was no ordinary Qi Condensation disciple. Once he left the secret realm, he would be a Foundation Establishment cultivator—one with multiple strands of spiritual energy, a mountain in his own right.

Even Golden Core clans would seek to win over such a figure!

"Senior Brother Gu, my Feng clan has a direct descendant, an eight-aperture physique with peerless beauty. Would you be interested in marrying her?"

Thinking this, Feng Anping glanced at Bian Chuyao before speaking up.

Bian Chuyao's expression froze, but she remained silent, waiting for Gu Yuan's response.

"Thank you for your kindness, Junior Brother Feng. But until I achieve the Great Dao, I have no intention of marrying."

Gu Yuan shook his head, his answer firm.

Marrying a noblewoman would bind him too tightly to their interests.

"Then perhaps a concubine?"

"My Feng clan has many women. You may choose freely, with no need for formal status—just let them serve by your side!"

Feng Anping pressed further, lowering his stance even more.

This time, Bian Chuyao couldn't hold back. She interjected, "What use are concubines? If Senior Brother is interested, I can gift you a group of Pearl Maidens, all of exceptional beauty, graceful and loyal..."

She had known Gu Yuan the longest. How could she let someone else gain his favor?

Seeing the two on the verge of arguing, Gu Yuan quickly intervened, "Enough of this. Let's focus on collecting the spiritual energy."

At his words, both immediately fell silent. After some discussion, the three began gathering the energy.

Gu Yuan took the lead, claiming the Azure Sea Tide Qi from the great river. Then, the group swept through the secret realm, harvesting freely.

With no opposition from the seven noble clans, their collection proceeded smoothly.

In less than a day, they had gathered ten strands of spiritual energy.

Gu Yuan took four, while Bian Chuyao and Feng Anping each took three.

All three were delighted and full of enthusiasm.

However, none of the strands were Golden Sword Qi, so Gu Yuan had to patiently continue searching.

"Senior Brother Gu, ahead is the Golden Sun Spirit Peak. There must be spiritual energy there!"

Just then, Bian Chuyao pointed to a golden mountain in the distance.

The Ancient Moon Secret Realm was extraordinary. Each mountain and lake had its own unique spiritual veins, as if dozens of realms had merged into one. The landscape varied dramatically from peak to peak, giving rise to many distinct types of spiritual energy.

The mountain before them radiated golden light, sharp and dazzling—surely the home of Golden Sword Qi.

Gu Yuan was overjoyed and accelerated his flight toward the peak.

But halfway there, he frowned and stopped.

From the other side of the mountain, a young man in black-and-white Daoist robes, his eyes tinged with gray, approached.

Ji Mobai of the Heavenly Pivot Peak!

Of the seven noble clans, he was the only one who hadn't participated in the "siege" against Gu Yuan. Yet, he was the one Gu Yuan feared the most.

During the Flowing Cloud Banquet, Ji Mobai's Heavenly Pivot techniques had suppressed everyone, making it impossible for them to even step onto the platform. His presence alone had dominated the scene.

Gu Yuan couldn't quite gauge his depth.

"Senior Brother Gu!"

But Ji Mobai's attitude was surprisingly amiable. He didn't speak arrogantly. Instead, he bowed slightly and greeted Gu Yuan respectfully.

"I don't deserve such courtesy, Senior Brother Ji."

Gu Yuan narrowed his eyes slightly and returned the gesture.

"Does Senior Brother Gu seek the Great Sun Golden Metal Qi?"

Ji Mobai glanced at Gu Yuan, then at the radiant golden peak behind him, and smiled as he asked.

"Does Senior Brother Ji also wish to claim this energy?"

Gu Yuan countered.

"One strand is enough for Foundation Establishment. But I have a few junior disciples in my peak who are... less talented. As their senior brother, I must look out for them."

Ji Mobai shook his head slightly, as if helpless.

Gu Yuan remained silent, simply watching him calmly.

"But since Senior Brother Gu desires the Great Sun Golden Metal Qi, I naturally won't compete. However, there are a few strands of spiritual energy in the secret realm that I have my eye on. Might Senior Brother be willing to yield?"

"Is this a threat or a bribe, Senior Brother Ji?"

Gu Yuan asked coolly.

Though polite, Ji Mobai's words carried an undercurrent of arrogance. He was not as indifferent as he seemed. His refusal to join Su Huazheng's ambush likely stemmed from this pride.

"Then let us test each other's skills and see if I am worthy of a share of this secret realm!"

With that, Ji Mobai said no more.

Respect had to be earned through strength—especially in the competition for true inheritance.

"Star Spiral!"

Ji Mobai raised his eyes, and a point of starlight spiraled out from his sea of consciousness, streaking toward Gu Yuan.

The starlight was swift, like a true star descending, carrying immense pressure.

"Roar!"

Gu Yuan's spiritual sense surged, and a silver dragon emerged, its massive body writhing as it met the starlight head-on.

With a flick of its tail, the starlight was sent flying, trembling violently.

After absorbing the silver beast-skin book, Gu Yuan's spiritual sense alone was enough to dominate the Qi Condensation realm. The fact that he had suppressed four experts single-handedly earlier was proof of his might.

Ji Mobai's expression shifted slightly, but he remained composed. He pointed to the sky.

"North Star Descends!"

In an instant, mystical starlight fell from the sky above the secret realm, merging with Ji Mobai's spiritual sense.

His spiritual sense swelled as if nourished by a great tonic. The previously dim starlight now shone brilliantly, faintly forming the illusion of stars as it tangled with the silver dragon.

"Interesting..."

Gu Yuan couldn't help but admire.

This was why he had been wary of Ji Mobai.

At merely the Qi Condensation realm, Ji Mobai could already draw upon the power of the stars. This alone placed him far above most cultivators at his level.

Stellar power was vast and boundless, residing high in the heavens—one of the most formidable forces in the world. Yet, harnessing it was incredibly difficult. Without sufficient cultivation, one could only gaze at the stars in vain. To truly connect with them, one needed at least Foundation Establishment.

At the Qi Condensation realm, most could only meditate under the night sky, barely absorbing starlight.

The stellar power Ji Mobai summoned was minuscule, but it was more than enough for Qi Condensation.

His aura surged, his magic power and spiritual sense bolstered by the stars.

For a time, Gu Yuan's dragon-like spiritual sense couldn't overpower him.

"Eleven Techniques of the Heavenly Pivot!"

With his spiritual sense holding firm, Ji Mobai wasted no time. He pointed forward, and a strange seal composed of countless beast spirits flew out, summoning clouds that took the forms of cranes, white tigers, spirit apes, emerald pythons, fire crows, and more—eleven spectral beasts charging at Gu Yuan.

"Four Extremes Seal of Heaven and Earth!"

At the same time, another golden seal engraved with four scenes flew from his dantian, channeling spiritual energy into flames, thunder, gales, and frost—four devastating forces of nature sweeping toward Gu Yuan.

For a moment, it seemed as though the power of the four directions and the souls of all beasts were under his command.

But Gu Yuan merely waved his sleeve, summoning clouds, rain, and peach blossoms in overwhelming waves to meet the onslaught.

In the past, Gu Yuan might have struggled against such prodigies. But after cultivating the Three Methods Heavenly Figure, his magic power had tripled. With the three techniques combined, every seal he cast was devastating. Even the Peach Blossom Sword Seal, once considered mediocre, now unleashed thousands of sword beams, cutting through everything like a tidal wave.

Though the spectral beasts and elemental forces were fierce, they couldn't withstand the relentless assault of the Cloud-Walking Art and Peach Blossom Sword Seal. After a brief stalemate, they were shattered.

Ji Mobai's expression darkened.

He had already held Gu Yuan in high regard, but facing him in battle revealed just how vast his magic power and how formidable his seals truly were.

"Heavenly Pivot Star Formation!"

Seeing the overwhelming counterattack, Ji Mobai sighed and abandoned any thought of victory. He summoned all seven seals from his dantian at once.

Each seal bore the image of a star, arranged in different orientations. As they circled him, they formed a dazzling constellation.

*Buzz!*

The seven seals trembled in unison, and starlight descended once more, forming a mystical barrier around Ji Mobai.

*Clang!*

Countless peach blossom sword beams crashed against the barrier, and the Cloud-Walking Seal enveloped the sky. Yet the star formation remained unshaken, impervious to all attacks.

Seeing this, Gu Yuan hesitated but didn't press further. Instead, he withdrew both seals.

"Senior Brother Ji, I concede."

Gu Yuan clasped his hands behind his back and smiled.

"Senior Brother Gu's skills are extraordinary. I was presumptuous."

Ji Mobai sighed and dispelled the star formation, bowing slightly.

"We are fellow disciples. There's no need for such modesty. That was merely a friendly spar."

"Since we're both in the secret realm, we should support each other. I have need of the Great Sun Golden Metal Qi, so I'll take it. But there are other strands of spiritual energy—please, help yourself."

Gu Yuan returned the bow, then smiled.

Ji Mobai pondered briefly before nodding. "In that case, thank you, Senior Brother Gu!"

"We are fellow disciples. No thanks are necessary."

Gu Yuan smiled faintly.

Ji Mobai was strong. His Heavenly Pivot Star Formation likely had more to it than met the eye. Gu Yuan suspected that without revealing all his cards, he might not be able to defeat him.

But cultivation wasn't just about brute force.

At this stage of the secret realm's trials, there was no need to fight to the death. A slight advantage and mutual respect were enough.

Winning Ji Mobai over and forging goodwill was far more valuable.

The secret realm held twenty strands of spiritual energy, enough to help twenty cultivators reach Foundation Establishment. Even accounting for failures, there would still be over a dozen new Foundation Establishment cultivators!

And all of them—would be his people.

What could a few noble clans possibly do against him?
