# Chapter 30: Dao Zong Bi Sheng

Xu Yunfan released Li Miaojun upon hearing this, tossing her to the side. After confirming she had no ability to move, he quickly walked over to Li Haomiao. Looking at the wound that had pierced through his chest, he couldn't help but click his tongue in astonishment.

"You're still alive after that?"

Li Haomiao rolled his eyes.

"Can't you say something nice?"

He paused, then lowered his voice and said, "Thank you. If it weren't for you, I would have had no way out."

Xu Yunfan waved his hand. "That's not necessary. I only took action because I saw that woman was like a strong bow at the end of its arrow. If she had been in peak condition, you would have had to fend for yourself."

That woman's strength was too formidable. Having cultivated a single strand of qi through the External Three Unifications, she could rival the Blood Refinement Realm. Meanwhile, he was merely at the Great Completion of the First Practice.

He couldn't defeat her; he absolutely couldn't.

Most importantly, Li Miaojun's final words had stopped him. If Li Haomiao couldn't hold her off, then he and Fang Mushan would both die.

As for Fang Mushan, Xu Yunfan glanced at him not far away, stuck in the snow. When Xu Yunfan had exerted his strength, Fang Mushan had exerted the most, but he had accidentally sunk deep into the snowdrift. Even now, after the battle had ended, he was still struggling and couldn't climb out.

Upon hearing this, Li Haomiao slowly closed his eyes.

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly. Seeing Li Haomiao motionless, he reached out and touched Li Haomiao's stomach.

Li Haomiao opened his eyes. "What are you doing?"

"I want to cut open your belly and see if there's any good stuff inside."

"..."

Li Haomiao barely managed to raise his hand and place it on Xu Yunfan's shoulder.

"I think I'm burning out."

Xu Yunfan's face turned anxious. "Don't die yet! Pass on the Rising Sun One Qi Jue to me first!"

"..."

Li Haomiao wanted to curse, but he couldn't summon any strength. He just stared, regulating his breath, afraid that if he lost control of his heart, blood would spray from his wound.

An ordinary person would have died long ago from such a severe injury to the heart. However, having achieved great completion in sinew, bone, and skin, and completing the External Three Unifications to step into the Muscle Refinement Realm, one could achieve preliminary control over their body's muscles.

In this situation, as a master of the Muscle Refinement Realm, he possessed extremely formidable vitality.

But the injury to his heart was still extremely severe. If not for that one Pill of Dragon and Tiger Great Elixir, Li Haomiao would have lost his breath long ago.

He was already at the end of his last breath.

"You shouldn't provoke him anymore. If his emotions get even slightly agitated, he might really die," a slightly aged voice suddenly sounded behind Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan shivered, lowered his head, and crouched, shooting forward almost贴着 the ground. He didn't stop until he had窜出 more than ten meters.

He turned back and saw a pale, white-haired, aged face right in front of him.

Xu Yunfan's scalp went numb, his heart clenched tightly, and a chill shot from his spine straight to the top of his head.

His legs seemed to spring up as if on a spring. He instantly settled into a horse stance, his knees slightly扣 inward, like an old tree taking root, firmly钉 into the ground. His waist was like a powerful torsion spring poised to strike, quickly twisting, driving the strength of his entire upper body upward along his spine.

His back muscles bulged high, like two hard small mountains. Every muscle was tensed to the extreme, as if trying to squeeze all the strength from his body out in one go.

Then, his shoulders sank, his arms tensed like iron. His biceps and triceps worked together, driving his fist forward like a heavy hammer.

This punch carried a whistowing wind, accompanied by the sound of破风.

He was confident that even if it were a stone in front of him, this punch could shatter it to pieces.

In the next instant, his pupils trembled violently. He saw a palm cover his fist, and the force he unleashed was like mud cattle entering the sea, not raising a single wave.

Then, he saw this hand like a golden snake coiling around silk, wrapping around his arm and pressing down on several points around his body.

Before Xu Yunfan could react, the large face quickly retreated, arriving at Li Haomiao's side in the blink of an eye.

Xu Yunfan was stunned for a moment. He focused his gaze and saw an old Taoist priest in a green robe suddenly appear.

This old Taoist was extremely tall, standing over two meters. His body was as thin as dried branches, and he exuded an indescribably strange aura, truly resembling the legendary slender ghost shadow, making one's heart fill with coldness.

The old Taoist kept muttering, his voice low and hoarse: "The aptitude is too poor. The only true blood seems to have been completely consumed in the cultivation of the Red Refining Copper Body Cloak Hammer."

As he spoke, he slowly crouched down, his fingers like nimble phantoms, quickly tapping several points on Li Haomiao's body.

Miraculously, Li Haomiao's originally pale-as-paper face instantly turned rosy, as if infused with vibrant life.

The old Taoist looked heartbroken. He carefully took out a pill from his怀里, then slapped Li Haomiao twice with a look of disappointment, cursing without good temper: "You wastrel, the foundation of our Dao Sect is almost completely squandered by you."

Li Haomiao slowly opened his eyes. Seeing the old Taoist before him, a trace of guilt immediately appeared in his expression. He stammered, "Master, I was wrong. I shouldn't have trusted others easily and left the mountain on my own back then."

A master from the Dao Sect?!

The tension in Xu Yunfan's heart finally slowly relaxed.

Along the way, he had inquired a lot about the Dao Sect. He only knew it was the number one sect in the Daoist path of the Great Zhou Empire, filled with高手 and mysterious. Even through indirect questioning, he couldn't get much useful information.

Just then, Fang Mushan finally managed to climb out of the snow pit.

His face was flushed red, full of guilt. "Sorry, I didn't charge forward to the front in time."

"It's fine. Your determination to enter the battle wasn't any less than mine, you were just unlucky," Xu Yunfan comforted him.

As the two were talking, Li Haomiao took the pill and pointed at Xu Yunfan, who was ten meters away, muttering something in a low voice.

The old Taoist shook his head slightly and only said one sentence, which Xu Yunfan couldn't hear clearly.

The moment the old Taoist finished speaking, Li Haomiao's eyes widened, and his voice rose considerably: "Master, you must have seen it wrong. He learned the Red Refining Copper Body Cloak Hammer as soon as he tried it, understanding it instantly. How can you call him a mediocrity?!"

The old Taoist's expression was calm, his tone certain: "There is no trace of true blood in his body. This technique has likely already consumed all his true blood, and his aptitude is too average. Even our Dao Sect's entry-level martial arts will likely take him decades to master."

He paused, then added indifferently: "Though true blood bearers aren't numerous in the world, they aren't rare either. Being able to activate that single strand of true blood within one's body is already a gift of great fortune. Taking him to the Dao Sect would be meaningless, it would only add to his troubles."

Upon hearing this, Li Haomiao was stunned for a moment, then looked at Xu Yunfan with deep guilt. "It's because of me that I've harmed him."

He paused, then continued, "I promised him an external true art of the External Three Unifications, Master..."

"True art?"

The old Taoist's brow furrowed instantly, and he glanced at Xu Yunfan with displeasure, his gaze full of dissatisfaction.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but raise his eyebrows, a strange discomfort rising in his heart. He secretly cursed, *This old bastard...*

Then, Li Haomiao said a few more words.
