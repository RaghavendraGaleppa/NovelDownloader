Chapter 175: Inner World, Who Killed Her

You undergo a Yin-Yang medicinal bath, absorbing the effects of the medicine. Your muscles and bones become strong, and you gain a deeper understanding of the principles of Yin and Yang. Proficiency in Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword +398.

You bathe and swim together. Proficiency in Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword +415.

Madam Wen said, "You are still young, and your pure Yang essence is not yet full. Your bones have not yet fully set. Although you have tempered a good physique, it is all through your own exploration without any systematic method. If you were to encounter a true genius, your foundation would inevitably be weak."

"Xiao Xian, from today onwards, you shall be my sword-bearing man. The position of commander can be handed over to that Ding... It doesn't matter who, I dare say they wouldn't dare to make a fuss."

"Let me help you temper a good physique and build a solid foundation. Don't you like that?"

Madam Wen saw that Li Xian's expression was complicated.

Li Xian thought to himself, "Having received such great kindness, I will eventually have to repay it. Madam, oh Madam... this puts me in a difficult position." He wasn't afraid of being schemed against for profit, but he was afraid of genuine sincerity.

Li Xian said, "Li Xian is flattered."

Madam Wen smiled. "You should be flattered. Do you think I, Wen Caitang, am someone anyone can get close to? You are the first. From now on, you only need to remember this: my kindness, you accept it. My words, you listen to them."

Madam Wen's hand gently caressed Li Xian's face, then gradually moved down, gripping his wrist bone and applying slight pressure to meticulously test his physique. "In this world, only the scions of great clans have access to personalized body-forging methods."

"A martial artist's... body is the foundation. The so-called first and second realms of the martial path are nothing but building a skyscraper upon a foundation. The martial artists of Qingning County, and even the entire Poor Heaven Prefecture, lose precisely because their vision is shallow."

"They do not know what a foundation is, nor how to forge one. Let me reveal something to you: why do you think martial artists can achieve longevity?"

Li Xian replied, "By consuming the essence of heaven and earth and digesting it, thus they can live long."

"That is merely the surface," Madam Wen said, pressing down on Li Xian's shoulder and giving it a light squeeze. She revealed a look of surprise. "Your natural talent for physique is exceptionally strong."

"Nothing in the heavens and earth is truly everlasting. Dynasties will fall, and martial arts will be lost. Yet, martial artists insist on lasting forever. Tell me... how would they achieve this?"

An idea struck Li Xian. "Nothing in the heavens and earth is everlasting. But the heavens and earth themselves are truly everlasting!"

"Eh?" Madam Wen was just about to say this. She said, "You're being quite clever now. Not bad... A formidable martial artist's standing place is like a small world of its own."

"Flesh and blood form the forests, bones become the mountains, and the internal Qi of a person has infinite wonders. It grows from within this inner world, gathering to form lakes and seas."

"Since you are so clever, let me test you. Where do you think the foundation I speak of lies?"

Madam Wen gently parted the water and swam to the edge of the bath pool. Li Xian also swam over. Unconsciously, the relationship between the two had changed from the ordinary.

Li Xian came to the Madam's side, peeled a fruit, and fed it to her. He fell into a pensive state and said, "I truly do not know. Please enlighten me, Madam."

"I'll give you a hint. Try guessing again," Madam Wen said, also peeling a fruit and feeding it to Li Xian. She swam to the other side, saying as she swam, "You have never left Qingning. The heavens and earth you have seen are only this big."

"But the heavens and earth are vast and boundless."

"Do you remember the patterns on the Sky-Containing Box? What shape is the lid?"

Li Xian chased after her and replied, "It is round."

Madam Wen asked, "And the body of the box?" Li Xian answered, "It is square."

"What do the square and round represent?" Madam Wen swam to the pool's edge and stopped. Li Xian caught up and naturally put his arm around her. After a moment of thought, he said, "I know this one. It represents the round heavens and the square earth."

"Correct," Madam Wen said, gently slapping the water's surface.

Ripples spread, and water droplets were pulled from the pool, turning into mist. They eventually condensed into a mass about ten feet high. Looking up, it looked just like the sky.

Li Xian marveled at the strange scene before him. He was even more amazed by the Madam's strength. The application of this internal Qi was truly difficult to describe in words.

Madam Wen said, "The mist is the sky, the pool water is the earth. It is just like the world we live in. And in this world of ours, there stand several... high mountains."

She used her Qi to adhere to the water, raising seven water pillars. They connected heaven and earth. Although they were just manifestations, in a daze, they possessed a majestic and magnificent aura.

The water pillars stood proudly, supporting the sky.

"The one closest to us is named 'Su Mountain.' It is infinitely high and endlessly vast. A true hero, a real man, should always take a journey there. This mountain hides infinite dangers and nurtures countless treasures."

Madam Wen gave a light tap. The mist dissipated, and the water pillars fell. She asked, "After saying all this, what do you think the martial foundation refers to? Do you have a guess?"

Li Xian pondered for a moment. "Madam, are you perhaps referring to the spine?"

"If a martial artist forms a world of their own, the spine should be 'Su Mountain,' supporting the heavens and the earth, enduring since ancient times."

Madam Wen clapped her hands in praise. "Good, good, Xiao Xian, you are very clever."

Li Xian suddenly understood. Xu Lifeng had some connection with the Madam, and his family's forces must not be weak. And the basic martial arts of the Leopard Blade Sect were related to the "spine." It was likely meant for descendants to build a solid foundation, but Xu Lifeng's inheritance was incomplete, so he didn't know its importance.

"Indeed," Madam Wen said. "You have already entered the Food of Essence realm. You should know that consuming essence treasures does not directly strengthen bones and muscles. It mostly makes your body's tendencies align with the heavens and the earth. Although a Food of Essence martial artist's vitality and strength are indeed superior to those of a mortal clay body, that is merely a byproduct. Brute force is not worth mentioning."

"From now on... I will focus on tempering your physique. Your strength, stamina... all aspects will reach a new level. But the true foundation lies in your spine. When your spine possesses the imposing manner of a towering mountain, and you then execute martial arts, the external phenomena will be more intense, and your strength will be greater, because you will have already propped open the world around your body."

Hearing this, Li Xian felt the vastness of the martial path. Why one must comprehend the heavens and the earth, why one must consume essence to shed the mortal coil... there are reasons behind it all. But people of later generations only know how to imitate, not the true meaning. They unknowingly walk the wrong path, leading to a sudden stop in their progress, making further advancement impossible.

A good teacher is hard to find.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, if a martial artist's spine is broken, wouldn't they be废废 (crippled)?"

"Not necessarily," Madam Wen shook her head. "The spine is also a matter of will and spirit. If the spine is broken, the will and spirit can still hold it up. Moreover, a martial artist's actual circumstances, situations, and fortuitous encounters are all different. How can they be treated as one and the same?"

"And the martial path is vast, with few certainties. Various theories, true and false, are interwoven. There was once a theory that claimed all things in the heavens and earth form their own worlds, and by understanding this, one could manipulate objects from thin air."

At this time, the medicinal effects in the pool had all been absorbed. Madam Wen said, "What I have told you today is merely the tip of the iceberg. Do not overthink it, lest distracting thoughts disturb your mind, which is harmful and not beneficial. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will surely explain it to you."

"Rest well. Tomorrow at the chen hour (7-9 a.m.), meet me in the inner courtyard."

Water dripped.

Madam Wen left the pool.

Li Xian put on his clothes and combed his long hair. He looked at the bronze mirror and fixed his appearance, seeing his handsome features. He was quite satisfied and also left the inner courtyard. On the way, he felt as if something was missing...

Returning to the Commander's Courtyard. Li Xian was full of energy and vitality. He held his sword and practiced,舞舞 (wielding) the "Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword" with exquisite perfection. The Yin-Yang intersection's essence from his bath with the Madam earlier still remained.

Within the swordplay's ferocity, there were hints of softness.

Li Xian's interest suddenly rose. He thrust his sword out, aiming at a jujube tree in the courtyard, using the move "The Sea withers and the Rocks rot." This move comes from the second level of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword. Li Xian had perfected the first level, but the second level was only just proficient. The transition between the two layers of swordplay was not yet seamless.

This "The Sea withers and the Rocks rot" requires the two layers to be used in conjunction. When it hit the jujube tree, the tree's leaves turned yellow and withered, falling in a flurry, decaying at an astonishing speed.

The power was immense.

But once the essence of the Yin-Yang intersection dissipated, Li Xian could no longer execute this "The Sea withers and the Rocks rot."

He sheathed his sword.

Suddenly, he was stunned. His palm was intact. Today, the Madam did not stab his palm.

"The Madam's schemes are deep, but after today, she treats me differently. What is our relationship now? She has shown me kindness, regardless of whether it was feigned affection or a sinister plot. She did save me. This matter... is truly a headache."

Li Xian simply stopped thinking about it, closed his eyes, and went to sleep. The next day, at the chen hour, he went as promised and waited in front of the Madam's room.

The Madam said, "Xiao Xian, come in."

He pushed the door and entered, seeing the Madam's boudoir. The area was not large, nor was it extravagantly decorated. But a bedroom is a place for rest; no matter how large or wide, one can only lie on a space of about ten feet. In fact, this kind of bedroom is the most suitable in size.

Madam Wen sat at her dressing table and said, "Comb my hair." Qiu Yue had betrayed the manor, so daily affairs naturally fell to Li Xian.

Li Xian's "Soaring Cloud Hand" had already reached its peak, and he had grasped the "Exquisite Hand" trait. His fingers were long and nimble, parting and braiding the long hair. At first, he didn't get the hang of it, but after the Madam gave a couple of pointers and told him how to braid, he became more and more skilled.

He was even better than Qiu Yue.

Madam Wen was satisfied. The reason she had chosen Qiu Yue as a servant back then was because she saw that her hand bones were remarkable, and she had considerable talent in细致 (delicate) tasks like palm techniques and embroidery. Unfortunately, Qiu Yue's talent in martial arts was mediocre, and she was not of great use.

If only she could circulate her Qi through the heavens and earth, solidify her blood, and close her pores, cleansing her innate nature, she would have no trouble catching the Madam's eye.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, what will we do next..."

Madam Wen nodded. "You will come with me out of the manor to see that Qiu Yue. What difficulty could she have that she had to leave without saying goodbye?" She did not prepare a carriage.

It was already autumn, with a continuous autumn rain.

"If the Madam can even find Qiu Yue's corpse, that would be too terrifying," Li Xian thought. He said nothing and silently followed behind her.

The scenery along the way was breathtakingly beautiful. Madam Wen walked to a certain mountain path, frowned, and turned into the mountains. Li Xian's heart gave a jolt, feeling a strong sense of familiarity with the mountain path.

It was precisely the mountain path they had taken when they exterminated the Flower Cage Sect. Li Xian was惊疑 (astonished and suspicious). "Strange, strange. What method does the Madam use to be able to find this place so accurately?"

Passing by the abandoned house, Madam Wen only glanced at it and said, "There was a chaotic battle here once."

Li Xian said, "To be honest with the Madam, a few days ago, there was a group of Flower Cage Sect bandits here. I led the men and wiped them out."

"Oh?" Madam Wen said, "The Flower Cage Sect bandits have always been cunning, with three burrows like a crafty rabbit. They are as slippery as loaches and hard to catch. For you to be able to wipe them out, that is very good."

Madam Wen didn't pay it much mind, bypassed the abandoned house, and continued deeper into the mountains. Li Xian had known at the time that Qiu Yue had betrayed him, so he had pulled her far away to talk. That's why they were quite far from the abandoned house.

Later, he fed Qiu Yue poison and killed her. Then he found an open area and buried her body.

Madam Wen found that spot and said, "Ah! So she died. She died right here."

Li Xian felt a chill down his spine. To be able to accurately find a dead body in the deep mountains... Such a method is truly frightening.

"The Madam's actions are also meant to intimidate me," Li Xian realized. He dug up Qiu Yue's corpse.

Madam Wen showed neither pity nor sadness. She pointed at Qiu Yue's corpse and asked, "What do you think? Who killed her?"
