# Chapter 315: The Master of Glazed City and the Final Completion

Wangcai was a person, while Wanghu was a dog.

Wangcai was Wanghu's master, but just three hours ago, Wanghu had lost its owner.

At that time, the man and his dog arrived at Glazed City. The master instructed the dog to stay put and keep watch while he sneaked into the city alone, intending to steal some valuable treasures.
