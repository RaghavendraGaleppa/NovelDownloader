# Chapter 33: Western Cave No. 23

"Hey, junior brother, what are you spacing out for?"

Zhang Jing was still gazing at Senior Brother Yangchu's retreating figure when he suddenly felt a heavy pat on his back, followed by Senior Sister Tong's voice in his ear.

"Hiss—"

He couldn't help but suck in a sharp breath through clenched teeth.

He'd noticed earlier—this senior sister's hand strength was completely disproportionate to her petite frame, as if they were two extremes.

"Senior Sister Tong, is there something you need?"

Zhang Jing quickly turned around, slightly lowering his head to look at her, afraid she might deliver another slap.

"Ahem, junior brother," facing Zhang Jing's gaze, Tong Yao's delicate face flushed slightly before she clasped her hands behind her back and asked with a serious expression, "What's your relationship with Senior Brother Yangchu? You both share the surname Zhang."

That's it?

Zhang Jing's heart twitched inexplicably.

Seeing the serious expression on her face, he'd thought she was going to say something important.

He gave her a strange look before answering without hesitation:

"Senior sister, it's just a coincidence."

"Oh—"

Tong Yao drew out the syllable, pretending to be profound. "Senior sister understands. Since we have time now, let me briefly introduce you to the Luodu Squad."

"Please go ahead, senior sister." Zhang Jing's attention immediately sharpened.

"Our squad ranks third among the outer courtyard teams. Above us, there's one captain and five vice-captains, all at the tenth level of Qi Refinement."

After a pause, she continued:

"Below them are seventeen managers, with cultivation levels no lower than the seventh level of Qi Refinement. Senior Brother Yangchu from earlier is one of these seventeen managers. Below the managers are ordinary members like us."

Senior Brother Yangchu, a manager, at least seventh level Qi Refinement?

Zhang Jing suddenly recalled the powerful auras he'd sensed when arriving on the island—none were weaker than Senior Brother Yangchu, yet their numbers didn't match what the senior sister said.

If that's the case—

Zhang Jing fell into thought.

Remembering that this senior sister had just returned from a mission, he asked curiously:

"Senior sister, how does one typically accept demon suppression missions? Do we go together as a group?"

"Well, it depends."

Senior Sister Tong thought for a moment before answering slowly:

"For some lower-level missions, a few people can team up to accept them. The merit rewards are then distributed according to each person's contribution during the mission."

"As for higher-level missions, they require managers or the captain to lead. Of course, they take the lion's share of rewards, but we can obtain large amounts of demon corpses, rare treasures, and other resources. The overall gains are much higher than lower-level missions, though they're more dangerous."

"Also, if one reaches the fourth level of Qi Refinement or above, the squad allows us to accept missions alone. Doing missions alone naturally yields greater rewards. However, this method requires extremely high overall capability. Currently in our Luodu Squad, only nine senior brothers are accustomed to working alone."

"Senior sister, how much merit does an ordinary lower-level mission reward?" Zhang Jing continued asking.

"Between fifty to eighty."

Senior Sister Tong answered straightforwardly.

"And how long does it usually take to complete one mission?"

"If things go smoothly, just over ten days. If not... it's hard to say—could take several months."

Huh—is that so?

Zhang Jing couldn't help but ponder silently.

Given his current strength limited to lower-level missions, teaming up seemed too inefficient. If he undertook demon suppression missions alone, relying on the Five Elements Spirit River and various special spells, he could probably handle them.

But—

The speed of earning merit was still too slow.

If he didn't want to delay his cultivation, he might only complete three to five missions a year. The merit gained might seem substantial to others, but compared to Zhang Jing's goals, it was merely a drop in the bucket.

Not to mention the fourth-level Qi Refinement restriction.

After much deliberation, Zhang Jing concluded that Senior Brother Liu was right—it would indeed be difficult to accumulate enough merit for a top-grade inheritance through missions alone.

His hopes would have to lie in talisman-making.

This was the inspiration Zhang Jing had gained from his previous conversation with Senior Brother Qiu.

Compared to pursuits like alchemy, artifact forging, and formation setting, talisman-making had lower costs, making it more suitable for impoverished cultivators like Zhang Jing. More importantly, the process was relatively time-efficient, allowing him to grind skill proficiency.

With this in mind, Zhang Jing had already made his decision.

Snapping back to the present.

He cupped his hands and bid farewell:

"Thank you for your guidance, senior sister. I'll first return to settle into my cave abode and visit another day."

"Go ahead," Senior Sister Tong waved her hand with a smile, then seemed to remember something and reminded him: "Junior brother, after we've selected a mission, I'll come notify you."

"Understood, senior sister. You carry on."

With that.

Zhang Jing turned and walked out.

Yet before he could exit, he heard a curious voice from behind: "Oh right, junior brother, I forgot to ask—how exactly did you cultivate? That's an A-grade monstrous talent we're talking about. The Dao Academy might not see one in decades, yet you're only slightly inferior?"

"Senior sister, I just cultivated normally."

Zhang Jing answered, unconsciously quickening his pace.

After putting considerable distance between himself and the Merit Tower.

He finally exhaled in relief and retrieved the jade key from his spirit pendant space, sending his spiritual sense into it.

Instantly, a specific location to his left front became faintly perceptible.

Holding the jade key.

Zhang Jing swiftly headed toward the sensed location.

Half an hour later.

A bronze door enveloped in spiritual light appeared before Zhang Jing, emanating intense spiritual energy fluctuations.

Upon it was inscribed: 'Western Cave No. 23'!

The bronze door was connected to a delicate small mountain lush with greenery, where the cries of birds and monkeys occasionally sounded. Before the door lay a crystal-clear small lake, shrouded by woods.

Zhang Jing's eyes brightened.

Nestled between mountain and water, abundant in spiritual energy, vibrant with life.

Truly an excellent location—no wonder a cultivation cave was built here!

He walked straight to the bronze door, channeled spiritual power into the jade key, then pressed it against the door.

In an instant, the jade key emitted a faint glow.

Boom—

The bronze door slowly opened, the spiritual light covering it rippling like water.

Suppressing his excitement.

Zhang Jing stepped into the cave.

The moment he entered, he was engulfed by a swarm of spiritual mist.

The spiritual energy inside the cave was so dense it had condensed into wispy fog.

A sound like roaring river waves faintly echoed within Zhang Jing's body—his Five Organs Liberation Water Origin Commentary had spontaneously activated under the influence of the rich spiritual energy.

An endless stream of spiritual power merged into his dantian.

In just an instant, he felt his cultivation strengthen slightly.

The absurdly dense spiritual energy in the cave left Zhang Jing staring wide-eyed.

Before coming, he'd imagined the cave's spiritual energy would be abundant, but never had he expected it to reach such unimaginable levels.

Comparing the Longze Market's cultivation chambers to this... wait, why compare?

Zhang Jing had never heard of any cultivation chambers.

After briefly touring the cave, Zhang Jing discovered it wasn't just the spiritual energy that was impressive—the space was absurdly large.

It even had areas designated for raising spirit plants and spirit beasts.

Cultivation chambers, inheritance chambers, and all sorts of functional rooms were fully equipped, embodying sheer extravagance—'might not use it, but must have it'!

Zhang Jing quickly unpacked all his belongings, organizing them properly.

Then he eagerly entered the cultivation chamber.

Before long.

A low draconic roar faintly reverberated.

The dense spiritual energy in the cave surged toward the cultivation chamber like tidal waves, while spiritual energy from the earth's veins continuously replenished the cave.

The next day.

Zhang Jing emerged from the cultivation chamber, thoroughly satisfied.

After a night of cultivation, his strength had advanced another small but firm step.

At this rate.

Within two months, his cultivation would naturally reach the third level of Qi Refinement.

Since his cultivation progress far exceeded expectations, it was time to prioritize the talisman-making inheritance.

With this thought.

Zhang Jing took out the mid-grade inheritance exchange voucher, examined it briefly, then turned to head out.
