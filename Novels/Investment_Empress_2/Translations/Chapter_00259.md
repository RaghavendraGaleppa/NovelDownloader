# Chapter 259: The Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan, Ice Cube? The Yingjiao Clan's Auditions!

The territory of the Yingjiao Clan.

Located in the center of the Black Water Marsh, this place was originally known as the Black Water Plains. It wasn't until the Yingjiao Clan migrated here that it rained year-round, gradually turning it into the wetland it is today.

Above the water's surface stood rows of pavilions and towers. If not for the unusually large scale of the architecture, one might momentarily mistake it for the Jiangnan region.

The Yingjiao Clan were cultured demons who had studied in the Central Divine Continent, quite different from those rustic bumpkins.

Today, the clan territory was bustling with activity.

All the water tribes connected to the Yingjiao Clan throughout the Black Water Marsh had gathered here, for today was the day of the Yingjiao Clan's selection tournament to vie for the Divine Jade.

As everyone knew, the Yingjiao Clan were the masters of the Black Water Marsh, and they were the only clan qualified to enter the Floating Monastery.

By the lakeside, a banquet was laid out.

Water tribes from all over were exchanging toasts amidst the crowd, the demonic voices clamoring, making the scene extraordinarily lively.

One could see crab clans walking sideways, shrimp clans with shrimp heads, river clam clans sitting in their shells, and...

A foreign dragon riding a human as a mount?

This Yingjiao Clan member was actually sitting on a human's shoulder!

Moreover, his transformation was quite thorough, with only a few physical traits remaining.

"Where are Mom and Dad?" Mu Rongxiao asked curiously, looking around.

"Our clansmen are sitting in the inner seats," Wu Dameng pointed to the pavilions in the center of the lake.

Members of the Yingjiao Clan, along with some powerful Great Demons, had seats in the pavilions closer to the lake's center.

Those small demons who were just here to watch the excitement were seated at the outer banquet.

As the few of them passed by, they drew curious gazes from many demons and overheard various discussions.

"Shrimp Boss, why didn't you bring your son this time?"

"Don't even mention it. On the way here with me, my son was snatched away by a bird demon. Now, in my line, I'm the only shrimp-headed man left."

"Alas, those bird demons are simply too bullying!"

"Who made it so that the last time a Divine Jade fell from the heavens, the Great Peng Clan snatched it? It's not certain it'll end up in the hands of us water tribes this time either."

"What do you mean by that?"

"Don't you know the Azure Luan Clan has produced a Divine Maiden?"

...

The Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan...

A wave of relief washed over Li Mo, but his thoughts couldn't help but drift.

He couldn't help but picture Ice Cube, her back sprouting wings, soaring through the heavens. Her gaze was clear and spirited, and when she looked over, her frost-like jade face would show a hint of softness. She would extend a fair hand to him, taking him along to fly up to the blue sky...

She would definitely go to the Floating Monastery.

"Brother Li," Huang Donglai's voice interrupted Li Mo's thoughts.

"Hm?"

"My hair is about to be pulled out by you."

"...My apologies, I've wronged you, Brother Huang. I'll make it up to you afterward."

Li Mo cleared his throat lightly.

They passed through to the inner seats without obstruction. The sight before them was filled with various members of the Yingjiao Clan, along with many Great Demons with fierce and powerful auras.

Among this group of demons, the few of them were not particularly eye-catching.

Mu Rongxiao's gaze had been scanning the crowd, but he had yet to find the parents he longed for.

"This is Wu Mo, who has returned to our clan from outside the Southern Frontier. Brother Mo," Wu Dameng introduced him to a few familiar clansmen.

"Oh? We have clansmen outside the Southern Frontier?"

"And the one next to him..."

"Oh, that is Brother Mo's mount."

"Hisss! To be so fierce?"

The few Yingjiao expressions showed shock, and they immediately offered a few words of flattery.

Afterward, they went back to eating, drinking, and chatting among themselves.

"Have you all heard of that Divine Maiden from the Azure Luan Clan?"

"Rumor has it that not only is her Azure Luan bloodline incredibly pure, but she also possesses the bloodline of a Divine Phoenix?"

"It should be true. Even the young clan leader of the Xiangliu Clan suffered a great loss at her hands, losing one of his heads."

"Ah? Even the Celestial Dragon of our clan isn't necessarily a match for the young clan leader of the Xiangliu."

The ordinary dragons at the table all expressed concern for the future of the Yingjiao Clan in their conversation.

After all, whether it's the Great Peng or the Azure Luan, all bird demons are inherently displeased with the Yingjiao Clan.

"Brother Mo, what do you think?" Wu Dameng couldn't help but ask.

"I don't just watch."

"???"

"Just watching won't do. I also have to make a move. I reckon she won't be able to resist."

---

Li Mo said this with a calm expression.

"Brother Mo has such spirit, to contend with that Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan?"

The dragons present couldn't help but gasp, making the humid air feel a few degrees drier.

This is more than just contending.

Listen, he even wants to make the Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan unable to resist!

Is this the courage of a dragon that has crossed the river? Is it confidence or arrogance...

"Hmph, knows nothing of the world's depths." x2

From a seat not far away, a gloomy youth who exuded a faint foul odor and originally had three heads let out a cold snort.

From the fact that he now only had two heads, one could discern his identity.

The Xiangliu Clan.

Among disaster beasts, the Xiangliu's reputation far surpasses that of the Yingjiao, and they are individually much stronger.

Unfortunately, the Xiangliu Clan is extremely difficult to reproduce, always having a single lineage, with a very small clan population.

Otherwise, who truly rules the Black Water Marsh would be uncertain.

"He even wants the Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan to be completely unable to resist?"

"He has no idea how terrifying she is!"

The youth's two heads, one had a gloomy expression, the other was burning with rage.

"Young Master, this is the Yingjiao Clan's territory."

A shrimp-headed attendant beside him quickly advised:

"Once he sees your true form's divine ability later, he'll naturally know how weak and pathetic he is."

Only then did the two-headed youth stop with a cold snort.

At the same time.

Not far away, Mu Rongxiao's gaze fixed.

The elders of the Yingjiao Clan, amidst the congratulations of the many water tribes, walked out. Among them was a couple. The woman had dragon horns on her head, but other than that, her attire made her look like an ordinary young lady from a human noble family.

Beside her was a man with long whiskers垂 chest, a refined and elegant demeanor, and a face seven-tenths similar to Mu Rongxiao's.

The Yingjiao Clan elders took their seats on the stone platform in front of the venue.

"..."

Li Mo felt a sense of déjà vu, as if he were watching the judges enter for a talent show.

Soon, he realized this was no illusion.

The woman walked across the water to the center of the lake.

She announced in a clear voice:

"The water tribes of our Black Water Marsh have always been closely connected. I believe you all have some idea why we have gathered everyone here today."

"That's right. We are here to select five water tribes, with both bloodline and strength being top-tier, to go to the Floating Monastery."

"This is not just for the sake of our Yingjiao Clan, but for the entire Black Water Marsh!"

"To restore the glory of the Black Water, it is our duty!"

"In this audition, even if you are only an ordinary demon, you still have the opportunity to bring glory to the water tribes!"

*Whoosh—*

The crowd of demons erupted in an uproar, each one excited and fanatical.

This represented that they all had a chance to go to the Floating Monastery.

"..."

Little Li felt his impression of the Yingjiao Clan being overturned.

Weren't they supposed to be terrifying disaster beasts?

He had previously heard that Mu Rongxiao's parents were being coerced, and he thought it was because human-demon romance was forbidden by natural laws, only to find out they were being urged to have a second child.

He had previously heard that the Yingjiao Clan's internal situation was complex when selecting candidates for the Floating Monastery, and he thought there would be intricate schemes and covert struggles.

It turns out it's a talent show?!

Was he judging the demons by human standards?

"Brother Li, it's actually quite normal."

"Hm?"

"Think about it, demons are inherently stronger than humans. If they were also scheming, would they have been driven to the Southern Frontier?"

"...Makes sense."

Li Mo nodded, but he still had some doubts.

"Why is it called an audition?"

"Because from this lake, if you follow the main current downstream, that leads to the South Sea. Didn't you know that, Brother Mo?" Wu Dameng explained, looking at Li Mo with sympathy.

Poor Brother Mo, who has been separated from his clan. He's so pitiful he's never even seen the sea.
