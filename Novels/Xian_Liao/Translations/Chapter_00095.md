# Chapter 95: Magical Artifacts  

"Divine Wind Leg Technique (Proficient)."  

Zhou Qing observed the evaluation within his Health Preservation Interface and felt deeply gratified. When his Divine Wind Leg Technique reached the proficient level, he even sensed an indescribable relaxation throughout his muscles and bones. Considering his current level of physical refinement, achieving such a sensation indicated that the technique had significantly enhanced his entire skeletal and muscular structure.  

Whoosh!  

The north wind howled.  

Zhou Qing's blood and qi surged like a blazing furnace, warming the entire courtyard. After sustaining this for nearly half an hour, he calmed his qi and blood. The courtyard quickly returned to its bone-chilling cold.  

"Human strength can only temporarily resist the might of nature. The power of heaven is infinite, while human strength has its limits," Zhou Qing murmured with a light sigh.  

Yet, the mere ability to alter local weather with his qi and blood alone brought him ever closer to the realm of immortals and deities. Despite his usual composure, he couldn't help but feel a flicker of pride.  

After a brief adjustment, Zhou Qing stepped into the medicinal garden.  

The winter snow and wind had no effect on the Great Mulberry Tree. In fact, the colder the weather, the more abundant the spiritual energy in the surroundings.  

Currently, the spirit-gathering array in the courtyard was powered by the demon crane's inner core, leaving the one at Qingfu Palace without such a resource.  

Strangely, the Great Mulberry Tree seemed to grow even more fiery amid the winter storms. Fortunately, the vermilion fruit plants in the courtyard absorbed this fiery energy. Zhou Qing understood that this was the tree's yin giving rise to yang—the fiery energy was the spark of yang within yin, naturally manifesting in the winter cold.  

To Zhou Qing, it seemed the Great Mulberry Tree instinctively cultivated itself by absorbing the essence of the sun and moon and the seasonal energies. In a way, it had attained a deeper understanding of the Dao than his senior brothers or Zhang Jingxiu.  

However, had Zhou Qing not periodically absorbed the tree's yin energy and replenished it with his own yang qi, the Great Mulberry Tree might have descended into the "path of demons." If Zhou Qing hadn't appeared in this world, the creatures of Jiangzhou might have been physically devoured by the tree.  

Then again, perhaps not.  

Zhou Qing's gaze shifted from the Great Mulberry Tree to the ripe vermilion fruits nearby. His efforts in nourishing them with the essence of the Demon Tree's blood core had borne fruit—three vermilion fruit trees, each bearing ten fruits, totaling thirty.  

A bountiful harvest indeed.  

With so many vermilion fruits and the eight-leaf ginseng, he wondered how many complete Qi Condensation Pills he could refine.  

Additionally, the main ingredient for the Marrow-Cleansing Pill was thousand-year jade marrow. Now that the mortal factions were unified, numerous jade mines could be excavated, ensuring a steady supply.  

With the Marrow-Cleansing and Qi Condensation Pills, even an ordinary practitioner could be forcefully elevated to a level akin to Qing Lingzi's. However, in terms of cultivation potential, such individuals would pale in comparison to martial artists who tempered themselves with heavenly thunder, let alone the legendary immortal physiques.

### Heading North  

To refine the Qi Condensation Pills, Zhou Qing needed to travel north to the capital and utilize the Earth's Lung Fire. Once the pills were complete, the four of them had another major task ahead.  

According to intelligence from the Martial Virtue Division in the grasslands, a "Ghost Vine Demon" had emerged. The spies, unaware of the upheaval in the Central Plains, had risked their lives to relay this news.  

The demon was suspected to be the Grassland Martial Sage, though it was no longer the original sage. His body had been overtaken by a demonic "ghost vine," and he now roamed the endless grasslands, hunting warriors and slaughtering herdsmen and livestock.  

"Ghost Vine?" Zhou Qing recognized this as another demonic incident. What made it more troublesome was that the vine had parasitized a powerful innate martial artist.  

"What a waste."  

Zhou Qing felt a headache coming on. He couldn't help but feel anger toward the Grassland Martial Sage. As an innate expert, if the ghost vine hadn't fully developed, even a martial artist at the Gang Qi stage could have dealt with it. Even if it had grown significantly, escaping should have been effortless for an innate expert.  

Now, it seemed the Grassland Martial Sage had been completely overtaken.  

In a way, Zhou Qing and the Great Mulberry Tree shared a symbiotic relationship, supporting each other. The Grassland Martial Sage's situation was entirely different—a puppet of the ghost vine, relentlessly hunting warriors to fuel its growth.  

Fortunately, the grasslands were sparsely populated, especially in winter. The ghost vine's host would struggle to find ample prey.  

But once spring arrived, the situation would change. Based on recent years, the ice rivers would thaw around late March or early April.  

Zhou Qing still had plenty of time to prepare.  

Traveling alone to the capital, ignoring trivial matters, he could reach it in three days.  

After the vermilion fruits ripened, Zhou Qing briefed Lin Wan'er on necessary arrangements and set off for the capital with Mao Ri and the little snake. The medicinal garden was strictly off-limits—no living creatures were to approach the Great Mulberry Tree. This task fell to Yuan Mingyue, whose keen perception allowed her to sense the tree's emotions and aura.  

If the Great Mulberry Tree showed any abnormalities, she would sound the alarm.  

So far, neither the Great Mulberry Tree nor the Great Pine Tree of the Taihe Sect had shown signs of demonic transformation. The latter had exhibited tendencies, but the Taihe Sect maintained strict vigilance.  

According to their estimates, the Great Pine Tree's pinecones would mature in about a year. Zhou Qing was curious about their effects.

### The Hunt Begins  

The northern grasslands stretched endlessly for thousands of miles.  

Entering the grasslands felt entirely different from venturing into the mountains. While mountains teemed with diverse flora and fauna, the grasslands were a vast, unbroken expanse.  

In the freezing wilderness, life lay dormant. The group occasionally passed glaciers, but locating a single tribe—let alone the Grassland Martial Sage—was a daunting task.  

Zhou Qing's spiritual sense had reached the seventh layer of Qi Refinement, covering a radius of fifty zhang (about 150 feet). Yet, compared to the boundless grasslands, this was insignificant.  

Focusing on his Health Preservation Interface:  

**Qi: Fifth Layer of Qi Refinement.**  

With a thought, Zhou Qing flicked his finger, releasing a qi arrow that pierced through a glacier ahead.  

"Qi Manifested as Arrows," Zhang Jingxiu praised.  

This was Zhou Qing's "Qi Flick," mastered effortlessly. Within ten zhang (about 30 feet), it could threaten innate experts.  

Even Fu Song couldn't help but envy it, though his poor qi refinement talent meant he could never master such a technique.  

Zhou Qing smiled. "I heard the Grassland Martial Sage has a unique innate Gang Qi technique. I hope to witness it when we find him."  

Though Zhou Qing could condense Gang Qi, his method was rudimentary. The Grassland Martial Sage, having reached the innate realm, was undoubtedly a genius. His Gang Qi technique must have its merits.  

Zhang Jingxiu said, "He's been parasitized by the ghost vine. He may no longer have his original consciousness—or the ability to use innate Gang Qi."  

"Even better," Fu Shan remarked.  

He preferred weaker opponents to avoid complications.  

The Grassland Martial Sage, now a puppet of the ghost vine, was an unprecedented foe—more terrifying than the old eunuch, who had at least remained human.  

Their current enemy was an unknown monstrosity.  

Zhou Qing remained calm. According to reports, the ghost vine could release eerie mists, suggesting it was a wood-attributed demon with yin-ghost characteristics.  

With several ghost-subduing methods at his disposal, Zhou Qing was confident.  

Still, Mao Ri accompanied him. The rooster had grown increasingly mystical, capable of flying higher and even breathing fire—a sign of its awakening bloodline abilities.  

As for the little snake, Zhou Qing could now wield it like a flying dagger, effective even against innate experts.  

Their search continued until, at last, the sound of galloping horses reached them.  

In the frozen wilderness, they encountered their first group of grassland inhabitants—a dozen warriors chasing a lone herdsman.  

"Junior Brother, I don't understand their language. Do you?" Fu Song asked.  

Zhou Qing replied, "They're shouting to capture that 'southern barbarian.'"  

"How dare they? Calling our people barbarians?" Fu Song charged forward.  

The warriors shouted as the old Taoist blocked their path.  

Fu Song unleashed his Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm.  

One by one, the warriors fell from their horses as if cursed.  

The hot-tempered old Taoist left none alive—each corpse resembled a pile of mud.  

The fleeing herdsman turned back, stunned.  

"Are you from the Central Plains?"  

"Yes, I'm Qin De of the Martial Virtue Division."  

"Meeting us is your good fortune," Zhang Jingxiu said, though he held little fondness for the division's former loyalty to the Zhou royalty.  

"May I ask who you gentlemen are?" Qin De asked cautiously.  

Fu Shan smiled. "This is the Zhang Zhenren of Taihe Mountain. The elder who slew those grassland men is my junior brother, Fu Song of Qingfu Palace. As for the one beside me—"  

Before he could finish, Qin De dismounted and knelt. "Greetings, Master."  

The Martial Virtue Division had been absorbed into the Dao Court, and its former royalist members now acknowledged Zhou Qing as their leader—though some remained loyal to the Zhou, either in hiding or resistance.  

"Rise. Why were they chasing you?"  

Qin De replied, "I stole a map marking the Grassland Martial Sage's hidden treasure. His disciples discovered it and pursued me."  

"Let me see."  

"At once."  

Zhou Qing examined the map and immediately noticed something amiss.  

"You've been deceived. This map was recently made, though artificially aged. Someone is luring people to this location."  

"Then let's go straight there," Fu Song said.  

"Agreed."  

This was indeed a trap, but the schemer would never expect their "bait" to attract not fish—but sharks.  

Zhou Qing guessed multiple copies of the map had been circulated. If the enemy wanted to play games, they'd give him a surprise he wouldn't forget.  

Fu Shan nodded. "It seems 'he' retains some human consciousness—or has an advisor."  

Zhang Jingxiu scoffed, "Whatever tricks he has, the four of us will crush them."  

Zhou Qing added, "Elder Brother is right, but we should still be cautious."  

Confidence in strategy, caution in execution.  

Zhou Qing instructed Qin De to select a horse and join them.  

With their target set, they set off.  

Fu Song nodded. "After much deliberation, we've concluded you're a once-in-a-generation genius. You should follow Jingyang Zhenren's path—but we mustn't overreach."  

Zhang Jingxiu agreed. "We broke through to the innate realm as martial artists. Our paths are set. Among three thousand Daos, one must choose the most suitable."  

Zhou Qing understood. While essence, qi, and spirit complemented each other, ordinary practitioners had to prioritize.  

Even Zhou Qing, with his extraordinary soul talent, unconsciously drew from his qi and blood. His soul's out-of-body experience after the imperial exams had nearly cost him his life.  

For most cultivators, early specialization was crucial.  

Zhou Qing nodded. "I'll have the outer sect collect martial arts manuals for discussion. Physical refinement remains a priority for me."  

For Zhou Qing, spirit came first, then body, then qi. Yet his dual innate transformations and continuous organ refinement through Five Organs Thunder made his qi talent surpass the three elders.  

Thus, he could quickly digest elixirs. However, repeated use diminished their effects—a limitation akin to an unspoken law.  

His understanding of cultivation was still limited.  

Patience was key. With the Dao Court's growing influence and resources like demonic creatures, his foundation would only strengthen.  

Next, Zhou Qing refined Qi Condensation Pills and upgraded the Lost Path Array's flags into basic magical artifacts controllable via his qi.  

He also used scraps of the eight-leaf ginseng to craft Blood Qi Pills for the elders.  

By late February, the four set out for the grasslands in peak condition.  

---

The vast northern grasslands spanned thousands of miles.  

Their journey felt entirely different from mountain expeditions. While mountains brimmed with life, the grasslands were an endless, frozen plain.  

Amid the icy desolation, they occasionally passed glaciers. Finding a single tribe—let alone the Grassland Martial Sage—was a monumental task.  

Zhou Qing's spiritual sense, now at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement, covered fifty zhang (150 feet). Yet against the grasslands' immensity, it was negligible.  

His Health Preservation Interface showed:  

**Qi: Fifth Layer of Qi Refinement.**  

With a flick of his finger, a qi arrow shattered a glacier ahead.  

"Qi Manifested as Arrows," Zhang Jingxiu praised.  

Zhou Qing's "Qi Flick" had reached proficiency—deadly within ten zhang (30 feet) against innate experts.  

Fu Song watched enviously, though his poor qi talent barred him from such techniques.  

Zhou Qing smiled. "The Grassland Martial Sage's innate Gang Qi technique must be impressive. I hope to see it."  

Though Zhou Qing could condense Gang Qi, his method was crude. The sage's technique, honed through innate mastery, likely held secrets.  

Zhang Jingxiu said, "Parasitized by the ghost vine, he may have lost his skills."  

"Good," Fu Shan said.  

A weaker enemy meant fewer risks.  

This foe—a fusion of man and demon—was more terrifying than the human eunuch.  

Zhou Qing remained calm. Reports indicated the ghost vine emitted eerie mists, suggesting wood and yin-ghost attributes.  

With ghost-subduing methods and Mao Ri—now capable of flight and fire-breathing—he was prepared.  

The little snake served as a lethal projectile.  

Their search continued until hoofbeats echoed in the distance.  

In the frozen expanse, they encountered their first grassland group—warriors chasing a herdsman.  

"Junior Brother, what are they saying?" Fu Song asked.  

Zhou Qing translated: "They're after that 'southern barbarian.'"  

"How dare they?" Fu Song intercepted the warriors.  

His Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm felled them like puppets with cut strings.  

The hot-tempered elder left no survivors.  

The herdsman, Qin De, identified himself as a Martial Virtue Division agent.  

After verifying the map was a trap, the group decided to spring it—on their terms.  

With their target set, they rode forth, ready to confront the ghost vine's horror.
