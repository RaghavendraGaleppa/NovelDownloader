# Chapter 152: Advancement of the Truth-Discerning Eye

Zhou Qing currently assumed the identity of a spirit cultivator through the Thousand Illusions transformation, using the Tiger Demon Bright King as his foundation to bypass the rules of the Yellow Spring Path.

The surrounding Yellow Spring aura surged toward him as the Tiger Demon Bright King transformed into a dharma robe, manifesting externally and absorbing the Yellow Spring energy like a whale inhaling water. The tiger-patterned dharma robe formed by the Tiger Demon Bright King grew increasingly distinct in its fur patterns.

Zhou Qing pressed forward, advancing another dozen miles deeper. He could clearly sense that he had reached the depths of this extreme yin earth vein born from the Yellow Spring Path.

Although the Tiger Demon Bright King was also a product of spirit cultivation techniques and unafraid of the Yellow Spring aura, it had absorbed so much Yellow Spring energy along the way that it was nearing saturation. It needed further evolution.

Zhou Qing also felt the mad influx of baleful energy into the Tiger Demon Bright King. The negative emotions carried by this energy began affecting him, with scenes of mountains of corpses and seas of blood flashing through his mind. While Zhou Qing wasn't afraid of this baleful energy, prolonged exposure would undoubtedly harm him.

With a thought, a large mulberry tree emerged from within him. Nowadays, he might leave the Rooster Spirit behind when traveling, but he always carried the great mulberry tree. This way, no matter what unexpected situations arose, he could handle them calmly with the combined power of himself and the tree. Moreover, his enemies were unaware of the mulberry tree's existence, giving him the element of surprise.

As the great mulberry tree emerged into the world, this heaven-and-earth spiritual root currently stood only five zhang tall. The deeper into the cavern they went, the more astonishingly vast it became, as if existing in an overlapping interdimensional space.

Before becoming a heaven-and-earth spiritual root, the great mulberry tree already possessed soul-refining abilities. Now, accompanying Zhou Qing, it absorbed Yellow Spring energy ten times faster than the Tiger Demon Bright King. Its leaves grew increasingly verdant, almost ink-black in hue.

"Indeed, the great mulberry tree is most effective against such yin-tainted energies. Unfortunately, this Yellow Spring energy is essentially resentment rather than ghosts, so it can't be converted into soul-powered mulberries," Zhou Qing noted inwardly.

With the great mulberry tree handling the absorption, the Tiger Demon Bright King could focus on transforming the Yellow Spring energy it had already absorbed. In a sense, the Tiger Demon Bright King could be considered a top-tier spirit cultivation artifact, currently in the process of transitioning from the virtual to the substantial.

Observing the Tiger Demon Bright King's growth, Zhou Qing understood why spirit cultivators could emerge from the Yellow Spring Path—it was indeed a blessed land for them. However, ordinary spirit cultivators would find the mental fortitude required for cultivation here too demanding; the slightest lapse could allow the baleful energy to invade their minds, no different from demonic cultivators succumbing to demonic influence. This explained the cruel methods employed by spirit cultivators.

Cultivating with Yellow Spring energy made it difficult to resist the erosion of baleful energy on one's mind. Zhou Qing suspected that beasts transforming into demonic creatures might also be related to this Yellow Spring energy.

The deeper into this extreme yin earth vein they went, the more concentrated the Yellow Spring energy became. Even if Zhou Qing used his Divine Sword Thunder Control True Art, it would be impossible to cleanse the area—the sheer volume of Yellow Spring energy here was overwhelming, making his technique seem like trying to extinguish a fire with a cup of water.

Fortunately, with the Tiger Demon Bright King and the great mulberry tree, Zhou Qing not only remained unaffected by the Yellow Spring energy but also gained an opportunity to temper the Tiger Demon Bright King. The great mulberry tree also grew somewhat through this process.

However, through his connection with the tree, Zhou Qing could sense that the extreme yin baleful energy within the Yellow Spring aura was affecting it. The tree's temperament was becoming irritable, like entering menopause, losing its previous stability.

Zhou Qing temporarily stored the great mulberry tree in his inner world, relying solely on the Tiger Demon Bright King to simulate a spirit cultivator's aura as he ventured deeper.

A chilling wind blew past, and even with Zhou Qing's constitution, he felt bone-piercing cold. "This level of yin cold is almost comparable to Mingyue's Profound Darkness energy, though much more impure," he mused. Activating his newly refined Ice Soul Divine Light to cover his body, much of the chilling energy dissipated. As for the remaining yin baleful energy, his physical body could withstand it, though prolonged exposure would hinder his cultivation.

The path ahead grew increasingly dark, but Zhou Qing could emit his own light and had his Truth-Discerning Eye. While his spiritual sense was severely suppressed in this extreme yin earth vein, it wasn't completely blinded.

Black profound ice gradually covered the path ahead—extremely hard. When encountering obstructing ice, Zhou Qing used his Green Bamboo Sword to clear the way. Even with the sword's sharpness, carving through the profound ice wasn't easy. Zhou Qing collected the chipped black ice fragments; from the appraisal manuals he'd obtained from the Tianxuan City treasure appraiser, he recognized this as extreme yin earth baleful energy that had condensed over thousands or even tens of thousands of years into profound ice. When forged into artifacts, its effectiveness wouldn't be much inferior to Geng Metal.

For ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators, being struck by this extreme yin profound ice could temporarily freeze their true essence, immobilizing them.

"This extreme yin earth vein formed by the Yellow Spring Path is truly bizarre. I need to find the extreme yin earth flame quickly," Zhou Qing thought as he pressed onward.

Without his specialized tools—the Tiger Demon Bright King, great mulberry tree, and Ice Soul Divine Light—tailored for dealing with extreme yin earth baleful energy and Yellow Spring aura, even a normal mid-stage Golden Core cultivator would be exhausted by this point, possibly unable to return.

His Five Elements True Body, along with his Yin-Yang Divine Light and Divine Sword Thunder Control True Art, allowed him to resist the environment's effects.

Back in his water manor, Zhou Qing inventoried his gains from the extreme yin earth vein expedition. The journey had carried considerable risk, prompting him to consider acquiring or creating a technique for cultivating avatars or puppets to make future explorations safer.

After organizing his harvest and confirming the stability of the extreme yin earth flame in his inner world, Zhou Qing began practicing the fourth layer of the Truth-Discerning Eye technique. Having just advanced, he needed to consolidate his progress and nurture the derivative supernatural ability that emerged from the eye technique.

As Zhou Qing entered meditation, the great mulberry tree in the medicinal garden stood pitch-black, as if dipped in ink, exuding an aura that kept others at bay. Even Lin Wan'er and Yuan Mingyue dared not approach. However, under Zhou Qing's instruction, Lin Wan'er occasionally played the Heart-Cleansing Universal Kindness Chant. Influenced by the Lingfei Wonderful Sound Scripture within the music, the tree's yin ghostly energy gradually dissipated, becoming increasingly vibrant.

Months passed in the blink of an eye.

When Zhou Qing opened his Truth-Discerning Eye, a divine light shot forth. New content appeared in his Health Preservation Record:

**Truth-Discerning Eye (Fourth Layer: Scolding Eye Divine Light - 'Beginner')**

A pale blue flame ignited. "This is the extreme yin earth flame, and it's been refined by someone," Zhou Qing realized with a start. The terrifying cold energy instantly enveloped him like extreme yin profound ice, rapidly draining his vitality and magic power.

Reacting swiftly, Zhou Qing released his Green Sun Spirit Flame. With the supremely yang attributes of solar divine fire, the spirit flame reacted violently upon encountering the extreme yin earth flame—like a spark landing in oil, threatening a massive explosion.

At this critical moment, Zhou Qing unleashed his Yin-Yang Divine Light. While the light's consumption was manageable against ghost generals, it rapidly dissipated the extreme yin earth flame. Though the Green Sun Spirit Flame remained inferior, guided by Zhou Qing's Truth-Discerning Eye's analysis of the earth flame's weaknesses, it engaged in a prolonged skirmish.

Gradually, the Yin-Yang Divine Light was exhausted, but the extreme yin earth flame was significantly weakened. Sensing the diminishing cold, Zhou Qing wrapped the earth flame with his Green Sun Spirit Flame like a net, then encased both with his Primordial Chaos Divine Light before drawing them into his inner world.

With a long exhale, Zhou Qing celebrated his complete success—not only obtaining the flame but also advancing his Truth-Discerning Eye to the fourth layer, enabling him to see through all existences below the Nascent Soul level. Moreover, he faintly sensed an offensive supernatural ability brewing within the eye, a natural derivative of the fourth layer's power.

Attempts to take the lotus-shaped lampstand failed despite multiple tries. Content with his gains, Zhou Qing departed without pushing his luck.

Shortly after Zhou Qing left, an ethereal green stone gate materialized above the altar's lotus lampstand. A shadowy figure with an ox's head emerged from the gate amidst black mist, holding a dark banner.

"This aura doesn't belong to our Yellow Spring Ghost Sect's spirit cultivators," the figure muttered, shaking the banner to gather dispersing black energy. "The Nether General guarding this place was completely annihilated? Who could have done this?"

"Never mind, this place was nearly abandoned anyway," the figure decided, resolving to report that the Yellow Spring Path here had been contaminated by yang-world energy, necessitating channel closure to prevent further pollution—blaming natural causes to cover up the incident.

Three hundred years prior, a great cultivator from the yang world had forcibly entered the Yellow Spring Path and stolen the Netherworld Ferry Scripture, devastating the Yellow Spring Ghost Sect's influence. If superiors learned that a purified extreme yin earth flame had been stolen from his jurisdiction, the punishment would be severe.

The sect had been planning to use such flames from various secret realms to cultivate a new Asura Sacred Flame, hoping to restore its prestige. Losing one purified flame would cost this high-ranking Nether Emissary dearly in spiritual stipends despite his status.

As a pure ghost cultivator with partial mortal memories, the emissary knew historical precedents of human officials burning storehouses to hide losses. Committed to his natural disaster narrative, he destroyed the altar, triggering massive explosions that destabilized the entire extreme yin earth vein before hastily retreating through the stone gate.

After delaying his report, the emissary resumed his leisurely existence. As a ghost cultivator with a baleful core, he could enjoy centuries of existence—comparable to a yang-world Nascent Soul elder's lifespan—before complete dissipation. Why risk his comfortable afterlife in sect conflicts?

The Yellow Spring Ghost Sect, established three millennia ago, had grown corrupt, its decline accelerating after losing the Netherworld Ferry Scripture. Previously, idle ghost cultivators like the emissary faced purges, but now they blended into the background.

During a drinking session with Elder Ge, the emissary inquired about the upcoming campaign to expand the Blood Sea region—a costly endeavor to capture male Asuras as shock troops and rare female Asuras as luxury commodities for the elite, alongside harvesting blood crystals valuable as spiritual stones.

"Not yet decided," the drunken elder replied. Taking the hint, the emissary summoned a stunning ghost maiden to serve the elder, ensuring either exemption from the dangerous assignment or a safe posting if unavoidable.

Though prominent in the sect, the emissary prioritized survival, having outlasted most peers through caution. Back in his water manor, Zhou Qing reflected on his risky expedition, resolving to develop avatar or puppet techniques for safer future explorations. After stabilizing his fourth-layer Truth-Discerning Eye and its emerging Scolding Eye Divine Light ability, he prepared for new challenges ahead.
