# Chapter 67: Righteous Aura! Senior, Save Us!

When sinister energy invades the body, it poses a significant challenge even for those at the True Qi realm. Although painful, they can still expel it by sacrificing some of their True Qi through their acupoints. However, for those at the Internal Qi realm who haven't yet opened their acupoints, it becomes a deadly threat.

Yet, the man and the bird before them were exceptions. The former possessed a golden page capable of absorbing evil energy, while the latter had auspicious bloodline traits that could counteract it.

"Is this what they call 'evil energy invasion'?" Even the Five Elements Creation Tree couldn't hide its disdain.

The trio—man, bird, and tree—finally steadied themselves.

Li Zhengjing pondered, "Chen Xuan came from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect and traveled all the way here on the Sky Ship. Where did he get this sinister energy?"

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its roots and declared, "He must have had accomplices in Twin Nine City!"

The wall-clinging bird chimed in, "He probably planned to silence us by releasing the sinister energy to envelop our courtyard. By the time Twin Nine City cleared the energy, it would be like helping him dispose of our bodies to the north! He just didn’t expect to end up dead at our hands instead..."

After speaking, the bird flew high into the sky, surveyed the area, and moments later landed back on Li Zhengjing's shoulder.

"Master, that old ghost Chen Xuan lost his head to your blade. His corpse was shaken out by Twin Nine City and turned into mush."

"Did you see the direction of Twin Nine City?"

"To your left!" the bird said. "That's the south! This time, Twin Nine City gave a shake and tossed us over thirty miles away. But with our speed, we can return in no time."

"Before he died, Chen Xuan said he’d drag us down with him. Was this all he had?" Li Zhengjing stroked his chin. "Did he think we’d die from the fall after being thrown thirty miles in the midst of evil energy?"

"If not for my wings, we’d be dead or at least severely injured," the bird muttered.

"And if not for the Creation Five Elements Pill made from my materials, those injuries wouldn’t heal so fast!" the Five Elements Creation Tree added indignantly, waving its branches. "Internal injuries damage the foundation and can hinder future cultivation progress..."

"Enough. When we return to the sect, Master will reward you handsomely."

With that, Li Zhengjing packed up, slung the phoenix wood box onto his back, and motioned for the bird and the tree to return inside.

Gazing southward, he mused, "Thirty miles is nothing—we can run back in no time even without a Swiftness Talisman. Did that old man Chen Xuan really think he could make me his burial companion here? Or is there more to his plan?"

"Master is overthinking it. He was just delusional."

The bird poked its head out of the box and looked toward Twin Nine City. With its innate divine sight, it pierced through illusions to see the scene ahead—and froze.

Li Zhengjing halted mid-step.

The sky ahead was in turmoil—thunder roared, winds howled, and sunlight twisted under the pressure of residual magical power, as if torn apart. A storm of energy surged from the other side of Twin Nine City, rapidly approaching.

"They're fighting their way over here!" the bird shrieked. "Run!"

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page, where his fortune read: *Ahead lies Twin Nine City. On the way, you will encounter the Ancient Moon Peak Master battling the three helmsmen of the Golden Ship of Salvation. Caught in the aftermath, you will die without a whole corpse.*

Without hesitation, he slapped a Swiftness Talisman onto himself and bolted in the opposite direction.

He sprinted northward for two to three hours until the talisman's spiritual energy was exhausted. By then, the chaotic aftermath of the battle was no longer visible.

Panting heavily and having expended half his Internal Qi, he finally stopped.

"Master, maybe we should wait until the fighting’s over before heading back to Twin Nine City..." the bird said, fluttering out of the box, still shaken.

"Who knows how long a battle between Immortals will last?" Li Zhengjing cursed under his breath. He pulled out the token given to him by the Ancient Moon Peak Master but shook his head and put it away.

According to the Peak Master's speculation, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official would likely hide in Twin Nine City, awaiting the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's escort. The Golden Ship of Salvation would also have agents lying in wait there.

Originally, Li Zhengjing was supposed to deliver the token to the Spirit Official and escort him onto the Sky Ship for immediate return to the sect. But now, having been thrown out of the city, he couldn’t risk going back yet. The mission would have to wait.

"We're already far from Twin Nine City," the bird said, landing on Li Zhengjing's shoulder after a quick aerial survey. "Master, I’ve heard Twin Nine City is called the 'Land of Bitter Cold,' full of dangers. About 1,800 miles north lies the infamous Fengdu Mountain, still teeming with sinister anomalies. Only Immortals dare venture there. Thankfully, we're still some distance away."

Li Zhengjing frowned. "What kind of dangers, exactly?"

The bird scratched its head with a wing, struggling to recall, then dove back into the box and rummaged through some books.

"Found it! At night, sinister energy erupts like a tidal wave or a collapsing mountain! Even True Qi realm cultivators can’t expel it fast enough. They might hold out briefly, but they’ll be completely corrupted!"

"Oh, just sinister energy?" The bird chuckled. "That’s nothing to worry about!"

Before it could finish, its eyes widened in horror.

Li Zhengjing followed its gaze northward.

The sky there was pitch black, and the land was engulfed in a flood of sinister energy, like a dam bursting. Even more terrifying—shadowy figures flickered within the energy, countless in number.

"Wait a minute..." The bird hastily flipped the page. "Seventeen years ago, the sects suppressed a million demonic entities, but the source of Fengdu Mountain’s evil energy remained. It’s tied to some great secret, so they could only seal it, not eradicate it!"

"Because the source wasn’t destroyed, some of the million demons must have escaped, hidden within the energy. Over time, new ones would emerge!"

"Not to mention the countless soldiers of the Great Zhou Dynasty and disciples of various sects who died in battle. Though most were properly buried, many corpses were lost in the northern lands."

"If those who died held onto grudges, resentment, or were betrayed, their remains could transform into demons under the corrupting influence of the sinister energy!"

"Twin Nine City was built to block these demons from spreading southward into the Central Plains!"

The bird's voice trembled with panic. "Master, we might not fear the energy, but too much of it could drown us! And with all those demons lurking inside... we might be done for!"

Li Zhengjing looked back. "Has the fighting in Twin Nine City ended? If we return before nightfall, we might still make it."

The bird was about to fly up and check when the sky behind them darkened ominously.

"Damn it! They’re coming this way again?"

"Run!"

Li Zhengjing strapped on the box, activated another Swiftness Talisman, and dashed off, cursing inwardly. *I only had three of these talismans, earned through merit, and now I’ve used two! What kind of cursed place is this?*

He briefly considered hiding inside the phoenix wood box—since the Five Elements Creation Tree had been unaffected by the sinister energy inside—but the battle between the Ancient Moon Peak Master and the three helmsmen was shifting northward again. The box might shield him from the energy, but the residual force of an Immortal-level battle would shatter it to pieces.

"Master, where are we running to?" the bird wailed. "Ahead is a sea of sinister energy packed with demons! Behind us is an Immortal battle—one stray blast, and we’re dead meat! I’m only eight! I haven’t even married yet! Is this how I die?"

"Shut up!" Li Zhengjing snapped inwardly. *How should I know where to go?*

He pulled out a spirit stone, ready to consult the golden page for guidance. But just then, a brilliant white light flashed in the northwest—pure, righteous, and unmistakably from a high-ranking orthodox cultivator.

*Why isn’t this expert helping the Ancient Moon Peak Master?*

He checked the golden page again. His fate remained unchanged—he would still die from the backlash of the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi. Relieved, he changed course toward the white light.

The bird spotted it too and cried out joyfully, "Senior, save us!"

The moment the words left its beak, the white light flickered—and vanished.

Li Zhengjing stopped in his tracks.

Silence fell.

"...Is this senior perhaps a bit... cowardly?"
