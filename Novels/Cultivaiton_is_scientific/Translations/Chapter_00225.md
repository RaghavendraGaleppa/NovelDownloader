# Chapter 225: Pursuit

Jue Tu Buddha's heart was filled with murderous intent, yet he retained a sliver of clarity. He had received orders from Zhi Kong Arhat to retrieve the Jade Foot Relic containing the Divine Foot Technique inheritance. 

He could sense the relic's location, so after charging into the battlefield, he followed its aura. Every demonic cultivator he encountered along the way was effortlessly slain. His killing speed was astonishingly fast, yet it didn't hinder his movement in the slightest.

However, Li Yuanba kept moving, forcing Jue Tu Buddha to constantly adjust his direction, effectively tracing an arc across the battlefield.

Li Yuanba sensed the danger—that terrifying murderous intent was palpable even from a great distance. 

Elder Lü also detected Jue Tu Buddha's presence, his expression shifting slightly. He wasn't worried about his own safety, but if he were forced to unleash his suppressed golden core-level strength, it would invite serious trouble. 

In this foundation-establishment battlefield, both sides had golden core cultivators watching closely—perhaps even nascent soul elders and venerables. If Elder Lü were to reveal his true strength, he couldn't guarantee whether he'd face围攻 from righteous path golden core cultivators. Worse still, if nascent soul experts or venerables intervened, it would mean certain death.

Thus, he accelerated, hoping to catch up with Li Yuanba quickly and resolve the matter.

As he sped up, he could no longer conceal his presence. Li Yuanba sensed both the foundation-establishment late-stage aura behind him and Jue Tu Buddha's murderous intent—both seemingly targeting him.

Li Yuanba's heart sank. The foundation-establishment late-stage aura was clearly tracking him, and few in the foundation-establishment realm could follow him undetected. He suspected it was a true disciple sent by Elder Lü, never imagining the elder himself would come.

Even if it were just Elder Lü's disciple, it wouldn't be easy to handle. Combined with the murderous pursuer, being caught would likely force him to use his final trump card—the Sword Intent Prayer Beads. He preferred not to use them unless absolutely necessary, as they weren't just a one-time lifesaving tool. By keeping them close, he could continuously study Sword Elder's sword intent, greatly aiding his own progress.

Li Yuanba had no choice but to speed up and reunite with his true self, Li Shiming. With Li Shiming's help, they might stand a chance against the two pursuers.

With this thought, he stopped holding back. White lotuses bloomed beneath his feet, the next appearing nearly a hundred meters away. His figure flickered as he stepped onto it.

---

White lotuses appeared alternately as his figure vanished and reappeared in the void.

"Lotus Steps—the Divine Foot Technique!" Elder Lü, following closely, witnessed Li Yuanba's sudden acceleration and clearly saw the white lotuses beneath his feet. 

How could he not recognize this most profound movement technique of the Thousand Leaves Temple? "Lotus Steps" was the most basic form of the Divine Foot Technique, barely scratching the surface of its power.

He was shocked. If Li Yuanba had mastered the Divine Foot Technique, did that mean the inheritance he obtained could be freely learned? Perhaps Jue Yuan Buddha had left his own insights behind, allowing Li Yuanba to grasp it so easily.

Elder Lü believed his own talent far surpassed Li Yuanba's—a natural assumption for a golden core cultivator. Geniuses were common—every Ascension Assembly uncovered several—but few truly grew to their potential. 

While geniuses almost always reached foundation-establishment, advancing to golden core was far harder. It required not just talent but also resources—scarce even in the relatively prosperous North Shu Continent. 

Each major sect's golden core resources were fiercely contested among geniuses, selecting only the strongest and luckiest. Elder Lü had risen through such competition, so he was confident in his superiority.

Now, he considered capturing Li Yuanba alive to extract the secrets of mastering "Lotus Steps."

Li Yuanba's speed was staggering. His first practical use of "Lotus Steps" demonstrated overwhelming velocity, quickly leaving the foundation-establishment late-stage pursuer behind—his speed more than double theirs. 

Even the distant murderous intent failed to close the gap, fading as the distance grew. 

Changing direction, Li Yuanba signaled his true self, Li Shiming, to prepare. 

Yet despite leaving the pursuer's detection range, he still sensed their aura—now fully exposed as they gave chase at full speed.

---

"Lotus Steps" allowed Li Yuanba to move swiftly without expending much spiritual energy, enabling him to conceal his aura. In theory, with enough speed, he could shake off pursuers.

But he was wrong. No matter how he changed direction, both the foundation-establishment late-stage cultivator and the murderous intent adjusted accordingly, maintaining their lock on him.

"Elder Lü's pat must have left something on me," he realized. 

After being ambushed by Wang Chengjun and his demonic cultivators, Li Yuanba had been extremely cautious, avoiding any chance for others to mark him. The only opportunity had been Elder Lü's earlier contact.

As for the other pursuer, he suspected it was tied to the Jade Foot Relic. 

This wasn't baseless speculation. Upon discovering the incredible speed of "Lotus Steps"—the most basic technique in the relic—he understood its immense value. If the Thousand Leaves Temple couldn't track such a treasure, he'd be shocked.

The murderous pursuer was likely a temple Buddha sent to reclaim it.

He wasn't worried about the relic's mark. Once he reached Li Shiming, he'd hand it over. Inside the machine room space, no method could detect it—a fact he trusted completely, having hidden numerous precious items there before.

Elder Lü and Jue Tu Buddha became aware of each other. Elder Lü wanted to avoid conflict, but Jue Tu Buddha had dual objectives: retrieve the relic and slaughter Sen Luo Sect cultivators.

To Jue Tu Buddha, Elder Lü's powerful aura marked him as a top-tier Sen Luo Sect true disciple—a high-value target not to be missed. 

As for Li Yuanba, the relic's mark ensured he couldn't escape. Retrieving it was only a matter of time.

---

Jue Tu Buddha lunged at Elder Lü, his murderous intent surging like a tidal wave. 

Elder Lü's hair stood on end. Though the killing intent unsettled him, his golden core-level spirit remained unaffected. 

"Damn it! The Thousand Leaves Temple's 'Killing to Achieve Buddhahood' technique! How did our sect's intelligence miss this monster?" he cursed inwardly. 

Increasing his speed with a secret technique, he tried to widen the gap. 

He believed Li Yuanba's use of "Lotus Steps" would drain him quickly. Once caught, he'd extract the secrets and leave the battlefield before trouble arose.

But Jue Tu Buddha was relentless. His murderous intent solidified into a spectral boat beneath his feet, propelling him forward with terrifying speed.

---

Meanwhile, Li Yuanba neared Li Shiming's location, slowing as he entered a prearranged formation—a 128-flag array. 

Though not yet a formation master, Li Shiming's skills were top-tier among advanced formation experts, combining knowledge from Tian Hai Sect, Zong Shan Sect, and others. Given more time, his AI, IBMz15, would fully analyze these, potentially elevating him to mastery.

Li Yuanba stood within the formation, summoning the Giant Mountain Talisman Treasure but still withholding the Sword Intent Prayer Beads.

Elder Lü, sensing the mark had stopped moving, rejoiced—he was close. Glancing back at Jue Tu Buddha's hellish visage, he shuddered. 

This was the Thousand Leaves Temple's most fearsome cultivation method: achieving Buddhahood through slaughter, justifying it as purging demons. Few dared practice it, even among demonic cultivators. Those who succeeded became terrors haunting the cultivation world for centuries.

Pushing his speed to the limit without breaking his suppression seal, Elder Lü was confident he'd reach Li Yuanba first. 

A mere foundation-establishment early-stage cultivator couldn't resist him—even suppressed, his golden core combat experience ensured instant victory.

Finally, he spotted Li Yuanba, standing calmly atop a white lotus, appearing more Buddha-like than his pursuer. 

Li Yuanba was inwardly stunned—Elder Lü himself had entered the battlefield, risking exposure to golden core adversaries for the relic.

As Elder Lü lunged with a masterful grab, honed over five centuries of battle, Li Yuanba remained still—protected by the formation.

Elder Lü twisted mid-air, avoiding collision, and stared in shock. 

He knew Li Yuanba had studied formations but never imagined such rapid progress. Constructing this array in such a short time defied all conventional wisdom.
