# Chapter 329: The Strange Sect, Crushing the Third Realm, Like an Immortal, Gazed Upon by Beauties

Zheng Dechun relied on his exquisite light footwork to deftly dodge the arrows several times. The Red Silk Bride-Step was a peculiar technique, originally a "dual cultivation" skill requiring a man and a woman to practice together, becoming one within the other. Feinting attacks, flanking disturbances, and body-to-body collisions... the footwork was agile and divine, making it difficult for opponents to defend against. Zheng Dechun was neither fully male nor female, having "married" himself... managing to cultivate it alone, adding a unique twist to it!

As he moved several steps, his figure was graceful and enchanting. One step forward was like a maiden waiting to be married, filled with anticipation and longing; another step was like a groom welcoming his bride. The footwork was eerie, yet incredibly fast.

He was neither clearly male nor female; his waist was slender but his shoulders broad, his hair long but his feet large, his voice sharp but his face square. He was gloomy and terrifying, strange and chilling. Such a appearance made one tremble with fear upon seeing him, how could anyone dare to fight him to the death?

Zheng Dechun covered his face and wept, appearing mournful and sorrowful, as if thinking of something deeply. It was like a woman on the eve of a grand wedding, marrying far away, bidding farewell to her parents. With every step he took, the "Ethereal Chimes" and "Chest Drum Thunder" within his body simultaneously transformed into "wailing sounds" that rippled out. It made listeners shed tears, obstructing their footwork, and making them reluctant to flee.

This martial art was strange and unpredictable. Before the fight even truly began, it produced all sorts of bizarre phenomena, leaving people confused and unable to comprehend it.

Li Xian silently played the "Body Guarding Sound" and "Yang Playing Immortal Sound" to resist the influence of the wailing. Seeing Zheng Dechun instantly climb the chain and ascend, his speed was incredibly fast. Li Xian pondered: "This person's strength is formidable, his footwork bizarre and诡谲. Fortunately, I have fought against Third Realm martial artists before, so his capabilities are within my expectations."

He immediately flew his body to escape. The Prison Girl Gorge had hundreds of iron chains hanging between the two cliff faces. In the past, young servants climbed these chains to deliver food and water to the women living in the chambers. Today, Li Xian utilized everything to its fullest, swinging on the iron chains to dodge and flash. If speaking of speed, he was far inferior to Zheng Dechun, but his archery was superb. Every time he flew to escape, he would inevitably shoot several arrows to support himself.

Zheng Dechun's morale had already been dampened, fearing arrows like a tiger fears fire. Even though his footwork was ghostly and peculiar, dodging the arrows was not easy. His speed was always hindered. This tiny difference in speed meant he could never catch up to Li Xian.

After circling for a while, Li Xian swung left and right, leaping and dodging between the chains, yet he remained unharmed by Zheng Dechun. Zhao Chunxia watched him swing to the right and then to the front, sometimes disappearing, sometimes swinging to the opposite wall. She praised him highly: "Li Xian's archery is superb. He dares to tangle with Zheng Dechun, truly possessing his own unique skills. Zheng Dechun is furious now, but he is entangled and has no way to deal with it!"

Tang Mengluo, Bao Hanhan, He Lijun, Peng Sanluo, and other female elders from various sects all nodded in unison,不住 praising: "Good! Just use archery to tangle him, there might be a chance to win!" "As long as he fully utilizes his advantages, he might be able to defeat him." "This child is very smart, not a reckless fool. Facing a Third Realm expert, he remains calm and composed!"

Lin Aoshan, Luo Feiyan, and Mu Hongchou had broad visions, but they secretly worried and broke into a cold sweat. Although they were trading blows back and forth, if Li Xian made the slightest mistake, it would be hard to end well. The Prison Girl Gorge was bustling with excitement just a moment ago, but now it is silent, with only the two of them fighting visible.

The wind howled, arrows whistled, roars echoed, iron chains clanged, sparks flew, and shadows darted...

This entanglement lasted for half an incense stick's time. Several dangerous situations occurred but were resolved. Li Xian was elegant and unrestrained, while Zheng Dechun had already sustained arrow wounds and felt mentally exhausted.

Zheng Dechun thought angrily: "You little monkey! Do you really think I can't do anything to you? Although your archery is strong, making me helpless, if you didn't have the iron chains to swing away, what would you do?" He had calmed down now, realizing that Li Xian was agile, aided by archery, and planned carefully. Even though his cultivation was high and his martial arts strong... he was always restrained, and most of his martial arts could not be displayed. If this continued, he would surely lose heart and fail.

He stopped rushing to kill. Every time he saw Li Xian swing to another place, he顺势 grabbed the iron chain and threw it into the air. He threw several iron chains consecutively, and they actually tangled and knotted in the air. This was the "Mandarin Duck Red Rope Palm." A palm strike on a person would cause the "meridians," "blood vessels," and "bones" inside the body to tangle and knot, forming a "Mandarin Duck Red Knot." It was slightly similar to the Blue Silk Palm.

His martial arts realm was very high. His martial art evolved strangely like a god. Just by throwing the iron chain up, he wove an iron chain Mandarin Duck Knot. The hundreds of chains were now useless. Once they were all tangled, Li Xian's strategy of swinging would be useless.

The women with smaller胆子惊呼 out loud, stomping their feet anxiously, panicking for no reason. It was as if they were personally in danger. They were all thinking of countermeasures to remind the young hero. But thinking left and right, it was always useless.

Zhao Chunxia cursed: "What a wicked thief, truly difficult to deal with!" She remained deeply worried, staring intently at the battle situation.

Many iron chains were tangled. Li Xian was left with only one chain to stand on, with nowhere else to swing. Zheng Dechun climbed along the chain, and in an instant, he was several zhang closer. Li Xian remained calm and stopped fleeing. Seeing the opportunity, he shot an arrow down.

Zheng Dechun swayed his body, trying to dodge completely, but this arrow incorporated the "Raging Waves" move of the Blue Silk Palm, like a great wave surging forward. At such a distance, with such archery, how could he miss? Zheng Dechun suppressed his palpitations, using the "Flying Dragon Searching Cloud Hand" to forcefully catch it. His martial art evolved, dragon chants rang out, and his palm seemed to be covered in golden scales.

Only the sound of "Clang, Clang, Clang" was heard. Zheng Dechun's waist was forced backward by the force of the arrow. He gritted his teeth and growled silently: "This child's realm is very shallow, his age very young, how can his internal Qi be so雄浑 and his strength so fierce? Although his archery is strong, it shouldn't have made me this troubled. But with all his abilities combined, it really makes me helpless." His feet tightly hooked the iron chain. Forced down several zhang by this arrow, his toes rubbed against the chain, creating sparks, and the chain turned red and hot.

Snowflakes landed on the iron chain and instantly turned into steam. Before Zheng Dechun could catch his breath, the second arrow followed closely. He had to harden himself to take it, his figure被打 down several zhang again. The third arrow, the fourth arrow... sparks flew, the iron chain burned hot, Zheng Dechun's face was unsightly. He had already climbed halfway up, but was beaten back arrow by arrow, falling back to the ground helplessly. His hands were burned, skin broken and blood flowing. He couldn't block all the arrows; his shoulders and back had arrow wound scratches, looking extremely狼狈 for the moment.

Zheng Dechun suddenly flew into a rage. One hand blocked arrows, the other hand grabbed the chain and spun it. The chain made a "Clang, Clang" sound, spinning and shaking, transmitting palm force through the chain. Although this plan was clever, Li Xian's archery was superb. Zheng Dechun holding the chain with one hand made it hard to dodge the flying arrows. Li Xian shot the arrows, always making Zheng Dechun feel restricted.

Retreating was not good, advancing was not good. His intentions were always detected early. He never thought that relying solely on the power of archery could force him into such狼狈. The elders felt relieved seeing Zheng Dechun in such a miserable state. Bao Hanhan suddenly "Ah"一声, her joyful expression vanishing, turning to worry.

It turned out Li Xian's arrow bag was gradually empty. Li Xian used the high terrain to fully utilize his advantage. If he had no arrows to use, his weakness would be immediately apparent. Then he would surely be in great danger. She wanted to remind him, but was more afraid the enemy would hear it first.

Gradually, all the elders noticed, their hearts hanging in the air. When Li Xian shot the last arrow, the disciples also noticed. Several women惊呼 out loud, their joy instantly replaced by fear.

Zheng Dechun finally found the opportunity. He quickly rushed up the chain, his two palms fiercely imprinting towards Li Xian's chest. Li Xian remained calm and thought: "This person's fist and foot skills are weaker. He has already消耗了气力 and worn down his mind by my flying arrows. Now is the best time to lure the enemy deep." He hooked the iron ring with his toes and shot straight up.

The elders sighed: "Dangerous, dangerous!" They all felt Li Xian had exhausted his skills. In this situation, his life was hard to保. They couldn't help but feel more regretful: "Such a young man, dying here. Heaven pities him, how can villains rule and harm for a thousand years. This fine young man is in a tragic situation."

Suddenly, a woman惊叫, her voice filled with joy. It was seen that Zheng Dechun had finally approached Li Xian's side. By right, the victor was decided. Li Xian no longer retreated, suddenly reaching into his sleeve and pulling out a spear. The Ghost Python poked its head out, catching Zheng Dechun off guard.

The elders were immediately surprised. Could it be that this child, besides being good at archery, also had achievements in spear arts? Zhao Chunxia's mood fluctuated slightly, knowing Li Xian was skilled in using the spear. This hint had just been revealed, but his attainments already shocked the旁观者.

Li Xian's aura changed instantly: "Even if it's the Third Realm, do I fear you!" When martial artists exchange moves, fight for life and death... it is most taboo to be hesitant. The heart can be cautious and guarded, but the spear must go straight for the dragon.

The spear thrust continuously, cold iron brushed past snowflakes. The spear technique stirred up a cold wind. "Crows Defeating the Moon," "Mischievous Ghosts Playing in Water"... many spear moves were fully displayed. The spear momentum was fierce and ruthless, the spear charm刁钻.

It flowed like clouds and water, like a painting, like a poem.

Although Zheng Dechun was in the Third Realm, his lifelong martial arts attainments were inferior to this set of spear techniques. It was almost at the peak, combined with a momentum like a river torrent, fierce and overwhelming, instantly打得 him措手不及.

Zheng Dechun broke out in a cold sweat, his heart growing more alarmed as he fought. He cursed silently: "Where did this小子 come from? His archery is厉害, fine. Who knew his spear arts are not weak either! If I had known this, I would not have rushed in close, losing the initiative." He felt even more that every spear move contained a fierce and蛮力, difficult to resolve.

In this situation, wanting to regain the initiative was extremely difficult.

He ducked low to avoid a spear, just about to counterattack. Suddenly he felt a pain on his face, his chest as if struck by a heavy palm. He was certain Li Xian hadn't touched him, but the heavy strike was real. Seeing the enemy spear thrusting again, he turned around to dodge.

He felt his waist was wrapped by something. As he turned, he was pulled back hard, while the Ghost Python spear stabbed straight at him. There was no way to dodge, he had to catch the spear barehanded. In his shock, he realized Li Xian's spear moves were endless. Whether he wanted to dodge, counterattack, retreat, or exhaust... he always felt an无形阻力. Or wrapping, or coiling, or slapping, or shaking... making him suffer unbearably.

He was completely confused. The onlookers were clear, while the player was confused. At this time, the female elders all had speculations, frowning, expressions of shock难以言表, muttering: "Pure Gang Qi Robe!?"

It turned out Li Xian was flexibly using the Pure Gang Qi Robe. The无形 Qi Robe could roll, spread, stretch, fan, cover, shroud, or shake... The two were fighting close together, always separated by a layer of Pure Gang Qi Robe. Li Xian used this robe flexibly, matching it with the spear technique, always having miraculous effects.

Sometimes he thrust the spear forward, the Pure Gang Qi Robe缠绕 the spear body. Zheng Dechun had no weapon in hand, and was fighting on the iron chains, how could he dodge completely? He had to catch it with his hands. The moment he grabbed the spear body, Li Xian pulled back the Qi Robe, while the spear thrust forward. In this way, one forward, one backward, Zheng Dechun didn't know the details, just felt his hand slip, his body move forward, and the long spear pierced him.

Zheng Dechun was covered in blood, having been pierced by several spears. Now he was extremely恼恨. He used several moves to press, trying to force Li Xian to fall to the ground, but all missed. Laughable that he underestimated the heroes of the world, showing his narrow vision and shallow temperament. He usually relied on strength to bully the weak, never having met a true hero.

Li Xian's spear technique was extremely refined, aided by the Pure Gang Qi Robe. On the iron chains, he had the upper hand. As the fight grew, his momentum rose. He thought: "Since I learned the Mischievous Ghost Spear, I have never met a true opponent. This Zheng Dechun is shallow-minded and narrow-tempered, just right to hone my spear path."

Just see on the iron chains, the silver spear danced急促ly, ghostly aura dense. It seemed as if a hundred ghosts appeared and danced wildly, two mischievous ghosts playfully frolicking, ghost hands covering eyes to tease. Three crying ghosts were凄苦哀怨, crying by the ears to disturb the spirit. Li Xian gathered his sharp intention, the spear shot out like a dragon, like a ghost, like a phantom. Zheng Dechun空有 cultivation,空有 martial arts evolution, but now he couldn't display it. After losing the initiative, he suffered a great loss. A dignified Third Realm martial artist,拨弄戏耍 by the spear technique, was actually dizzy and confused, not knowing how to defend!

The women's eyes revealed admiration. Mu Hongchou thought: "This is a true hero, not comparable to people like Zhou Shijie. Strategy and martial arts, spear and arrow paths are all exquisite. Second Realm cultivation... facing a Third Realm strong enemy, actually leisurely and comfortably, having the upper hand, unharmed!"

After fighting for a while longer, Zheng Dechun roared, actually强吃 a spear through the heart, his two palms slapping towards Li Xian's chest. This was a suicidal killing move, Li Xian originally found it hard to dodge. At the moment of the palm strike, Li Xian's body turned into a流光, dodging several zhang away, avoiding the palm strike, and using light footwork to return to the ground. He甩掉 the blood on the spear body. The Ghost Python spear shone with silver light, having drunk Third Realm blood for the first time, adding to its煞气. Zheng Dechun's eyes dimmed, he tightly grasped the iron chain, held on for a moment, his body无力 and fell, "Bang"一声, crashing onto the ground.

Li Xian didn't dare to be careless. He observed carefully, thinking: "The spear just now indeed pierced his heart. He should be dead, but a Third Realm martial artist... need to observe for another moment."

Hearing the women cheering happily, he felt neither pride nor carelessness. His eyes stared closely at Zheng Dechun's corpse. He picked up ten stones, using the "Vertical Cloud Hand" to shoot them. "Da, da, da" ten sounds, the stones打入穴道, then "Bang"一声 shattered, countless stone fragments密布 inside the body.

Tang Mengluo and the other elders saw his caution and secretly nodded, looking at him with higher regard. They helped to observe and said crisply: "Young friend, this person just entered the Third Realm not long ago. But his martial arts evolution is deep. Although his heart meridian is broken, if he has a life-preserving martial art, it might still be evolving."

Li Xian nodded, plucked a long hair, and sent it with palm wind to the corpse's side, listening for movement and sensing its state. Suddenly his expression changed drastically, and he jumped up. The moment he left the ground, a tender small hand broke out of the earth, but抓了个空.

"Rooting Falling Hair" could transmit hearing and vision, and could also "sense the ground." He sensed movement in the ground, immediately guessing Zheng Dechun was hiding in the earth to approach, and immediately jumped up. If he was a fraction slower, he would have been抓擒.

Li Xian used the Seven Star Step, breaking through the "Qi团", stepping several times in the air, and quickly jumped up several zhang. After rising more than ten zhang from the ground, he observed the ground. Suddenly from the 'East', 'South', and 'North', flying objects shot over. Their momentum was fierce, truly hard to dodge. Li Xian used 'Golden Light' again,闪纵而出, frowning to observe the surroundings.

Suddenly he heard "Bang"一声, the 'Zheng Dechun' corpse shattered, light green poison mist drifted and逸散ed. A voice came from all sides: "Good小子, you are indeed厉害. I Zheng Dechun was killed by you once! This is 'Bone Dissolving Blood Swallowing Poison', it will spread upwards, covering the gorge. If I guess correctly, you must be here to save these women, right? Hahaha, among these women, is there perhaps your lover? Making you risk your life to save them. This mist spreads, they will have no way to live, bones turning to water, flesh turning to soup... their beautiful faces will all消亡, all because of you. Hahaha."

"If you discard your long spear, cut off your own hands and feet, and gouge out your own eyes and ears, I might be able to recall the poison. How you choose depends on you."

Li Xian asked: "You are so bold. These women were captured by He Wentian with great effort. If you poison them to death, can you end well?" Zheng Dechun said: "Hmph, Lord He anticipated this. If there is any anomaly, he would rather poison everyone to death than let a single one escape."

All the women felt a chill, shouting curses. Li Xian said: "What a good He Wentian, truly vicious and ruthless!" Then he smiled confidently: "Unfortunately, unfortunately, although the poison plan is狠, it is useless to me." He secretly used 'Xun Wind Breath', gathering Qi in his belly, cooking and refining it,蓄起 a thick清气.

Zheng Dechun cursed: "Selfish小子, good, then let you try!" The poison mist spread rapidly,蔓延 upwards. The stone chambers at lower positions were gradually covered. The women were terrified, holding their breath and closing their eyes, only hoping to hold on for a moment.

Li Xian had蓄势 enough. He opened his mouth and吐出雾. The white mist spread forward, like a gale, suppressing and eliminating the poison mist... This凶难 was resolved in an instant. A woman praised: "Good method, good method!"

Luo Feiyan suddenly felt it was familiar. Her eyes locked on Li Xian's figure, muttering: "Could it be, could it be him! His name was Hua Manlou, why is he called Li Xian? He... he is so strange, so hard to fathom. This... this little thief..." Her pretty face flushed slightly, her mood complex. Thinking back to their past encounter, being tricked and made a fool by Li Xian, she actually didn't feel resentment or anger. Remembering the communications of the past few days, Li Xian's words were frivolous, making her heart flutter.

When the white mist covered him, the black turbidity on Li Xian's face散尽, his long hair飘飘, his face like jade, the red mole on his forehead very eye-catching, heroic and dignified. Luo Feiyan sighed: "Speaking of elegance, I'm afraid no one can match him. This person is as cunning as He Wentian, always loving to扮丑 and hide, extremely hateful. This清气 has the ability to remove filth and dissolve turbidity. That's why it is revealed now. But it's a good method; how else could he潜入 the enemy camp?" Her gaze was痴痴, unable to look away for a moment.

Now his full appearance was revealed, his charm reaching a higher level: body touching the white mist,气质 ethereal, face flawless, body挺拔, spear凌厉, intention soaring to the sky.

The women couldn't move their eyes. It was a good while before they gradually recovered, their hearts worrying even more. They hoped the young master could remain safe.

Zhao Chunxia was surprised again and again, her eyes containing奇芒,痴痴凝望, muttering: "So it's such a young master who corresponded and talked with me. He looks like this originally..." Tang Mengluo and the other elders seeing him for the first time were also moved. Li Xian, wrapped in white mist,悬 in mid-air, staring intently at the ground.

He thought silently: "Zheng Dechun's corpse was destroyed, his heart pierced. How could he live again? How could the corpse turn into poison?" Li Xian捻发丝 again, sending it into the earth. Rooting Falling Hair, first探知 the situation in the earth,确定无恙, then stood beside the hair. Observing the changes in the earth around.

Zheng Dechun jumped out of the earth, but saw his figure矮小, hands and feet short, like a child, attacking with both hands. But his ability had greatly decreased. Li Xian raised his spear to block, fighting for a while. The second and third Zheng Dechun broke out of the earth. All were矮小, attacking left and right,夹击 front and back, forming a formation.

Each Zheng Dechun was not as capable as before, their appearance very怪,酷似幼童, but each different. One had short hands and short legs, one had long hands and short legs, one had short hands and long legs. The one with short hands and short legs was eloquent. The one with long hands and short legs had powerful palm force. The one with short hands and long legs was incredibly fast. They formed a formation, making them even more difficult to deal with!

It turned out...

Zheng Dechun's fist and foot skills were shallow. He had guarded the "Prison Girl Gorge" since childhood, rarely went out, and his experience was only ordinary. But his martial arts formed a unique sect: "Self-Marrying Self-Giving Birth Sect". This sect was very strange. It required possessing [Heavy Yin Appearance], and cultivating three martial arts to great success.

He Wentian said: "With this sect, even if a Fourth Realm martial artist attacks strongly. You can still defend this Prison Girl Gorge!"

First martial art: Health Nourishing Skill · Mandarin Duck Eating Poison Skill. This skill aims to use poison to nourish the body. Taking it daily, poison resistance becomes very strong. After death, the Mandarin Duck Eating Poison Skill reverses, and the accumulated poison reverses and surges back.

Second martial art: Male-Female Combined Appearance Skill. It is a rare martial art, requiring [Heavy Yin Appearance]. This is an internal cultivation skill, aiming at "recovering Qi and restoring the origin". When practiced to a high level, one can "self-marry self-give birth", enjoying pleasure alone, and can also "give birth to oneself".

Third martial art: Bone Moving Life Transforming Palm. The palm force is阴毒, a move for torture.

Although the three martial arts are strange and peculiar, if gathered in one body, resonating and merging with each other. Then it becomes the "Self-Marrying Self-Giving Birth Sect", capable of having miraculous effects: one body two lives, body transforms into three sons, old body turns to poison, kills without a trace.

After Zheng Dechun was killed, the Mandarin Duck Eating Poison Skill was still evolving, his consciousness still existed. At this time, the "Male-Female Combined Appearance Skill" and "Bone Moving Life Transforming Palm" resonated and evolved. The Bone Moving Life Transforming Palm was used on himself, moving his entire skeleton, recombining the bones into three child bodies. The Male-Female Combined Appearance Skill顺势 "gave birth to oneself", allowing one body to transform into three sons.

Combined with "Technique Path · Earth Escape", hiding in the earth. The Mandarin Duck Eating Poison Skill reversed, the remaining残躯 turned into poison. In this way, there was such a miraculous effect. The old body died, the new three sons were born. One male, two females.

Because the bones were different, the three sons had different figures. The three sons潜伏 in the earth, forming a certain诡阵. Truly, strange moves came out one after another, extremely difficult to deal with. The old body turned to poison, the poison mist弥漫. Even a Fourth Realm martial artist, if lacking corresponding methods, would either狼狈 flee or die on the spot.

This sect also required one key point: it needed to reach the Third Realm of martial arts, otherwise the martial arts evolution would be insufficient, and the sons would easily "die in the womb". That's why Zheng Dechun's cultivation was just at the beginning of the Third Realm, guarding the Prison Girl Gorge, rather than being used elsewhere. He Wentian utilized everything fully, calculating everything properly.

One of the sons attacked suddenly, using both palms in the "Flying Dragon Searching Cloud Claw".

Li Xian凝息 a shock, his body起乌芒, operating "Iron Copper Body" to硬抗, matching the "Ghost Entangling Body" characteristic of the Mischievous Ghost Spear. Between the "Black Light" of the Iron Copper Body, ghost shadows burst out, the back turned青紫色, even more solid and thick. He强吃 a claw and was still fine.

Zheng Dechun spat a curse, deeply feeling Li Xian had too many methods. He潜入 the earth to circle. Li Xian's long spear shook, the ground "Dong Long"一声, dust flew, and a large pit actually sank around him.

Zheng Dechun's martial art sect was indeed exquisite. But after one body transformed into three sons, the three child bodies were incomplete, their strength and ability greatly reduced. Auxiliary technique paths and formations... barely made up for the defects. Even more诡异, but Li Xian's "great strength" was奇,正好克制 this formation.

Li Xian's long spear used as a staff on the ground, while integrating the essence of "Gang Thunder Finger" into the spear body. The moment he used the spear as a staff, it was like sounding a "Thunder Drum", the chest drum thunder sound透入 the earth. Combined with fierce strength, penetrating into the ground.

After several times, the three child bodies were originally incomplete, and were震伤 again. They couldn't stay in the earth anymore, each窜出 ground, begging for mercy: "Great hero, spare me, spare me... I admit defeat... admit defeat."

Li Xian saw the opportunity, kicking the spear tail with one foot. The Ghost Python spear shot out悍然, piercing the three Zheng Dechun child bodies. The force was huge, the long spear "Dong Long"一声,钉在 the gorge wall. Zhao Chunxia and the others' stone chambers shook.

Several women "Ah"一声 and stepped back, all terrified: "This strength...骇人!"

Li Xian killed the strong enemy, then observed for half an incense stick's time.确定 Zheng Dechun was indeed dead, slightly松了一口气.

[First kill of a Third Realm martial artist, Mischievous Ghost Spear proficiency +153]

[Proficiency: 6599/35000 Perfect]

Li Xian searched Zheng Dechun's残衣, finding a circle of玄匙, which was the key to unlocking the "Pipa Lock Bone Chain". Li Xian thought: "In this way, my crisis should be resolved. Although this battle involved many calculations, it wasn't really strenuous. But I must not be arrogant. Zheng Dechun lost to me entirely because he was cunning but not smart, and his vision was narrow. Once restrained, he lost his footing. If it were a strong opponent, I'm afraid I wouldn't have won so easily. Well... after a rest, I will go save people."

He cupped his hands to the women: "Everyone, I will rest for a while, then save you. Please don't panic." He sat cross-legged on the ground, internally cultivating [Five Organs Avoiding Turbid Yang Meeting Meridian].

[Proficiency +1]

[Five Organs Avoiding Turbid Yang Meeting Meridian · Strong Organ Chapter]

[Proficiency: 11236/24000 Great Success]

The women saw rescue was imminent, greatly delighted and grateful. They all looked at him, not daring to make noise to disturb him. They signaled to each other to be quiet. If someone made a noise, they would be glared at by others.

Li Xian nurtured for a moment, first saving "Lin Aoshan". Lin Aoshan was naturally extremely delighted, jumping to hug him. Li Xian saw many eyes watching, originally wanting to avoid. But he was born not knowing how to refuse a woman's embrace, sighing softly, thinking: "Li Xian, Li Xian, it's not怪夫人 wants to gouge out your eyes, you..."

He gently patted Lin Aoshan's back, comforting her softly. Lin Aoshan said happily: "Little Li, our friendship in the府城 is still deep. You... you actually risked your life to save me." Finished, her pretty face flushed.

Li Xian thought: "The people I risked my life to save are many." He said: "You rest for a moment, then come help later." Then he climbed along the cliff wall, saving the other women.

The women were all out of their cages, naturally overjoyed. Ji Hui and others were grateful but speechless, but before they could speak, Li Xian had already gone to another place. They looked for a long time, feeling lost, unable to talk.

When saving Luo Feiyan, Li Xian smiled: "Feiyan sister, since parting in Embroidery City, we meet again!" Luo Feiyan thought of her past embarrassment,嗔道: "You... strange man, daring to say, are you good or bad, what are you plotting again."

Li Xian pretended to be sad and said: "I risked my life to save you, you... you..." Luo Feiyan's heart softened, "I'm... I'm sorry, I... I..."

Li Xian smiled: "Just kidding. About Embroidery City, don't talk nonsense. Otherwise I'll tie you up again and throw you somewhere else." Luo Feiyan blushed: "That kind of thing, I... I wouldn't talk nonsense everywhere. You strange man, daring to do but not daring to admit, afraid I'll ruin your reputation?"

The women were all saved. Those with better strength helped save their companions. Those with weaker strength sat and rested. Hundreds of iron chains formed "Mandarin Duck Knots",悬 in the high air.

After the women recovered their internal Qi, their light footwork was not bad, walking on walls and roofs was no problem. Dozens of women were all saved. Ji Hui stared at Li Xian for a moment, suddenly remembering her master, "Ah"一声惊呼, using light footwork, stepping on walls and walls, flying to the stone chamber where her master was.

Ji Hui asked: "Master, are you alright?" The sorrow and resentment were now消散. Zhao Chunxia smiled: "Naturally fine." Ji Hui said: "I'll unlock you for you."

She tried to open the玄铁栅. But Zhao Chunxia was拘束 by the Pipa Lock Bone Chain, even if the iron栅 was open, she couldn't take a step. Ji Hui was just at a loss when she heard footsteps behind her.

Li Xian called: "Ji sister, let me do it." Ji Hui惊喜道: "Ah, it's... it's you." Sensing her失态, she quickly said: "Young hero, thank you so much, please save my master quickly." She didn't even look at her master, just stared at Li Xian.

She paused, both shy and curious: "You just called me Ji sister, you know my name? Have we met before?"

Li Xian casually said: "I heard Wang Long mention you." He thought: "It's natural for me to call someone sister. If we really talk about it, I might have to call her sister." He had no other intention towards Ji Hui, his attitude casual, the word "sister" had no ambiguity.

He turned his head and cupped his hands: "Senior Chunxia, I'm here to save you!" Zhao Chunxia smiled and looked at him,轻轻 nodded, her face slightly异, her gaze不住 closely examining.
