# Chapter 264: Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique

Xu Yunfan sighed. "He died miserably. He's turned into a dried-up corpse."

As he spoke, he shifted slightly to the side.

"Do you want to go in and take a look?"

Teng Lingchuan's expression faltered slightly, and he couldn't help but say coldly, "Lead the way!"

"That can be arranged."

Xu Yunfan's voice was drawling. "Have you cultivated the Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique? If your blood energy isn't thick enough, you'll be sucked dry too."

"Nonsense," Teng Lingchuan coldly retorted. "The Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique is a mandatory cultivation method for true disciple of the Nine耀 Sect. Of course, I've learned it. Now, lead the way!"

"It's just like being sleepy and someone hands you a pillow."

Xu Yunfan let out a low chuckle, his figure closing in like a phantom.

*So fast!*

Teng Lingchuan's pupils constricted sharply. He wanted to retreat and dodge, but Xu Yunfan's five fingers shot out like a dragon leaving the sea, clamping onto his shoulder like an iron pincer.

Teng Lingchuan was just about to struggle when he felt a scorching force seep into his shoulder blade, instantly sealing the blood energy throughout his body.

His legs went weak, and he almost fell to his knees, but Xu Yunfan grabbed him by the back of his collar and lifted him up.

"After practicing for so long, you still haven't improved. You haven't even perfected the training of muscles, bones, and skin, yet you've recklessly entered the Outer Three Unions. Did you come to this secret realm to die?"

Xu Yunfan leaned close to his ear, his voice carrying a hint of gloom. "Your Tianquan Peak's chief disciple, Zhou Tianyan, just became nourishment for the Blood Sacrifice Jade. You're quite lucky you didn't go in with him. Sometimes, being weak is an advantage."

Teng Lingchuan was terrified to the core, but his body couldn't stop trembling, cold sweat soaking his inner garments.

*When did Xu Yunfan become this strong? I can't even dodge him.*

*Zhou Tianyan... he's probably really finished in there.*

He was merely following orders to provide support for Zhou Tianyan outside. He never expected to run into Xu Yunfan. He thought he could easily handle him, but he didn't realize a true dragon had just flown out of the White Jade Palace.

"Brother Xu, Brother Xu, spare me! I... I was just following orders..."

Under the threat of death, Teng Lingchuan forced a smile onto his face, filled with a sycophantic flattery he had never shown before.

"Brother Xu, w-we are friends who met through conflict. Is this necessary? Let's sit down and talk this over slowly."

"Enough废话."

Before Teng Lingchuan could say more, Xu Yunfan carried him and leaped onto a cliff outside the palace, casually throwing him to the ground.

Clouds and mist churned below the cliff, and the faint roars of beasts could be heard from the distance. It was the perfect place for an interrogation.

He crouched down, a wisp of Red Python Vital Force igniting at his fingertips as he waved it in front of Teng Lingchuan. "I ask, you answer. If there is a single lie..."

The vital force suddenly turned into a crimson flame, shooting up high and scorching much of Teng Lingchuan's hair, reflecting his terrified and distorted face.

"What is the general secret formula for your Nine耀 Sect's *Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique*?"

Xu Yunfan got straight to the point.

Teng Lingchuan's heart tightened. He opened his mouth, his face showing a troubled expression. "Th-this is the sect's core secret. I once swore a terrible oath that I would never pass it on without the permission of my elders. Brother Xu, how about we discuss something else..."

"Oh?"

Xu Yunfan flicked his finger, and the Red Python Vital Force, like a venomous snake, burrowed under Teng Lingchuan's skin.

Teng Lingchuan immediately let out a blood-curdling scream, his whole body convulsing. A spiderweb of crimson patterns appeared under his skin, as if magma were flowing through his veins.

"I'll talk! I'll talk!"

Teng Lingchuan cried out in pain, tears and mucus streaming down his face. He had been smooth sailing since he was a child, with exceptional talent. His master, Yin Hong, had said his aptitude was no less than Zhou Tianyan's.

Having never endured suffering before, he couldn't withstand the erosion of this foreign vital force. The pain felt like being flayed by ten thousand knives.

"The general formula is 'The Nine耀 revolve, swallow the heavens and absorb the earth, qi penetrates the starry sky'... B-but later, you need to cultivate in conjunction with the sect's secret 'Nine耀 Star Chart,' otherwise you will suffer a backlash!"

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes.

This secret formula matched the energy circulation patterns he had observed on Zhou Tianyan, but it was clearly just the surface level.

He let out a cold laugh and pressed his palm against Teng Lingchuan's Dantian. This was a major acupoint where meridians intersected, capable of causing bone-deep pain. He forcefully activated his Pure Yang One Qi Art, and his pure yang internal energy, like molten rock, instantly seeped into Teng Lingchuan's flesh and meridians.

"Ah!"

Teng Lingchuan let out a piercing wail. His flesh and blood felt as if they were being burned by a branding iron, and his blood energy frantically leaked away.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's expressionless face, Teng Lingchuan knew that if he hesitated any longer, he would be tortured to death.

His face twisted, his voice hoarse, he recited the Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique in full.

*You have gained a slight understanding of the Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique.*

Watching as the words "Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique (Not yet mastered)" appeared on the skill list of his status panel, and with an even more detailed explanation of the technique flowing through his mind.

"So that's how it is..."

Xu Yunfan murmured.

The essence of the Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique was to forge the blood energy like tempering steel, constantly compressing it to improve its quality. It was remarkably similar to his Red Python Coiling Mountain Force.

However, the Nine耀 Sect had clearly hidden the crucial parts very deeply. Ordinary disciples could never access the true teachings. If not for the status panel, he would never have known these things.

Although Teng Lingchuan was called a true disciple, his cultivation of the Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique was half-baked at best. Many of the critical points were not explained clearly at all.

He let go, and Teng Lingchuan collapsed like mud, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, his eyes filled with despair, his muscles and flesh convulsing uncontrollably.

Xu Yunfan picked him up again, looking at Teng Lingchuan with cold eyes.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's icy gaze, Teng Lingchuan struggled frantically.

"Wait, wait! I have more to say! I know other secret martial arts of the Nine耀 Sect! What I cultivate is the Nine耀 Ten Capital True Force! It can gather primal true qi, pointing directly to the Ninth Realm of the Unsurpassed Qi Cultivation!"

"Oh?"

Xu Yunfan's eyebrows raised slightly.

"The Nine耀 Ten Capital True Force?"

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred, and the Red Python Vital Force at his fingertips subsided slightly.

He had indeed heard of this technique. It is one of the core secrets of the Nine耀 Sect. Legend has it that upon reaching great perfection, one can condense the "Ten Capital Star Evil," transforming force into qi. The resulting true qi is endless and points directly to the peak of the Ninth Realm of the Martial Path.

Seeing that Xu Yunfan seemed interested, Teng Lingchuan hurriedly said, "This technique requires the Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique as its foundation. If blood energy is divided into nine耀, then lighting one耀 is an achievement. When all nine耀 are perfected, the force generated by the blood energy is like a surging tide or a galactic river hanging upside down. The force and qi are nurtured like rivers, giving birth to true qi. Its power..."

Before he could finish, Xu Yunfan suddenly let out a cold laugh. "Unfortunately, you haven't even lit three耀."

He had already used his pure yang internal energy to probe the other's blood energy. This man's blood energy was impure, and his force was scattered. It was mostly from consuming pills and flesh without fully refining them.

Teng Lingchuan's face fell drastically. He wanted to say more, but Xu Yunfan had already lost his patience.

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel suddenly swept across. The nine layers of cloud-fire patterns on the cudgel's body erupted with azure lightning, like a red dragon devouring a throat, instantly shattering Teng Lingchuan's flesh.

*Pfft!*

Teng Lingchuan's chest caved in, and blood mixed with fragments of his internal organs spewed out.

He stumbled backward, his eyes filled with disbelief. "You... you aren't greedy for martial arts..."

"Greed?"

Xu Yunfan flicked the blood off his cudgel, his tone indifferent. "You'll tell me anyway. I might even leave you a sliver of a chance to live."
