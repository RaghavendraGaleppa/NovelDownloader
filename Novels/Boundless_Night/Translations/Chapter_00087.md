# Chapter 87: Heavenly Talent

Crimson Cloud City, majestic and towering, shone as bright as day.

Qin Ming bathed in the warm spring breeze as he returned safely. Just then, he saw a team of experts leaving the city, their gleaming armor resembling a torrent of steel as they marched into the distance.

In this region, there was no Mountain Lord, making the City Lord's Manor the most powerful entity. The sudden appearance of high-level aberrations in the distance immediately alarmed the city's forces. Although top-tier aberrations like the Spirit-Communing Jade Rhinoceros and the Black Flood Dragon resided deep within the mountain range, they never dared to challenge Crimson Cloud City's authority. Usually, both sides coexisted peacefully, neither allowing high-level combatants to cross into the other's territory lightly.

Soon, the small group of new cultivators who had been blocked by aberrations on the road all returned safely.

Wu Zheng happened to see Qin Ming returning to the inn and greeted him, "Brother Qin, did you just get back from going into the mountains alone? I'm about to go out; let me bring back dinner for you."

"How did you get injured?" Qin Ming noticed that Wu Zheng's neck and hands were bandaged, with slight traces of blood seeping through.

Wu Zheng looked disheartened, sighing with his head down, "I've also been going into the mountains these past few days. Four of my companions died. My archery and spear skills are decent, so I managed to escape. Sigh, it's too difficult to obtain spiritual substances in the great mountains."

This was the reality; many new cultivators had to risk their lives to advance further.

Back in his room, Qin Ming, out of caution, discarded the "White Jade Powder," a powder specifically for men used to mask strong body odor. He had no unusual scent on him; he had merely used it deliberately after assuming a new identity for his trip into the mountains. Afterward, he took a hot shower and changed into clean, dry clothes.

"Brother Qin, I brought back some beef patties and a few home-style dishes. I'm not sure if they'll suit your taste," Wu Zheng said after knocking and entering.

The seventeen-year-old youth, who had been full of vigor and aspirations for his future when he left Black-White Mountain, now looked dispirited and injured due to continuous setbacks. Wu Zheng's eyes were slightly red, clearly having cried recently.

"Do you want some more?" Qin Ming asked.

"No, I already ate my fill outside," Wu Zheng shook his head.

"Then go to your room and consume this," Qin Ming took out the jar of spiritual substance he had bought at a very low cost from Wu Yiyi of the Serpent race.

Wu Zheng was puzzled. He took it, opened it, and saw the liquid flowing with spiritual radiance. He was instantly shocked, realizing what it was. "Brother Qin, this... it's too valuable. I can't accept it," he quickly covered the jar, worried about spiritual essence loss.

"Take it, I'm giving it to you. First, enhance your physique; other problems will be easy to solve," Qin Ming said, pressing it into his hand.

Wu Zheng was a year older than him but always called him "Brother Qin," showing genuine warmth. Moreover, Qin Ming had learned the Wu family's twin arts of spear and arrow, and he could easily resolve the youth's difficulties, so he was willing to help him.

"Brother Qin!" The seventeen-year-old Wu Zheng's eyes welled up with tears. He nodded heavily and then left with the spiritual substance.

After dinner, Qin Ming began to inventory his gains. Looking at the three blood-stained ancient books, he could imagine the life-and-death scenes associated with them. Once one entered the great mountains, they were not just hunters but also prey. Even if they had a "story" (past achievements or notable background), dying in the mountains meant everything ended.

Today's experience was rather bizarre. He hadn't expected the Purple Lightning Beast to have such a prominent background, or that the aberrations in the mountains would offer him such grand gifts just to curry favor with it. He couldn't help but laugh, having encountered it twice. He estimated that the Purple Lightning Beast must have been fuming, practically about to explode. "Next time, don't let me run into you again." He certainly didn't want to encounter the Purple Lightning Beast again; if he were recognized, it would undoubtedly lead to a violent "storm."

Qin Ming felt no guilt. When he first met the Purple Lightning Beast, it had leaped through the air and struck at his head; any other new cultivator would likely have died. Regardless of its noble race or formidable background, it was still a dangerous creature of the mountains. Most of the time, they were prey to each other, often fighting to the death. Qin Ming found it hard to empathize with the feelings of aberrations.

"Grass-Skimming." Qin Ming first picked up the secret manual on leg techniques, looking at the three characters on the cover with anticipation. He studied it diligently. After a long time, resonating with the residual emotions of the author and combining it with his own comprehension, he completely grasped the essence of this secret technique. The entire book primarily focused on evasion. By activating a special "Wind Force," one could move as swiftly as the wind, their body exceptionally agile. In short, it was a life-saving method. This leg technique also contained offensive moves, but they were limited in scope and not its main purpose. Qin Ming felt that *Grass-Skimming* was very interesting; he was just missing such an escape technique.

He picked up the second secret manual, *Body Tempering*. This was a cultivation method for enhancing physical strength, practicing a type of "Tempering Force" to refine the body to be as hard as refined gold. Qin Ming focused intensely, resonating with the residual emotions, and coupled with his extraordinary comprehension, he understood the true essence of this cultivation method.

The third book, bound in golden beast hide, was named *Golden Light Shield*. As the name suggested, this was a body protection technique that channeled Heaven's Light to form a layer of golden light on the body's surface, protecting oneself. When cultivated to a profound realm, the golden light would radiate outwards, far beyond merely covering the body's surface. Qin Ming's heart trembled as he saw the founder's power: after that female cultivator trained the Golden Light Shield to its highest level, the dense golden light was thicker than a city wall! "How formidable!" he exclaimed. No wonder Bai Xi of the Spirit-Communing Jade Rhinoceros race initially hid it; they must have planned to sell it for an exorbitant price later.

The Golden Light Shield could not only protect oneself but also project terrifying Heaven's Light outwards from the dense golden light, annihilating surrounding enemies. Qin Ming believed this cultivation method was extremely valuable; its "Golden Light Force" was definitely a powerful composite force technique. "I wonder if this *Golden Light Shield* and the *Vajra Armor* can be fused. If they could ultimately merge into one, their power would surely skyrocket." He was very much looking forward to it.

Qin Ming didn't just bring back these three books; there were also several beast hide scrolls that didn't resonate with his spirit. However, with his sufficient comprehension, he wanted to try practicing a few more himself. Soon, though, he frowned. Secret manuals bought from outside really couldn't be practiced indiscriminately. There were pitfalls. The first ten pages were fine, but practicing further caused his qi and blood to churn, making him extremely uncomfortable. He quickly used the method from the silk scroll to regulate himself, slowly exhaling a turbid breath, and then tossed these books aside.

One trip into the mountains to obtain *Grass-Skimming*, *Body Tempering*, and *Golden Light Shield* was more than enough. Adding Ge Qianxun's *Vajra Armor* and Ning Siqi's priceless and extraordinary technique *Li Fire Scripture*, he had enough to study and practice for the short term. If he could digest all these secret manuals, his strength would definitely improve significantly!

Afterward, Qin Ming held the yellowish-brown stone in his hand and examined it carefully. It was only palm-sized and had some mysterious patterns on it. Upon contact, his Heaven's Light became restless. When he used the Yellow Earth Palm, the Heaven's Light's attribute changed accordingly; it wasn't a soft force, nor was it a hard force taken to the extreme softness, but a thick, majestic yellowish-brown Heaven's Light Force. This was the power of the silk scroll method: it could integrate various Heaven's Light forces, transform into a single type of force, or even transform into the most suitable Heaven's Light force along the path of a specific extraordinary technique.

"An essence stone condensed from underground earth veins!" Qin Ming knew what it was. It wasn't recorded in the secret manual for the Yellow Earth Palm, but during his emotional resonance, the old man had muttered about such a peculiar stone. He was instantly excited. Cultivating the Yellow Earth Palm to a profound realm was extremely difficult, at least requiring Heaven's Light to be emitted outwards to improve, as that was when one could capture external spiritual substances like the energy of the earth. Now, Qin Ming had obtained a peculiar stone formed from earth vein essence, which could accelerate this process. He knew how terrifying the Yellow Earth Palm was when cultivated to its highest realm: striking giant beasts the size of small mountains was like swatting flies, its soft force could transform into a hard force, and it could absorb the essence of the earth, sweeping away everything in its path. Although this peculiar stone was far from allowing him to reach that level, it could definitely significantly enhance the palm technique, giving him another incredibly destructive palm art.

Over the next few days, Qin Ming diligently cultivated. Except for the *Li Fire Scripture*, the most difficult extraordinary technique, which he hadn't yet studied, all his other techniques were progressing, and he had initially cultivated Heaven's Light force. Especially the Yellow Earth Palm; after completely absorbing the essence from the peculiar stone, faint yellow mist emerged from his fingers when he performed the palm technique. When he tried it out, a large peculiar stone placed in the courtyard immediately crumbled into powder, and the rockery also collapsed.

The innkeeper was furious, pulling him to demand compensation. Qin Ming didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so he quickly handed over the Day Gold and told him that it was the black-clothed man from the City Lord's Manor who often visited that did it, and he shouldn't spread rumors.

"Then I don't want compensation."

"No, please, keep it. You must accept the compensation; it's only right."

...

Two days later, Meng Xinghai sent someone to find Qin Ming.

In the City Lord's Manor's living room, calming incense wafted from the censer. Meng Xinghai handed him four pages of paper, his expression serious, and told him to comprehend them on the spot. Qin Ming was puzzled but took them. After a short while, he put down the papers and went into the courtyard to practice.

"How does it feel?" Meng Xinghai came out to ask shortly after.

"I feel like I'm about to cultivate my first wisp of Heaven's Light force," Qin Ming replied.

"That fast?!" Meng Xinghai was once again surprised. This young man seemed to bring him surprises every time, his comprehension so high that Meng Xinghai couldn't maintain a calm demeanor.

"I've always been a fast learner. Many people in the Cui family knew that," Qin Ming said.

Meng Xinghai composed himself, regaining the composure befitting an elder and a City Lord, and nodded, "Hmm, this is an introductory section of a certain legacy that has circulated outside. If you can quickly get started, you can then cultivate the main part of that rare extraordinary technique. Since you are very suited to its path, I will set aside my old face and ask two of my friends to help me try to acquire this cultivation method for you."

Qin Ming said, "You're only in your early thirties, still in your prime, a golden age for ambition. How can you say 'old face'? A youth like me is still at an ignorant age and needs Uncle Meng's considerable care."

Meng Xinghai chuckled, "You rascal, trying to charm me, aren't you? How about... I adopt you as my godson?"

"Uncle, you're not that much older than me, are you?" Qin Ming noticed that Meng Xinghai seemed very busy; many people came to find him in just a short moment. Soon, he knew what had happened.

After Meng Xinghai thoroughly investigated and combined the intelligence gathered from Ge Qianxun, he discovered that the Golden Robbers actually had many secret businesses in Crimson Cloud City. Evidently, the Golden Robbers had long sensed something was amiss and wanted to quickly withdraw from those businesses, thus absconding with all their assets. Meng Xinghai knew he couldn't wait any longer; he had to act, not allowing them to escape with the funds. He understood that such an action would undoubtedly invite retaliation and counterattacks from the Golden Robbers. While they might not dare to directly harm Meng Xinghai or Crimson Cloud City, they would likely cause trouble in the surrounding areas.

"Uncle Meng, I need to return to Black-White Mountain temporarily!" Qin Ming sprang to his feet. He knew very well that if the Golden Robbers sought revenge for Meng Xinghai's actions, they would undoubtedly target the Black-White Mountain region. Especially since he had personally wiped out Golden Rooster Ridge, that hatred might be particularly noted by the Golden Robbers.

Since embarking on the path of a new cultivator, Qin Ming had progressed smoothly, achieving breakthroughs along the way. He felt it was time to test himself through a major battle, to fight fiercely and withstand the Golden Robbers' assault on that remote area where he once lived!
