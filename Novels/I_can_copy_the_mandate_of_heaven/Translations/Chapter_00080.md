## Chapter 80: Da Niu

Li Zhiming had been searching for Da Niu for what felt like an eternity, scouring the premises of the Seven Mystic Gate sect. As night began to fall, his hopes were dwindling, and he found himself sitting in a wooded area halfway up the mountain, catching his breath.

The darkness made it difficult for him to see, and Li Zhiming's thoughts were a jumble. He had seen so many disciples of the sect lying dead, some of whom he had even tried to save. The sight was heartbreaking, and Li Zhiming wasn't sure how to process his emotions.

Just as he was about to give up, Li Zhiming tripped over a sturdy leg and fell. As he got up, he saw that it was Da Niu, whose body was covered in wounds. Li Zhiming's voice trembled as he called out to Da Niu, relief washing over him.

Li Zhiming quickly administered some medicine to Da Niu, trying to stem the bleeding. Da Niu's condition was dire, and Li Zhiming knew he had to get him to safety. With great effort, Li Zhiming hoisted Da Niu onto his back and began to make his way down the mountain.

As they descended, Li Zhiming tried to keep Da Niu awake, talking to him about their plans for the future, from eating wild chicken to getting married. Da Niu's responses were weak, but Li Zhiming continued to speak, trying to keep his friend's spirits up.

Eventually, they reached a relatively safe location, and Li Zhiming stopped to catch his breath. Da Niu's condition had worsened, and Li Zhiming knew they needed help. Just as he was starting to lose hope, he heard the sound of people approaching.

The crowd that gathered around them was hostile, but Li Zhiming stood his ground, drawing his sword and preparing to defend himself and Da Niu. As the tension escalated, Li Zhiming called out for someone he trusted to come and help them.

Meanwhile, at the peak of the Seven Mystic Gate sect, Su Zongguang sat serenely, his eyes closed, as reports of the day's battles were brought to him. Despite the setbacks and losses, Su Zongguang remained calm, his focus fixed on capturing the main peak.

However, when he received news that Li Zhiming, a mere fourteen-year-old, was holding off his attackers, Su Zongguang's composure was shaken. Enraged, he struck the messenger and decided to investigate the situation personally.

Upon arriving at the scene, Su Zongguang was met with a gruesome sight: a sea of corpses stretching from the outer edges of the forest to the center, where Li Zhiming stood, still defending himself. The sheer number of dead was staggering, a testament to Li Zhiming's skill and determination.
