# Chapter 187: Showdown! Ji Changyu!

Outside the Proud Cloud Secret Realm's outer layer.

Above the many viewing stands.

The atmosphere had already grown heated, with a constant murmur of debate.

A full three months had passed.

This century-old grand event of Proud Cloud Immortal City.

Was finally about to reach its conclusion.

"Judging by the performance in this past month's ranking battles, the top spot in the Foundation Establishment Realm this time will most likely be contested between Chang Jin of the Myriad Spirit Race of the Heavens and Ji Changyu of the Human Emperor's Dao Court."

"It should be so. Those two are simply not on the same level as everyone else; the gap is too wide."

"Don't forget Zhang Jing from the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect; he also has ninety-six victories, no less than those two!"

"He..."

"His number of victories is indeed high, but he just doesn't possess that invincible, unstoppable aura like the other two."

"Exactly, I always feel like he's missing something."

"Maybe he's just hiding his strength?" someone retorted, unwilling to concede.

However.

Almost no one responded.

...

Secret Realm's uppermost space.

"Haha, it seems that this Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud divine ability will likely fall into the hands of my Imperial Brother."

A figure clad in dragon robes, holding a nine-dragon imperial seal, said with a laugh.

Immediately.

Several gazes unconsciously fell upon him, and another terrifying figure shrouded in primordial magnetic divine light.

A slightly sour voice followed.

"Congratulations to you two fellow Daoists!"

"One taking first in Foundation Establishment, another first in Golden Core; the Human Emperor's Dao Court and the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect truly live up to their reputation as the top two immortal Dao lineages. Among their direct disciples, monstrous prodigies emerge endlessly."

"..."

Among them.

The voice of a figure steeped in boundless demonic intent was particularly complex.

This Proud Cloud Secret Realm clearly belonged to their Ancestor Demonic Cult.

Yet, as a result, the two largest peaches had been plucked by disciples of the Human Emperor's Dao Court and the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect respectively.

He didn't care about the so-called innate divine ability.

But if this matter were to spread.

As a dignified immortal great sect, the Ancestor Demonic Cult, where would it put its face?

Wouldn't it bring shame upon the Divine Monarchs and Patriarchs within the cult?

"Sigh~"

All sorts of worries flooded his heart.

Thousands of words ultimately could only transform into a helpless sigh.

Just then.

A violent spatial fluctuation abruptly appeared in this space.

A handsome man then appeared, and directly took a seat among the others.

Behind him.

The anomaly of sunrise and moonrise, illuminating the wilderness, faintly emerged.

"Everyone, that's not necessarily true."

"That young fellow from your Human Emperor's Dao Court is quite capable, but I believe this Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud divine ability has quite a strong affinity with my junior sister, haha."

As his voice fell.

The figure shrouded in chilling demonic intent instantly stiffened.

His worries grew even stronger.

Meanwhile, the laughter of the dragon-robed figure opposite abruptly ceased.

Followed by a cold snort.

"Hmph, fellow Daoist, don't speak too soon. Just watch. I'd like to see if your Taiyin Jade Rabbit Race's innate divine ability can truly withstand the burning of the Human Dao True Flame—"

Before he could finish his sentence.

He was directly interrupted by a voice.

"Haha, indeed, one shouldn't speak too soon. But in my opinion, this Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud divine ability is ninety-nine percent likely to go to Junior Brother Zhang Jing this time."

"Who?"

Seeing his words interrupted.

The dragon-robed figure immediately cast a cold gaze.

However, the next moment.

The coldness in his gaze quietly disappeared, replaced by a hint of respect.

In everyone's sight.

A figure, as if condensed from boundless bronze immortal light, slowly appeared.

Vaguely.

A vast bronze Dao domain descended upon them, within which countless boundless bronze Dao soldiers suddenly opened their eyes and roared in unison.

Buzz!

The entire void instantly began to tremble.

Not long after.

A gaze lightly fell upon Zhang Jing, who was sitting cross-legged in meditation.

"Junior Brother, whether your Senior Brother can benefit from this and enter the core of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm to comprehend the immortal Proud Sun, it all depends on you this time."

...

The next day.

Boom—

Accompanied by a loud bang, the sky suddenly darkened.

On the Heroic Island.

Everyone, including Zhang Jing, simultaneously looked up.

What greeted their eyes was a giant face covering the sky.

"Today is the last day of the ranking battle, and also the day the final rankings will be decided. Each of you still has three battles; I hope you all give it your best."

As he spoke.

From the Secret Realm Spirit's glabella, ten thousand golden lights suddenly flew out, then gathered into a single dazzling golden sun.

"This is today's special reward for the first place, the innate divine ability Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud."

"Now I announce, the last day of the ranking battle officially begins!"

The grand and inspiring voice echoed.

Instantly.

The fifty arenas in mid-air began to revive, streaks of immortal light shot into the sky, and an indestructible aura permeated the surroundings.

Below.

Nearly a hundred gazes involuntarily looked at the golden sun that had just appeared in the sky, then swept over Zhang Jing and the other two.

Most of them ultimately fell upon Chang Jin and Ji Changyu.

Envy almost solidified.

...

In place.

Zhang Jing's gaze also slowly swept over that golden sun.

His eyes were as still as an ancient well.

He didn't know why.

At this moment, being just one step away from his goal.

His heart, instead, became unexpectedly calm.

Three more matches remained!

One against Chang Jin, one against Ji Changyu, and another against Brother Qu Junhou.

There was nothing to worry about.

Nor anything to be excited about.

As long as he won these three matches step by step, he would naturally achieve the desired result.

It sounds... quite simple.

Not long after.

A faint, almost imperceptible sense of summons suddenly appeared in his mind.

Zhang Jing looked up.

He saw his own number 'Yi-One' (B-1) slowly appear on an arena, followed by another number.

Bing-One (C-1)!

"Bing-One, Ji Changyu? Tsk, I didn't expect to run into him right away. How interesting."

A faint smile involuntarily appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

Without the slightest hesitation.

His figure flickered, and in an instant, he appeared on the arena.

...

At the same time.

Yi-One and Bing-One, two numbers ranked among the top three, simultaneously appeared on an arena.

This immediately drew everyone's attention.

Glimpses of curiosity or anticipation came from all directions.

For a moment.

Even the cultivators on other arenas who were preparing to fight couldn't help but stop, turning their heads to look.

Some even simply sat on the stage and started chatting.

"Finally, we can see them go all out. Surely they won't hold back this time."

"It's those two fighting first?!"

"Ah, this arrangement isn't good! Brother Zhang Jing should fight Chang Jin of the Myriad Spirit faction first to see if he can force out her trump cards."

"Then let Brother Ji Changyu, who is stronger, make his move. This way, we can ensure that the first place doesn't fall into the hands of a creature from the Myriad Spirit faction."

"..."

...

In a secluded corner of the island.

"Brother Zhang, you must be careful. Ji Changyu's strength is absolutely far beyond your imagination!"

A hint of apprehension flashed in Qu Junhou's eyes.

...

On the other side.

Several creatures from the Myriad Spirit faction gathered, their gazes constantly fixed on the arena.

When they saw Zhang Jing's figure.

Their hearts involuntarily trembled.

Not long after.

"Hehe, I see those humans don't seem to think highly of that freak. The outcome of this battle will probably overturn their imagination."

"Although Ji Changyu's strength is not as good as that freak's, he definitely has the ability to force out all of his trump cards. Now our Lord can reap the benefits."

"Haha, it seems the Secret Realm Spirit is quite considerate of us. This is practically handing the first place directly to our Lord."

...

On the arena.

A streak of rainbow light flashed.

Ji Changyu appeared opposite, his figure as tall and firm as a mountain.

A domineering aura of "I am the myriad beings" instantly permeated the air.

"Haha, Fellow Daoist Zhang Jing, I've always wanted to truly spar with you to see whether your Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect's methods are more profound, or our Human Emperor's Dao Court's methods are stronger, but I never found the opportunity."

"However, it seems this opportunity came at just the right time."

Ji Changyu's voice was full of strong confidence.

Opposite him.

A faint smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face, and he said softly:

"Please enlighten me, fellow Daoist."

"Fellow Daoist, be careful. My Human Dao True Flame originates from a great divine ability; it burns everything, consumes everything, and is terrifyingly potent. If you sense danger, please quickly concede, otherwise, once it touches you, even the Secret Realm Spirit might not be able to save you."

Ji Changyu warned kindly.

"Thank you."

Zhang Jing nodded upon hearing this.

As soon as his voice fell.

A terrifyingly scorching aura rose from Ji Changyu's body, instantly spreading in all directions.

In an instant.

The air, and even the rich immortal spiritual energy permeating it, began to burn fiercely.

The Dao patterns on the arena began to blur.

The bronze was also slowly melting into glowing red liquid.

Zhang Jing looked around.

He found that everywhere his gaze could reach, scarlet-gold flames ignited, and even...

...it seemed he perceived something.

Zhang Jing quickly closed his eyes.

That bizarre scarlet-gold flame could actually burn towards him along his gaze, which was truly incredible.

"Is this the wisp I saw before, the Flame of Myriad Beings that completely ignited Ji Changyu? The Human Dao True Flame?"

"It truly is terrifying!" Zhang Jing thought to himself.

However, an inexplicable excitement arose in his heart.

Such an opponent... was truly worthy of his full effort!

The next instant.

The Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud rose from above his head, five-colored spiritual light flowing endlessly, radiating dazzling golden brilliance.

As if by divine inspiration.

Prosperity, Boundless Pure Water, Splendid Mountains and Rivers, Utmost Gold and Utmost Firmness, Five Elements containing Dao, Yin-Yang Complementarity...

All the insights gained over these thirty days of participating in the final round of ranking battles.

Intertwined and merged in his mind.

Zhang Jing's expression was neither joyful nor sorrowful.

He saw him gently point forward with one hand.

In an instant.

Various Dao intents spread, intertwined, and woven together at his fingertips!

Ultimately, they even formed a Splendid Mountains and Rivers Diagram, flickering with a hazy spiritual light.

The boundless cosmos models its form, Yin and Yang harmonize to forge its bones, and the Eight Trigrams and Five Elements scatter into myriad phenomena of rivers and mountains!

Buzz!

The moment the Splendid Mountains and Rivers Diagram appeared.

A terrifyingly oppressive aura wildly surged in all directions.
