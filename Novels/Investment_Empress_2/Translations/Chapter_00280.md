# Chapter 280: How Did They Get Even Stronger? (1/2)

Inside the Five Elements Realm.

"Could they have killed each other in there?" Zhi Duo Luo thought it wasn't impossible.

If that were the case, while he might be able to obtain the Jade Phoenix God, he would miss out on the True Dragon Bloodline and the True Phoenix Bloodline.

He wanted all of these things.

The other half-demons were also eager and couldn't wait to go inside and investigate.

But Zhi Duo Luo decided to wait a little longer, making the half-demons prepare their formations.

The battle between Wu Mo and Luan Bing, even if it hadn't ended, must be nearing its conclusion.

The demonic beasts present, who had been quiet at first, had now started to chatter amongst themselves.

They were completely unaware that several half-demons had already slipped away from the crowd and were lurking in the shadows.

And at that very moment...

*Rumble, rumble—*

The myriad phenomena in the sky began to roar, like a thunderclap on a clear day. Then, all the phenomena converged towards the peak of the solitary mountain.

A single thought arose in the hearts of all the demonic beasts.

The Heavenly Jade... has chosen its master?

Outside.

Monk Huai Kong suddenly clasped his hands together and softly chanted a Buddhist name. "My merit in the Southern Domain is now complete."

The golden wheel of wisdom behind his head seemed to flicker and flash once more.

He raised his head, but saw Shang Qinqing's face. The former Demon Saint had long since lost her smile.

Huai Kong didn't dare to look at her, so he could only turn his gaze to the sky.

But the scene at the peak of the solitary mountain caused all eyes looking at it to fall into a daze. The vast courtyard of the main hall of the Suspended Temple fell silent in an instant.

"In the end, who did the Jade Phoenix God belong to?"

"Hiss, look at their state. The fight just now must have been intense."

...

So, I accidentally got her little feet dirty just now, so it's perfectly reasonable to help her wipe them, right?

Student Li felt that one must have the courage to take responsibility for their actions.

So he decided to help her wipe them properly.

Who knew the more he wiped, the more there was...

And the more there was, the more he wiped...

Until just now, perhaps even the Jade Phoenix God couldn't stand it anymore, it voluntarily retracted its light and flew into Ying Bing's brow.

There wasn't even time to complete the refinement.

"I think our Supreme Flood Dragon must have gotten the Heavenly Jade!"

"Don't be ridiculous, a so-called True Dragon Bloodline was beaten until his face was covered in blood."

"The Azure Luan Goddess is just pretending to be calm. Look at her, a so-called True Phoenix Bloodline, she can't even stand steadily. Does she look like someone who got the Heavenly Jade?"

The ordinary demonic beasts, unaware of the truth, began to argue about the situation.

Just then...

*Screech—*

A piercing cry tore through the air.

A dozen or so figures shot into the sky. It was vaguely visible that the leader among them was surrounded by a ferocious golden roc, its wings covering the sky and the sun.

The half-demons had made their move!

They were revered as 'Gods' for a reason.

When they attacked, they not only possessed an inexplicably powerful bloodline power, but it also contained the true meaning of human martial arts!

"You're both exhausted, aren't you?"

"When the Dragon and Phoenix fought, did you ever think that the one to laugh at the end would be me, Zhi Duo Luo?"

"Hehehe!"

He moved too quickly. The long blade in his hand was like a golden roc's wing, or a sky-cleaving saber, domineering and ruthless.

The sudden change in the situation came too fast.

Not to mention the demonic beasts present, even the Demon Kings and Great Demons outside couldn't react in time.

"Fortunately, I changed back in time."

"Otherwise, the Supreme Flood Dragon's reputation would have been ruined..."

Li Mo had just thought this when he felt a sharp killing intent fall upon him.

He instinctively pulled the girl behind him, and a golden light like glazed jade lit up on his body.

*Clang!*

Zhi Duo Luo's Demonic Weapon long blade seemed to have struck a great bell, its sound echoing like a grand bell that refused to fade.

"You... you guys... aren't..."

He was completely numb, his voice trembling.

But the next moment, it wasn't just his body that was numb.

---

The eyes locked onto him were clearly filled with murderous intent amidst their coldness...

The other half-demons who were attacking paused, wondering how the solitary peak in the Five Elements Realm had suddenly become so cold.

And snow had started to fall?

Moreover, there was another ice sculpture...

To hell with the ice sculpture, that was Zhi Duo Luo!

For a moment, the half-demons looked as if they had seen a ghost.

"Let's go together! They're just putting on a show, they're actually completely drained!"

"They can't fight against so many of us!"

"If we join forces, even an Inner Scene expert would fall here!"

There were other demonic beasts outside, so leaving now wasn't an option.

The half-demon from the Qiongqi clan, who had wings on his back, suddenly let out a tiger's roar around him. The Qiongqi phantom above his head, having absorbed the incense offering that drifted from his body, suddenly swelled by two sizes.

It was as if a pure-blooded Qiongqi had truly descended.

Its tiger eyes opened, and it looked ferociously at Ying Bing, letting out a roar:

*Meow...*

The Qiongqi God-son: "?"

The situation of the other half-demons couldn't be said to be similar; it was exactly the same.

"The phantoms just now absorbed... incense offering?"

The Flood Dragon Li Mo grabbed a unlucky snake half-demon and knocked him out with a headbutt, his mind racing.

This reminded him of the Wu Spirit Festival that day.

It seemed... that True Spirits could indeed become stronger through the faith of others, and so could the Soul of Intent. For example, the method of viewing oneself as a god was about using the beliefs of others to nourish one's own Soul of Intent.

Hmm...

But compared to the Ice Cube, it was like the difference between a firefly and the bright moon.

She had just obtained the Jade Phoenix God, and just by releasing a trace of her Soul of Intent's aura, she naturally possessed a majesty that surpassed all other demons.

The so-called divine will of these God-sons was inherently suppressed.

Seeing this, the avian clans all cheered, while the aquatic clans had complicated expressions.

The girl's aura was like that of a ruler over ten thousand demons. How could they not understand?

The Azure Luan Goddess would now represent the Heavenly Jade.

Moreover, as long as she didn't fall, she would be the尊主 (Respected Lord) of all demons in the Southern Domain in the future.

But with her splendor, who could object?

Among the monks of the Suspended Temple, Monk Huai Kong was as if a great burden had been lifted.

Shang Qinqing remained silent, her joyful eyes tinged with complexity.

"Our Ming蛟 clan's days are going to be difficult from now on," Wu Qing said gloomily.

"Wife, I don't think so," Master Murong Feng stroked his beard and said with a smile.

Wu Qing looked at her husband in confusion, but saw him smiling without a word, playing his mysterious game again. So she went to pinch his waist.

"Ouch... Wife, let go, this isn't the place to talk..."

The various demonic beasts were all discussing amongst themselves, but they had no intention of helping.

Because it wasn't necessary.

By the time they got there, the battle would probably already be over.

...

At the same time.

Inside the Five Elements Realm, this battle had indeed come to an end.

Zhi Duo Luo had just broken free from the ice when he saw a hammer coming at him.

He could never figure out in his dreams why these two were even stronger than before they had fought each other.

He only had time to say:

"My Holy Sect..."

Before he could finish his sentence, the shadow of the hammer grew large before his eyes.

This hammer drew a final conclusion to the battle for the Heavenly Jade.

"You think I'll let you go report back?" Student Li哼了一声 (snorted), and put away his hammer.

He stood in place for a moment.

He couldn't help but fall into deep thought, feeling like something was missing.

That's right.

The Jade Phoenix God was already with the Ice Cube.

"Where's my investment return?!"
