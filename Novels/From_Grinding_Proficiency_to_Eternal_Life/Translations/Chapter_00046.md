# Chapter 46: The War Drum瓮金 Hammer

Xu Yunfan stepped over the thin, unmelted frost on the bluestone slabs and suddenly stopped.

Looking back, the courtyard was densely covered with footprints from practicing the Flying Hair Leg, each one as smooth and defined as the edge of an inkstone. This was undeniable proof that he had perfected the Muscle Refining stage.

Next, he urgently needed to find a martial art in Qingzhou that specialized in Bone Forging. As long as he broke through to the Three-Training Martial Master realm—perfecting his muscles, bones, and skin alike—then even if the Shocking Tide Sect came to settle accounts, he wouldn't care even if he admitted to killing that vicious girl right to their faces.

For eight full days, he hadn't taken a single step outside the courtyard gate. His meals were left at the door by the Long Wind Tavern for him to collect. During the day, swinging the Cloak Hammer produced gusts of wind that never ceased, exhausting him from morning till night. At night, he sat cross-legged, forming the Seal of Lin with his hands and chanting the "Supreme Goodness is Like Water" Heart Mantra.

On his attribute panel, the proficiency for the Red Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer increased steadily. It wasn't exactly flooding the screen, but the progress was quite substantial.

Until the eighth night, when the Vajra Guardian statue on the altar suddenly cracked in two with a *crack*.

"..."

Xu Yunfan's eyes snapped open. He was so startled he nearly kicked a hole right through the wooden floor.

A system notification floated across his retina: "Unlucky aura has dissipated."

He was just one step away from success, yet this damned statue couldn't hold on. It left him feeling frustrated and stuck in limbo.

However, the Technique of Lin really did have some profound effects. Although he hadn't fully mastered it, his mind was clear and his senses sharp. His five senses felt as polished as a new mirror, and even the killing moves of the Thirty-Six Forms of the Red Chain Cloak Hammer flowed much smoother than before. Looking at the hammer techniques now was like looking at an open ledger; he knew perfectly well which move should use seventy percent of his strength and which stance hid a follow-up.

Unfortunately, Li Haomiao was right. The spiritual energy of this world seemed to be out of sync, the primordial spirits extinct, and the secret powers of heaven and earth hidden. If not for the attribute panel, he wouldn't even have been able to touch the edge of the Technique of Lin.

Snow began to fall in the latter half of the night. Xu Yunfan slept soundly, wrapped in his quilt. When he pushed the door open at dawn, fluttering snowflakes were swept into his collar. The entire courtyard was wrapped in a silver-white blanket, the weight of the snow bending the branches of the lone old tree. He raised his hand and caught a goose-feather-sized snowflake, which instantly melted into a water mark.

He was now at the second stage of training, his muscles and skin having reached the human limit. With just a slight activation of his blood energy, his body felt as hot as a furnace. The snow in the courtyard was deep enough to bury his calves.

"Master Xu! The hammer you ordered is ready!"

The apprentice's grating voice came from outside the courtyard wall. Hearing this, Xu Yunfan happily headed over.

Inside the blacksmith shop, sparks were flying everywhere. Beside the furnace, the apprentice was pumping the bellows with all his might, causing blue flames to spew out. Lu the Blacksmith was bending over, dragging a heavy object out of the fire. Seeing Xu Yunfan enter, he quickly shouted, "Great Hero, give me a hand! This thing is as heavy as a coffin lid!"

The moment Xu Yunfan caught the heavy hammer with one hand, the muscles and tendons all over his body instinctively tensened into a hard bow. The hammerhead was as big as a washbasin. The black, high-quality steel surface was studded with thirty-six wolf-tooth spikes gleaming with cold light. A lion head held nine copper rings in its mouth. The six-foot-three-inch handle was wrapped in gold-threaded python sinew, and the end had a three-inch-long armor-piercing spike.

"I mixed in my reserve of meteorite iron sand just to successfully forge this War Drum瓮金 Hammer," Lu the Blacksmith said, wiping his soot-covered face. "Twenty years ago, I could have forged this into a treasure that cuts through iron like mud..."

The old man suddenly choked up, as if remembering some incredible past event. He stared blankly at Xu Yunfan, who was constantly adjusting to the feel of the War Drum瓮金 Hammer.

Xu Yunfan didn't respond. He lifted the hammer and gave it a light shake. The nine linked rings clanged loudly, shaking dust loose from the roof beams. With just a slight movement of the hammer, a gust of wind arose, and the icicles under the eaves shattered with the sound.

Xu Yunfan's heart itched with anticipation. If the blacksmith shop weren't so cramped, he would have loved to practice the Red Chain Cloak Hammer with this heavy weapon.

Lu the Blacksmith's eyes were full of nostalgia, the furnace fire flickering in his sunken eye sockets. "Back when I was an apprentice at the Divine Weapon Ridge... I saw Master Ou Yezi's true disciple forge a blade from meteorite iron. When the blade was completed, a hundred-zhang waterfall flowed upstream. Unfortunately, my talent was limited, and for my entire life, I never forged a weapon of the Sharp Blade level. As for your weapon, even though I added meteorite iron sand, it's only at the peak of the Mortal grade."

The nearly sixty-year-old Lu the Blacksmith swallowed the rest of his words.

"It's a fine weapon!" Xu Yunfan said with deep emotion, turning to express his thanks. "It's already excellent. In North Ye City, probably only you, Lu the Blacksmith, could forge such a heavy weapon."

Lu the Blacksmith shook his head slightly, his face full of melancholy. "You don't understand. In the trade of forging weapons, I haven't even touched the threshold yet."

"How much is it?"

Hearing that the main topic was coming up, Lu the Blacksmith immediately perked up. "One thousand six hundred taels of silver."

"Good!" Xu Yunfan agreed without the slightest hesitation. The boost this War Drum瓮金 Hammer gave him was far greater than he had imagined. One thousand six hundred taels of silver for a suitable heavy weapon was an incredible bargain.

The money and goods were exchanged, and just as Xu Yunfan was about to leave, Lu the Blacksmith suddenly lowered his voice. "Young man, the martial art you practice is the Red Chain Cloak Hammer, isn't it?"

Xu Yunfan's expression changed subtly. He turned around abruptly, holding the War Drum瓮金 Hammer. His tall, iron-tower-like body seemed to take root in the ground. Even the apprentice pumping the bellows couldn't help but shiver at the sight, freezing in place.

Seeing this, Lu the Blacksmith shouted, "Keep stoking the fire! If the temperature drops, I'll throw you in!"

The apprentice, terrified into silence, didn't dare to hesitate. He flexed his muscles and began pumping the bellows with all his might.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes. He naturally realized that Lu the Blacksmith was showing goodwill, indicating that he had no other intentions.

"Old master, how did you know?" Xu Yunfan's voice was calm. The Lu the Blacksmith before him, who was only at the minor success stage of Skin Refining, seemed to have an extraordinary background. It made sense. If he were an ordinary blacksmith, how could he possess martial arts skills and do business with martial artists?

When he first practiced the Red Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer, Li Haomiao hadn't told him the origins of this technique, only saying that he found it in the Great Zhou Martial Arts Treasury. It seemed there was more to the story.

Lu the Blacksmith chuckled. "This瓮金 Hammer, if you had taken it to any other blacksmith shop in North Ye City, getting a weapon that looks like this would have been considered good enough. It's just that you ran into me. Otherwise, you would have wasted a lot of time on this weapon."

Although he had just mocked himself for not even touching the true threshold of forging, compared to the other blacksmith shops in the city, his skill was naturally second to none.
