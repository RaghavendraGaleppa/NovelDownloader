**Chapter 7: Spells and Divine Abilities**

"That's right! If you wish to master divine abilities, you must cultivate your spells to perfection during the Qi Condensation stage! Our Qingheng Sect's Master perfected three spells before reaching the Foundation Establishment stage! After achieving Foundation Establishment, he rarely met an opponent of the same cultivation level!"

Mu Sen's smile broadened as he observed the disciples' astonished expressions.

"Three perfected spells??"

"That's incredible!"

The disciples' eyes widened upon hearing this. It was truly astonishing! Three perfected spells!

Some of them were senior disciples, not newcomers. They profoundly understood how difficult it was to perfect even one spell, let alone three.

"Three perfected spells!"

"If only I could find magic tools that come with perfected spells," Zhang Yan muttered, a fiery glint in his eyes.

Perfecting spells was extremely important to him. And, because of his equipment slot, the conditions for him to achieve it might be simpler than for ordinary cultivators.

"I must master at least one spell before Foundation Establishment!"

As this thought settled, his gaze grew resolute.

"Cultivating spells is quite challenging. It's good that you know this, but whether it's Foundation Establishment or perfecting spells, these are still far too distant goals for your current selves." Mu Sen gently nodded, seeing the disciples now looking as if they'd been pumped with stimulant, and then began his lecture. "...Only those with exceptional comprehension can benefit from them. Ordinary people wouldn't even notice."

"Since you can sense it, it indicates your comprehension is good. Alright, these meditation mats cost ten contribution points each." Generally, these mats were not for sale. But in Mu Sen's view, Zhang Yan could sense their ability to enhance comprehension. Thus, his own comprehension must be quite good. If that was the case, then what was usually impossible became possible. That was just how this world worked; so-called rules would always yield to one's aptitude and strength.

"Thank you, Teacher!" Hearing Mu Sen's words, Zhang Yan quickly transferred ten contribution points.

Then, he unhesitatingly walked over to the young girl.

"Excuse me, fellow cultivator, I'm buying this meditation mat."

"????"

Hearing Zhang Yan's words, not only the girl but even Mu Sen twitched his mouth.

Mu Sen now seriously suspected that this boy's pretense of buying a comprehension-enhancing mat was false; his true intention was to use the opportunity to strike up a conversation with the girl!

"You!" The girl's face flushed with embarrassment.

"There are so many mats here, can't you take another one?"

"No!" Zhang Yan declared without hesitation. What a joke. He, Zhang, was not some random person! He wanted *this specific* mat. Other mats didn't have the effect of achieving great completion in the Wood Elemental Art!

"You!"

Thinking of this, he unhesitatingly equipped the Wood Elemental Alchemy Cauldron.

In an instant, the alchemy cauldron vanished. A stream of information flooded his mind.

"So this is alchemy, this is fire control!" Zhang Yan exclaimed.

"Hmm?"

"Wait!"

Suddenly, Zhang Yan noticed something amiss. He had equipped the Wood Elemental Alchemy Cauldron, but the cultivation jade slip hadn't been unequipped!

He closed his eyes. Immediately, two equipment slots appeared in his mind.

"What's happening?"

"There's an extra equipment slot!"

Zhang Yan's eyes widened. He had only ever had one equipment slot, but now there were two!

"Is it because I've reached the Qi Condensation stage?"
