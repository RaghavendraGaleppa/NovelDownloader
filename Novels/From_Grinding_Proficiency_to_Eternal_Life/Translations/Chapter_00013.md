# Chapter 13: The Heart Mantra of the Highest Good is Like Water

Most people in this biting wind hugged their arms and shivered.

Ningguta was located at the extreme north of the Northern Frontier, its environment incredibly harsh. During the depths of winter, temperatures could plummet to minus sixty or seventy degrees Celsius.

To be exposed in such an environment would quickly lead to loss of body heat and death.

Fortunately, it was not yet the heart of winter.

Not far away, the several people suppressed by Xu Yunfan all wore numb expressions. When they noticed Xu Yunfan's sweeping gaze, they were like quails, not daring to utter a word.

Bullies who prey on the weak but fear the strong.

Xu Yunfan snorted coldly, recalling the scenes of these men strutting around arrogantly and domineeringly in Yujing. They had frolicked through every pleasure house in the city.

Li Haomiao, carried on Xu Yunfan's back, stared blankly at the frozen wasteland ahead and could not help but sigh.

"A silk ribbon seals eight hundred miles, a frozen plain lies across three thousand rivers. The extreme north truly lives up to its reputation. When I was in Yujing, I wanted to see the extreme north, and seeing it today, it is indeed worthy of its name."

Xu Yunfan asked, "Didn't you see it when you were escorted here?"

"I was in a coma the entire time."

Just then, Yang Gan's rough and indifferent voice rang out.

"You are all granted three days of leave. The stone house next to you is your residence. Not far away is a hot spring where you may bathe. You are not to enter any other areas without permission. Violators will be executed."

No one dared to speak. With the crowd, they walked toward the stone house, and Xu Yunfan followed silently.

However, he could clearly sense Yang Gan's cold gaze sweeping over him several times.

"You've killed us," Li Haomiao naturally understood what Xu Yunfan meant, a faint smile appearing on his face.

Xu Yunfan glanced back. Li Haomiao's smile crinkled the three hideous scars on his face, making them look incredibly terrifying and twisted.

Inside the stone house, they finally got a bowl of hot food—a vegetable paste. After drinking it, they went to the hot spring to wash themselves clean.

After soaking himself thoroughly, Xu Yunfan was about to leave when he suddenly saw Zhou Feng, whom he hadn't seen for a long time, not far away.

Beside Zhou Feng stood a sturdy man with long, disheveled hair. The two were whispering to each other.

Zhou Feng looked up and saw Xu Yunfan's gaze. His expression shifted slightly before he turned his head away.

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly and gave up the idea of going up to greet him.

His attention was mostly on the man beside Zhou Feng. He was certain he hadn't seen this man in the mine.

Because they were quite close, he could clearly see that the man's fingernails were not stained with the mineral dust that comes from long hours of mining labor.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes. This guy had sneaked in.

Li Haomiao, watching from the side, whispered, "It seems you are quite sharp."

Xu Yunfan lowered his voice. "You knew earlier?"

"This is the best opportunity. Too many factions have gathered here, and it is also the best opportunity for that wicked woman to wipe out the rebels in one fell swoop."

Li Haomiao's eyes were deep. "Find an opportunity to take me out. Very soon, very soon, things will change."

It seemed that Zhou Feng had actively contacted someone and learned this information.

Xu Yunfan pondered. If not for Li Haomiao's information, he would only have a vague feeling that something was wrong by now.

Then he reacted.

"I take you out?" Xu Yunfan pointed at himself, somewhat dazed. "You're talking about me?"

Li Haomiao said calmly, "Why not?"

"I don't have such great ability. Don't drag me into your court struggles."

Li Haomiao said, "I can teach you the朝阳一气诀 (Chaoyang Yiqi Jue). Once your muscles, bones, and skin are fully trained, use the Chaoyang Yiqi Jue to unite the three external forces, and from the outside in, train your flesh, blood, marrow, and qi. This is a peerless divine art of this world."

"Teach it to me first."

"Given your temperament, you would likely abandon me without hesitation once you get it."

Xu Yunfan said solemnly, "Your Highness the Yan King, your eyes are mistaken. I am an upright man, truly honest and trustworthy, consistent inside and out, open and aboveboard. How could I easily break my promise?"

Li Haomiao just gave a "hehe" and said nothing.

Xu Yunfan was helpless. This guy was also the type who wouldn't part with anything unless he saw a rabbit. That Chaoyang Yiqi Jue must be incredibly precious. If he missed this chance, he might never get such a good opportunity to obtain a divine art so easily again.

After soaking in the hot spring for a while longer, Xu Yunfan carefully observed the surrounding miners and was somewhat surprised.

"There are quite a few people practicing martial arts."

Li Haomiao said indifferently, "Most of them are from official families or high-ranking households. What's so strange about practicing martial arts? If not for that, how could all the overseers be skilled in martial arts?"

His face was ruined, and three of his limbs were broken. The originally famous Prince Yan was unknown to anyone here.

What caught Xu Yunfan's attention most was a youth of about his own age in the adjacent hot spring, whose eyes were darting around everywhere.

The lean muscles on his bare upper body were enough to show he had been practicing martial arts for quite some time.

"Eh, it's Fang Mushan, the son of the Grand General of Supporting the State."

Li Haomiao's expression was filled with emotion as he sighed, "Half the ministers in court have probably become that wicked woman's victims. The Grand General of Supporting the State, Fang Wen, was a staunch supporter of the late emperor. He is probably imprisoned in the imperial prison now. This boy has incredible talent for martial arts, practicing the浑天枪法 (Huntian Spear Technique), and has a unique natural gift. Don't look at his frail appearance; his strength is world-shaking. Even the late emperor praised him as a genius capable of fighting above his level."

He paused and said softly, "When the time comes, we can follow him. With him leading the way, we will be the safest."

Xu Yunfan gave a thumbs-up. "When it comes to selling people out, you are the best."

"..."

Late at night, nearly thirty stone houses were almost filled with people lying on straw piles.

Outside, the north wind howled, and even a slight gust felt piercingly cold.

In a corner, Xu Yunfan faced the wall with his ten fingers interlocked, index fingers touching, silently reciting the Heart Mantra of the Highest Good is Like Water.

The "Lin" character formula obtained from that human skin bag was a technique for refining the mind and spirit.

It carries the meaning of "facing a situation," representing physical and mental stability. It means not losing composure when facing a situation, maintaining an unwavering will, and showing a strong physique and will.

In the cultivation of the mysterious gate, it is often used for psychological adjustment before entering a state of stillness and tranquility, helping practitioners eliminate distracting thoughts and concentrate their minds, so as to face the various tests and challenges in cultivation with a firm will.

At the same time, during battle, reciting this character can help one remain calm and steady, making correct judgments.

This is a wondrous technique for assisting cultivation.

It can stabilize the mind, strengthen the will, and bolster the spirit.

According to the explanation of this "Lin" character formula, if the "Lin" character is cultivated to its extreme, all external disturbances will not touch one's body. One can sense everything around them in an instant, accept a massive amount of information in a short time to make the most effective judgments, and then make decisions.

A terrifying ability. According to the templates of fantasy novels, it makes one fearless of all illusions, allows one to merge with the heavens and earth, and enter a state of enlightenment, thereby improving cultivation efficiency.

It can truly be called a supernatural power.

Xu Yunfan suppressed his excitement and silently recited the Heart Mantra of the Highest Good is Like Water, clearing his mind and entering an empty, bright state.

*You are practicing the Lin character formula, reciting the scripture, but it seems you are not doing it quite right. You ponder it carefully, yet you cannot grasp the key.*
