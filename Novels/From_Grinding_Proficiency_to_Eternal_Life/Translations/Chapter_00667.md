# Chapter 667: So Direct Right from the Start? That’s a Bit Much

This was the Nine Abyss Mysterious Evil, Dongming True Lord.

Back then, one could barely make out this True Lord’s features, but now, he could see them almost clearly.

It was a world of difference.

Seeing Xu Yunfan enter, her red lips curled into a smile that could make mountains and rivers lose their color. Her voice carried a hint of laziness and a straightforward temptation. "True Lord of the Celestial Thunder, Daoist Friend Xu. Mm, truly a peerless genius, heroic and spirited."

"I observe that your true yang is abundant. The thunder of the Celestial Thunder is the utmost yang, while my Nine Abyss Mysterious Evil is the utmost yin. The union of yin and yang is the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth. Why don't we practice dual cultivation? It would be of great benefit to both of our cultivation levels."

Her gaze was burning, her words without any concealment. Her eyes roamed over Xu Yunfan without restraint, as if appreciating a rare treasure, and also evaluating his value as a furnace鼎.

Xu Yunfan paused his steps.

Although he had long expected that the True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect acted without taboos, especially this Dongming True Lord, who was famous for playing with people's hearts, he hadn't expected her to be so direct and bold.

His thoughts raced, but a playful smile appeared on his face. He was neither angered nor embarrassed by this naked proposal. Instead, he casually raised his hand as if to undo his belt, his movements natural, as he stepped forward.

"Oh? Dongming True Lord speaks quite directly. However, is it a bit too hasty to be so frank upon our first meeting? But..."

He paused his words, his gaze meeting hers without avoidance, the very eyes that seemed to be able to penetrate everything. The golden core of the Celestial Thunder trembled slightly, a majestic and upright thunderous pressure faintly emanating from him. Purple-gold thunder patterns flowed beneath his Daoist robe.

"What the True Lord says is not without reason. The thunder of the Celestial Thunder, which shatters all laws, is yang and firm. The Mysterious Evil of the Nine Abyss, which perceives the netherworld, is yin and dark. When yin and yang interact, the vast firmament can then bear the ten thousand transformations. If we can mutually verify the Great Dao, this Lord would not mind seeking guidance on the True Lord's Mysterious Evil techniques."

He showed neither fear nor lust. It was more like a negotiation between equals, with a calm and confident air of "I can handle this, and I am interested."

To be honest, dual cultivation with a True Lord—although his Celestial Thunder method distinguishes between yin and yang and operates the Five Element Divine Thunder, Dongming True Lord cultivates the path of Mysterious Evil, which complements him. Dual cultivation would be good for both.

At the same time, he was rapidly calculating the pros and cons in his heart.

Ultimately, it was a question of who would overwhelm whom.

The other party was a veteran True Lord of the initial Golden Core realm. Her accumulation of cultivation must be profound, and her Nine Abyss Mysterious Evil power could indeed stimulate and temper his Celestial Thunder body. It might even help him stabilize his Golden Core realm faster and comprehend the principle of yin and yang generating each other.

On the surface, this deal didn't seem like a loss.

But more importantly, he needed to use this opportunity to get closer and pry open her mouth.

Dongming True Lord, upon seeing this, flashed a hint of surprise in her eyes, which then turned into even stronger interest and appreciation.

This newly promoted True Lord before her was indeed extraordinary. Not only was his Dao heart firm, but his skin was also thick enough, and his response was flawless.

She let out a charming laugh, her jade hand lightly waving. The cold, sharp spiritual sense that filled the hall and attempted to probe Xu Yunfan's mind receded like the tide.

"Interesting, truly interesting! True Lord of the Celestial Thunder speaks directly and wins my heart. Since that's the case..."

The thin gauze on her body stirred without wind. Threads of exceptionally pure Mysterious Yin Evil Qi, seemingly from the origin of the Nine Abyss, capable of freezing the soul and eroding spiritual power, began to spread. It formed a faint standoff and attraction with the purple-gold thunder patterns on Xu Yunfan's body that were automatically protecting him.

A cultivation verification at the level of Golden Core True Lords thus began.

There was no worldly romance. It was more like two completely opposite yet subtly complementary Great Dao laws colliding and blending, meticulously verifying each other.

In the hall, the roar of thunder intertwined with the hisses of the Nine Abyss.

The domineering and unparalleled purple-gold Celestial True Thunder attempted to tear apart and purify the thick, cold Mysterious Evil with every flash.

While the deep, ink-black Nine Abyss Mysterious Evil was like a bone-gnawing maggot, infiltrating through every possible opening, attempting to freeze the wildness of the thunder and continuously trying to probe and analyze the indestructible Dao rhyme at the core of the thunder.

The qi of yin and yang, amidst the intense conflict, miraculously produced a kind of resonance and transformation. Threads of opposing qi were born and annihilated at the most intense points of collision.

Xu Yunfan's mind was highly focused. He operated the "Celestial Nine Firmaments Vast Firmament Indestructible True Sutra" to its utmost, pushing his body and golden core to their limits. He had to resist the erosion of the other party's Mysterious Evil power and the strange Dao rhyme that could see through people's hearts, while also drawing from it the supreme principle of yin and yang mutually generating and restraining each other, to temper his own spiritual power and stabilize his Golden Core realm.

He could clearly feel that with every intense clash between thunder and Mysterious Evil, his control over his own Celestial Thunder power became more refined, and his understanding of the inclusive imagery of the Vast Firmament Indestructible bearing the heavens grew deeper.

This imagery of his was naturally grand and required an extremely resilient soul to bear it.

As the saying goes, tempering the indestructible amidst endless destruction, nurturing new life within the destructive thunder.

The Vast Firmament as the body, the Thunder Pool as the furnace, the Star Flame as the seed, the cycle of life and destruction, unchanging for ten thousand generations.

Naturally, it is for one's own eternity.

What is eternity? It is to be stronger than others.

Dongming True Lord's Nine Abyss Mysterious Evil was like an extremely cold whetstone, making his thunder's edge even more condensed and pure.

Dongming True Lord was equally surprised in her heart.

Xu Yunfan's foundation was far more solid than she had estimated.

The golden core, forged from the legendary ninety-nine strands of immortal golden nature, contained a domineering and unparalleled destructive power. The imagery of his Vast Firmament Indestructible was also incredibly resilient. Her Nine Abyss Mysterious Evil could not truly erode its core.

What startled her even more was the other party's extreme calmness and control. Even in this intimate fusion and confrontation of laws at the Dao level, his mind was like bedrock, difficult for her to completely stir or see through the key points.

He actually managed to maintain his own inner world from being breached.

This caused her evaluation of Xu Yunfan to rise several notches. (I think you all know what I'm implying here.)

Several hours later, the violent energy fluctuations in the hall gradually subsided.

Xu Yunfan had already reorganized his clothes and crown. His purple-gold Daoist robe was spotless, his hair bun was immaculate, and his expression was calm and composed, as if the intense clash of laws from before was just a normal discussion on the Dao.

Only the occasionally swirling, even deeper and more introverted purple-gold lightning in his eyes showed the gains from this exchange.

He adjusted his clothes, looking scholarly and refined, and cupped his hands. "Daoist Friend Dongming's methods are profound. The Nine Abyss Mysterious Evil perceives the subtle, allowing this Lord to benefit greatly and gain much insight into the principle of yin and yang complementing each other. This 'discussion of the Dao' was truly exhilarating."

"I wonder, besides verifying the Great Dao, what else did the True Lord invite this Lord here to discuss?"

He cut straight to the point. Since they had already been so frank with each other and their relationship had advanced, there was no need for further pretense.

Dongming True Lord had also donned a dark palace gown and was leaning lazily on a soft couch. Upon hearing this, she covered her mouth and chuckled, her eyes shimmering with a thousand charms.

"True Lord of the Celestial Thunder, you've already pulled up your pants—oh, I mean, you've straightened your clothes and don't recognize people anymore? Why the rush?"
