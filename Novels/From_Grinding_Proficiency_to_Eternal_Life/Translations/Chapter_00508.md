Chapter 508: Gorging

The two fruits eaten at noon today had no flavor to speak of, and Sun Wukong couldn't even recall their taste now. He was consumed by thoughts of them.

The thought flashed through his mind, and an expression of unbearable craving immediately appeared on Sun Wukong's face. He scratched his ears and cheeks, saying, "Aiya! Just talking about it is making my mouth water. That tree is hanging with so many fruits, red and fragrant. We are honored guests, and we are also the ones who toiled for the Master. The Taoist Lord treating us to a few is building good karma, and treating us to a few more would just be proper hospitality. I say, that Taoist Lord must be a good host; how could he be so stingy?! Come on, come on, it's a good night for doing things. Let's go get a few more to satisfy our craving. I'll take responsibility if the Master finds out."

Wuneng and Wujing exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with both desire and a hint of hesitation.

Sha Wujing hesitated, "Big Brother, this... I'm afraid it's not appropriate? The Master already strictly forbade us from having any more wild ideas."

Wuneng swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Although he was desperately craving the fruit, he was also worried, "Brother Monkey, after all, this is the True Lord's sacred grounds. If we steal... I mean, pick more, won't we anger them?"

Sun Wukong immediately glared, putting on a look of frustration with their lack of backbone.

"Hey! You two cowards! What 'stealing'? This is called 'harvesting'! We've been traveling all day and haven't eaten a single grain of rice; our bellies are hungry and thirsty. This garden full of fruit is for quenching the thirst and satisfying the hunger of honored guests. We, the martial brothers, just entered the Taoist temple today and haven't even had a single meal or cup of tea yet. Can they really just let us starve to death?! Go on, go on, I'll take the blame! What's there to be afraid of?!"

Of course, Sun Wukong hadn't tamed his Monkey King heart. With just a little provocation, his wild nature came right out.

Meanwhile, Xu Yunfan was making precise calculations.

"The locations of the four core Immortal Peaches are already memorized in my heart. I must have Wukong acquire them as quickly as possible. As for the others... the more we can pick, the better. Whether it's for me to condense the foundation of my Divine Arts or for Wukong's clone, these Gang and Sha energies are incredibly useful!"

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but let out a breath.

It all ultimately comes down to one's foundation.

Look, a True Lord from the Primordial Origin Sect can create such a fuss. Low-level cultivators fight until their heads are broken and blood flows for a mere wisp of Heavenly and Earthly Gang-Sha. The rich feast on meat and wine while the poor freeze to death on the roads.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh. He wondered when he would be able to kill a great rich man and enrich himself.

Back at the Taoist temple, goaded by Sun Wukong and tempted by the delicious fruit, the few reservations Wuneng and Wujing had were instantly dispelled.

"Alright! Let's do it!"
"Listen to Big Brother!"

They responded in unison, their eyes glowing green.

As demons, even though they had been taken in as disciples by Tang Sanzang, their fundamental nature wasn't easily changed. Besides, it wasn't like they were killing or committing arson; they were just eating some fruit. What's the big deal?

Around midnight, under the dim moonlight, three figures slipped out of the guest rooms silently and, familiar with the way, sneaked back into the central courtyard where the Immortal Peach tree was planted. The gnarled, ancient peach tree appeared even more mystical in the night. The flowery, luminous peaches among its branches and leaves were like stars, emitting an enticing fragrance and a pure, primordial fluctuation of Gang-Sha energy.

Sun Wukong had already locked onto his targets. His movements were as fast as lightning, and he didn't need to search carefully like the two童子, Clear Breeze and Bright Moon, had during the day. His figure leaped a few times between the branches, and his claws flew, precisely snatching the four peaches that respectively contained the auras of 'Divine Skies Purple Mansion Shattering Heavenly Gang,' 'Nine Palaces Purple Firmament Suppressing Hell Earthly Sha,' 'Supreme Purity Clear Source Cleansing Demon Sha,' and 'Zhou Heaven Dipper Pivot Splitting Golden Gang.' In the blink of an eye, he swallowed them into his stomach.

Before they even reached his mouth, these four fruits were transmitted via the Yunji Huyi Method to Xu Yunfan's hands, billions of miles away. Since the Pureyang Ancestor had severed the karmic ties with a single, unstoppable sword strike, there was no need to worry about any consequences.

With the four essential Heavenly and Earthly Gang-Sha he desperately needed secured, Xu Yunfan's mind relaxed.

Meanwhile, Sun Wukong's actions didn't stop. He continued to grab and stuff them into his mouth like crazy. Wujing and Wuneng, watching from the side, were dumbfounded. They had just said they would pick a couple of peaches, but now he was frantically stuffing them into his mouth.

Sun Wukong urged Wuneng and Wujing as he ate, "Hurry, hurry! Pick more, the opportunity won't come again!"

He himself worked even more frantically, his two monkey paws turning into a flurry of afterimages, specifically targeting those peaches with dense Sha energy, which were clearly of superior quality.

*Crunch! Crunch!*

The ripe peaches were roughly plucked and then shoved into Sun Wukong's mouth, juice splashing everywhere.

Wuneng and Wujing followed his example, scrambling up the tree trunk with hands and feet, greedily harvesting the luminous fruits. Especially Wuneng, who, taking Sun Wukong as his model, never stopped opening his mouth. He'd pluck one and immediately stuff it in.

"Delicious! So delicious!" he mumbled incoherently. The earth-yellow and water-blue Sha energies around him churned violently, even leaking from his mouth and nose, and his stomach grew even rounder.

Sha Wujing was relatively more restrained, but he couldn't help swallowing two peaches. The black water Sha energy on his body's surface surged powerfully, almost forming a tangible water shield.

But Monkey King Sun Wukong's consumption was even more exaggerated. He not only swallowed a large number of Heavenly and Earthly Gang-Sha peaches containing different attributes without chewing, but he also didn't stop at all. The energy around him churned violently, like a chaotic furnace brought to a boil.

Suddenly, wisps of sharp, incisive Gang-Sha energy, as if capable of tearing space itself, shot out from his pores like silver needles! The explosive, raging Nine Heavens Thunderfire Sha, crackling with purple-white electric snakes, coiled around his monkey fur. The thick, condensed Cold Sha, like ten-thousand-year-old ice, frosted his feet. The scorching, violent Fire Sha turned his golden fur slightly red, making his whole body glow with a golden light, an extremely eye-catching sight.

There were also various other Heavenly and Earthly Gang-Sha energies of different attributes mixed together, forming a multicolored Sha storm that enveloped his entire form. Sun Wukong subconsciously circulated the Battle-Buddha True Scripture. As his magic power surged, it was continuously absorbed, refined, and expelled by his formidable battle physique.

He knew in his heart that the Battle-Buddha True Scripture required only Golden Gang-Sha energy. Now that he had eaten fruits of other attributes, they naturally couldn't be easily refined into his magic power foundation. Only his Innate Dao Embryo's physique could contain them.

For a moment, the scene was that of a demon god refining its golden body by devouring the primordial Gang-Sha energies of heaven and earth.

This was precisely Xu Yunfan's intention.

Sun Wukong was naturally cautious in his heart, but he couldn't resist Xu Yunfan's secret machinations. With so many fruits, once he started eating, Xu Yunfan could employ many methods. Now, Sun Wukong was forcibly containing multiple primordial Gang-Sha energies far beyond his current realm, and it was natural that the external phenomena couldn't be completely suppressed.

How could such a huge commotion and the continuously leaking pure Sha energy fluctuations possibly瞒过 the people within the temple?

Wujing and Wuneng, watching from the side, looked at this audacious monkey with utter horror.

"Big, Big Brother, isn't this a bit too much?" Wuneng's eyes were darting around, already calculating where to retreat.
