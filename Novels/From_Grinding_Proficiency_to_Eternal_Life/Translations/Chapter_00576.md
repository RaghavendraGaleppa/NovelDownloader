# Chapter 576: What's the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls? This is My Banner of Starry Skies

The shadow of death hung over the three of them like a heavy leaden cloud.

Now that the Foundation Establishment True Person from the Primordial Origin Sect had the upper hand, he naturally wanted to crush them to death.

But who would want to die?

"Xu... Xu Yunfan!"

Zhao Moyang coughed up blood, his voice hoarse, his eyes filled with fear and unwillingness. He stared fixedly at the figure standing firm like a mountain at the center of the thunder.

If he could, he would have committed suicide without hesitation to seek rebirth. However, the thunder was a natural bane to the soul, and within the other's formation, even if his soul were to shed his body, a wisp of his true spirit would likely fail to escape into the Sea of Reincarnation.

He had seen the two causal secret techniques clearly before, especially the Netherlight Erosion of Heaven Talisman, which the other wielded with great familiarity.

There was no escape. The more he ran, the faster he would die.

Moreover, this was the Heavenly Realm, not the Taihua Void Realm where one could escape into the Sea of Reincarnation.

"You can't kill us! We are all disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect, and we are under the command of the Universal Salvation True Lord. If you kill us, the True Lord's divine sense is as vast as the heavens and will surely detect it. By then, you will be purged by the True Lord, and your end will be a hundred times more miserable than ours!"

He roared with all his might, trying to pull out his last lifeline.

Xu Yunfan stood at the core of the thunder formation, purple lightning crackling around him, like a deity commanding the thunder. He looked down upon the three of them on the verge of death, his handsome face showing no ripples, only cold indifference.

A faint, cold arc curled at the corner of his mouth, tinged with an imperceptible hint of mockery.

"Senior Brother, have you forgotten that we are all disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect? Don't you know the nature of our sect?"

As he spoke, his ten fingers danced like butterflies. The two secret techniques within him, the Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppression Fortune Method and the Netherlight Erosion of Heaven Talisman, instantly operated to their extreme.

A faint gray current and fine, dragon-and-snake-like azure thunder patterns flowed over his body's surface, then quietly merged into the void.

In an instant, the already tenuous connection between him and Zhao Moyang's trio, as well as the last vestiges of their aura and karma left on this battlefield, were like dewdrops cast into the blazing sun, rapidly fading and distorting until they were almost imperceptible.

"So-called fellow sect members."

Xu Yunfan's voice was flat and emotionless.

"Senior Brother Zhao, this realm is not the Taihua Void Realm. You were slain here by a True Person-level enemy from the Heavenly Realm, your souls shattered... what does that have to do with me?"

Once dead in this world, there was no thought of reincarnation.

He paused slightly before continuing slowly, "Rest assured, my three seniors... I won't be killing you."

Hearing this, Zhao Moyang, whose mind had been stretched taut like a string, suddenly relaxed, almost collapsing from exhaustion.

To not die, even if severely injured, crippled, or enduring endless humiliation...

It was still better than having his soul shattered.

As long as the green hills remain, there is no fear of running out of firewood.

The thought of luck had not even finished turning in his mind when he saw Xu Yunfan slap his own navel.

*Whoosh!*

A black light shot out, expanding as it met the wind. In an instant, it transformed into a dark banner about three meters tall.

The banner pole was neither gold nor wood; it felt icy cold to the touch, forged from an unknown material, with faint blood patterns hidden within.

The banner surface was black as ink, so profound it seemed to devour all light. Its surface was composed of countless writhing, microscopic dark vortices, exuding a chilling and greedy aura that could freeze one's soul.

Upon closer inspection, against the profound black background, there were innumerable dim yet fierce and cold glimmering points, like a polluted starry cosmos refined within it.

The moment this banner appeared, an invisible, formless, yet incredibly heavy gravitational force that seemed to tear and pull at the soul instantly filled the entire space of the Sky-Locking Formation.

Banner of Ten Thousand Souls.

This banner, originally plundered from someone else and used by Xu Yunfan as a supplementary magic tool, had long since been transformed beyond recognition after being refined with his immense magical power, essence blood, and high level of artifact refinement skill.

It was a treasure he had specifically exchanged for using the contribution points he had accumulated over the years from the Primordial Origin Sect, refined according to the *Slaughter Life Compendium of the Myriad Star Lords*.

At this moment, it was clearly a top-tier demonic treasure.

However, though it was a demonic treasure, its form could be altered.

Looking at the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls that was puffing out black energy, Xu Yunfan gave the pole a slight shake, and the black banner instantly changed. The black energy scattered, transforming into the power of the stars, with infinite starlight shimmering within.

"My three fellow sect members, the Yellow Spring Road is long and lonely. Since you do not wish to die, why not enter my banner for a chat?"

Xu Yunfan held the cold banner pole, a gentle smile on his face, but his eyes as cold as eternal ice. His tone was light, as if inviting an old friend for tea.

If he were to truly let these three go, he wouldn't be able to eat or sleep in peace.

That smile, in the eyes of Zhao Moyang's trio, was even more terrifying than the grin of a fierce ghost from the Nine Hells.

"What?!"

"Banner of Ten Thousand Souls?!!"

Xu Yunfan corrected them, "This is not the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, but the Banner of Myriad Star Spirits I specifically refined. Once you enter, Senior Brother, you will naturally become a Star Lord."

"Spouting nonsense!"

The sliver of luck that had just risen in Zhao Moyang's heart was instantly drowned by boundless terror and anger. His eyes were wide to the point of tearing, his eyeballs almost popping out of their sockets as he roared with the last of his strength.

"Xu Yunfan!!! You wouldn't dare!!!"

The frosty expression on Leng Yuehua's face was completely drained of blood, replaced by ultimate fear.

Being sucked into the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls meant eternal enslavement to the demonic banner, with one's soul being eroded by infinite resentful and vicious energy day and night, unable to be freed, unable to reincarnate, until complete annihilation, or until being fully refined and controlled by a new master.

This was ten thousand times more terrifying than death.

"No!!"

A shrill, distorted scream erupted from her mouth, a sound of utter despair.

They were now like fish on a chopping block. Unless they were truly willing to risk everything to die, to detonate their magical power and destroy their foundation, the consequences were foreseeable.

But as disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect, if they could live, they would not easily choose death.

Sun Qishan was even more furious, struggling to stand up, ignoring the splitting of his wounds all over his body.

"Dog thief! You want to refine me into a vengeful spirit in your banner?! Even as a ghost, I will..."

Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to listen to any more废话.

He gave his wrist a slight shake, and the three-meter-long banner crackled in the wind.

*Hum!*

A low, hollow hum, as if originating from the abyss of the Nine Hells, rippled from the banner surface.

The dense points of light suddenly flared with a ghastly green glow. Endless wails and venomous curses, like tangible sound waves, assaulted the trio's souls.

"Seize!"

Xu Yunfan uttered the true word softly, his hand forming a seal as he pointed at the three of them from afar.

The Banner of Ten Thousand Souls—no, the Banner of Myriad Star Spirits—flared brilliantly with starlight.

The pitch-black banner surface trembled violently, as if a giant, gaping maw of a gluttonous beast had suddenly opened.

An irresistible, immense suction force appeared out of thin air, its target the three people on the ground.

"Ah!"

"No! The Universal Salvation True Lord won't let you off... urgh..."

"Xu... Yun... Fan!"

Desperate curses and wails echoed.

The residual Yin energy around Zhao Moyang was forcibly抽离 and devoured like smoke. His robe was torn by an invisible force.

The essence blood and magical power he had nurtured for hundreds of years, even his flesh, began to disintegrate, transforming into streams of pure black and red energy. These streams, carrying his terrified and twisted soul phantom, wailed as they were sucked into the profound depths of the banner.
