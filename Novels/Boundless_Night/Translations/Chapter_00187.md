# Chapter 187: Bleak Prospects

Kunling City's layout was far from regular; roads were not simply crisscrossing, with slanting and winding paths everywhere. Coupled with its vast area, newcomers easily got lost.

"This..." Wu Yaozu followed a bustling slanting street, then entered a winding path, feeling dizzy as he realized he had returned to where he started. Moreover, the crowds were bustling, shoulder to shoulder. Having just emerged from the Fourth Forbidden Land, he was quite unaccustomed to it and almost got separated from Qin Ming.

"Spiritual goats, just returned from hunting in the mountains, accumulated a century of cultivation! Fresh meat skewers, wonderfully fragrant and full of spiritual essence! Everyone, line up!"

Someone at a BBQ stall was shouting. Indeed, the popularity was unusually high, and the spiritual goat meat looked truly tempting, rich in aroma, and glowing with spiritual light.

"Brother Ming, let's go in and try some," Wu Yaozu said, genuinely feeling hungry.

"It's probably rat demon meat mixed with goat smell, but it's edible," Qin Ming said.

Wu Yaozu: "..."

"Enlightenment Tea, produced from the fringe of the Second Forbidden Land, available once every three years! New product launched! Seniors from the Pure Land personally harvested it. Auction tonight!"

On a sizable teahouse, someone used spiritual light to project their voice, which spread throughout the street, instantly causing quite a stir. Clearly, this teahouse's tea was quite famous.

After entering the city, Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu had already visited two academies and were so disoriented that they couldn't take it anymore. They found an old established restaurant to eat first.

"How exactly is this famous giant city in the Night Mist World planned? Many roads are crooked and winding, so unfriendly to newcomers," Wu Yaozu complained.

At a nearby table, someone laughed and said, "Brother, you can think of Kunling as a cluster of cities. If you view it that way, it's not easy to get lost."

Guided by others, Wu Yaozu and Qin Ming finally gained a deeper understanding of the place. This area was developed by various Daoist Sects and Academies. Each Daoist Sect and Academy would choose a spiritually rich area, expand outwards from their center, with each one forming a district. As this place developed, people continuously migrated in later, filling the blank areas left between different Daoist Sects and Academies. Therefore, Kunling City could be divided into over a dozen districts, covering an extremely vast area. It was not uncommon to find spiritual mountains and giant lakes emitting immortal qi within the city; its area far surpassed other major cities. When different districts connected, the roads were often crooked and slanted.

"Little Wu, you need to change how you address me. From now on, call me Shen Wubing," Qin Ming secretly reminded him. Upon arriving in this new territory, he didn't want to draw attention, mainly because he was after the collections of books in the various academies. By now, his control over his flesh and blood was incredibly precise, allowing him to change his appearance and activate "Harmonizing with the Light, Assimilating with the Dust." At the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, Lu Zizai had helped him refine this secret art, leading to qualitative improvements.

"Understood, Brother Shen," Wu Yaozu nodded.

"The prices here are really not cheap," Qin Ming discovered when paying the bill, realizing it was several times more expensive than Crimson Cloud City. Before he fell into the Fourth Forbidden Land from the sky, his body had been shattered. He used cohesive force to bind some important artifacts, but his clothes and Daylight Gold were completely neglected.

"Alas, I once had a small fortune. All of it exploded with me in the air. Never mind, better safe than sorry," Qin Ming sighed. He counted his Daylight Gold, finding only a hundred-odd coins left. What a pity for the contributions of Wang Nianzhu, Ge Qianxun, and the others.

"Little Wu, spend frugally," he split half with Wu Yaozu, each getting sixty-six coins. This was their entire net worth.

Wu Yaozu nodded and said, "Brother, let's hire a carriage. This place is too winding; we really can't save by walking, we're just taking detours."

Qin Ming nodded, "Alright, let's go. This time, we'll first join an academy and settle down."

Then, they got into a goat carriage. They hadn't eaten spiritual goat meat, but they were riding in a carriage pulled by one. It was taller and sturdier than normal cattle or horses, with gleaming golden fur, quite eye-catching. Initially, the two thought someone was driving the carriage, a human controlling this goat demon to transport passengers. Unexpectedly, it was the old goat itself soliciting business. It was very enthusiastic, articulate, and the nanmu carriage was very clean, carrying a faint fragrance.

"I, Old Goat Jin Xiang, have been a driver for twenty years, honest with young and old, fair prices. If you two young masters need a ride in the future, or want to hire long-term, you can find me," it introduced itself by name.

Wu Yaozu asked, "Old Goat, which academy do you think is good for newcomers like us, who have no background but decent talent?"

Jin Xiang twirled its goatee and said, "Actually, it's hard to compare. Sky Roc Daoist Sanctuary, Mountain River Academy, and others are all good; none are bad, otherwise, they couldn't establish themselves in the Land of Legends. It is said that major figures support all of them!"

"Then let's go to Mountain River Academy," Qin Ming said.

"Alright!" The old goat ran steadily and quickly, and was quite chatty, telling them many things to pay attention to. For example, top-tier candidates had already been admitted in advance. If they wanted to join now, they would have to pass some assessments. "There's a misty area behind Mountain River Academy; don't wander in there, it's easy to get into trouble. Also, there are crouching tigers and hidden dragons in this academy; you need to be low-key when you enter, or you might get picked on..."

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu felt that its service was quite thorough and that riding in its carriage was well worth it. Mountain River District was very prosperous. When viewed independently, it was quite orderly, with temples, residences, and markets arranged in neat rows, bustling with people. The academy was located in the center, occupying a vast area, containing mountains, dense forests, lakes, and large ancient building complexes, mysterious yet vibrant. As soon as they reached the entrance, they saw a large number of students entering and exiting, all very young and full of vigorous life.

Seeing this scene, Jin Xiang was deeply moved and sighed, "Alas, it's another year for new student registrations. Twenty-four years ago, I entered from here. In a blink of an eye, it's been twenty years since I graduated."

Upon hearing this, Wu Yaozu felt completely disheartened. So this was an anomalous senior brother? Did he start driving a carriage right after graduation? This lousy academy's prospects were not good at all, quite worrying!

Jin Xiang quickly added, "Please don't misunderstand, two junior brothers. The cultivation method I, Old Goat, practice is quite special. It requires me to constantly swallow 'mundane qi.' There's no work more suitable for me than this; I'm tempering my heart in the mundane world."

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu exchanged glances. They were already out of the carriage; could they really switch to another academy now? Since they were here, they might as well make the best of it. The two walked forward.

Mountain River Academy used two stone mountains as its gateway, with purple qi flowing around them, and various old, lush trees growing nearby.

"You two junior brothers have extraordinary bearing and are full of vigor; you both look exceptional..." As soon as they reached the entrance, a beautiful young girl greeted them warmly. When she learned that the two were not registering but wished to take a temporary assessment, she immediately smiled faintly, excused herself, and quickly had a young man lead the way.

"Which path will you take: the Immortal Path, the Esoteric Path, the Transformed Path... or the Newcomer Path?" the young man asked.

When he learned that the two were taking the Newcomer Path, the young man smiled and asked, "Do you want to become Golden Armored Guards? Recently, many junior brothers and sisters from the Immortal Path have been selecting helpers."

Wu Yaozu heard this and thought the Newcomer Path was really not great. Brother Ming's prospects were bleak.

"Uh, no such plans recently," Qin Ming said.

Then, the young man waved his hand, summoned a crow, and told it to lead the two to their assessment, while he turned and left.

Wu Yaozu was dumbfounded. After a long moment, he said, "This... this is too realistic, isn't it? From a beautiful senior sister at first to an old crow at the end?!"

"I, Little Crow, am only sixteen, and I'm your senior sister too!" The crow on the tree protested.

"Ah, my apologies, Sister Crow!" Wu Yaozu quickly apologized.

Qin Ming had a twenty-city winning streak, allowing him to join any academy without problems. However, he didn't intend to expose this. He and Wu Yaozu went together for the tests: strength, speed, perception, and practical combat. The two naturally passed smoothly.

Mountain River Academy's interior was profound. The gate area was bustling with new students registering everywhere, but once inside, the place was vast, with forest areas, marsh areas, and more, immediately becoming less noisy.

Sister Crow said, "You two junior brothers are truly lucky this year. The old seniors from the major Daoist Sects and Academies are going to jointly resolve the issue with the Auspicious Beast in the Third Forbidden Land. If you perform well enough, you will definitely be granted Auspicious Beast blood, and most likely undergo Nirvana because of it."

Wu Yaozu immediately rolled up his sleeves, his blood stirring with excitement.

Qin Ming, however, was much calmer. He knew why those Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds appeared: they were there for the Auspicious Beast blood. He estimated the quotas were extremely limited and scarce.

Sister Crow added, "However, your chances are indeed not great. Have you heard of that abnormal eighty-one? His name is Xin Youdao, and he swept through eighty-one cities. He also joined our Mountain River Academy. He's taking both the Esoteric Path and the Newcomer Path simultaneously. Undoubtedly, the people on the Newcomer Path are weaker, with fewer competitors, so he will most likely choose to occupy a spot here to obtain the Auspicious Beast blood."

"This... different paths also have a hierarchy?" Wu Yaozu scratched his head. As a newcomer, he felt it wouldn't be easy for Brother Ming.

Sister Crow said, "Many newcomers realize the reality after half a year or so. And those with clear minds enrolled initially precisely to choose followers. Aren't you two like that?"

Wu Yaozu was speechless.

Soon, Sister Crow took the two to arrange their accommodation. The environment was very ordinary, far from comparable to the spiritually misty, immortal-qi-steaming areas where those on the Immortal Path and Esoteric Path resided. This was a forested area, quite far from the fire springs, appearing rather dim in the night. The only decent thing was that they were independent small wooden cabins, not shared rooms as he had imagined.

Sister Crow smiled, "See that area where fire springs flow, immortal mist steams, and purple qi permeates? Actually, you can fight your way in. Those who perform outstandingly, no matter which path you're on, can live there. There are quite a few beautiful senior sisters there, you know."

"Brother, let's go, let's fight for two rooms. This place, let alone moonlight, even the fire springs are this far away," Wu Yaozu secretly transmitted.

"Let's settle down first and understand the situation here before doing anything," Qin Ming really didn't want to attract attention as soon as he arrived. What he most coveted were the books here; that was his ultimate goal, everything else was secondary. In fact, he planned to visit all the major academies and Daoist Sects.

"Two junior brothers, want tickets?" At the very end, Sister Crow asked mysteriously.

"What's up?" Wu Yaozu was curious.

Sister Crow said, "Xin Youdao is very powerful and has entered our academy. And there's another unparalleled genius who tested his sword across a hundred cities, hailed as a Young Ancestor, also extremely formidable. He has arrived in Kunling City this time and is about to spar with Xin Youdao. Don't you want to watch this battle between the peak figures of our generation?"

"Can't we watch for free?" Qin Ming asked.

"Tsk, what kind of place is Kunling? Major Daoist Sects and academies stand tall, with countless students. Such a representative grand duel among our generation's geniuses, watched by tens of thousands, with many traveling thousands of miles from other cities just to witness it, and you still want to watch for free? Ticket prices have soared to the heavens."

"How much?" Wu Yaozu asked.

It whispered, "I have good seats here. As your senior sister, I'll give you a discount: twenty Daylight Gold per ticket."

"No thanks!" Although Wu Yaozu had just come out of the Forbidden Land and had little experience, he was definitely not stupid. This Sister Crow was clearly asking for a sky-high price, trying to scam them.

"Ticket prices have already been hyped to the clouds, didn't you know? There's nothing cheaper."

The two still shook their heads.

"Brother, when can we fight a match? If we charge like this, we'll get rich quickly!" Wu Yaozu secretly transmitted, thinking that they themselves were also top-tier contestants.

"Tuition fees, accommodation fees..." Sister Crow reminded them kindly. Seeing that they weren't buying tickets, she didn't want to linger either.

The two were dumbfounded. Were they going to go bankrupt as soon as they arrived? The various fees were unbelievably expensive.

"Can we pay in a few days?" Wu Yaozu whispered.

"Yes, someone here is recruiting Golden Armored Guards. Do you want to earn Daylight Gold?"

"We'll consider it first," Qin Ming said.

Sister Crow flapped her wings and flew away, disappearing into the night.

That day, Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu wandered around, just to get familiar with the environment and adapt to the atmosphere here. They noticed many students running towards the main entrance, which quickly caused a commotion. They immediately followed to ask what was happening.

"Come on, let's go to the Flying Immortal Academy next door! Reportedly, an old senior has arrived and will be giving a lecture there, and Immortal Seeds will also share their insights and offer blessings to the new students," someone said.

Qin Ming heard this and immediately lost interest.

"Let me tell you, how powerful these Immortal Seeds are! Some gained enlightenment at three years old, and others once swept through their peers, obtaining near-immortal artifacts..."

As Qin Ming heard such discussions, he immediately stopped the person and asked, "What did you say? Who are these people?"

A moment later, he beckoned to Wu Yaozu, "Little Wu, come on, let's go to Flying Immortal Academy immediately!"
