# Chapter 181: The Hanged Ghost

The tiger demon resembled a small mountain, its body possessing the head of a beast and the form of a human. Its muscles and sinews were twisted and knotted like the gnarled roots of an ancient tree. A rotting tiger tail, still wrapped in half of a bronze chain, hung behind it.

The Corpse Rot Tiger Demon’s spine arched like an inverted moon as it burst from the earth. Shards of broken armor hung from the protruding vertebrae.

As its muscular forepaws tore through the bedrock, dark red rotting flesh fell away in clumps, revealing greenish muscle fibers entwined with bronze chains. The broken end of the chain whipped wildly through the air, scraping sparks against the rock walls like a blade.

"Retreat!"

The Guardian Lamp, his face filled with shock, swallowed hard and roared, raising his Wild Goose Wing Blade horizontally before him. He clearly smelled the foul, bloody stench churning in the tiger demon's throat. In an instant, his head felt slightly heavy—it was the lethal toxic miasma mixed from rotting flesh and beast blood.

The Guardian Lamp hastily pulled a detoxification pill from his pocket and swallowed it. Threads of cool energy seeped into his mind, finally making him feel a bit better.

Only then did he confirm that the demon before them was far beyond their ability to fight.

The sound of metal falling to the ground came from behind; surely, one of the Beimang Mountain men had lost his soul to the creature.

Xu Yunfan was deeply shaken. Although he had learned from the Tiangong Cave’s library and Zhan Yan’s words that the world's spiritual energy was rising and demons would indeed awaken, he hadn't expected one to be so close.

The moment the tiger claw slammed into the ground, Xu Yunfan’s pupils constricted.

The shockwave generated by the three-zhang-tall body cracked the frozen soil into a spiderweb pattern. The blast of air sent three Beimang Mountain disciples who couldn't dodge in time flying.

The beast’s rotting tail swept past, and pine trees as thick as a bowl’s mouth exploded instantly. Flying wooden shards scraped across Xu Yunfan’s cheeks with a sharp *smack*.

A sound like a bellows rolled from the tiger demon's throat, instantly raising a series of thunderclaps across the forest. Many Beimang Mountain disciples were stunned, their eyes swimming with stars, unable to even stand steady. Their internal blood energy churned chaotically, making it impossible to lift their weapons.

Xu Yunfan seemed unaffected. He simply judged from the tiger demon's movements that its strength wasn't too outrageous—at least much weaker than the woman in white from his dream. He might be able to fight it, but the result would likely be mutual destruction, benefiting no one but a third party. Moreover, this was a demon awakening; who knew what kind of spells or divine arts it possessed?

"It is the Guanshan Tiger recorded by the Ancestral Master!" the Guardian Lamp suddenly shrieked, the bronze bell in his hand being crushed out of shape. "It's him! In the third year of the Tianyou era, two thousand years ago, this was the man-eating tiger that killed one hundred thousand laborers! A Great Demon! Run, run quickly! That child is its hanged ghost!"

Before he could finish, a thunderous war cry erupted from the tiger demon's rotting chest, the sound waves causing the mountain rocks to crumble and dust to fall.

Now!

Xu Yunfan, who had already gripped the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, slammed it into the ground. Using the recoil, he slid two zhang across the ground. As the three red ropes soaked in vermilion nitre were severed by the armor-piercing cone at the end of the hammer handle, the bronze cage holding the Ginseng Doll rolled right to his feet.

He hooked the cage with his boot tip and flung it behind him. The entire sequence was as fast as if it had been practiced a thousand times—decisive, sharp, and without a moment's hesitation.

"You dare?!"

The Guardian Lamp’s eyes split wide with rage. They had exhausted their efforts for this Ginseng Doll. Even if this tiger demon had turned the one hundred thousand killed into hanged ghosts, its value was immeasurable. His long blade had barely left his hand when it was swept into a cloud of iron filings by the tiger's tail.

The demon was unusually obsessed with the bronze cage. Its rotting paw smashed two Beimang disciples to pieces, and the foul wind, carrying chunks of flesh, shot straight for Xu Yunfan's back.

Hanged ghost?

Xu Yunfan glanced at the Ginseng Doll in the copper cage. This fair-skinned, red-lipped, white-toothed child was actually a hanged ghost?

Seeing Xu Yunfan looking over, the doll’s little face turned fierce, baring sharp teeth.

Xu Yunfan’s heel slammed against the rock wall, twisting his body into a reverse arch in mid-air. As the tiger claw grazed past his back, he clearly saw a half-broken horse halberd stuck between the claws, its style ancient and covered in rust.

"So it was one who died by weapons," he sneered.

Using the falling momentum, he smashed the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer onto the tiger demon's skull. Infused with blood energy, the hammerhead burst with burning thunderfire, instantly scorching a large patch of the demon's rotting flesh.

The force, wild to the extreme—enough to shatter a hill—brought the tiger demon to a sudden halt.

Seizing the moment as the tiger stumbled in pain, Xu Yunfan executed a hawk's turn, soaring five zhang away.

A manic roar came from behind: "That beast has devoured the flesh of ten thousand! You can't escape! I know how to deal with it! My Beimang Mountain has records! Cooperate with me! The bronze chains on its joints are the Dragon Suppression Nails from back then..."

The voice cut off abruptly, replaced by a rumbling sound nearly loud enough to collapse the mountain.

Xu Yunfan didn't need to look back to know the tiger demon's tail chain had swept the mountain path away.

He held the cage in his left hand and the hammer in his right. The iron spikes on his boot soles scraped sparks against the earth and stone. As he sprinted down, his form brought up a howling wind. The dying screams of the Beimang disciples in his ears were already fading to nothing.

Ahead lay a cliff. Without a moment's hesitation, Xu Yunfan stomped his foot down. The rock beneath shattered with a bang, and he shot off the cliff like an arrow released from a bow.

The tiger demon's pounce, wrapped in foul wind, grazed just over his head.

Mid-fall, he swung the hammer backward. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer turned into a chain hammer, smashing heavily into the tiger demon's lower jaw and flipping the massive body over on the spot.

With a flick of his wrist, he quickly retracted the chain hammer, giving the tiger no chance to recover. The tiger scrambled up quickly, as if the blow had barely affected it. Looking down at Xu Yunfan, who was now the size of a sesame seed, it let out a earth-shattering roar.

The tiger's roar shook the mountain forest.

Visible sound waves rolled from its emaciated throat, snapping the surrounding vegetation. Its eyes filled with bloodlust and rage. After staring fixedly at Xu Yunfan, it straightened its body—its arms nearly touching the ground—and crouching, turned and scrambled away on all fours to the side.

In mid-air, the foul wind kicked up by the tiger's roar numbed the back of Xu Yunfan's neck. But his expression remained unchanged. He twisted his waist and abdomen, the tendons in his forearms tightening like steel wires. Gripping the hammer head, he swung it out in the three-chi-long chain.

The armor-piercing cone at the end of the handle scraped against the rock wall, drawing purple-green sparks. Xu Yunfan gave his wrist a slight shake, sending a wave-like force down the chain to the cone, driving it deep into the sheer cliff.

The moment the chain hammer wedged into the rock fissure, Xu Yunfan's waist and abdomen contracted into a bow shape. The falling momentum was abruptly halted by the sharp sound of the iron chain snapping taut. Thunder-patterned steel chain sparks flew in his palm, but it stabilized his form seven zhang from the cliff top.

Rock fragments splashed like rain.

Xu Yunfan kicked a protruding stone with his boot tip to gain leverage, wrapping the iron chain around his left arm three times like a snake coiling around a neck.

Looking up, he saw the tiger demon's rotting chest hanging over the cliff edge. The bronze chain clattered as it wrapped around the roots of a pine tree on the far side of the cliff. The beast was actually using the old Dragon Suppression Chain to perform a "hanging golden hook" pursuit, coming down after him!

Stones torn loose by the tiger's claws brushed past his face.

Xu Yunfan's right wrist shook urgently, and the chain hammer popped out of the rock fissure.
