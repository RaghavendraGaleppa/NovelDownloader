# Chapter 70: False Pretenses

Lin Shan never expected that the moment he discovered the sect's supreme technique "Seven Nails Book of Curses," Princess Guo would immediately swoop in to snatch it away!

Before he could react, Princess Guo stepped forward from behind him, gracefully tossing ten spirit stones into the hands of the elderly stall owner.

"Ten spirit stones—keep them!"

Her phoenix eyes then met Lin Shan's in a direct stare.

Lin Shan was both shocked and furious. Princess Guo wasn't playing by the rules—she had outright intercepted the purchase, handed over the spirit stones, and forced the transaction without even giving him a chance to counteroffer. He had been fully prepared to engage in a bidding war.

The atmosphere between them grew tense as Lin Shan held the straw effigy firmly in his hand. Hand it over? Impossible. While others might not recognize its value, he knew exactly what it was worth.

Just as he was about to turn and make a higher offer to the old woman, Princess Guo suddenly let out a soft laugh.

"Fellow Daoist Lin, I bought this for you."

Caught off guard, Lin Shan stared at the woman in the blue palace dress in astonishment. 

As if forgetting they were mortal enemies, she arched an eyebrow and asked, "Shall we find a place to talk?"

In a private room of a teahouse within the city, Lin Shan and Princess Guo sat across from each other. 

They sipped tea in silence, occasionally exchanging glances, neither willing to speak first. Lin Shan didn't bother with words of gratitude—he had intended to buy the straw effigy himself, and he certainly didn't need her interference. 

Moreover, Princess Guo was his sworn enemy. Her invitation undoubtedly had ulterior motives. Since fighting was prohibited within the market, he saw no reason to lose the initiative.

After a while, it was Princess Guo who broke the silence. The icy beauty's voice was pleasing to the ear, her crimson lips parting with an alluring charm. Lin Shan almost wondered if she could rival the top courtesans of a brothel.

"Fellow Daoist Lin, originally from Qinghe County in the southern border of the Great Song Dynasty. A collateral descendant of the Lin Clan, you reached the Houtian Qi Exchange Realm at sixteen. Later, you joined the Zangke Nightingale Branch, and two years after that, during the emergence of the Vermilion Fruit in Dongting Lake, you killed Immortal Nan. By the time you arrived in the capital, you were already at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement."

Princess Guo gave him a meaningful glance, recounting his background with unsettling familiarity.

Lin Shan swirled his teacup, his expression unreadable. He showed no surprise, doubt, fear, or anger at having his past laid bare. Since transmigrating to this world, he had lost both parents and had no loved ones to speak of—no vulnerabilities to exploit. 

At most, the Lin Clan of Qinghe County had shown him some kindness in raising him, but that wasn't enough to be used against him. If they were wiped out, it would only fuel his hatred further.

"Princess Guo, as the jewel of Prince Huai'an, your intelligence network is impressive. But surely you don't think this is enough to control me?" Lin Shan said coldly. "Do you plan to use the Lin Clan to threaten me?"

Seeing his composure, Princess Guo inwardly sighed. Despite his youth, this man was shrewd and unshakable—a formidable opponent.

"I know you have no attachments, Fellow Daoist Lin. That wasn't my intention. Besides, you aren't the only one from the Lin Clan to embark on the path of immortality. Why would I make another enemy needlessly?"

Lin Shan recalled hearing that Lin Fan had also been taken away by an immortal cultivator when he last visited the Lin Clan. That did provide an additional layer of security, easing his concerns for the clan.

But Princess Guo's words still held hidden meanings, and her true purpose for bringing him here remained unclear. Lin Shan chose to remain silent.

The icy beauty, seeing his stubbornness, finally dropped the pretense. "Fellow Daoist Lin, let me be frank. I invited you here to propose a truce."

Lin Shan poured himself more tea without looking up. "A truce? Ten spirit stones is a paltry price for reconciliation. Your Highness underestimates me."

Princess Guo frowned. "What do you want? There's no deep-seated enmity between us. I nearly killed you once, and you nearly killed me in return. Let's call it even, shall we?"

Lin Shan sipped his tea, gazing at the distant mountains as if recalling the past. "What about the late Immortal Huang? How do we settle his debt?"

Princess Guo explained patiently, "Immortal Huang's death had nothing to do with me. The green-robed old ghost concealed his identity and leaked your whereabouts—we had no idea. The other two even fought him by the stream. Later, he joined us but sneaked off to claim the spoils alone. His death was his own fault!"

"From start to finish, none of us harmed Immortal Huang directly, did we?"

Lin Shan considered her words. It was true—the green-robed old man had been the one to betray Huang, and Lin Shan had already killed him. Princess Guo and her group had gained nothing from the affair.

But two others came to mind. "What happened to the black-robed nun and the woman with the bamboo hat?"

"The former is dead," Princess Guo replied bluntly. "The latter is the daughter of Duke Qi. Out of respect for her family, we spared her."

Lin Shan fell silent, remembering how the black-robed nun had desperately pleaded for help from him and Huang. 

But he felt no guilt—they hadn't been close, and he had no obligation to risk his life for her. It was merely a passing thought.

The icy beauty grew impatient at his prolonged silence. "Fellow Daoist Lin, we aren't afraid of you. But it's better to resolve enmity than to perpetuate it. Don't think I'm begging you!"

Lin Shan stroked his chin, weighing the pros and cons. 

His priority in Yichuan was to strengthen himself. Revenge could wait—for now, feigning amity would suffice. 

"Very well. But I need you and your allies to do me a favor."

Princess Guo eyed him warily. "What favor?"

"Nothing major," Lin Shan said with a smile. "Your families have connections to royal estates. I'd like you to procure some well-known antiques for me—I have a fondness for collecting. Shouldn't be too difficult, right?"

He was, of course, angling for items imbued with ancient essence.

To his surprise, Princess Guo hesitated. "The kind of highly renowned antiques you're referring to… my father, Prince Huai'an, does have one or two in his collection. I could give them to you, but the others might not be so willing."

"Why not? Aren't they all employed by royal estates?" Lin Shan asked, puzzled.

Princess Guo explained, "Their relationship with the princes is purely transactional. They can't compel the princes to hand over anything. The Great Song Dynasty is backed by the three major sects, and the imperial family itself has Foundation Establishment cultivators. They've warned all immortal practitioners against harming mortal princes."

"So, while mortal princes employ rogue cultivators to deal with mortal experts, no immortal would dare harm them."

She shook her head, indicating she couldn't speak for the others—they were merely hired help.

Lin Shan sighed. Even if he only obtained antiques from Prince Huai'an's estate, it was better than nothing.

After further discussion, they reached an agreement to reconcile. 

If he continued feuding with Princess Guo and her allies, he would eventually have to return to the Great Song Dynasty, where bloodshed would be inevitable. 

Worse, they might ambush him on his way back. While he wasn't afraid of Princess Guo, her companion—the brocade-robed man's talisman sword—was a genuine threat.

With their grievances ostensibly settled, the two gradually relaxed, even sharing lighthearted conversation. Stripped of their enmity, Lin Shan found himself appreciating Princess Guo's beauty—who wouldn't? 

Her ice-attribute spiritual roots gave her an aloof, untouchable aura that stirred a primal desire to conquer.

But then, the icy beauty extended an invitation: a newly discovered rare spirit herb in the northern Yan云 Mountains. Would he join her in retrieving it?

Lin Shan refused without hesitation.

Not a chance!

His mind was wholly occupied with studying the newly acquired "Seven Nails Book of Curses" and breaking through to the peak of mid-stage Qi Refinement. 

Gallivanting with a beauty? Absolutely not. No time!

Princess Guo tried to persuade him, but when she noticed his growing suspicion, she reluctantly gave up.

After some idle chatter, Lin Shan hastily took his leave.

Watching from the teahouse as Lin Shan disappeared into the distance, Princess Guo's charming demeanor vanished, replaced by cold indifference.

"He's gone. You can come out now."

The brocade-robed man and two others emerged from behind the curtains.
