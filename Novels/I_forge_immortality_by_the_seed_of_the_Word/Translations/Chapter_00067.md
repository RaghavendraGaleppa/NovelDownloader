# Chapter 66: How About a Deal?

The spirit crane flapped its wings gently, occasionally letting out cheerful cries. Zhang Jing sat cross-legged on its back, his gaze as calm as still water. The scenery below flashed past his vision until three familiar beech trees came into view.

We're here!

A faint glimmer flashed through Zhang Jing's eyes. Unlike last time, he didn't command the crane to descend but continued flying forward. The moment he left Langya County today, Zhang Jing had keenly sensed hidden eyes following him—like maggots clinging to bones—impossible to shake off no matter how he maneuvered the crane.

The only silver lining was that the pursuer didn't give him a sense of lethal threat, indicating their cultivation was at most at the seventh level of Qi Refinement.

"Who's targeting me?" he wondered. He considered himself an honest man, especially after entering Langya County, where he had kept to himself. It shouldn't have earned him enemies. Could it be those low-grade talisman masters? Or perhaps—

Zhang Jing pondered silently.

Before long, the crane descended slowly, finally landing on a rocky cliff overgrown with dense vegetation by the riverbank.

With a splash!

Encased in protective spiritual light, Zhang Jing plunged into the turbulent black river, his aura instantly merging with the water and vanishing without a trace.

Beneath the river's surface, Zhang Jing moved like a swift fish, darting downstream. Though confident in dealing with his pursuer, he hadn't forgotten the white deer on the verge of a breakthrough in the herb garden. To prevent any mishaps, caution seemed prudent.

Half an hour later, he arrived once more at the narrow crevice barely wide enough for one person. Familiar with the path, he slipped inside. Deliberately suppressing his aura, Zhang Jing moved without a sound, ghostlike.

Gradually, the figure of the demonic deer came into view. It remained in the same state as during his last visit. Zhang Jing exhaled quietly in relief—this was the best possible scenario. Had the creature already broken through, things might have gotten complicated.

With a thought, the roaring sound of water intertwined with the harmonious clashing of magical instruments erupted around him, swelling from faint whispers to a clear melody. Simultaneously, a phantom river emerged from the void, coiling around Zhang Jing. Through its translucent waters, five colliding magical instruments could faintly be seen.

Yet in the next instant, the phantom river vanished. Silence reclaimed the surroundings.

Zhang Jing turned slowly, his expression unreadable as he faced the cave entrance.

**Thud—thud—**

Heavy footsteps approached, drawing near within moments. A figure clad in gray robes soon appeared in sight—a man with strikingly peculiar features: a hooked nose, deep-set hollow eyes, and withered skin that made his age impossible to discern. A faint aura of decay and chill clung to him. His cultivation was likely at the seventh level of Qi Refinement.

"I don't believe we've met," Zhang Jing said tonelessly.

"Tsk," the gray-robed man smirked oddly, feigning amiability. "Young man, the Blood Mill from Heishan County Town is with you, isn't it? You've led me on quite the chase. Be a good lad and hand it over. Do that, and you might just keep your life. Someone as young as you, already at the fifth level of Qi Refinement—such bright prospects ahead. No need to die pointlessly here, don't you agree?"

Opposite him, Zhang Jing's eyes flickered at the mention of the Blood Mill and Heishan County. He recalled the crimson millstone in his storage pouch. So this man was connected to the demonic upheaval in Langya County? No—more likely, he was just a pawn serving those truly behind it.

The crimson millstone was useless to Zhang Jing. But given the circumstances, he knew full well that whether he surrendered it or not, this man wouldn't let him leave alive.

Having assessed the situation, Zhang Jing asked softly, "If I give it to you, you'll spare me?" At the same time, the phantom Five Treasures Spirit River under his control grew turbulent.

"Of course," the man replied, though his gaze kept straying to the spirit herbs nearby, greed etched unmistakably across his face.

"Then I'll hand it over." Zhang Jing took a deep breath, as if preparing to retrieve the Blood Mill. But he was stalling—not out of hesitation, but because he sensed something amiss. The gaze of this man didn't entirely match the one he'd felt tracking him earlier. His intuition warned him: there was another presence here!

"How amusing. All sorts of vermin are crawling out today," Zhang Jing mused coldly.

Time trickled by. The gray-robed man grew impatient. "Boy, stalling won't help. Produce the Blood Mill, and you can leave now."

Just then, an unfamiliar voice rang out confidently: "Junior Brother, how about a deal? Hand over the method to purify demon cores, and I'll ensure your safety."

Zhang Jing turned toward the voice. On an empty patch of ground to his right, the air rippled as a vaguely familiar figure materialized—Gou Sheng, the man from the trading assembly who had coveted his demon core purification technique.

"So the little insect finally reveals itself," the gray-robed man sneered. His words suggested he, too, had been playing along, waiting for Gou Sheng to emerge from hiding.

"You noticed me?" Gou Sheng's eyes widened briefly in shock. He promptly tossed a talisman to the ground, cursing, "This damned high-grade Concealment Talisman was clearly defective. I knew cheap goods were worthless."

His gaze then flickered toward the spirit herbs, excitement flashing in his eyes. This trip was worth it—these herbs could support his cultivation up to the tenth level of Qi Refinement, maybe even help him break into the inner sect. The only obstacle was...

Gou Sheng's killing intent flared as he eyed the gray-robed man. But he held back, turning instead to Zhang Jing. "Well, Junior Brother? What do you say to my offer? Agree, and I'll deal with him immediately. Then you're free to go."

With the purification method from his junior brother and these precious herbs... Was fortune finally smiling on him? Gou Sheng reveled in his fantasy.

But just then, a terrifying surge of spiritual power erupted from the gray-robed man. His face twisted grotesquely as he raised a bone whistle to his lips, veins bulging on his hands. The whistle emitted a hoarse, crow-like screech.

In an instant, a wave of sound imbued with decay and death shot toward Gou Sheng with lightning speed.

The eerie noise snapped Gou Sheng from his reverie. He looked up to see the ashen soundwave bearing down on him, leaving no room to dodge. A suffocating grip of death seized his heart.

No escape. No defense. Failure meant death!

In desperation, Gou Sheng fumbled to activate a magical shield, channeling his late-stage Qi Refinement power into it. The shield blazed with light, positioned squarely before him. Still unsatisfied, he slapped a talisman onto himself, summoning a thick protective barrier.

Yet it was all futile.

The gray-black soundwave passed over him unhurriedly. The shield dimmed instantly; the barrier lasted mere seconds before shattering. Blackened streaks rapidly spread across Gou Sheng's face, reeking of rot.

"If only I hadn't followed today..." he thought regretfully, consciousness slipping away.
