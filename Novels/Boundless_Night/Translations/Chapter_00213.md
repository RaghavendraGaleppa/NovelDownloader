# Chapter 213: Kunling God-like Records

In the tea room, the friend smiled and said, "As expected of an Immortal Seed, good news arrives so quickly. He must be full of youthful vigor and high spirits."

Pu Heng smiled as he unfolded the letter. In an instant, his facial expression froze. Then, with a puff, he spat out the tea in his mouth. The disparity between the information he saw and what he had anticipated was simply too great! What was supposed to be a talent that would astound an era had resulted in his junior disciple's immediate defeat.

"What's wrong?" asked Xu Chengdao, the silver-haired elder sitting opposite him.

"His path is about to be broken; he actually lost to a demon!" Pu Heng's eyes turned icy, and pure Yang consciousness light overflowed from his body. In a flash, many in Kunling City felt a tremor in their hearts. Pu Heng sat there, enveloped by a bloody crimson sun. Pure Yang crimson light pierced through the walls of the tea room, illuminating the entire area as if a blood-red sunset covered the region.

Xu Chengdao guessed that this lineage's old problem had recurred, and Pu Heng wanted to personally intervene. He warned, "External forces cannot interfere with those paths!"

"I'll retrieve the Demon-Slaying Mirror and wait for him to emerge. That plateau is about to be annihilated; in such circumstances, a mere demon seed dares to cause trouble!" Pu Heng said in a deep voice. His junior disciple's defeat was a minor matter, but his master Cao Qianqiu's reputation was of greater concern.

…

Deep in the plateau, a demonic wind swept across the sky, and night mist surged. Unfathomable old demons passed through, heading towards the Secret Realm. Amidst the clouds, colossal dark shadows, like mountains, were faintly visible. Along the way, various strange creatures trembled upon seeing them, instinctively prostrating themselves on the ground. The giant demon's journey shook the night sky!

In the Secret Realm, on the broken path, Li Qingxu was far from having youthful vigor. His chest felt constricted; the opponent's statue stood there, yet he couldn't defeat it. Learning the truth felt like a knife piercing his heart; that demon's talent was higher than his, with the potential to become a new generation of demon god. He had already issued a challenge, awaiting the opponent's arrival at the second plaza!

Qin Ming was unaware of these developments, following his own rhythm. He walked both paths concurrently, reaping double the joy. "Overview of Primordial Heavenly Light…" He found this tattered book in a dilapidated building on the path and read it carefully. Unbeknownst to him, he became engrossed. Although these were ancient texts, everything he saw was an imprint, allowing him to understand and study them. This was no extraordinary technique, let alone a secret tome. However, it deeply absorbed Qin Ming. It described the ancient methods of researching and utilizing heavenly light. One could say that this traceable lineage showed him a certain trajectory: the evolution of Heavenly Light Strength Arts from crude to refined, like the changing tides of history.

"I've gained a lot!" Qin Ming couldn't help but exclaim after finishing. The essence of thousands of years of Heavenly Light Strength Arts, its developmental trajectory, was all contained within the tattered volume.

He "bounced back and forth" between the two paths. On the demon path, he discovered a book called *Kunling God-like Records*, and immediately became interested. Just the first chapter made his expression change slightly. In ancient times, this place was active with god-like beings, even more extraordinary than he had imagined. Of course, calling them all "god-like" wasn't entirely accurate; some were near-immortal beings.

"Kunling, accessible to the Jade Capital, where god-like beings appear and disappear, and near-immortals roam leisurely…"

Qin Ming didn't treat it as a common miscellaneous book. Since he could find it on the path, he naturally read it carefully. It contained stories of gods, immortals, and other beings within the Kunling realm.

"Old cicadas split, new cicadas emerge, flapping wings to flee afar; another god-like being, either perishing or being reborn."

When he read this passage, Qin Ming pondered, feeling that it touched upon certain scriptures, such as the *Golden Cicada Scripture* and the *Divine Cicada Scripture* above it. Could it be that the origins of certain extraordinary techniques and higher-level secret tomes could be traced back to some god-like beings?

"What happened in Kunling back then? A divine cicada once struggled to escape afar. It truly makes one wish to go back to that era and see for themselves."

Qin Ming read with great interest, learning about some ancient god-like beings. In fact, the "Six Rulers" he had mentioned when he previously fooled Cui Chongxuan didn't seem so unreliable anymore. This book vaguely mentioned "one Ruler," who was a dead old god.

"God-like beings have finite lifespans, and near-immortals also have their limits; they seek techniques to modify destiny and transformations to extend their lives…" Qin Ming closed the book and walked away, back on his journey. He began to ponder the true origins of certain cultivation methods. Qin Ming felt that these miscellaneous books broadened his horizons, allowing him to consider his future path from a higher perspective.

Subsequently, on the demon path, he encountered a blood-colored trial: a battle on the same level, unfolding in a huge palace. Demons continuously appeared. These were all first-realm strange creatures, and all were very strong. Initially, the number of demons was limited, but then it continuously increased, from one-on-one, to one-against-many, and finally to him fighting his way through a horde of demons, drenched in blood. For a time, Qin Ming fought until his eyes almost turned into blades. He had pushed his Dragon Serpent Strength to its peak, tearing through and carving open the horde of demons with overwhelming force. In the end, no more demons appeared in this area; he had utterly annihilated them all.

After a brief silence, the Heavenly Demon Mirror gave a cold evaluation: "Within the first realm, one can be called supreme for an era!"

Qin Ming asked, "Does that refer to this era?"

The Heavenly Demon Mirror replied, "During the era when demons were just emerging, when their methods were still crude." Then, it surprisingly added a few more cold words, stating that with his talent, it would truly be Heaven's envy if he couldn't successfully restore the complete demon seed. Was it showing appreciation for his talent? Qin Ming confirmed that it was indeed a damaged artifact, rather sluggish and mechanical, allowing him to muddle through.

Finally, he heard a notification: he was about to step into the second node, where someone would challenge him on the same level, and it would be a real battle. Qin Ming knew who was waiting for him and felt no fear. According to the rules here, there was no need to retreat.

The sky of the Secret Realm trembled violently. Everyone was startled and looked up, then saw two paths, like divine rainbows, stretching across the sky. Moreover, the two paths actually intersected, blocking each other.

"It's still the Demon Seed and the Immortal Seed; are they going to battle again? But that Immortal Path is already incomplete, almost broken, there's no chance at all."

The Secret Realm erupted in an uproar, many people gazing skyward.

"Is Li Qingxu unwilling to accept defeat? Does he want a final battle? But I don't favor him; thinking about it, he always loses in crucial battles." Soon, people recalled that he had been severely wounded by Li Qingyue during the struggle for a near-immortal item, ultimately suffering a crushing defeat. "Today, if he is eliminated from the 'Path Contest,' his title of Immortal Seed will be somewhat undeserved!"

In the sky, on one demon path, red mist billowed and purple qi swirled, a truly grand sight. It stretched forward, bearing a strong, imposing figure. On the other path, broken and dim, swaying precariously, even the immortal mist had thinned. A young man, dressed in feather robes and holding a bamboo staff, walked forward. The two paths intersected, bringing them simultaneously to a node, standing on a plaza.

In the Secret Realm, many people frantically rushed towards some large mountains. The two paths were not horizontally suspended high in the sky; their altitude was limited. If they ascended the peaks, they might be able to vaguely observe the battle.

A demon spoke, "What dragon-tiger struggle? Those people are thinking too much. Our demon race's heaven-defying talent will naturally sweep away that Immortal Seed. After all, that person has already been defeated by him."

Although many disciples from the Outer Realm disliked Cao Qianqiu's lineage, they didn't wish for Li Qingxu to suffer a terrible defeat, as it concerned the face of the immortal path. In truth, many people knew that the Immortal Seed was unlikely to turn the tables.

"This time, a major 'accident' is probably going to happen. Li Qingxu might be knocked off the immortal path."
"If Elder Cao Qianqiu knew, would he fly into a rage?"
"Are you trying to die? Don't talk about that!"
A small group of disciples who were dissatisfied with Li Qingxu discussed in private.

In mid-air, the plaza shimmered with a hazy light mist, then it actually simulated a mountainous terrain to welcome the two, preparing for a grand battle.

Qin Ming stepped forward, his thick black hair unbound, looking unruly and wild, his eyes full of aggression. By any measure, he looked like a transformed demon, brimming with wildness. He looked at the familiar face opposite him, a slight curve on his lips. He was truly impatient, for he had waited for this moment for a long time. Putting aside past grievances, solely from the immediate benefits, it was worth his effort, as it concerned the completion of the fragmented demon seed, his continuous rebirth, and the cultivation of other extraordinary techniques.

Li Qingxu looked at his opponent, his heart sinking. Although he detested this demon, he could feel the other's strong confidence. Yet, he had no choice. The path could no longer be pushed, so he had to fight himself.

Li Qingxu launched a swift attack first. A portion of his consciousness light, already possessing pure Yang attributes, transformed into a dazzling sword and slashed forward, accompanied by the sound of wind and thunder, creating a massive disturbance! He himself also moved with instant shift, swinging his purple bamboo staff to strike his opponent.

Qin Ming was equally fast, like lightning, and met the attack bare-handed. His right fist, like a blazing sun hanging in the sky, exploded with a *boom*, shattering the pure Yang sword. His left hand, like a blade, chopped down on the shimmering purple bamboo staff, creating layers of rune ripples that numbed Li Qingxu's arm, almost making him lose his grip on the staff. This shocked him; he had just begun to clash, and he was already at a disadvantage? The opponent's fist, dazzling like a blazing sun, scorched his consciousness light, causing waves of pain.

In an instant, Li Qingxu was covered in runes from head to toe, from flesh to consciousness light, as if densely inscribed with scriptures. This was the sect-guarding art he had comprehended on the Immortal Path with the help of that special incense and cushion.

Boom!

Qin Ming's fist seemed to be burning, and it appeared to be coiling with a dazzling great dragon. It was supremely firm and fierce, unleashed with full force—this was the strongest Dragon Strength from the Dragon Serpent Scripture erupting. Simultaneously, his left palm seemed to be coiling with a great serpent, wrapped in tendrils of black mist, with dark light surging—this was the more Yin-aligned Serpent Strength of the Dragon Serpent Scripture. Now, Yin and Yang, two types of strength, burst forth from his body, forming a black-and-white dragon-serpent diagram in front of him, possessing a destructive momentum.

In the Secret Realm, many people were horrified, for they actually heard waves of dragon roars! Li Qingxu's runes, like armor, clanged, but they were continuously eroded by the black-and-white dragon-serpent diagram, obliterating many of their textures. With a *bang*, in their first full-force confrontation, Li Qingxu was sent flying backward. His face grim, he landed on the ground, staggering back several steps, staring ahead. What kind of monster was that? He found it somewhat unbelievable.

Many people clearly heard a *crack* as a part of the Immortal Path in the sky crumbled. At this moment, the Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds on other paths were startled, all looking towards this direction. Li Qingyue narrowed her eyes, watching the battlefield at that node. Cui Chonghe, Su Shiyun, Zhao Yaoting, Leng Feiyue, and others all looked up, observing this battle.

Li Qingxu snorted. From deep within his flesh, nine dazzling divine chains burst forth, coiling around his body and extending to his consciousness light, emitting a dangerous aura. Qin Ming sneered, his black hair unbound. Outside his body, Yin-Yang qi surged, and the black-and-white dragon-serpent diagram expanded, enveloping him, spinning at high speed. And in his left and right hands, black and white light surged, transforming separately into a Serpent Sword and a Dragon Saber, their clanging sounds awe-inspiring.
