# Chapter 83: The Senior Sister's Backing

Gu Mo quickly received Chu Feifei's message talisman. After understanding the situation, he grew concerned—could Chu Feifei's secret have been discovered? Otherwise, why would an inner disciple with potential to become a true disciple persist in inviting her after being rejected once? 

Being turned down twice was akin to slapping an inner disciple in the face. If the person was narrow-minded, retaliation was almost certain. An inner disciple had countless ways to exact revenge on an outer disciple, all while skirting the sect's rules. 

Thus, Chu Feifei's request for information about the inner disciple was absolutely necessary. However, obtaining such intelligence wasn't just difficult for outer disciples—even inner disciples would find it challenging. 

But Gu Mo had connections. Without hesitation, he took out his communication jade slip and sent a message to Yuan Niya. 

Before long, the slip shimmered. Activating it, Yuan Niya's voice came through:  
"Junior Brother Gu Mo, did you offend that Ye Yuqi?"  

"It's for a friend..." Gu Mo explained the situation, careful not to withhold details since he was asking for her help.  

"Your friend is a girl?" Yuan Niya suddenly interjected.  

"She's someone I met in the outer disciple quarters." Though puzzled by the question, Gu Mo answered truthfully.  

"Oh!"  

Hearing that the friend was merely an outer disciple, Yuan Niya's tone lightened considerably. As long as it wasn't another senior sister from the inner sect, she didn't mind. Outer disciples posed no threat—her real concern was other inner sect sisters trying to cozy up to Gu Mo.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, tell your friend to be careful. Ye Yuqi is strong—he ranks among the top five inner disciples. He’s also quite handsome, with many female disciples fawning over him. There are rumors linking him to several disappearances of female disciples."  

"Though nothing was ever proven, so the cases were dropped. Personally, I don’t think he’s a good person." Yuan Niya shared all she knew.  

"Senior Sister Yuan, how do you know these details?"  

The earlier information was ordinary, but the part about disappearances seemed classified. How did she access such sensitive details?  

"Hmph, my master is an elder of the Sect's Disciplinary Hall. What do you think?" Yuan Niya's smug tone carried through the talisman.  

Gu Mo hadn’t known that. The Disciplinary Hall was a feared department within the sect, and its elders needed formidable strength to enforce discipline. They also maintained confidential records on disciples.  

Eager to secure a true disciple position, Yuan Niya had secretly reviewed the files of other inner disciples, uncovering many hidden truths. The disappearances she mentioned were among them—never publicly disclosed due to lack of evidence. Ye Yuqi, as an elite inner disciple, enjoyed the sect's protection unless irrefutable proof emerged.  

Accessing such files was strictly forbidden, especially for inner disciples. Yuan Niya had taken a huge risk—if her master found out, punishment would be inevitable.  

"Thank you, Senior Sister Yuan."  

After learning the inner disciple's background, Gu Mo ended the communication and relayed the information to Chu Feifei.  

Upon receiving the message, Chu Feifei felt immense pressure. She couldn’t fathom how she’d inadvertently provoked a top-five inner disciple.  

Her options were limited. Reporting Ye Yuqi to the sect for harassment would be futile—he had merely extended an invitation, with no overt threats. The sect wouldn’t question an elite inner disciple based on an outer disciple’s word.  

Worse, Chu Feifei might be accused of slandering an inner disciple. All she could do was wait and observe.  

Just then, Gu Mo’s second message arrived, advising her to stay vigilant and seek his help if anything seemed amiss.  

Chu Feifei exhaled, comforted by Gu Mo’s reassurance. For an outer disciple to offer aid against an inner disciple showed remarkable courage.  

Still, she wouldn’t drag Gu Mo into trouble unless absolutely necessary—he, too, was vulnerable to an inner disciple’s retaliation.  

As this thought crossed her mind, another message from Gu Mo arrived. He praised her for confiding in him and reiterated his willingness to help, even against an inner disciple.  

Gu Mo sent this as insurance—his biggest fear was Chu Feifei suffering in silence until it was too late.  

As his only trusted friend on the cultivation path, he couldn’t bear to see her harmed. Beyond friendship, Chu Feifei had aided him greatly—her knowledge of formations and the unique fragrance that accelerated his cultivation.  

In a dire situation, Gu Mo would cash in the favor Yuan Niya owed him for his mastery of the Purification Art. Initially, he’d worried Yuan Niya might be outmatched by Ye Yuqi, but knowing her master was a Disciplinary Hall elder eased his concerns.  

The only weak link now was Chu Feifei herself—if she alerted him in time, he could protect her.  

"The boasts keep getting bigger."  

Chu Feifei smirked at Gu Mo’s message. Though skeptical of his ability to confront an inner disciple, having a caring friend on this arduous path warmed her heart.
