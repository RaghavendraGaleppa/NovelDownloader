# Chapter 3: A Washbasin-Sized Snapping Turtle

"Whoa, a crucian carp this big?"

Chu Jiang reeled in his rod again, and a crucian carp larger than his palm leaped out of the water.

"Hey, mine too!" Chu Yingcai exclaimed excitedly, having hooked a fish himself.

Chu Jiang carefully placed the crucian carp down and looked at Chu Yingcai. A carp of about two jin! As expected of the novice's lucky period, his very first catch was a two-jin carp.

Chu Jun was a bit frustrated; he hadn't caught anything yet.

"Bro, you're no good," Chu Yingcai mocked without reservation.

"Hmph, I'll catch one bigger than both of yours later," Chu Jun retorted with a huff.

Chu Jiang smiled and continued fishing.

Not long after, another fish took the bait – a small minnow. Chu Jun finally caught a fish, a thumb-sized minnow, which depressed him considerably. Chu Jiang kept catching fish, but they were all small minnows. Chu Yingcai also caught a few minnows, slowly waiting.

They continued fishing until noon, eating flatbreads and drinking some water. Chu Jiang wondered inwardly, *Could today's minor auspicious sign just be these minnows? He'd caught over a dozen minnows all morning. Enough to make a plate?*

Besides the two-jin carp, Chu Yingcai had caught another palm-sized crucian carp, but nothing else. Chu Jun only had a few minnows.

After finishing their flatbreads, they resumed fishing. The fishing rod twitched frequently; all were minnows. A nearby fisherman glanced at him and said, "Brother Jiang, these minnows are swarming your spot. You should move."

"Brother Jiang, I want to move," Chu Jun said glumly, as he too was only catching minnows.

"Hey, a fish!" Chu Yingcai cried out in surprise; a larger carp, about three jin, had surfaced.

"For your first time fishing, the heavens are really favoring you," an envious fisherman remarked.

Chu Jun's face broke into a smile: "As expected of my brother, he's benefiting from my luck."

"Ha," Chu Yingcai pouted, swiftly placing the carp into his fish basket.

Chu Jiang caught another minnow: "No need to move now, the day's almost over anyway." It was getting late, and moving wouldn't allow for much more fishing. *But the divination indicated a minor auspicious sign in the North. Could it be Chu Yingcai's spot? He could only tell that the minor auspicious sign was in the North and related to water, but exactly where or what kind of good fortune it was, he didn't know. If this minor auspicious sign referred to the entire Changmin River, then it wouldn't matter much where they sat.*

Another fish, still a minnow. Chu Jiang had gotten used to it.

Time passed, until evening. Chu Jiang's fish basket now contained dozens of minnows. Chu Jun's basket also had minnows, though fewer than Chu Jiang's.

"It's here!" Chu Jun's eyes lit up, and his hand felt a heavy pull: "This must be a big one this time."

"Mine too!" Chu Yingcai exclaimed excitedly.

"You kid, you're catching all the big fish today," the nearby fishermen said glumly. Although they had caught some fish, they were all around one jin, no match for Chu Yingcai's two or three jin carp.

*Splash!*

The water surface rippled. Chu Jun lifted his rod, and a patterned fish surfaced: "Is this a patterned fish? Good heavens, it must weigh four or five jin!" The nearby fishermen exclaimed in excitement.

Chu Jiang was also stunned. A patterned fish, known as a blackfish in his previous life.

"I've caught a big one too!" Chu Yingcai shouted excitedly; his fishing rod also had a catch.

Chu Jiang was about to look when his own rod suddenly plunged. He quickly yanked it up, but it felt incredibly heavy, and he couldn't pull it out of the water immediately. *A big fish! The minor auspicious sign in the North had finally arrived!*

Chu Jiang pulled harder again, but the thing beneath pulled with even greater force, nearly dragging his rod away. He could only ease up and begin playing the fish. To his surprise, the fish had immense strength. For a moment, he had to cling to a tree trunk with one hand to keep from being pulled into the water.

*Splish-splash!*

Waves churned on the surface, and strange cries emanated from beneath the water. Chu Jiang stumbled, nearly falling into the water. Fortunately, he held onto the tree trunk tightly and wasn't dragged in.

On the other side, Chu Jun had already reeled in his fish and put it in the basket. Seeing Chu Jiang's predicament, he quickly came to help. Working together, they finally stabilized the rod and stalemated with whatever was at the bottom of the water.

"How big is this fish? We can't even pull it up with two of us?" Chu Jun exclaimed in surprise.

Chu Jiang's expression was grave. His fishing rod was taut, bent like a bow. Chu Yingcai had also reeled in his catch – a five-jin carp.

With all three helping, it became a bit easier, and the thing in the water slowly surfaced.

A snapping turtle!

The size of a washbasin!

"What a huge snapping turtle!" the three exclaimed in shock.

*Crack!*

The fishing rod creaked under the strain. The three immediately started dragging the rod, pulling back little by little. If they tried to lift it any more, the rod would definitely break. The snapping turtle thrashed in the water, sending up huge splashes. The surrounding fishermen also came to help, some bringing fishing nets to assist in scooping up the turtle.

"This turtle must weigh twenty or thirty jin!" the middle-aged man with the scoop net said in surprise.

"A snapping turtle this big is older than all of us! It's a great tonic!" The surrounding fishermen also gathered around.

It took everyone working together to drag the snapping turtle ashore. Its claws were surprisingly sharp, already tearing the fishing net.

"Third Uncle, I'll pay you back for the fishing net when we get back," Chu Jiang said.

"Hey, I made it myself. What's there to pay back? I have more at home," the middle-aged man laughed. His name was Chu Shanhe, the third oldest in his family. They knew him from fishing, and everyone called him Third Brother or Third Uncle.

"This snapping turtle is quite fierce, and its claws are sharp. Be careful when you butcher it." Chu Shanhe said, "You could sell it, it should fetch a good price."

"I'll take it back and see first," Chu Jiang said with a grin. "Thanks, everyone!"

"What are you being polite for? You've helped us scoop up fish plenty of times," everyone chuckled.

Chu Jiang then looked at his fishing rod, which now had many cracks. "I won't be able to fish tomorrow. I'll have to go into the mountains to find a good bamboo stick." He took off his clothes, wrapped the snapping turtle in them, and then tucked it into his fish basket. If he didn't secure it, the minnows inside would be ruined by it.

Returning with their abundant catch, Chu Jun and his brother sold their larger fish when they passed through town, taking the smaller ones home to eat. Chu Jiang thought for a moment and decided not to sell the snapping turtle. He planned to make a pot of Polygonum Multiflorum stewed snapping turtle and bought many seasonings.

Back home, he went next door.

"Uncle Lin, are you home?" Chu Jiang called out.

"I'm home." A man with partially gray hair walked out, smiling. "Little Jiang'er, did you catch some fish?"

"Hey, I caught a huge snapping turtle! I'm planning to stew it, and I wanted to invite Uncle Lin for a drink." Chu Jiang smiled, taking out a money pouch: "I still owe you fifteen wen. Please take it."

"You child, what's the rush?" A sallow-faced woman walked out, saying displeasedly, "Aren't you saving money? The turtle you caught, you should sell it! It's such a waste to eat it."

"Auntie, I can earn money slowly later. This kind of snapping turtle is hard to come by, it's the size of a washbasin. It would be a pity to sell it," Chu Jiang said with a smile. "Please keep this money. I'm the kind of person who gets uneasy if I owe someone something and don't pay it back. It's always on my mind." *Money could be saved slowly, but a snapping turtle this big was a rare find. Thinking of his previous life, toiling desperately for money, when had he ever tasted such freshness? Moreover, with the Purple Star Qi Divination, he would surely find more good things in the future. Uncle Lin's family had been kind to him. Now that he had something good, he had to treat them to a meal as a thank you.*

"Good child," Auntie Lin murmured with emotion.

"Brother Jiang." A clear voice rang out. A young girl walked out from inside the house, standing gracefully before him: "You caught something good, and you call my father, but not me?"

"Haha, let's all go, let's all go," Chu Jiang laughed. "Why aren't you at the cloth shop?" The girl before him was Uncle Lin's daughter, Lin Jingxian, fourteen years old this year, working as a textile weaver at the Lin Family Cloth Shop in town.

"It's already the end of the month, I come home one day each month," Lin Jingxian said.

"Right, right, it's the end of the month, look at my memory." Chu Jiang realized it was indeed the end of the month and immediately said, "Then let's go, come to my house together. I've prepared some good dishes this time."
