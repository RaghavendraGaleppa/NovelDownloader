# Chapter 87: The Crossing Truth Star Formation!

"How could we trouble Junior Sister like this?"  

"Since we've come, we're not afraid of competition. Just set the rules, Junior Sister—whether it's a contest of skill or wealth, we won't object!"  

The tall, burly disciple who had spoken earlier thumped his chest and answered loudly.  

But his words made many in the hall frown.  

A contest of wealth? Not everyone had family backing. Once they cultivated spells and advanced in realm, few had spare spirit stones left—how could they compete in wealth?  

"The Bian family is under the protection of a High Elder and possesses a third-tier spirit island—what need do they have for our spirit stones? Today's Mystic Grass Banquet is merely the High Elder's grace, forming good karma with us. Speaking of wealth is too vulgar. In my opinion, a contest of skill is better!"  

"Exactly! Treasures belong to the virtuous—let it be a contest of skill!"  

As soon as these words were spoken, the hall erupted in agreement.  

Most of those present today were confident and bold, intending to win the mystic grass through sheer ability, with no intention of spending their own resources.  

"Not acceptable!"  

"The Bian family's status is lofty—they don't lack spirit stones, but how can we shamelessly take the mystic grass without offering anything? A contest of wealth it is!"  

Yet among the aristocratic families, many wished to obtain the mystic grass through wealth. For a time, the hall grew noisy with debate.  

The tall young man from earlier suddenly raised his voice, casting a meaningful glance at Bian Chuyao before speaking earnestly:  

"Junior brothers, please quiet down!"  

"In my view, why not compromise? Let us first compete in skill, and the victor can then purchase the mystic grass from Junior Sister Bian at market price. How about that?"  

The moment he spoke, the jade hall fell silent.  

Then, objections erupted like boiling water.  

"Who's your junior brother? Shan Yunlong, don't presume to speak for us!"  

"Exactly! With Junior Sister Bian's family background, what need does she have for spirit stones?!"  

"If it's wealth, then just wealth—why add skill into it?"  

"If we've already bested all challengers and proven ourselves peerless in our realm, aren't we worthy of a single stalk of mystic grass?"  

"Even in the Dao Academy's treasure hunts, there's no rule of winning a contest and then paying!"  

"Junior Brother Shan, sit down and stop talking. Your Shan family has only produced two generations of Foundation Establishment cultivators—how dare you covet Junior Sister Bian?"  

The hall buzzed with objections, openly and covertly berating the tall young man.  

Bah! You want to curry favor with Junior Sister Bian at our expense?  

Today, it's either free or nothing!  

We'll give either face or substance—not both!  

Did you really think we'd offer both effort and money?  

The cultivators in the hall were all elite Qi Refinement disciples of Green Peak Dao Academy, sharp-minded and clear-headed. They wouldn't let the tall young man have his way. The tide of voices and surging auras made his face flush red, forcing him to sit back down.  

---  

"Senior brothers, please calm your anger."  

"My ancestor has long made it clear—the Golden-Cutting Mystic Grass is meant to foster good karma and strengthen our Dao Academy! How could we ask you to compete in skill and spend your wealth?"  

Seeing the tall young man retreat with a red face, Bian Chuyao smiled gently and raised her voice slightly.  

Once she spoke, the crowd quieted, no longer arguing.  

"We'll all listen to Junior Sister Bian. Whatever method you propose, we won't object!"  

A cultivator in the hall spoke up, and the others nodded in agreement.  

"In that case, I’ll take the liberty to make a suggestion."  

Seeing no objections, Bian Chuyao spoke softly:  

"All senior brothers here are outstanding talents of the academy, formidable in strength. If we compete one-on-one, not only is there risk of injury, but it would also be time-consuming. With over twenty participants, the rounds would drag on endlessly."  

"Coincidentally, this Golden Cauldron Hall was bestowed by my ancestor and contains a formation called the 'Crossing Truth Star Formation,' designed to test cultivators. The senior brother who progresses the farthest within the formation will win the mystic grass!"  

"If anyone can break through the formation entirely, I’ll present an additional reward!"  

"What do you think, senior brothers?"  

Bian Chuyao smiled warmly, her gaze sweeping across the hall.  

"An excellent proposal, Junior Sister! Let’s proceed with this!"  

The tall young man who had sat down earlier was the first to stand and agree.  

After exchanging glances, the others nodded as well.  

"We’ve long heard of the 'Crossing Truth Star Formation'—a masterpiece of Elder Bian, used to select outstanding talents. How could we shy away from such an opportunity? We’ll follow Junior Sister’s suggestion!"  

"Indeed! We’re here seeking the mystic grass—how can we be picky? Into the formation we go!"  

"One-on-one duels would take too long, and skipping rounds might leave some dissatisfied. Breaking through the formation is a clever solution—everyone can participate!"  

Voices of agreement filled the hall, and the method for competing for the mystic grass was settled.  

Gu Yuan did not object.  

Bian Chuyao had long prepared this plan—her earlier words were merely formalities.  

Everyone was here to seek the grass—who would dare oppose the Bian family’s might?  

"Since that’s settled, I’ll summon the formation. Please remain seated, senior brothers!"  

Bian Chuyao bowed slightly to the crowd, then her expression turned solemn as she produced a golden seal.  

The seal shimmered with dazzling golden light, and the sight of it silenced the hall.  

This was the seal of a Golden Core Elder, infused with a trace of golden essence.  

"Clang!"  

As the seal activated, the jade hall trembled slightly, as though a river of stars had descended, replacing the structure. Within the starry expanse, countless brilliant astral patterns shimmered, cascading from above to form silver and dark steps.  

---  

Forty-nine steps in total stretched vertically at the center of the hall.  

The mystical sight left the onlookers transfixed.  

Once again, the profundity of the Golden Core realm was revealed.  

"The formation is ready. Senior brothers, please demonstrate your prowess!"  

Bian Chuyao’s voice rang out, snapping everyone to attention.  

"I’ll go first!"  

The tall young man was once again the first to respond.  

This time, no one objected—all eyes were fixed on him.  

"Senior Brother Shan, be careful!"  

Bian Chuyao offered him a gentle smile and a soft word of caution.  

"Thank you for your concern, Junior Sister. I won’t disappoint you!"  

Heartened by her words, the tall young man grinned, bowed to her, then straightened and strode onto the steps.  

"Thud!"  

With his first step, his body sank slightly.  

His expression was solemn but not grave.  

"Thud! Thud! Thud!"  

After taking a deep breath, he ascended six steps in quick succession.  

The lack of obstacles put him at ease, and he continued upward to the eighth step.  

"Boom!"  

The moment his foot touched the eighth step, his face paled, and he froze in place. Only after several breaths did he recover and press onward.  

The crowd watched intently.  

Though they scorned the tall young man for his ambitions toward Bian Chuyao, none could deny his talent and strength—he was a formidable opponent in any contest.  

So they observed closely.  

Though his progress was halting, with several pauses, he eventually reached the thirtieth step.  

But on the thirty-first, his body lurched, and he plummeted from the steps.  

Before anyone could react, he was already back on his cushion—pale-faced and drenched in sweat.
