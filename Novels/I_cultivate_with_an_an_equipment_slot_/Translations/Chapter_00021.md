# Chapter 21: The Hidden Mask

Zhang Yan took out a cracked alchemy furnace from his storage pouch.

This was the Wood Origin Alchemy Furnace he had purchased earlier at the market.

**[Name]**: Wood Origin Alchemy Furnace  
**[Quality]**: Green  
**[Equipment Effects]**: Alchemy Experience +30%, Minor Mastery in Alchemy, Major Mastery in Fire Control  

Although he had never actually used this furnace to refine pills, he often equipped it in his gear slot to continuously study alchemy techniques.

What frustrated Zhang Yan the most was the "Minor Mastery in Alchemy" effect. He initially thought it applied to all types of pills, but upon closer examination, he realized it only granted proficiency in refining a specific pill called the **Qi Gathering Pill**.

Upon reflection, this made sense. After all, the Wood Origin Alchemy Furnace wasn't a high-quality furnace—just a mid-tier first-grade one. Most users of such furnaces would only know how to refine one type of pill.

Moreover, as he traced the cracks on its surface, Zhang Yan strongly suspected they were caused by an alchemy mishap—likely an explosion during pill refining.  

After all, alchemy furnaces weren't meant for combat, so the cracks couldn't have come from anything else.  

"Fortunately, it still retains the Minor Mastery effect. Even if it's just for one type of pill, it's enough for me."  

The **Qi Gathering Pill** was commonly used by early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators. Consuming one could replace several days of arduous cultivation. However, they were expensive—costing **10 spirit stones per pill**, making them unaffordable for most ordinary cultivators.  

"This shortage is because the Green Summit Sect lacks enough alchemists," Zhang Yan sighed. The sect had very few alchemists—so few that among its five main peaks, none were dedicated to alchemy. They only occupied one of the twelve subsidiary mountains.  

As a result, pill circulation within the Green Summit Sect was limited. While the situation was better than for rogue cultivators, it paled in comparison to sects with large numbers of alchemists.  

For example, the pills given to him by Elder Bai included a bottle of Qi Gathering Pills, along with some cheap pills like Fasting Pills and Antidote Pills.  

This was also why Zhang Yan had never used pills to aid his cultivation—they were simply too expensive!  

But now that he had some spare spirit stones, he decided to buy materials and attempt refining pills himself.  

In Zhang Yan's mind, his priorities were clear:  

**High-quality gear with special effects > Pills > Farming.**  

High-quality equipment with unique effects was the most important. That was why he hadn't hesitated when he saw the Wood Origin Alchemy Furnace.  

The reason was simple:  

**Alchemy was a top-tier skill.**  

He had no idea when he'd encounter another affordable piece of equipment with alchemy-related effects, so he couldn't afford to pass up any opportunity.  

After harvesting all his spirit rice and selling it for spirit stones—keeping some for himself and handing over a portion to the sect—Zhang Yan returned to the market.  

This was his second visit.  

The market was just as lively as before, filled with Green Summit Sect disciples, so the atmosphere was relaxed.  

In contrast, markets outside the sect were said to be dangerous—where a single misstep could lead to robbery or murder.  

But within the Green Summit Sect's market, such risks didn't exist. No one would dare commit crimes under the watchful eyes of the Golden Core Ancestor.  

After browsing for a while, Zhang Yan sighed.  

There weren't any particularly appealing pieces of equipment in the market.  

This wasn't because the market lacked good items—there were plenty of high-quality artifacts.  

However, most of them were brand-new, with only their inherent effects.  

For Zhang Yan, these weren't cost-effective.  

What he wanted were artifacts with **unique additional effects**.  

After some more wandering, he resolved that if he couldn't find gear with special effects, he'd rather not buy anything at all.  

Every spirit stone he had was hard-earned!  

"Hmm?"  

As he passed a stall, Zhang Yan suddenly paused, his gaze drawn to a broken mask lying in a corner.  

**[Equipment Name]**: Hidden Mask  
**[Equipment Quality]**: Blue  
**[Equipment Effects]**:  
- **Spiritual Sense Resistance** (Blocks spiritual sense detection)  
- **Concealment Art (Perfected)** (Hides the user's aura)  

"This mask is excellent!"  

Zhang Yan's eyes widened in surprise.  

He hadn't expected the mask to have a **Perfected-level skill**—a rare find.  

Additionally, the Spiritual Sense Resistance effect would be incredibly useful.  

Approaching the stall, he crouched down and asked the vendor, "Senior Brother, how much for this mask?"  

The vendor was a middle-aged man with a sallow complexion.  

After sizing up Zhang Yan—noting his youth and his early-stage Qi Refinement cultivation—his expression turned serious.  

"Greetings, Junior Brother. I acquired this mask during an expedition outside the sect. Unfortunately, it was already broken when I found it."  

The vendor sighed.  

"I assume you noticed it because your spiritual perception couldn't detect it?"  

"Correct," Zhang Yan nodded.  

At the Qi Refinement stage, cultivators didn't yet possess true spiritual sense—only a weaker version called "spiritual perception," which could scan their immediate surroundings (about two to three zhang).  

"Because the mask is broken, it can't be detected when scanned. But if worn, the concealment effect is incomplete—people can still sense the wearer."  

The vendor's expression darkened with regret.  

If the mask were intact, it would've been an invaluable treasure—worth hundreds of spirit stones, rivaling even high-grade artifacts.  

But now?  

Broken.  

Worthless.  

For Zhang Yan, however, this was **fantastic news**.  

He didn't care about the physical condition of the item—only the effects it carried.  

What others saw as trash, he saw as priceless.  

Today, he had stumbled upon a **hidden gem**.  

"That's fine. I just think it looks interesting—I'll treat it as a decoration. How much, Senior Brother?"  

Though inwardly thrilled, Zhang Yan kept his expression neutral, offering a casual excuse.  

Given his young age, the explanation was believable.  

The vendor pondered briefly before replying, "If Junior Brother doesn't mind its condition... **15 spirit stones**."
