# Chapter 22: Spirit-Protecting Wall

Although Qin Chong's plan seemed well-laid, he couldn't help feeling uneasy at this moment.

In his previous life, he had some knowledge about the mining profession, but most of what he'd seen in news reports were negative stories. Working hundreds or even thousands of meters underground—no matter how thorough the safety measures—would naturally instill some fear.

The spirit stone mines here were far more terrifying than anything he'd known before, incomparable in both depth and scale. The underground tunnels formed a complex maze of varying sizes. Just imagining the dark spaces deep underground made his hair stand on end.

Yet to improve his cultivation, Qin Chong had to overcome these fears and discomforts.

Lying on the stone bed, staring at the rocky ceiling of his stone hut, Qin Chong found his thoughts unsettled.

This wasn't quite what he'd expected. Shouldn't they have provided a map of the mine tunnels? Moreover, shouldn't new miners receive operational procedures and safety guidelines?

Before he knew it, Qin Chong had drifted into sleep.

On the fourth day, as dawn's first light appeared, knocking sounded at his stone door.

"You must be Fellow Daoist Qin Chong?"

A sturdy middle-aged man stood outside Qin Chong's hut. Like Qin Chong, he was at the sixth level of Qi Refining.

"My name is Chen Mo. You'll follow me for your first month in the mines. We leave now."

With that, Chen Mo turned and walked away, forcing Qin Chong to hurry after him.

"Many thanks, Fellow Daoist Chen. I'll be in your care going forward."

"No trouble. This storage bag contains mining tools and will also hold any large spirit stones we collect. We'll turn everything in to the overseers when we come out."

Chen Mo handed Qin Chong a gray storage bag.

"Understood."

"Let's go. I'll explain more as we walk."

As they proceeded, Qin Chong listened to Chen Mo's instructions while discreetly examining the tools in the bag.

There was a wall-breaking pick, a spirit-digging hoe, and two smaller tools—a file and a saw. Though they appeared ordinary, they were actually crafted by artifact smiths specifically for mining spirit stones.

Qin Chong also found three blue moonstones for illumination in the tunnels.

Soon, they entered the main mining shaft, and the surrounding light gradually faded.

From Chen Mo's explanations, Qin Chong learned much about the mines, resolving some of his earlier confusion and gaining a preliminary understanding of the operation.

Chen Mo clearly knew the mines well. Even at depths of several li underground, his pace never slowed, and he navigated intersections without hesitation.

"Fellow Daoist Qin, now that we're deep in the mines, I can speak more freely about things best not mentioned above ground. Consider this advice—I hope you won't take offense."

Chen Mo's tone had changed, no longer as cold as before.

"Please speak freely, Fellow Daoist Chen. No need for formalities."

"First, don't get any foolish ideas—the consequences are severe. I've personally seen several people executed on the spot by Canglong Valley overseers for hiding spirit stones, their souls utterly destroyed."

"Of course. With my limited cultivation, how could I entertain such thoughts?"

"Our mining shifts last one month. Since I'm guiding you this time, I'll take half your earnings. Consider this an unwritten rule."

"That's only fair."

"Also, fighting is strictly prohibited underground. Discovered spirit stone veins go to whoever arrives first. The main dangers are cave-ins and subterranean demonic beasts, so stay alert."

"Understood!"

"That's all for now. I'll share more as things come to mind. Oh—I have a hand-drawn mine map available. Fifty spirit stones, if you're interested."

Qin Chong was taken aback. So this was why he'd heard nothing about maps earlier.

Though he only had sixty-three spirit stones left, Qin Chong immediately agreed to pay fifty for the rough map.

"Excellent! This will make things much easier."

The transaction was quickly completed.

"I didn't expect such decisiveness from someone so young. Feel free to ask me anything in the future."

"Certainly."

As they walked, Qin Chong skimmed the map. It showed main and secondary tunnels—not exhaustive, but sufficient.

After years of mining by the two great sects, the primary and secondary spirit veins had long been exhausted. Now they worked the scattered remnants at the veins' outermost edges, resulting in more distant and numerous branching tunnels.

They encountered no other miners along the way. With over a dozen main entrances and countless branching paths, experienced miners each had their own routes and established digging sites.

After two days, they reached Chen Mo's mining site. He embedded a moonstone into the ceiling, illuminating the small space.

Before Qin Chong stretched a several-zhang-long light green wall about one zhang high. To its right was a person-sized gap revealing faintly glowing spirit stones—clustered tightly together, requiring careful individual extraction.

"Watch closely how I remove a stone first. Then you'll excavate the spirit-protecting wall on the left and extract stones the same way."

"Understood. I appreciate your guidance."

"Fellow Daoist Chen, these all seem to be low-grade spirit stones. Are there no mid-grade ones here?"

"Hah! Mid-grade and above were mined out long ago. Finding a low-grade vein like this is already fortunate."

Chen Mo set to work, selecting a protruding stone and carefully sawing along its edges with the small saw. After about the time needed to drink tea, he removed the stone, then used the file to clean its surface. Another similar span of time passed before a clean low-grade spirit stone was fully extracted.

"Remember—if surface impurities aren't fully removed, you can't store it in your storage bag."

"Why is that?"

"The impurities are special—said to relate to how spirit veins form. Low-level spatial artifacts like storage bags can't contain them."

"I'll remember."

"Now start excavating the spirit-protecting wall over there, then extract stones as I showed you. And don't try attacking the wall with magical tools—they'll be destroyed."

"Thank you for the warning."

Qin Chong moved to the other side but didn't immediately begin. Instead, he carefully examined the wall, searching for a relatively weak spot.

Noticing this, Chen Mo gained new respect for the young man—despite his youth, Qin Chong was remarkably meticulous.
