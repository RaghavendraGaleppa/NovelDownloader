Chapter 33: Innate Primordial One Qi Divine Talisman

A long while later, Lu Yang held a yellowed talisman in his hand, examining it with keen interest.

After refining Liu Xin into a banner spirit, Lu Yang had him recount his life in detail, including how he trapped and killed Chen Xinan, and how he avoided being divined by Foundation Establishment cultivators.

"Innate Primordial One Qi Divine Talisman?"

"Indeed, it is this talisman," Liu Xin kowtowed, prostrating himself on the ground, and respectfully replied, "This talisman was left behind by an Innate Daoist. As long as one carries it, they can avoid karmic divination."

Lu Yang nodded in satisfaction. He then lightly shook the Myriad Spirit Banner. This time, the one who emerged from the banner was a handsome young man dressed in black robes. Upon seeing Lu Yang, the newcomer was momentarily stunned, then his gaze fell upon Liu Xin, who had already become a banner spirit, and his body immediately trembled.

"Hahaha... hahaha! So, you've met your match today!"

Chen Xinan laughed heartily, looking up at the sky, then turned to Liu Xin, "I thought you were already quite incompetent, but I never imagined your incompetence would exceed my wildest imagination."

"You were counter-refined into a banner spirit?"

"How did you manage that?"

"..." Faced with Chen Xinan's mockery, Liu Xin merely hung his head, showing no intention of replying. Only then did Chen Xinan turn to look at Lu Yang.

"As expected of a Sacred Sect disciple," Chen Xinan began with a compliment, clapping his hands and smiling, "Junior Brother, I don't ask you to release me for reincarnation. Besides, by killing Liu Xin, you've resolved a great hatred in my heart... How about this, I'll give you a secret treasure vault as repayment?"

"Now that I am also a banner spirit, you can naturally discern the truth from falsehood."

"That secret treasure vault is located on an island deep within the Sea of Clouds, called Gourd Island. Your cultivation is still low right now; it's best to go after reaching the Great Perfection of Qi Refining..."

"No need."

Hearing this, Lu Yang showed no sign of being tempted, shaking his head indifferently, "Senior Brother Chen, we are all Sacred Sect disciples, why bother putting on an act?"

"...Junior Brother has truly misunderstood me."

Chen Xinan sighed faintly, "Although most of us Sacred Sect disciples don't emphasize camaraderie, we always repay kindness. We are certainly not heartless and unrighteous villains..."

"Stop spouting nonsense and glorifying yourself." Lu Yang interrupted Chen Xinan without hesitation, sneering, "Where are the good people among the Sacred Sect disciples? Every single one who survives is a bad person! Senior Brother Chen, don't waste your effort, I won't go to your secret treasure vault."

Lu Yang harbored deep apprehension towards this True Disciple Senior Brother.

If there truly was such a secret treasure vault, why hadn't Liu Xin, who had held the Myriad Spirit Banner for so many years, gone to claim it? Most likely, he too feared Chen Xinan turning the tables on him and becoming the master.

This person's background was too profound, and his methods unfathomable, completely different from the likes of Liu Xin. Even as a banner spirit, he could not be fully trusted.

Chen Xinan's expression changed slightly, "Then why did you summon me out? What exactly do you intend?"

"Just conducting an experiment."

Lu Yang's tone was flat, but Chen Xinan detected danger in it and quickly said, "Wait, wait... I also know where there's a Foundation Establishment opportunity..."

Boom!

The next second, Lu Yang showed no hesitation. Disregarding the so-called Foundation Establishment opportunity, he directly dispersed Chen Xinan's true spirit, which had been refined onto the Myriad Spirit Banner.

"No—!"

"The previous life, the Remnant Heaven Peak Lord targeted me so much. In this life, I'll first beat his son to death to vent my anger. After a few more lives, when I reach Foundation Establishment, I'll go back and beat him to death!"

Lu Yang's expression was calm.

Carrying the [Book of One Hundred Lives], his Dao Heart was incredibly firm and unyielding. No matter how powerful his opponent, he was confident he would ultimately triumph.

As for Foundation Establishment opportunities? Coincidentally, he knew of one!

Chen Xinan's spiritual essence completely dissipated, his soul scattered. Lu Yang then put away the Myriad Spirit Banner, tidied up the scene, and began to wait in silence.

Not long after, Remnant Heaven Peak trembled violently!

A familiar oppressive sensation emerged, as if Mount Tai had descended upon him. Lu Yang immediately put on a frightened expression; he knew very well what it was.

It was the gaze of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Clearly, by completely killing Chen Xinan, he had alarmed the Remnant Heaven Peak Lord, who was now likely using karma to deduce the perpetrator.

Normally, he should have been discovered the next second.

Lu Yang waited in his cave abode for half an hour, but even after the oppressive sensation vanished, the Remnant Heaven Peak Lord still did not appear before him.

"...It really worked!"

He couldn't divine it!

Lu Yang's expression remained calm, but he was smiling inwardly. With this verification, he could finally cultivate the Nine Transformations Dragon Art with peace of mind in this life.

For his subsequent actions, Lu Yang replicated the strategies from his previous lives.

First, he speculated on Substitute Yin Puppets to earn contribution points, then he speculated on Yun Miaoqing to conceal his sword art and sword core, after which he purchased a large number of spirit pills and began secluded cultivation.

Ten years later.

In the blink of an eye, generations of disciples rose and fell, and the various commotions that had once surged returned to calm. The Sacred Sect's development trend remained stable and positive.

Only today, something seemed slightly different.

Heaven and Earth resonated, and Lu Yang's secluded cultivation cave abode seemed to become a vortex, as vast spiritual energy surged from all directions like a burst dam.

"This is... a celestial phenomenon!?"

"A Senior Brother has condensed his Qi Seed and broken through to the late-stage Qi Refining!"

Even within the Initial Sacred Sect, late-stage Qi Refining cultivators were considered high-level grunts, no longer easily treated as mere cannon fodder, and thus gained a certain degree of autonomy.

Thus, within Remnant Heaven Peak, the disciples who toiled and busied themselves for their daily survival, while inevitably amazed by the celestial phenomenon manifested during Lu Yang's breakthrough, harbored an even stronger envy, jealousy, and even resentment of "why wasn't it me?" beneath their awe.

Meanwhile, inside the cave abode, Lu Yang also opened his eyes.

Instantly, a flash of white lightning seemed to streak through the dim cultivation chamber, dazzling and compelling!

"The talk of bottlenecks is indeed well-deserved."

In this life, Lu Yang's cultivation speed was the same as in his previous lives, reaching the sixth layer of Qi Refining, the peak of the middle stage, in just three years. Yet, he wasted seven years at the bottleneck.

This was already due to his past experience of breaking through to the late-stage Qi Refining.

Otherwise, this period would likely have been even longer, making it clear why so many cultivators get stuck at this step, never advancing an inch throughout their entire lives.

Having just broken through, Lu Yang was not in a hurry to exit seclusion. Instead, he meditated for another three days until he had completely mastered the changes in his True Qi, physique, and spiritual sense before finally rising.

He opened the [Book of One Hundred Lives] panel:

[Name: Lu Yang]
[Age: 28]
[Cultivation: Qi Refining Layer Seven (Late Stage), Ninth-Rank Formation Master]
[Talents: Left Path Prodigy (White), Has a Few Tricks (Purple)]
[Cultivation Art: Nine Transformations Dragon Art (Seventh Layer)]
[Divine Abilities: Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art (Minor Accomplishment), Array Treasure Secret Unveiling (Complete), Killing Curse (Complete), Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light (Complete), Qi Concealment Art (Complete)]
[Treasures: Blood Sun Sword Core (High-grade Magic Treasure), Innate One Qi Myriad Spirit Banner (High-grade Magic Treasure)]
[Book of One Hundred Lives Pages: 95]

Though both were at the late-stage Qi Refining, Lu Yang in this life was far stronger than in his previous previous life. His True Qi wasn't even on the same level; if they truly fought, it would be a ten-zero win for him.

Especially after mastering the Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light, paired with the Blood-Washing Heavenly River Sword Formation Diagram, even if facing another late-stage Qi Refining cultivator, once enveloped by his formation, it would be a dead end unless they had a thorough understanding of his abilities and had prepared means to counter the Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light.

"However, it's still not completely safe."

The Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light's power was decent, but it was merely a divine ability that ordinary disciples could find. Who knew what formidable divine abilities the True Disciples possessed?

"True Disciples... I wonder if I'll have a chance?"

Lu Yang's face showed anticipation. With the divine talisman obscuring karma in this life, his identity was completely clean. Generally, he would easily become a target for recruitment.

After all, even for Foundation Establishment cultivators, a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator was a decent subordinate.

Moreover, unlike his previous previous life, he had not transformed into a blood shadow, and his path to immortality had not been severed. By all accounts, he should have some investment value.

Thus, Lu Yang had already made up his mind.

If a Foundation Establishment cultivator extended an olive branch, even if it was the Remnant Heaven Peak Lord, he wouldn't refuse. He would take the benefits first; vengeance could wait for the next life.

A man's knees are worth gold; today is the time to cash in!
