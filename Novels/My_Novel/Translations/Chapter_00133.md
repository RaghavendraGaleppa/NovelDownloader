Chapter 133: The General's Head and the Conquered Lady

Qi Biao immediately invited Xu Lifeng into the tent upon hearing his words.

"Who are you? Can you truly solve my urgent troubles? Hmph, if you dare deceive me, if you can walk out of here alive today, then I, Qi Biao, will take your surname!"

Qi Biao sat imposingly in the center of the tent, his eyes filled with suspicion as he scrutinized Xu Lifeng.

If it weren't for the flames burning his eyebrows, he would never have agreed to see a cowardly figure who dared not show his face in the light.

Xu Lifeng said, "What use would it be for me to deceive you?" He didn't care about Qi Biao's tone and casually picked up his teacup to take a sip. "The tea is cold."

He pinched his fingers toward the brazier, and a缕 of flame was actually caught between them. He held it under the teacup to heat it for a moment. Only when the water began to steam and the tea leaves danced within did he take another drink.

"Excellent skill!" Qi Biao was startled, realizing the other man was showing off on purpose.

"Please, speak quickly. If you can truly resolve my predicament, I will repay you generously," Qi Biao said.

Xu Lifeng smiled. "Your Yellow Dragon Army lacks money and food, and you are in a desperate situation, yet you have failed to capture Qingning County for a long time. Since that is the case, why not just raid the surrounding villages?"

Qi Biao replied disappointedly, "How could I not have thought of that?"

"It seems it didn't go well," Xu Lifeng said with a smile. "However, those villages are poor. Even if you loot them clean, there won't be much of value. I know of a good place and can recommend it to you."

"Where?" Qi Biao asked.

Xu Lifeng chuckled. Seeing that his plan was succeeding, a shrewd light flashed in his eyes. "It is the Yihe Manor to the west of Qingning County."

"It is a martial artist's manor, and the master is quite capable. But I imagine he cannot withstand ten thousand iron cavalry and would likely only flee. If you occupy the manor, the treasures, buildings, and food inside will surely solve your urgent needs."

"Is that true?" Qi Biao asked suspiciously. "I sent people to scout everywhere; how did I not know of this manor?"

"The useless county magistrate of Qingning County knows enough to close the city gates and defend. Is it really that difficult for the Yihe Manor to move trees and alter the roads to hide in the wilderness, avoiding your sharp edge?" Xu Lifeng said calmly.

Since ancient times, martial artists have established manors with their own considerations. In times of peace, they are mostly built by rivers for easy access to water. In times of chaos, they are mostly built in forests to avoid war.

Although martial artists have considerable strength and long lifespans, they are generally unwilling to face armies head-on. He could ensure his own safety, but if the treasures hidden in the manor were destroyed in the chaos, who wouldn't be heartbroken?

After Xu Lifeng had explained everything clearly, he turned and left. Qi Biao did not stop him but fell into deep thought.

"Raiding a martial artist's manor is indeed much easier than attacking a city. But if you earn the hatred of a martial artist and they wait for a chance to retaliate, that is also very troublesome."

Everything has its pros and cons.

Just as Qi Biao was hesitating, he suddenly heard a commotion in the army, the mood growing increasingly difficult to control.

"Press westward!" Qi Biao had no choice but to give the order from inside his tent.

Xu Lifeng stood in the shadows, sneering. He believed this plan to borrow a knife to kill was perfect.

"I left in the middle of the night; no one knows I was the one who leaked the information. When the Yellow Dragon Army presses forward, if the Lady of the Broken Sword is truly at the Yihe Manor, she will have to show herself. I will remain silent, and she won't know it was my doing. As long as I don't provoke her, I should be fine."

"If it isn't the Lady of the Broken Sword, I can take advantage of the chaos to enter the manor and capture that boy, thoroughly interrogating him for his superior martial arts."

Ever since he saw the Yellow Dragon Army attack the city, he had been hesitating, secretly pondering whether this plan was feasible. Seeing that the Yellow Dragon Army was困 by a lack of food, he knew it was highly likely to succeed, but he needed to starve them a bit more.

Hunger breeds courage.

Even if they are martial artists, provoking them is just part of the game.

"This Xu Lifeng really did come to leak information; he's still coveting that superior martial arts!" Li Xian thought to himself that things were bad.

He immediately shook off the mud on his body and ran back to the Yihe Manor as fast as he could. He ordered a strict defense of all key roads and prepared traps everywhere.

He could feel the ground shaking as the Yellow Dragon Army drew closer and closer.

Li Xian had moved trees and altered the roads to block the path. But in the end, he couldn't withstand the sheer numbers of the Yellow Dragon Army. The soldiers under his command spread over the mountains and forests like ants.

Even the most hidden paths would eventually be discovered. At night it was fine, as the pitch-black darkness provided a natural curtain.

But during the day, it was very不利.

A hint of dawn broke in the sky.

A soldier shouted excitedly, "General, I've found it! There really is a path here!" He pointed to a hidden trail.

"Excellent! Press forward, press forward!" Qi Biao roared with excitement.

The Yellow Dragon Army, like hungry tigers, followed the scent.

The forest path was originally narrow, but the soldiers trampled and chopped down trees, turning it into chaos in an instant.

Ding Hu, who had been guarding this place, charged out fiercely. "Brothers, fight them to the death!"

The hidden guards swarmed out, forming their own formations to defend the key path. They clashed head-on with the Yellow Dragon Army, blocking them at this point.

The first wave of battle began.

The sound of swords and blades rang out.

The Yihe Manor was doing its best to use the terrain to its advantage. The guards possessed martial arts internal energy. Ding Hu and the others wore excellent armor, capable of fighting dozens of men alone. They were fierce and courageous, and they weren't about to be defeated quickly.

But the enemy had the numbers.

If this continued, the Yihe Manor was bound to lose.

Amidst the clashing of weapons, Li Xian remained calm, thinking of a strategy to break the situation.

"Other than being somewhat hidden, the Yihe Manor doesn't have much of a terrain advantage. There are no natural, dangerous passes to block tens of thousands of troops."

"Under a direct confrontation, destruction is inevitable."

"The only option now is... to capture the leader to capture the bandits. But in the chaos of the army, it won't be easy to take Qi Biao's head. Moreover, Qi Biao's martial arts skill doesn't seem to be weak..."

"Now, I must wait for the right moment and try to kill him with a single arrow!"

Li Xian did not join the battle, hiding within the manor to prevent exposing his strength and making Qi Biao wary.

He looked around.

The tallest building in the manor was the "Moon Watching Tower." It was nine stories high, with each story being three zhang tall. The entire tower was twenty-seven zhang high, nearly a hundred meters.

It was built for the Lady to observe the weather and the heavens.

Li Xian quickly climbed the tower, lying in wait at its peak. He observed the intense battle outside, but Qi Biao was very cautious and did not charge forward at the head of the army.

"The timing isn't right... Qi Biao is definitely wearing heavy armor. Even with the Lady's Lingyu Arrow, I need to let them get closer to ensure it can pierce through his armor!"

Li Xian held his breath and steadied his heart. He had already spotted Qi Biao in the midst of the ten thousand soldiers. The distance was extremely far. Although he was confident he could hit him, he wasn't confident he could kill him with one shot.

The guards, servants, and tenant farmers were gradually retreating.

They had already been pushed back from the key path, losing their terrain advantage, and their defeat would only come faster.

"Brothers, charge!"
"Forward, if you don't want to die!"

The drums of the Yellow Dragon Army beat, and they advanced courageously. At this point, casualties were mounting, and many guards, servants, and tenant farmers had already fallen.

The scene was horrific.

Seeing the favorable situation, Qi Biao laughed heartily. Having pressed his army to this point, he could already see the pavilions and towers within the manor. There must be countless treasures inside.

Greed overshadowed his previous hesitation.

"Hm?"

Qi Biao suddenly saw a figure slowly standing up on the tall tower in the manor. Because the distance was so great, even when the figure stood, it was just a black speck.

"What is that..."

"Raise the bow!"

Qi Biao's eyes widened. Under the scorching sun, the figure had already drawn the bow to its full extent. The golden bowstring reflected the sunlight, exceptionally dazzling.

The figure's robes fluttered, exuding an indescribable calmness and spirit. Qi Biao suddenly felt his hair stand on end. His intuition told him this arrow was prepared for him.

In an instant. It felt like a thorn in his back and a lump in his throat. A great crisis of life and death was right before him. The mighty commander of the Yellow Dragon Army was so scared his legs went weak.

He clearly knew the other was about to shoot him.

But he had no idea how to dodge or evade.

Li Xian gathered his energy and shouted, "Dog, dare you receive my arrow!"

An arrow of spirit must be released. A hidden arrow kills unseen, while an arrow of spirit kills in front of thousands of eyes, under the bright sun.

If not, how could it be called an arrow of spirit?

This great shout pushed his entire spirit to its absolute peak.

The youth stood firm at the tower's peak, the sharpness of his arrow was unstoppable.

His shout caused the two sides locked in battle to momentarily cease. Tens of thousands of people simultaneously lowered their weapons, their gazes fixed on Li Xian.

He stood high above, his foot on the tower's peak, his spirit rivaling the sun itself.

Then, he relaxed his fingers.

The Lingyu Arrow left the string, scraping through the air with a "hissing" sound. The sound was neither light nor heavy, like a feather brushing past one's heart.

In absolute silence.

The arrow flew through the thousands of soldiers and horses, shooting straight towards Qi Biao's chest, aiming for his heart!

With a "thump," Qi Biao fell from his horse. The Yellow Dragon Army, seeing their commander dead, fell into complete panic. Their hands and feet went weak, and they couldn't raise any will to fight.

Just then.

Qi Biao flipped back onto his horse, spitting several mouthfuls of blood, and laughed wildly. His teeth were stained red, but the demeanor of a military commander was fully displayed.

The arrow had pierced his heart.

But Qi Biao had revealed his Transformation Phase... he was of the [Double Heart Phase]. Since the day he manifested his phase, he had two hearts. He had never told anyone this, precisely to防备暗箭偷袭 on the battlefield.

One of Qi Biao's hearts was pierced, but instead, his blood surged. Although his injury was severe, his spirit was also intense. Filled with hatred, he roared in anger:

"I have received your arrow! I shall return it with a hundred and eight thousand blades!"

This shout shook the air.

The Yellow Dragon banner flew high, the Yellow Dragon danced, baring its claws and teeth. The soldiers raised their weapons high and shouted, "A hundred and eight thousand blades! A hundred and eight thousand blades!"

At this moment, the army's will was consolidated. Even if the gates of Qingning County were here, they would be enough to breach them.

The soldiers' morale was at an all-time high. A commander who had his heart pierced yet did not die—how else could you explain it if not by the Mandate of Heaven?

Li Xian frowned. The first shot of a spirit arrow had the greatest power, making one forget everything and forcing them to take the arrow with their body. If he shot a second arrow, the target would be on guard.

But in this situation, he had to burn his boats! He drew his bow and took another arrow. His spirit was not intimidated by the "hundred and eight thousand blades" shouted by the heroes.

He murmured to himself, "What do I have to fear?"

He drew the bow to its full extent. Qi Biao waved his hand, and his personal guards holding iron shields moved in front of him, defending him严密ly, leaving no opening.

"I am favored by the Mandate of Heaven! Even if your archery is invincible, the Yellow Dragon will not die, and the Mandate belongs to me!" Qi Biao shouted.

"Is that so?"

Just then, a clear sound echoed across the battlefield.

Behind Li Xian, there was now an additional woman in white. Her white dress was as pure as snow, fluttering and elegant. Her beauty was so radiant that the thousands of soldiers couldn't take their eyes off her.

Her fair hand rested on Li Xian's, smooth as jade, warm and delicate.

The two of them actually shot an arrow together!

An arrow was released.

It shook the heavens and the earth.

It blasted through the armor, shattered the chest, pierced the heart, and destroyed the commander.

It was unstoppable.

The Qi Biao, who had just claimed the Mandate of Heaven, had both his hearts destroyed under this arrow and died instantly!

Lady Wen gently waved her sleeve. Li Xian was enveloped by a gust of wind and descended into the ranks of the soldiers.

He understood the Lady's intention. His black blade left its sheath, and he decapitated Qi Biao in one strike, standing atop the strange horse.

With his back to the Lady and facing the ten thousand soldiers, his momentum was now peerless. He revealed his [Heavy Pupil Phase], and his aura pressed down like a mountain, as if it could snap a spine from thin air.

He raised Qi Biao's head high and shouted, "Why don't you surrender!"

His voice was like a dragon or a tiger, shaking the heavens and the earth, striking fear into the hearts of the souls.

His imposing manner was like a tiger amidst a flock of sheep.

The fluttering Yellow Dragon banner, with a "crack," actually snapped on its own.

They could only say that the youth's divine might was unmatched. Simply holding the head was enough to subdue the ten thousand soldiers.

Lady Wen had rich experience and had seen countless prodigies and heroes, but in this scene, even for her, her beautiful eyes rippled, and her red lips moved slightly.

She felt an indescribable, strange feeling.
