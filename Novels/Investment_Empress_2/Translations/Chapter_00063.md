# Chapter 63: The Princess's Heaven-Defying Sword Talent and the Poor Ice Cube

“Teacher… if I practice with you… will there be a day… when the dead… can be brought back to life?”

There was a flickering glimmer of hope in Jiang Chulong’s eyes.

It was because of her mother that the Emperor hated her.

If… if she could bring her mother back to life?

Hearing this, Primordial Heavenly尊—also known as Little Li—fell into deep thought.

Could it be done?

At the very least, he had never heard of any method that could bring the dead back to life.

Since obtaining his Little World, he understood even more that life is a true miracle of creation. Even as the master of a world, he could not create life out of thin air.

Did the历代 emperors of the Great Yu Dynasty not desire immortality?

If such a method existed, why not resurrect the Grand Ancestor Martial Emperor?

However, he had the System.

The System was an existence beyond reason…

Perhaps it was because of this thought, or perhaps he couldn't bear to shatter her hope.

Li Mo eventually nodded.

“There is.”

Jiang Chulong felt as if struck by lightning, freezing in place. The spark of hope in her eyes burned even brighter.

She wanted to become strong!

“I am truly amazing.”

Watching the girl across from him clench her small fists and cheer herself on, Little Li let out a long sigh.

It was truly not easy to bluff a princess like that.

Fortunately, as a资深 bookworm, he had a rich储备 of knowledge!

When it came to bragging, no one could compare to those damn novel writers.

Little Princess Jiang was probably completely fooled.

“Teacher… Teacher is amazing…”

“Thank you… you…”

The girl suddenly stood up and bowed deeply. Her thin shoulders trembled slightly with excitement.

She was like a small white flower in the ruins; as long as she caught a glimmer of light, she would desperately grow toward the sun…

*Gasp.*

How should I put this.

Little Li felt a tiny bit of guilt in his heart.

It hurt his conscience to deceive such a姑娘.

However.

Little Princess Jiang really needed some confidence.

It was a white lie after all…

“Alright, regarding the more secret matters, this尊 will not speak of them to you. Sometimes, knowing too much brings no benefit.”

“You simply need to follow this尊 and practice diligently starting today. Given time, the Great Yu Dynasty will only be able to crawl at your feet.”

“Hmm!”

Jiang Chulong nodded seriously and vigorously.

If an outsider heard this bizarre conversation, they would definitely think both of them had gone crazy.

But after learning of the Heavenly尊 Teacher’s origins, Little Princess Jiang was already deeply convinced.

“Then… Teacher… what are you… going to teach me first?”

“Hmm, since you have never practiced martial arts before, we shall start from the most basic Qi and Blood Realm.”

Li Mo lowered his deep, melancholic baritone voice.

“A towering building rises from the ground; you must take it one step at a time.”

“Although your Sword Bone was dug out, precisely because of that, the potential of your Innate Sword Embryo has been stimulated, making your foundation even more solid.”

Hearing the praise, Jiang Chulong lowered her head shyly.

She didn't expect that, according to the Teacher, having the Sword Bone dug out could actually be a good thing?

“Teacher… can I… cultivate my own method?”

*Huh?*

Li Mo was slightly taken aback.

He had been thinking for a long time about what martial art to prepare for Jiang Chulong in the Qi and Blood Realm.

“Hmm… you said… I should walk my own path…”

Jiang Chulong stammered.

Little Li understood.

Little Princess Jiang meant that although she hadn't learned martial arts, during her time in the Tianshan Sword Manor, she had observed many swords, even though they were all damaged.

There was an old caretaker of the Sword Tomb who often took her for walks inside.

Thus.

As if by instinct, she had grasped a martial art.

But her father forbade her from practicing, so she never dared to.

“Recite the general outline for me to hear.”

“Hmm… it’s… it’s quite crude… please… guide me, Teacher.”

Jiang Chulong recited what she had领悟ed.

The halting voice echoed within the Seed of the World.

Li Mo grew increasingly silent as he listened.

Was this sword martial art strong?

Not really, it was merely a mid-tier martial art. For him, finding a similar one would be effortless.

But the key point was that Little Princess Jiang had never practiced martial arts!

She领悟ed it on her own!

---

How is this fair to others?

It took him decades to master a mid-tier sword art himself!

“T-Teacher?”

Seeing the Heavenly尊 Teacher remain silent, Jiang Chulong thought her creation was too crude.

And that it had dissatisfied the Teacher.

She said weakly:

“I… I can still improve it… in the future… in the future I can… make this martial art… stronger.”

She didn't realize.

Every word she spoke was like a sword stabbing into Li Mo’s chest.

Without comparison, there is no harm.

She dealt true damage, and it was a critical hit.

Fortunately, Little Li was no ordinary person; he was a man who lived daily with the Red Fate Ice Cube.

“Cough… it’s not… bad.”

“Teacher… why are you… stammering too…”

Jiang Chulong panicked.

“I was just deducing this martial art just now.”

Li Mo coughed lightly. After a moment of thought, his voice returned to its calm tone:

“It’s not bad. If you practice according to this, you should be able to reach this尊’s expectations.”

“Yay! I can practice martial arts now!”

Jiang Chulong happily jumped up; she didn't even stutter this time.

But then, she glanced at the Heavenly尊 Teacher, stuck out her tongue, and sat down carefully.

“Your body is still relatively weak right now.”

“So, what you need to do now is to recover as soon as possible, strengthen your meridians, and lay the foundation for the future.”

“Also, since you lost your Sword Bone and your body is depleted, you need to recover your vitality.”

With a wave of his sleeve, two jade bottles appeared on the table.

They were all relatively gentle elixirs that could replenish the body.

One was the Innate Vitality Elixir he had taken before, and the other was the gentlest healing pill. Although it couldn't restore the body instantly, it was steady and without hidden dangers.

“Thank you… thank you… Heavenly尊 Teacher!”

Jiang Chulong珍视地 stored the elixirs into her怀里, then patted them, finally letting out a breath of relief. A happy smile curved her small lips.

Given her hamster-like nature, she probably wouldn't even want to throw away the bottles after finishing the pills.

At that very moment.

A notification sounded in his ear.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Jiang Chulong' and helping her recover her body.】

【You have an investment feedback. Would you like to claim it now?】

Li Mo temporarily ignored the reward.

Instead, he looked at Jiang Chulong again.

Having been allowed to practice for the first time, she looked eager. Her dim pupils were filled with three words:

“Curiosity.”

Li Mo: “……”

A teacher is one who transmits the Way, imparts knowledge, and resolves doubts.

This was stumping him.

He couldn't make this up, could he?

“If you have any doubts, you can ask now.”

“But to prevent you from being too ambitious, I will answer them for you next time.”

“Yes!”

……

Opening his eyes, it was already dusk outside.

Inside the Autumn Water Pavilion.

“What should I do?”

“I can barely remember those questions.”

Li Mo opened his eyes and looked at the ceiling.

Taking the questions to ask someone else?

Hmm, first, eliminate the Master…

As he thought about it, he walked downstairs and entered the kitchen.

Before he got close, he smelled a burnt odor.

Li Mo subconsciously looked up, then fell silent, his eyes filling with confusion.

The state of the kitchen could be described as a disaster.

It was because the Ice Cube was cooking in front of the stove.

The lump in the pot, unknown what it was, was black and smoking.

It was just missing the words “Dark Cuisine” written on it.

Li Mo seriously suspected that eating it might cause him to roll his eyes and foam at the mouth instantly.

“You’re back?”

The Ice Cube wiped her face.

Thus.

Her flawless jade-like face was added another streak of soot, like a little kitten.

“Yeah, I came back a bit too late.”

Li Mo felt like crying.

Was this how the Ice Cube survived the days he wasn't around?!
