# Chapter 15: Fishing

"Who made a deal with you? Next lifetime, maybe!"

"With the Book of a Hundred Lifetimes, at worst I'll just take the 'Myriad Chariot Dragon Ascension Scripture' this lifetime, and then the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art' in the next. They'll still be mine!"

From the start, Lu Yang had never trusted Zhao Xuhe.

What talk of sharing scriptures? It was nothing but an expedient. Lu Yang was certain that as long as Zhao Xuhe escaped, he would find a way to kill him.

Unfortunately, Zhao Xuhe was stronger. Lu Yang wasn't absolutely confident he could kill him and eliminate future troubles; in a real death match, it might even be Lu Yang who died.

Moreover, the loan was about to expire, and he couldn't possibly repay it. His time in this life was already running out. So, the moment he got his hands on the scripture, Lu Yang decisively self-destructed.

[You self-destructed defiantly and died.]
[Current remaining pages of the Book of a Hundred Lifetimes: 97]
[Restarting a new life, you can choose one of the following gains from your previous life:
One: Treasure.
Two: Cultivation.
Three: Lifespan.
Four: Forfeit all gains and randomly awaken a talent based on your previous life's experiences.]

"Those whose names are called, step forward."

Lu Yang's consciousness cleared. Liu Xin's familiar, detestable voice rang out from the stage, but Lu Yang ignored it, saying in his mind, "I choose cultivation."

Boom!

The next second, Lu Yang felt a surge of true qi erupt from his dantian, rapidly flowing through his limbs and bones, furiously transforming his essence, qi, and spirit. However, he gritted his teeth and circulated the Qi Concealment Art he obtained from the three black-clad figures, completely hiding all commotion beneath his skin.

A moment later, Lu Yang exhaled a deep breath of murky air.

"I'm back!"

Qi Condensation Fourth Layer, mid-stage!

He looked up again at Liu Xin on the stage. Lu Yang no longer felt the fear he had experienced upon their first meeting. At this point, Liu Xin was only at the Qi Condensation Sixth Layer!

Only after he selected a nominal disciple and refined them into Innate Primordial Qi could he break through his bottleneck and reach the late stage of Qi Condensation. Only then might he be able to see through Lu Yang's Qi Concealment Art. Before that, even if Lu Yang stood right in front of him, Liu Xin would only perceive him as an ordinary person.

"But there's also an unexpected surprise..."

Lu Yang inwardly examined his dantian, only to find a wisp of hazy white qi floating within it—the Innate Primordial Qi from his previous life! It was still there in this life!

"I understand... The Book of a Hundred Lifetimes doesn't revert to the initial anchor point, but to my previous life!"

This was undoubtedly good news.

Because it meant that any treasures, cultivation, or even lifespan he chose in each life could be retained in the next, without having to start from scratch every time.

Lu Yang's actions proceeded as usual.

Ascend the stage, be assigned, Pleasure Hall.

Counter-kill Yu Suzhen.

Lie low, break through three months later, and quietly become a formal disciple.

"In this life, according to my plan, besides the remaining scroll of the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art', there are two other major events worth attempting."

The first was naturally "Merit Lottery".

Lu Yang stayed in his cave dwelling for a few days, then headed to the Merit Hall, took on a "Accumulate Merit" task, and then galloped straight to the Merit Pond without stopping.

"2025113!"

Standing among the crowd around the Merit Pond, Lu Yang stylishly combed his hair, beginning to imagine how he would spend the grand prize if he won the Merit Pond lottery.

A billion, oh a billion, enough to spend for an entire lifetime~!

Goodbye, poverty, I'll miss you...

The next second, a commotion erupted in the crowd. Countless people looked at Lu Yang in surprise, as well as the Merit Fish pulled out by the number he had chosen.

"Brother, good luck," someone approached Lu Yang, their tone envious: "A purple Merit Fish. While it's only slightly better than white and blue, it's still quite rare."

"...What?"

Lu Yang tilted his head, a line of question marks appearing above it.

Purple Merit Fish?

Not colorful?

Lu Yang quickly looked at the Merit Fish he had drawn; it was unmistakably glowing with a blue light. He then checked the number he had chosen; 2025113 was also correct.

Why didn't I win?!

Could it be that the lucky person from his previous life, Xiao Shiye, had lied? But he couldn't possibly have known that someone could restart a life, so there was no reason for him to lie.

In that case...

"There's insider dealing!"

Lu Yang's hands trembled with anger, his face flushed scarlet. Only then did he understand: What lucky person? That Xiao Shiye was clearly a designated shill!

"Forget it, it's still a Merit Fish after all..." Lu Yang could only console himself this way. Purple was considered rare, second only to gold and colorful. Although he missed out on the billion-point grand prize, eating the purple Merit Fish would probably allow his cultivation to quickly reach the fifth layer of Qi Condensation.

Thinking this, Lu Yang felt much better.

Then, to be safe, he didn't take the Merit Fish back to his cave dwelling. Instead, he consumed it on the spot in front of everyone, then began to regulate his breathing and circulate his cultivation to refine it.

After doing all this, Lu Yang clearly felt the few gazes on him disperse.

The result was as he expected: the essence from the purple Merit Fish allowed him to successfully break through to the fifth layer of Qi Condensation, and even brought him to the threshold of the sixth layer.

"This is just purple. If it were colorful..."

Lu Yang's heart yearned for it. After all, in his previous life, Xiao Shiye had gone from the first layer of Qi Condensation directly to Great Perfection overnight after consuming the colorful Merit Fish.

"Never mind, I won't force it."

Lu Yang quickly regained his composure. The first matter had failed, but there was still a chance for the second: the "Substitute Death Puppet Price Bubble Incident."

Old Man Wang Bairong of the Scripture Pavilion had almost lost everything because of this, and was then deceived by Zhao Xuhe, becoming cannon fodder for Panlong Island. But ultimately, this was because Wang Bairong entered the market too late. Lu Yang was different; he knew the timing of this price bubble's fluctuations very well.

"There's actually already an upward trend now."

Lu Yang opened his disciple token to check the price of Substitute Death Puppets, finding that there were indeed slight fluctuations. Clearly, insiders were manipulating the market.

"To enter the market, I still lack a sufficient amount of capital..."

Lu Yang thought for a moment, then turned and headed to the Merit Hall.

As expected, as a newly initiated disciple, he was a little fat lamb ripe for slaughter in the eyes of the older disciples. Before long, Zhao Xuhe proactively walked over.

"Junior Brother, you don't look well. Have you run into some difficulties?"

Lu Yang looked up, forcing a bitter smile: "What difficulties could there be? It's just a lack of money. Senior Brother, do you know of any tasks that can earn contribution points?"

"So it's money you lack... Yes, I've been there, Junior Brother. When I was your age, I was also worried about contribution points, stressed out every day, and my Dao partner even disliked me and broke up with me... Sigh, there are endless tasks every day, and life feels utterly hopeless."

Zhao Xuhe sighed, acting as if he shared Lu Yang's plight.

After speaking, he patted Lu Yang's shoulder and said, "I've wasted half my life, and only recently did I summarize a universally applicable truth."

"That is, money is dead."

"So, you must make money generate more money, use contribution points to earn more contribution points. Only then will you avoid becoming a slave of the Sacred Sect and break free from this beast-of-burden like fate!"

Upon hearing this, Lu Yang immediately showed an expression of admiration: "Listening to your words, Senior Brother, is better than ten years of study!"

However, Lu Yang quickly lowered his head in dejection: "But Senior Brother, I don't even have any contribution points right now. What would I use to earn more?"

"Too small! Your perspective is too small!"

Zhao Xuhe's expression grew even friendlier, and he showed a toothy smile: "Although you don't have money now, you can borrow it! You can just repay it after you've earned some, can't you?"

"But..." Lu Yang still looked hesitant.

Seeing a potential deal, how could Zhao Xuhe let it go? He quickly said, "How about this? I see that you and I are fated, Junior Brother, so I'll lend you a sum!"

Lu Yang's eyes instantly lit up: "Really?"

Seeing his eager, covetous expression, Zhao Xuhe immediately confirmed it: the fish had taken the bait!

"Of course, it's real!"

Zhao Xuhe patted his chest to guarantee it, then pulled out the so-called Three Rivers Society's signboard, before finally asking Lu Yang, "Junior Brother, how much do you plan to borrow?"

After a moment of silence, Lu Yang raised two fingers.

"Two hundred?"

"Two thousand!"

Lu Yang's face was resolute: "To be honest, I haven't used my cultivation technique loan yet, which is equivalent to 1000 contribution points. Plus my new disciple benefits: the Bone Flying Sword, Qi-Blood Pills, Human-Faced Owl... I'll use these as collateral, Senior Brother Zhao. Can you lend me 2000 contribution points?"

Zhao Xuhe was stunned.

Are young people nowadays all so reckless in their actions?

I've only just started to con you, and you're already going all-in?

Before Zhao Xuhe could even react, Lu Yang uttered words that shocked him even more: "Senior Brother Zhao, I plan to buy Substitute Death Puppets with my entire capital."

"What!?"

Zhao Xuhe was first shocked, then as if he'd remembered something, he quickly lowered his voice: "Junior Brother... You wouldn't happen to know some insider information, would you?"

"Senior Brother is discerning," Lu Yang also whispered. "When I was choosing a cultivation technique in the Scripture Pavilion earlier, I overheard Senior Brother Wang Bairong at the entrance saying that the war in the south wasn't going well, and the mass grave that produces Substitute Death Puppets had fallen. But the Sacred Sect has secretly suppressed the related news..."

"Hiss!"

As soon as these words were spoken, Zhao Xuhe immediately drew a sharp breath. Then, intense greed surfaced in his eyes; he had clearly sniffed out a business opportunity as well.

If the news was true, then the chance to get rich had arrived!

Watching the agitated Zhao Xuhe, Lu Yang sneered inwardly.

The fish has taken the bait!
