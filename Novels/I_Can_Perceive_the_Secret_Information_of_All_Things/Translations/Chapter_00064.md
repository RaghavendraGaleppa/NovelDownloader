# Chapter 64: "Master the Art of Thousand-Mile Travel Without Leaving Your Home"

Xiao Ji's trip to the Nether Valley had yielded excellent results, far exceeding his expectations.  

With one thousand Xuan-grade spirit stones—equivalent to ten thousand Huang-grade stones based on the current decimal exchange rate in the cultivation world—this was already an impressive haul for someone completing their first mission in the Ancient City of Tai.  

Additionally, he had obtained a Grade 1, Tier 12 spider demon core and a venom sac. Though their exact market value was still uncertain, they were undoubtedly worth a considerable sum.  

While he had given the winged tiger demon core to Qian Duoyu, a wealthy heir from a mining family wouldn’t take something for nothing. During their conversation, Qian Duoyu promised to gift Xiao Ji something he liked when they visited the auction house together the next day.  

The only regret was that the fierce Li Zhenren had been crushed by the mother winged tiger, destroying all his artifacts and elixirs. Otherwise, a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s belongings would surely have been valuable.  

Back at the inn, Xiao Ji unfolded a map of the Ancient City of Tai that he had extorted from a scammer during his first visit. The map was practical, with detailed annotations of notable locations, including the auction house, complete with brief descriptions and unique features.  

After familiarizing himself with the auction house’s layout, Xiao Ji relaxed and went to sleep.  

The next morning, he enjoyed a hearty breakfast of beast-meat buns and a bowl of spirit rice porridge before heading to the auction house in high spirits.  

Qian Duoyu was punctual, already waiting with a bright smile when Xiao Ji arrived.  

"Daoist Xiao, what a coincidence!" Qian Duoyu greeted cheerfully.  

"If we hadn’t arranged this yesterday, it might actually count as one," Xiao Ji replied with a chuckle.  

This was their second outing together—this time, to the auction house.  

The auction house was a battlefield without bloodshed. Whether buying a stone or selling a piece of cloth, it was all commerce, varying only in intensity and the degree of scheming involved.  

Standing beneath the grand plaque of the Ancient City of Tai’s auction house, the two looked up in awe.  

"Wow~" Qian Duoyu let out an exaggerated exclamation.  

Xiao Ji sighed inwardly. *A wealthy mining heir shouldn’t act like he’s never seen the world.* "Keep your expression neutral, or you’ll attract swindlers. Right now, there are five con artists, three thieves, and one predator eyeing you. Lower your presence, or you might not leave the city safely."  

Qian Duoyu quickly toned down his excitement. "Is it really that dangerous?"  

"Where there’s profit, there’s never safety," Xiao Ji replied.  

An auction house was a vital part of any major city. Without one, a city wouldn’t be considered significant, and foot traffic would suffer.  

Despite the early hour, the auction house was already bustling. The building, seemingly three stories tall, actually rivaled the height of a ten-story structure. Two massive stone pi xiu statues flanked the entrance, their glaring eyes seemingly intent on emptying every visitor’s purse.  

Guards in the city’s uniform stood watch, their sharp eyes scanning the crowd as if everyone were a potential thief. Their presence ensured order.  

Given the treasures stored within—some even priceless—the auction house’s security was second only to the city lord’s residence.  

Powerful artifacts hung around the building, defensive formations were carved into the walls, and divine talismans were hidden among the roof’s decorative beasts.  

History had seen fools attempt to rob the auction house, only to meet gruesome ends. Thieves with exceptional skills had tried and failed, paraded through the streets before public execution.  

The auction house welcomed all—noble and common, wealthy cultivators and impoverished beggars alike.  

"I love this atmosphere," Qian Duoyu said, brimming with excitement.  

Xiao Ji understood. The mining heir, confined at home for too long, found novelty in the lively scene.  

"Everyone does, but don’t forget why we’re here," Xiao Ji reminded him.  

"Right, I’m here to buy beast milk," Qian Duoyu whispered.  

The auction house was well-organized. Xiao Ji had studied its layout the night before. Given its vast size, they only needed to focus on areas relevant to their current needs.  

The auction house was divided into four main sections:  

1. **Item Auction Area**: Where cultivators sold their wares, subject to strict requirements.  
2. **Public Trading Area**: Where buyers could purchase items directly from displays.  
3. **Live Auction Area**: The core section for high-value auctions, often featuring rare treasures.  
4. **Public Information Exchange**: A resting area with bulletin boards for news and gossip.  

Xiao Ji and Qian Duoyu headed to the Public Trading Area.  

Barriers and counters separated staff from visitors. The area was further divided into categories: artifacts, elixirs, techniques, curiosities, and demon beasts.  

The uniformed female attendants behind the counters wore polite smiles, exuding warmth.  

Xiao Ji stopped at an elixir counter, scanning the notice board listing available items, prices, and quantities. Buyers could purchase directly by completing the transaction paperwork.  

Sellers would later collect their earnings based on the sales records.  

Some items remained unsold if their owners perished outside the auction house. After a set period, the auction house would liquidate such goods in a clearance sale. To mitigate criticism, the city often donated a portion of these proceeds to charity.  

Xiao Ji noticed no Foundation Establishment Pills were available in the public section—such rare items were likely reserved for live auctions.  

Since the live auction wouldn’t start until noon, he accompanied Qian Duoyu in purchasing supplies for the winged tiger cub, primarily beast milk.  

Qian Duoyu bought every available type of beast milk and even picked up some toy-like artifacts for the cub.  

His spending spree extended to personal indulgences, making Xiao Ji wince.  

"Brother Xiao, look at this underground firecracker—so fun! I’m buying it."  
"Brother Xiao, this rainbow butterfly illusion stone is fascinating! I’m taking it."  
"Brother Xiao, this Diamond Finger technique looks interesting! I’ll get it."  

Though Xiao Ji knew Qian Duoyu was wealthy, such extravagance was excessive. He tried to intervene once—with little effect.  

When Qian Duoyu reached for the Diamond Finger technique, Xiao Ji advised, "Friend Qian, this technique is for Core Formation cultivators and isn’t even aligned with your Qi path. It’s useless to you now."  

"I might never use it, but I want it now. Whether it fits my path doesn’t matter—what matters is that I like it!" Qian Duoyu’s reply was disarmingly simple.  

From then on, Xiao Ji stopped offering advice.  

In the technique manual section, Xiao Ji paused. His heightened perception had picked up a high-quality item at an excellent price.
