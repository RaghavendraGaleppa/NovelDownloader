# Chapter 32: Yang Shou's Strange Reaction

Ding Rui and Mu Tian stopped at the entrance of spiritual field 377.

Ding Rui couldn't help but hesitate, "Should we just go in like this?"

"Of course not. You go in and trick him out!" Mu Tian said.

"Why trick him out?" Ding Rui asked.

"There's a formation inside the spiritual field. If I go in, I can't directly attack him. Getting him out is naturally the best choice. If he doesn't comply, I'll just restrain him directly." Mu Tian explained.

Ding Rui heard this and thought it made some sense, so he took a deep breath, lifted his feet, and walked inside.

Mu Tian, meanwhile, hid to the side, waiting quietly.

In fact, Mu Tian could have gone in with Ding Rui. Inside the spiritual field, even if Yang Shou was unwilling to comply, the field's formation could control him. But he didn't want to do that. All these years he had spent in the spiritual field district, he had always yearned to go to the battlefield and kill enemies, but it had never materialized. Now that there was a chance to act, he naturally didn't want to miss it. Stealing immature spiritual rice was a truly grave mistake; he could absolutely suppress him! Mu Tian felt a faint excitement in his heart.

A moment later, Ding Rui and Yang Shou walked out together.

"Why exactly you took it, only you know." Mu Tian said coldly. He was already prepared to act; as long as this person didn't cooperate, he could easily capture him.

"This... I really don't know." Yang Shou said with a wry smile, then looked at Ding Rui and said, "Senior Brother Ding, did you say something nonsense in front of Senior Brother Mu?"

Ding Rui did not answer.

"We've had no grievances in the past, no enmity recently, why do you have to use such methods to deal with me, to frame me?" Yang Shou looked very wronged.

Ding Rui didn't answer Yang Shou's question. Instead, he turned to Mu Tian and said firmly, "Senior Brother Mu, I can guarantee that I saw Yang Shou secretly picking immature spiritual rice, and I'm willing to take full responsibility for what I've said. He only took the spiritual rice a short while ago, so he probably hasn't had time to deal with it. As long as we apprehend him and go into the spiritual field to ask where Yang Shou went at noon, we'll definitely find it!"

Yang Shou's expression changed, and his eyes, as he looked at Ding Rui, concealed a deep hatred.

Mu Tian nodded at Ding Rui, then turned to Yang Shou and said, "If you're certain you didn't take anything, then surrender. We'll go in and investigate. If Ding Rui truly wronged you, he will naturally bear the responsibility. The sect will not wrong any innocent person, nor will I."

Yang Shou naturally couldn't let Mu Tian go in and investigate, much less surrender. His secret was truly serious and deep.

"Sharp-tongued..." Yang Shou gritted his teeth, clearly not expecting Ding Rui to be so sharp-tongued. As his voice grew deeper and deeper, his gaze completely turned cold, as if he was about to lunge at Ding Rui the next moment.

Ding Rui involuntarily took a few steps back. With Mu Tian here, there was no need for him to do anything.

Yang Shou's behavior also made Mu Tian angry. Looking at Yang Shou, his true essence began to surge, and he warned, "I advise you to surrender quickly. I've already notified the entire Outer Sect Disciple Squad when I came here. If you remain stubborn, then things won't be so simple." He continued, "You merely took some immature spiritual rice, which isn't a huge crime. If you're willing to cooperate, we will naturally consider a lighter punishment."
