# Chapter 87: Seeking a Path

The old man was stunned to have succeeded so easily. "I thought he was hiding his cultivation with some treasure. Never expected him to be a mere mortal. This is truly bizarre; how could a mortal appear in the God-Forsaken Land?"

The old man withdrew his short sword, gave it a gentle shake, and the bloodstains vanished. He then slipped it back into his sleeve. Still not giving up, he picked up the leaves on Zhou Tian's body and examined them carefully, only to find they were indeed ordinary leaves. He sighed, turned towards the large tree, and with a wave of his hand, the tree rustled, transforming into a verdant short staff that landed in his grasp. The village beneath the tree also vanished like a bubble. He took a single step, appearing a hundred miles away, and disappeared from the area.

Only Zhou Tian's corpse remained, along with a scattered plain robe. This robe wasn't any treasure, just ordinary clothes. Since it had just been stained with Zhou Tian's blood, the old man was too lazy to retrieve it.

Time passed quickly. This area was on the edge of the God-Forsaken Land, with very few people. After twelve hours, no one passed by. As soon as the reset time was up, Zhou Tian resurrected, reappearing at the location of his former corpse.

Speechless, unsure what to say, Zhou Tian sighed upon seeing the plain robe nearby and muttered softly, "At least he didn't take my clothes." Putting on the clothes, he finally didn't have to wander around in the wilderness with his bare butt exposed.

He looked up at the sun in the sky. In the God-Forsaken Land, day and night cycled roughly every 30 days, unlike Fudian State. According to the information Zhou Tian had found, the original Sun God and Moon God had been slain, and now the celestial bodies operated autonomously. It was unknown how such a unique day cycle had formed.

Choosing a random direction again, Zhou Tian teleported all the way. Although his "polite approach" had suffered a Waterloo, he had at least achieved one of his two goals: finding a set of clothes. That was something, he supposed, given the "simple folk customs" here. His other goal was to quickly figure out where the people from Jiuzhou were, what strange things had happened after his death that day, and whether Tianling and the others were alright. This was something he was very concerned about.

After teleporting for about three hours, Zhou Tian arrived at a place that resembled a major road. Although flying was not a difficult feat for cultivators, not everyone dared to fly through the void in the God-Forsaken Land. On one hand, some fierce beasts valued their territories greatly, and flying over their domains was considered a provocation. On the other hand, the God-Forsaken Land was a mix of dragons and snakes; you never knew if there was a terrifying old monster below you who might crush you with a single slap just because they disliked you flying over their head. Therefore, only those extremely confident in their own strength would typically fly through the air.

There was a single rut on this grand road, likely left by an extremely heavy object, as only something very heavy could leave such a mark on the remarkably solid ground of the God-Forsaken Land. Zhou Tian's eyes lit up upon seeing this rut. Since there were wheel tracks, following them in either direction would surely lead to signs of human habitation.

*Tap!*

His shoes landed. Zhou Tian put on his shoes and walked in the direction his toes had pointed. His teleportation distance had now reached 1000 meters, or one kilometer.

He moved quickly. In about half a day, Zhou Tian spotted signs of human activity, though it wasn't a settlement. It was a procession, approximately a hundred soldiers, all clad in bright silver armor and riding black single-horned warhorses. In the middle were two carriages, each pulled by four single-horned warhorses. One was a passenger carriage, white in color with white curtains, and a flower-like pattern carved on its walls. The other was a cargo carriage. The wheel tracks were left by this carriage. It was covered with white cloth, concealing whatever was inside, and the white cloth was embroidered with the same pattern as on the passenger carriage's walls.

Zhou Tian stopped a great distance away from them, hesitating for a long time. He had been thoroughly disgusted by that "simple" old man, wasting a whole day. What if he walked up to these soldiers and they stabbed him with a spear without a word? That would waste nearly another day.

As Zhou Tian was pondering, the white curtain of the passenger carriage was lifted, and a figure in a white robe emerged. It was a young woman, wearing a floral wreath on her head, with black hair reaching her waist. Her figure was obscured by the white robe, making it hard to discern, and while not exceedingly beautiful, she possessed an ethereal, unworldly aura. Zhou Tian, however, stared intently at the young woman's head wreath, feeling as if he had seen it somewhere before. After a moment, he suddenly blurted out, "Isn't that the flower wreath that birdman wore?"

Zhou Tian remembered: when they were ambushed, that "birdman" – whose name was almost identical to a certain angel from his previous life – had also worn this item. "So, they're followers of that birdman's divine system. I don't know what kind of divine system he belongs to, but from his appearance, he shouldn't be an evil deity. They probably won't just kill me on sight, right?" Zhou Tian pondered secretly. After all, the birdman, with his radiating light, couldn't possibly be part of some Cthulhu-like divine system, could he?

After mulling it over for a while, he decided to take a gamble. At worst, he'd just get killed again. However, he definitely couldn't chase them from behind, making it look like he was tracking them. Coincidentally, the young woman had stepped down from the carriage and was speaking to the leader of the procession. Zhou Tian's figure flickered repeatedly. He took a wide detour and circled around to wait ahead of them.

Their group wasn't moving very fast, mainly because the cargo carriage in the middle was extremely slow, which in turn slowed down the entire procession. Zhou Tian waited for quite a while before they finally reached his position. Seeing them approach, Zhou Tian quickly adopted the appearance of someone hurrying on their way. Hearing sounds behind him, he turned around, feigning delight, and stepped forward.

Upon closer observation, Zhou Tian realized that the leading soldier looked quite young, with golden hair and blue eyes, rather handsome, somewhat resembling a Westerner from his previous life. Seeing a stranger on the road, the soldier reined in his warhorse, signaled the team to halt, and raised his long spear. Milky white light extended from his palm.

"Halt! Who are you?" the captain-like figure pointed his spear at Zhou Tian and shouted.

"Gentlemen, I am Young Master Lian Jie of the Lian Family from Hammer City. I was out traveling and intended to seek lodging in a village, but unexpectedly, that village turned out to be an old monster's trap! My guards fought desperately to hold them back, allowing me to escape. If you can escort me back to my family, I will surely reward you generously!" Zhou Tian didn't even blink, speaking convincingly. His eyes were even a little red, and the hatred in his gaze was entirely genuine.

"Hammer City, Lian Family? Why have I never heard of them?" The captain's brow furrowed tightly. His long spear remained unmoving, pointed directly at Zhou Tian; any sudden movement from Zhou Tian would result in him being impaled.

"Never heard of them? How is that possible? My Hammer City is renowned, and my Lian Family is even noble... Wait... Where is this place?" Zhou Tian first wore an expression as if the captain were joking, then as if something had just occurred to him, he frowned and asked.
