# Chapter 33: The Hunt?

From the conversations of the diners, he learned that it was one of the famous taverns in Beiye City. Many nobles from the prefectural capital of Qingzhou would come specifically to taste the wild game there.

He didn't order anything too expensive, just home-style dishes, though the portions were large. Some dishes with rare mountain delicacies cost over a dozen taels of silver each, and the meal came to no less than a hundred taels.

During the meal, he saw many people dressed in fine clothes and ornate hats go up to the private rooms on the second floor. From the diners in the main hall on the first floor, he learned that the second floor was the playground for those high officials and wealthy individuals.

He needed to get some money.

Xu Yunfan touched the silver in his hand, let out a slight breath, and squinted his eyes, looking at the approaching nightfall.

The hunt?

A hunt was out of the question.

That night, in the east of Beiye City, the affluent residential area, there were many rich people, and just as many who were wealthy but unscrupulous.

At least while he was eating and drinking in the tavern, a few scholars at the next table, thoroughly drunk, loudly cursed the Hu family.

"The Hu family is truly wealthy but unscrupuous! With so many commoners frozen to death in the city, who knows how many behind the scenes are the Hu family's doing!"

The words echoed in the tavern, drawing glances from everyone, before they were quickly muffled by the scholars at the same table, who paid the bill and hurriedly left.

Although he didn't know if it was true, for the Hu family to be so vilified by scholars, their reputation was obviously terrible.

The Hu Family Manor.

Xu Yunfan stood in the shadows of a distant alley, quietly observing. He had inquired and learned that the Hu family had a martial arts instructor, who was considered a first-rate expert in this small city of Beiye.

The manor before him was built extremely lavishly. The tall, thick blue brick walls were over two people high, and the glazed tiles on the wall tops were covered in snow.

Xu Yunfan slowly paced around the manor, pretending to be a passerby. The surroundings were silent, with only the cold wind howling past.

The art of hunting allowed him to be extremely cautious and unnoticeable. After one round, almost no one察觉到了 him.

Sometimes, hunting animals or people is the same; this hunting skill is very useful.

After careful observation, he found that only the front and back gates had a few guards, all wrapped in thick cotton clothes, hunching their necks and occasionally stomping their feet to keep warm, with no mind to pay attention to their surroundings.

They could really only watch the gate.

Having made this judgment and confirmed the situation around him, Xu Yunfan came to a wall, took a deep breath, bent his legs slightly, and with a sudden burst of strength, performed a standing jump, leaping three meters high.

He reached out with one hand, steadily propped himself up on the wall, and moved as agilely as a night cat, silently climbing onto the roof built against the wall.

Only at this moment did Xu Yunfan feel that the Light Footwork skill, Flying Legs, was so useful in this environment. Combined with the special effects of Hunting, it was simply perfect.

The "body as light as a swallow, treading on danger as if on level ground" special effect from Flying Legs, paired with "silent footing" from Hunting, made his current weight of over two hundred catties feel as light as a feather, moving without making a sound.

He remained silent on the roof for a small half-hour, figuring out the patrol routes of the Hu family's night guards. Just as he was about to move, his action suddenly froze.

He saw a burly, middle-aged man slowly walking out from the inner courtyard. His face was weather-beaten, and a scar running from the corner of his eye diagonally across his cheek looked even more ferocious in the firelight.

Under his burly frame, he had broad shoulders and a narrow waist. The lines of his muscles were faintly visible under his brocade clothes. When he moved, his muscles bulged, full of explosive power. The knuckles of his hanging fingers were extremely large and distinct.

A martial arts instructor who had perfected muscle training, and an expert proficient in boxing techniques.

This must be the martial arts instructor of the Hu family.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes slightly, his breathing slowed by several points. An expert of this level is extremely sensitive to his environment; he could detect any slight movement.

Snowflakes slowly fell in the courtyard. The middle-aged man had his hands clasped behind his back, pacing around unhurriedly, then spoke in a leisurely voice.

"Come on out. It's not very appropriate to climb onto someone else's roof at night."

Xu Yunfan's heart trembled, but he didn't move, still hiding in the darkness, maintaining his dormant state. He was confident he had made no mistakes, and it was also possible the man was just bluffing. He had to stay calm.

Just then, his gaze suddenly shifted, looking towards the roof on the other side.

He saw a slender, dark figure suddenly dart out like a nimble civet cat. Her posture was as light as catkin, and in the blink of an eye, she was about to leap out of the courtyard.

"Trying to leave?"

The middle-aged man snorted coldly upon seeing this. He took a big step forward, his figure moving as fast as an arrow, instantly shooting out.

His speed was so fast that the wind whistled in his face as he moved, making the surrounding torches flicker violently.

In the blink of an eye, he had caught up to the slender figure who was about to jump out of the Hu manor.

The middle-aged man's arm shot out like lightning. A "whoosh" sound came from the air as his fist tore through it, letting out a sharp whistle. The force of the fist, carrying the momentum to split a monument and break stone, ruthlessly hammered towards the black-clothed woman.

This black-clothed woman was no ordinary person either. Seeing the situation, she stomped her foot fiercely, actually creating a shallow pit in the high wall.

Using this force, her figure was like a falcon soaring in the air. Her waist and abdomen twisted rapidly, and as one long leg exerted force, the muscles bulged under her tight black clothes. She kicked up swiftly, aiming straight for the middle-aged man's lower abdomen.

This concerned his family jewels, so the middle-aged man naturally didn't dare to be the slightest bit careless. He immediately retracted his hand to defend, but his goal was already achieved: he had blocked the black-clothed woman's path.

The two instantly fell into a fierce fight. Fists and feet came and went, and when they collided, they made a "whirring" sound. In a moment, they had exchanged over a dozen moves.

The middle-aged man's fists were heavy, each one possessing the strength of an ox. Although the woman was at a disadvantage in the exchange of blows, her body was like a civet cat, and her footwork was truly agile.

Finally, the black-clothed woman appeared to be outmatched, but in reality, she used the force of one of the middle-aged man's punches to quickly float backward, and in an instant, she landed outside the Hu manor.

Seeing this, the middle-aged man naturally wasn't willing to let it go. His face was filled with anger. This woman's attacks were vicious, each move aiming for vital points, and his lower body had been attacked several times in a row. His heart was naturally burning with rage, and he couldn't help but snort coldly.

"Where do you think you're going!"

With that, he leaped over the high wall and gave chase.

Xu Yunfan watched the two figures, one fleeing and one pursuing, and immediately realized this was a golden opportunity.

Right now, the entire Hu manor's attention was attracted by the black-clothed woman, and it was in chaos. It was the perfect time to fish in troubled waters.

Since someone was already there to take the blame, he no longer had any scruples.

Xu Yunfan quickly walked a circle on the roof of the Hu manor, but soon ran into a problem.

"Where the hell is the storeroom?"

Xu Yunfan's gaze settled. He looked down at a passing maid who looked terrified. His figure moved, and he landed in front of this pretty-faced maid.

This pretty young maid, because the Hu manor had been invaded by bandits, was walking timidly when a masked, burly man suddenly jumped out in front of her.

The burly man's eyes were like cold stars, staring intently at her.
