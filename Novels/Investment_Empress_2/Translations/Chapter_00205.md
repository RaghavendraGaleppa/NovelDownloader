# Chapter 205: Viewing the List at Dragon Gate, Uninvited Guests?

In the city, Li Mo didn't particularly like riding in carriages.

But as everyone knows, he and the Ice Cube are now quite famous.

If you randomly threw a brick in the city, you'd hit several passersby who have read *The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me*.

It's impossible to be known by name but not by face.

The day the Hidden Dragon List is unveiled will likely be even more bustling than the Martial Arts Summit. If he were recognized, it would be quite troublesome.

The carriage moved lightly.

The wind from Yulong Street brought in the noise from outside, allowing sunlight to spill into the carriage's interior.

Li Mo raised his eyes and saw Ying Bing sitting sideways, her long legs crossed.

Suddenly, her slender phoenix eyes narrowed slightly.

*Slap!*

The big-headed doll slapped a mosquito onto the table.

Ying Bing frowned slightly, casually picked up a rag, and began wiping the big-headed doll's forehead, scrubbing it with a squeaky sound.

Only after it was polished to a shine did a hint of pleasure flash in her eyes.

Li Mo: "....."

Was this doll really not related to witchcraft or voodoo?

Why did he feel a chill on his forehead...?

Beside him, Princess Jiang Chulong was also carefully wiping the broken sword she had picked up three days ago, her face full of seriousness.

"Weren't you planning to sell that as scrap?"

Li Mo smiled and asked casually, "If you're going to sell it, why clean it so thoroughly?"

"This... this... I'm not selling them. They aren't... aren't scrap... They were... bought for me by Big Brother Li..."

After shaking her head, Jiang Chulong blinked.

"And... they're still... still alive..."

"Huh?"

Li Mo was taken aback.

He had indeed been receiving system feedback these past few days.

It was the martial arts insights feedback from Princess Jiang Chulong, such as: [Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'Jiang Chulong,' helping her comprehend a sword art and promoting the growth of the Wild Grass Sword Bone.]

So... that's how it happened?

From the tattered and incomplete swords, she had领悟ed a sword art?

"...."

Li Mo slapped the Chixiao Sword.

As a high-grade Spirit Weapon, and a complete one at that, why couldn't you give me some face?

Suddenly, Li Mo remembered something.

"By the way, Ice Cube."

Ying Bing raised her eyes. "Hmm?"

"Have you encountered any difficulties during your lectures these past few days?"

"For example?"

Li Mo asked, "Many disciples of the Hengyun Sword City practice different sword arts. What if they ask you about a sword art you haven't接触ed?"

"What difference does it make whether I've practiced a sword art or not, if it's below the level of a Divine Art?"

"....."

Li Mo understood.

She meant she could learn it on the spot.

There was confusion in her beautiful phoenix eyes, as if wondering why he would ask such a question, as if the look said:

'Aren't you the same?'

Looking at the confusion on her serene, jade-like face, and the bewilderment in the other pair of gray-white eyes, Little Li fell silent.

If the Chixiao Sword could talk right now, it would definitely be slapping the table and saying, "Little Li, say something!"

.....

Not long after, the carriage slowly arrived at the end of Yulong Street, where it faced the shimmering Dragon Gate Lake.

Every major city at the state level would have a Dragon Gate set up within the city to公布 the Hidden Dragon List.

Looking out, one could see the Dragon Gate standing on the lake, towering six or seven stories high. It was pure white, carved with intricate seal script, looking as if it were made of white marble.

Li Mo and his martial brothers from the Clear Abyss Sect got off the carriage and chose a prime viewing spot at a tavern.

"Shopkeeper, you don't even have any customers here. You can't be fully booked."

"My apologies, honorable guest. A wealthy patron from the Eastern Wilderness Region has booked the entire place..."

The shopkeeper shook his head and cupped his hands.

"We in the business value integrity above all."

Li Mo pondered for a moment.

"Is your tavern for sale?"

There were four golden mountains left in his system space—originally five, but one was used for investment three days ago.

He had even more silver notes.

As for rare treasures, he couldn't be bothered to count them, nor did he know their exact values.

A chest was slapped onto the ground.

"This tavern of mine is in a prime location. Not to mention the land being worth its weight in gold, just the construction cost thirty thousand taels of silver. Young hero, you恐怕 are..."

"This isn't silver."

"A chest of gold? That's about..."

"Silver notes."

*Slap—Slap—Slap—*

---

The shopkeeper and the waiter's knees went weak.

Why were there three sounds?

Li Mo: "..... Senior Brother Ouyang, we're in this together."

.....

On the open-air banquet hall on the top floor.

Everyone took their seats. Li Mo had the Ice Cube and Princess Jiang Chulong on his left and right, facing the Dragon Gate directly ahead.

This was essentially the VIP best-viewing area.

"It's really lively."

Li Mo looked down at the sea of people below.

"Of course. After all, the Hidden Dragon List is much closer to the common people than the Heaven, Earth, and Human Lists."

"The Hidden Dragon List is one of the most eye-catching lists."

Ying Bing's eyes reflected the Dragon Gate.

In this lifetime, she would be登上 the Hidden Dragon List much earlier...

Li Mo took a sip of tea and placed an apple in Princess Jiang Chulong's hand.

That made sense.

An Eighth Realm expert goes without saying, like a divine dragon, seen only by its head, not its tail.

Whether it's the Seventh Realm Profound Master on the Heaven List or the Fifth Realm Outer Scene on the Human List, they are too distant for ordinary martial artists.

The Hidden Dragon List consists of those at the Divine Perception Realm, which at least one could possibly reach.

"Wait, 'one of'?"

"There's also the Hundred Flowers List and the Divine Weapon List."

The waiter beside them suddenly spoke up, smiling broadly. "Looking at your distinguished auras, you might have several young prodigies who will make the Hidden Dragon List!"

"The Hidden Dragon List..."

Looking at the commotion below, Li Mo suddenly felt a sense of unreality.

Could he make the Hidden Dragon List?

If it were based on true strength, then undoubtedly, yes.

He might even rank quite high.

Although he was only at the Second窍 of the Divine Perception Realm, he possessed far too many assets that a Divine Perception cultivator shouldn't have.

He clearly remembered the memories brought by the confusion of the womb.

He was just an ordinary, insignificant person from society. His looks were average, his grades were average, his salary after graduation was average. He would occasionally claim that the reason he hadn't dated was because he was selective, but in reality, no one was interested...

Now, his name might appear before the eyes of the world?

It still didn't feel quite real...

Of course, it wasn't certain.

"I wonder how reliable this Hidden Dragon List is."

Li Mo retracted his thoughts.

"Eight or nine times out of ten."

"The Celestial Derivation Sect has existed for a very long time, longer than the Great Yu Dynasty, even longer than the Great Shang Dynasty."

Ying Bing said softly.

How did she know that divination techniques truly existed in the world?

It was precisely because of the various Nine Heavens Ten Lands Power Lists published by the Celestial Derivation Sect.

Even their assessment of her was quite accurate.

"Then I'll wait and see."

Li Mo smiled. In fact, he wasn't confident.

The Eye of Fate couldn't see his destiny, so it was hard to say about the Celestial Derivation Sect.

It might not be accurate.

"Mm..."

Ying Bing remembered the woman who had read Li Mo's face three days ago.

She had recognized her as the current Celestial Derivation Sect's Walker—Tian Miao.

Tian Miao personally came to read his face, so it should... have some reference value?

Four days.

There were only four days left until the system would rank him.

Perhaps this Hidden Dragon List ranking could, to some extent, correspond to the system's ranking?

Ying Bing withdrew her gaze from him and looked towards the Dragon Gate.

*Bang—*

Just at that moment, the waiter from earlier burst in.

The waiter said with a long face, "Young hero, the guests who booked the place earlier have come. They insist on speaking with the tavern owner."

"Then let them find the owner."

"But you are the owner now..."

"Uh... In that case, return their money and give those几位 a good seat..."

As Li Mo was speaking.

Footsteps sounded at the staircase, and it wasn't just one person.

"The locals in Yunzhou are so rude. How dare they snatch the seat I reserved!"

The voice seemed...

Quite familiar?

PS: Typos will be corrected later.

Today, I rode my electric scooter to the internet cafe to write, but it ran out of power halfway, and I had to push it for a long time.

Little Pa Street (the author) thought to himself, if only some readers would give me some power (donate) right now, T-T.
