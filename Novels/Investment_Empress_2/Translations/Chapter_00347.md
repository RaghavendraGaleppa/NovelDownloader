# Chapter 347: What Era Is It, Still Acting Like a Traditional God?

The rain kept falling, and the atmosphere was a little awkward.

Li Mo maintained his original posture, but nothing happened.

The fat priest hurriedly picked up the bronze staff on the ground, pointed at Li Mo, and said with feigned courage, "You charlatan! Your trick has been exposed!"

Li Mo thought for a moment.

If it were the Ice Cube, what would she do in this situation?

Hmm, probably nothing, just ignore him completely.

So, the Heavenly尊 (Lord) didn't pay him any mind, not even giving him a single glance. The effect was immediate.

It made the fat priest look even more like a clown, jumping around in a frenzy.

The townspeople whispered among themselves. Some vaguely guessed what this mysterious immortal wanted to do.

Could it be that he wanted to casually point a finger and move the mountain blocking their town away?

The old chief stood in the heavy rain, his eyes shining with light. In the past, even with the so-called Witch Spirit's protection, they had to take a very long detour to reach the outside world.

If the mountain in front of them was gone, wouldn't they have an unobstructed path from now on?

At least, there would be no more obstacles in one direction!

This hope rose in his heart, but his reason told him that such a thing was impossible...

But just at that moment.

The ground suddenly trembled slightly.

"Rumble—"

Followed by a violent earthquake!

The old chief and the crowd of townspeople couldn't stand steady and all fell to the ground, but they stared intently at the distance.

"The mountain is moving! The Eastern Mountain is moving!"

"Now we can go east without having to take a detour!"

"From now on, we don't need a god's protection to leave these mountains!"

"Heavenly尊 Lord!"

The rain stopped.

The door to the outside world was slowly opening for the Three Mountain Town.

A ray of dawn fell, illuminating the figure of the calm and composed young man. It seemed to coat every inch of him in a light called hope.

At this moment, countless townspeople widened their eyes, the gloom within them dispelled by that figure.

"It's over."

The fat priest fell to the ground, his face pale with despair.

"I'm the fake one."

The other party might not necessarily be a real god.

As a disciple of the Demon Summoning Sect, he had been in the Southern Frontier for a long time and knew a thing or two about the demon race. He had already realized that the other party was likely a high-level demon.

Otherwise, it would be impossible to command the wind and rain or move mountains.

The other party was clearly well-prepared!

Unless the main headquarters sent an expert, there would be no one capable of contending with him.

He was thinking of taking advantage of the moment when no one else had reacted to slip away quietly.

"Hmph~ Trying to escape~~~?"

A sharp, electronic voice suddenly rang out from behind. Manbo rubbed his palms together, then pulled up an arc of electricity and shot it at the fat priest.

The electric snake danced wildly, its speed too fast for the naked eye to follow, and it struck him right in his tattered pants.

Manbo was a Great Demon, two whole realms above the Divine Observation Realm.

Sizzle—

The fat priest was instantly electrocuted into a frantic dance, his whole body blackened and convulsing. Even if he were cured in the future, he'd probably be drooling.

Seeing this, Li Mo gave Manbo a satisfied, grateful look.

Senior Manbo knew how to improvise perfectly. He deserved an extra chicken leg.

He hadn't wanted to let the fat priest escape either, but to take him down instantly, he would have had to pull out his hammer.

But if he had pulled out the hammer, wouldn't all his previous acting have been for nothing? The dignity of the Heavenly尊 would have been shattered on the ground.

"Heavenly尊 Lord!"

At this moment, the old chief shouted loudly and took the lead in kneeling before the altar.

The townspeople already regarded Li Mo with godlike reverence and followed, kneeling all over the ground.

Li Mo's lips moved, but this time, he ultimately didn't say the words, "Do not kneel."

For the townspeople, the so-called god they had worshipped before was merely a vague entity that offered some protection when they walked through the forests.

In their eyes, Li Mo had physically moved a mountain. Who was real and who was fake was clear as day.

But the townspeople had never imagined that there are no gods in this world to begin with.

Li Mo raised his hands slightly and said, "Now that this matter is settled, I must take my leave."

"You... you are leaving?"

The old chief looked up abruptly but didn't dare to stand up.

---

"Are you angry that we worshipped a false god? I will immediately have the clan elders and I topple the false god's statue and enshrine yours instead." He gritted his teeth. "The offerings... the offerings will definitely be more generous than in previous years!"

The mountain was gone. Going east would be ten times more convenient from now on. If they gritted their teeth, they could probably gather more offerings.

Li Mo looked at the townspeople kneeling on the ground, trembling, afraid that he would never descend again. His gaze was complex.

"Are you truly sincere in wanting to worship me?"

"Of course!"

"But I do not want common offerings like pigs, sheep, and fruits. Those are meaningless to me."

"Not common offerings..."

The old chief's expression changed, and his body trembled.

Could it be... he wants human sacrifices?

Originally, the town held a grand ceremony once a year. Families with children would draw lots to select young boys and girls.

The population of Three Mountain Town was not prosperous to begin with...

But other towns and villages all had the protection of gods, whether real or fake, they at least had something. If this Heavenly尊 were to leave, what would the town do in the future?

He was struggling internally, about to grit his teeth and agree.

But another sentence drifted down from above.

"I want the stones from the mountains, a great many mountain stones."

"Huh?"

Everyone was confused.

Li Mo said expressionlessly, "Including the mountain I just moved, these three mountains are beings that have absorbed the essence of the sun and moon and have existed for billions of years in this world. You have mortal eyes and cannot see their spiritual nature."

"You say you are sincere?"

"In that case, then hollow out the remaining two mountains as offerings to me."

"This... these two great mountains, how could we possibly hollow them out..."

The old chief had a bitter expression. How could they possess such an ability?

"If you cannot hollow them out, then let your sons and grandsons, generation after generation, continue digging."

"Every year, you must fill this temple, then I will believe in your sincerity."

Fill the temple?

That wouldn't be too much, but it would take countless years to do.

The young men in the town looked at the size of the temple and silently calculated in their hearts.

"Chief Grandpa, we can do it!"

"Yeah, we have nothing else, but we have strength!"

"At least now it's much more convenient to go east to trade for grain. Digging stones is better than worrying about starving to death before."

Hearing the chorus of young voices, the old chief nodded heavily.

He was about to turn back and tell the Heavenly尊 Lord that they were willing to dig the mountains, but a white cloud had already flown high into the sky.

Only two booklets were left on the ground.

The old chief curiously stepped forward and picked them up, asking the town's literate schoolteacher, "What does this say?"

"One is called 'Mountain Hacking Hammer Technique'! The other is called 'Second Set... Broadcast Calisthenics'?"

"These seem to be two martial arts techniques, and they are even labeled as 'Superior Grade'! They must be extraordinary!"

"The Heavenly尊 Lord's meaning, is he perhaps asking us to select strong young men to practice these, so we can mine more mountain stones for him?"

"That must be it!"

"What does it say at the back?"

"Those who help themselves, the heavens help them!"

"You mean if we work harder, the Heavenly尊 Lord will continue to help us?"

...

On the white cloud.

Shang Qinqing looked at the cheering townspeople below and pondered, "Did you create those two martial arts techniques yourself?"

"Yep."

Li Mo nodded.

He didn't use any martial arts comprehension for the hammer technique, but he did use some for the broadcast calisthenics, modifying a basic martial art.

Truly worthy of being the Divine Hammer Little Overlord!

Ling Yuan'gou clicked his tongue. "Tsk tsk, giving away martial arts in exchange for stones. What kind of good deed is this? It doesn't look like something a god would do."

"What era is it, still acting like a traditional god?"

"But you need a lot of faith power. Aren't you afraid that after they learn martial arts and hollow out the mountains, they'll stop revering you as a god?"

"That would be fantastic."

Li Mo rubbed his face, breaking his cold and aloof expression, and touched the scorching Clear Sky Multicolored Pagoda.

"Acting like an immortal is so exhausting. Did you guys bring any vinegar? I still have some dumplings left..."
