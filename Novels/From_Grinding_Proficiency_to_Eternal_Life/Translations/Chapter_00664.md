# Chapter 664: Through Countless Dangers, the Golden Core True Lord is Finally Formed

The words of Qingyuan True Lord failed to stir even a single ripple in Xu Yunfan’s heart.

The calculations and favors of the past, at this critical juncture of proving the Golden Core and settling karmic ties, were nothing more than a gentle breeze brushing against his face.

Kill.

Eradicate the threat for good.

This was the only optimal solution derived by the absolute rationality of the Lin State.

Xu Yunfan formed a sword with his fingers, drawing upon the boundless stellar power of the Zhouhe Star Constellation Array to empower the final, majestic Heavenly Thunder of Divine Skies to Break Evil.

The purple-gold pillar of lightning instantly expanded tenfold.

Wherever it passed, the heavens and earth lost their color, and all things were shattered inch by inch.

“No!!!”

Qingyuan True Lord let out a desperate and unwilling roar, mobilizing his lifelong cultivation to condense the core of the Immortal Palace’s clear qi manifested by his Dao Fruit, transforming it into an ancient, profound Stele of the Heavenly Dao to meet the attack.

**BOOM!!!**

An indescribable, terrifying explosion erupted over the Eastern Wasteland.

The purple-gold lightning and the clear, misty immortal qi violently annihilated each other, like the collision of two small worlds.

The shockwave swept through the eight desolations and six directions, plowing the already shattered Eastern Wasteland flat for ten thousand miles once more.

The light faded.

The figure of the True Lord of Qingyuan’s Mysterious Way, Bearing Fortune and Responding to the Heavenly Dao, had vanished.

In its place remained only a wisp of damaged, nearly dissipated True Spirit origin, and the shadow of the Qingyuan Mysterious Way, Bearing Fortune and Responding to the Heavenly Dao Fruit, riddled with cracks and dimming to the extreme, slowly floating and sinking amidst the starlight of the constellation array.

Xu Yunfan’s spiritual sense, like a glacial river pouring forth, instantly locked onto that wisp of True Spirit.

The Ethereal Soul Banner’s dark light swirled, ready to draw it in along with the remnant Dao Fruit shadow, refining it into the fourth Golden Core Banner Spirit.

However, just as the Ethereal Soul Banner was about to touch that wisp of True Spirit—

A gaze from high above the nine heavens crossed an endless distance, casting its sight upon this place.

This gaze came from the Origin Sect’s True Lord of the Nine Heavens, Qingyuan, Responding to Thunder, Manifesting Transformation, Mysterious Existence, and Universal Salvation!

A top expert of the mid-Golden Core realm.

The gaze held no direct intent to attack, only a warning and a sense of oppression.

Naturally, he was reminding Xu Yunfan that mutual destruction within the same sect had already crossed a line. To completely annihilate a True Lord’s True Spirit and seize the foundation of his Dao Fruit, however, touched upon the bottom line of the Origin Sect.

In the Lin State, Xu Yunfan’s thoughts were like lightning, instantly completing countless calculations and weighing of options.

Forcibly taking him would immediately trigger a direct conflict with the True Lord of Universal Salvation.

The True Lord of Universal Salvation’s cultivation was unfathomable, far surpassing Qingyuan’s.

At this moment, the time remaining for him to temporarily hold the Golden Core position was almost gone. He had not yet truly proven the Divine Skies Dao Fruit. If he were to forcefully fight him, the odds of victory were slim. It was highly likely he would fail in the end, his body and spirit destroyed.

If he gave up, Qingyuan’s True Spirit was already severely injured, and his Dao Fruit was on the verge of shattering. Even if he were to reincarnate, the difficulty of regathering his True Spirit, condensing an immortal Golden nature once more, and finding a Dao Fruit compatible enough to reascend to the Golden Core realm would be akin to climbing to the heavens.

His path to the Dao would be almost completely cut off.

Later, once Xu Yunfan had stabilized his own Golden Core realm, he could find an opportunity to settle this karma completely. The risks and costs would be much lower.

Avoiding a conflict with the True Lord of Universal Salvation and ensuring the success of his own Dao-proving was the optimal choice for the moment.

In the Lin State, the conclusion was instantly determined.

Xu Yunfan controlled the Ethereal Soul Banner’s dark light, which suddenly halted, shifting away at the last possible moment. He allowed that wisp of damaged True Spirit, carrying the nearly shattered Dao Fruit shadow, to be guided by the laws of reincarnation, transforming into a dim streak of light that plunged into the unknowable depths of the Six Paths of Reincarnation.

“Go to reincarnation. To enter the Golden Core realm again will be a thousand difficulties and ten thousand hardships. Once my Golden Core is stable, I will surely come to settle this with you.”

This scene naturally made the True Lord of Universal Salvation nod inwardly. Xu Yunfan was still sensible, and as someone from the Origin Sect, he knew how to read the situation.

Feeling the gaze of the True Lord of Universal Salvation dissipate and confirming that no further threats existed, Xu Yunfan’s mind moved.

The glacial ice that had frozen his eyes for ten thousand years instantly melted, and the brilliance of his humanity reignited.

The aura of a Golden Core, forcibly raised to shake the heavens and earth, receded from his body like a tidal wave. The power of temporarily holding the Golden Core position completely vanished. The last essence of the Taiyin Mirror Dao Fruit turned into specks of cold, clear light, returning to nothingness.

Inside him, the nascent form of a Small World, long since coiled by ninety-nine紫金 (Purple-Gold) Divine Dragons and accumulating boundless power, along with the condensed and materialized Dao Foundation of the Purple宸 (Zichen) Zhouhe Myriad Transformation Thunder Palace, now faced no more obstacles and shook violently.

It pulled upon the resplendent Dao Fruit suspended above his head, composed of countless thunder law runes.

The Dao Fruit of the Divine Skies, Jade Clarity, Nine Palaces, Purple宸, Heavenly Dome, Myriad Transformation, and Immortality!

“The Heavenly Dome is immortal, Divine Skies governs punishment! Dao Fruit, return to your place!”

Xu Yunfan’s voice echoed through the heavens and earth, carrying the great ambition to break through the mists of ages and ascend to the ultimate peak, as well as the invincible momentum forged through successive battles and overcoming the human tribulation.

**BOOM!**

The thunder world’s nascent form, transformed from the Purple宸 Zhouhe Myriad Transformation Thunder Palace Dao Foundation, turned into a pillar of purple-gold light that pierced the heavens and earth, and fiercely crashed into the core of the Divine Skies Dao Fruit.

In an instant, the heavens and earth lost all sound.

All thunder, all light, all sound, seemed to be devoured by the point of impact.

The next moment, a brilliance that could not be described in words erupted from that single point, instantly flooding the entire Eastern Wasteland.

A vast aura of shattering all laws, carrying the heavens and earth, and being eternally immortal, like the first ray of light at the creation of the world, swept across the entire Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

At the core of that endless divine light, a resplendent Golden Core, coiled by ninety-nine Purple-Gold Divine Dragons and containing the nascent form of an endless thunder world, slowly condensed, solidified, and finally took complete form.

It was like a newly born thunder star. The light and pressure it emitted announced the birth of a new Supreme True Lord!

The Dao Fruit of the Divine Skies, Jade Clarity, Nine Palaces, Purple宸, Heavenly Dome, Myriad Transformation, and Immortality, completely merged with him.

The True Lord of Divine Skies, Nine Palaces, and Heavenly Dome, is complete!

The Golden Core realm, achieved!

On the ruins of the Eastern Wasteland, Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes. Within them, purple-gold thunder light was contained, as if hiding within them the birth and destruction of countless small thunder worlds.

He gently raised his hand, feeling the unprecedented, boundless power within his body—as if he could control all the thunders of the heavens and shatter myriad worlds—and the eternal Dao rhyme that coexisted with the Dao, the immortality of the Heavenly Dome.

Lu Chunyang of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect gazed at the newly born thunder star, a genuine smile curling at the corner of his mouth.

“Excellent! The Divine Skies Dao Fruit has appeared once more. This child has truly succeeded!”

At the Origin Sect, the True Lord of Universal Salvation’s eyes flashed with a complex light, finally turning into an inscrutable, low sigh.

“True Lord of Divine Skies, Xu Yunfan. The Origin Sect is likely to become even more lively. It’s a pity about Qingyuan.”

The True Lord of Universal Salvation shook his head slightly, and his figure, like a gentle breeze, dissipated and merged into the heavens and earth.

At the Bodhi Pure Land, the Great Awakening Bodhisattva clasped his hands together, lowly chanting a Buddhist name. His golden body’s majestic appearance remained solemn, but a hint of worry flashed through the depths of his eyes.

As one wanes, the other waxes. The Bodhi Pure Land has truly suffered a great loss this time.

Above the Eastern Wasteland.

The Ethereal Soul Banner’s dark light retracted, quietly hovering by Xu Yunfan’s side. The three Golden Core Banner Spirits within were silent, awaiting the will of their new master.

Xu Yunfan stood at the peak of the ruins, sensing the power of commanding all the thunders of the heavens and earth that now belonged to him.

A thought arises, and billions of thunders are born.

A thought falls, and boundless thunders can strike.

It is no wonder this Dao Fruit ranks among the top ten of the 108 Heavenly Generals and Earthly Fiend Dao Fruits.

Compared in this way, it is no less than that of the sword cultivator, perhaps even superior.

In this broken place, he finally has the power to protect himself, the ability to sit at the table.

His gaze calmly swept over the messy battlefield, finally landing on the direction where the reincarnation had vanished, his eyes as deep as an abyss.

The tribulation of Qingyuan is over. The path of the True Lord of Divine Skies begins from here.
