# Chapter 124: Ying Bing: "Is it delicious?"

**Dongli Village.**

**Inside the residence.**

The youth silently opened his eyes. The almost tangible light of fire within him slowly subsided.

The Clear Edge Sect disciples living nearby all felt the scorching heat to varying degrees.

However, before they could sense it clearly, the heat vanished without a trace, as if it were an illusion.

"The embryonic form of the Xuan Dan."

Li Mo let out a small breath.

What a pity.

By the middle of last night, the small bottle of accumulated Golden Crow Blood had been completely used up.

The effects of other rare treasures were far inferior; otherwise, he wouldn't have had to stop halfway through condensing his Xuan Dan.

"Under the heavens, whose Xuan Dan is as difficult to condense as mine?"

Li Mo sighed.

Actually, his progress speed was already enough to make most Internal Qi martial artists exclaim that he was a monster.

But one had to look at his consumption.

Just one drop of Golden Crow Blood was enough to make an ordinary Internal Qi martial artist skyrocket in cultivation.

Yet after drinking a whole small bottle, his Xuan Dan still hadn't appeared.

If he relied on his own grinding efforts to break through, it would take an unknown amount of time.

"I hope the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm can bring me a little surprise."

Li Mo touched the booklet in his chest and walked out of the room.

He walked to the隔壁 room and stopped.

He felt a pressure—noble and peerless, like a deity.

"The Ice Cube has also made considerable progress."

...

**Inside the room.**

The True Phoenix Plume hovered in front of her chest, shimmering slightly. It seemed to resonate with the divine patterns between the少女's eyebrows, and two streams of Internal Qi entangled, sweeping in all directions.

Ying Bing appeared even more sacred and inviolable.

"I've finally regained control of the True Phoenix Transformation."

She furrowed her brows slightly and took the plume.

Along the way, she had been comprehending the power within the True Phoenix Plume.

This was no longer a martial art; it could be called a divine ability.

With the True Phoenix Plume protecting her body, her Xiahuang Qi and physique were further enhanced, becoming twenty to thirty percent stronger than what had been tempered by the power of Taiyin in the past.

She could now also initially utilize the few martial arts she had prided herself on in her previous life.

If she had more Blood Phoenix Essence...

In the current Central Divine Continent, she would have the confidence to be the undisputed number one.

The next ranking list would be out in ten days.

"This time..."

Ying Bing slowly stood up. Her entire body seemed to be draped in brilliant phoenix feathers, noble and mysterious. With a slight movement of her three thousand black hairs, a hazy radiance was born.

It gave the illusion that an ancient True Phoenix had descended, transforming into a goddess.

She would win.

Her Xiahuang Qi wrapped around the popsicles at the corner of the wall, and she pushed the door open.

"...Did you add special effects?"

Little Li was a bit confused.

*What the heck.*

After the Ice Cube finished practicing, why does it look like she manually added a million-dollar special effect?

Li Mo took a long time to recover.

He was thinking.

Why can the Ice Cube be both strong and beautiful?

Why can he only choose one?

"Ice pop."

A slender hand picked up a SpongeBob and placed it in his hand.

"Ooh, ooh."

Li Mo originally wanted to eat a Patrick; he liked watermelon flavor.

After taking a lick, he found something was off.

Huh?

Why does this ice pop taste so good?

Moreover...

After finishing that lick, his Dantian felt like it had encountered sweet dew, boiling with joy. Even his Xuan Dan seemed to have solidified a bit.

"What did you make this SpongeBob out of?"

"Emperor Flow Nectar."

Ying Bing tucked a strand of black hair behind her ear and gently picked up a Patrick.

"......"

Li Mo was speechless for a moment.

"Is it delicious?"

"......" Little Li didn't know what to say.

Ying Bing raised her eyes and looked at him seriously. The morning light spilled into her pupils, which were still tinged with divine brilliance, creating a beauty too dazzling to look at directly.

She repeated:

"Is it delicious?"

"....."

Li Mo's feelings were complicated:

"It's delicious, thanks."

"Mm."

---

Only then did Ying Bing pick up a Patrick and gently lick it twice.

How to put it.

Her cold and sacred demeanor, with her jade-like lips slightly parted, licking the popsicle seriously—it was quite a contrast.

Little Li's feelings were quite complicated.

The two stood like this, not speaking, leaning against the corridor and eating their popsicles.

A long while later.

A cautious voice came from behind.

"I say, I might have come at the wrong time."

Old Xiao's mouth twitched:

"But we really should get going now."

A short while later.

The three arrived at the entrance of Dongli Village.

Xue Jing distributed some pills to everyone, including antidotes and healing medicines.

Yin Huaxuan's complexion was much gloomier than before, but he still fulfilled his duties, telling everyone about the types of strange beasts they might encounter after entering the secret realm.

Qian Bufan stepped forward, gave some precautions, and encouraged everyone to help each other in the secret realm.

Indeed.

The Blood Phoenix Secret Realm was not a benevolent place.

It not only contained the inherent dangers of the secret realm itself but also the human hearts that needed constant vigilance—the latter was even more terrifying.

After all, inside the secret realm, no one cared about your background. If you killed someone, they were dead, and it was extremely difficult to trace.

Therefore, the disciples could only rely on each other.

Li Mo's "Yes" was answered particularly loudly.

After preparations were done.

Qian Bufan summoned a war chariot from his spatial object, telling everyone to get on.

This war chariot consumed a great deal, but its momentum was formidable, enough to deter some minor villains.

...

In an instant, ten minutes passed.

The massive war chariot arrived before Red Maple Mountain.

At this moment, the mountain was filled with shadows of people, bustling with activity. The Clear Edge Sect was considered to have arrived relatively late.

Ying Bing stood holding her sword, attracting countless gazes.

Meanwhile, Li Mo activated his Destiny Divine Eye. Looking around, streams of information flowed through his eyes.

He recorded them while feeling somewhat strange.

There was still no one named Han Zhen.

The secret realm was about to open; those who were supposed to come should have arrived.

If Han Zhen wanted to enter the secret realm, he should be here now.

But.

If he didn't enter the secret realm, why did the Ice Cube tell him to be careful of him?

It was very strange.

"Hu... Blood Phoenix Secret Realm."

"I hope I can break through to the Jade Liquid Realm this time!"

Xiao Qin clenched his fists and cheered himself on.

"Forget about the Blood Phoenix Soul, if you can find a few accompanying spiritual items, that would be a huge opportunity,"

The Thousand Form Martial Master laughed in his mind.

"Master, I will definitely find the Phoenix Blood Spirit Grass for you!"

Xiao Qin's eyes burned with determination.

The Phoenix Blood Spirit Grass was the key item for his master to reforge his body. If other rare treasures were used as substitutes, the effect would be much worse.

This spiritual grass only exists in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm. If this opportunity is missed, it's unknown when the next one will be.

"It's good to have that intention. Your strength in the secret realm can only be considered lower-tier,"

The Thousand Form Martial Master's tone was complex. He longed for the Phoenix Blood Spirit Grass but feared his disciple would take risks.

After a moment of contemplation, he said:

"If you have the chance, follow Li Mo. It will be much safer, and you might also gain a bit more."

"Okay!"

Xiao Qin nodded vigorously.

He was tenacious in character, not stupid.

Why not hug a big thigh if there's one?

A stick of incense later.

*Boom—*

It was the sound of the stone gate opening, accompanied by a phoenix cry that pierced through metal and stone, echoing through the nine heavens.

The entire mountain peak seemed to tremble.

At a bird-beak-like cave in Red Maple Mountain, a妖冶 red light was now emanating.

Countless people looked over immediately, their faces filled with fervor.

The secret realm had opened!

Everyone had the chance to obtain an opportunity, rise to prominence, and write their own legend in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Even Ying Bing's gaze became serious.

"Hu..."

"A big project."

Little Li stretched his body.

He had only one thought in his mind.

After collecting investment targets for so long, it was finally time to get to work.

Of course, the main focus was still the Ice Cube.

He activated his Destiny Divine Eye one last time, looking at Ying Bing.
