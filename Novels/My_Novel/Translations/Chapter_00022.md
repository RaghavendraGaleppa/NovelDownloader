# Chapter 22: Great Improvement in Strength, the Four Directions Fist Force

Luo Fang pressed, "I see that Protector Li still seems to have some energy left. Why don't you give me some guidance?"

Li Xian said calmly, "Manager Luo, I advise you to check the time. Don't forget your duties."

Only a fool would try to be brave.

If I don't fight you, what can you do? Li Xian crossed his arms and took a small step back.

Luo Fang was stunned, only then realizing that he had been blinded by anger and completely forgotten about his main business.

As a servant manager, instead of doing his proper work, he went looking for a protector for a sparring match. If this got out, the Madam would certainly be furious.

He let out a cold snort, called to the servants, and continued to transport the wood and stone. All his anger could only be vented on the servants.

"Brother Li, not bad! That Four Directions Fist of yours is very proficient," Zhao Dachun praised with a smile, giving a thumbs up.

"Just average, just average."

Li Xian smiled modestly and found a spot with a wide view.

He could both practice his fist and keep a watch. He immediately assumed a fist stance and began practicing.

"So diligent. I wonder if this kid can push himself a bit further. If he becomes a Grade C protector, his days would be much more comfortable," Zhao Dachun glanced over and didn't go to disturb him.

\[Your mind is clear, your fist intent has greatly increased, Proficiency +4\]

\[Heaven rewards diligence; having thrown tens of thousands of punches, your movements are as smooth as flowing clouds and water, Proficiency +2\]

\[You are persistent and have not wasted a single day, Proficiency +4\]

For the next several hours in the afternoon, Li Xian rested for at most a quarter of an hour. All the other time was spent refining the Four Directions Fist.

Bi Hao, who had been beaten into serious injury and could only lie on the ground, saw Li Xian practicing tirelessly and felt an inexpressible despair. Someone more talented than you is also working harder than you.

How can you even hope for a comeback?

"You good-for-nothing. If I had known, I would have cultivated him back then. You are just hopeless mud."

Comparing the two, a hint of regret arose in Luo Fang's heart.

"A martial artist views the human body as a clay figure. Post-natal martial arts training is for the purpose of transforming this clay figure."

"Commander Pang said that martial artists... whether they have already undergone a complete transformation or are still struggling in the clay figure and the muddy world, can be summarized in four characters: eating, training, nurturing, and soaking."

"Right now, 'training' is the only thing I can control, and I must do it to the extreme!"

Li Xian threw a punch, feeling his own progress.

Nightfall.

Li Xian dragged his exhausted body back to the room. The room was already dark, with the lights extinguished. There seemed to be the sound of snoring.

"It seems I'm much better today, going to sleep so early. I still have the night patrol shift, I should rest quickly too."

Li Xian moved lightly, unbuckling the long knife at his waist. As he placed it on the table, he noticed the candle still had some residual warmth.

It seemed to have been blown out not long ago.

"So it's not that they went to sleep early, but that they saw me coming back and deliberately blew out the candle."

"Jiang Yun's move was too vicious. It's normal for there to be a psychological barrier."

Li Xian saw through it but didn't say anything. He lay down on his bed and closed his eyes. At the Chou hour (1-3 AM) in the middle of the night, he went out on patrol for an hour, and nothing unusual happened.

He returned to the room and caught up on some more sleep, getting up again at the Mao hour (5-7 AM) to prepare for the morning training.

"This daily routine is very taxing on one's will. If there's a chance, I must quickly advance to a Grade C protector," Li Xian made a firm resolution.

"Big Brother, are you all still asking for leave today?"

Before leaving the room, Li Xian walked to Zhao Han's bedside and whispered.

"Let's take another day off," Zhao Han mumbled.

"Alright," Li Xian walked out of the room.

After the sound of footsteps faded away, Zhao Han sat up straight. The second brother, Wang Chun, and the third brother, Zhuo Yilie, also completely woke up, their sleepiness gone.

In fact, the three of them hadn't slept a wink all night.

It turned out that by yesterday afternoon, the swelling had gone down, but three sets of purple掌印 (palm prints) were left on their faces. They were hideous and terrifying, extremely ugly.

Seeing each other's faces, they felt very uncomfortable in their hearts, and the more they thought about it, the less they could sleep.

By the time Li Xian returned to the room and caught up on some more sleep, he got up again at the Mao hour to prepare for the morning training.

"This daily routine is very taxing on one's will. If there's a chance, I must quickly advance to a Grade C protector," Li Xian made a firm resolution.

"Big Brother, are you all still asking for leave today?"

Before leaving the room, Li Xian walked to Zhao Han's bedside and whispered.

"Let's take another day off," Zhao Han mumbled.

"Alright," Li Xian walked out of the room.

After the sound of footsteps faded away, Zhao Han sat up straight. The second brother, Wang Chun, and the third brother, Zhuo Yilie, also completely woke up, their sleepiness gone.

In fact, the three of them hadn't slept a wink all night.

It turned out that by yesterday afternoon, the swelling had gone down, but three sets of purple palm prints were left on their faces. They were hideous and terrifying, extremely ugly.

Seeing each other's faces, they felt very uncomfortable in their hearts, and the more they thought about it, the less they could sleep.

Yesterday, because they went to visit Pang Long, they missed the morning training and did not take the Tiger Blood Pill.

Today, after Li Xian ran three laps around the manor, during the free practice time, he took out the "Tiger Blood Pill" from his chest.

"This pill strengthens bones and generates blood; it is a precious martial arts treasure. After taking it, I wonder what changes will happen to this 'clay figure' of mine."

He swallowed it in one go.

It tasted extremely bitter and fishy, with a foul smell rising in his nasal cavity. It was like sticking his head into a tiger's mouth, full of sour, rotten, and fishy stenches.

As the pill was absorbed and its effects gradually took hold, Li Xian's breathing became exceptionally long and deep. His chest faintly gave off a feeling of "tiger and leopard thunder sound."

Li Xian let out a low shout and threw a punch. Bolstered by the pill's effect, his momentum was like a ferocious tiger pouncing forward. His blood and energy surged, and his vitality was exuberant. He felt an urge to throw a thousand or hundred punches to vent all his blood and energy.

Seizing this time to practice martial arts could yield twice the result with half the effort! He could use the pill's effect to temper his physique, accumulate internal energy, and strengthen his bones!

\[Upon first consuming a rare substance, you have领悟ed (understood) the skill: Consumption.\]

\[Proficiency: 3/500 (Novice)\]

\[Description: Heavenly treasures and earthly herbs, all enter my mouth. When a treasure is before you, knowing how to eat it is very important. Possessing this skill can help you make one part of the medicine achieve two parts of the effect.\]

Since consuming precious medicinal substances, the absorption efficiency is higher.

Li Xian had only taken one Tiger Blood Pill, but the effect he absorbed was ten percent more than what one pill should provide.

As the skill's proficiency increases, one day, it might truly be possible to make "one part of the medicine" achieve the effect of "two parts."

However, to master the skill of [Consumption], one would need to swallow an unknown amount of silver.

"Heaven is helping me!"

Li Xian's spirit was invigorated. He used his martial arts techniques to make rational use of the pill's effect.

For these two hours, he did nothing but throw punches.

Finally, when the pill's effect was exhausted, Li Xian also reaped great rewards.

\[Four Directions Fist\]

\[Proficiency: 125/1500 (Minor Accomplishment)\]

\[Description: On the long path of the fist, a small step forward. Though the achievement is small, it is enough to be proud of. You have diligently practiced the Four Directions Fist and had an epiphany regarding the 'Four Directions Fist Force', achieving minor accomplishment in this path.\]

In his Dantian, the internal energy had accumulated to the size of two fists. The Four Directions Fist is famous for its "external square, internal round." It appears ancient and ordinary, but is actually insidious and cunning.

Combined with the "Four Directions Fist Force," his strength has reached another level.

Not only that.

The Tiger Blood Pill also has the effect of strengthening bones. At this moment, Li Xian's entire body ached in the bones, but it was not an injury. Rather, he was growing, and his bone quality was gradually being strengthened.

"No wonder martial artists are so powerful."

"It's not just that their martial arts skills surpass ordinary people. Even this physique, this 'clay figure,' is being tempered to an extraordinary degree during the martial arts training."

In a flash, it was afternoon.

"Fourth Brother."

"Fourth Brother, come here for a moment."

Li Xian was on patrol, his eyes seeing in all directions and his ears hearing everything. He looked very serious, but was actually slacking off. His mind had drifted far away, completely lost in回味 (replaying) the sequence of fist techniques.

Suddenly, he heard several calls. Turning his head, he saw three figures hiding behind a large tree.

It was Zhao Han and the other two. They were wearing protector uniforms but covering their faces with their hands, hiding in the shadows. Li Xian quickly walked over. "Weren't you all on leave to rest? Why are you out again?"

"Come talk over here," Zhao Han pulled Li Xian to a corner.

"Fourth Brother, us three brothers..." He took a deep breath and let go of the thing covering his face, revealing his purple and blue features.

Ugly and hideous, the palm prints remained vivid and unmoving.

Li Xian had already expected it, but he didn't think it would be so shocking. Zhao Han said, "To be honest with you, this morning... we went to find Jiang Yun."

"Huh?" Li Xian looked at the three of them in confusion.

Wang Chun quickly came over to massage Li Xian's shoulders, saying apologetically, "Fourth Brother, we are brothers, after all. It was indeed wrong of us to keep this from you, but... you've seen it, we're in a terrible state."

Li Xian asked, "What did you say to Jiang Yun?"

Zhao Han gave a bitter smile and rubbed his face. "You can see it, this look of ours, we can't even go out."

"We know that Jiang Yun is after the Tiger Blood Pill. Since you couldn't reach an agreement last time, we three brothers thought we'd go and try to negotiate on your behalf."

"The Tiger Blood Pill is indeed precious, but Fourth Brother, could you just do it for the sake of us brothers and go see Jiang Yun one more time?"
