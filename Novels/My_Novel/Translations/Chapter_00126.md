Chapter 126: The Power of the Strange Phase, the Leopard Blade's Arrogance

Li Xian contemplated his own transformation.

The [Reborn Phase] was not a divine gift, but the revelation of his true form. As a result, certain characteristics had appeared. Just as humans have thousands of appearances, with their own unique features of ugliness, beauty, shortness, thinness, and fatness.

Some characteristics could provide enhancements. Like the Fifth Master of Shanfeng Village, whose [Tiger and Leopard Phase] was quite formidable, as fierce as a tiger and leopard, swift and unmatched.

Some characteristics, however, were not necessarily beneficial.

Li Xian looked inward. His Qi Lake had expanded, now a full "seven zhang" or more in size. Aside from that... aside from the vertical mole on his brow, his appearance had only changed slightly. It seemed there was nothing else.

"Let's test if it has any help with martial arts."

Li Xian planted his feet and executed the "Four Directions Fist" technique. His internal Qi churned, his fist techniques were exceptional. Though he only used his two fists, the afterimages were layered, as if he had grown seven or eight hands.

He threw several punches, then顺势 changed his moves. His feet tapped the ground, and he leaped high into the air, reaching two zhang high. His feet seemed to be wrapped in a gentle breeze...

He尽情挥洒, giving it his all.

After an hour, Li Xian finally understood. When he practiced martial arts, the strange phenomenon he manifested seemed even more obvious.

Before today, his [Four Directions Fist] had reached its peak. When he channeled his internal Qi and used it with all his might, he could only manifest a few afterimages. These afterimages were intangible, mere illusions in the end.

But after washing his fetal impurity and being reborn... his martial arts were unchanged, his skill was the same. However, when he executed them, the Qi phenomenon was completely different. The fist afterimages seemed to take on substance. Though their power was slightly lower, being hit by them head-on would still be no small matter.

The Gale Kick and the Emerald Green Palm had similar增幅.

It was as if this physical body was more adept at producing the strange phenomena of martial arts. Combined with his increased strength and recovery, his power had increased by a significant margin.

"Compared to something like the Tiger and Leopard Phase, my Reborn Phase's enhancement seems more ordinary, without any special abilities. But it's also more comprehensive," Li Xian murmured softly.

"If I had to say what the biggest change is, it's this vertical mole. It's a bit too eye-catching."

"I originally thought my Reborn Phase would be related to my eyes."

Ever since he began washing his胎, his eyes had become increasingly itchy. He had thought the characteristic of his Reborn Phase would appear in his eyes, but he didn't expect it to be a red mole on his brow.

He would have to wait for the Madam to finish refining the pills and then ask her for details.

Li Xian's fetal impurity was nearly washed away, and his Reborn Phase was revealed. It was impossible to hide from the guards in the manor.

During a patrol, all the guards were astonished. They lacked knowledge and hadn't even heard of a "Reborn Phase."

They only saw Li Xian, young and handsome, with an otherworldly aura. His face was already flawless and handsome, now further adorned by the vertical mole on his brow, making him even more distinct from ordinary people.

They all said he must be the reincarnation of a deity.

Some, upon seeing him from afar, would even kneel and kowtow, utterly devout.

Li Xian frowned and told them to act as they usually did. If they pulled such empty gestures again, they would all be punished with canings.

Qiu Yue, upon seeing Li Xian's appearance, was consumed with indescribable jealousy. Yet, amidst her envy, she couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for the Madam upon seeing such a rare and handsome face.

In the first few days, the manor was filled with discussions.

But after it spread and a few more days passed, everyone gradually grew accustomed to it.

In the blink of an eye, it was the fifteenth day since the Madam had started refining the pills.

[Decaying Sunset Withered Blood Sword · First Layer]
[Mastery: 2342/6000 Small Success]

Li Xian held a long sword, practicing in the courtyard. Since his true form was revealed and his [Reborn Phase] appeared, his physique had become even stronger. The burning sensation when practicing the "Decaying Sunset Withered Blood Sword" had eased considerably.

A human body is like a vessel.

If the vessel is crude, it cannot hold much.

"Commander, it's terrible!" a voice suddenly shouted. It was Ding Hu, rushing over in a panic.

As he burst through the gate, he saw Li Xian practicing his sword. The strange phenomenon was extraordinary. The sword seemed to be wrapped in a blazing aura, waves of heat beating against him, forcing him to retreat repeatedly.

"The current Commander Li has probably already surpassed Commander Pang in every aspect. Commander Li is only sixteen, yet he possesses such an appearance, such strength, such talent. If he isn't the reincarnation of a celestial being, what else could he be?" Ding Hu was momentarily mesmerized.

Li Xian sheathed his sword and asked, "What's the matter, to cause such a panic?"

Ding Hu remembered his purpose and hurried into the courtyard to report, "Commander Li, it's... it's the Leopard Blade Sect from Qingning County!"

"Hm?" Li Xian was surprised but remained calm. "Explain the situation clearly first."

Ding Hu detailed the cause:

"The Leopard Blade Sect is too despicable. Commander, you know that the Madam has land, mansions, and shops in the county. As guards, we go into the county to collect rent every few months."

"Now, Qingning County is the territory of the Leopard Blade Sect. No one was willing to go, so we had to send some D-rank guards to collect the rent. Everyone has been trying not to provoke the Leopard Blade Sect, keeping a low profile. Who would have thought they would still spot our men and come to cause trouble..."

"Originally, the few brothers, knowing they were outmatched, were prepared to beg for mercy and avoid conflict. After all, Commander Pang was... But unexpectedly, the Leopard Blade Sect twisted the facts and actually said that the rent for these shops would be collected by them from now on."

"This is an outright robbery of the Madam's property. No matter how cowardly we are, we had to fight back. At first, the conflict wasn't too big; there were only a few people on their side. We wanted to end it quickly and leave Qingning County."

"Who knew that those few, though young, were exceptionally skilled."

"When martial artists clash, it's hard to stop once it starts. And with so many onlookers, we had to grit our teeth and continue the fight."

"This led to a chain reaction. When our side's D-rank fighters couldn't win, we sent C-rank. When their side couldn't beat our C-rank, they called for more powerful help."

"The situation escalated layer by layer, burning bigger and bigger... Now, many of our A-rank guards have gone to suppress the situation. But... their side is also bringing in even more powerful help."

"Commander Li... what should we do now?!" Ding Hu said anxiously.

The situation was already out of control, no longer up to him to decide.

Li Xian said, "Leopard Blade Sect?"

He thought to himself, "The Leopard Blade Sect injured Commander Pang and damaged the Madam's interests, yet the Madam didn't追究. It seems she has a rather indulgent attitude towards this sect. Now the fight is intense..."

"The Madam's intention is nothing more than to weigh the profit and loss. No matter how you look at it, if I take the initiative to back down, the shops in the county will surely be lost, and the Madam will definitely suffer a loss."

"It seems I need to make a trip. Besides, my martial arts have advanced recently. If I have no place to use them, wouldn't that be too boring?"

Li Xian patted the long sword at his waist, his eyes filled with no fear, and shouted, "Let's go!"

On the other side.

Qingning County.

Red Candle Lane was unusually lively today.

The streets were crowded with people, forming a large circle. Two groups of men were fighting fiercely. On the ground lay a dozen or so figures, sprawled in disarray.

The Leopard Blade Sect had about twenty men, all robust and fierce. The guards from the One Union Manor had also come, about twenty of them, but their spirit was clearly weaker. Their expressions were gloomy, with none of the fervor or courage to fight.

The two groups had already gone through a chaotic brawl. Those with weaker martial skills were almost all lying on the ground. The situation had changed to both sides calling for reinforcements, seeing who could overpower the other.

At this moment, two men were fighting in the center.

It was Fang Bichun, an A-rank guard, and an elite disciple of the Leopard Blade Sect.

As the two fought, onlookers couldn't help but secretly shake their heads. Fang Bichun was over forty, while the elite disciple was only twenty.

After a bout of fighting... Fang Bichun, relying on his accumulation of martial arts, had the upper hand, but it was a struggle to secure a victory. In contrast, the other, having gone through several intense fights, grew braver with each battle. Though he was at a disadvantage and sometimes had difficulty defending, his momentum was strong.

"Good, good! Use the Leopard Catching Hand to break his head!"
"Senior Brother, beat this servant to death for me!"

... The Leopard Blade Sect members shouted loudly, bolstering their courage. The One Union Manor guards also wanted to cheer to boost morale, but their voices were drowned out by the opponents, putting them at an even greater disadvantage.

The two factions were of different natures.

Martial arts sects specifically recruit those who have achieved some skill in martial arts, or those with good bone structure and youthful vigor, as disciples. They follow the sect's commands, do things for the sect, and in return receive报酬 and martial arts techniques.

Therefore, under the sect's banner, all are full of blood and vigor.

The One Union Manor guards, though having a foundation in martial arts, their achievement in martial arts and experience in combat depended entirely on individual talent. The Madam would offer guidance, but only once every few years.

Moreover, the primary duty of the guards is to manage the manor's affairs. If their martial arts were too high, it would be difficult to control them.

They lacked the air of the Jianghu.

When fighting others fiercely, they naturally came up short.

Seeing that the fight was dragging on and his own stamina was running out, Fang Bichun knew that if he couldn't win soon, he would surely be counter-attacked. Then it would be a true defeat.

In his urgency, he took a desperate gamble. He deliberately exposed a flaw, waiting for his opponent to strike.

His opponent fell for the trick.

At that moment, Fang Bichun suddenly changed his move, catching his opponent off guard. He barely managed to win the match.

Fang Bichun's internal Qi was depleted, and he was covered in sweat. The victory was truly arduous. He cupped his fists and pleaded for peace, "Brothers of the Leopard Blade Sect, we had no intention of offending you. Let's call it quits here, shall we?"

The disciples of the Leopard Blade Sect sneered repeatedly and said one after another:

"Old thing, who are you to call us brothers? You lot of servants, are you worthy of being brothers with us?"
"Haha, that's hilarious. You only barely beat a third-generation disciple, and you want to call for a truce? Stop talking nonsense. If your pathetic manor has any capable people left, bring them all out. Otherwise... once our senior and junior brothers step in, you won't be able to handle it."
"Exactly, exactly. If it were about serving your master, holding chamber pots, or wiping his ass, we'd admit defeat, bow in admiration, and concede we're no match. But when it comes to fighting, we'll beat you to a pulp."

In the previous close fight, although the One Union Manor won, it lacked any sense of oppression. They had already lost in momentum. Now, hearing the constant insults from the opponents, they wanted to retort but couldn't overpower the other side's noise.

"Senior Brother Peng is here!" a voice cried out from the Leopard Blade Sect.

The crowd parted to make a path. A tall, imposing, and tiger-like man strode towards them. His eyes shone with a sharp light, his steps were steady, his face was square, and his breathing was long and deep.

"Senior Brother Peng! Beat him to death, and vent our anger for us!" the Leopard Blade Sect members clamored.

Senior Brother Peng strode forward. Fang Bichun, intimidated by his aura, wanted to retreat and flee several times, but he had no way out.

Senior Brother Peng looked down at him, his tiger-like eyes piercing into Fang Bichun. The difference between them was like heaven and earth.

Senior Brother Peng was young, strong, and full of spirit. Fang Bichun was middle-aged, of average build, but his spirit was weak and he was timid.

Without even needing to fight... the outcome was already clear.

"Too weak!"

Senior Brother Peng lashed out with a whip-like kick. The speed was so fast that by the time Fang Bichun realized it, the leg, carrying a fierce wind, was already an inch from his head.

With a "thud," Fang Bichun was kicked flying, rolling far away...

He couldn't even withstand a single move.

In the previous battles, the two sides had traded blows back and forth, making for a good spectacle. But now... the A-rank guard, the strongest of the One Union Manor, was so utterly outmatched.

"Senior Brother Peng, beat him to death! Beat him to death!" The sneers, instigations, and curses of the Leopard Blade Sect members rang out.

True to his word, Senior Brother Peng showed no mercy and stomped his foot down towards the guard.
