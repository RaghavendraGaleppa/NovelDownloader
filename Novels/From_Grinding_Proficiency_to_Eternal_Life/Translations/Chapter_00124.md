# Chapter 124: Nine Luminaries Sect

The author: Black Is Better Than a Crow

Xu Yunfan naturally took a liking to the heavy hammer's overwhelmingly fierce and unyielding momentum at a glance, as it shared the same style as the Thirty-Six Style Cloak Hammer he practiced.

If he were to wield it with the divine weapon, the鎏金锏 (Gilded Cudgel), its power would surely rise several levels.

Time flowed like water. After the Disciple Ceremony, Xu Yunfan basically immersed himself wholeheartedly in martial arts training. Every day, he practiced the Cicada Strength Art until his skeletal structure reached its limit.

After largely completing the training of his muscles and skin, he could guarantee an increase of thirty to forty proficiency points daily, nearly doubling his growth efficiency.

In the subsequent time, Xu Yunfan meditated on the Seal of Silence every night. After finishing his morning practice of the Cicada Strength Art, he would practice the Nine Profound Dragon Soaring Cudgel Technique at noon. In the afternoon, he went to his master, Zhan Yan, to learn the Heavenly Palace Forging Technique to forge weapons. At night, he went to the library to read the books from the four halls, and he also browsed through the four basic martial arts manuals and their corresponding knowledge.

His day was packed to the brim.

The other disciples of the Heavenly Work Cave, seeing how Xu Yunfan was so intense every day, couldn't help but start following in his footsteps.

"Damn it."

Yue Shan put down the giant axe in his hands, looking at his originally rough hands which were now covered in blisters, his expression hard to maintain.

He wrapped the linen cloth soaked in medicinal wine around his palms; the blood on the axe handle had already seeped into the wood grain.

He turned his head and stared at the new cracks on the weapon rack. Those were left behind from last night when he tried to imitate Xu Yunfan's shockwave technique. Unfortunately, he never managed to grasp it and even ended up damaging several fine steel giant axes in the process.

He looked up at Qi Huan, who was continuously practicing his sword stance in front of him.

Ever since learning about Xu Yunfan's ascetic-like daily training routine, Qi Huan was also greatly stimulated. He stopped going to the Minyue Tower to listen to music every few days and now hugged his long sword every day, practicing the Thousand Layer Wave Sword.

His level of diligence had increased several times over compared to before.

"Senior Brother Qi, do we really have to be as crazy as Xu Yunfan, training so hard?"

For seven consecutive days, waking up earlier than chickens and going to sleep later than dogs, training from dawn to dusk—even someone made of iron would find it hard to bear.

"The seven thousand six hundredth time."

Qi Huan's hoarse voice came from the corner.

At this moment, his eyes were bloodshot, and the long sword in his hand felt somewhat heavy, yet he still had no intention of giving up.

This chief disciple of the Hidden Edge Pavilion was tying the long sword to his wrist with an iron chain. The muscle fibers of his forearm had swelled two circles due to excessive blood congestion, and every thrust would cause blood beads to ooze from his pores.

The distinctive layered force sound of the Thousand Layer Wave Sword Technique had become chaotic. When he thrust out the final sword, the tip powerlessly drooped three inches short of the target.

In a mine tunnel a hundred zhang beneath the Heavenly Work Cave, where the lights were brightly lit, the玄铁 (Xuantie) pickaxe tip on the mechanical mining pick in Yan Yuwei's hand was almost half worn away.

With every lift and heavy fall of her hands, she could剥落 (peel off) large swathes of Xuantie ore veins. Flying stone fragments were everywhere. Amidst the wisps of golden and iron aura, she utilized the Melting Gold Forging Iron Art to stimulate her blood energy, constantly absorbing it, causing her skin surface to radiate wisps of golden-iron aura.

The disciple beside her, looking at Yan Yuwei who seemed almost on the verge of madness, couldn't help but worry, "Senior Sister, why don't you take a rest? You've been digging without sleep or rest for three days straight. If you continue, your body won't be able to take it, and your martial arts might even regress."

Yue Shan put down the giant axe in his hands, looking at his originally rough hands which were now covered in blisters, his expression hard to maintain.

You've been digging without sleep or rest for three days straight. If you continue, your body won't be able to take it, and your martial arts might even regress."

Yan Yuwei's final pickaxe strike landed, bursting out a large patch of sparks. She then plopped down on the ground, panting heavily, and looked at her hands, which were covered in blood blisters.

Yan Yuwei suddenly let out a curse.

"I, the chief disciple of the Melting Gold Hall, possess talent that is rare in ten thousand. If Xu Yunfan can perfect his muscles and skin, how could I not be able to perfect my skin!"

The disciple beside her, hearing this, couldn't help but mutter, "How can you compare yourself to that monster? That Senior Brother Xu has been obsessed with martial arts since he joined. It's been nearly three months, and he's only left the sect once. The rest of the time, he's been training. The disciples of the Forging Hall say his body is made of玄钢 (mystic steel). He sleeps less than two hours a day; he's bound to shorten his lifespan. Senior Sister, you shouldn't—"

*Pak!*

Yan Yuwei retracted her fist and glanced sideways at the disciple she had punched out of the mine tunnel. She snorted coldly.

"I was born with a Metal Constitution; what do I have to fear from him? If he can do it, so can I!"

Yanbei Dao, Nine Luminaries Mountain in Yanbei Prefecture, the Nine Luminaries Sect.

Seventy-two peaks, like inverted swords piercing through the sea of clouds. The obsidian base on the main peak, Broken Dragon Cliff, is thirty zhang square. Thirteen chains made of meteoric iron run through the mountain body, anchoring nine Great Halls of玄武岩 (basalt) between the cliffs.

At the sect gate stand two bronze statues of Ya (a mythical beast) standing one zhang and eight chi tall, with iron chains hanging from their mouths. The guarding disciples wear heavy armor forged from twenty-eight catties of meteoric iron.

Since the founding of the Nine Luminaries Sect by its first sect master, Chu Yuan, who erected the Iron and Blood Stele on Broken Dragon Cliff during the Yongchang era of the previous dynasty, seventeen generations of sect masters have passed.

During the blood battles to establish the Great Zhou, the Nine Luminaries' three thousand Black Feather Guards broke through seven city gates under a rain of arrows. After the war, the Imperial Bestowed "Suppressing the Mountain Halberd" was inserted in front of the Nine Luminaries Hall.

Over hundreds of years, the sect alone has tens of thousands of disciples, not counting the servants. There are over ten thousand outer disciples, nearly ten thousand inner disciples, and only a few hundred true disciples across the nine peaks of the Nine Luminaries Sect. Not to mention the countless fields and properties, and the businesses they operate; it is practically a nation within a nation.

After the Disciple Ceremony at the Heavenly Work Cave ended, Elder Yin Hong of the Nine Luminaries Sect and Teng Lingchuan, who was silent and looked somewhat dejected, rushed back for seven days and finally returned to the Nine Luminaries Sect.

Yin Hong stood with his hands behind his back at the edge of the Star Gazing Platform. The seventy-two peaks in the twilight were like quenched giant swords piercing the clouds.

The red smoke columns rising from the Melting Iron Peak in the distance cast a mottled light on Teng Lingchuan's bandaged right arm. This was the radius bone cracked by the Thunderfire麒麟 Hammer at the Heavenly Work Cave. Now that he was back at the Nine Luminaries Sect, he naturally had to use the best healing medicine.

Yin Hong glanced at the trembling tendons in his disciple's wrist; that was the hidden injury left from over-exerting the "Xuanji Jade Network Scripture."

"What, are you going to cry and make a fuss over a little setback?"

Teng Lingchuan had grown up in the Nine Luminaries Sect and had been smooth sailing until now. Suffering some setbacks now was actually a good thing.

Teng Lingchuan remained silent for a long while before lowering his voice and saying, "Master, that blow from Xu Yunfan... I feel he didn't use his full strength."

Yin Hong cursed with a laugh, "Anyone could see he didn't go all out. If he really had used his full strength, you would have died on the spot. The Nine Luminaries Sect would probably have to send out an entire peak to make the Heavenly Work Cave pay a heavy price."

Yin Hong spoke casually, and the facts were indeed so. As one of the top sects of the Great Zhou, the Nine Luminaries Sect was an absolute behemoth. That Heavenly Work Cave had only a few thousand disciples and could only support a dozen or so true disciples; how could it compare to the Nine Luminaries Sect?

Hearing Yin Hong's comfort, the expression on Teng Lingchuan's face lifted slightly. He asked, "Will Xu Yunfan die too?"

Yin Hong said casually, "Of course. We don't even need to make a move. That Old Demon Hong will do it himself. What do you think he rushed over for back then? To fight me?"

Teng Lingchuan fell silent for a moment, then lowered his voice and said, "The entry quota for the mountain next year... could it be given to Xu Yunfan? I want to fight him again."
