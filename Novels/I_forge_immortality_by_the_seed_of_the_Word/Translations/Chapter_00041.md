# Chapter 41: Langya County, Yunzhou (Bonus Chapter)

"Slaying demons?"

Zhang Jing repeated the words, then turned to Senior Sister Tong and asked, "Senior Sister, where is the mission location?"

"Langya County, Yunzhou."

Tong Yao replied while staring intently at Zhang Jing, as if searching for any trace of fear on his face.

However, as time passed...

"Ah, Junior Brother, why don't you look the least bit afraid?" Tong Yao asked in surprise.

"Sooner or later this day would come. If Senior Sister isn't afraid, why should I be?"

Zhang Jing answered calmly. After starting talisman crafting, he had gained another trump card. In a true crisis, he could unleash dozens of talismans at once to show enemies what true extravagance and cruelty looked like.

"No fun, I won't tease you anymore."

Tong Yao pouted, then explained in detail:

"A major demon disturbance has broken out in Langya County, and many mission teams have gone there. A deputy captain of the Luo Du team is also stationed there, though I don't know which senior brother it is exactly."

"Anyway, the senior brothers and sisters at late Qi Refinement stage are holding the front lines of the main battlefield. We'll just be dealing with low-level demons in the rear, collecting demon corpses, and waiting for the senior brothers and sisters to eliminate all the demon leaders. That'll complete the mission."

"It's quite simple."

"Senior Sister, how long will this mission last approximately?" Zhang Jing asked again.

If it was going to be too long, he would need to prepare some spirit pills and talisman materials in advance for cultivation, leveling up the Ninefold Stellar Talisman Art, and collecting Source Talisman fragments.

"This senior sister can't estimate that. Maybe... probably... around one or two months?"

Tong Yao guessed.

"Anyway, Junior Brother, you should prepare in advance. We'll gather punctually at the entrance of the Spiritual Crane Garden at the first quarter of the Chen hour the day after tomorrow."

"Understood. Thank you for the reminder, Senior Sister."

"Then this senior sister will take her leave now. See you the day after tomorrow!"

With that, Tong Yao waved her hand casually and left.

Zhang Jing also turned and returned to his cave dwelling, his brows slightly furrowed in thought.

It seemed he would need to visit the Thousand Techniques Pavilion again tomorrow to purchase more spirit pills. He should also buy more spirit paper and ink—if he encountered any emergencies and exhausted his talismans, he could replenish them promptly.

For this mission,

Zhang Jing was preparing for a prolonged campaign.

After organizing his thoughts, he returned to the talisman crafting room.

If not for Senior Sister's notification about the mission, he would currently be testing whether medium-grade spirit paper could bear the talisman patterns imbued with the Nether Python Devouring Void Dao Rhythm.

---

Half a quarter-hour later.

Zhang Jing looked at the medium-grade spirit paper that had once again disintegrated into fragments, momentarily at a loss for words.

If even medium-grade spirit paper couldn't handle it, did that mean he had to try with high-grade spirit paper?

High-grade spirit paper was completely different from medium and low grades—it was made directly from premium demon beast hides, with each sheet being extremely valuable.

Reluctantly, Zhang Jing had to temporarily halt his experiments with Dao Rhythm-infused talismans.

Checking the time,

He went to the cultivation chamber and carefully took out a Water Origin Pill that had cost him a full twenty-eight Dao Merits, placing it in his mouth.

As the Five Viscera Water Origin Guidance Technique operated at full capacity,

The sound of roaring rivers immediately filled the cave dwelling.

---

The next morning.

In the cultivation chamber, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes.

Truly worthy of being a high-grade spirit pill perfectly suited to his cultivation method.

A single Water Origin Pill and one night's cultivation had yielded results comparable to nearly ten days of cultivation using Purple Spirit Pills!

The spiritual power in his dantian had grown significantly thicker. Moreover, whether due to the Water Origin Pill or not, Zhang Jing felt his spiritual power had become purer, and his ability to sense and control water-attribute spiritual energy had strengthened.

Just sitting there cultivating, water vapor began condensing around him.

At this rate,

With about seven more Water Origin Pills, Zhang Jing was confident he could break through to the fourth level of Qi Refinement, directly crossing the threshold between early and mid-stage Qi Refinement.

Unfortunately, time didn't permit.

He would have to wait until after this mission to attempt his breakthrough.

Though with some luck, he might be able to break through to mid-stage Qi Refinement during the mission using Purple Spirit Pills.

Right, today he still needed to visit the Thousand Techniques Pavilion to purchase spirit pills, spirit paper, and spirit ink.

Thinking this,

Zhang Jing immediately got up and headed out.

---

The following day.

Having risen early and prepared, Zhang Jing arrived at the Spiritual Crane Garden ahead of time.

Unexpectedly, a man was already waiting there before him.

The man was extremely tall—a head and a half taller than Zhang Jing—but painfully thin, standing there like a bamboo pole that might be blown away by the wind at any moment.

Contrary to his frail appearance, the man's body faintly emitted spiritual fluctuations far exceeding the third level of Qi Refinement.

Understanding dawned on Zhang Jing.

He walked directly up to the man and tentatively asked, "Senior Brother Ding?"

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing?" The man looked down at Zhang Jing, his gaunt face breaking into a stiff smile: "Pleasure to meet you! Senior Brother Yangchu spoke so highly of you—I was skeptical at first."

"Seeing you today, I realize Senior Brother Yangchu was being too conservative, hahaha."

The man's voice sounded cool, but his tone was extremely warm.

"You flatter me, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said modestly.

"Ah, I mean every word. For you to catch up to Tong Yao and the others in just two months of cultivation is... truly astonishing."

Senior Brother Ding clicked his tongue in amazement.

As they spoke,

Tong Yao and two other men arrived at the Spiritual Crane Garden from different directions.

"Greetings, Senior Brother Ding."

The three spoke in unison.

Senior Brother Ding nodded with a smile.

Then their gazes all turned to Zhang Jing standing beside Senior Brother Ding.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, I'm Xia Yuan. Pleasure to meet you!"

"So this is Junior Brother Zhang. I've heard Tong Yao mention you every day—finally meeting you in person is a pleasure."

"Zhou Zhi, what nonsense are you spouting now?"

Hearing this, Tong Yao immediately scolded angrily, then turned to explain to Zhang Jing: "Junior Brother, don't misunderstand. Senior Brother Yangchu asked me to take good care of you, so I've just mentioned you more often."

"Senior Sister, don't worry. I understand," Zhang Jing reassured her.

Then he turned to the other two and said gently, "Zhang Jing greets Senior Brother Xia and Senior Brother Zhou."

"Alright, since everyone's here, let's head in directly."

Senior Brother Ding, holding the mission credentials, led the way into the Spiritual Crane Garden, with Zhang Jing and the others following closely behind.

Before long,

Five spiritual cranes soared into the sky, heading straight for Yunzhou.

Due to the great distance, the cranes flew in intervals, stopping periodically. After a day and a half of such travel, Zhang Jing and the group gradually arrived in Yunzhou territory.

From high in the air, looking down,

A vast region surrounded by mountains on all sides stretched across their vision.

Dozens to hundreds of magnificent cities were scattered like stars across an endless expanse of forests, interspersed with countless villages and towns as numerous as stars, connected by roads as fine as spiderwebs.

It should have been a beautiful, tranquil scene.

Yet now it was utterly ruined by countless demonic auras rising from below.

"Is this Langya County, Yunzhou?"

Zhang Jing's dark pupils faintly reflected scenes of blood and fire.

The spiritual cranes carrying them began their rapid descent.
