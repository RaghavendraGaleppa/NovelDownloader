# Chapter 98: Five Organs Thunder

Several months passed in the blink of an eye.

At Qingfu Temple, the previous night had brought spring thunder, with flashes of lightning and rumbling thunder.

All the disciples had been temporarily sent down the mountain, leaving only Zhijing, who had once been injured by a master from the Golden Light Temple and later healed by Zhou Qing.

Zhijing waited anxiously by the prepared Thunder Pool—the place where the Little Martial Uncle had arranged to receive the heavenly thunder. Last night, a slight mishap had occurred. While guarding the Thunder Pool during Senior Brother Xiao of the Taihe Sect's reception of the heavenly thunder, a bolt of lightning had unexpectedly struck the Little Martial Uncle.

Zhijing had seen the Little Martial Uncle spew a mist of blood by the pool's edge, and his heart had nearly stopped. Although both his master and the Little Martial Uncle were innate masters, in the current world, the Little Martial Uncle was the true pillar of their hearts. Without him, Qingfu Temple would never have achieved its current sacred status. Moreover, the legend that the Little Martial Uncle was an envoy of the Dao Court was something Zhijing and the others firmly believed, given the many miraculous events that had occurred around him.

At that moment, seeing the Little Martial Uncle spitting blood, Zhijing had almost thought the sky was falling. However, the Little Martial Uncle had calmly instructed him to carry Senior Brother Xiao away quickly and, despite his injuries, returned to his meditation chamber, telling Zhijing not to disturb him.

A long time passed with no movement from the Little Martial Uncle in the chamber, and Zhijing grew increasingly anxious. Zhou Qing had previously told him to guard Senior Brother Xiao and not panic, but as time dragged on, Zhijing couldn't calm his mind. Senior Brother Xiao remained unconscious, and there was still no sign of the Little Martial Uncle in the adjacent chamber.

Suddenly, a thunderous explosion erupted from the neighboring chamber, shattering the door. Zhijing rushed over and, as the dust settled, saw the Little Martial Uncle emerge, looking much more haggard than before but with eyes gleaming with divine light, deepening Zhijing's awe.

"Zhijing, come here."

"Yes."

As Zhijing approached, Zhou Qing suddenly struck his lower back with a palm. Zhijing felt an inexplicable numbness spread through his body, rendering him momentarily weak, before he spat out a mouthful of black blood and felt an overwhelming sense of relief.

"Years ago, you were injured in the kidneys by a monk from the Golden Light Temple. Although I healed you, your stubbornness led you to push yourself in martial arts, leaving hidden injuries. Now, I've used thunder techniques to heal them. Rest well for the next few months, and your skills will advance further."

"Thank you, Little Martial Uncle."

"Go and meditate for a while, then summon Zhishui and Zhishou back to guard outside this chamber."

"As you command."

After sending Zhijing away, Zhou Qing exhaled softly, his breath still tinged with blood. His five organs had suffered varying degrees of damage, worse than when he had slain the Grassland Martial Sage, Baji. Yet, he couldn't suppress the joy on his face—his Palm Thunder had finally reached mastery.

Last night, while helping Xiao Ruowang receive the heavenly thunder, Zhou Qing had extended his divine sense to observe and inadvertently attracted a bolt of lightning, effectively sharing the thunder reception with Xiao. He had anticipated this possibility and taken precautions, but his body still sustained injuries. However, through the life-and-death battle with Baji and this thunder reception, Zhou Qing had advanced his Palm Thunder to "Proficiency."

Moreover, his Five Organs Exercise had evolved into the "Five Organs Thunder," and his true qi now centered around his heart. His training in the Five Animal Exercises and Five Organs Exercises had begun with the Tiger Exercise and its mantra, progressing step by step, with the Ape Exercise and its mantra being the final hurdle. The emergence of the Five Organs Thunder, however, started with the most challenging—the heart, corresponding to the Ape Exercise.

Previously, Zhou Qing had mastered the Five Organs Thunder Sound, using it to temper his organs and refine his bones. Now, the true thunder power of the Five Organs Thunder would catalyze another transformation of his body—his third such metamorphosis. The potential of his five organs would be unleashed, and once his injuries healed, his physical cultivation would reach the third level, with his Indestructible Vajra Body advancing further.

With his true qi centered in his heart and tempered by Heart Fire Thunder, Zhou Qing would soon break through to the seventh layer of Qi Refinement, entering the late stage. His attention turned to the Health Lord:

Heart Fire Thunder (Basic Proficiency).

From now on, his Palm Thunder would be driven by Heart Fire Thunder. The Five Organs Thunder could be used for both internal refinement and external release. The Five Animal Exercises and Five Organs Exercises had led him step by step to the Five Organs Thunder Sound and Palm Thunder. His three bodily transformations had begun with the Five Animal Exercises and continued with the Five Organs Thunder, showing no signs of stopping. This process was also a progression and metamorphosis of both qi and body, with his powerful soul serving as the foundation.

Without a strong soul, this process would be impossible to control.

"Additionally, breaking and rebuilding is key. My body grows stronger, making it harder to sustain injuries. Life-threatening damage instinctively stimulates the potential of qi, body, and soul, further elevating my abilities—but it also risks death."

Life instinctively seeks to preserve itself in the face of annihilation, with reproduction being its continuation. The Taihe Sect had always been the same; otherwise, they wouldn't have collaborated with the Prince of Qinghe or supported so many impoverished scholars—seeking fame while spreading their teachings.

"Indeed. By the way, Brother, please keep an eye on Wan'er while she takes the Marrow-Cleansing Pill in the imperial city."

"Don't worry. I've prepared many nourishing and blood-replenishing pills for her to take alongside the Marrow-Cleansing Pill. With me here, nothing will go wrong."

"Thank you, Brother."

"No need for formalities between us."

As they spoke, Lin Wan'er arrived with urgent news from Mount Taihe. Zhou Qing's expression shifted slightly upon reading the letter. Despite Zhang Jingxiu's presence, something had gone wrong.

"Ghost Vine? The Great Pine?"

According to Zhang's letter, a Ghost Vine demon had appeared near Mount Taihe, evading detection until it entangled itself around the Great Pine. Together, they proved too much for even Zhang to handle. The Ghost Vine had grown to a point where it was impervious to fire, and Zhang's divine sense had detected numerous beast souls within it, suggesting it had emerged from the deep mountains after slaughtering many creatures, possibly even demonic beasts.

Zhou Qing immediately set out for Mount Taihe, not bothering to summon Fushan and the others. If even he couldn't handle the Ghost Vine, their presence would be meaningless. From the letter, it seemed Zhang could hold his own but was outmatched. Zhou Qing's swift arrival should prevent the Ghost Vine from growing beyond his ability to handle.

Still, the incident served as a warning. While demons in the mortal realm could be detected early, those in the deep mountains were nearly impossible to find beforehand. With countless beasts and even demonic beasts lurking there, a demon that consumed or parasitized such creatures could easily surpass the terror of the Grassland Martial Sage possessed by the Ghost Vine.

"How many more of these demons are hidden away?" Zhou Qing wondered, torn between excitement and concern. Demons were rare cultivation resources, but the mortal realm might eventually spawn a monster even he couldn't defeat. Regardless, he had to deal with the immediate threat—and he still had his eye on the Great Pine's pinecones. He couldn't let the Ghost Vine eat them.

Lin Wan'er and Butcher Hu were Zhou Qing's staunch followers, while his two martial brothers and Old Zhang were true comrades. Now, Xiao Ruowang could be added to the list. However, Zhou Qing knew that while Xiao was a good man, his thirst for immortality paled in comparison to the other four, even Fushan.

Despite Fushan's occasional frivolity, his creation of the Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm showed his dedication to cultivation. If not for the overshadowing presence of the three innate masters, Fushan might have been dismissed as a mediocre figure in an era lacking true heroes. Still, Xiao Ruowang's youth and vitality meant the debate over who was the fifth strongest in the world—Fushan or Xiao—would continue.

Zhou Qing left Yuan Mingyue to guard the base and study foundational arrays for communication, hoping to establish faster messaging systems for the innate masters stationed across the land. After helping Lin Wan'er achieve Qi Refinement, he planned to consider Yuan Mingyue's own pill-assisted refinement, though he hoped she could follow the thunder-reception path for greater potential.

"Xiao, you're not holding back!" Fushan, caught off guard, was nearly knocked off his feet by Xiao Ruowang's surprise attack.

Zhou Qing chuckled. "Second Brother, you just couldn't dodge his technique because your divine sense isn't refined enough. When fighting demons, do they go easy on you?"

"Qingzhi, stop distracting me," Fushan retorted before focusing and eventually overpowering Xiao after a hundred exchanges. "I concede," Xiao said with a wry smile.

Fushan turned to Zhou Qing. "Qingzhi, is my title as the fourth strongest well-deserved?"

"For now. Might not hold in the future."

Fushan coughed, resolving to train harder. He was determined to keep his ranking—after all, Old Zhang and the elder martial brother were older, so yielding to them was a matter of respect. Losing to Xiao Ruowang? Unthinkable. Fushan had his pride.

As for Zhou Qing, Fushan had long since stopped comparing. The man was a Dao Court envoy, a celestial reincarnate—utterly different from those like himself who had clawed their way to innate mastery through sheer effort. In theory, Zhou Qing had centuries, if not millennia, of cultivation in his past life. Being stronger was no surprise.

The myth of Zhou Qing's divine origins was now an article of faith for Fushan.

Leaving Fushan and Xiao to guard outside, Zhou Qing sought out Fushan in the imperial city's underground alchemy chamber. As he entered, a fiery dragon surged toward him. Zhou Qing countered with a Cloud-Parting Palm, the two forces canceling each other out and filling the chamber with mist, reminiscent of the ethereal atmosphere around the Supreme Elder's furnace in *Journey to the West*.

"Elder Brother, your Dragon-Subduing Skill for fire control has grown even more impressive."

Fushan straightened his robes and smiled. "Little Brother, you've progressed as well. What's your current cultivation?"

"Third level of body refinement, late-stage Qi Refinement. Nothing much."

Fushan: "..."

After appraising Fushan's latest elixirs, Zhou Qing had to admit his elder brother's alchemical talent rivaled his own. They exchanged insights before collaborating to refine Qi Condensation Pills, Eighth-Grade Blood Pills, and Marrow-Cleansing Pills using the earth's fire. Though alchemy was complex, both had advanced far beyond their earlier selves, making the process smooth. Zhou Qing checked his Health Lord:

Basic Alchemy (Proficient).

At his current level, he could effortlessly refine any pill needed before forming his Dao Foundation. Fushan's divine sense was far weaker, limiting his control over pill quality, but experience allowed him to stabilize results over time. Now, even the pills required for early innate cultivation were within Fushan's grasp, and he could assist Zhou Qing with more complex concoctions.

"Brother, we'll need a better cauldron for higher-tier pills," Zhou Qing remarked, noting cracks in the imperial cauldron from prolonged exposure to the earth's fire.

"Indeed. Collecting materials for a new one falls to you."

"I'll arrange it. On the fifteenth of August, Old Zhang is scheduled to debate the Ming King of the Esoteric Sect. I'll be traveling to the Great Snow Mountain for the event—a major gathering of the martial world. Old Zhang asked me to back him up discreetly in case he falters."

"If he wins, your presence won't be necessary," Fushan said, shaking his head at Zhang's vanity. The Taihe Sect had always been this way, courting fame through alliances and patronage—spreading their teachings while building renown.

"True enough. Oh, and please keep an eye on Wan'er during her Marrow-Cleansing Pill regimen."

"Rest assured. I've prepared supplementary pills to nourish her blood and vitality. With me here, nothing will go wrong."

"Much obliged."

"Between us, no need for thanks."
