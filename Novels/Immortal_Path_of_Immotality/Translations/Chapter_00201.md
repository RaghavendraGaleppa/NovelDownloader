# Chapter 199: The Tables Have Turned

An hour later, a golden streak swiftly crossed the distant horizon.

After a cultivator reaches the Golden Core stage, their spiritual power undergoes a transformation, eliminating the need for artifact-based flight like Foundation Establishment cultivators. Instead, they naturally master the "Rainbow Transformation Technique"—not a spell or divine ability, but merely a small trick utilizing spiritual power.

Artifact flight not only requires using spiritual sense to control objects for carrying people but also consumes spiritual energy, making it a last resort for Foundation Establishment cultivators.

In contrast, the Golden Core stage's Rainbow Transformation Technique allows instantaneous flight over great distances—fast, impressive, and convenient, making it the preferred method for high-level cultivators.

Of course, some might prefer alternative flight methods like "auspicious clouds," "spiritual mist," "whirlwinds," or "magical wings," with preferences varying widely.

Rumors say some eccentric Golden Core cultivators even enjoy "spiritual power horses," riding phantom beasts carved from spiritual energy across the skies—a peculiar but understandable choice.

At the Nascent Soul stage, with another leap in cultivation, one can manipulate the power of heaven and earth, eliminating the need to expend personal spiritual energy. They can tread empty air effortlessly, standing firmly in the sky as surrounding spiritual energy automatically supports them.

This is a realm of ability far beyond ordinary comprehension.

The golden streak in the sky was unbelievably fast, catching up in no time.

However, because the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had deliberately laid false trails along the way, scattering traces of their aura in multiple directions that all vaguely pointed further ahead, the pursuer misjudged their location and flew right over their heads without stopping.

But just as the pursuer passed over the Absolute Killing Pit, two massive arrays erupted with radiant light, covering an area of one square mile.

Amidst the shimmering ripples, the illusion array and killing array overlapped. Dense forests instantly materialized within, and the surrounding space seemed to stretch endlessly. Waves of baleful energy began to condense as five towering ghostly figures stirred within the formation.

At the center of the array, the golden streak abruptly halted, revealing a burly figure.

A middle-aged man clad in a moon-white Confucian robe stood tall and imposing, with thick black eyebrows and dignified features, resembling a high-ranking official or noble from the imperial court.

This was undoubtedly the mastermind behind the recent attacks on the Lin Clan Trading Company—the Golden Core cultivator from the Dai Clan stationed in Moonview City.

Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord observed from outside the array. Despite being suddenly trapped, the Dai Clan's Golden Core cultivator remained calm and composed, exuding the demeanor of a true expert. As he scanned his surroundings with sharp, glowing eyes, it seemed he possessed some form of truth-seeing pupil technique.

"How interesting," he murmured.

---

The Dai Clan's Golden Core cultivator smirked subtly. After carefully surveying his surroundings, he nodded calmly, as if having already seen through the illusion array. He then clapped his hands and laughed heartily:

"You two from the Lin Clan Trading Company certainly have guts, daring to ambush me midway. No wonder you managed to build your business from scratch in Moonview City."

"Unfortunately, your skills are lacking. Did you really think such crude array techniques could trap a Golden Core cultivator? How naive!"

"Come out now! I've seen through your little tricks—you can't hide from my eyes!"

As he spoke, golden flames erupted wherever his gaze landed, especially at several key hidden array nodes made of Illusion Spirit Wood. They were all burned to ashes in moments!

Though Illusion Spirit Wood was a fourth-tier illusion material, once separated from the Illusion Spirit Ancient Tree, it became extremely fragile and couldn't withstand the spells of a Golden Core cultivator.

The entire illusion array began to tremble and flicker. With a series of explosive cracks, the light screen shook violently, and all the illusory forests faded in and out of existence.

"What?!" 

Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord, crouching outside the array, were shocked. They hadn't expected the Dai Clan's Golden Core cultivator to be so formidable, seeing through their carefully laid trap so easily. Was he an array master?

Their hearts pounded with unease—had they bitten off more than they could chew?

Seeing no one emerge, the Dai Clan cultivator chuckled lightly and shook his head with a sigh, as if everything was under his control:

"Enough. I know where you're hiding. Come out now and meet your end sooner rather than later. Must I drag you out myself?"

As he spoke, beams of golden light shot from his pupils, scanning the surroundings before converging on two specific points outside the Five Ghosts Yin Killing Array—precisely where the two were hiding.

"Holy shit!!!"

Lin Shan and his companion were dumbfounded, shrinking back in fear. They'd truly encountered a formidable opponent.

Not only was this Dai Clan cultivator skilled in arrays, but his pupil technique was also terrifyingly powerful—he'd pinpointed their hiding spot outside the formation with ease!

Was this the true might of a Golden Core cultivator?

After waiting a while longer with no response, the Dai Clan cultivator's expression shifted to one of intrigue. Unhurried, he continued in a coaxing tone:

"You two have talent in commerce, establishing your market in Moonview City within just over a decade and expanding the seafood trade to such scale. Why not join me? With my backing, you'd have support wherever you go."

---

As he spoke leisurely, he turned his back to them, hands clasped behind him as if awaiting their reply. Meanwhile, the array groaned under increasing strain.

Lin Shan barely dared to breathe, glaring accusingly at the Black Skeleton Demon Lord. This was the "easy target" you picked? Didn't you check if he had powerful array or pupil techniques beforehand?

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord was equally baffled. This Dai Clan cultivator had only recently reached Golden Core and was previously unknown. How could anyone predict his hidden abilities? Besides, most cultivators kept their trump cards secret—it had only made selections based on limited external information.

This failure wasn't its fault!

Seeing continued silence, the Dai Clan cultivator's expression darkened slightly. With a hint of impatience, he warned:

"I'm showing mercy out of appreciation for your talents. If you remain stubborn, you'll soon regret it..."

Lin Shan and his companion stayed silent, hearts filled with dread.

After another half-stick of incense time passed, the Dai Clan cultivator sighed deeply. He withdrew his rough hands from his sleeves, preparing to unleash a formidable spell:

"Very well. Since you refuse to see reason, I'll send you on your way. When you reincarnate, don't say I didn't give you a chance."

His aura surged, radiant golden light erupting around him—a锋芒 so sharp it seemed capable of piercing through the array in an instant!

Standing there, his dazzling figure resembled a blazing sun, illuminating everything with overwhelming might.

"!!!"

Lin Shan's back was drenched in cold sweat. Not only was this Dai Clan cultivator proficient in arrays and pupil techniques, but he also knew minor divine abilities?!

He cursed the Black Skeleton Demon Lord inwardly—useless! He'd trusted its judgment, only to provoke such a terrifying opponent.

It seemed his only option was to retrieve the Void Star Disc spirit treasure and enhance his Wind Escape Talisman for a quick getaway. The materials for these two arrays—worth nearly a hundred thousand spirit stones—would have to be abandoned. Even profit-seekers knew when to prioritize survival.

What a disaster—not only had they failed to reclaim the Lin Clan Trading Company's losses, but they'd also wasted a fortune on these arrays. A total loss.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord stood frozen, utterly confused. It had specifically investigated beforehand—this Dai Clan cultivator was a new Golden Core, supposedly an easy target. Who knew he'd been hiding his strength?

Meanwhile, the Dai Clan cultivator had been charging his attack for a full quarter-hour, the glowing orb in his hands still held back, as if reluctant to release it. He delivered one final ultimatum:

---

"Heaven favors the virtuous. I truly hesitate to destroy talents like yours. With your commercial skills working for me, you could become my most trusted aides. This chance to align with a Golden Core cultivator won't come again!"

Lin Shan and his companion watched the glowing orb with a mix of fear and confusion. Why was this Dai Clan cultivator so long-winded? Had years in Confucian academies made him this pedantic?

The situation was clearly irreconcilable—why keep talking instead of attacking?

What they didn't know was...

The Dai Clan Golden Core cultivator in the array wasn't delaying by choice—he was afraid acting would expose his bluff.

Trapped between a rock and a hard place, beads of sweat formed imperceptibly on his forehead. With five Golden Core-level ghost generals eyeing him menacingly and the illusion array showing signs of recovery, panic set in!

He was indeed a newly advanced Golden Core cultivator—no doubt about it. Over the past decade, he'd been busy gathering materials for his life-bound magic treasure, having only recently emptied his savings to commission a refining master. The treasure now rested in his dantian, undergoing nurturing.

His earlier destruction of the illusion array's nodes and detection of the duo outside the formation were only possible because of a piece of Illusion Spirit Wood and a vial of Illusion Spirit Liquid acquired at a high-end auction five years prior.

That's right—he was the "Scholar" who'd traded with Lin Shan at that auction.

The Illusion Spirit Wood he'd obtained from Lin Shan and the wood Lin Shan used for the array came from the same Illusion Spirit Ancient Tree—they shared the same origin.

Thus, when trapped in the "Illusion Heart Confusion Array," he could sense all the array's Illusion Spirit Wood nodes through the treasure refined from his own piece, allowing him to dismantle the formation systematically. Pure luck.

As for locating the duo outside the array, he'd consumed the entire vial of Illusion Spirit Liquid to temporarily enhance his truth-seeing pupil technique, precisely pinpointing their position.

The glowing orb in his hands? It was indeed a minor metal-element divine ability, a Dai Clan secret.

But... he hadn't mastered it yet.

Having only reached Golden Core a decade ago, he'd spent his time consolidating his cultivation and gathering materials for his life-bound treasure. The Dai Clan's divine ability was recorded on a jade slip without any "divine intent" to aid comprehension, so he'd only grasped the basics.

---

A cultivation clan's divine ability jade slip would naturally be heavily guarded, with elders and geniuses taking turns studying the Nascent Soul ancestor's recorded demonstrations. Depending on aptitude, mastery could take decades.

Right now, he could only produce a glowing orb to intimidate others. If released, it would just be an oversized light spell—a dead giveaway.

Awkward.

As an early Golden Core cultivator with shallow spiritual power reserves, a still-nurturing life-bound treasure, an unmastered divine ability, and no combat experience against peers, this was his weakest state. Could there be a worse Golden Core cultivator?

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord had actually chosen well—the target was theoretically perfect. The blame lay with Lin Shan himself, who'd inadvertently "armed the enemy" at that auction, creating this farce.

As Lin Shan observed from outside, he gradually sensed something amiss. So this Dai Clan cultivator's earlier intimidation—breaking the array and locating them—was all a bluff?

All bark and no bite, putting on an act? How audacious!

Lin Shan slowly relaxed. Good thing he hadn't fled immediately—he'd nearly been fooled.

Meanwhile, the Dai Clan cultivator inside the array, still clutching his "light spell," watched the unmoving duo outside. His face cycled through shades of gold and yellow as he debated whether to release the orb.

He'd assumed these two Foundation Establishment youngsters would be easy prey for a Golden Core cultivator like himself. But encountering a Golden Core-level array laid by an array master? That changed everything.

An array master's status in the cultivation world rivaled a Golden Core cultivator's—most forces would treat them as honored guests, not enemies.

Given his current state, with a few more decades to refine his life-bound treasure and grasp his divine ability, he'd be formidable among Golden Core cultivators. But fresh from Foundation Establishment, facing a killing array enhanced by the Absolute Killing Pit's terrain? He wasn't confident, fearing an upset defeat.

With a Golden Core lifespan of four hundred years, why risk everything against two juniors? Better to retreat and return stronger.

---

Of course, given his experience and the Illusion Spirit Wood connection, he'd quickly deduced that the Lin Clan Trading Company's leader was none other than that stingy "Bear Mountain Master" from the auction!

Seeing his act fail, the Dai Clan cultivator dropped pretense, extinguishing the orb with a mix of bluster and unease:

"Bear Mountain Master, I know it's you! Never expected you to have such methods and cunning! I admit defeat—withdraw the array, and let's settle this peacefully. What say you?"

Lin Shan paused.

Bear Mountain Master? So...

Quickly connecting the dots from the man's words and actions, he realized their past connection.

"You're the 'Scholar'? No wonder you saw through my array. How was that vial of Illusion Spirit Liquid?"

The Dai Clan cultivator's golden pupils dimmed—the liquid was exhausted. As the duo's figures blurred outside the array and baleful energy continued gathering within, surrounded by five Golden Core ghost generals, he grew desperate:

"Indeed, I am the Scholar. Brother Bear Mountain, remember our pleasant chat at the auction? Why resort to violence now?"

Lin Shan, now confident, straightened up with a cold tone:

"Pleasant chat? You must misunderstand the term—you tried to fleece me back then! How dare you bring it up now!"

The Dai Clan cultivator smiled awkwardly, discarding dignity:

"A misunderstanding, Brother Bear Mountain! I was only joking—you didn't lose out in the end, did you?"

Lin Shan scoffed, arms crossed:

"Easy for you to say now. Weren't you just threatening my trading company? Why the sudden change?"

The Dai Clan cultivator, thick-skinned, coughed lightly:

"Merely curious about the mastermind behind Lin Clan Trading Company—who could dominate Moonview City's seafood trade in a decade! Turns out it's you, Brother Bear Mountain! With your strategic brilliance, you'll surely become a rising star in the cultivation world's commerce!"

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord bristled—it had built the trading company, not Lin Shan! But before it could protest, Lin Shan silenced it and continued indignantly:

"Let's set that aside. What did you mean by 'an ant trying to shake a tree' or 'a mantis trying to stop a chariot' in your message?"

The Dai Clan cultivator waved it off:

"You misunderstood. I meant to encourage you—with hard work, even small figures can achieve greatness. All immortals start somewhere!"

Lin Shan nodded skeptically:

"And 'the fish will die, but the net may not break'?"

"Ah, I was simply curious about your fishing tools for seafood."

"'Other hills' stones can polish jade'?"

"Advice to diversify beyond seafood! Our Dai Clan has mining connections—we could collaborate!"

"'The net of heaven is vast; none escape its meshes'?"

"A reminder to stay vigilant in business and cultivation alike—even sages make mistakes!"

Truly, the Dai Clan cultivator's scholarly background shone through—he could twist any phrase.

But Lin Shan, seizing this rare chance to vent, continued mocking him until even the Black Skeleton Demon Lord tugged his sleeve, signaling restraint.

The Dai Clan cultivator, now hoarse from explanations and inwardly fuming, forced a smile:

"Brother Bear Mountain, how about this: withdraw, and I swear to never trouble you again."

"Swear? You think I'm a fool?"

"Wait—I can make a Dao Heart oath!"

"No need!"

Lin Shan brandished his Severing Water Sword—with the advantage now his, it was time to strike!

Seeing the法宝, the Dai Clan cultivator paled. Before he could react, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord activated the Five Ghosts Yin Killing Array. The ghost generals roared, charging with their tridents.
