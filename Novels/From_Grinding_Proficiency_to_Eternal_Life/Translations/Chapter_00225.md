# Chapter 225: The Old Ape

Before the seventh form of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer was even fully executed, the shockwave generated by the hammer head had already shattered the rock wall ten zhang away into a spiderweb of cracks. With every movement, the pure Yang internal energy within his body churned violently.

This technique was undoubtedly the pinnacle among the Outer Three Harmonies of the Dao Sect. Had it been practiced during the era when the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth was abundant, it would have been considered a top-tier Qi cultivation method. However, had the spiritual energy not revived, this martial art would likely have been unable to display its true power.

Even with the aid of the attribute panel, it only managed to perfectly integrate the strength of bones, muscles, and skin into one, yet it was still impossible to cultivate pure Yang internal energy.

"It's not enough... more!"

A low growl rolled from Xu Yunfan's throat. His muscles bulged, and blue veins popped out. If one were to peel away his Dragon Scale Armor, they would clearly see the Red Serpent Mountain-Piercing Strength flowing beneath his skin like molten lava, constantly surging within his muscles.

He let go of his restraint on the pure Yang Qi and unbuckled the mechanical box at his waist to reveal the Ginseng Spirit's head. Before the Ginseng Spirit could react, Xu Yunfan took a deep breath and forcefully pressed the oblivious creature back inside.

Scorching ginseng energy rushed into his lungs. Under the wash of the massive amount of ginseng spiritual marrow, the intense pain only stimulated the Red Serpent Mountain-Piercing Strength to run wild. Cracks appeared on the surface of the Steel Tempered Body, only to be rapidly healed under the scouring of the spiritual energy.

When the Red Serpent Mountain-Piercing Strength was cycled for the forty-ninth time, a sudden change occurred.

Xu Yunfan's eyes turned bloodshot. The seventeenth move of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer, "Eight Desolations Return to the Stream," struck out uncontrollably.

"So that's how it is... The true meaning of the Red Serpent Mountain-Piercing Strength is to bear a thousand jun of weight while coiling around the mountain to shake the great peaks. The three training methods ultimately boil down to using force to shake the mountain."

Xu Yunfan panted heavily, kneeling on one knee before a stretch of scorched earth plowed out by the hammer wind for a hundred zhang.

Fine cracks covered the surface of the Steel Tempered Body, healing at a visible speed under the nourishment of the spiritual energy.

He suddenly let out a wild laugh and swung the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel, weighing over a thousand jun, in a blur of afterimages. This time, there was no sound of air explosions; all the force condensed into a single, hidden line of force. Thirty zhang away, the rock wall silently turned into dust.

The information on the panel in his vision appeared once again.

‘Your Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer seems to have grasped a bit of its intent, and its proficiency has increased significantly.’

Fifteen points of proficiency!

Xu Yunfan's expression shook. He looked out toward that spiritually gifted place, a location for finding dragon veins by mining, where the mountain peaks gathering the terrain of mountains and rivers even had a bit of spiritual mist drifting about.

Compared to the valley he currently stood in, it was like the difference between a great wizard and a minor one.

After packing his things and securing the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer on his back with the armor leaves, confirming it was stable, he hesitated no longer.

He took a light breath and slightly moved his hands and feet.

Xu Yunfan wanted to test just how fast his current full-speed sprint was.

The moment the fascia of his foot arch exploded with sound, the entire rock beneath him shattered.

The muscle patterns of the Steel Tempered Body bulged beneath the skin like a geological map, and the sound of his two hundred and six bones locking together actually suppressed the howling of the mountain wind.

His spine, bearing the three hundred and twenty-jun Thunderfire Qilin Hammer and the sixty-plus-jun Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel, arched like a full moon. His shoulder blades collided like two tectonic plates, and the recoil propelled his body forward like a red arrow.

The Dragon Scale Armor moved with the flow, adjusting the leaves to better slice through the air. The scorching breath spraying from the gaps left a ten-zhang trail of fire behind him, and every time his toes touched the ground, they炸开 a bowl-sized crater in the rock.

When the Qiu Dragon Shaking Sea Strength surged between the fascia, it sounded like the roar of a river. The twelve main tendons jumped like bowstrings, and the Red Serpent Mountain-Piercing Strength bursting from his back pumped into his legs at a terrifying speed. He crossed a ten-zhang cliff in just three steps. When the third step shattered the cliff wall to borrow force, the flying stones were like flying locust stones, pounding the surroundings with thudding sounds.

The spine, the great dragon, rang out segment by segment like a chain of thunderclaps. As his waist and hips twisted, they pulled out visible ripples of air.

The heavy hammer on his back was not a burden but rather like a strong bow fitted with a heavy armor-piercing arrow. Every muscle of the Steel Tempered Body turned into a spring filled with power.

Passing through the ancient pine forest in an instant, the branches snapped by the hammer wind had not yet hit the ground when his figure had already shattered seven layers of water mist and rushed to the mountainside.

The wind at the mountain peak was like a blade. Xu Yunfan, bare-chested, stood on the Dragon Severing Rock.

The patterns of the hundred-zhang rock layer beneath his feet followed the trends of the earth's veins. When he activated the Pure Yang One Qi Art, the white breath spewing from his mouth and nose actually condensed in mid-air into a clearly visible arrow of Qi that shot out thirty meters before slowly dissipating.

The arch of his right foot suddenly pressed down three inches, and the fascia of his sole undulated like an earthworm turning over. The air explosion sound brought about by the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer startled and scattered the spiritual mist filling the sky.

Xu Yunfan did not hesitate in the slightest. While using his pure Yang internal energy to draw the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth into his mouth and nose, he directly摆出 the Barefoot Mountain-Piercing Stance. He drew out the Red Serpent Mountain-Piercing Strength hidden in the core muscle groups of his back muscles, letting it flow throughout his body and spiral up along the spine, the great dragon.

Not long after, Xu Yunfan's muscles and tendons were like red-hot steel wires twisted together. The sweat seeping from his pores was steamed into white mist before it could hit the ground.

‘You absorbed several particles of spiritual energy. Your Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer proficiency has increased.’

Just as he was about to stop and adjust his breathing, a sound like muffled thunder in the mountain suddenly came to his ears.

Xu Yunfan turned his head to look, and his pupils constricted. At the edge of the cliff seven zhang away, five rock pillars exploded in succession.

A giant, white-haired palm reached out from the dust, and the碎骨 embedded in its nail gaps sparked against the mountain rocks.

It was a white-haired old ape, standing a full zhang high, its body covered in hair as hard as steel needles, with knotted muscles.

At this very moment, it was staring intently at Xu Yunfan standing atop the mountain peak with a pair of blood-red eyes.

As the old ape crashed through the final mountain barrier to climb up, Xu Yunfan's toes tapped lightly, using the force to retreat ten meters.

This white ape's fur was as hard as steel needles. A half-broken bronze chain remained on its shoulder, and the empty right eye socket was covered in dark red granulation tissue.

Most terrifying were the chains wrapped around its fists. The thousand-jun stone pillars attached to the ends had plowed deep trenches in the ground.

Demon Beast!

Xu Yunfan's pupils shook slightly. He had never expected to encounter a demon beast in this place.

It seemed the secret realm was not peaceful either.

"Clang!"

The stone pillar on the old ape's left fist swept across without warning. In the instant Xu Yunfan leaned back into an Iron Plate Bridge, the armor-piercing cone at the end of the hammer handle precisely inserted itself into a gap in the chain.

The Red Serpent Mountain-Piercing Strength spiraled and erupted along his arm bone, attempting to pull the demon beast off its balance point.

Unexpectedly, the muscles on the old ape's right arm suddenly swelled three圈. When the chain went taut, the exploding sparks actually deflected the hammer head by half a foot.

Xu Yunfan felt a bit of numbness in his tiger's mouth. He exhaled a breath of blood energy, and the sensation disappeared completely.

He noticed a depression in the old ape's right knee joint—a sign of an old injury.

This demon beast seemed to have suffered a rather heavy injury in the past; otherwise, with a demon beast's vitality, it would have definitely recovered completely.

The heavy hammer suddenly changed its move to the "Mountain Lifting Style," scraping the edge of the stone pillar as it swept upward!

"Ring!"

The piercing sound of metal striking metal shook the accumulated snow off the mountain peak.

The old ape howled in pain and retreated three steps, black blood spurting from the old wound on its right knee.

Xu Yunfan pressed his advantage without mercy. The fascia of his foot arch trembled continuously like an earthworm turning over. The Steel Tempered Body twisted at an angle that defied common sense, and the hammer wind transformed into nine afterimages of a red serpent, sealing off all paths of retreat.
