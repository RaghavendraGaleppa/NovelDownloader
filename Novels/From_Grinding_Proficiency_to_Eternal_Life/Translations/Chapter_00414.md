# Chapter 414: Schemed Against, But Still Useful

At this point, a faint smile curled at the corners of Chu Chengnan's lips. "Who would have thought that the righteous leader of the Wansheng Sword Sect would also be so indiscriminate in killing innocents?"

Li Qingling let out a cold snort. The Sword Heart Seal on her forehead flared with light, and the sword qi around her grew as sharp as frost. "Indiscriminate killing? This flood dragon's past sins were heavy. It was fated to die by my hand in this life. Where is the wrong in that? In fact, I am helping it achieve liberation."

Chu Chengnan shook his head with a wry smile. Most of these sword cultivators were obsessive characters. Once they condensed their so-called Sword Heart, most of them became impossible to reason with.

He said no more. With a gentle sweep of his sleeve, the ice plain beneath his feet trembled. The power of the earth's veins surged, as if an invisible mountain was rising from the ground, completely suppressing Li Qingling's sword intent.

Li Qingling's willow-like brows shot upward. A long sword flew out from her sleeve with a sharp ring, extending three inches. The words "Cheng Tian" on the blade's spine glowed with a piercing cold light.

The ice crystals beneath her feet spread out like a spider's web. Her three thousand black strands of hair moved without wind, and the tip of every single strand was condensed with fine strands of sword aura.

Chu Chengnan, however, stood with his hands behind his back. Under his dark python robe, the faint shadows of a hundred mountains flowed.

His voice was like the clash of metal and iron. "Daoist Li, the ink of the 'Cold Crow Agreement' from three years ago has not yet dried. The esteemed elder of your sect personally branded a sword seal on the alliance pact."

This sentence was like a basin of ice water poured over the tense atmosphere.

Li Qingling's sword finger paused slightly. Back then, the righteous and demonic paths had fought a bloody battle at Cold Crow Pass for a hundred days. In the end, the Wansheng Sword Sect won by a slim margin, forcibly snatching a blessed land from the Tiger's Mouth of the Primordial Origin Sect. For this, a total of four Core Formation experts from both sides were sent to reincarnation. This was what allowed the two sects' Nascent Soul experts to establish a temporary "Pact of Cessation."

"The demonic cultivators are bloodthirsty and insane. How could they possibly keep an agreement?" she sneered. Though her words were full of mockery, the sharp, piercing aura radiating from her sword gradually faded.

"When the next dispute over the界天 (World Realm) arrives, I will surely settle this karma with you."

She transformed into a streak of sword light and tore through the sky, the residual sword qi in the heavens splitting the clouds in two.

In the snowstorm, Chu Chengnan stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze profound.

"The True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture..." he murmured to himself, a meaningful arc curling at the corner of his mouth. "Interesting."

***

Three days later, on the frozen wasteland, at the bottom of the North Xuan Ice Abyss.

Xu Yunfan stared intently at a constantly pulsing wisp of Heavenly Gang Qi in front of him.

He naturally knew someone had stopped Li Qingling.

Yu Congling's voice, like a cold spring striking stone, was exceptionally clear in the dark abyss. "You've been schemed against."

Xu Yunfan's face turned grim. The Golden Light of his Martial Dao Heavenly Eye flared at his brow, and countless fine streams of information reflected in his pupils. The traces of the battle from three days ago flashed before his eyes like a revolving lantern.

The joints of Xu Yunfan's fingers cracked audibly as he clenched his fists.

These scattered clues, when pieced together, outlined a meticulously woven net. From the moment he stepped out of the Divine Martial World, someone had laid out this chess game spanning both the righteous and demonic paths, and he was the prey within it. Once his foundation ripened, it would likely be time for the harvest.

He suddenly let out a cold laugh. "So from the moment I stepped out of the Divine Martial World, I became a pawn for someone?"

"A Core Formation expert manipulates karma as easily as looking at the lines on their palm. Once one reaches Core Formation and steps onto the true path, it is a completely different world from Qi Condensation."

Yu Congling's voice drifted out from the Spatial Bag.

"They only need to place a casual stone in the span of a thousand years..." Yu Congling's voice chimed softly from within the Spatial Bag, "like a venomous spider spinning its web. When you reach the edge of a cliff, someone will naturally give you a gentle push."

She paused, her voice growing even colder. "When the Divine Martial Expert reincarnated to cultivate anew, how many eyes were watching? Those Core Formation experts are all shrewd individuals. Who wouldn't guess that he might reincarnate into the Divine Martial World?"

"This True Martial position is coveted by many. Even if they don't use it themselves, refining it would bring great benefits. They naturally know the Divine Martial Expert wants to reclaim the position in the Divine Martial World and step into Core Formation again..." Yu Congling let out a rare cold laugh. "They might even use the world's fortune to advance further, reaching late-stage Core Formation. Such a temptation is enough to make those people scheme and plot."

"In other words..." his voice was calm, without any fluctuation, "no matter who it is, as long as they obtain the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture and walk out of the Divine Martial World..."

With every word he spoke, a new fissure split open in the ice abyss. "...whether it's me, this accident, or the true protagonist, the Divine Martial Expert..."

"They will all become living pieces on the chessboard," Yu Congling finished, her voice carrying a rare solemnity. "The only difference is whether you are a pawn that stumbled in by accident, or the king's chariot they've been waiting for a thousand years to exchange."

Damn it, these people are simply inhuman, even a bit insane.

"The Divine Martial World..." Yu Congling's voice suddenly became ethereal, "perhaps it still hides secrets that even Core Formation experts would covet. Back when the World Realm was contested, three Nascent Soul experts took a stand: the Yuan Demon Sect, the Wansheng Sword Sect, and the Bodhi Pure Land... In the end, the Yuan Demon Sect won the top prize, seizing the person blessed with the world's spiritual essence from the original Divine Martial World and taking this World Realm."

"If it weren't for the World Realm's will排斥 (repelling) beings above Core Formation, experts would have long since不惜代价 (spared no cost) to forcibly enter the World Realm to seek their own opportunities."

The ice abyss suddenly trembled. Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered as he quickly suppressed his chaotic thoughts. He stomped his foot, shattering the ancient ice beneath him.

Black qi seeped out from the cracked ice fissures, rapidly transforming into a wisp of Heavenly Gang Qi that resonated with the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture within his body.

This was indeed True Martial Heavenly Gang.

In the world, Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiends are divided into thirty-six Heavenly Gangs and seventy-two Earthly Fiends. They are the transformations of the world's origin and the foundation for cultivators to prove their Dao.

Heavenly Gangs are pure, ethereal qi, corresponding to the celestial stars above and aligning with the dragon veins of mountains and rivers below.

The thirty-six Heavenly Gangs each have their own wonders. For example, the "North Pole Heavenly Gang" governs slaughter; after refinement, one's true qi becomes like a frosty blade. The "Purple Micro Heavenly Gang" governs fortune, capable of changing one's fate and avoiding calamities. The "True Martial Heavenly Gang" contains the true meaning of the Black Tortoise subduing demons and is most effective against evil spirits.

Legend has it that if one can gather nine types of Heavenly Gangs, they can trigger the "Nine Celestial Bodies in a Row" phenomenon. Celestial stars would pour into the body, allowing one to achieve sainthood through physical cultivation, making it highly sought after by body cultivators.

Earthly Fiends, on the other hand, are heavy, turbid, and yin-natured, mostly hidden in earthly veins,熔狱 (molten prisons), or ancient battlefield ruins. Among the seventy-two Earthly Fiends, the "Karmic Fire Earthly Fiend" burns the soul and corrodes the bones, the "Xuanming Earthly Fiend" freezes vitality, and the "Subduing Demon Earthly Fiend" specifically breaks a cultivator's foundation.

There are also unique Earthly Fiends like the "Blood River Earthly Fiend," which requires the slaughter of a hundred thousand living beings to condense a single thread within a sea of blood.

In addition, there are many other unique Heavenly Gangs and Earthly Fiends. The "Starfall Heavenly Gang" is carried by meteors from outside the realm and can be used to forge divine weapons. The "Nine Nether Earthly Fiend" must be collected at the entrance to the Yellow Spring and can connect Yin and Yang.

Cultivators often choose which to refine based on the characteristics of their cultivation methods. For example, the *True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture* requires the combination of the "True Martial Heavenly Gang" and the "Subduing Demon Earthly Fiend," yin and yang reinforcing each other, to condense the Divine Martial Foundation in the Dantian.

"Since the other party dares not confront me head-on and even specifically sent someone to stop Li Qingling..." He reached out and grasped the wisp of Heavenly Gang Qi with its dark black and golden patterns, letting it wrap around his arm like a living snake. "...it means this pawn of mine is not yet ready to be discarded."

Xu Yunfan understood in his heart. The other party was encouraging him to cultivate. The final moment had not yet arrived.
