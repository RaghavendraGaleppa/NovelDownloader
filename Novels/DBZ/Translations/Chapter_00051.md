# Chapter 51: Already Marked for Death

Before Bai Fugui could make introductions, the elderly scholar in Confucian robes spoke up first. "This humble one is Gongyang Yan, an enthusiast of literature and epigraphy."

The burly man followed with a gruff voice, "I'm Tie Xiangguang, an artifact smith."

"Wei Qian, alchemist," Wei Qian introduced himself simply.

As they were all strangers, exchanging names for basic courtesy sufficed.

Gongyang Yan stroked his beard cheerfully. "Brother Wei's arrival is most fortuitous. The burden on these old shoulders has lightened considerably." Before Wei Qian came, the elder had been responsible for appraising medicinal pills. Now he finally had a replacement.

Wei Qian's timing proved impeccable—the next item brought for appraisal was precisely a bottle of pills. When the stopper was removed, a heavy metallic scent of blood wafted out. The pills inside were broad bean-sized with dark red surfaces.

Frowning, Wei Qian looked toward the item's owner—a figure completely shrouded in black robes, only his eyes visible beneath the hood. Noticing Wei Qian's gaze, the man demanded, "What? Is there a problem with these pills?"

"The pills are genuine," Wei Qian confirmed first, then continued, "But these are Bloodburn Pills, aren't they?"

The atmosphere in the side hall shifted instantly. These were demonic path pills, infamous for their sinister refinement process requiring a mixture of cultivator and mortal essence blood as a catalyst. With demonic cultivators running rampant in recent years, the origin of these pills...

"Hah! I killed a few worthless demonic whelps and took these from their corpses," the robed man retorted. "Does your auction house refuse to accept them?"

Silence fell as all eyes turned to Bai Fugui for the final decision. Surprisingly, the bold auctioneer ultimately registered the Bloodburn Pills into the catalog. "Hahaha! Now that's vision!" the robed man laughed heartily. "With this attitude, your auction will surely thrive!" Satisfied, he strode away.

Fortunately, such incidents were rare. The subsequent pills submitted for appraisal were all conventional varieties. Wei Qian meticulously examined each, categorizing and recording them properly. With his assistance, the appraisal work progressed much faster.

Wei Qian shared the elderly scholar's love for books. Beyond pills, he could also provide insights about other auction items, much to Gongyang Yan's delight—the elder nearly considered him a kindred spirit.

The side hall witnessed a parade of cultivators presenting bizarre items one after another. "Lot 110... Lot 112..." As the appraisers worked, Ziluo Xianzi observed closely, documenting each item's details. A skilled auctioneer needed thorough knowledge of the merchandise to stir bidders' enthusiasm and "guide" prices upward during the actual event.

"Lot 115—Blackcrested Golden Eagle egg." Ziluo Xianzi examined the egg with its alternating black and gold stripes but found herself unfamiliar with this particular spirit beast. She turned expectantly to Gongyang Yan and Wei Qian for expert opinions, only to find both frowning deeply as if witnessing something unbelievable. Even the usually silent artifact smith Tie Xiangguang couldn't hold back.

"Friend, this is no joking matter!" Tie blurted out. "Blackcrested Golden Eagles are superior-bloodline spirit beasts—fully grown, they reach second rank, comparable to human Foundation Establishment cultivators. Even in Blackscale Immortal City, such an egg would qualify as a finale treasure. No one here could afford its true value."

His explanation made even Ziluo Xianzi—who knew nothing of spirit beasts—realize the egg's extraordinary worth. She might not understand beasts, but she comprehended Foundation Establishment cultivators perfectly! Any immortal sect or cultivation clan would gladly pay thousands, even tens of thousands of spirit stones for such an egg!

"Indeed, it appears genuine," Wei Qian verified after cross-referencing ancient texts, finding all characteristics matching recorded descriptions of Blackcrested Golden Eagle eggs. However, he soon noticed something amiss. "The vitality within seems unusually faint."

After Gongyang Yan's confirmation, the elder delivered an even grimmer assessment: "Friend, this egg is dead!"

The owner flushed crimson. "Nonsense! There's clearly residual vitality! How can you call it dead? Look carefully—this is a Blackcrested Golden Eagle egg! A superior-bloodline spirit beast!"

Human spiritual roots have lower, middle, upper, earth, and heaven grades—spirit beasts follow similar classifications. Unfazed by the outburst, Gongyang Yan calmly countered, "A dying man still breathes too. Does that mean he isn't dead? With vitality this feeble, it could dissipate any moment. Calling this a dead egg isn't inaccurate."

The man persisted stubbornly, "But it's still a Blackcrested Golden Eagle egg—" Ultimately, Bai Fugui intervened, approving the egg's inclusion not for profit, but to leverage its prestige for auction publicity.

Time passed as Wei Qian and the others toiled through over three hundred lots. Finally finished, they dispersed to their respective residences.

Outside Residence 47 at Pingyang Lake's central island, Wei Qian was about to enter when a voice called from neighboring Residence 48: "Fancy meeting my neighbor here! My apologies for not greeting you sooner!"

Turning, Wei Qian saw the mysterious robed man who'd submitted the Bloodburn Pills. "Quite a coincidence indeed," he replied curtly before entering without further ado. Inside, he immediately deployed multiple alarm talismans—his new neighbor clearly wasn't benevolent company to associate with.

"I must acquire that Golden Light Array at the auction," Wei Qian mused. "With it, I could secure my courtyard against such situations."

Meanwhile, the robed man's eyes gleamed with sinister malice as Wei Qian's door closed. "Daring to ignore me? You've already marked yourself for death!"
