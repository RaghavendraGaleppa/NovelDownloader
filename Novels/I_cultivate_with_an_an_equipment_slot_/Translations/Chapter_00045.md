# Chapter 45: Seeking Shelter  

"I have full confidence in your abilities," Zhuge Wan said to Zhang Yan.  

This was only natural.  

Everything Zhang Yan knew had been learned from her spiritual plant cultivation set—he was practically a carbon copy of Zhuge Wan. Thus, she held high expectations for him, hoping he would make a name for himself in the upcoming competition.  

As for Zhang Yan, he was more than happy to participate in a contest that carried no real danger yet promised substantial rewards.  

Most importantly, he was brimming with confidence about winning.  

Not necessarily in his own skills…  

But in Zhuge Wan's.  

After all, as a Golden Core elder, spiritual plant cultivation was her specialty—there was no way she could be lacking.  

After some encouraging words from Zhuge Wan, Zhang Yan was dismissed.  

When he returned to his thatched cottage, however, he was met with an unexpected visitor waiting outside.  

"Fellow Daoist Liu?"  

Zhang Yan looked at Liu Yiting in surprise.  

He had assumed she would be hiding within the Liu family, never expecting her to seek him out.  

What was even more surprising was that she was now dressed in Qingheng Sect robes.  

"Greetings, Senior Brother Zhang."  

Liu Yiting's face lit up with joy upon seeing him, and she quickly bowed in respect.  

"You've joined the Qingheng Sect?"  

Zhang Yan eyed her sect attire with astonishment.  

Generally, disciples from cultivation families were reluctant to join sects. Even if they did, they would start from scratch as new disciples.  

Moreover, unless the family was an offshoot of the sect itself, sects were usually unwilling to accept outsiders who had already been trained elsewhere.  

Someone like Liu Yiting, who had joined with prior cultivation, was a rare sight indeed.  

"Yes, Senior Brother Zhang. As you know, our family's situation is... complicated. Our patriarch has passed away, and our elder's lifespan is nearing its end. To protect our family, we had no choice but to offer our secret techniques to the sect."  

As she spoke, Liu Yiting's eyes reddened slightly.  

Zhang Yan could only offer a sympathetic sigh.  

The world of cultivation was harsh.  

Without a Foundation Establishment cultivator to protect them, the Liu family was doomed to decline—or worse, be swallowed by their former enemies.  

They had only just managed to nurture Liu Changfeng, and now they lacked the resources to cultivate a second Foundation Establishment expert.  

In such dire straits, their only option was to seek refuge with the Qingheng Sect.  

By offering their family's secret techniques, they secured the sect's protection.  

"By the way, Senior Brother Zhang, the reason I came to find you is that our elder wishes to meet with you."  

"Very well. I assume Elder Liu is already within the Qingheng Sect?"  

Zhang Yan wasn't the least bit surprised by the request—it was as if he had anticipated it.  

"Yes, Elder Liu is here. Since you're willing, I'll inform him to come see you."  

Pleased by his agreement, Liu Yiting quickly relayed the message.  

Elder Liu arrived swiftly.  

Before long, he stood outside Zhang Yan's residence.  

Within the small courtyard, Zhang Yan activated a barrier formation to block out prying eyes.  

"Fellow Daoist Zhang, it's been a while. Your cultivation has grown even more refined," Elder Liu said, his tone deferential despite his higher cultivation.  

"Elder Liu, you remain as formidable as ever. But I suspect you're not here just to reminisce?" Zhang Yan motioned for Elder Liu and Liu Yiting to take a seat while pouring tea.  

"Since we're already acquainted, Elder Liu, feel free to speak plainly."  

"Since you're so direct, I won't mince words either." Elder Liu took a deep breath before continuing, "Tell me, Fellow Daoist Zhang—do you lack spirit stones?"  

"Who doesn't lack spirit stones?" Zhang Yan chuckled.  

"Our Liu family is willing to offer you five thousand spirit stones." Elder Liu's gaze was piercing.  

"And what would you ask in return?" Zhang Yan remained unfazed—he had anticipated this move.  

Elder Liu was the Liu family's sole Foundation Establishment cultivator, but his lifespan was nearly exhausted.  

Though they had secured the Qingheng Sect's protection by surrendering their secret techniques, the sect would only ensure their survival—not their prosperity.  

Once Elder Liu passed away, without a strong voice to advocate for them, the Liu family would be left vulnerable to even minor troubles.  

Thus, Elder Liu needed to secure a future for his family before his time ran out.  

And Zhang Yan was one of the candidates he had chosen.  

Though Zhang Yan was only at the early Qi Refining stage, he was the personal disciple of a Golden Core elder—his potential was limitless.  

More importantly, his character was commendable.  

During their previous crisis, he had protected Liu Yiting despite the danger.  

Another cultivator might have abandoned her as a distraction, but Zhang Yan had carried her to safety.  

Considering all this, Elder Liu was willing to place his bet on Zhang Yan.  

*Tap, tap, tap.*  

The small room fell into tense silence.  

Zhang Yan, despite being only at the early Qi Refining stage, sat calmly in the host's seat, his fingers lightly drumming the table.  

Meanwhile, Elder Liu, a Foundation Establishment expert, watched him with nervous anticipation.  

"I understand Elder Liu's intentions. However, if a situation arises that even I cannot handle, I won't be able to intervene."  

"Naturally. If such a situation occurs, our Liu family will accept our fate."  

Pleased by Zhang Yan's response, Elder Liu's expression brightened.  

"As for the spirit stones, they won't be necessary."  

"However, my master has granted me a hundred acres of high-grade spiritual farmland. I need help converting it into a spiritual herb garden and acquiring some medicinal seeds."  

Zhang Yan declined the spirit stones, instead proposing an alternative arrangement.  

"These high-grade spiritual fields... are yours?"  

Elder Liu was visibly shocked.  

He hadn't expected Zhang Yan to receive such a generous gift from Zhuge Wan so soon.  

Clearly, Zhang Yan held far greater importance in her eyes than he had imagined.  

"Very well. Leave it to our Liu family."  

Transforming a hundred acres into a spiritual herb garden would cost far more than five thousand spirit stones—not to mention the additional expense of medicinal seeds.  

But now that he understood Zhang Yan's standing, Elder Liu agreed without hesitation.  

However, he made one additional request—for Liu Yiting to remain by Zhang Yan's side.  

Elder Liu's calculations were shrewd.  

As the personal disciple of a Golden Core elder, Zhang Yan's future was bright. Even if Liu Yiting served merely as a maid, she would still have a secure position.  

After a brief pause, Zhang Yan smiled.  

"As long as Miss Liu agrees, I have no objections."  

"I defer to Elder's arrangements."  

Liu Yiting's cheeks flushed slightly, but she did not refuse.  

"Excellent! In that case, I'll immediately arrange for the work to begin."  

Overjoyed, Elder Liu promptly set about organizing the labor.  

"Then I'll trouble Elder Liu with this matter."  

Zhang Yan's gaze lingered on Liu Yiting's delicate features and rosy cheeks as he chuckled softly.
