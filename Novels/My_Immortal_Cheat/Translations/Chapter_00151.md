# Chapter 151: Apologizing Again

Zhou Tian nodded. Although there were many things he still didn't understand, especially since it involved several Great Worlds, he generally grasped the main points.

"By my calculations, the time is almost up," the King of Gods said. "In these final moments, I encountered an interesting mortal like you to alleviate my boredom. The restrictions on the Pantheon will soon open. Then, we'll see who was right."

The King of Gods stood up and waved his hand. The void before them shifted again, and a familiar scene appeared before Zhou Tian: the interior of the Pantheon.

"You, old man, are truly interesting," Zhou Tian retorted. He also stood up, looking at the Pantheon alongside the King of Gods.

***

Outside, in the Ninth Heaven, Zhou Changsheng's cyan-gold armor was covered in cracks, and the arm guard on his right arm was completely shattered. A deep, bone-visible wound on his arm emanated golden light, but a strange energy prevented his body from self-healing. This was a wound inflicted by the Lord of Holy God, who left behind his unique energy.

The Lord of Holy God was not faring well either; his white robe was tattered, and since he was possessing a female body, large areas of skin were exposed. However, those present were all ancient monsters, and none paid attention to such details. Wei Chuan's grandfather had a pair of crimson wings unfurled behind him, and two fangs protruded from his mouth. His bloodline was unique, and this was his strongest form, but due to severe prior injuries, he could only unleash less than half of his full power. The other combatants also bore various injuries, the most severe being a deity from the Divine Realm whose arm had been severed and was now replaced by a swirling green vortex.

Zhou Changsheng held a small gourd in his hand, its light dazzling. Purple-gold radiance flowed within it, reminiscent of the passage of time, and its mouth exhaled chaotic qi. Though only palm-sized, Zhou Changsheng's arm bulged with veins, even trembling slightly, as if he were holding an ancient divine mountain. Everyone's gaze was fixed on the small gourd, for it was just moments ago that it had slightly tilted its mouth and absorbed hundreds of thousands of Divine Kingdom Sacred Spirits.

"A Heavenly Venerate artifact?" the Holy God muttered, his brow furrowed, a glimpse of pink skin revealed on his chest, a detail he utterly disregarded.

"A *partial* Heavenly Venerate artifact," Death God added. "Otherwise, he would have been instantly drained dry." His scythe already had a chip, and his arm was nearly withered, all qi and blood drained. Just now, when he struck the small gourd, he suffered a backlash himself; had he not pulled back quickly, his current body would likely have been destroyed.

"The depths of my Jiuzhou's foundation are beyond your imagination!" Zhou Changsheng declared, shining like a brilliant sun as he poured all his energy into the small gourd.

"Woo!" The purple-gold gourd body shook, emitting a wailing sound like a ghostly sob, making one feel intensely uncomfortable, their emotions severely disturbed. A terrifying phenomenon occurred: the small gourd shook, beginning to "whale-drink," devouring all the Sacred Spirits on the battlefield. One after another, brilliant lights flew towards it—these were the Sacred Spirits of various deities. Moments ago, those Sacred Spirits had been spread across mountains and plains, but now they were being swallowed, entering the small gourd at incredible speed. One must know that these Sacred Spirits, combined, were enough to shatter swathes of stars, yet now they were easily consumed, forcibly taken by the small gourd.

The pressure on Jiuzhou's side greatly alleviated. The endless onslaught of Sacred Spirits had been difficult for them to resist. Zhou Xunchuan and the others had long stopped hunting individually, instead staying deep within the army formations, waiting for opportunities to strike. The small gourd floated slightly, a single rune on its body faintly glowing. There were dozens more such runes, and it intensified its efforts, even drawing Sacred Spirits from within various deities' Divine Kingdoms through their projected forms.

"How dare you!" the Lord of Thunder roared, exchanging glances with the Holy God and Death God. Three streams of energy combined to form a special symbol, and a golden ancient spear slowly materialized. The spear's light was too dazzling, its golden luster illuminating past and present. It had once drunk the blood of a Heavenly Venerate, its divine might unparalleled.

"The Divine King's Spear!" Zhou Changsheng's eyes narrowed. He had seen this spear in ancient texts, though its specific name was unknown to him. It was once the weapon of the King of Gods, hence he called it the Divine King's Spear.

The Holy God reached out and gripped the Divine King's Spear, his body trembling. Golden light emanated from his eyes, and the phantom image of his Divine Kingdom's Sacred Mountain reappeared, continuously transmitting energy. Only then did everyone clearly see that the golden ancient spear was only half-complete, specifically the half containing the spearhead. The Holy God made his move, lightly drawing a line in the air with the half-spear. An inexplicable power of rules emerged, severing the gravitational pull emanating from the small gourd.

Zhou Changsheng's gaze sharpened. The small gourd in his palm vibrated ceaselessly, suddenly growing larger than a mountain. Only then did everyone notice the dense, intricate cracks covering its surface. The glittering symbol on the gourd's body was fully activated. The small gourd fiercely rammed towards the Holy God, shattering the cosmos, and the void emitted terrifying sounds, like vengeful spirits howling. The Lord of Holy God remained silent, but the golden light in his eyes intensified, as if he had transformed into an unrivaled monarch. He thrust the golden ancient spear forward with immense force.

*Clang!* Sparks flew, and the golden ancient spear erupted with ocean-like fluctuations. Its divine radiance instantly engulfed the sky, utterly terrifying, making one's soul tremble! The small gourd vibrated incessantly, humming as it shattered the void. On this Myriad Gods Mountain, Sacred Spirits and armies alike dropped to their knees, trembling and quivering, restrained by an unparalleled pressure that threatened to make them burst apart. This was already the result of Zhou Changsheng and the Holy God protecting them. Otherwise, a single strike from the two Heavenly Venerate artifacts, even incomplete ones, would have released enough residual power to destroy all these individuals.

Both combatants spat out large mouthfuls of blood. Before they could launch a second strike, the Pantheon suddenly erupted with dazzling light. Faint, ethereal chanting sounds arose, and the phantom figures of the gods appeared, just as they had on the day they first manifested. The restrictions enveloping the Pantheon slowly receded. Even the Lord of Holy God and the others showed excited expressions. They exchanged glances, then transformed into streaks of light, heading directly towards the Pantheon, abandoning the battlefield entirely.

Zhou Changsheng's expression changed. He had a bad premonition. Even if the Pantheon opened, it would only release some divine positions; the emergence of Heavenly Fate was still unknown, so there was no need for them to be so agitated. He put away the small gourd and followed closely, entering the Pantheon with them.

After Zhou Changsheng entered the Pantheon, he found that the Holy God and the others were already seated in their respective places. The Holy God was on the left of the first row. Although his body had become gigantic, making some exposed areas somewhat awkward, these details were ignored. He lifted the golden ancient spear in his hand, murmuring some ancient language. The golden spear emitted dazzling light, and runes emerged. As the Holy God continued to murmur, the phantom figures seated on the ancient thrones actually began to stand up one by one, turning their heads to look in Zhou Changsheng's direction.

Inside the space of the King of Gods' throne, Zhou Tian was slightly stunned. *This move too?* He had truly believed these things were merely divine position inheritances.

The King of Gods spoke, his voice like the morning bell and evening drum, deafening: "Mortal, it seems I have gained a slight advantage for now."
