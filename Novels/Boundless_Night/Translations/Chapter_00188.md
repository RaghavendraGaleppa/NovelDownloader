# Chapter 188: Pilgrimage

"Brother, we're not taking the immortal path, what are we going there for?" Wu Yaozu asked.

"The stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade!" Qin Ming said.

The Ascended Immortals Academy was in the adjacent district, renowned throughout the Kunling region. It exclusively recruited disciples of the immortal path, and only a limited number each year. It could be said that this was one of the top choices for brilliant talents who lacked background, participated in standard unified examinations, and ardently desired to embark on the immortal path.

"The Ascended Immortals District is truly impressive," Wu Yaozu exclaimed. In this area, some towering spires stood, seemingly piercing the clouds. It was said that during rainy days, they could draw lightning to collect "otherworldly heavenly light." Furthermore, golden mists could occasionally be seen streaking across the night sky in this area; even in the bustling downtown, such radiance was not uncommon. These were spiritual consciousnesses with a faint Pure Yang attribute, belonging to accomplished individuals on the immortal path whose spirits had left their bodies.

Wu Yaozu exclaimed in surprise, "Brother, quick, look over there! It's like a comet tearing through the night sky, piercing heaven and earth!"

Qin Ming's expression also grew solemn. In the pitch-black night sky, an extremely dazzling light pierced through the clouds and descended towards the ground.

"That's a senior at the Pure Yang level. Is he performing a spiritual journey, entering above the dark clouds to collect 'Heavenly Essence' and return, or is he refining himself with otherworldly heavenly light?"

"Judging by where he's landing, it's the Ascended Immortals Academy."

Nearby, many people looked up, seemingly unfazed.

Qin Ming watched, his eyes burning with desire, and sighed, "The methods of the immortal path are indeed extraordinary. It's truly free and unfettered, able to ascend to the nine heavens at any time to gather vital energy."

Beside him, someone else sighed, "Roam the North Sea in the morning, and Cangwu in the evening."

Wu Yaozu transmitted a message: "Our Rainbow Transformation path can also ascend. Brother, you don't need to envy them; your Heavenly Light energy can also leave your body, though currently you still need someone to pull you out. I estimate that once you reach the Outer Saint level, you'll be able to emerge on your own."

"Don't talk about that," Qin Ming reminded him, especially cautioning him not to speak carelessly once they reached their destination.

Although the Ascended Immortals Academy was located in the core urban area, it was characterized by undulating mountains and pervasive white mist, truly possessing the aura of an immortal's dojo. Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu entered smoothly without obstruction. Like them, many people from other academies had also come upon hearing the news. In this area, streaks of light frequently traversed the night sky; most of these were the spiritual consciousnesses of the academy's students.

"As expected of the top immortal path academy, strongly supported by the Extra-spatial Pure Land. This is a gathering place for geniuses," an outsider exclaimed in admiration.

In an open area, the ground was inscribed with runes, from which luminous mist occasionally rose. This was the Ascended Immortals Academy's arena, and today it was packed with people, because an esteemed senior was going to deliver a lecture here. Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu had arrived relatively early, yet the place was already teeming with people, and more were still arriving.

Little Wu muttered, "What's going on? Why are there so many people?" He felt he was almost being lifted off the ground by the crowd. What surprised him most was that many girls were incredibly excited, pushing forward vigorously, completely unafraid of being squeezed.

Someone asked in surprise, "Don't you know who's coming? Senior Sun Taichu, one of the leading figures of the Extra-spatial Pure Land, whose achievements penetrate the very mysteries of creation, he looks down upon the entire Night Mist World! He's personally here; who among those aspiring to the immortal path wouldn't want to come and listen to his teachings?!"

Wu Yaozu looked bewildered. He really wanted to ask, 'Who's this old geezer? Never heard of him!'

"Grandmaster Sun's cultivation is near-immortal, standing high on the clouds, overlooking the eight directions. He is the ultimate goal for our generation. We have admired him for a long time, and today we specifically came to pay homage!"

"All the disciples Senior Sun has taken have become pillars of strength on our immortal path, each stronger than the last. Even his youngest disciple is an immortal seed."

When people nearby mentioned Sun Taichu, their faces shone with reverence, showing his exalted status and terrifying strength. Everyone held him in awe and submission.

"His disciple, Cui Chonghe, is also here! It's said he achieved enlightenment at the age of three, a true near-immortal seed!"

When Qin Ming heard this, he finally understood why the name sounded familiar. He knew a senior would be coming, but he hadn't expected it to be someone of *this* caliber. He really wanted to leave, as this old man was truly terrifying. This was the man who dared to bang the table at Cao Qianqiu, one of the other renowned seniors in the Night Mist World.

Qin Ming tried to squeeze out of the crowd but realized that doing so would be very conspicuous, as immortal path disciples were continuously arriving, making it difficult to move against the flow.

"I estimate that everyone in Kunling City who has embarked on the immortal path has come, from disciples to seniors; no one wants to miss this."

"That's right, people from the Great Void Academy, Pure Yang Institute, and Feathered Ascension Dojo have also arrived. They are supported by the Immortal Land, Yang Land, and Ill-fated Land, respectively!"

In fact, it wasn't just them; many from the Newborn Path, Esoteric Path, and Aberrant Path had also rushed over, wanting to catch a glimpse of this world-renowned senior's immortal countenance.

"Everyone, spread out and sit on the ground; you'll all be able to see Grandmaster Sun." A streak of Pure Yang consciousness swept across the night sky, and a voice echoed in everyone's ears.

"Don't worry, Senior Sun will ascend into the void to deliver his lecture," another voice chimed in.

Finally, the place was no longer crowded. Many people had already waited for half an hour. Apart from Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu, who were impatient and wanted to leave, everyone else was filled with anticipation.

Suddenly, a grand fluctuation spread forth. The entire Ascended Immortals Academy became peaceful and serene, as brilliant golden mists rippled from the depths of the academy towards the night sky. Then, a golden sun slowly rose, its light illuminating the entire area. Many gasped; everyone knew Sun Taichu had appeared.

People saw an elder in a feather robe, his wide sleeves fluttering, ascending into the night sky. He was like an immortal being, radiating golden mists that overshadowed the numerous high-grade fire springs in the city.

"Even the scorching sun of old, traversing the sky, was no more magnificent than this! It truly feels like the heavenly sun has reappeared!" Even some veteran figures exclaimed in wonder.

Everyone knew this was not Sun Taichu's physical body, but his Pure Yang consciousness, which had transformed into a proportional human form, standing suspended in the air.

"It's rumored that Senior Sun has a youthful face with white hair, but since he emerged from seclusion, some of his white hair has turned raven black. As expected, his cultivation has deepened even further," an immortal path expert sighed in admiration. In the sky, the elder indeed had a mix of black and white hair.

"We have come for pilgrimage, to pay respects to Grandmaster!"

"Greetings, Senior Sun!"

Many knelt down, approaching him with pious hearts.

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu were speechless. Everyone else was kowtowing, and their standing out was a bit conspicuous. However, thankfully, many people in the distance were also standing or sitting on the ground. This was because many people from the Esoteric Path had also arrived, and it was impossible for them to kneel before a senior from the immortal path.

Sun Taichu's Pure Yang consciousness sat cross-legged in the night sky, illuminating the Ascended Immortals District as bright as day. He spoke calmly: "There's no need to bow to me. Our path speaks of approaching immortality and seeking truth; in the end, even immortals can be abandoned. Why worship an old man like me? To forge ahead in the Night Mist World, one must possess a fearless heart."

His voice was gentle, a complete contrast to Cao Qianqiu's style. If Cao Qianqiu were here, with a scarlet sun traversing the sky, the mere pressure naturally emanating from him would cause many experts to tremble incessantly. Sun Taichu's Pure Yang consciousness was only grand, not overbearing, nor did it oppress people, having restrained its terrifying fluctuations. Of course, he only mentioned it once and didn't stop those who insisted on kowtowing.

He first encouraged the disciples of the Ascended Immortals Academy, then immediately began his lecture. For a time, auspicious mists showered from the sky, the Dao韵 (Dao rhythm) was profound, and luminous characters continuously shone in the area, aiding people in comprehending laws.

"This old... Senior, is truly formidable!" Wu Yaozu sighed, swallowing the words "old geezer." He wondered if the ancestors on the moon could compare to this man.

Qin Ming secretly sighed. Sun Taichu recited true words, allowing people to resonate with the runes and enter a state of enlightenment. Such a method was truly extraordinary.

For nearly an hour, auspicious colors rained from the sky, fire springs gushed from the earth, and runic golden lotuses appeared in the void. The entire Ascended Immortals Academy was covered in astonishing divine phenomena. Many reaped significant gains. Problems that usually bothered them gained new insights in this grand environment. Qin Ming, however, felt nothing special, because he usually comprehended things quickly, and there was no particular improvement at the moment.

Exactly one hour later, Sun Taichu stopped. Many woke up and immediately cheered, "Thank you, senior, for bestowing the immortal dharma, which enlightened us."

A voice came from the golden sun in the sky: "This is merely the release of your own potential. If the immortal path is to travel far, you must clearly comprehend your true self."

Qin Ming's expression was grave. Sun Taichu was so formidable, sitting high on the clouds. How powerful had Cui Chonghe, who had been taught by him for over a decade, become now?

"Dare I ask, senior, has your personal visit to Kunling this time been to deal with that auspicious beast?" a middle-aged man, an expert from the Esoteric Path, asked.

Sun Taichu nodded and said, "Hmm, this is no secret anymore. There's a crisis on that plateau currently, and it's more than just one auspicious beast. As the saying goes, 'within crisis lies opportunity,' and for you all, there might be a chance to change your destiny."

Soon, people learned that the blood of that auspicious beast could accelerate the Pure Yang transformation of one's spiritual consciousness, allow the physical body to undergo nirvana, further enhance one's innate talent, and even extend life. It was a mature and potent wondrous blood elixir.

Sun Taichu smiled and said, "This time, multiple paths will advance together, and everyone will have an opportunity. We treat all equally; no matter which path you come from, as long as you accumulate enough merit in clearing the plateau, you can obtain the auspicious beast's blood. In fact, this is just a prelude to the Great Wilderness Expansion. Seize the opportunity!"

A woman, transformed from a high-grade aberrant, asked, "In the eyes of a near-immortal like you, senior, that plateau poses a great problem and is considered a crisis. Can we truly pacify it smoothly this time?"

"No worries, strong cultivators from all paths will arrive this time," Sun Taichu said.

"Excuse me, has Senior Cao Qianqiu arrived? I heard he was injured on Black and White Mountain; I wonder how he is now?" someone asked.

"What do you think my master would do? He will personally arrive!" In the night sky, a scarlet sun emerged. Although it didn't shake heaven and earth like Cao Qianqiu himself, it was quite domineering, causing many people's bodies to sway with fear. Cao Qianqiu's eldest disciple, Pu Heng, appeared, possessing some of his master's true essence. Everyone was extremely wary; this lineage truly didn't tolerate being gossiped about!

Pu Heng bowed to Sun Taichu. Facing this senior, he dared not show disrespect. Then, he looked at the crowd and said coldly, "Actually, our Pure Land lineage alone is enough. Everyone else is just making up numbers, idly hoping to get a share of the longevity blood."

"What are you saying?!" Another blazing sun appeared, somewhat peculiar, as it was heavenly light boiling, unlike the light of Pure Yang.

Pu Heng in the red sun was very aggressive. He said, "So it's the disciple of the old scoundrel Qingtian. How are you still alive? You're so old, with everything below your neck already in the grave, what are you doing out here!"

"Pu Heng, you want to explode, don't you?!" Qingtian's disciple shouted.

"Heh, I'm not just talking about your lineage; the entire Newborn Path is failing. Is your master waiting for the auspicious beast's blood to extend his life? And the Six Emperors are also about to lie in their coffins. Your path has no future, and it's finally coming to an end," Pu Heng laughed loudly.

Suddenly, a golden aberrant bird flew across the sky. On it stood a young man in rough linen clothes, his entire body radiating heavenly light. With a *boom*, he punched Pu Heng through the void.

*Pfft!*

The red sun formed by Cao Qianqiu's eldest disciple, which had been full of oppressive power, now developed cracks and then rapidly began to explode from one side. Instantly, a commotion broke out. People were shocked. With so many prominent figures appearing today, it truly felt like a pilgrimage for disciples from all paths!
