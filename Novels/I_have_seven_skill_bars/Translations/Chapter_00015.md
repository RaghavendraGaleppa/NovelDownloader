# Chapter 15: Attempts and Rewards

"I can understand that skills can fully execute cultivation techniques to complete true essence conversion, and it's incredibly smooth. But why is it so smooth even when I'm *not* using a skill? It's as if I'm still using one; in some places, the true essence even rushed through on its own?"

Ding Rui was puzzled.

Frowning, Ding Rui recalled the sensation he had just experienced.

"No, I have to try again!"

He closed his eyes once more, mobilizing his unaligned true essence and guiding it towards the lung meridians.

The result was the same as before. Although the repulsive force within the meridians was still evident, the true essence seemed to be self-navigating. In some simpler areas, it rushed through without Ding Rui needing to control it at all!

Then, in one go, the conversion was completed.

This completely exceeded Ding Rui's expectations, but he still couldn't draw a conclusion.

So, after testing the *Golden Radiance Art*, he immediately attempted the *Dewdrop Art*.

But this time, there was a problem.

With Ding Rui personally controlling the unaligned true essence to flow through the kidney meridians, he clearly felt resistance, unlike the smooth process with the *Golden Radiance Art*.

"If this method truly works, I should ideally keep all my cultivation techniques at the current Qi Condensation first level, not allowing them to advance any further, and then merge them all at once at the very end!"

"But how can I confirm that this method actually works?"

As Ding Rui pondered, his thoughts immediately turned to the *Dewdrop Art*.

"That's right, Brother Liu mentioned before, and it's also written in the secret manual given by Senior Brother Mu, that to cultivate simultaneously, the true essence intensity of both cultivation techniques must be exactly the same, with no distinction between strong and weak. Otherwise, the stronger one might affect the weaker one, and as the realms increase, this influence would become even greater, potentially even leading to death... So, I can completely use a skill to cultivate the *Dewdrop Art* to the same level as the *Golden Radiance Art*."

"Then I'll see if, after so many uses of the skill, the *Dewdrop Art* has also developed a habitual memory!"

Thinking this, Ding Rui acted immediately. He took out spirit rice, ate it grain by grain, lay on his bed, and leisurely began refining with his skill.

He continuously used the [Dewdrop Art] skill. The spirit rice he consumed transformed into the purest unaligned true essence, which was then controlled by the skill and converted into water-attributed true essence.

Ding Rui's *Golden Radiance Art* was already considered excellent at the first level of Qi Condensation, but it was still a considerable distance from the second level.

To advance from the first level to the second level of Qi Condensation, one must completely fill the acupoints and meridians that store the five-element true essence with the respective true essence.

He forcibly suppressed the excitement in his heart, preparing to run the *Dewdrop Art* himself, without using the skill.

Although he had cultivated all afternoon, Ding Rui felt as if he had only taken a slightly longer nap, even making himself a meal during that time. If he had continuously used the skill to cultivate without doing anything else, he probably would have genuinely fallen asleep from exhaustion.

Thus, Ding Rui felt no fatigue at all at this moment; on the contrary, he was full of energy.

He calmed his mind, controlled a portion of the unaligned true essence he had just refined from spirit rice, and guided it directly towards his kidneys, beginning to circulate it according to the *Dewdrop Art*'s route.

And this time, right from the start, Ding Rui noticed a difference.

Compared to his self-cultivation attempt that morning, this session was smoother to a degree he couldn't describe.

The unaligned true essence circulated rapidly along the *Dewdrop Art*'s route. Some simple minor obstacles were overcome by the true essence on its own.

And the larger difficult points were easily passed under Ding Rui's control.

A moment later, this wisp of unaligned true essence directly surged into the acupoints in his kidneys that stored water-attributed true essence, completing the attribute conversion.
