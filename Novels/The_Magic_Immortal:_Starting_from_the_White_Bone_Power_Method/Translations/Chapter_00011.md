# Chapter 11: Does Your Rejuvenation Needle Have Ten Artifact Restrictions?

The shopkeeper here had a distinctive mustache shaped like the character "八." 

In Wang Chan's memory, during his last visit, this mustachioed shopkeeper had been cornered at the entrance by someone accusing him of impregnating their dao companion. It was unclear whether the man was still alive now. 

Though the mustachioed man had a rather chaotic personal life, he was reliable in business—never substituting inferior goods or shortchanging customers.

"Oh? Daoist Wang, it's been over half a year! Please, come in!" 

Before Wang Chan could step inside, the yellow-robed, mustachioed shopkeeper emerged with a beaming smile, greeting Wang Chan as if he were a long-lost brother. He ushered Wang Chan inside and immediately called for premium tea, making him feel right at home. 

The tea was indeed excellent spiritual tea, and the pastries on the table were exquisite, their aroma tantalizing. 

Faced with such hospitality, Wang Chan drank the tea when offered and ate the pastries when urged—then proceeded to "accidentally" polish off the entire plate...

These pastries were *damn* delicious. Wang Chan couldn't help but crave more. 

Seeing Wang Chan devour all the pastries in one go, the mustachioed man's smile twitched. *Since when did Daoist Wang become so shameless? The [Eight Treasures Spirit Frost Pastries] cost one magic coin per plate—I bought them just for show! They’re meant to be smelled, not actually eaten...*

"Daoist Wang, are you here to buy Spirit Nourishing Elixir today?" The mustachioed man forced a smile, cutting straight to the chase. 

He had already decided that if Wang Chan’s purchase today amounted to less than five magic coins, he’d find a way to claw back half the cost. Otherwise, losing even a single coin would leave him tossing and turning all night.

"Out of stock?" Wang Chan countered.

"We have it," the mustachioed man said softly. "But the price went up half a month ago—now it's thirty spirit pearls per magic coin. Since you're an old friend, Hu here will take a loss and give it to you for twenty spirit pearls per coin."

Wang Chan stared at him silently.

"Can't be helped. When the higher-ups raise prices, we have to follow suit," the mustachioed man explained.

Wang Chan immediately excused himself to step out. 

The mustachioed man thumped his chest. "Feel free to check other shops, Daoist Wang. If you find it cheaper than thirty spirit pearls per coin, come back and tear down my sign."

After a while, Wang Chan returned—it was true. Some shops had even raised the price to forty spirit pearls per coin, truly gouging customers. 

Moreover, those other shops not only lacked pastries but also served inferior spiritual tea. 

There was no way around it. This was the only market within a thousand *li*. It wasn’t worth traveling three thousand *li* to another market just to save a coin or two. 

As for White Mountain City, it was ten thousand *li* away—completely out of the question.

---

With White Mountain City at its center, the surrounding thirty thousand *li* constituted its domain, all technically under its jurisdiction.

"Five bottles," Wang Chan said bluntly, wasting no further words. 

In the past, the original owner of this body had bought three bottles at most during a single visit, one of which was even for Old Man Zhang. 

Buying five bottles now was somewhat conspicuous for him, though not enough to invite malicious intentions. 

These were established shops—they wouldn’t risk their reputations for a couple of magic coins. It wasn’t worth it.

"Daoist Wang is decisive as always!" The mustachioed man’s eyes lit up, his smile turning more genuine. He promptly called for more premium tea and went to fetch the goods himself. 

Soon, after verifying the elixir’s quality, Wang Chan reluctantly placed six magic coins on the table and stashed the bottles in his storage pouch. 

As the mustachioed man collected the coins, he discreetly handed Wang Chan a flask of wine, grinning. 

"Hu here has recently brewed a new medicinal wine—[Golden Ant Strength Wine]. It’s even better than the [Tiger Bone Turtle Essence Seven-Leaf Wine], and I guarantee the backlash afterward is entirely manageable. Take it for a test run. If it works well, we can discuss further collaboration."

A flash of insight struck Wang Chan as fragmented memories surfaced. 

Now he understood the origin of the medicinal wine Old Man Zhang had been obsessing over. 

However, precisely because the [Tiger Bone Turtle Essence Seven-Leaf Wine] had such severe aftereffects, the original owner had cut ties with the mustachioed man after testing it a few times. 

Sabotaging one’s own reputation was unacceptable. 

Wait—if the side effects were that bad... did that mean Old Man Zhang was...? Well, never mind. He’d just have to offer free treatments later if needed.

*No wonder this shop is cheaper and more hospitable than the others. He was waiting to pitch this.*

Wang Chan kept his thoughts to himself but didn’t refuse the offer, accepting the [Golden Ant Strength Wine]. 

As a traveling physician specializing in rejuvenation and recovery, he was indeed the perfect distributor for such products. 

Seeing Wang Chan take the wine, the mustachioed man’s smile widened. He tugged at Wang Chan’s sleeve, insisting it was mealtime and he simply had to stay for dinner. 

Dinner was out of the question, but the atmosphere was amicable. Before leaving, Wang Chan seized the chance to casually inquire about low-grade demon bones. 

As for mid-grade or higher demon bones, he didn’t dare ask—it might arouse suspicion. 

A single mid-grade demon bone was valuable enough to drive people to desperate, reckless acts. 

The mustachioed man offhandedly shared some information, which boiled down to: low-grade demon bones were precious. No shops in this market bought or sold them—those transactions happened in White Mountain City.

---

Later, Wang Chan disguised himself, changed his name, and visited several distant shops to purchase ten more bottles of [Spirit Nourishing Elixir], spending another thirteen magic coins. 

It hurt his wallet. 

But what truly pained him was the talisman he secretly bought afterward— 

A Minor Earthwalk Talisman with eighteen restriction layers. 

This talisman started at three magic coins, with each additional restriction layer adding another coin. 

Twenty-one magic coins—non-negotiable. 

In times of danger, paired with a protective charm, activating this talisman allowed the user to burrow underground and escape—an excellent life-saving tool. 

Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. 

In the past, he couldn’t afford it and could only stare longingly. But now that he had the means, not buying one to stash away would leave him uneasy. 

If it went unused and he needed money later, he could always resell it without loss. If market conditions worsened and prices rose, he might even turn a profit. 

Consider it an investment. 

This perspective soothed Wang Chan’s heartache somewhat. 

"Talisman masters make *bank*. No wonder alchemy, artifact forging, talismans, and formations are the most prestigious professions in the cultivation world—they’re treated like gods of wealth wherever they go... Being a physician has no future. If I get the chance, I’ll switch to something more respectable." 

As he mused, Wang Chan made his way to the medical district. 

The medical area was arranged in a large circle. 

The crowd here was neither sparse nor dense, mostly composed of injured or sickly individuals. 

Some had lost limbs, others suffered from qi deviation, some were haunted by evil spirits, and others were simply overworked... 

The physicians operating here were also tiered. 

Mid-grade physicians typically occupied courtyards, often with pleasant scenery and low-grade physicians assisting them. 

Wang Chan recalled that the most famous mid-grade physician here was a dark, ugly scholar named Ning Jingming—a mid-stage Qi Refiner with over sixty strands of magic power. A righteous rogue cultivator, he occupied the largest courtyard, No. 1. 

His [Righteous Sun Spell] exorcised evil spirits, while his [Minor Life-Death Art] stopped bleeding, regenerated flesh, and even regrew severed limbs. His skills were exceptional, his character upright, and his reputation stellar. His earnings sometimes matched Wang Chan’s annual income in half a day. 

Of course, his expenses were also substantial. 

At the moment, Ning Jingming’s courtyard was abuzz with noise—something seemed to be happening. 

Physicians operating in plain houses were usually elite among low-grade physicians, having mastered at least one healing spell to twenty restriction layers or upgraded a healing artifact to twenty layers. 

As Wang Chan passed by, he spotted Daoist Tang from Cave No. 81 of Lotus Mountain sitting idly in front of one such house, flipping through a book. 

---

To be fair, Daoist Tang’s beady eyes and sleazy, greasy demeanor made him look anything but respectable. 

In contrast, the physicians in the adjacent houses were busy—clearly, they had customers. 

Wang Chan’s stall was a small thatched hut labeled No. 7. Though old, it was clean. The annual rent of two magic coins was far cheaper than his Lotus Mountain dwelling. 

About twenty such huts stood here. Most occupants were idle—some gathered to discuss cultivation, others meditated alone. A few familiar and friendly low-grade physicians nodded at Wang Chan as he arrived. 

He returned the greetings. 

Time passed, and soon it was nearing the end of the Hour of the Goat (1–3 PM). 

Unfortunately, even after reading most of *Travel Notes of the White Mountain Range*, Wang Chan still hadn’t received a single patient. 

Barring a miracle, today would be a wasted trip. 

Only because he still had magic coins in his pouch could he calmly read instead of fretting. Otherwise, he might have groomed himself and joined a few presentable female physicians in soliciting customers on the street. 

The original owner had earned five or six magic coins monthly, mostly from hustling for clients. 

"If no one comes by the start of the Hour of the Monkey (3–5 PM), I’ll head home early while it’s still light." 

Wang Chan made up his mind. 

Another cup of tea’s worth of time passed. 

Suddenly, a female Qi Refining novice rushed out of Ning Jingming’s courtyard. Her long braid gave her a pure, innocent appearance. After scanning the area, her gaze landed on Wang Chan, her eyes brightening. 

"Daoist Wang, does your [Rejuvenation Needle] have ten artifact restrictions?"
