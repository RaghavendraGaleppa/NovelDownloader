# Chapter 110: Wind Escape Technique  

Qi Condensation cultivation manuals, no matter how rare, would never exceed a hundred spirit stones in value—let alone a dual-element manual like *Wind Thunder Art*?  

Few could cultivate it, and even if they did, without the Foundation Establishment continuation, they'd have to switch manuals and start over.  

When the manager of the Hundred Treasures Pavilion saw that this *Wind Thunder Art* had been gathering dust in the shop for so long, only to have a Foundation Establishment cultivator show interest, he naturally beamed with delight and offered a discount, selling it to Lin Shan for just 30 spirit stones.  

Lin Shan sighed inwardly, then pulled out a blue magic sword from his storage bag—his former trump card, the mid-grade magic artifact "Frost Iron Sword" that had saved his life multiple times.  

"Could you appraise this mid-grade magic artifact for me? I'd like to exchange it for a wind-attribute mid-grade artifact."  

The manager's eyes lit up as he immediately took the Frost Iron Sword and examined it closely, praising it effusively.  

"This sword is truly a masterpiece among mid-grade artifacts! Three inscriptions, plus the rare ice-attribute spiritual material—it's worth at least 500 spirit stones."  

"Please wait a moment, Senior. Let me check our inventory in the back."  

The manager hurried to the back with the sword, leaving Lin Shan to rest and drink tea in the VIP area.  

Truth be told, Lin Shan had long considered replacing the Frost Iron Sword—not because it wasn't powerful, but because, once again, his skill tree had taken a wrong turn!  

The Enhancement Panel always surprised him, but the problem was that giving him an ice-attribute artifact meant he couldn't utilize it to its full potential.  

During past battles, the Frost Iron Sword's freezing effect had been negligible. Lin Shan's own spiritual energy couldn't maximize the artifact's properties—it was simply a mismatch.  

If he had a wind-attribute sword instead, wielding it would feel like an extension of his own arm, swift and seamless. Infused with his wind spiritual energy, wouldn't it be like adding wings to a tiger?  

This was also why he had never upgraded the Frost Iron Sword to a high-grade artifact.  

Another reason was that, as a Qi Condensation cultivator, he couldn't wield a high-grade artifact effectively. Now that he was in Foundation Establishment, high-grade artifacts had become standard equipment.  

As for why he came to the Hundred Treasures Pavilion first—when Lin Shan first arrived in Yi River, he had considered selling his low-grade artifacts, the Insect Nurturing Pagoda and the Refined Iron Sword, to the Artifact Forge. But the forge's owner had left him with the impression of a swindler.  

If the Hundred Treasures Pavilion didn't have a suitable artifact, he could always visit the forge later.  

---  

He didn't have to wait long in the VIP area before the manager returned.  

Not only did he bring back the Frost Iron Sword, but he also carried a long, narrow box, placing it on the table before Lin Shan with a smile.  

"Wind-attribute premium artifacts are quite rare. This is the only one we have in stock that matches the value of your ice-attribute sword. Please take a look."  

"If it doesn't suit your needs, we do have other wind-attribute artifacts, though their quality and functions may not meet your standards."  

The manager knew his clientele well. He had automatically filtered out ordinary low- and mid-grade artifacts. High-grade wind-attribute artifacts weren't what Lin Shan wanted, and this was the only premium mid-grade piece available.  

It wasn't that Lin Shan didn't want a high-grade wind-attribute artifact—he simply couldn't afford one with his meager four to five hundred spirit stones. Even if he sold the Frost Iron Sword, it wouldn't be enough.  

With only a year left before his overseas journey, he had to prioritize practicality. A premium mid-grade artifact would suffice—he could always enhance it later.  

Opening the box, he found a long spear resting inside, its tip gleaming coldly, its shaft wrapped in thick green fabric. Lin Shan lifted it, gave it a shake, and the fabric unfurled, revealing a majestic banner fluttering in the hall.  

**[Gale Banner]**  
Grade: Mid-grade Magic Artifact  
Description: Wind-attribute artifact. The spearhead is forged from Cloud Iron, the shaft from Cloud Wood. Features three mid-grade inscriptions: Sharpness, Spell Resistance, and Spirit Gathering. Only usable by wind-attribute cultivators.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

...  

"This Gale Banner is one of our finest mid-grade artifacts, combining offense and defense. It can also gather wind spiritual energy from the surroundings. In battle, it not only enhances the power of wind-attribute spells but also accelerates wind spiritual energy recovery."  

The manager explained in detail as Lin Shan nodded approvingly, admiring the banner with great satisfaction.  

The Gale Banner leaned toward being a versatile support artifact. With only one Spell Resistance inscription, its defense couldn't compare to his Cloud Copper Heart Mirror's five defensive inscriptions.  

Its offensive capability, with just one Sharpness inscription, also fell short of the Frost Iron Sword.  

As for the Spirit Gathering effect, the boost to spiritual energy recovery was merely average.  

But for a mid-grade artifact to have three effects was already impressive. Besides, Lin Shan planned to enhance it into a high-grade artifact later—who knew what new abilities it might gain?  

He already had a high-grade offensive artifact—the Five Elements Fan given to him by Lin Fan. What he lacked now was more combat versatility. The more effects an artifact had, the better.  

"Deal. I'll take this one."  

Lin Shan didn't haggle. In terms of value and rarity, the Frost Iron Sword was a pure offensive ice-attribute artifact, while the Gale Banner balanced offense, defense, and support. Lin Shan might have taken a slight loss, but it was only fair to let the shop profit.  

---  

Next, Lin Shan visited other shops in the city.  

At the Talisman Pavilion, his eyes immediately landed on the high-grade "Blazing Fire Talisman."  

He hadn't forgotten the power of Lin Fan's minor divine ability talisman, "Inferno Skyfire Talisman," which had turned the area within a mile into a sea of flames when they were pursued by Monk Xingtai, a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

A defensive specialist like Monk Xingtai had been instantly incapacitated. Any other Foundation Establishment cultivator would have been obliterated.  

If Lin Shan bought a high-grade Blazing Fire Talisman and enhanced it into a minor divine ability talisman, the effect wouldn't be far off. It could become one of his trump cards to turn the tide of battle.  

What he needed now were trump cards—the stronger, the better!  

But just as he was about to buy it, a thought struck him. Why not buy a wind-attribute high-grade talisman and enhance that instead?  

Fire-attribute talismans risked collateral damage. Back then, Lin Fan had used countless talismans, his Five Elements Robe, Lin Shan's Cloud Copper Heart Mirror, and the high-grade flying boat's defenses just to withstand the Inferno Skyfire Talisman.  

Even as a Foundation Establishment cultivator now, Lin Shan doubted he could endure it alone.  

What if he ended up incapacitating himself along with his enemy, only for a third party to swoop in and finish them both? That would be a joke.  

The shop assistant pointed out the wind-attribute talismans: Hurricane Talisman, Tornado Talisman, Flight Talisman, Wind Barrier Talisman, Storm Talisman...  

Wind-attribute talismans were rarer, costing twice as much as their counterparts.  

But what truly stunned him was what came next. At the back, he spotted a talisman he had only heard of in legends—one that nearly made him drool on the spot.  

**Wind Escape Talisman!**  

When it came to speed in the cultivation world, wind and lightning cultivators reigned supreme. Among them, Wind Escape and Lightning Escape Techniques were legendary, unparalleled in reputation.  

Wind Escape Technique emphasized vanishing without a trace. Once activated, the user merged with the wind, leaving no trace—effectively disappearing into thin air, making pursuit nearly impossible.  

Lightning Escape Technique, on the other hand, prioritized sheer speed—blindingly fast, covering vast distances in the blink of an eye, making it almost impossible to catch.  

Unlike these two, other escape techniques—Earth Escape, Water Escape, Wood Escape, Blood Escape—all had environmental limitations or personal costs.  

Unless one mastered legendary arts like the Immortal Wood Escape, Ten Thousand Miles Earthwalk, Divine Water Roaming, or Demon Blood Burst, ordinary escape techniques could easily be countered by powerful experts—such as turning earth to steel or freezing water to ice.  

But even so, among low-level cultivators, these techniques were virtually unstoppable in the right conditions. Ordinary rogue cultivators had no way to learn them—they simply weren't sold!  

If you wanted to escape, your only option was to buy talismans produced by a few major factions.  

Even within those factions, these techniques were notoriously difficult to master. Without top-tier comprehension, spiritual root aptitude, or unique physical constitutions, one could spend a lifetime failing to learn them. They were universally acknowledged as the hardest spells to master.  

"Is there anywhere that sells Wind Escape Technique spells?" Lin Shan asked, unwilling to give up.  

The shop assistant initially didn't want to answer, but seeing Lin Shan was a Foundation Establishment senior, he reluctantly replied, "Never heard of it."  

With that, Lin Shan had no more hesitation. He asked for the price of the Wind Escape Talisman—after all, such an item was a rare find. He had no idea how this shop had acquired it, but the next moment, the price left him dumbfounded.  

"1,000 spirit stones for a Wind Escape Talisman? A high-grade Blazing Fire Talisman is only 200!"  

"Senior, the Wind Escape Talisman isn't like offensive talismans—it can be used repeatedly. Moreover, when escaping, it leaves no trace, making it the safest escape method."  

"But unless you're a wind-attribute cultivator who can perfectly conceal your tracks, other cultivators will still leave traces when using it."  

"That's why earth- and water-escape talismans also cost over a thousand..."  

"..."  

Lin Shan was speechless. Now he truly understood how poor he was.  

The higher one's cultivation, the more expensive the associated items became. He had been poor during Qi Condensation, and now, even in Foundation Establishment, he was still broke!  

Without another word, Lin Shan turned and headed straight for the Yi River Auction House.  

---  

"You actually succeeded in Foundation Establishment?"  

Left True Person, a Golden Core cultivator sipping tea on the fifth floor, stared at Lin Shan in disbelief. If his old eyes weren't deceiving him, this kid was only twenty!  

Without the Foundation Establishment Pill he had promised, Lin Shan had recklessly attempted a forced breakthrough—and somehow succeeded!  

Should he call it audacity or heaven-defying luck?  

"Just luck," Lin Shan chuckled awkwardly.  

Left True Person took it seriously, stroking his chin and nodding.  

"The path of immortality is long. Innate talent is important, but comprehension becomes even more crucial at higher realms."  

"However, luck is the decisive factor!"  

"Some people waste half their lives, but when fortune turns, they soar to the heavens!"  

"Fate, opportunity—it's all ineffable!"  

...  

Left True Person swayed his head, lost in thought, as if recalling countless events from his centuries of life. The more he had experienced, the more he could understand improbable occurrences like Lin Shan's.  

In the vast cultivation world, strange and wondrous things happened every day. Succeeding in a forced Foundation Establishment breakthrough without a pill was astonishing but not unheard of.  

Now, Left True Person genuinely felt a desire to nurture talent. After all, Lin Shan's appraisal skills were freakishly high, making him an invaluable asset to the auction house's operations.  

Now, without any help, he had broken through to Foundation Establishment at just twenty, relying on "fortune." In the future, he might even have a shot at Golden Core!  

"Unfortunately, I've already married into a cultivation family. My legacy and assets are reserved for my descendants—I can't take on disciples anymore..."  

"If you have any needs, just ask."  

"From now on, the auction house will fully support your growth!"  

Lin Shan understood the implication—Left True Person was offering genuine recruitment, not just a simple employer-employee relationship.  

A flicker of temptation stirred in his heart, and he cautiously tested the waters: "Right now, I lack a Wind Escape Technique..."  

Left True Person froze, falling silent for a long while.  

"This..."  

"Wind Escape Technique is extremely rare. Very few sects in the Great Song Dynasty possess it. Neither my family nor the one I married into has such a spell..."  

"But if you join the cultivation family with me, you'll have access to all sorts of other spells."  

"Rogue cultivation is arduous. Having backing makes all the difference in your future progress."  

"If I hadn't joined a family back then, no matter how high my comprehension, I'd never have reached Golden Core."  

...  

Left True Person earnestly advised Lin Shan, much of it sincere guidance to help him avoid pitfalls.  

For most people, having a Golden Core cultivator vouch for their entry into a cultivation family would be a dream come true.  

But Lin Shan shook his head in disappointment. Compared to a cultivation family, the demonic Black Lotus Sect was far more promising.  

He had only asked out of hope—if Left True Person had the Wind Escape Technique, he might have traded enhanced treasures for it.  

But with no leads on the technique, the best Left True Person could offer was to bring him into a cultivation family as a son-in-law, just like himself.  

That would mean obligations and vulnerabilities, being tied to a family's fortunes. How could that compare to the freedom of roaming the cultivation world alone?  

Politely telling Left True Person he needed time to consider, Lin Shan didn't want to offend his employer while still under his roof.  

Left True Person understood. He, too, had once been a rogue cultivator—proud and ambitious, dreaming of reaching immortality through sheer will.  

But as he aged and suffered life's hardships, he had no choice but to bow to reality.  

In the end, he became the very "capitalist" he once despised—the dragon-slaying hero who turned into the dragon. It was inevitable, and he believed Lin Shan would one day understand.  

After patiently listening to Left True Person's advice, Lin Shan finally revealed his true purpose for coming out of seclusion.  

To borrow money!
