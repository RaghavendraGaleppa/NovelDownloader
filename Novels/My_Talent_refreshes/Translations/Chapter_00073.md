# Chapter 73: Yanji Market (Please Subscribe!)

Yanji Market was located on a branch of the Qingxi Mountain Range. Situated between the territories of two major sects and close to the mortal city of Yanyun to the north, this market wasn't particularly large but attracted considerable crowds during open days, which occurred every three days.

When Chu Ning and the others arrived, it was a closed market day, leaving the streets sparsely populated. Lin Changqing led the group to stop in front of several shops.

"These four shops were previously managed by different halls," Lin Changqing explained. "Each has a courtyard for residence. The restriction tokens can open them—take a look around."

With a wave of his hand, Lin Changqing distributed small restriction tokens to everyone, with Chu Ning receiving two. The Spirit Plant Hall naturally had a shop here as well. Although the Qingxi Sect only cultivated twenty acres of spirit fields in this area, the produce wasn't abundant. However, due to the high grade of the spirit fields and the correspondingly high-grade spirit plants grown, they could fetch a decent amount of spirit stones. Of course, the shop didn't solely sell products from those twenty acres—it also bought and sold various spirit plants and even operated as a rice store, sourcing spirit rice from cultivation families or the Qingxi Sect.

Chu Ning took the restriction token and glanced at the two shop signs: Qingxi Spirit Talisman Shop and Qingxi Spirit Plant Shop. He entered the Spirit Talisman Shop first. Since the shop had been in operation until recently, it was clean and tidy, though the shelves were now empty. After casting a few cleaning spells to ensure everything was spotless, Chu Ning moved to the rear courtyard.

To his surprise, the courtyard behind the shop was quite spacious—larger than his previous residence in the Ding District. The living quarters extended into an even bigger backyard. 

"It seems the layout was standardized," Chu Ning mused. "The Spirit Talisman Hall doesn’t need this much space, but the Spirit Beast Hall would. If they were raising Grey Spirit Rabbits or similar creatures, they’d require ample room. The Spirit Plant Hall would also need space for transplanting certain spirit plants."

He was particularly pleased to find that, despite the proximity to neighboring courtyards, some form of restriction isolated them, ensuring privacy.

After assessing the spiritual energy concentration in the area, Chu Ning grew even more satisfied. According to the information provided by the sect, this plot of land had the highest spiritual energy density in the region. Initially contested by the Qingxi Sect, Wind Valley, and several cultivation families, it was eventually turned into a shared market after negotiations. As a result, the spiritual energy here was even richer than that of the Qingxi Sect’s nearby spirit fields.

"I originally planned to plant Ironvine here," Chu Ning thought, "but with this level of spiritual energy, I can cultivate higher-grade spirit plants to aid my Woodspring Nourishment Technique practice."

Before he could ponder further, Lin Changqing summoned everyone back to the street. Standing beside Lin Changqing was a young man in his late twenties with a sharp, angular face and an upright posture. The man exuded a stern aura, and his sect robes identified him as a Qingxi Sect disciple.

"This is Du Han from the Enforcement Hall, at the ninth level of Qi Refinement," Lin Changqing introduced. "If you encounter trouble with troublemakers or dangerous situations, or if I’m unavailable and you need to report to the sect, you can seek his assistance."

After introducing everyone to Du Han, Lin Changqing added, "Chu Ning is also responsible for managing twenty acres of the sect’s spirit fields. Du Han, take him to familiarize himself with the location. I need to inspect other markets."

With that, Lin Changqing departed on his flying boat, leaving the group to bid him farewell. Du Han turned to Chu Ning. "The spirit fields aren’t far—just over ten miles away. Let’s go." Without using any magical tools, Du Han took off with wind-assisted flight, and Chu Ning followed suit.

Left behind, the remaining four disciples watched them leave. Luo Yiping, the male disciple from the Spirit Beast Hall, shook his head. "The Spirit Talisman Hall and Spirit Plant Hall must be really short-staffed to assign a fourth-level Qi Refinement disciple to handle both duties."

Shen Zhengquan from the Artifact Refining Hall chimed in, "I doubt the Spirit Talisman Hall has high expectations for business here. Wind Valley specializes in talismans—I’ve heard our market share in Yanji is minimal. Now..."

Lu Miaoying, the female disciple from the Spirit Beast Hall, asked curiously, "Since Junior Brother Chu is handling both, does he only need to submit one harvest quota?"

"Of course not," Luo Yiping scoffed. "He represents both halls, so he’ll have to submit two quotas. Honestly, I wonder if he’ll even manage to meet one."

Lu Miaoying stuck out her tongue in relief that she wasn’t in his position. Luo Yiping continued, "Whether he meets the quotas isn’t the main issue. Yanji Market is jointly managed by our sect and Wind Valley. If our side gets completely overshadowed, what will the cultivation families and rogue cultivators think of us?"

Shen Zhengquan frowned in agreement, while Gu Xiaoqing, the alchemy disciple who had remained silent, calmly remarked, "Perhaps Junior Brother Chu has unique capabilities."

"What capabilities could a fourth-level Qi Refinement cultivator possibly have?" Luo Yiping sneered, his gaze lingering on the two shop signs under Chu Ning’s charge, lost in thought.
