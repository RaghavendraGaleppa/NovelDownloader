# Chapter 419: She Has Never Been in Love!!

In the Little World.

"So... Big Brother Li is alright?"

Jiang Chulong sat on the ground, hugging her knees, asking nervously.

The Happy Lamb Hotpot Restaurant was extremely popular with martial artists from all directions and had now become a branch of the Ziyang Mansion's Jianghong Shop, making its intelligence network extremely fast.

Today, at the hotpot restaurant, a few swordsmen got dead drunk. For some reason, they found a brazier and started burning paper money at the entrance.

They cried while drinking.

They were crying over a single hair.

"Wuu wuu, your novel hasn't been updated yet!!!"

"Wuu wuu wuu, I toast to you. No one else can show off in front of others as well as you. How lonely it is to be invincible~~~ Wuu wuu wuu!"

"Gulp gulp gulp..."

"The first time I remember you was because I stepped on your watermelon peel. I watched your back disappear into the distance. I didn't expect our final meeting to also be your back!"

*Whoosh—*

A gust of wind blew from nowhere.

"Damn it, where did this strange wind come from?"

"Quick, pick it up!!"

"Be careful not to fall into the brazier, or not even a hair will remain!"

So, several drunken swordsmen chased a single hair everywhere, falling over and over again.

Even Princess Xiao Jiang couldn't help but step forward and ask about such a诡异 scene.

"Life is full of disappointments. You shouldn't be like this..."

Hmm.

Princess Xiao Jiang felt that the few of them looked familiar, so she couldn't help but comfort them.

But after she found out who they were mourning for, the atmosphere changed instantly.

"Little girl, please don't. Put the sword down."

"Do you even know where the Demonic Summoning Sect people are before you go to seek revenge?"

The scene became extremely chaotic for a moment.

Fortunately, when Jiang Chulong was at a loss, she remembered that her teacher had great powers and might have a solution.

So she came in and asked immediately:

"Teacher... can a person who is left with only a single hair... come back to life?"

The Heavenly尊 fell silent for a long time, completely stumped.

If he said no, it would make his image as a Heavenly尊 seem less valuable.

If he said yes...

The guy is literally just a single hair left!

After learning the whole story, Li Mo didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He could only comfort Princess Xiao Jiang properly.

"Rest assured, I can tell at a glance that your Big Brother Li has great fortune and a strong destiny. He is no ordinary person. If anyone tells you he's dead in the future, don't believe them."

"Really?"

"Of course it's true. Come on, practice your martial arts. Today, I will teach you a new sword art."

What the Heavenly尊 Teacher taught today was naturally the Dragon Slashing Sword Art.

Another hundred years or so of martial arts insights disappeared, but Li Mo didn't feel heartache.

Firstly, he has accumulated over two thousand years of martial arts insights now, so this bit is just a drop in the bucket.

Besides, once Princess Xiao Jiang practices the *Dragon Slashing Sword Art* to perfection, the investment feedback would definitely be better than martial arts insights, right?

...

An hour and a half later.

Jiang Chulong mastered this supreme sword art and challenged the Red Dragon again.

But after all, she had just learned the sword art. Using it against a legendary innate creature still left much to be desired.

After coaxing Princess Xiao Jiang to leave the Little World to rest, Li Mo finally began his own cultivation.

"There are quite a few Upper Form diagrams in the investment feedback."

"Although tempering the Heaven-Equal Fighting Will is not as good as one-tenth of the Ultimate Form, the advantage lies in the sheer quantity."

The martial arts world of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands is far deeper than he thought.

Originally, he had made a name for himself in the Southern Frontier, ranking in the top five of the Hidden Dragon List. He didn't expect that before he could feel proud, he would discover that what he saw was just the tip of the iceberg of this world.

The Great Yu Emperor sat by and watched the Southern Frontier be destroyed.

The gods and immortals of the Nine Heavens have awakened.

These are not illusory matters, but are closely related to the people around him, and to himself.

Time passed.

When Li Mo woke up the next morning, he happened to see the first ray of morning light outside the window.

---

Li Mo's brow was a bit swollen, as if he had been beaten up in a dream while sleeping.

Well, not just once.

Defeating five Upper Forms was his achievement from last night.

If he relied solely on Upper Forms, he would probably need at least sixty more. If the Heaven-Equal Fighting Will were placed on someone else, it would simply be a huge pitfall.

He turned his head and looked at the empty pillow beside him, but Little Li felt that the exhaustion was worth it.

Just imagine.

One morning, waking up to find the ice lump sleeping beside you suddenly looking at you like a stranger—how terrifying that would be.

Hmm, he should work harder.

But besides improving his realm, he should also make other preparations.

So Li Mo went downstairs and found Qin Yuzhi, who was reading books from the past thousand years in the courtyard, familiarizing herself with the work environment.

"Master Qin, is there a possibility that the Cloud Dream Fairy in your body could awaken again?"

"Huh? Not for the time being."

Qin Yuzhi shook her head, then muttered softly: "Why do you two ask me the same question..."

"The same question?" Li Mo was stunned.

"Yes, do you also want to ask how I prevented the Cloud Dream Fairy from awakening when there were signs of her waking up in my body?"

"Exactly..."

Li Mo realized that the other person who asked should be the ice lump.

Qin Yuzhi repeated: "Naturally, it's by doing things that don't fit the Cloud Dream Fairy's temperament."

"Can you be more specific?" Li Mo took out a small notebook.

"For example, the Cloud Dream Fairy likes playing Go and likes to have everything under her control, but I specifically play Mahjong, relying entirely on luck. You never know if your next hand will make the Eighteen Arhats."

Qin Yuzhi gritted her teeth when she mentioned the Eighteen Arhats.

She had only encountered it once in her life. Even if it was in a dream, she didn't get to finish that dream.

"Anything else?"

"For example, the Cloud Dream Fairy likes sleeping peacefully and leisurely, but I sleep only once a month and work overtime every day. I'll work her to death!"

"..."

Little Li leaned back slightly.

No wonder she could oversee the construction of such a complex and massive Cloud Dream Underground Palace. What kind model worker demon sect leader... well, the Demonic Summoning Sect wasn't considered a demon sect back then. If anything, it was an iron rice bowl...

"Playing Mahjong... Overtime..."

Li Mo fell into deep thought.

Qin Yuzhi shook her head again: "This is just a method to prevent the Cloud Dream Fairy. It might not be suitable for Ying Bing."

"Her situation should be different from mine."

"What do you know about the temperament and preferences of the Nine-colored Phoenix?"

Li Mo asked seriously.

Qin Yuzhi's mouth twitched, and she shook her head.

"Aren't you an ancient person?"

"You are separated from my era by thousands of years, and I am separated from the era of the Phoenix Ancestor by tens of thousands of years. Besides, even in the same era, how many people could come into contact with an existence like her?"

"And my memories are incomplete. Even if I know a tiny bit, I don't know when I'll remember it."

Qin Yuzhi clicked her tongue, looking at him as if he were an idiot.

Little Li genius crossed his hands and propped up his chin, looking exactly like a thinker.

Things that the Nine-colored Phoenix absolutely would not do.

No clue, absolutely no clue.

Should he start with playing Mahjong?

Wait!

Li Mo suddenly had a flash of inspiration.

He happened to remember that in the ice lump's dream, in the Ying Family Ancestral Hall, when the clan elders were performing the ritual, they once said.

The Ying Family was created by the Ying Family ancestors.

Yes, created, not descended...

So, is there a possibility!

"The Nine-colored Phoenix... has never been in love!"

"She... doesn't understand love!"

Li Mo slapped the table.

Qin Yuzhi's eyes widened, as if struck by lightning. She was so scared that she plopped down onto the ground.

"Bro, are you serious?!"
