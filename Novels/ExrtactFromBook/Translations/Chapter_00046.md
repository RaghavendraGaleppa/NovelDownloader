# Chapter 46: Second Perfection

At this moment, the [Invisible Sword] revealed itself in midair—a three-foot crystalline blade resembling glazed glass!

The hilt of this treasured sword was grasped lightly by a young man with ancient, unadorned features. His sudden appearance marked the arrival of the legendary figure who had reshaped the heavens—True Person Shi Xuan!

Holding the sword in his right hand, Shi Xuan swung it forward. Empowered by the immortal's mana, the [Invisible Sword] unleashed its most devastating strike yet!

A colossal sword aura surged toward the spatial rift, unstoppable in its advance. As it struck, the branches extended by [Granny Peach] were severed like torn cloth. The sword aura, undeterred, pierced through the rift and entered [Peach Blossom Mountain].

Within this paradise of blooming peach blossoms, the intangible sword aura transformed into a sky-covering blade, descending upon [Granny Peach] with a single, earth-shaking slash!

The strike sent tremors through the void of [Peach Blossom Mountain], shaking heaven and earth. Though [Granny Peach] resisted with all her might, she could only endure the blow before the nearby [Ape Demon] intervened with his spear, shattering the sword aura. A deep scar remained on the massive peach tree, refusing to heal for a long time.

[Peach Blossom Mountain], once a blessed paradise, was now in ruins from the battle between fourth-order beings, requiring years of restoration.

"Shi Xuan!" [Granny Peach] shrieked in fury as the spatial rift finally dissipated without a trace.

In the now-empty expanse, only Shi Xuan, holding his treasured sword, and Li Zihan, cradling a peach branch, remained. The [Invisible Sword] then transformed into a small, pigtailed child, standing nearby and watching their exchange with eager anticipation.

Shi Xuan spoke first:  
"Fellow Daoist Li, your bravery in facing such peril is truly admirable. As agreed, the peach branch and ape blood are yours. My task here is complete. Until we meet again."

Li Zihan scoffed.  
"Shi Xuan, stop pretending!  
You didn’t even try your hardest!  
If you had destroyed the rift first, the [Ape Demon] would never have escaped. The two of us could have trapped it here permanently!  
With your half-hearted effort, you still owe me a favor.  
And now, you owe me an extra fourth-order demon—don’t forget that!"  

Her logic was impeccable. Shi Xuan attempted to defend himself:  
"Fellow Daoist Li, since your ascension to immortality, you’ve already secretly slain two great demon sages.  
If these two demons had also perished today, the conflict between our factions would have escalated beyond repair!"  

Li Zihan dismissed his reasoning outright.  
"Shi Xuan, spare me your excuses. These lower-realm demons are nothing but parasites. Killing them changes nothing!  
You’re just afraid I’ll complete the [Four Spirits Cauldron] before you and surpass you!"  

Shi Xuan rubbed his nose and sighed.  
"Enough. What’s done is done.  
Fine—once I ascend to the void, I’ll repay you with a fourth-order heavenly demon.  
Invisible Child, please inform the Beast Taming Sect and the Green Lotus Sword Sect about today’s events.  
Since this area borders Guizhou, we’ll need their vigilance in case the demons retaliate."  

Li Zihan rolled her eyes.  
"Typical Shi Xuan, always passing the buck.  
Just remember—you owe me a fourth-order demon. Farewell!"  

With that, she flicked her finger, opening another spatial rift, and stepped through before it vanished.  

The Invisible Child turned to Shi Xuan.  
"Shi Xuan, your debts keep piling up."  

Shi Xuan chuckled.  
"Between old friends like us, what’s a little debt?  
There aren’t many of our peers left—it’s only natural we interact more.  
Go ahead and deliver the messages. I’ll return to the sect and await you."  

With that, both figures vanished in flashes of light.  

Thus, the battle between fourth-order immortals concluded without fanfare. The terrifying clash of power had left behind a vast crater and unleashed storms that rippled across the land.  

By the time the winds reached the Butcher’s Market, they had dwindled to a mere breeze. Among the bustling crowds of a million souls, how many could fathom the immense power and secrets carried by that gentle gust?  

Meanwhile, in Courtyard Nine of the Celestial District, Han Yue reached a critical juncture in his cultivation.  

His mana surged like a raging river, with 364 [Thunder Nurturing Runes] resonating within his meridians, emitting profound fluctuations of energy. The runes interconnected, forming a celestial cycle—yet one final rune was missing.  

Han Yue had been in seclusion for ten days, striving to manifest the last rune.  

Today, a sudden intuition told him: the second perfection of [Body Nurturing Thunder] was at hand!  

Soon, a small rune emerged, completing the 365-rune cycle.  

His mana circulation halted briefly before surging forward with unprecedented intensity.  

The second perfection of [Body Nurturing Thunder] was achieved!  

Han Yue’s mana capacity nearly doubled, and its recovery and circulation speed increased dramatically. He had advanced beyond the first-order Body Entry Perfection, now standing at the threshold of the second order.  

Reflecting on his journey, Han Yue recalled how it began with awakening [Thoughtless Slash], risking his life to slay demons and absorb high-tier divine mana, instantly reaching the first-order Foundation Establishment stage.  

His path had led him to the Butcher’s Market, where stability and resources allowed him to cultivate [Body Nurturing Thunder]. With the support of the [Heavenly Origin Treasure Lotus], he achieved its first perfection, elevating his two divine abilities to mastery.  

Now, after half a year of secluded cultivation, he had attained the second perfection, reaching new heights of strength.  

A sense of fulfillment and clarity filled him.  

No longer content to remain in the Butcher’s Market, Han Yue yearned to embark on his journey of seeking the Dao.
