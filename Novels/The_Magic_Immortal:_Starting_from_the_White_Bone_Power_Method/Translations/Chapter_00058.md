# Chapter 58: No Surprises Today—It's Time for a Big Show

"My humble self—"

This outer sect disciple of the Misty Cloud Sect had quite long legs. Had she already found a Dao companion at such a young age?

Wang Chan pondered silently before decisively saying, "I'll leave. But once outside, I won't be targeted, will I?"

Since the Soul Bell was already in his possession, his objective was accomplished. Staying here served no further purpose, and leaving early would be more convenient and safer. Moreover, even if some coveted treasure appeared later as the finale, he couldn't afford it anyway—better not to see it and spare himself the temptation.

"Rest assured, fellow Daoist. Please follow me."

The green-robed female cultivator, however, formed a hand seal toward the token in her hand, causing the entrance behind the private booth to open abruptly. She led the way, swaying her hips as she stepped into the dark passage.

Wang Chan followed closely behind her, entering the shadowy corridor. He had expected a straight path leading directly out, but they stopped midway.

The female cultivator reached into the darkness, grasped something, and gave it a firm squeeze. A strange sound echoed, and soon after, light flooded in—emanating from a hidden chamber.

The two entered the chamber.

Wang Chan glanced around and noticed two doors: one wide, the other narrow.

"Would the fellow Daoist like to continue exploring the black market or leave directly?" the female cultivator asked again.

"Can I leave the black market directly from here?" Wang Chan asked, surprised.

"Naturally."

"Then I'll leave."

Before parting, the green-robed cultivator produced a token adorned with cloud and mist patterns. "This is our hall's VIP token. Should you return to the black market in the future, you won't need to procure an entry token or pay the market fee. Nor will you have to struggle for an auction token—this will suffice."

Wang Chan eyed the token but didn't immediately take it.

"Fellow Daoist, rest assured. Given our hall's foundation and backing, we have no need for underhanded tricks." The female cultivator smiled confidently and explained, "Moreover, this token is standardized and anonymous. Whoever holds it can use it not only in the Youlin Mountain black market but also in other black markets across the White Mountain Range. It's also valid in the trading halls and auction houses of White Mountain City."

Hearing this, Wang Chan had a vague sense that the situation in the White Mountain Range was about to change dramatically. The Nascent Soul cultivator of the Misty Cloud Sect was far more formidable than he had imagined.

"In that case, I gratefully accept." Wang Chan took the token, inspected it briefly for any anomalies, and then, under the female cultivator's guidance, stepped resolutely through the narrow door and strode away.

Three days later.

Lotus Mountain seemed quieter than usual. 

As for whether Zhang the Hunchback had managed to purchase the low-grade formation array, Wang Chan couldn't say. But one thing was certain—the [Great Strength Golden Ant Wine] must have been completely consumed by now.

Zhang wasn't home, but Luo Bing, ever the rule-follower, kept to herself, rarely stepping outside. She busied herself tending to flowers and plants, tidying up here and there—likely just passing time out of boredom. 

Yet, whenever cultivators loitered nearby, she would instinctively sneak over to Wang Chan's cave dwelling, hiding beneath the crooked old tree and trembling as she whispered about her fear. Fortunately, her attire was modest and proper, devoid of any seductive airs, so she never stirred any improper thoughts in Wang Chan.

Wang Chan, meanwhile, sought out his fellow Daoist Iron Warrior and learned that among the troublemakers were three mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators—one surnamed Chen, another Wen, and the last Yu. With Iron Warrior's intervention, the matter was resolved.

Given the chaotic state of the wilderness, the cultivators of Lotus Mountain had recently banded together, forming patrol teams that operated day and night. Iron Warrior was one of the organizers. Armed with a mid-grade magical artifact and possessing mid-stage Qi Refining cultivation, he was a formidable hunter with considerable influence.

As for tenants who chose not to participate in the patrols, they were required to pay an additional two spirit coins per month—a far better deal than what the Black Eagle Gang had offered.

At the moment, deep within his basement, concealed behind layers of barriers, Wang Chan sat cross-legged in a medicinal bath, deep in cultivation. 

Outside the tub lay a pile of spirit bones. As he circulated his techniques to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy, the yin-tainted spiritual power within the bones surged into his body through his nose and mouth. Meanwhile, the faintly white medicinal liquid in the tub bubbled vigorously, thin silver threads seeping into his pores.

With the aid of the medicinal bath and the spirit bones, Wang Chan's absorption and refinement of spiritual energy became markedly more efficient. The swirling mist of spiritual energy around him was quickly devoured, only to be replenished anew.

Four hours later, Wang Chan emerged from his meditative state, a faint smile on his lips. 

The combination of spirit bones and medicinal bath had indeed significantly boosted his cultivation speed—nearly by forty percent, thanks to the high quality of both resources. 

He couldn't help but inspect his dantian internally. In just three days, four new strands of spiritual power had formed. 

At the sight, the excruciating pain of tempering his true bones and refining his spiritual power seemed trivial in comparison.

"At this rate, I'll reach mid-stage Qi Refining in about four years. With the right elixirs, perhaps even within three!" Wang Chan thought excitedly. "Once I've settled the karma with He Changkong, I'll retreat into seclusion—aside from occasional trips to Green Bamboo Mountain—to focus solely on cultivation and consolidate my progress."

Two more days passed.

Wang Chan rose early.

He started the day with a lavish breakfast—mid-grade spirit rice porridge, mid-grade green lamb, fire-ox meat, white-haired donkey meat, pickled vegetables… and a pot of spirit wine worth twenty spirit coins, renowned for its yang-enhancing properties.

After eating and drinking his fill, he bathed in water infused with premium spirit spring water and Foundation-Nourishing Spirit Liquid.

Next, he burned spirit incense, allowing its fragrance to envelop him before donning fine green robes and sturdy shoes.

Then, from his storage pouch, he retrieved two mid-grade Golden Armor Talismans, three mid-grade Protective Talismans, and a stack of mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans, tucking them into his sleeves, securing them to his legs, or concealing them in the soles of his feet.

Inside his storage pouch, the [Butterfly Dart Blade] lay quietly. The white jade pendant around his neck radiated warmth, and hidden within each sleeve were two silver needles.

Once fully prepared, Wang Chan pushed open his door beneath the morning sun, brimming with vigor and determination.

Barring any surprises, today was the day for a grand endeavor.

*Knock.*

*Knock, knock.*

But before he could step out, a familiar rapping sounded at his door, followed by Zhang the Hunchback's voice.

"Fellow Daoist Wang, it's me."

This uninvited guest. Wang Chan sighed inwardly but invited him in nonetheless.

The man had claimed he'd be gone for at least half a month, yet here he was, returning after barely a week. Truly unexpected.

Had his wife in the city lost her charm? Or were the courtesans at the brothel no longer to his liking?

But what was with the bruised and swollen face? Had he skipped out on paying at a pleasure house? Or had he stirred up trouble elsewhere?

"Your face…" Wang Chan couldn't help but ask.

A minor nuisance was one thing. But if this was serious trouble, as neighbors, they might all be dragged into it.
