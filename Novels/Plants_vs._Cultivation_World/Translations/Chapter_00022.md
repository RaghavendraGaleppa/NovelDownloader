# Chapter 22: Harvesting Spirit Rice

After packing up everything, Gu Mo headed toward the Spirit Plant Hall in the valley. Along the way, vast fields of mature spirit rice stretched before him, with many labor disciples wielding sickles to harvest the crops.

The spirit fields in the valley were all of decent quality, and with professional spirit farmers managing them, their maturation naturally wasn't slower than Gu Mo's. Some had even ripened earlier. What Gu Mo saw now were mostly low-grade first-tier spirit fields on the outskirts of the valley. Even so, the Jade Spirit Rice from these fields had matured at about the same time as his, a testament to the skill of the Spirit Plant Hall's professional farmers. The only thing that seemed lacking was the use of sickles for harvesting, which felt somewhat mundane for an immortal cultivation setting.

"Elder, I've come to submit my spirit rice!"

Arriving at the Spirit Plant Hall's granary, Gu Mo presented his identity token. This was where harvested rice was registered and collected—all the spirit rice reaped in the valley would eventually be gathered here.

"A labor disciple?"

The steward in charge of rice collection was momentarily stunned when he saw Gu Mo's labor disciple token. Most of those who came to submit spirit rice were outer sect disciples—those who had leased large tracts of spirit fields. Labor disciples typically worked under outer sect disciples, doing menial tasks, and thus rarely had any rice to submit.

"Ah, so you're Gu Mo, aren't you?"

After a brief moment of surprise, the steward quickly recalled the situation. This year, a labor disciple in the Spirit Plant Hall had managed to lease a spirit field. This had become quite the topic of discussion, not just because Gu Mo had secured a field, but also due to his inferior spiritual roots and astonishing comprehension.

But wasn't it a bit early for him to be submitting rice now? For a newly enrolled labor disciple attempting to grow spirit rice for the first time, avoiding failure would already be a stroke of luck. Coming this early—could he have harvested the rice before it was fully mature?

Such incidents weren't unheard of in the Spirit Plant Hall. Most sect disciples were recruited from the mortal world, and many mortals had no knowledge of farming.

However, the steward's furrowed brows soon relaxed as Gu Mo presented his rice—its quality was exceptional. The steward tossed the rice spikes into a special artifact, likely a hulling device. The spikes went in, and out came grains of spirit rice that resembled polished jade.

"Jade Spirit Rice—500 catties!"

After tallying the output, the steward's eyes widened in disbelief. Gu Mo had managed to produce 500 catties of spirit rice from just one mu of land. While this yield was average by the Spirit Plant Hall's standards, it would be considered high yield anywhere else.

For a labor disciple to achieve this on his first attempt was nothing short of miraculous.

"No wonder Elder Zhao holds him in such high regard. This talent is truly remarkable," the steward mused inwardly. "How do you plan to handle this rice?"

Zhao Qiancheng had waived Gu Mo's rent for three years, so all this rice belonged to him. Gu Mo had three options: submit it to the sect in exchange for contribution points, sell it at the nearby market for spirit stones, or keep it for personal consumption.

Consuming spirit rice could enhance cultivation speed, though the effect wasn't as potent as pills. Its advantage lay in having no side effects, unlike pills, which couldn't be taken long-term.

Gu Mo had already decided. He would submit 300 catties to the sect for contribution points. These points could be exchanged for techniques, spells, artifacts, pills, and talismans—many of which couldn't be obtained with spirit stones alone.

Thus, he allocated the bulk of his harvest for contributions—one point per catty of rice.

Of the remaining 200 catties, part would be kept for personal consumption. With the Solar Essence at his disposal, Gu Mo didn't need the rice for cultivation boosts—he simply wanted to enjoy its flavor. As an immortal cultivator, eating ordinary food lacked the proper "immortal" touch.

The rest he planned to sell at the market for spirit stones. While the sect also accepted rice in exchange for stones, the rate was slightly lower.

At this stage, Gu Mo couldn't afford to ignore the price difference. A trip to the market would net him dozens more spirit stones.

After exchanging 300 catties for 300 contribution points, Gu Mo headed straight for the Merit Hall to trade his newly acquired points for a concealment technique—one that could mask his cultivation level.

With three Solar Flowers now in his possession, he needed to prepare for his upcoming cultivation. Once he began, the triple Solar Flower boost would grant him the cultivation speed of a top-tier spiritual root. Without concealment, such rapid progress from a labor disciple with inferior roots would raise suspicions.

The Merit Hall was the sect's hub for exchanging contribution points for techniques, secret arts, and treasures. Each peak and hall had its own branch. However, the actual items weren't stored here—the hall merely served as an interface.

The vaults and libraries housing these treasures were restricted areas. To meet the disciples' needs, the Merit Hall acted as a middleman—disciples selected their desired items here, which were then delivered afterward.

At the hall, Gu Mo approached an unoccupied counter and received a thick catalog from an elegant senior sister. It listed all the techniques, secret arts, and spells available for exchange.

Flipping to the secret arts section, Gu Mo found what he was looking for—the *Qi Concealment Art*.

This technique was fairly common, with modest effects. At proficiency, it could shield one's cultivation from peers of the same realm. Only at mastery could it conceal one's level from those a full major realm above.

Mastering such an art would be challenging even for Gu Mo, but options were scarce—this was the only one available.

The sect likely possessed superior techniques, but they wouldn't reveal all their treasures for exchange.

Glancing at the price of the lackluster *Qi Concealment Art*, Gu Mo's disappointment deepened—it cost 3,000 contribution points.

This far exceeded his expectations. First-tier spells typically cost only 100-200 points. But secret arts and spells were fundamentally different—the former were specialized cultivation methods with unique effects, while the latter were combat techniques.

With an annual yield of 1,000 catties (500 per harvest, twice a year), Gu Mo would need three years of farming to save up 3,000 points.

Three years wasn't an unbearable wait. Cultivators lived longer than mortals, and their lifespans increased with each breakthrough. In the grand scheme, three years meant little.

Yet without a concealment art, Gu Mo couldn't cultivate at full speed. For most cultivators, abstaining from cultivation for three years would be career suicide. But Gu Mo could manage.

By not cultivating, he wouldn't consume Solar Essence. Instead, he could continue purchasing Solar Flowers and stockpile more essence, allowing him to rapidly catch up later.

Still, if possible, Gu Mo preferred not to delay. Advancing his cultivation sooner would grant him the strength to protect himself.
