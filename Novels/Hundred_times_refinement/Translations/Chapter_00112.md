# Chapter 62: Demonic Cultivation Techniques  

"You can ponder that question in the underworld!"  

A cold smile curled at the corners of Lin Xuan's lips as he formed a peculiar hand seal, channeling his spiritual power into the flying sword.  

"Go!"  

Like a streak of light, the flying sword shot toward his opponent with a piercing whistle. Ye Tian's face paled as he desperately poured his spiritual energy into the demonic banner. But it was futile—though the ghostly mist formed a sturdy protective barrier, it was like tofu against the terrifying might of a high-grade spiritual artifact. With a harsh tearing sound, the barrier shattered, and a bloody hole appeared in Ye Tian's chest. He collapsed, his face twisted with unwillingness.  

Lin Xuan beckoned, and the spiritual artifact returned to his hand, shrinking back into a tiny sword. With Ye Tian's spiritual power gone, the giant skeleton battling the demonic tiger disintegrated into vengeful spirits and returned to the banner.  

The low-grade spiritual artifact, the Fire Serpent, also fell from the air. Lin Xuan cast a spell to retrieve it, along with the Golden Binding Rope, and stored them away.  

The Beast Talisman reverted to its original form, though its spiritual energy had weakened considerably. It seemed the demonic tiger's spirit had nearly exhausted its energy in this battle.  

Lin Xuan winced at the loss, but the rewards from this fight were substantial. He approached Ye Tian's corpse, first picking up the demonic banner, then retrieving a storage pouch from his robes.  

After looting everything of value, Lin Xuan knew it was unwise to linger. He cast a low-level Quicksand Talisman, sinking Ye Tian's body into the ground, then carefully erased all traces of blood before swiftly returning to Piaoyun Valley.  

Without delay, he headed straight back to his quarters in the abandoned alchemy room on Danxia Mountain.  

Closing the door behind him, Lin Xuan flopped onto his bed. This battle had been far more perilous than his previous encounter with the Yan family patriarch. The demonic cultivator's techniques were sinister and unpredictable, and Ye Tian had wielded numerous tricks.  

Yet, in the end, Lin Xuan had emerged victorious.  

After resting for a while and recovering his strength and spiritual power, he began examining his spoils. He emptied the storage pouch, and dozens of spirit stones clattered onto the table, making his eyes gleam. A quick count revealed over fifty.  

Lin Xuan was both delighted and astonished. Even Zhang Yu hadn't possessed this many spirit stones back then. Whether Ye Tian had obtained them through theft, extortion, or deceit didn't matter—they were all his now.  

In addition, there were seven or eight mid-grade talismans. Though not a vast number, they were still a welcome gain.  

At the bottom of the storage pouch lay a jade slip, different from the ordinary kind. Its surface shimmered with a bloody-red glow, exuding an eerie aura. This, Lin Xuan surmised, must contain the demonic cultivation techniques.  

Curious, he infused his spiritual sense into it.  

---  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan had finished reading the entire manual. Holding the jade slip, he remained silent.  

It had to be admitted—the demonic cultivators of the past were undeniably ingenious, devising such unorthodox methods to drastically accelerate cultivation progress. Truth be told, Lin Xuan felt a flicker of temptation. But he quickly dismissed the thought.  

It wasn't due to any moral qualms about good and evil. Rather, as the sect elders had warned, while demonic techniques offered rapid advancement, they came with severe flaws and hidden dangers. The reckless pursuit of speed led to unstable foundations and shaky Dao hearts, which would ultimately hinder future progress. Worse, it could result in qi deviation and eternal ruin.  

Lin Xuan had no intention of ending his path to immortality in such a tragic manner. Haste made waste—with his purification ability and diligent efforts, he could still achieve great heights without resorting to shortcuts.  

Though he wouldn't practice demonic cultivation, the jade slip wasn't entirely useless. While he wouldn't follow the cultivation method, it contained many mysterious and esoteric spells.  

Spells were merely applications of spiritual power. Whether from orthodox or demonic sources, learning them wouldn't harm his cultivation or body.  

After a brief review, Lin Xuan noted several spells that could prove quite useful. He could study them at his leisure later.  

Setting the jade slip aside, he turned his attention to the other two items.  

First was the Hundred Souls Banner. Having experienced its power firsthand, Lin Xuan knew it was formidable—capable of both offense and defense. However, it didn't quite match the description in the jade slip.  

According to the demonic manual, the banner should rival a high-grade spiritual artifact. Yet during his battle with Ye Tian, it hadn't seemed that powerful.  

Otherwise, even with the Beast Talisman's advantageous elemental counter, it wouldn't have been overwhelmed so easily.  

Lin Xuan guessed that the demonic treasure hadn't been fully refined, limiting its power. Still, even in its incomplete state, it surpassed mid-grade spiritual artifacts, making it a valuable asset.  

Lastly, there was the low-grade Fire Serpent. For most Qi Refinement disciples, even a low-grade spiritual artifact was a rare treasure. But Lin Xuan was different—his wealth allowed him to dismiss such items. He planned to trade the Fire Serpent for spirit stones or materials when the opportunity arose.  

All in all, though the battle had been dangerous, the rewards were substantial. The only regret was the Beast Talisman's depleted energy, but compared to the gains, the loss was negligible.  

---  

After organizing his loot and storing it in his spatial bracelet, Lin Xuan lay down and fell into a deep sleep. Though his spiritual power and stamina had recovered, the intense battle had left him exhausted.  

The next morning, he resumed his cultivation.  

This time, instead of rushing to break through to the next level, he decided to practice Spirit Control Art. Having experienced two battles, Lin Xuan fully appreciated the advantages of spiritual artifacts. Yet, relying solely on basic manipulation techniques limited their potential.  

Now, he wanted to master the true method of wielding them—Spirit Control Art.
