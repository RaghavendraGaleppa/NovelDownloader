# Chapter 43: Sixth Level of Qi Refining

As dusk fell, the sun gradually sank in the west while a bright moon emerged from the clouds in the eastern sky.

Wei Qian suddenly felt something and snapped out of his state of profound communion with nature. "It's already dark? How long have I been cultivating this time?" The thought had barely formed when he turned his gaze to the side.

When he saw the person standing there, Wei Qian was momentarily stunned.

Earlier, he had sensed someone watching him.

He had considered many possibilities—perhaps patrol teams the Li family had stationed on the mountain, or even that young Li Guchen.

But he never expected it to be someone who was neither a stranger nor a close acquaintance.

Li Caiwei, daughter of Li Wanlong, the newly appointed Grand Elder of the Li family!

"Miss, is there something you need?" Wei Qian ventured cautiously.

They didn't have much interaction, after all.

"Nothing in particular," Li Caiwei replied, though she herself couldn't quite explain why she had lingered for so long.

Perhaps it was envy.

Had Wei Qian known her thoughts, he would have been utterly baffled.

What could a young lady from a cultivation family, with a Foundation Establishment elder as her father, possibly envy about a tenant farmer who started as a rogue cultivator?

Li Caiwei didn't dwell on the topic. Instead, she studied Wei Qian closely. "You've reached the fifth level of Qi Refining?"

She recalled their first meeting, when Wei Qian had been nothing more than a rogue cultivator at the first level.

"The early stages of Qi Refining are easier to break through. It gets harder the further you progress," Wei Qian replied. "But Miss, you're already at the sixth level—far ahead of me."

When they first met, Li Caiwei had been at the fourth level of Qi Refining.

Now, in less than three years, she had advanced two levels.

For ordinary cultivators, being stuck at a single level of mid-stage Qi Refining for four or five years was entirely normal.

Li Caiwei gently tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, her tone indifferent. "I only broke through with the help of elixirs. It's not real skill."

Wei Qian's nose twitched slightly as he caught a faint medicinal fragrance wafting from the young woman in the green dress.

"It's similar to the scent Li Wanqing had, though much fainter."

"Probably Purple Qi Pills."

He had seen the name of the Purple Qi Pills on the jade plate artifact—they required two thousand contribution points to exchange.

Li Caiwei certainly didn't have that many contribution points.

But with her father being a Foundation Establishment elder of the family, obtaining a Purple Qi Pill wouldn't be difficult.

"External aids are still part of one's strength," Wei Qian said with a smile. "If using elixirs doesn't count as real skill, then how many cultivators in this world could truly claim to have real skill?"

He spoke the truth.

Take the simplest example—if cultivators weren't allowed to use Foundation Establishment Pills to break through, how many Foundation Establishment cultivators would remain in the world?

Elixirs, magical artifacts, talismans, formations, spirit beasts, puppets—these were all external aids, but who could deny they weren't part of a cultivator's strength?

When two cultivators dueled, if one wielded a low-grade artifact and the other a supreme-grade one, would the latter be expected to discard it and fight with a low-grade artifact instead?

Anyone who harbored such naive notions would be laughed out of the cultivation world.

"What about parents and elders? Do they count as real skill?" Li Caiwei suddenly asked.

Wei Qian didn't hesitate. "Of course."

The child of a Nascent Soul True Monarch, even with an inferior spiritual root, would have a smoother path than a rogue cultivator with a superior spiritual root!

Even as he answered, he wondered to himself: What's going on with this young lady? Could she be having some sort of awakening, wanting to break free from her "original environment" or "family"?

"And what about the grandson of a False Core elder?" Li Caiwei pressed.

Wei Qian was acutely sensitive to the term "False Core elder" and immediately grasped her implication.

His voice lowered unconsciously. "Miss, are you referring to Elder Lai of the Myriad Stars Sect?"

"Yes. Elder Lai has a grandson..." Li Caiwei's voice trailed off.

She forced a smile. "I apologize. I've been in poor spirits lately. I hope I haven't disturbed you."

"May your path to immortality be long and prosperous, Daoist Wei. I'll take my leave now."

With a slight nod, she turned and walked away.

Watching her retreating figure, Wei Qian said nothing and instead headed down the mountain.

He understood clearly that each person's path was unique and unrepeatable. Everyone walked their own road.

Even Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators were merely a few steps ahead of others.

Until death came, no one could say who would go further.

In the days that followed, Wei Qian continued his quiet routine—working and cultivating.

A few days later, he overheard Li family cultivators discussing how Li Caiwei had joined the Myriad Stars Sect. They were all jubilant, believing the Li family had gained a powerful new backer.

"The backing is real, but it's not the Myriad Stars Sect—just a single False Core elder," Wei Qian mused to himself.

Then he scoffed. "But a False Core elder is more than enough to keep the Wang family from acting rashly."

"With this, Misty Ridge Mountain should remain peaceful for many years. That's certainly good news for me."

Events unfolded as Wei Qian predicted.

After a year of turbulence, as the year drew to a close, peace finally settled in.

Wei Qian's cultivation, however, had hit a bottleneck.

He lacked the complete ingredients for refining the Purple Qi Pills, particularly a sufficiently aged main ingredient.

Such herbs could only be found in remote, uninhabited lands, secret realms, or the medicinal gardens of major families and sects.

Yet, even without breakthrough pills, Wei Qian had his own methods.

Within his spiritual sea, facing the Wishing Dragon Pearl, he made a new wish.

"Dragon Pearl, I wish to smoothly break through to the sixth level of Qi Refining."

The Dragon Pearl responded—this wish would require sixty days of accumulated wishes to fulfill.

Spring gave way to summer, summer to autumn, autumn to winter, and winter back to spring.

As the seasons turned, a full year came to an end.

Before the arrival of the second spring, Wei Qian shattered his bottleneck and successfully advanced to the sixth level of Qi Refining.

This year, he was twenty-seven years old.

"Sixty days of wishing—if I had spent those sixty days in arduous cultivation, I could never have guaranteed a breakthrough."

"What if I wished directly for a cultivation breakthrough?"

The thought emerged and quickly spiraled out of control in his mind.

Wei Qian immediately tested it, but the response left him deeply disheartened.

He wished to advance to the seventh level of Qi Refining, but the Dragon Pearl demanded two thousand days of accumulated wishes!

"Improving my spiritual root only took a thousand days."

"Does the Dragon Pearl consider direct cultivation advancement even more difficult than improving one's spiritual root?"
