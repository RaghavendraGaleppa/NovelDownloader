Chapter 86: Concubine Mo Qingchan

The light purple *Tiange* was refined from the single horn of a second-tier flood dragon and was named Zi Li Ge by Lu Xu. This spirit artifact is primarily offensive. In terms of power, it is quite similar to the Azure Radiance Green Lightning Blade Lu Xu had purchased before, both being among the most powerful low-grade spirit artifacts.

The black shield was refined from the scales of a flood dragon. Lu Xu named it the Black Scale Shield. This shield excels in defense and is also a fine piece among spirit artifacts.
