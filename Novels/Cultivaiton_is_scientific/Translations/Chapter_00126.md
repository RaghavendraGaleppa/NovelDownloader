# Chapter 126: The Explosion

Four days later, Li Shiming was deeply immersed in his studies when he sensed an alert from his split soul—an anomaly had been detected.  

He ended his learning session with IBMz15 and accessed the split soul's vision through shared perception.  

Two figures appeared in the distance at first, but in an instant, they were already above the small island. Their speed was unlike anything he had ever witnessed.  

His split soul, positioned a full kilometer away from the island, felt on the verge of collapse under the oppressive aura emanating from one of the figures.  

Li Shiming thought of the old monk Du Yuan and the aura exuded by Elder Quan atop the Nine Peaks.  

"Damn it, how could it be a Golden Core Elder?" His heart pounded with terror.  

He had never imagined that a Golden Core Elder would come this time.  

Now, he could guess the identity of this elder—there was an eighty percent chance it was Baili Luò, father of Baili Jinyan and an elder of the Sacred Ice Sect.  

Only this Golden Core Elder would personally appear in these waters.  

Golden Core Elders of any sect were figures of immense mystery.  

Sect affairs never disturbed them, and sect authority held no meaning for them.  

With absolute power at their disposal, authority merely became a tool to serve them.  

Take Sect Leader Yu of the Heavenly Ocean Sect, for example. His strength only reached the late Foundation Establishment stage, and his status couldn't compare to that of a Golden Core Elder. Yet, he was the foremost figure in charge of the sect's authority.  

Li Shiming controlled his split soul, slowly sinking it into the sea.  

He didn't dare let it approach him, instead directing it to move away in the opposite direction.  

He regretted not positioning himself farther from the island—a kilometer's distance wasn't safe at all.  

Fortunately, he had chosen to hide deep underwater, where the sea would greatly impede a cultivator's perception—something he had tested before.  

Unless someone conducted a large-scale spiritual scan, it would be nearly impossible to detect him hidden among the underwater reefs.  

Li Shiming switched his vision to the eyepiece connected to the pinhole camera hidden in the island's cave dwelling.  

At this point, whether it was a Foundation Establishment or Golden Core cultivator, the trap was already set, and he didn't need to take any risks himself.  

Kuai Yun was the first to enter the cave. When he found the two late-stage Qi Refining cultivators missing from the main hall, he froze in surprise.  

It had never occurred to him that the two might have fled. They had grown up in the Sacred Ice Sect, enjoying its resources and bound to it almost inseparably.  

More importantly, without the sect's resources, the two would have no hope of further progress.  

After all, they practiced the Sacred Ice Sect's core techniques, the resources for which were almost entirely monopolized by the sect.  

Moreover, desertion was a grave crime. No matter where they fled on this continent, they would be hunted down relentlessly.  

Staying might not mean death, but fleeing certainly would.  

"Master, perhaps they went to the Heavenly Ocean Sect to attempt another assassination!" Kuai Yun bowed deeply to the grim-faced Elder Baili.  

"Kuai Yun, you oversee sect intelligence and assassinations, yet you've grown lax!" Elder Baili said coldly.  

He didn't care about the two Qi Refining cultivators—only matters related to Baili Jinyan. For instance, he wanted Li Shiming dead, yet the boy still lived, which infuriated him.  

His original plan had been to place certain measures on the two Qi Refining cultivators, sending them to intercept and kill Li Shiming in the waters between Eagle Beak Island and the Nine Peaks.  

If successful, the two would likely be killed by the Heavenly Ocean Sect. But if they survived, it would at least rectify their earlier mistake.  

But now that he was here and the two were missing, his plan couldn't proceed, leaving him furious.  

"Master, perhaps I should take action myself. If I'm careful, there shouldn't be any issues," Kuai Yun said, his face flushed with shame.  

"Fool! You're my direct disciple. If you're discovered, even I won't be able to escape blame!" Elder Baili snapped. After a pause, he added, "Issue a sect-wide mission: whoever kills Li Shiming will become my nominal disciple!"  

Half a year had passed with no word from Baili Jinyan. Elder Baili knew the chances of his son's survival grew slimmer by the day.  

His thirst for vengeance outweighed everything else. Yet, whether within the sect or between the Heavenly Ocean and Dark Abyss Sects, he couldn't act freely.  

The crux of the matter wasn't some insignificant fourth-stage Qi Refining cultivator. By now, he had already eliminated nearly all the sect members connected to Baili Jinyan's disappearance, as well as those from the Heavenly Ocean Sect.  

The only exception was Yin Shilan, whom he hadn't yet been able to touch.  

Now, he discovered that Li Shiming—the boy who had provoked Baili Jinyan's anger and was close to Yin Shilan—was still alive.  

The Sacred Ice Sect members who had encouraged Baili Jinyan to go to the Heavenly Ocean Sect had all been captured and tortured to death by Elder Baili. On the Heavenly Ocean Sect's side, the three Qi Refining cultivators who had spread rumors on Longming Island met the same fate.  

Of course, Elder Baili never suspected that Li Shiming or any other Qi Refining cultivator could be responsible for Baili Jinyan's disappearance. He had absolute confidence in his son's strength.  

Among Qi Refining cultivators—at least on this continent—few could rival him.  

Only a powerful Foundation Establishment expert or a Golden Core cultivator could pose a threat, rendering Baili Jinyan unable to escape.  

Yet, after extensive investigations, neither the strongest Foundation Establishment cultivators nor any Golden Core figures had emerged as suspects.  

With his rage finding no outlet, Li Shiming became the perfect target.  

"Understood. I'll issue the mission upon returning to the sect," Kuai Yun replied, startled by his master's offer.  

A nominal disciple of a Golden Core Elder held a status surpassing most Foundation Establishment cultivators within the sect.  

This was an opportunity to receive direct guidance from a Golden Core Elder—a monumental chance for nearly every sect member.  

Kuai Yun wondered how long Li Shiming could survive once this mission was issued.  

For such a prize, sect members would likely dare to strike even near the Heavenly Ocean Sect's Nine Peaks.  

Li Shiming witnessed and heard everything happening in the cave.  

Trembling with anger and fear, he couldn't believe a Golden Core Elder would fixate on a mere fourth-stage Qi Refining cultivator like him.  

Even now, he wasn't sure whether Elder Baili had discovered the truth about his son's death or if there was another reason.  

He never imagined that Yin Shilan played a significant role in Elder Baili's vendetta against him.  

"Die!" Li Shiming's heart turned cold as he sent the detonation command through the underwater cable connected to the cave's formation.  

Elder Baili sensed the faint, peculiar energy fluctuation first. He glanced at the ground—no spiritual energy disturbance, yet an overwhelming sense of danger gripped him.  

"Interesting. So there's a trap here. Let's see which fellow Daoist is behind this," he mused, more intrigued than alarmed.  

His long investigation into Baili Jinyan's disappearance had yielded no leads.  

Now, with someone setting a trap, it meant the hidden perpetrator would soon reveal themselves.  

As a Golden Core cultivator, Elder Baili had faced countless dangers. He had slaughtered thousands, if not tens of thousands, to reach his current status.  

He feared no battle. In fact, he longed to meet the mastermind behind this and fight to the death.  

Elder Baili assumed the trap was the work of a peer—and for good reason.  

First, no ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator's trap could evoke such a sense of threat. Second, only a fellow Golden Core cultivator would dare set a trap for him.  

As for Qi Refining cultivators? They weren't even worth considering.  

A tiny sword appeared before Elder Baili. Kuai Yun quickly retreated behind his master, knowing his intervention was unnecessary.  

But neither of them anticipated the attack would come in a form they'd never imagined.  

Mortals couldn't harm cultivators—especially not a Golden Core cultivator.  

In the mortal world, a single late-stage Qi Refining cultivator was enough to oversee an entire nation.  

And such overseers weren't there to control mortals but to suppress rogue cultivators.  

This showed how little cultivators thought of the mortal realm—never in history had mortals harmed a cultivator.  

Two tons of solid-state explosives—meticulously prepared by Li Shiming to the strictest military standards—detonated beneath Elder Baili and Kuai Yun.  

Even hidden a kilometer away within an underwater reef, Li Shiming felt the earth-shattering tremor.  

The reef emitted faint cracking sounds but held firm.  

Flames and shockwaves erupted within the confined cave in a deafening explosion.  

Two tons of explosives—enough to level a mountain—were unleashed upon Elder Baili and Kuai Yun.  

The small sword before Elder Baili expanded into a massive blade, shielding him as he unleashed a beam of light from his other hand.  

The beam tore through the flames and debris, creating an escape path.  

The Golden Core cultivator's terrifying power was on full display as he withstood the explosion.  

Of course, caught completely off-guard, the blast's full force struck the giant sword first.  

Golden Core weapons were known as magic treasures, nurtured within the cultivator's core and requiring at least third-grade materials.  

Elder Baili believed offense was the best defense, so he had summoned a sword-type treasure.  

Though not designed for defense, the treasure's power could still serve the purpose—at the cost of severe damage.  

After blasting an escape route, Elder Baili spat a mouthful of blood.  

The giant sword's glow dimmed rapidly. He tried to recall it, but the explosion had wrecked its internal inscriptions and spiritual bonds.  

Damage to a soul-bound treasure was akin to a severe injury for a Golden Core cultivator.  

A chill ran down Elder Baili's spine as he sensed death's approach. If he lingered and the hidden Golden Core cultivator appeared, he'd be finished.  

At this point, he couldn't spare a thought for Kuai Yun.  

Leaving even his damaged treasure behind, he transformed into a streak of blood light and vanished.  

Everything happened too fast. By the time Kuai Yun realized his master was gone, he was fully exposed to the explosion.  

Li Shiming had overestimated Foundation Establishment cultivators, assuming Kuai Yun was a Foundation Establishment version of Baili Jinyan. He was wrong.  

Cultivators like Baili Jinyan were rare—favored sons with Golden Core fathers, sect resources, top-tier techniques, and fully developed physiques, spiritual power, and souls.  

Kuai Yun, however, was an average Foundation Establishment cultivator with no focus on body refinement—a common trait.  

Body refinement required vast resources during Qi Refining, and even more during Foundation Establishment.  

Most cultivators struggled to gather enough resources for spiritual cultivation, let alone body refinement.  

With Elder Baili present, Kuai Yun hadn't even bothered to defend himself—why would his defenses surpass his master's?  

Elder Baili's blood escape left Kuai Yun defenseless against the explosion.  

His spiritual shield shattered instantly, followed by his body and life.  

Through his split soul's final glimpse, Li Shiming saw the fleeing blood streak—its aura so terrifying it made the soul tremble uncontrollably.  

Then the shockwave hit, obliterating the split soul entirely.  

What should have lasted ten days was destroyed in four.  

Once the aftershocks subsided, Li Shiming burst from the reef.  

He was certain the escapee was Elder Baili Luò, meaning the Foundation Establishment cultivator had perished in the blast.  

The belongings of a dead Foundation Establishment cultivator—even fragments—were a considerable fortune.  

He had to move fast. The explosion's shockwaves would soon reach the Heavenly Ocean Sect's detection range, despite being just beyond its thousand-mile perimeter.  

His wings propelled him swiftly to the blast site. The island had vanished entirely, along with its submerged portion.  

Scanning the area with his spiritual sense, he searched for remnants.  

He found the Foundation Establishment cultivator's corpse—bones intact but flesh partially missing, robes in tatters.  

Miraculously, a charred storage bag remained intact—a pleasant surprise.  

His spiritual sense then detected a sword-shaped metal fragment pulsing with residual energy that sent shivers down his spine. Without hesitation, he pocketed it.
