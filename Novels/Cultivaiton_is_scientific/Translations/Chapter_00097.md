# Chapter 97: Breakthrough  

To Li Shiming's surprise, Yin Shilan did not arrive as expected, and even their midday communication was interrupted.  

Ten days later, while adjusting the spiritual fields with the 'Earth Spirit Technique,' he felt a warning from his identity jade slip—someone was approaching the defensive formation of Eagle Beak Island.  

Assuming it was Qiu Tan delivering goods, he went out with a smile to greet them.  

When he saw a verdant flying boat, his heart settled.  

Having lost contact in the cultivation world, he had been worried about Yin Shilan's safety for quite some time.  

He had even considered using his limited connections within the sect to inquire about her if she remained unresponsive.  

Given his status, the only person he knew was Senior Brother Zhu Ji, who had guided him as a newcomer. However, their relationship had not continued after the newcomer period ended.  

The main reason was that Li Shiming resided outside the Nine Peaks, while Zhu Ji was at the late Qi Refining stage, making it difficult for them to interact.  

Their only connection was the three-month newcomer period and the favor owed by two uncles.  

Using these connections would essentially exhaust all his social capital.  

"You're here!" Li Shiming smiled as he saw the green-robed figure standing on the deck of the flying boat.  

"I was suddenly assigned a mission outside the sect six days ago and just returned!" Yin Shilan replied with a radiant smile.  

What she didn't mention was that, in her eagerness to return, she had flown continuously for over a dozen hours after completing the mission, skipping even a stop at the sect to come straight here.  

Hearing her explanation, Li Shiming's mood lifted, and his days of worry vanished.  

Yin Shilan stored the flying boat, and the two entered Eagle Beak Island together.  

"These are spices I planted for my own indulgence, and these are Spirit Talisman Bamboos I obtained before joining the sect—they've transplanted quite successfully!" Li Shiming introduced the island's features with a smile.  

Though the spiritual plants and scenery on the island were ordinary, Yin Shilan's interest remained undiminished.  

She knew how difficult it was for a newly joined cultivator with no foundation to accomplish so much.  

Among Li Shiming's batch of newcomers, he was the only one who had established an external cave abode.  

Inside the cave, Li Shiming boiled prepared spiritual spring water and brewed a pot of spiritual tea for Yin Shilan.  

He didn't possess treasures like the Glazed Yuan-Gathering Cup, so he used an ordinary glass cup, albeit one with an exquisite design.  

Yin Shilan was no stranger to the hardships of ordinary cultivators. Seeing the spiritual tea, she felt deeply moved.  

She had tasted far superior teas before, but for a newly joined cultivator like Li Shiming, preparing such tea must have come at a great cost.  

Yet she said nothing, only smiling as she picked up the glass cup and took a sip.  

Li Shiming was also curious about the spiritual tea he had grown—this was his first time tasting it.  

The two quietly savored the tea, enjoying the spiritual benefits it brought.  

The first sip of any spiritual tea always delivered the greatest effect.  

Li Shiming felt a surge of spiritual energy in his abdomen, though it was far weaker than the tea he had shared with Yin Shilan on the flying boat.  

However, he was currently at the bottleneck of the third level of Qi Refining, and his aptitude was not poor.  

As the spiritual energy surged, he sensed the bottleneck loosening.  

Both Senior Brother Zhu Ji's teachings during the newcomer period and general knowledge about Qi Refining cultivators emphasized that once a bottleneck loosened, one must seize the rare opportunity to break through immediately.  

Missing the chance would mean waiting again for the next opportunity.  

"Excuse me for a moment!" Li Shiming hastily said before rushing into the cultivation chamber.  

Yin Shilan's eyes sparkled with amusement as she smiled.  

Her cultivation level was much higher than Li Shiming's, so she easily discerned his current state.  

She had noticed his bottleneck at the third level of Qi Refining the moment they met.  

She hadn't asked why he hadn't used the top-grade first-tier Breakthrough Pill—once she gifted cultivation resources, how he used them was his choice.  

Cultivators were inherently self-directed in their decisions. With her reserved yet intelligent nature, she naturally refrained from interfering.  

Seeing Li Shiming's reaction, she realized this was his first time drinking this tea, reinforcing her belief that he had prepared it especially for her.  

Her clear, limpid eyes brimmed with warmth, and the curve of her lips was as perfect as a crescent moon, brightening the room like a field of blooming flowers.  

Unfortunately, Li Shiming missed this sight—he was already seated in the cultivation chamber, circulating the 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art.'  

He hadn't expected his breakthrough to come so soon. Weren't the major bottlenecks for Three Spiritual Roots cultivators supposed to be notoriously difficult?  

For Three Spiritual Roots cultivators, breakthroughs were of moderate difficulty—above them were the geniuses with Single and Dual Spiritual Roots, who only needed continuous cultivation during Qi Refining.  

Single Spiritual Roots cultivators, in particular, often practiced body-refining techniques alongside their cultivation to build the most solid foundation, deliberately slowing their progress to avoid unstable realms.  

Such geniuses never focused solely on Qi Refining but aimed for higher realms.  

In contrast, Four and Five Spiritual Roots cultivators faced the opposite extreme.  

Every minor realm breakthrough was a formidable challenge, making Qi Refining an arduous journey for them.  

This was why most Four and Five Spiritual Roots cultivators never advanced beyond Qi Refining—they spent too much time struggling in the early stages, leaving them with insufficient lifespan and cultivation to progress further.  

Three Spiritual Roots cultivators were relatively ordinary—neither geniuses like Single or Dual Spiritual Roots nor struggling like Four or Five Spiritual Roots. They only faced significant bottlenecks when advancing from early to mid or mid to late Qi Refining, with minor realm breakthroughs being relatively easier.  

Yet Li Shiming's breakthrough still surprised him, largely due to his recent experiences.  

Yin Shilan's sudden disappearance had unsettled him. Even with the help of his IBMz15 to regulate his mental state, his mood had been affected.  

Now that Yin Shilan had returned, his spirits soared beyond their usual level.  

Coupled with the stimulating effect of the new spiritual tea, the conditions for a breakthrough were ripe.  

Most importantly, everything had happened naturally, without any forced intent—the key to a successful breakthrough.  

As the bottleneck in his body shattered, the spiritual energy vortex within him expanded twofold, and his aura surged upward.  

The breakthrough was incredibly smooth—he didn't even need to draw on the spiritual energy stored in his machine space.  

After stabilizing his spiritual energy vortex, he returned to the main chamber.  

Yin Shilan sensed the change in his aura immediately.  

"It seems I was fortunate to witness your breakthrough today!" she congratulated him with a light laugh.  

Li Shiming studied her in return. At the third level of Qi Refining, he couldn't discern her strength. Now at the fourth level—mid Qi Refining—he still couldn't perceive it.  

If even mid Qi Refining couldn't sense her power, she either practiced a special concealment technique or had reached late Qi Refining.  

He suspected both were true; otherwise, he would have detected at least some fluctuation in her spiritual energy.  

"I didn't need the Breakthrough Pill—it's too precious. You should keep it for your Foundation Establishment." He took out the jade vial and offered it to her.  

Yin Shilan didn't accept it, instead giving him a reproachful look.  

"This pill was exchanged for your formation diagrams, which I've already memorized and can't return. You should keep it," she said softly, her expression softening.  

Recognizing her stubbornness, Li Shiming reluctantly stored the vial again.  

Seeing him comply, Yin Shilan smiled faintly once more.  

Every time he saw her smile, Li Shiming felt enchanted.  

An ordinary third-level Qi Refining cultivator might feel inadequate before a cultivator like Yin Shilan—her beauty, strength, and resources far surpassed his.  

But Li Shiming's soul hailed from another world, where equality was ingrained.  

Over time, Yin Shilan had come to appreciate this about him. With him, she felt a sense of equality—neither the condescension some male cultivators displayed nor the subservience of those weaker than her.  

His attitude was natural, whether in face-to-face conversations or through the identity jade slip.  

Though they hadn't seen each other in days, they didn't speak much. Sitting quietly, they simply enjoyed each other's company, basking in the warmth of the cave's atmosphere.  

When Yin Shilan felt her identity jade slip vibrate, she quickly checked it.  

"The sect has summoned me—I must leave," she said softly. She placed the Spirit Turtle Shield before him and added, "I can't use this shield. Only your computational abilities can operate it."  

Hearing her departure, Li Shiming felt as if time had flown by.  

His attention shifted to the Spirit Turtle Shield. Though its surface appeared unchanged, the intricate new lines and patterns within each fissure marked its transformation.  

"You completed the formation?" he asked, astonished.  

Though he had proposed the idea and co-designed the formation with her, this was a full-fledged formation—and one miniaturized onto the shield.  

Completing it in less than twenty days must have required immense effort.  

"Yes, I was lucky—no mistakes were made," Yin Shilan replied with modest pride, lightly touching her hair.  

As Li Shiming examined the shield, Yin Shilan stood, leaving him no chance to refuse as she prepared to leave.  

"Take this, keep it safe." Knowing her temperament, Li Shiming didn't press the shield issue. Instead, he retrieved a pocket watch from his robes and handed it to her.  

Yin Shilan accepted it, her cheeks tinged pink as she felt the warmth from his body lingering on the watch.  

"Such exquisite craftsmanship—a timekeeping device!" she murmured in admiration.  

The cultivation world had timekeeping artifacts, but they were bulkier and required spirit stones to operate.  

This pocket watch, however, showcased unparalleled ingenuity, pushing the limits of mortal craftsmanship.  

"I'm glad you don't disdain mortal objects. This was a pastime creation of mine, but it's been with me for a long time. It can also function as a stopwatch," Li Shiming explained, relieved she appreciated it.  

He had worried she might look down on non-spiritual items—a common attitude among cultivators, who prized only spirit-infused artifacts.  

"What is a 'second'?" Yin Shilan asked, seemingly forgetting her urgency to leave.  

Li Shiming explained the timekeeping system from his previous life, which he had adapted for the watch to measure shorter intervals.  

Yin Shilan listened intently, her admiration growing. The watch's stopwatch and calendar functions would aid her in managing the complex timing aspects of formations.  

Even in the cultivation world, measuring intervals shorter than the standard "breath" was subjective.  

Formation masters like her required precise timing, making the watch invaluable.  

"What is this called?" she asked, looking up.  

"I haven't named it yet. Would you like to?" Li Shiming offered with a smile.  

He hadn't planned to use the term "pocket watch," as even in his past life, each watch had its own brand and model name.  

"Then I'll think of one and tell you later," Yin Shilan replied with a faint smile.  

Feeling another vibration from her jade slip, she finally rose. "I must go."  

Li Shiming escorted her to the island's edge. As she boarded her flying boat, she waved farewell from the deck.  

At some point, they had stopped addressing each other formally as "fellow daoist," yet no new titles had taken their place—just the intimacy of "you" and "I."  

---  

Elsewhere, Qiu Tan rode his spirit beast, a white bird, looking rather disheveled. The bird flew sluggishly under the weight of a large wooden crate strapped to its back.  

"Finally arriving. I'll have to ask Fellow Daoist Li for extra spirit stones—this delivery wasn't cheap," Qiu Tan muttered as Eagle Beak Island grew nearer.  

Transporting these goods had been a hassle: caravans and military escorts overland, then ships to the coast, before he took over near the sect's waters.
