Chapter 400: Hua Xiangrong

Only cultivators whose state of mind has reached the "Heart as a Bright Mirror Stand," or someone like Xu Yunfan who has condensed a True Martial Dharma Form through武道 (Martial Dao) will, can shatter the threads of passion with the grandeur of the righteous path.

Even if an ordinary cultivator notices something amiss, if their will is not firm, they will find it difficult to control themselves once the poison of passion seeps into their marrow. The harder they try to resist with their cultivation, the more violently the flames of desire will backlash.

"I heard that this technique requires the cultivation base of ninety-nine cultivators. Surely Senior Sister has already achieved great success?"

Judging by the cultivation method of the Thousand Threads of Passion, she must have already drained the life essence of over a thousand mortals.

As expected of a disciple of the Demonic Sect; even an ordinary disciple kills as easily as cutting grass.

Hua Xiangrong covered her mouth with a娇 laugh, her silver-anklet-adorned ankles visible through the high slit of her skirt. "If Junior Brother wants to be the hundredth one!"

She suddenly changed her expression and retreated. It turned out that Xu Yunfan had "accidentally" leaked a wisp of true qi, scorching a black mark into the ground.

Hua Xiangrong looked at the scorch mark on the ground, her face shifting colors several times. In particular, sensing the vigorous vitality and blood energy within Xu Yunfan's body, her eyes seemed as if they were about to swallow him whole.

"To have such vigorous blood energy at the early stage of Qi Refining... Junior Brother, are you perhaps also cultivating the Body Refining Path?"

Xu Yunfan's thoughts raced. Looking at Hua Xiangrong, who still refused to move away, it was clear she truly intended to drain him dry. It seemed that when he went to register at the Hundred Desires Peak back then, his physical physique had whetted the appetites of these disciples who cultivate dual-cultivation and joy-seeking techniques.

Regardless of gender.

He walked the path of the True Martial Dao. The way of the warrior places great emphasis on thick and robust blood energy.

With a body full of vitality and blood energy like a rainbow, his Martial Dao cultivation naturally achieved twice the result with half the effort.

According to the essentials of refining essence into qi, whether it is strength or true qi, it all transforms from blood energy.

Precisely because of his immense blood energy, entering the Hundred Desires Peak was like a fat sheep wandering into a pack of wolves.

Those hungry gazes all wished to rush forward and take a share immediately.

Hua Xiangrong was merely the first to be unable to hold back. How many were lining up behind her waiting to make a move was unknown.

Regardless of gender...

These people had twisted personalities; there were many who played the aggressor, and many who played the submissive.

Especially those disciples of the Hundred Desires Peak who cultivated to the point of having a feminine appearance despite being male, they were truly disgusting.

Xu Yunfan made a decision instantly. Looking at Hua Xiangrong's seductive body and her alluring, silk-like eyes, he put on a smile and said politely, "Senior Sister Hua, I was just worrying about how to cultivate the Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Method. It is timely that you have come. I would like to ask for your advice..."

"Of course!"

A glint of light, like sparks from a star, flashed in Hua Xiangrong's eyes. The fingertips hanging down trembled slightly, and that almost transparent Thousand Thread of Passion retracted into her sleeve like a living creature.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly upon seeing this. As a Martial Dao extreme practitioner, his five senses surpassed what ordinary people could imagine, so he naturally could detect exactly what the hand in Hua Xiangrong's lowered sleeve was doing.

This new disciple before her possessed a pure Yang aura so intense it was like a furnace. If she could absorb and drain his vigorous Yang energy, she would definitely be able to step into the late stage of Qi Refining!

She parted her red lips slightly, breathing out an orchid-like fragrance. "Junior Brother, a physique like yours is quite rare on the Hundred Desires Peak."

As she spoke, the snow-white skin faintly visible through the slit of her skirt, the silver chains tinkled with her steps, sounding especially crisp in the dim room.

She carried a hint of a smile on her face and nodded slightly. "Junior Brother, let's go into the room to discuss it in detail. I will tell you the specifics of the Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Method..."

Xu Yunfan felt a sweet, cloying scent lingering at the tip of his nose. It was neither orchid nor musk, yet it made his blood energy fluctuate slightly.

He stepped aside with a calm expression to let her pass. Hua Xiangrong swept past like a gust of fragrant wind, her skirt fluttering to reveal a half of her jade leg. Her toes touched the bluestone ground, yet not a speck of dust stained them.

"Junior Brother, your residence is quite quiet."

Hua Xiangrong looked around, her fingertips brushing over the simple wooden table, leaving a winding trail in the accumulated dust.

She suddenly turned around, and as her sleeves fluttered, a wisp of pink mist silently spread.

Xu Yunfan felt the scene before him distort slightly. Hua Xiangrong's face became increasingly enchanting in the mist, and the mole at the corner of her eye turned red as if it were about to drip blood.

"Senior Sister, this is..."

"Shh..."

Hua Xiangrong's index finger pressed against his lips, the touch icy cold. "Didn't Junior Brother want to ask about the Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Method?"

Her voice suddenly became holy, yet it carried an infinite sense of charm, with a rhythm that bewitched the heart. "This method requires... skin-to-skin contact to comprehend its true meaning."

Xu Yunfan felt a tightness at his waist and was already pushed down onto the bed by Hua Xiangrong.

The sandalwood bed board let out a creaking sound that seemed unable to bear the weight.

As she leaned over, the pearl strands hanging from the golden hairpin on her head brushed across Xu Yunfan's cheek, bringing a tantalizing itch.

"Does Junior Brother know..."

Her breath was scorching, her lips almost touching Xu Yunfan's earlobe. "Why is it called the Hundred Desires Peak?"

As she spoke, her slender jade fingers slid down his collarbone, drawing circles on his chest. "All people possess a hundred desires, and desire... is actually a great nourishment."

Hua Xiangrong's vermilion lips parted slightly, breathing out an orchid-like fragrance. "This substance can temper the soul and nourish the foundation of the Dao. You must know that even if the physical body sinks into the sea of desire, as long as the Dao heart is clear and bright, it remains untainted. The Peak Master of our Hundred Desires Peak, the Hundred Flowers True Person, also walked this path. She experienced myriad things and condensed a holy mind."

Her fingertips suddenly exerted force.

Xu Yunfan let out a muffled groan, feeling a foreign true qi钻 enter his meridians through an acupoint. Seeing this, Hua Xiangrong laughed, the greed in her eyes intensifying. "Such pure Yang energy. Senior Sister is blessed today."

She swayed her waist lightly, the gauze garment sliding off her shoulder, revealing a strange red pattern on her collarbone. A barely perceptible flicker of surprise flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes.

This red pattern was formed by the Thousand Threads of Passion. It was a mark that only appeared after draining the life essence of at least ninety-nine Qi Refining cultivators.

It was also to be able to instantly activate the Thousand Threads of Passion that she allowed it to leave such a mark.

"Senior Sister is so desperate to drain a fellow disciple..."

Xu Yunfan's breath became slightly erratic. "Aren't you afraid of the sect's retribution?"

Hua Xiangrong's movements paused, a hint of bitterness flashing through the bottom of her eyes, but it was instantly replaced by greed. "Junior Brother, do you know why the Primordial Origin Sect is called the Primordial Demon Sect by the world? It is because the sect prevails with the law of the jungle. On the surface, it prohibits mutual destruction among disciples, but in reality, unknown how many people die every day in secret. All those below Foundation Establishment are mere materials."

Her sharp fingernails slid down, and Xu Yunfan's robe fell away, revealing his strong and refined body.

"The death of a material... is merely a consumption. Junior Brother, it would be quite good to be a mortal in the future."

Before her words had finished, a tremendous suction suddenly came from her lower body, attempting to drain the essence and true qi from Xu Yunfan's body.

However, in this lightning-fast moment, a smile curled up at the corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth.

Hua Xiangrong suddenly widened her eyes. The Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Method she was operating was like mud cattle entering the sea; not only could she not suck out a single wisp of essence, but it was instead reversed and swept back by a mighty force.

"What is going on?!"
