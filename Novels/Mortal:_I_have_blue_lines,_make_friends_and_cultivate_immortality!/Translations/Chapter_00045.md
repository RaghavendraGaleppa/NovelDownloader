# Chapter 45: Plucking Han Li and Xiang Zhili Again! Spirit Treasure - Crimson Sun Jade Ruyi! (3/3)

"Everyone, I assume you've all received the magic tools and spirit stones distributed by the sect. Though I may not be particularly talented, I'd like to offer my support as well," Lin Yun said, waving to the crowd.

"All of you here are my friends! Each of you can receive a high-grade primary talisman!"

Lin Yun personally handed out his talismans to each person one by one.

[Ding! Host has gifted a high-grade primary talisman to friend Bian Yuan, triggering "Give a Plum, Receive a Peach."]

[Ding! Congratulations to the host for obtaining a high-grade primary talisman - Golden Spear Talisman.]

[Treasure Description: An ordinary high-grade primary talisman.]

The first system notification nearly made Lin Yun lose his composure. Fortunately, he had mentally prepared himself.

Most of those present who were entering the Bloody Forbidden Land would likely perish inside. If they had any valuable items on them, they wouldn't have died in there in the first place. Thus, his main targets this time weren't these people—the real targets were Han Li and Xiang Zhili!

This was like making dumplings just for the vinegar, but fortunately, this vinegar was no ordinary vinegar!

[Ding! Host has gifted...]

Looking at the expectant face of the slick little old man before him, Lin Yun asked with concern, "You're Senior Brother Xiang, right? With only the eleventh level of Qi Refinement, are you still planning to enter the Bloody Forbidden Land? Isn't it too dangerous?"

"Ah, no, no! This old man is only at the eleventh level of Qi Refinement, while Senior Brother Lin has reached the peak of Qi Refinement. It's I who should be addressing you as senior brother," Xiang Zhili replied with a flustered wave of his hand upon hearing Lin Yun call him "senior brother."

"Xiang Zhili's acting skills..." If Lin Yun hadn't known the plot of "A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality," who could have guessed that this seemingly timid little old man was actually a Nascent Soul powerhouse?

"Alas—this old man has no choice. I can't give up that slim hope of reaching Foundation Establishment," Xiang Zhili sighed, his face filled with desolation.

"Alas—" Lin Yun sighed as well and patted Xiang Zhili on the shoulder. "Surviving is what matters most."

While handing Xiang Zhili a high-grade primary talisman, Lin Yun also secretly slipped him a top-tier defensive magic tool.

"Shh—don't make a fuss," Lin Yun gestured, signaling Xiang Zhili not to get too excited.

"This..." Xiang Zhili was both amused and touched. This Lin Yun was truly a good man. In all his years wandering the mortal world, this was the first time he had met someone so handsome and kind-hearted.

[Ding! Host has gifted friend Xiang Zhili a high-grade primary talisman, triggering "Give a Plum, Receive a Peach."]

[Ding! Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Giant Spirit Claw Talisman.]

[Treasure Description: A talisman containing a strike from a Nascent Soul cultivator.]

"Wow—this is amazing! With this talisman, I finally have a means to deal with Nascent Soul cultivators!" Lin Yun was overjoyed when he saw the system notification.

Though he had many items on him, if a Nascent Soul cultivator truly wanted to deal with him, he would have been helpless—most of those items were too advanced for him to use. This talisman came at the perfect time, solving his urgent problem. While it didn't mean he could rest easy, it at least eased his worries significantly.

[Ding! Host has gifted friend Xiang Zhili the top-tier defensive magic tool Yellow Cloud Mirror, triggering "Give a Plum, Receive a Peach."]

[Ding! Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Spirit Treasure - Crimson Sun Jade Ruyi.]

[Treasure Description: A defensive spirit treasure left behind in the mortal world by a cultivator from the Spirit Realm. It possesses miraculous effects in resisting spatial forces.]

"Hahaha—this batch of dumplings was definitely worth it!" Lin Yun's mood soared as he read the system notifications. To avoid arousing Xiang Zhili's suspicion, he also secretly gave another top-tier defensive magic tool to a young eleventh-level Qi Refinement cultivator nearby.

When he reached Han Li, Lin Yun patted him on the shoulder and said earnestly, "Xiao Li, with only the eleventh level of Qi Refinement, why must you enter the Bloody Forbidden Land? Stay safely in the valley, and I'll bring back Foundation Establishment Pills for you."

"Brother Lin!" Han Li was deeply moved, but he still clasped his fists and declined the offer. "Brother Lin, some things must be done by oneself."

"Alas—you! Ever since I met you, you've been this stubborn and headstrong. I know I can't persuade you."

"Here, take this Sky Thunder Seed and a Treasure Talisman for protection." Lin Yun pressed them into Han Li's hands.

To avoid suspicion, he gave Han Li a different Treasure Talisman, not the Golden Light Brick. In any case, given Lin Yun's relationship with Chen Qiaoxian, it wouldn't be unusual for her to have bought it for his protection.

"Brother Lin—this—what about you?" Han Li was so moved that his eyes grew moist. Lin Yun was even kinder than his own elder brother!

"I have spares." Lin Yun showed Han Li two more Treasure Talismans in his possession. "Take them. Protect yourself. Even if you can't find spirit herbs, surviving is what matters most."

"Thank you, Brother Lin! Han Li will not refuse this kindness." Though Han Li already had top-tier magic tools, he genuinely lacked high-grade defensive items. Now, his arsenal was complete. "After I come out, I'll find a way to repay Brother Lin with some spirit herbs—consider it payment in spirit stones," Han Li resolved inwardly.

[Ding! Host has gifted friend Han Li a Sky Thunder Seed, triggering "Give a Plum, Receive a Peach."]

[Ding! Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Green Fire Thunder x1.]

[Treasure Description: A secret explosive crafted by the Qingyang Sect of the Devil Dao in the Chaotic Star Sea. Each one consumes vast amounts of rare materials and takes an extremely long time to refine. Its power rivals the Primordial Flame of a Nascent Soul cultivator.]

[Ding! Host has gifted friend Han Li the Treasure Talisman - Golden Yuan Sword, triggering "Give a Plum, Receive a Peach."]

[Ding! Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Nascent Soul Treasure Talisman - Azure Nether Needle.]

[Treasure Description: Crafted by Nascent Soul cultivator Qing Yizi of the Southern Crane Island in the Chaotic Star Sea. Its power surpasses ordinary magic treasures by several times. Originally gifted by Qing Yizi in the Void Sky Hall.]

"Two more Nascent Soul-level items." Lin Yun's heart swelled with joy at the system notifications. His safety had just been elevated another notch. With these two items, unless he encountered someone like Wen Tianren—who could nearly rival a Nascent Soul cultivator—he could rely on them to preserve his life. Combined with the Giant Spirit Claw Talisman obtained from Xiang Zhili, who would dare mess with him now?

"Is this kid really this generous?" Li Huayuan was surprised to see Lin Yun distributing high-grade primary talismans to everyone, with special attention given to the three eleventh-level Qi Refinement cultivators. If Lin Yun was truly this accommodating, Li Huayuan had an idea—he'd discuss it with him later on the journey.

After the distribution, Lin Yun and the others boarded Li Huayuan's "public carriage"—the Silver-Armored Horned Python—and soared into the sky toward the Bloody Forbidden Land.

Mid-flight, Lin Yun was organizing his system inventory. He had acquired quite a bit of junk recently and needed to categorize it for easier disposal later. Just then, he received a transmission from Li Huayuan.

"Kid Lin, come up here. I have an important matter to discuss with you," Li Huayuan said solemnly.

"Hmm? What does Li Huayuan want with me?" Lin Yun was puzzled but replied directly, "Elder Li, you can speak openly."

"Ahem—come up here. This matter is sensitive and shouldn't be overheard." Li Huayuan coughed awkwardly.

Matters like scheming against Fellow Daoist Fuyunzi were too embarrassing for Li Huayuan to discuss openly in front of the Qi Refinement disciples—he still had some pride.

"What's this about? I don't recall this happening in the original plot," Lin Yun muttered to himself.

He then walked over to Li Huayuan's side. The other Yellow Maple Valley disciples watched enviously as Lin Yun stood shoulder-to-shoulder with a Core Formation elder.

"Senior Brother Xiang, when will we ever earn the respect of a Core Formation elder like Senior Brother Lin?" the young eleventh-level Qi Refinement disciple beside Xiang Zhili asked wistfully.

"Hahaha—" Xiang Zhili chuckled wryly and shook his head. "This old man is just an ordinary Qi Refinement cultivator, far from the terrifying power of a Core Formation expert. I wouldn't know."

Meanwhile, Lin Yun listened to Li Huayuan's transmission. After hearing it, he smirked and said, "Elder Li, why involve a mere Qi Refinement cultivator like me in a bet between Core Formation experts? Don't you know Fuyunzi is a Core Formation elder? What if he takes his anger out on me? Wouldn't I suffer unjustly?"

"Kid Lin, do me this favor. Fellow Daoist Chen and I are close! Last time, that damned Fuyunzi won my Iron Essence in a bet—you didn't see how smug and arrogant he was! Besides, with me protecting you, what do you have to fear?" Li Huayuan was practically begging Lin Yun. For a gambling addict like him, winning once was more important than anything.

After losing that last bet, Fuyunzi had lorded it over him for over a decade, forcing him to lower his head every time they met. Regaining his dignity was worth even swallowing his pride to ask Lin Yun for help. Given Lin Yun's talent in talisman-making, his status would soon rival—if not surpass—theirs among the Core Formation elders. After all, Yellow Maple Valley had several Core Formation elders, but only one talisman-making genius.

"Elder Li, that's not what I meant!" Lin Yun shook his head. "I, Lin Yun, have always been upright and honorable. I refuse to engage in deceitful schemes."

"So, the price must be raised!"

"Also, I only help my friends!"
