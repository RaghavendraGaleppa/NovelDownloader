# Chapter 48: Spiritual Talisman Techniques

Chu Ning looked up at Zhuang Yunde again, noticing that the man also seemed to visibly relax after Zhang Zhishi and the others had walked away.

Turning back with a smile, Zhuang Yunde said, "Finally gone. The Law Enforcement Hall is the last thing anyone wants to deal with in the sect. They'll make a mountain out of a molehill."

Chu Ning smiled faintly in response, though inwardly he found it rather amusing. Zhuang Yunde's fear of the Law Enforcement Hall probably had less to do with Qi Chongmao or any particular incident, and more to do with his usual dealings with the laborer disciples. 

Of course, Chu Ning kept these thoughts to himself and instead asked curiously, "Senior Brother Zhuang, who is this Senior Brother Qi you mentioned?"

"Missing," Zhuang Yunde replied dismissively. "It's nothing major. We lose a laborer disciple or two every now and then—some run away, others might have met with accidents."

Chu Ning pressed further with feigned concern, "Does the sect always investigate thoroughly?"

"You're overestimating things," Zhuang Yunde scoffed. "They're just laborer disciples. The Law Enforcement Hall goes through the motions each time, but they rarely find anything. Though whenever this happens, they do increase patrols between the sect gates and the market."

With a knowing smile, he added, "Actually works in your favor—makes traveling to and from the sect safer. Not that you need to worry much; bandits rarely operate near Qingxi Sect anyway. My guess is Qi Chongmao probably ran away."

"Ran away?" Chu Ning feigned surprise.

Zhuang Yunde explained, "Some laborer disciples can't handle the austere life here, especially when they realize they have no future in cultivation. So they flee to become honored guests of some minor clan or even live among mortals. Stupid, really—the moment they slip up, the Law Enforcement Hall tracks them down, and then... well, let's just say it doesn't end well."

Chu Ning nodded with an understanding sigh, though inwardly he mused, "They'll never find Qi Chongmao—he's already turned to ashes."

After a few more casual remarks, Zhuang Yunde took his leave. Chu Ning then leisurely made his way toward the sect gates. The past half-month's worry about Qi Chongmao's disappearance being discovered had now completely dissipated. If Zhuang Yunde was to be believed, the sect wouldn't pursue the matter too rigorously.

At the sect gates, Chu Ning met up with Qiu Shunyi and Lü Xingyuan, who were already waiting, and the trio set off for Qinghe Market. Along the way, Chu Ning noticed increased patrols by Law Enforcement Hall disciples but felt no concern—if anything, it eased his mind. The heightened security meant he could return from the market later without needing to be overly cautious.

Truth be told, the route between Qingxi Sect and the market was generally safe, with disciples traveling it daily and incidents being rare. But having experienced danger once before, Chu Ning had learned to be more careful.

The Cloud Sea Pavilion auctions were held every two months, so the market was noticeably less bustling than during Chu Ning's previous visit. The group completed their errands quickly—Chu Ning purchased some talisman paper and a few ready-made talismans before returning to the sect.

After parting ways with Qiu Shunyi and the others, Chu Ning headed straight for the outer sect. Though he'd visited several times before, this was his first time entering Mu Ling's courtyard. Their first encounter had been when she waylaid him on the road to rob him, and last month he'd only met her outside her residence. Now, he finally stepped inside.

"You came at the perfect time—I'm almost out of talisman paper," Mu Ling said urgently as she led him inside, having left her storage pouch in the room where she crafted talismans.

When Chu Ning entered, he froze in astonishment. The study-like room contained a central table bearing talisman brushes, special ink, several books, and stacks of paper—both blank and inscribed with talismans. But what truly shocked him was the floor, which was littered with paper ashes—clearly the remains of failed talismans that had self-combusted.

Mu Ling seemed to notice his reaction and gave a light, embarrassed laugh. "Ah, the talisman I was working on today was particularly tricky. Wasted quite a bit of paper. Let me clean this up."

Chu Ning's eye twitched imperceptibly. This mess was just from today's attempts? And she seemed completely unfazed by it? This young mistress wasn't crafting talismans—she was burning money!

As this thought crossed his mind, Mu Ling rummaged through the table and produced two talismans. "Found them—Cleansing Talismans."

Before Chu Ning could react, she activated and tossed both talismans. The extravagant display made his eye twitch again. Even he had learned the simple Cleansing Technique by now—surely Mu Ling knew it too? Using precious talismans for such a mundane task? The ways of the wealthy were truly beyond a poor man's understanding.

Mu Ling surveyed the now-clean room with satisfaction. "Much better. Oh, right—put the talisman paper you bought here." She gestured to the table.

Chu Ning retrieved the "purchased" 1,000 sheets of talisman paper from his storage pouch and placed them on the table. Mu Ling inspected a few sheets and nodded approvingly. "Good quality as always. Here's the spirit stones for next month's paper." She handed over 22 spirit stones from her pouch.

But Chu Ning's attention had been captured by the books on the table, and he momentarily forgot to accept the payment.

*Introduction to Talismans*
*Thirteen Basic Low-Grade Talismans*
*Fundamentals of Primary Talismans*
*Spiritual Talisman Techniques*

Spread across the table were four or five books—exactly the talisman-crafting knowledge Chu Ning had been seeking.

Noticing his gaze, Mu Ling's eyes brightened with interest. "Oh? Junior Brother Chu, are you interested in talismans too?"

Coming back to himself, Chu Ning nodded. "Since I know how to make talisman paper, I've been wanting to learn talisman crafting."

"I could teach you!" Mu Ling exclaimed excitedly, before immediately shaking her head. "Ah, but no—these techniques were given to me by my grand-aunt from the sect's collection. There are rules against me teaching them freely. Hmm... wait, I have an idea..."
