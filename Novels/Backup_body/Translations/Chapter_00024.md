# Chapter 24: He Qingyu Descends the Mountain to Earn Merits! Li Zhengjing Fights the Evil Cultivator Alone!

The minor official named Shen Shan was the sole survivor of the "thief" case from half a month ago!

This man had gone to a neighboring county to request the assistance of Commander Zhou, but he had yet to return. However, the evil cultivator might not know the full details and would likely keep an eye on his residence!

"The evil cultivator has been here for many days and likely recognizes the local officials."

"Moreover, his cultivation is not weak, making it easy for him to detect any ambush."

"Therefore, for this ambush, we don’t need the local authorities to send people. We, the inner disciples of the immortal sect, can hide in the shadows."

Chen Bing stood with his hands behind his back, his expression proud as he issued orders. The local magistrate could only listen and did not dare to speak.

At that moment, He Qingyu spoke up, "Senior Brother Chen Bing, we are unfamiliar with this place. We’ll need assistance to set up the ambush in the surrounding houses beforehand."

Lu Xiaoxuan stepped forward slightly and bowed, saying, "I grew up here and am familiar with all the neighbors. I can arrange things with them! Besides, although I’m a minor official in the yamen, I haven’t participated in the street searches, so the evil cultivator shouldn’t recognize me!"

His face showed no fear as he bowed deeply and said firmly, "My adoptive father was also killed by the evil cultivator. Tonight, I am willing to follow you immortals into battle!"

---

Night had fallen, and the moon hung high in the sky.

After a day of preparations, the impersonator of Shen Shan returned to his home.

Outside Shen Shan’s residence, the four inner disciples of the immortal sect each took a position, hiding in the neighboring houses.

Shen Shan had a wife and children, but to avoid alerting the evil cultivator, they had not been moved and remained at home.

"Immortal, do you think the evil cultivator will come?" Lu Xiaoxuan whispered.

"He might not come."

Li Zhengjing had a vague premonition in his heart.

Lu Xiaoxuan’s expression fell, and he said nothing more.

After a short while, he followed the prior instructions and left the area to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

But just then, there was movement. Li Zhengjing gripped his long, narrow black blade and looked in that direction.

A figure in white robes approached, clean and bright under the moonlight.

"Senior Sister He, what brings you here?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"I’ve already arranged for the White Wolf and Black Eagle to hide in my assigned direction."

He Qingyu approached and said softly, "The evil cultivator is too strong. Only Senior Brother Chen Bing can match him. The three of us are no match for him alone in a fight!"

"Senior Brother Zhou Mo’s cultivation is slightly higher, and he and Senior Brother Chen Bing are close friends. If there’s any movement, Senior Brother Chen Bing will immediately come to his aid, so there’s no need to worry."

She continued solemnly, "I came here to join forces with you."

Li Zhengjing smiled and said, "Are you afraid my cultivation is too weak and I’ll be killed by the evil cultivator?"

He Qingyu hesitated, not wanting to hurt his pride, and said quietly, "Because with your help, I won’t have to fear the evil cultivator."

"I didn’t expect Senior Sister to be so good with words."

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "You traveled here with those two from the sect. Logically, you should be working with them to slay demons and monsters."

He Qingyu shook her head. "I’m not like them. We just happened to travel together. Besides, tonight is dangerous. Aside from Senior Brother Zhou Mo, I doubt Senior Brother Chen Bing will come to our aid in time. That’s why I’m joining you—for my own safety."

Li Zhengjing fell silent for a moment before saying, "With those two spirit beasts, you could protect yourself just fine. Yet you still came to join me… Why?"

He Qingyu let out a soft "Hmm," then looked apologetic and said quietly, "I’m sorry."

"What?"

Li Zhengjing was taken aback.

"The spirit leopard that went berserk in the outer sect over half a month ago—I was the one who tamed it."

Her tone was complicated as she said, "The leopard nearly killed you."

Li Zhengjing suddenly understood, then waved his hand. "It wasn’t your fault."

The incident had been orchestrated by five stewards, including Chen Youyu. No matter who had tamed the spirit beast, it would have gone berserk.

If anything, this inner disciple of the Beast Taming Hall had suffered unjustly, being held accountable by the Law Enforcement Hall!

Thinking of this, he asked about her punishment.

He Qingyu sighed. "The Beast Taming Hall deemed my taming a failure and punished me with ten days of confinement."

"As for the Law Enforcement Hall, they fined me a hundred merits."

"I’ve been in the inner sect for over three years and only saved up seventy-six merits. Now I owe twenty-four."

"Until I repay the debt, I can’t exchange for any treasures in the Merit Hall. But the art of beast taming requires various tools, medicines, and different taming techniques!"

Her face showed worry as she said, "This is my first time leaving the mountain since joining the sect. I rushed here day and night to earn merits and clear my debt as soon as possible!"

"Wait a minute!"

Li Zhengjing frowned. "You rushed here day and night?"

He Qingyu looked puzzled. "What’s wrong?"

Li Zhengjing tightened his grip on his blade and said, "Sect merits can be exchanged for resources, which are extremely important to us. But for those forced to leave the sect, merits are even more crucial!"

He looked at He Qingyu. "The two who went to deliver messages to Qixing Prefecture and the sect have returned. The one who went to the neighboring county, Shen Shan, had the shortest journey—so why hasn’t he returned?"

He Qingyu paused, then said, "Maybe Commander Zhou was busy, and Shen Shan is waiting to return with him?"

Li Zhengjing said gravely, "But for Commander Zhou, sixty merits for slaying a demonic entity is a fortune he might never earn in his lifetime! You couldn’t wait and rushed here day and night—why hasn’t Commander Zhou come?"

He stood up and said, "Perhaps Shen Shan never made it to the neighboring county. He might have died on the way!"

"What? Shen Shan is dead?"

He Qingyu’s face paled slightly. "Then… he won’t come?"

If everyone involved in the case was dead, then after killing the two minor officials Zhang Yu and Zhang Chao last night, the evil cultivator had already achieved his revenge!

At this moment, had the evil cultivator already left, fleeing beyond the borders of the Feather Immortal Sect’s territory?

"But today…"

He Qingyu frowned. "I tamed three hundred birds, and none of them spotted anything suspicious during the day! If he fled, he shouldn’t have escaped my notice…"

Li Zhengjing remained silent, his thoughts racing.

The evil cultivator wasn’t here for revenge—he was after something!

If he hadn’t fled, that meant he hadn’t found what he wanted after killing the two minor officials last night!

"Where would that thing be?"

Suddenly, Li Zhengjing had an epiphany. "Lu Xiaoxuan!"

---

At that moment, Lu Xiaoxuan was enveloped in a chilling aura.

Before him stood a middle-aged man in black robes, his expression sinister.

"Your adoptive father’s belongings—you have them, don’t you?"

"You…" Lu Xiaoxuan trembled. "It’s you! You’re not—"

"Not supposed to be at Shen Shan’s house, surrounded and killed?"

The black-robed man sneered. "Do you think four greenhorns could ambush me? When I saw Shen Shan return home today, I knew it was a trap!"

"Shen Shan went to the neighboring county to deliver a message, but before he even left Wanlin County, I killed him!"

"At the time, I didn’t have time to chase down Zhang Yu and Zhang Chao, so I had to wait for them to return. But last night, I still didn’t find what I was looking for on them."

"After thinking it over, the only possibility is that it’s with you, an outsider!"

He grabbed Lu Xiaoxuan by the neck and said coldly, "Hand it over, and I’ll spare your life."

Lu Xiaoxuan shivered, his legs weak with fear. He had once sworn to avenge his adoptive father if he ever met the killer, even at the cost of his life.

But now, he couldn’t muster the will to resist.

"I don’t know what you’re talking about," Lu Xiaoxuan stammered.

"Everything related to the so-called ‘thief’ case half a month ago," the black-robed man said.

"That case had no physical evidence. The two thieves were beaten to death before they could steal anything," Lu Xiaoxuan said.

"I know there was no evidence—because it was divided among you," the man said calmly.

"Impossible! Anything involved in a case must be kept in the yamen! There was never any evidence in this case!"

Lu Xiaoxuan gritted his teeth. "My adoptive father would never—"

He paused, his expression shifting.

The black-robed man said indifferently, "Remember now? Let’s go."

Lu Xiaoxuan didn’t dare resist. He led the man to his home, opened the door, and found a hidden compartment.

Inside were the belongings of Constable Wu!

A land deed, a property deed, a broken blade, some scattered silver, three paintings, ten books, and—a black token.

"Finally found it."

The black-robed man picked up the token, his sinister face twisting with emotion.

Lu Xiaoxuan trembled, his eyes wide with disbelief.

Ten days ago, his adoptive father had given him the token, calling it a family heirloom—indestructible, impervious to blades, a rare treasure.

When his five-year term was up, he could present the token to an outer sect steward during the entrance exam to gain favor.

"Good."

The black-robed man nodded approvingly, then looked at Lu Xiaoxuan. "Now you can die."

With that, his hand shot out, black as ink, aiming to crush the boy’s skull!

But just as he struck—

A cold light flashed in the darkness!

A blade descended from above—Five Thunder Mountain-Splitting Blade!

"Damn it!"

The black-robed man screamed and leaped back!

He retreated to the courtyard, his face pale, his right arm severed at the elbow, blood gushing.

"I’ve been crouching on the beam for a while now."

Li Zhengjing stepped out, blade in hand, smiling.

"You!"

The black-robed man’s face darkened. "Just you alone?"

As he spoke, he channeled his inner energy into his left hand and pressed it to the stump of his right arm.

The wound instantly necrotized, the flesh rotting, but the bleeding stopped.

"I came here early and sent He Qingyu to notify Chen Bing and Zhou Mo."

Li Zhengjing raised his blade, grinning. "They’ll be here soon—about half an hour. If you run now, you might still escape."

"Run?"

The black-robed man drew a cold iron hook with his left hand, his face savage as he lunged. "Killing you won’t take half an hour—three breaths are enough!"

"Of the four sect disciples, you’re the youngest and weakest. How dare you come alone to die!"

"You severed my arm. If I don’t take your head, how can I face the world?"

He activated his sinister arts, his inner energy turning venomous, his face twisting into a demonic visage!

As he closed in, his left hand swung the iron hook toward the young man’s head!

Then he saw the young man’s calm expression as he uttered a single word.

"Kill!"

With that word, sword energy erupted!

The energy pierced his chest!

Before the black-robed man could react, agony exploded in his chest, and he was sent flying, crashing to the ground.

"Every time I use the sword, I injure myself. Even the toughest body can’t take this…"

Li Zhengjing spat blood, sighed, and pulled out a vial, downing its contents.

After consuming the Five Elements Creation Ointment, he dragged his blade forward.

Standing over the black-robed man, he placed the blade at his throat and said, "You’re under arrest…"
