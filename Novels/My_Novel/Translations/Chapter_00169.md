Chapter 169: The Missing Noble Lady and the Dragon Banquet

Li Xian was worried about his empty money pouch, struggling to pay the Madam's fine. Although the Madam appeared gentle and charming, she was extremely vicious deep down. If he could pay off the fine, he would be more than willing to give it a try. However, he needed to be extra vigilant to avoid being used as a pawn.

"Big Sister Lin," Li Xian asked, "you mentioned earlier that despite your strong strength, you dare not confront the Flower Cage Sect head-on. Why is that? Is there someone even stronger among them?"

Lin Aoshan's pretty face flushed red. "They are a motley crew, and there are indeed some formidable ones, but that's about it. In terms of martial arts attainment and cultivation, this old lady could crush them with a single finger. However... However..."

She hesitated to continue.

"However what?" Li Xian pressed.

Lin Aoshan said, "Don't you know? The Flower Cage Sect specializes in abducting women. Their martial arts are extremely despicable, with many strange techniques specifically designed to counter women. If I were to face them alone, I would inevitably fall for their treacherous moves. Instead of wiping them out, I would end up captured by the bandits."

"And the Flower Cage Sect roams everywhere. If I were taken to an unknown place, wouldn't that be a disaster? Asking me to fight them alone, I don't have the nerve."

Upon first hearing of the "Flower Cage Sect," Li Xian realized that the world of martial arts is vast and full of wonders. There are countless strange sects and factions. After pondering for a moment, he felt that this was a favor he could help with.

After discussing for a while, Lin Aoshan was overjoyed; her trip was not in vain. The two made a pact, swearing not to betray each other.

Li Xian was thinking about the "three thousand taels," while Lin Aoshan was thinking about the "merit." It was a perfect match.

Lin Aoshan ate and drank her fill, then left the Martial Commandant's Hall. Returning to the Lin family residence, she found it empty and desolate. Not being used to staying there, she thought of renting a room at an inn. However, as the young mistress of the Lin family, that would be too much of a come-down. She turned back to the Martial Commandant's Hall and stayed there temporarily.

Li Xian had someone clear out a guest room, located next to Luo Xia's. The two women felt sticky and sweaty from the late night and wanted to take a bath. Lin Aoshan had ridden hard, her sweat soaking through her clothes. Luo Xia had been practicing spear techniques and training the attendants, with a huge amount of exercise. Fortunately, the bathhouse was large enough to accommodate them both.

Li Xian rode back to the manor. He practiced martial arts in the courtyard. Around midnight, the Madam sent Qiuyue to summon him into the inner courtyard to share a bath under the sweet dew.

Tonight, the moon was as round as a plate, its light pouring down, creating a beautiful scene. There was also an open-air hot spring in the bathroom. Medicinal soup was channeled into the spring, the steam rising like a fairyland. They enjoyed the pleasure of bathing together while admiring the stars in the sky.

[You shared a bath under the sweet dew. Proficiency in the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword increased by 398.]

At the second watch of the chou hour (1-3 AM), dark clouds covered the moon. The bath was over. Li Xian wiped the dew from his body, his long hair loose, and tied it up simply with a strip of cloth. His hand was wrapped in white cloth, another sword mark on his palm. Although the Madam was peerlessly beautiful and a seductress of the mortal world, bathing with her brought more suffering than pleasure.

During the bath, the Madam would sometimes say, "You are like a piece of wood. Do you find me unattractive? If you are so useless, I shall just cut it off." Other times she would say, "How dare you have impure thoughts? You have such audacity." She always had something to say, making her difficult to serve. The Madam not only demanded Li Xian's loyalty but also wanted to control his lustful thoughts.

Li Xian strolled around the manor with an open mind. Having glimpsed the Madam's intentions, he carefully cooperated. He walked to the side of the lake. A strong gust of wind blew, scattering the clouds covering the moon. Li Xian held a stone and played at skipping stones on the lake.

"Although she is difficult to serve, the benefits to me are real. My Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword has improved rapidly, and my physique and internal energy... have all benefited. After these few baths, I feel a surge of vitality, full of energy."

"Moreover, as long as I make steady progress and never stop, there will always be a day for counter-restraint. There will always be a day to... subdue the Madam. There are endless beauties under the sky; only with sufficient strength can one appreciate and enjoy them. Before that, I just need to lie low and progress."

"The Madam will go into seclusion tomorrow, she said it was to prepare for... the Dragon Banquet. Speaking of which, what is the Dragon Banquet? Are there really dragon beasts in the world? To watch dragons and eat a banquet? That is quite an elegant pastime."

"She said that if my Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword can reach Minor Success in the second level, she will take me along. My second level is already proficient, and Minor Success is within reach. It should be good to go and broaden my horizons."

Li Xian's mind was calm. He plucked a blade of grass from the lakeside,叼 it in his mouth, and hummed a little tune as he walked back to his courtyard.

Knowing the pros and cons, and enjoying the benefits while enduring the harms, his mind was as firm as iron, his steps steady.

The next day.

At the Martial Commandant's Hall, Luo Xia was training the attendants. Lin Aoshan sat under a tree with her legs crossed, watching. She nodded from time to time, feeling that Luo Xia was mysterious, but there was no need to ask.

Lin Aoshan was startled. Seeing Li Xian return, she couldn't help but mutter to herself that this Martial Commandant was indeed a rare beauty.

"Big Sister Lin, please tell me the specific situation of the Flower Cage Sect!" Li Xian got straight to the point.

"Direct!" Lin Aoshan laughed. Li Xian, Lin Aoshan, and Luo Xia entered the room to discuss.

Lin Aoshan said, "Actually, I don't know the exact location of the Flower Cage Sect right now. I only have a vague idea that their general area is around Qingning County."

Li Xian asked, "So the Flower Cage Sect fled all the way from Huaiyin Prefecture?"

Lin Aoshan said, "That's right. I originally brought a dozen or so attendants from the Celestial Patrol Bureau and intercepted them in the Glass Mountain area. Glass Mountain is a famous divine mountain in the Nanyu region. Speaking of which, the scenery is quite nice... Ahem, I'm getting off topic."

Lin Aoshan took a sip of water and continued vividly, "I waited nearby for a long time but didn't see a single person. So I dismissed the attendants and returned to the prefecture city alone."

"On the way, I passed a Feiyun Plank Road and happened to encounter a group of Flower Cage Sect villains."

"This old lady is naturally beautiful. If I were to confront them, it wouldn't be me looking for trouble, but they would definitely join forces to capture me. I didn't dare approach recklessly, only listening from a distance. They were discussing their direction at the time, and someone was quite resourceful."

"That person said: 'We are surrounded on all sides now, and everywhere is extremely dangerous. I know of a place where we can seek refuge, resume our old trade, and wait for the situation to unfold.'"

Another person asked: "What place is that?"

That person said: 'I intentionally inquired about places of turmoil and found a county called Qingning in the impoverished Tianfu region. The Martial Commandant of this county, for some reason, claimed to be acting on heaven's behalf to punish officials and beheaded the local county magistrate. This place is a mixed bag of dragons and snakes, full of chaos. If we flee there, we can recuperate, observe the situation, and then slowly decide our next move. Wouldn't that be excellent?'"

Lin Aoshan deliberately lowered her voice to imitate the other party's tone while speaking.

Li Xian thought to himself: "The Flower Cage Sect is quite calculating, but although I beheaded the county magistrate, Qingning County is not chaotic." He asked: "Then you didn't track them anymore?"

Lin Aoshan nodded. "If I continued tracking, I would definitely be exposed. They are a mixed bunch with all sorts of means. I want to earn merit, but I'm not willing to risk my life for it."

Luo Xia smiled and said, "You are quite cautious."

"Of course," Lin Aoshan replied, looking at Li Xian. "I've explained the specific situation. The Flower Cage Sect is definitely nearby. What do you think?"

Li Xian pondered for a moment and said, "The top priority is to lure this sect out. They came to Qingning to 'resume their old trade,' and they will definitely abduct women from the surrounding areas during their stay."

"Before we find their specific location, Luo Xia, you continue training the attendants. Big Sister Lin, you come with me to investigate. Let's摸清 their foundations first, then take other actions."

Lin Aoshan said, "That makes sense..." She suddenly paused, frowned, and said, "Wait, I am a Celestial Patrol Marquis, how can I take orders from a little Martial Commandant?"

"Then please give the orders," Li Xian smiled.

Lin Aoshan thought for a moment. "Luo Xia, you continue training the attendants and be ready for deployment at any time. Li Xian, you come with me to investigate in the city to see if any women have gone missing."

She paused and added, "Let's摸清 their foundations first, then seek other actions. We must strike decisively and crush the enemy's throat!"

Li Xian and Luo Xia smiled and said, "Agreed."

That noon.

Li Xian wore plain clothes and applied a slight disguise, hiding the red mole on his forehead. He guessed that since the Flower Cage Sect could think of hiding in a chaotic place, even though their plan had failed, their train of thought was correct. There must be someone among them who was good at planning and had a clear mind. Since they were stationed around Qingning, they would definitely pay attention to the Martial Commandant's appearance and movements.

After making full preparations, he went out to investigate incognito. Lin Aoshan said, "The Flower Cage Sect may be scum, but this sect has good taste."

"The women they abduct must be as beautiful as flowers. And their family background must be decent. Ordinary peasant families, even if they offered themselves, might not catch their eye."

Li Xian smiled. "So they are snobs?"

Lin Aoshan said, "Putting it that way, it really is the case."

"You said they abduct women, what exactly are they trying to do? Is it lust?" Li Xian asked.

Lin Aoshan捏着 her chin. "Beauty is only one aspect; it's also for money. Alas, there are all sorts of strange people in this world. How can we possibly figure out all their motives?"

Li Xian understood. Zeng Taian of the Fulai Manor had a癖好 for exotic birds and beasts. He immediately stopped asking more questions and focused on探寻 clues.

Based on his nature, he should start investigating from the noble families. If a daughter of a family goes missing, it must be the work of the Flower Cage Sect. The noble families in Qingning County are the "Lin," "Luo," "Zhao," and "Wang" families.

Li Xian went to the Wang family first. But just as he was about to knock on the door, he stopped and pulled Lin Aoshan away.

Lin Aoshan asked, "What are you doing?"

Li Xian said, "It's not right. Going to the door directly is highly inappropriate."

"Hmph, you're being paranoid," Lin Aoshan said. "We are disguised. Are you afraid of being recognized by passersby?"

"Not afraid of passersby, but afraid of being recognized by the household servants," Li Xian said.

"What do you mean?" Lin Aoshan asked.

Li Xian pulled her into a hidden alley and pointed at the Wang family's mansion. "If the Flower Cage Sect sets their sights on a Wang family woman, would they storm the mansion and kidnap her by force, or use insidious schemes to capture her secretly?"

"The latter, of course," Lin Aoshan thought for a moment.

"Since it's the latter, it's highly likely that the Flower Cage Sect has planted household servants in the major families," Li Xian said. "First, they can scout for beautiful women. Second, they can keep track of movements."

"If we go to the door to inquire, we will definitely be seen by the spy servants. By then, we will have alerted the snake. How would you find the Flower Cage Sect then?"

"Ah!" Lin Aoshan was startled, patted her chest, and said thankfully, "I really didn't think of that. Little Brother Li, you are really smar..."

Lin Aoshan's seniority in her clan was very high. Just as she was about to praise Li Xian's intelligence, she unconsciously assumed her "grandma" stance and changed her tone. "Hmm... keep up the good work, don't get cocky. I was just testing you. Not bad, not bad, you passed the test."

"What do we do now?" Lin Aoshan asked.

"Let's play it safe," Li Xian said. "Wait until nightfall. We will pretend to be thieves and break into the mansion. After some questioning, we can find out if any daughters of the family are missing. That way, we definitely won't attract the attention of the Flower Cage Sect."

"Besides..."

Li Xian's pockets were empty, he was so poor he dreamed of money. He really wanted to顺便 take something.
