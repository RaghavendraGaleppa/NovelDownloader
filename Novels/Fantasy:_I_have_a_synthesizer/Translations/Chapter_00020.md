**Chapter 20: Late Qi and Blood Realm, Instantly Killing a Blood Refining Realm Expert!**

Late Qi and Blood Realm!

After that moment of enlightenment, Su Yu successfully refined the wisp of yellow energy. His Qi and Blood surged by another three points, successfully reaching nine points! This meant he had entered the Late Qi and Blood Realm! Once Su Yu cultivated his Qi and Blood to ten points, he would be able to break through to the Blood Refining Realm and reach a new height!

The Blood Refining Realm martial artist from the Heavenly God Sect watched Su Yu open his eyes, a shiver of fear running through him. However, when he sensed that Su Yu's Qi and Blood was merely at nine points, he scoffed.

"A mere Qi and Blood Realm martial artist, even if he's advanced to the late stage, what kind of waves can he possibly stir?" he sneered. "To think I was actually intimidated by a measly Qi and Blood Realm cultivator. If I don't kill you, my anger will be hard to quell!"

The black-robed man advanced towards Su Yu with a sinister grin, his Qi and Blood instantly erupting. Faintly, a thin layer of blood mist seemed to envelop his body, and that terrifying pressure emanated directly from it.

Su Yu's brows twitched slightly as he felt it. "Is this how strong the pressure from the Blood Refining Realm is?"

Meanwhile, Liu Kuang could only let out a roar of impotent rage. The more enraged Liu Kuang became, the more excited the experts of the Heavenly God Sect grew.

"Hahahaha, today, the human race's prodigies are doomed!" All the Heavenly God Sect experts' eyes blazed with intense light. That was a golden prodigy! Enough to ensure their carefree lives for the rest of their days, perhaps even allowing them to reach more powerful realms. This was why they dared to directly invade a human city!

At this moment, Liu Kuang and Dong Buwei were filled with anxiety. They only wanted to quickly defeat their current opponents and then go to Su Yu's aid! Only by doing so could they foil all of the Heavenly God Sect's plans! But the Heavenly God Sect members were not fools. They didn't engage in head-on clashes, choosing instead to merely stall. The longer the delay, the more benefits they stood to gain.

Su Yu calmly watched the Heavenly God Sect expert charging towards him. The terrifying fluctuation of Qi and Blood alone made his cheeks ache slightly. Even so, the light in Su Yu's eyes grew even brighter.

The next moment, just as the Heavenly God Sect expert's punch was about to land, Su Yu finally moved. His white clothes fluttered in the wind, like a white scroll unfurling. With a subtle movement of his hands, a Tai Chi-like pattern materialized before him.

However, the moment the black-robed expert's words fell, a soft ripple of energy spread out from Su Yu's battle.

Everyone paused their fights and looked towards them. But the instant they clearly saw what had happened, the faces of numerous Heavenly God Sect experts dramatically changed.

"How is this possible!" an expert in the Viscera Refining Realm exclaimed, his face filled with utter disbelief.

There, Su Yu stood, holding a green blade. On the blade, one could almost feel the gentle movement of the wind, carrying with it a sharp aura.

"It's a spiritual artifact!"

"How can this be! A mere Qi and Blood Realm martial artist can wield a spiritual artifact!" The Viscera Refining Realm expert's eyes were wide with rage and disbelief.

And at Su Yu's feet, was none other than the corpse of the Blood Refining Realm expert from before.
