# Chapter 208: Jade Talisman's Anomaly

My brow faintly felt hot.

The chaotic-colored Dao Seal, originating from the inheritance of the Primordial Origin Realm, began to emerge uncontrollably, immediately followed by a brilliant purple hue covering it.

In a haze of consciousness, the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Immortal Seed instinctively began to tremble, six-colored light flowing incessantly. The Heaven-Penetrating Immortal Eyes suddenly opened.

In an instant, through that faint connection, Zhang Jing vaguely saw a terrifying existence, coiled in the deepest reaches of chaos, resembling a primordial source. This existence had clearly transcended the scope of race and even living beings, devoid of concepts like life and death, directly transforming into a fundamental origin of the Great Dao.

It *was* the Dao, and the Dao *was* It!

Grand! Immortal! Immeasurable!

With just one glance, Zhang Jing felt as if he had seen the world's most fundamental and perfect rules; infinite Dao and principles surged and boiled within his heart. An uncontrollable longing suddenly arose from the depths of his heart, growing ever stronger. In an instant, it had completely consumed Zhang Jing's mind. He wanted to merge into it, to become a part of that most perfect Dao. This was the ultimate purpose of life!

Outside, Zhang Jing's expression was lost, his eyes devoid of divine light, and his entire body radiated a brilliant glow. Every strand of hair, every inch of flesh and blood, even his consciousness, all began to gradually transform into pure, flawless light, and a rich aura of the Great Dao suddenly emanated from him. A sense of ultimate fulfillment and great joy quietly appeared on his face. It was as if in the next moment, Zhang Jing would dissolve into the Dao.

However, *Hum! Hum! Hum!*

Inside his Niwan Palace, the mysterious jade talisman suddenly began to tremble violently.

Gradually, Zhang Jing's consciousness slowly regained clarity. But when he noticed the changes occurring to his body, a deep fear and despair welled up in his heart. Zhang Jing wanted to stop. Yet, once the process of dissolving into the Dao began, it seemed impossible to halt.

"Am I going to die?" A thought suddenly flashed through Zhang Jing's mind. "It's just a pity... I haven't yet reached the pinnacle of the immortal path, like the existence I just witnessed."

Just then, "Foolish child, why aren't you waking up quickly!" A loud shout suddenly rang in his ears.

At the same time, Zhang Jing felt an incredibly grand power erupt beside him, instantly severing his connection with that figure.

Time slowly passed.

*Whoosh—*

Zhang Jing gasped for breath, his cultivation robe already soaked with sweat. This was the first time he had sweated so profusely since advancing to the Foundation Establishment Realm.

It took him a while to recover. Only then did he raise his head, looking directly at True Monarch Yuanming, his grateful gaze tinged with lingering fear.

"Master, that just now was—" Zhang Jing stopped mid-sentence. It wasn't that he didn't want to speak. Rather, he suddenly discovered that in his current consciousness, there was absolutely no impression of what he had just experienced. He only vaguely remembered he seemed to have seen an extremely terrifying existence.

"You little rascal are truly ignorant of your own limits. With just a Foundation Establishment body, you dared to presume to glimpse the true form of the Grand Primordial Dao Lord. Even we, Heavenly Immortals, dare not gaze upon it for long." True Monarch Yuanming playfully chided him. "It's a good thing your master reacted in time, otherwise..."

However, the slight upturn of his lips betrayed his true thoughts, showing he wasn't as displeased as he pretended.

Just then, "Senior Brother, from your tone, it seems you're quite dissatisfied with Junior Nephew Zhang Jing. Why not just hand him over to your Junior Sister?" The goddess at the head of the right side suddenly stood up, saying with a beaming smile. Her gaze towards Zhang Jing unconsciously carried a hint of admiration.

As soon as these words were spoken, it immediately caused many other Heavenly Immortal True Monarchs in the hall to rise, their fervent gazes all falling upon Zhang Jing.

"Senior Brother, why not just let him come to your Junior Brother instead? Junior Nephew Zhang Jing and I have a predestined master-disciple relationship in the netherworld."

"Senior Brother Wansheng, you truly have no shame, claiming a destined connection with everyone you meet."

"Grand Senior Brother, your Junior Sister has never taken a direct disciple since attaining the Heavenly Immortal Dao Fruit. I think Junior Nephew is quite suitable. Why not endure the pain and let him go..."

"Senior Brother, you've always doted on your Junior Sisters the most."

"..."

For a moment, the Bronze Immortal Hall, which had just been utterly silent, became boisterous.

On the spot, Zhang Jing watched, dumbfounded. At this moment, the majestic image of Heavenly Immortal True Monarchs that he originally held in his heart quietly shattered.

"Alright, my disciple is still watching. What kind of decorum is this, you senior uncles and aunts behaving so unrestrainedly in front of him?" True Monarch Yuanming lightly chided. Then he walked directly down from the platform, saying with a smile: "Disciple, these are all your senior uncles and aunts. Come over, I'll introduce you."

"Yes, Master." Zhang Jing obediently walked to True Monarch Yuanming's side, curiously looking in the direction he indicated.

"This is your Aunt Yunrong, also known as True Monarch Bixia, the leader of the female immortals in our Yuanjun lineage."

"Junior Nephew greets Aunt Yunrong." Zhang Jing bowed respectfully towards the goddess with a colorful cloud immortal bun and a beautiful, spiritual face.

Opposite him, Aunt Yunrong smiled faintly, saying gently: "Junior Nephew, please rise quickly. Your aunt's grotto-heaven is located on Bixiao Island in Nanzhan Continent. If Junior Nephew ever feels wronged by Senior Brother Yuanming, just come to Bixiao Island to find your aunt."

"Or, if Junior Nephew is bullied elsewhere, also come to find your aunt. Your aunt guarantees to help Junior Nephew get justice." As she finished speaking, a hint of domineering intent unconsciously seeped into her voice.

"Cough, cough, Junior Sister, please mind your words and actions!" Looking at this junior sister who was still fixated on poaching disciples, True Monarch Yuanming couldn't help but lightly cough, reminding her.

"Alright, Senior Brother, don't worry, your Junior Sister won't snatch your junior nephew." Aunt Yunrong rolled her eyes at True Monarch Yuanming, then looked at Zhang Jing again, extending her slender hand, and a wisp of extremely light and agile azure cloud qi quietly appeared.

"Junior Nephew, this is Primordial Azure Cloud Qi. Keep it well. In the future, whether for comprehending the Dao of Primordial Pure Qi or for cultivating Primordial Azure Cloud Sword Qi, it will be useful."

"This..." Zhang Jing hesitated, instinctively glancing at his Master beside him.

However, before he could react, Aunt Yunrong directly pushed that wisp of Primordial Azure Cloud Qi into his hand. "Such an insignificant item, just accept it. As a true man, why are you being so wishy-washy?" Aunt Yunrong chided with a playful look.

Seeing this, a hint of helpless smile flashed across Zhang Jing's face. This wisp of Primordial Azure Cloud Qi was incredibly precious, far from the "insignificant item" Aunt Yunrong claimed it to be. However, Zhang Jing also knew that he absolutely had no room to refuse at this moment. He bowed again, gratefully saying, "When an elder bestows, one dare not decline. Junior Nephew humbly accepts Aunt's generous gift."

"Now that's better." Aunt Yunrong nodded in satisfaction.

Subsequently, "This is your Senior Uncle True Monarch Lingfang..."

"This is your Senior Uncle True Monarch Minghai..."

"This is your Aunt Baihua..."

"..."

Who knows how much time passed. Under True Monarch Yuanming's guidance, Zhang Jing met and acknowledged all twelve other Heavenly Immortal True Monarchs under Patriarch Yuanjun. Of course, in the process, he naturally received many treasures. Among them, there were also a few treasures whose value was no less than the Primordial Azure Cloud Qi gifted by Aunt Yunrong. For example, the Nine-Aperture Stone Embryo gifted by True Monarch Lingfang. This was a primordial divine spirit embryo conceived in a certain world, but unfortunately, it encountered Senior Uncle Lingfang and was directly taken before it could even develop sentience. It was the top-tier material for refining clones. It was even possible to directly refine a primordial divine spirit clone from it.

However, all the items gifted by these senior uncles and aunts were exceedingly rare and precious, which meant that Zhang Jing, currently only at the Foundation Establishment Realm, had essentially no use for them. As for selling them... that was even more out of the question. He knew better than anyone. These treasures were easy to sell but virtually impossible to buy back. Left with no choice, he could only set them aside to gather dust.

"What a fortunate dilemma," Zhang Jing shook his head, a faint smile flickering in his eyes.

Just as he was deep in thought, "Senior Brother, we've all given Junior Nephew a gift for becoming a direct disciple. As his Master, surely you won't give him nothing?" Aunt Yunrong said meaningfully.

Hearing these words, Zhang Jing suddenly sobered up. He was about to explain that his Master had already given him the apprenticeship gift back when he was in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm. Unexpectedly, before Zhang Jing could open his mouth, he heard True Monarch Yuanming say with a laugh: "Haha, I've long been prepared, so there's no need for Junior Sister Yunrong to worry."

Having said that, True Monarch Yuanming's hand suddenly produced a peculiar immortal crystal, faintly exuding a trace of Great Dao origin aura.

*Boom—*

Zhang Jing's pupils suddenly constricted. Not because he recognized the immortal crystal, but because... the instant this immortal crystal appeared, the mysterious jade talisman within his Niwan Palace began to tremble. This was the first time since Zhang Jing transmigrated to this world that he had seen the jade talisman show an unusual reaction.

"Origin Crystal? Junior Nephew Zhang Jing probably can't use this yet, can he?" Aunt Baihua glanced at it, then asked, confused.

"Haha, he can't use it now, but he'll be able to sooner or later." True Monarch Yuanming laughed heartily.

The next moment, the peculiar immortal crystal, called an 'Origin Crystal', in his hand quietly flickered to Zhang Jing's front, calmly floating there.

"Thank you, Master." Zhang Jing suppressed the excitement in his heart, then bowed again, saying gratefully. He extended a hand, and the Origin Crystal then slowly descended.

...

Not long after, as Zhang Jing walked step by step out of the Bronze Immortal Hall, its grand doors closed with a rumble. Inside the hall, it suddenly became completely silent. All the Heavenly Immortal True Monarchs' expressions unconsciously grew serious.

After a long while, True Monarch Yuanming broke the silence. "Esteemed Junior Brothers and Sisters, the reason I summoned you all this time, on one hand, was for the apprenticeship ceremony, which goes without saying. On the other hand, it's because Master previously sent news that the Great Cang Realm's Tribulation of Kalpa is about to begin. As the winds rise and clouds gather, the Heavenly Dao's Qiyun will converge upon certain prodigies and evildoers, to be used as slaughtering blades, sweeping across all beings."

"And this moment will be the opportunity for the Xuanhuang Realm to intervene. The major immortal Dao Lineages of the Human Race, and even some royal clans from the Myriad Spirits Faction of the myriad heavens, will all participate in this hunt."

"However, it is said that the Jianmu Realm and the Nine Underworld Realm have also set their sights on the Great Cang Realm."

"May I ask, Senior Brother, Master's meaning is..."
