# Chapter 213: Tit for Tat

From within the purple mist, a golden, resplendent ox slowly walked forth, its entire body covered in scales, and its two enormous horns sparkling brilliantly. Seated cross-legged atop the ox was an old man, a towering figure. His eyes, like two golden lamps burning through the heavens, shone forth through the boundless bloody aura. This old man was terrifying, akin to a primordial being emerging from chaos during the creation of the world.

"Esteemed sirs, would you perhaps grant this old man some face and temporarily cease your conflict?" the old man spoke indifferently from atop the ox, and the heavens resonated in harmony, the Grand Dao chanting alongside him.

"Ancient... Ancient Land!" An elder's mind was violently shaken, his body trembling uncontrollably. Finally, his eyes rolled back, and he fainted, no amount of medicine from those beside him proving effective.

"Ancient Land!" The crowd was also deeply shocked, all gazing at the old man. This elder was, surprisingly, from the Ancient Land, the Star Realm's foremost power. The Ancient Land was exceedingly mysterious within the Star Realm, having not appeared for many years. Even Space Node Number One was managed by its subordinate races. They hadn't expected to witness someone from it today.

"Tai Long, I didn't expect you to still be alive." A smile appeared on the face of the great figure from the Abyssal Prison as he greeted the old man seated on the Scaled Ox, seemingly an old acquaintance.

"Si Zhao, since you're still alive, how could I possibly die?" The old man, addressed as Tai Long, also chuckled. He dismounted the ox and slowly walked into the field. Everyone's gaze followed him, and an inexplicable sensation arose, as if the place where this elder stood was the true center of all heavens.

"How come I've never heard of these names?" someone asked doubtfully. These individuals were so powerful that, by rights, they should possess illustrious reputations in the Star Realm, yet he had never heard of a single one of them.

"Of course you haven't heard of them. In the era when these great figures roamed, your grandfather might not even have been born yet," someone retorted with a sneer, deeming the speaker brainless.

Si Zhao? So the great figure from the Abyssal Prison was called Si Zhao, a rather pleasant name. Zhou Tian mused inwardly. The situation before them had completely spiraled out of control, and no one knew where it would lead.

"Si Zhao, it seems you intend to stir up trouble in the Star Realm the moment you awaken. Are you declaring your return to us old fellows?" Tai Long walked to a spot not far from Si Zhao and spoke.

"How could I be so high-profile? It's just that after slumbering for several epochs, some juniors dare to stand on my head and order me around. What else can I do?" Si Zhao sighed, as if disappointed by the current atmosphere in the Star Realm.

"What exactly happened?" Tai Long frowned, his gaze turning towards the middle-aged man from the Abyssal Tomb. His eyes blazed, like golden light scorching the heavens, too daunting. They seemed to shoot out two world-shaking, dazzling beams of light, like flames of annihilation.

The middle-aged man from the Abyssal Tomb couldn't help but feel a jolt in his heart. He had never even heard of the names of these two old fellows before him. Only in some clan ancient texts did there seem to be a record of the old man riding the ox—an extremely ancient and powerful expert. He let out a cold snort, representing his last shred of stubbornness, but he dared not be too negligent. He opened his mouth and asked the three Abyssal Tomb Celestial Venerables, "What happened here?" He didn't know what had actually transpired here; he had merely received a message and thus rushed over.

"Ancestor Li, my son Yuan Chi died within this secret realm, so we came to investigate the truth," the Abyssal Tomb Celestial Venerable, who had first made a move, replied.

"The death of a junior in your clan is understandable." Tai Long nodded.

"Understandable my foot," Si Zhao sneered, speaking without ceremony. "Tai Long, have you lived so long that your brain's gone bad? A junior is incompetent and gets killed, and you dispatch clan elders to seek revenge? The Abyssal Tomb certainly puts on quite a show of power!"

"Impossible! My clan dominates the world. No one at the same realm can be stronger than my clan. Someone must have used underhanded tricks. If it were a fair fight, my clan wouldn't pursue it, but for using schemes and tricks, my clan will certainly pursue it to the end!" the middle-aged man from the Abyssal Tomb roared.

"Haha..." A burst of laughter echoed from that direction. The powerful expert from the Royal Court was terrifying, with divine chains of order spewing from every pore, his magical power peerless. He was extremely strong and straightforward, openly mocking. "Have we not walked the Star Realm for so long that you've forgotten our prestige? Now any cat or dog dares to claim they dominate the world."

"Compared to the Abyssal Tomb, it seems your Royal Court is even more rampant." A spatial rift opened, and from it emerged a being with deep blue skin and ripples in its pupils, like lake water. The entire void resonated with the sound of surging waves, and everyone felt a bone-chilling cold.

"Chaos Lake has also appeared. Is a great war about to break out?" Someone's face turned pale, as if they had caught a glimpse of the future: the heavens stained with blood, the Star Realm shattering. Chaos Lake was a forbidden land in the Star Realm, just like First Mountain. However, a sentient race lived within it—the very race before them, incredibly formidable, occupying the Fifth Space Node.

"Times have changed! Beings in the Star Realm are surpassing each other with every generation! Some powers might have been mighty in the past, but eras shift, and great cycles revolve. Even the most brilliant once cannot remain eternally resplendent. They will eventually dim, be surpassed, and even be buried! Their might won't last much longer!" The voice of the Royal Court expert was vast, ruthless, and exceptionally cold. His words were far from polite, seemingly revealing something, subtly hinting at impending major events or certain powers. Around him, figure after figure stood tall, all clad in ancient armor, silent and unmoving. Each emanated earth-shattering vital energy, staining even the starry sky a deep crimson! Though they remained still, like ancient fossils, they were incredibly intimidating. The void itself was cracking, and the starry sky trembled. The atmosphere was tense and oppressive; these were the Royal Court Forbidden Guards who followed him, possessing formidable combat power.

"Are you implying my clan?" the being from Chaos Lake roared. The starry sky trembled, great stars disintegrated, and extreme coldness permeated the air, freezing some weaker beings into ice sculptures.

"I'm referring to those powers that can't keep up with the times! Do you think Chaos Lake is one of them?" He spoke without reservation, meeting challenge with challenge.

Zhou Tian grew increasingly bewildered. Wasn't this just a revenge quest? How had it spiraled so far, even involving the demise of ancient great powers? This had nothing to do with him anymore. If something went wrong, they shouldn't come looking for him.

"Enough!" Tai Long let out a cold snort, and Grand Dao fluctuations swept across the area. Everyone couldn't help but retreat, only Si Zhao remained motionless, though a flicker of apprehension also crossed his expression; this old fellow had grown stronger again. "What does today's matter have to do with you? What are you crowding around for? Go back to where you belong!" Tai Long was incomparably domineering. From his seemingly aged body, an unimaginable might erupted. The starry sky rumbled, nearly tearing apart, as he roared without ceremony.
