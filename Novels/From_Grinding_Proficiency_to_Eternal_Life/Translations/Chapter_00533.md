Chapter 533: Cultivation Is Not About Contending for Immediate Gain

Xu Yunfan pondered within his heart. "If I must gather Qi, I must go to more dangerous extreme regions to seek a root Qi that is more compatible and powerful."

However...

Xu Yunfan thought again. Now that he was lying low within the Primordial Origin Sect, as long as he didn't go out unless necessary, why should he go through such hardship? He only needed to accumulate a bit of proficiency, cultivate the *Divine Skies True Sutra* to full proficiency in each stage, and he would be able to condense his Inner World on his own.

Of course, Xu Yunfan was not completely certain of this; everything still required him to test it. He was still young. Foundation Establishment cultivators lived for three hundred years. Counting the years he had cultivated and the time spent in seclusion, he was only a little over eighty years old. Waiting four or five decades to advance through the Attribute Panel was completely acceptable.

"I naturally cannot trust the 'opportunity' given by Qingyuan True Lord. But this root Qi used to condense the Inner World prototype is the foundation of my own Dao Path. I cannot allow the slightest carelessness or compromise."

Cultivating wholeheartedly and using the Attribute Panel to improve would naturally allow him to condense the most perfect and flawless Dao Foundation.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but let out a breath. The atmosphere within the three sects was currently strange and treacherous. The Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land was conducting the ritual to guide the King Buddha Throne in the Eastern Wasteland. The Primordial Origin Sect and the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect would never sit back and watch. If they succeeded and the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land established a terrestrial Buddha Kingdom in the Eastern Wasteland, wouldn't they become the sole dominant power in the future?

Who could tolerate that? It wasn't as if the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land was the only one with a Dao Lord.

Half a month later.

Deep within the Divine Skies Peak, the cave dwelling was secluded and profound.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on the meditation mat in the center of the quiet room, his expression calm and ripple-free.

Since bidding farewell to Lu Chuan that day and making up his mind to lie low and cultivate in seclusion, he had practically not stepped out of his cave dwelling once. All matters of the Divine Skies Peak were handed over to the attendant Dao boys to handle, and all visits from external guests were rejected with the excuse of "being in seclusion for cultivation, disturbing is not permitted."

This was no lie. To avoid taking risks and solely rely on cultivation to farm proficiency, he naturally needed to focus all his attention. His time was tight.

Xu Yunfan did indeed invest all his energy into cultivation. The core and main cultivation was the *Divine Skies Nine Chen Xuanqiong Immortal Destruction True Sutra*.

However, the cultivation process was not as straightforward as he had anticipated. Although the Attribute Panel was mystical, clearly marking the proficiency progress of the *Divine Skies True Sutra*, Xu Yunfan initially looked forward to it with anticipation. As long as he circulated the technique to cultivate and worked diligently without rest, he would watch the progress bar stably increase like a stream flowing into a river.

Yet reality gave him a heavy blow. Just as he had observed himself, the increase in proficiency for the *Divine Skies True Sutra* on the panel was terrifyingly slow. He had to cultivate diligently for ten or fifteen days just to increase one point of proficiency.

Every day, according to the essentials of the true scripture, he used the lightning attraction array to guide the Nine Heaven Thunder Qi to transform on the Divine Skies Peak, drawing the trace amounts of refined Thunder Essence floating at the peak into his body, circulating, refining, and settling it over and over again within his meridians and Dantian.

Xu Yunfan could feel his magic power slowly becoming purer and his Dao Foundation subtly consolidating. But when all of this translated into the jumping numbers on the Attribute Panel, it was slow enough to make one anxious.

On average, every ten to fifteen days, sometimes even longer, the number representing the proficiency of the *Divine Skies True Sutra* on the panel would extremely grudgingly jump up by one point.

He had calculated it precisely. Going from Minor Achievement to Major Achievement required one thousand proficiency points. At this speed, to reach the Major Achievement realm required to condense the Inner World prototype...

If the proficiency point jumps every 10 days, it would take 27 years.
If calculated longer, taking 15 days to increase by 1 point, it would require 41 years.
In the worst-case scenario, it might be even slower.

Twenty-seven to forty years.

To a Foundation Establishment cultivator with a lifespan of three hundred years, this seemed, on the surface, not entirely unacceptable. Xu Yunfan had comforted himself with this thought. Patience is the cornerstone of long life.

But having been accustomed to rapid progress in the past, his cultivation speed suddenly slowing down naturally made him feel unaccustomed to it.

Most importantly, if he wanted to cultivate to the perfection of Foundation Establishment, the *Divine Skies True Sutra* would need five thousand proficiency points to reach the perfect realm.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a sense of hopelessness, an impulse to immediately leave seclusion and go out to fight for opportunities.

Even more fatal was that based on the consistent laws of the Attribute Panel and his own cultivation experience, he clearly predicted that as the technique's realm improved, the barrier between each level would become increasingly solid, and subsequent progress would become more and more difficult.

It was very likely that after crossing the Major Achievement stage and condensing the Inner World prototype, the time required to accumulate another point of proficiency would multiply or even increase several times over.

This meant that the time consumed by the remaining 5000 proficiency points might be several times that amount.

Just thinking that it might take a hundred years, or even one hundred and fifty or two hundred years, just to cultivate this *Divine Skies Nine Chen Xuanqiong Immortal Destruction True Sutra* to the 5000-point threshold of Foundation Establishment perfection...

Even though Xu Yunfan's Dao Heart was firm, he couldn't help but feel a trace of its lengthiness.

Cultivation—breaking through only at the very last moment of one's lifespan?

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but find it absurd.

However, he was no longer a greenhorn just stepping onto the path of cultivation.

The遭遇 (encounter) of Chu Chengnan, his own situation, and the schemes of Qingyuan True Lord...

All of these were like swords hanging above his head, constantly reminding him that impatience is a trap, and composure is the king's way.

If he charged ahead recklessly regardless of the consequences, he might be able to enjoy a moment of speed, but without time to lay out his plans, he would likely be crushed to death when seeking the Golden Core.

Those True Lords of the Golden Core in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World were simply too despicable and shameless. They loved nothing more than to wear full god-tier gear to camp at the新手村 (Newbie Village) entrance, preventing anyone from leaving.

Furthermore, he had not yet figured out the situation inside the Primordial Origin Sect, and he knew nothing about the hidden secrets of the so-called "Great Opportunity" from Qingyuan True Lord.

The relatively closed-off environment of the Divine Skies Peak was actually the safest cultivation cradle at the moment. Secluding himself here to cultivate in depth seemed like a snail's pace, but in reality, the risk was the lowest, and it was the least likely to get caught up in unknown whirlpools.

Besides, the *Divine Skies Nine Chen Xuanqiong Immortal Destruction True Sutra* was not the only thing he was cultivating.

Long periods of time, for him, were not merely a consumption, but a capital to be fully utilized.

The preciousness of the Attribute Panel lay in the fact that he could cultivate multiple techniques and skills simultaneously on the same timeline!
