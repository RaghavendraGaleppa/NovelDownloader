Chapter 279: One Person, Two Sects

When he turned to look at Xu Yunfan, he saw his disciple’s expression as calm as an abyss. Seeing Zhan Yan looking over with suspicion, Xu Yunfan grinned, and the sound of gold and jade clashing flowed faintly between his vertebrae.

This was the unique phenomenon of the "Jade Bone Resonance" of the Marrow Cleansing Realm, which could not be faked.

What shocked him even more was that as the pores on Xu Yunfan’s body opened and closed, threads of mercury-like blood energy spontaneously steamed up, faintly resembling the movement of a flood dragon. This was a sign that only appeared when the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique was perfected!

"Master, in the Small World Secret Realm, I gained some fortuitous opportunities, allowing me to break through two realms directly into Marrow Cleansing."

Bi Yuan, standing to the side, heard this and nodded slightly. "Although the Small World Secret Realm is filled with demons and monsters, it is also a place where heavenly treasures are nurtured. Although the spiritual energy of heaven and earth has dissipated over the past two thousand years, some of it still remains within the secret realm. After so many years, there should be quite a few heavenly treasures available for picking."

Zhan Yan looked at the disciple he had once personally taught, and a complex, indescribable emotion churned in his heart.

He stared intently at the sound of gold and jade circulating along Xu Yunfan’s spine, the roar of mountains collapsing during the perfection of the Thousand Jun Hammer Technique echoing in his ears.

The blood energy steaming like mercury was the phenomenon of "Flood Dragon Marrow Transformation" recorded only after the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique was perfected.

Even if the Divine Weapon Ridge had been smashed to ruins, its legacy would still continue. For the past three hundred years, no one in his lineage had been able to reach this realm with the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique.

"Good... good!"

Zhan Yan’s throat bobbed, and his rough palm unconsciously clenched the teacup.

He remembered when Xu Yunfan had first entered the Casting Hall, he was still far from even mastering the Outer Three Unions. Now, that thin youth had actually achieved the Marrow Cleansing Realm and pushed the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique to a level of perfection that no one had been able to reach for hundreds of years.

The heat surging in his chest made his voice tremble. "The Casting Hall of the Heavenly Work Cave... has finally produced a successor capable of upholding the Ancestral Master’s memorial tablet!"

Fine cracks appeared in the teacup in his palm, and the scent of blood mixed with tea spread, but he was completely oblivious to it.

Bi Yuan rose to his long feet upon seeing this, his black Daoist robe moving without wind.

This grandmaster of the Ninth Realm of Qi Cultivation actually bowed deeply to Zhan Yan, the tassels of his jade crown almost touching the ground. "Master Zhan, now that the Divine Weapon Ridge is gone, there is no one left to cultivate Xu Yunfan’s Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique. The method cultivated by the Heavenly Work Cave Master, Hong Baichuan, belongs to the Master’s lineage and cannot be passed to others."

He straightened his back, his gaze burning as he fixed it on Zhan Yan.

"The Clear Weeping Mountain is willing to reserve the second seat of the 'Xuantian Pavilion' for him. Young Friend Xu does not need to change his sect; he can be a disciple of two sects. With this, I wonder if Master Zhan would agree?"

His fingertips lightly划过, and he effortlessly drew a scripture from his chest, none other than the Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock.

"This technique can help him refine his Flood Dragon Marrow blood energy into Jade Liquid. With the assistance of various rare treasures and secret medicines from my Dao Sect, he will surely perfect his Marrow Cleansing within three years and enter Organ Refining directly!"

Zhan Yan’s expression was moved.

He understood all too well what this meant. Even at the peak of the Divine Weapon Ridge, they could only rely on half of the Forging Bones and Melting Meridians Sutra to cultivate three Organ Refining Realm Elders. To this day, no one has reached the height of the founding ancestor, Ou Yezi.

Now, the Dao Sect was actually willing to take out their sect-defining ultimate technique, and without any demands, just to make friends, and without hesitation, to take out a true transmission ultimate technique of the Dao Sect just for a nominal title.

"Master Bi, what great magnanimity!"

Zhan Yan’s gaze swept over the faintly warm dragon scale armor at his disciple’s waist. He suddenly understood why even a figure like Bi Yuan would humble himself to make connections.

To be able to subdue a Eighth Rank Divine Weapon, to be able to walk through a Small World Secret Realm filled with demons and monsters, not only coming out unscathed but also gaining fortuitous opportunities to directly enter the Marrow Cleansing Realm.

From the perspective of the Dao Sect, they were naturally convinced that Xu Yunfan was a person of great fortune.

"Master Bi, do you know..."

Although Bi Yuan spoke with deep sincerity and earnestness, the thought of giving up half of his beloved disciple made Zhan Yan feel a sense of loss in his heart.

His voice was as hoarse as the grinding of rusted anvils. "After cultivating the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique to perfection, it should naturally connect to the Divine Weapon Ridge’s Eight Wildernesses Melting Furnace Merit?"

His emaciated finger pointed towards the sea of clouds outside the hall. "If those seventy-two forging platforms were still there, why would there be a need..."

The unfinished words turned into a long sigh, blowing the flame on the nearby copper lamp incessantly.

Xu Yunfan suddenly stepped forward half a step.

He said earnestly, "Master, you don't have to be so conflicted. If you are unwilling, you don't need to force it. I will not have a single word of complaint!"

To be honest, he possessed multiple ultimate techniques. Whether he joined the Dao Sect or not was of no consequence. Once he perfected the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Washing Technique, he also had the Sword Pavilion’s Empty Bright Cleansing Sword Technique to refine his organs.

A smile appeared on Zhan Yan’s face, then he shook his head slightly. "The Heavenly Work Cave is too small a pond. For you to be accepted as a disciple by the Dao Sect is a great blessing for the Heavenly Work Cave. For you, for me, and for the Heavenly Work Cave, it is a great thing. On this matter, your Master will make the decision for you and agree!"

One person, two sects. No one could find fault with this.

A smile could not help but appear on Bi Yuan’s face. The more he looked at Xu Yunfan, the more pleased he was. Such respect for one’s master and love for one’s teachings—who wouldn’t like him? To accept such a disciple, even if the Heavenly Demons were difficult to stop, it would at least allow the Dao Sect to pass down its legacy smoothly, and they could plan for the future.

Xu Yunfan did not refuse. This matter was, as Zhan Yan said, a great blessing for the Heavenly Work Cave, for him, and for his Master Zhan Yan.

The Dao Sect had the longest history. Although it had experienced several crises where its lineage was severed, it still stood tall to this day, and naturally had its own foundations.

To be able to cultivate in the Dao Sect, to truly learn the principles of the ultimate martial arts of the current world, and to truly touch the extreme limits of the martial path.

He could not delay Xu Yunfan’s path.

At this moment, he looked at the determination in his disciple’s eyes and slowly nodded.

The tea soup reflected his slightly reddened eyes, as if three hundred years of regret had been boiled into this cup of tea.

Zhan Yan looked up at Bi Yuan, a trace of relief flashing through his turbid eyes, his voice as hoarse as the grinding of iron sand. "Master Bi, aren't you going to accept the disciple?"

As his words fell, Bi Yuan was filled with joy, and the light in his eyes shone brightly. The thirty-six eternal lamps in the Bronze Hall suddenly flared up together, illuminating the mural of the Ancestral Master at the front of the Guest Hall with perfect clarity.

"Good!"

Facing the one who had returned to the main seat, his eyes were fixed on him, staring without blinking.

Xu Yunfan understood the hint and naturally wouldn't put on airs. He lifted the hem of his robe and knelt on the ground.

The force of the three kowtows made the bronze chimes hanging between the beams resonate on their own. During the final bow, the sound of gold and jade erupting from his spine actually shook the entire Guest Hall slightly.

He was sincere, and Bi Yuan naturally knew this.

Bi Yuan clapped his hands and laughed, a jade booklet flying out from his sleeve and landing before Xu Yunfan’s knees. "This is the first nine volumes of the Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock, perfectly suited for your Marrow Cleansing Realm cultivation."

"Thank you, Master, for bestowing the technique!"

Xu Yunfan took it and kowtowed again.

After the ceremony, Xu Yunfan suddenly turned to Zhan Yan.

He took the teapot from the table, and as the blood energy and劲力 in his palm exerted a slight force, the slightly cooled tea inside rapidly boiled.

When the cup of tea, reflecting the shadows of the master and disciple, was presented before Zhan Yan.

"Master!"
