# Chapter 415: Don't Go!

Outside, three suns hung high in the sky, observing the vast earth.

Under the light of the heavens, the peaks of the sprawling Mount Lanke trembled violently, as if some terrifying existence was about to break through the ground.

The martial artists in the underground palaces scrambled to crawl out of the entrances one after another.

Among them were the swordsmen of the Hengyun Sword City.

"What happened down there?"

"How could thunder come from underground?"

"The master of the tomb might have awakened and is fighting the protector by the Crown Prince's side," Elder Zeng said with a dark expression.

Even though they had already escaped, the swordsmen showed no signs of relief. Instead, they looked at the entrance with heavy hearts.

"Brother Li and the others are still inside," Bai Jinghong took a deep breath.

"No wonder he told us to stay put. It really is much more dangerous down there," Wu Chushu swallowed hard.

"But now, there are Profound Manifestation experts fighting down there..."

Cao Mu, who already had a sorrowful face, looked even more miserable.

A battle between Profound Manifestation experts has the power to destroy heaven and earth. It wouldn't be long before Mount Lanke collapsed. Leaving now was the best option, but the swordsmen of Hengyun Sword City moved against the flow of the crowd, looking back three times with every step.

Wu Chushu forced a smile. "Based on my understanding of Brother Li, maybe in a moment, the sky will boom with a loud sound, and he'll make a shining appearance."

In his eyes, Li Mo always managed to show off in all sorts of unexpected ways. This time would surely be the same...

Just as the thought crossed his mind, someone shouted, "Young Master Li is coming out!"

Elder Zeng, Bai Jinghong, Wu Chushu, and Cao Mu pricked up their ears and hurriedly looked toward the palace entrance.

Li Mo was safe?

Then...

They saw a figure, radiating divine light in its arms, flying out from the cave entrance. The commotion was huge because he was followed by a group of people, like a swarm of angry bees.

Including, but not limited to, Jiang Yu, the Patrol Sky Guards, Tan Zhuyin, and the Demon Summoning Sect disciples...

The crowd was stunned.

What exactly did Young Master Li do to be jointly hunted by the Crown Prince of the Great Yu and the Holy Son of the Demon Summoning Sect...

The swordsmen of Hengyun Sword City were close enough to clearly see how magnificent and mysterious the divine light was, like a masterpiece crafted by the heavens.

"Brother Li... did he obtain the divine object here?"

"What should we do?"

"Brother Li saved our lives. As swordsmen, we can't just stand by and watch!"

"But that's Jiang Yu and the Holy Son of the Demon Summoning Sect..."

The swordsmen looked conflicted. Elder Zeng touched the "Tyrannical Empress Falls for Me" in his chest with a complex expression.

"Get out of the way!"

"Don't be foolish!"

Li Mo, clutching the divine light and riding on the Somersault Cloud, shouted as he ran. The first sentence was for the onlookers, the second was for the people of Hengyun Sword City.

Soon, white clouds surged around him as he shot up into the blue sky, leaving only his back view to the others.

Not far away.

Amidst surging illusions.

"I've finally lured Jiang Yu and the others away."

"The swordsmen from the sword city didn't chase after them. Perfect..."

Li Mo rubbed his brow. Controlling the external avatar at such high intensity was quite a burden on his soul.

But before he could catch his breath, he saw Elder Zeng in the distance taking a black hood out of his chest and putting it on his head.

Li Mo: "?"

Bai Jinghong, Wu Chushu, and Cao Mu exchanged a glance.

Wu Chushu took out a few more black hoods from his spatial artifact and distributed them to the other two. These were spoils of war from when he had wiped out some bandits.

Thus, Elder Zeng and the Three Heroes of Hengyun instantly transformed from dashing swordsmen into fierce bandits.

Li Mo: "????"

Oi!

You guys... don't go!

He quickly sent a voice transmission. Elder Zeng's body paused, he scratched his ear, and a look of confusion appeared through the holes of the black hood.

Then, with a "whoosh," the few of them took to the air with their swords, their figures disappearing.

Good news: The swordsmen were very loyal.

Bad news: Damn, they were way too loyal!

---

What made things even worse was that the martial artists present looked at each other and actually started to follow suit.

They wanted the treasure, but they didn't dare to directly provoke the Crown Prince.

Disguising themselves took too long, and not everyone had secret arts, so they all chose the most simple and unadorned method.

Put on a hood, show no emotion.

The scene instantly became very chaotic, looking like a bandit team-building event in no time.

"What are they..." Qin Yuzhi was confused.

Li Mo scratched the back of his head with a headache. "...Probably, trying to make a big name for themselves."

"It's not a big deal. I'll just dissolve the external avatar early in a bit."

Qin Yuzhi glanced at the trembling Mount Lanke. The Yunmeng Underground Palace clearly couldn't hold on for much longer and was about to collapse. She gritted her teeth and said, "Then let's get out of here quickly."

With that, she closed her eyes, then scratched her head again and opened them. "Where are we going?"

"Ziyang Prefecture."

Qin Yuzhi placed a finger on Li Mo's brow and closed her eyes. "Close your eyes first and vividly imagine the place you want to go to in your mind."

"Okay, I'm imagining it."

Li Mo pictured the scene of Qiushui Pavilion in his mind and held the hand of the Ice Cube.

"Imagine again that nothing just happened. You are currently pushing open the door of Qiushui Pavilion. When you open your eyes again, we will already be there..."

Li Mo nodded and complied.

Suddenly, Qin Yuzhi's voice sounded in his ear.

"Push!"

Li Mo subconsciously pushed forward, and the sensation of a wooden door actually came from his palm.

Then, his body seemed to sink into water, rippling and floating in the current, and finally passed through a layer of rippling waves.

Li Mo first smelled the scent of wine and hot pot.

He opened his eyes and looked around. This was no longer the earthquake-stricken Mount Lanke.

It was the peaceful Qiushui Pavilion!

"We're really back?"

"My Dream Escape technique is unparalleled in the world."

Qin Yuzhi crossed her arms and raised her face proudly, then began to survey the surroundings.

This was truly no less than the Somersault Cloud.

Although the conditions for using the Dream Escape were more stringent than the Somersault Cloud, it had the advantage of being able to bring more than one person.

Ice Cube and Tian Miao also returned to Qiushui Pavilion.

"Wait, let me fully control the external avatar first."

Li Mo didn't even have time to check his investment feedback and quickly sat down cross-legged.

So.

A major event happened at Mount Lanke that day.

The fourth on the Hidden Dragon List, the Little Tyrant with the Divine Hammer, seemed to have perished!

...

Fifty miles outside Mount Lanke.

"I'm about to catch up..."

Zhu Renji, with his cross-eyed look, was from the Drizzle Building. He was not only skilled in the martial arts of the Yin-Yang Hall but also knew assassination techniques. His figure seemed to turn into Yin and Yang qi, hiding within the void.

"Kill him, and I'll get two rewards, and also earn the Holy Son's favor..."

"Die, brat!"

The clear and turbid qi of black and white converged on his palm and burst out violently.

"It's about time..."

Li Mo muttered to himself, actually making no move to dodge. He was incredibly calm, watching Zhu Renji's palm wind hit him, staring straight into those cross-eyes.

"Don't!"

A few pure bystanders wearing black hoods wanted to rescue him, but it was too late.

BOOM—

The figure of the Little Tyrant with the Divine Hammer was engulfed by the clear and turbid qi.

No matter how strong his Divine Observation was, he was ultimately no match for a fifth-rank External Scene expert.

His figure was instantly annihilated and disappeared.

Only a single strand of hair drifted down...

The bandit leader with "Tyrannical Empress Falls for Me" in his chest—Elder Zeng—let out a sharp scream:

"No!!!"
