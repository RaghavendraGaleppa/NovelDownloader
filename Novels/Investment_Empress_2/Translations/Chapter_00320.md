# Chapter 320: The Barbecue Poisoning Plot! The Siege! (Part Two)

"Siege! Siege!!"

Han Zhenqi’s eyes went dark with rage.

He had just expended ten years' worth of accumulated power of all living beings, forcibly bypassing the great army to connect with an abandoned Witch Spirit statue within the city.

He had expected to see the main force preparing for a desperate charge. Instead, he saw a massive number of logistics troops busily setting up various military machines.

The brat was clearly putting on a bluff!

Furthermore, he saw a General at the Inner Scene Realm use a Gale Domain to blow the barbecue smoke all the way to their position.

What were they doing?

*Hmm?*

Finally, the time for the assault had come, yet the army below didn't charge out like wolves or tigers as expected. Instead, they fell into a chaotic heap.

"Damn, I've been smelling this barbecue for half a day, are we finally attacking?"

"It's way too fragrant. I'm getting high off the smell."

"Someone has fainted from the aroma!"

"Medic! Medic! Our captain is foaming at the mouth!"

Han Zhenqi snapped out of his fury. He sniffed the scent of the barbecue, and suddenly, his expression changed.

At first, he was just puzzled as to how the barbecue could smell so good. But then he got distracted by the brat on the city wall and Ying Bing, not paying much attention to it. Now, he finally realized what was going on.

This barbecue scent was poisonous!

It was the Soft Sinew Powder!

This wasn't just an empty city strategy; it was a combination punch!

"That brat tricked us?!" The Master of the Hundred Beasts Hall stared fixedly at Li Mo on the city wall. He wasn't affected much himself, but the common soldiers were.

But honestly, as a member of the demonic sect, he had schemed against countless people in his life.

But adding Soft Sinew Powder to barbecue smoke, using the barbecue to numb the enemy first, then using the barbecue to numb the enemy again... such a bizarre method...

He was truly seeing something new.

"What a pity. Even if he is an enemy, that kid is indeed a talent..."

"I told you, the real 'colorless and odorless' isn't about having no smell, but blending into the environment so no one suspects a thing."

On the city wall, Li Mo raised his eyebrows at Huang Donglai.

Huang Donglai fell into deep thought and felt that what Li Mo said made sense.

It was time to improve his poison theory.

All his inventory, plus the dozens of boxes of Soft Sinew Powder Li Mo had bought, had been used up in this single move.

"Commander Qu, what comes next will be a hard battle."

Li Mo turned back solemnly and said.

"......"

The soldiers wiped the sweat from their foreheads.

"Brother Li has done more than enough."

Qu Sheng gripped the hilt of his sword. He wanted to take a deep breath but held back, shouting loudly:

"Soldiers, the enemy has fallen for Young Master Li's brilliant plan!"

"Men, the City of Qingmu lies right behind us. The Witch Barbarians are cruel. If the city falls, they will slaughter everyone, leaving no chicken or dog alive in Qingmu. We have only one path: to hold out until the King arrives for reinforcement."

"Years ago, the King fought alongside us to build the Qingmu of today. Now, with two prodigies, Young Master Li and the Frost Immortal, standing with us, do you have confidence?"

The soldiers on and inside the city walls immediately erupted with a thunderous response.

Down below the city.

The final stretch of time was finally dragged out by the Soft Sinew Powder.

*Woo——*

A massive horn sound shook the heavens and the earth.

After a period of chaos, the rear troops, who were largely unaffected, took over the task of charging. A large number of rams and arrow towers pressed toward the city.

*Boom—Boom—Boom—*

On the city wall, the Thunder Beast leather drums emitted rumbling thunder, like the heart of this massive city beating violently.

The sound of bowstrings snapping was incessant.

Large waves of powerful crossbow bolts, infused with the Inner Energy of elite archers, turned into fierce winds. Their piercing power was terrifying, capable of shooting through the enemy's vine armor.

As for the God Archers at the Divine Observation Realm, a Divine Intent floated behind them. Even Inner Scene experts had to be careful of their sneak arrows.

The area below immediately turned into a tragic hell. Many enemies fell to arrows, trampled into meat paste by their own comrades.

In a short time, two thousand enemy soldiers had died under the rain of arrows.

However, their screams were drowned out by the deafening horns and the beat of the Thunder Beast war drums.

It was their lives that escorted those heavily armed siege machines and Witch Spirit Colossi, slowly approaching the city walls.

The warmth and vitality of the previous second, turned to mud under the wheels the next.

This was war.

"Their role is to die, to use their lives to escort the siege machines and Witch Spirit Colossi to the city walls."

Qu Sheng, still organizing the defense on the city wall, watched the approaching giant shadows say.

However, his voice was drowned out by the killing cries of the battlefield.

"Flying Disaster Beasts are coming!"

Wu Lang roared.

This time, they weren't scouts, but elites led by high-level Disaster Beasts.

Their bloodline power was immense; a single one could scatter a unit of soldiers.

If they invaded the city wall, they would disrupt the deployment, destroy the archers' formations and other defense facilities, creating space for the enemy and siege equipment below to attack.

The next moment, a crackling lightning light appeared.

"Activate the Runes!"

The rune stones on the wall, embedded with Black Crystals, lit up with a dazzling light.

Instantly, above Qingmu City, patches of clouds became scorching hot. The lightning snakes cut them into golden lightning pools, forming a dense lightning net that sealed the airspace above the city.

Any flying Disaster Beast that hit the lightning net would be paralyzed and fall down, even if they didn't die. Then, they would be hacked to pieces by the soldiers.

Disaster Resistance Runes · No-Fly Zone!

"This rune formation consumes two Black Crystals per incense stick's worth of time!"

Wu Lang couldn't help but click his tongue.

He would never forget today. Young Master Li pointed to over a hundred boxes of Black Crystals and told him to use them freely, and not to fill the gaps with human lives unless absolutely necessary.

Damn, that was cool.

Wu Lang felt that if he were a girl, he would definitely want to marry Young Master Li.

A few flying Disaster Beasts broke through the lightning net, but don't forget, Qingmu still had high-level experts who could fly, and there was also that ice cube who could traverse the void.

*Crack——*

A severely injured Level 6 Disaster Beast was pierced by a sword energy carrying frost.

It turned into an ice sculpture, fell to the ground, and caused chaos among the attacking enemy troops below.

"Frost Immortal!"

The soldiers of the Qingmu Camp defending the city were inspired, and their morale soared.

Flying Disaster Beasts used to be a nightmare for the soldiers of Qingmu City. They came and went like the wind, impossible to chase, yet impossible to ignore.

Now, that breathtaking fairy figure, moving through the lightning net alongside Inner Scene experts, was terrifying to the enemy, but gave the soldiers unparalleled confidence.

In the future, when drinking and boasting, they could say they fought side by side with the Frost Immortal.

Li Mo almost had notifications ringing in his ear every second.

But he didn't have a moment to look at them.

A tall bronze ram was already close, and it had long been poised to strike. This blow was enough to shake the city wall.

The military crossbows of the Rongyuan Army had just fired a wave and were restringing, and the Thunderfire Alchemy Pills would blow up the city wall along with the enemy at this distance.

*Woo——*

A strong wind blew. The giant ram hammer fell, emitting a sharp howl.

"Get out of the way!"

Li Mo rode the Somersault Cloud out of the city wall.

His figure contrasted sharply with the mountain-like bronze ram. He looked no different from a pebble crushed by a sledgehammer.

However, the next moment, a golden light flared from his body.

Thin but unwavering.

---

*Clang——*

Golden Light Indestructible!

The immense force carried the figure along as it slammed into the city wall.

He plowed two deep grooves into the ground.

Li Mo's back was already pressed against the city wall; he could even feel the tremor of the wall. Finally, he forcibly stopped the ram's momentum.

*Clang——*

A loud sound.

He was enveloped by clouds and rushed upward. The number forty on his back emanated a sharp killing aura. He smashed into the mechanical connection point, instantly causing the ram hammer to crash to the ground. The bronze ram, losing its center of gravity, collapsed like a falling mountain.

"Young Master Li is mighty!"

The city wall erupted with even more vigorous cheers.

The morale of the Qingmu City side reached its peak.

"A Divine Observation Realm cultivator using his body to硬 a siege weapon machine?"

 "A秘术."

 Han Zhenqi searched his mind, He found that all the knew didn't match.

But what was more important now.

.

The soldiers of Qingmu City, high morale and fighting spirit because of Li Mo and Ying Bing.

On the other hand, his own side had fallen for the enemy's trick first, now their edge had been blunted, and they felt somewhat disheartened.

 "We must kill this boy first."

Han Zhenqi looked at Helian Wu beside him.

The latter grinned, revealing a row of white teeth.

"I've been wanting to test the weight of the prodigies of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths!"

He had long been restless. He slapped the scaled horned warhorse beneath him and charged out with his warriors.

Behind him, the Disaster Beast Witch Spirit avatars all connected to the bronze colossi and possessed them.

These war colossi might not be as strong as their main bodies, but even rampaging through the battlefield, they feared no damage. Each one could unleash power of the fifth or sixth level according to their respective faith power.

In an instant, the war cries caused by the vibration of metal cut through the noisy battlefield.

The soldiers who heard the war cries all had their eyes turn red, and their strength increased.

"Kill, die..."

Han Zhenqi murmured to himself. The mouth on his right hand was silently devouring the increasingly thick blood energy.

On the city wall.

"The appetizer is finally finished."

Qu Sheng's expression grew increasingly grave.

Witch Spirit Colossi.

This was one of the most powerful war means the Great Shang used to suppress the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. In the past, it could be driven by the national fortune gathered from all living beings, and a single one had the power to move mountains and overturn seas.

Although the national fortune of the Great Shang has now dispersed, it still cannot be underestimated.

"Rongyuan Military Crossbows!"

With a command.

One by one, intimidating weapons of terror were pushed out to the front line of the city wall. The cold, beast-like mouths pointed downward.

*Boom——*

The sound of the Rongyuan Military Crossbows was like a muffled thunderclap, a roar of death.

By the time you heard the crossbow sound, you might already be dead.

The target of the bolts was those sixth-level and even fifth-level Disaster Beasts.

Thunderfire Alchemy Pills were also tied to ordinary heavy crossbows and shot out, aiming directly at the bronze colossi.

The battlefield, already in full swing, entered its most intense and tragic phase.

After sacrificing one-third of the bronze colossi and a field of floating Disaster Beast corpses.

"Break through the Qingmu Pool, and we will no longer have to cower in these poor mountains and treacherous waters!"

"Take back everything that is ours!"

Having paid a huge price, the tactical objective of the besieging side was finally achieved.

The two sides engaged in close combat.

Disaster Beasts and warriors of the Southern Frontier tribes, using the cloud ladders pushed to the city wall, rushed onto the city top like a tide of hungry wolves.

The Witch Spirit bronze colossi condensed various totemic spirits. Not only were they formidable in combat, but they also seemed to bestow a power similar to Divine Observation Divine Intent upon every soldier who believed in them.

"Form the formations!"

General Qu Sheng handed over the command of the army formation to the Frost Immortal, whose mental fortitude and talent left him far behind.

Ying Bing stood on the watchtower at the center of the city wall, commanding the various military formations.

The various camps of the Qingmu Army quickly formed their military formations, relying on the power of the Disaster Resistance Runes on the city wall, constantly colliding with the enemy.

At this level of collision.

Even the domains of Inner Scene experts could not be maintained and would be shattered.

Inner Scene experts could only release their domains, harvest lives once, and then quickly retract their domains to retreat.

Or they could fight in pairs under the support of the military formations.

Qu Sheng faced off against the Master of the Hundred Beasts Hall.

"Li Mo!"

Helian Wu swooped down like an eagle. He stared intently at the少年 (young man) who was empowered by the military formation's strength.

"What the hell are you looking at?"

"Looking for a hammer?"

Li Mo's eyes flashed with the light of the Heaven's Fate Divine Eye.

The forty in his hand emitted a clanging hum. This玄兵 (mysterious weapon) was pushed to its limit.

.....

Evening.

The north wind howled like a knife, but it couldn't disperse the smell of blood on the city wall.

After repeatedly using the power of the world to drive the "Seven定定乾坤 (Seven Stabilizing the Universe)," a former prodigy of the Dragon Ranking was forever left on the city wall.

On the city wall, there were many people, but it was silent. Soldiers cleaned up the wreckage and corpses, all remaining silent.

Li Mo sat on the city wall.

His whole body ached. The Heaven's Fate Divine Eye stared into the distance. His ominous premonition was not wrong.

Han Zhenqi didn't care how many people died.

He didn't care which side the dead belonged to either.

Tomorrow's enemy assault would only be even more fierce.

"First Camp, two hundred and one dead, two hundred seriously injured."

"Second Camp, one hundred and eighty dead, two hundred and thirty seriously injured."

"Thunderfire Alchemy Pills remaining: half. Seven Rongyuan Military Crossbows destroyed..."

.....

Behind him, personal guards were reporting the military situation to Qu Sheng.

Li Mo's heart sank. Tomorrow's battle would be even harder to fight.

"Go eat something?"

A clear yet somewhat tired voice sounded in his ear.

Ying Bing was still in her Immortal Dress. She walked over while tying her black hair back.

"I can't really eat."

His numb nerves gradually recovered, and Li Mo felt his stomach churning.

"Be good."

Ying Bing reached out and gently tapped his forehead.

Although his spirit was exhausted and he didn't summon the Moonlight Aura, he felt as if he was being bathed in the tranquility of the moonlight.

.......

PS: I originally wanted to finish the battle in one chapter, but I was afraid it would be too late and the readers would be waiting anxiously, so I'm releasing the two-in-one part first.
