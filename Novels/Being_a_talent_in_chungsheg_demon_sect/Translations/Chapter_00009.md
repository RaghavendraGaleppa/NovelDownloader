# Greed Incites Hearts

"Fiend, are you in a bad mood?" Yun Miaoqing asked, looking up at Lu Yang, who was resting with his eyes closed.

"A little," Lu Yang sighed, casually recounting the predicament he was in.

"This is the Demonic Sect for you, treating its disciples as consumables, utterly devoid of humanity," Yun Miaoqing said, parting her red lips. "Fiend... Fellow Daoist Lu, your talent is good, and your temperament is excellent. Why humble yourself in this Demonic Sect? As long as you remove the restrictions on me and help me escape the Demonic Sect, I can introduce you, allowing you to become a disciple of my Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion."

Yun Miaoqing was looking for death, and he had no interest in accompanying her. When poor, one should focus on self-improvement. The top priority was still how to enhance himself.

After much deliberation, Lu Yang did not buy any Yin-Yang Immortal Blossoms. Instead, he spent all his wealth on 10 Great Qi Pills, which could increase cultivation.

"This life has pretty much reached a dead end," he mused. "After all, I neither plan to repay the loan nor am I willing to waste decades acting as an ox or horse. Once the loan term is up, I'll surely die without a burial place. Therefore, I must use this time to improve myself as quickly as possible!"

Lu Yang had already made up his mind: when he restarts in the next life, he would choose cultivation level. To achieve this, he had to quickly raise his current strength to a higher level.

"If my cultivation is too low, Liu Xin, who was present at the time, might see through me. So, at the very least, I need to reach the same realm as he was then," Lu Yang mused inwardly. "It must be at least mid-Qi Condensation, coupled with a breath-concealing technique; only then can I possibly fool him."

Lu Yang dared to think this way, naturally, because he was confident. This was because the Qi Condensation realm has ten layers, divided into early, middle, late, and complete stages. Within a minor stage, there were basically no bottlenecks; one only needed to accumulate enough energy to break through. What truly trapped many Qi Condensation cultivators were the bottlenecks encountered when breaking through minor stages. The difficulty of breaking through from early to mid-Qi Condensation, from mid to late, and from late to Great Perfection almost doubled each time, preventing countless cultivators from advancing even an inch.

"According to my calculations, 10 Great Qi Pills coupled with the cave dwelling's spirit vein should be enough for me to break through to the third layer of Qi Condensation. In fact, this is the cultivation level of most disciples within the sect; they rely on enduring time and accumulating seniority to advance, eventually getting stuck at the bottleneck of early Qi Condensation and becoming the Holy Sect's oxen and horses."

If nothing unexpected happened, Lu Yang would also be one of them. However, in this life, he held a variable in his hand.

With a thought, a wisp of misty, shimmering white Qi immediately appeared in Lu Yang's hand. Like an extension of his arm, it sometimes transformed into the shape of a sword and sometimes diffused into thick smoke.

Innate Primal Qi!

"According to Liu Xin, the greatest use of Innate Primal Qi is actually to help people break through bottlenecks. His breakthrough to late Qi Condensation must have been thanks to it." If Liu Xin could use it to break through to late Qi Condensation, then for him to use it to break through to mid-Qi Condensation wouldn't be a problem. "As long as I break through to mid-Qi Condensation, this life won't be in vain. At worst, I can just restart immediately. With higher cultivation in the next life, my starting point will be better!"

A moment later, a sound came from outside the cave dwelling. His Great Qi Pills had arrived.

Lu Yang pushed the door open, only to see a woman standing outside. She was dressed in plain robes, her beauty no less than Yun Miaoqing's, and her figure even more curvaceous.

"This servant, Qingchen, greets Junior Brother Lu," the woman said, performing a full curtsy. Then, she chuckled softly, her laughter seemingly possessing a magical charm that permeated the heart, making one involuntarily feel good about her. "I am here by order to deliver the Great Qi Pills you purchased, Junior Brother. Please present your token for inspection."

Lu Yang knew the procedure and immediately complied. As the two completed the exchange, Immortal Qingchen quietly probed, "Junior Brother, to be able to purchase so many pills this time, have you perhaps come into some wealth somewhere?"

"What are you saying, Senior Sister?" Lu Yang shook his head, a bitter expression on his face. "I've merely taken out several loans. I'm just hoping to raise my cultivation so I can take on some higher-paying missions."

"So that's how it is." Immortal Qingchen nodded, her face full of concern. "Junior Brother, you needn't feel inferior. Which of us official disciples doesn't carry a few loans? However... forgive Qingchen for speaking plainly, but Junior Brother, you still don't understand how to be flexible."

"Oh?"

Seeing Lu Yang's interest, Immortal Qingchen smiled faintly. "There are only so many sect missions. How could one possibly repay so many loans just by relying on missions? In the Holy Sect, if you only follow the ordinary path, it's impossible to get rich," Immortal Qingchen said softly. "This servant previously thought Junior Brother had perhaps discovered a cave dwelling left behind by some Senior Brother and gained a great inheritance, which allowed you to earn a fortune. That's why I presumptuously asked; I didn't expect it not to be the case."

"Cave dwelling..." Lu Yang's eyelids lowered, his gaze as still as an ancient well, yet his tone feigned interest. "This one is slow-witted. Please, Senior Sister, elaborate."

"Junior Brother, do you know that the Holy Sect was established within the 'Sky-Reaching Cloud Sea'?" Immortal Qingchen said indifferently, "Within the Cloud Sea, besides the four inner peaks, there are many other mountain peaks, all established by former true disciples and elders. However, the path of immortality is long, and over the years, people inevitably fall. But after their demise, their mountain peaks and cave dwellings are not withdrawn; instead, they remain within the Cloud Sea. Although there are certain risks, each one represents a serendipitous opportunity. Even a small gain can be exchanged for a large amount of contribution points! If Junior Brother is interested, this servant recently discovered a relatively safe cave dwelling..."

Really? I don't believe it! Lu Yang sneered inwardly. Immortal Qingchen's enticing manner was simply too similar to Liu Xin, who had tricked him into cultivating the Innate Dao Scripture in his previous life. This was clearly a trap! What cave dwelling opportunity? Just bait. It seemed he had revealed his wealth. Seeing a newly inducted disciple like him purchase so many spirit pills, they wanted to trick him out and kill him, seizing the pills for themselves?

Thinking of this, Lu Yang feigned a look of interest. "I need to consider it."

"No rush for this matter," Immortal Qingchen said, nodding upon hearing his reply. "The inspection procedures are complete. Junior Brother, you can contact me after you've thought it over..."

*Thought it over. Not going.*

Seeing the procedures complete, Lu Yang, without another word, picked up the bottle containing the spirit pills and returned to his cave dwelling, leaving Immortal Qingchen standing alone.

A moment later, Immortal Qingchen, realizing what had happened, nearly ground her teeth. Her pretty face was filled with murderous intent. "This Lu Yang... he dared to trick me!"

Turning to leave, Immortal Qingchen soon arrived at another cave dwelling. Inside the cave dwelling, a young Daoist in luxurious robes had been waiting for a long time. Seeing Immortal Qingchen's unpleasant expression, he immediately frowned in tandem.

"Didn't succeed?"

Immortal Qingchen shook her head. "This person... is a bit too cautious. Moreover, Senior Brother Zhao, this person borrowed money but didn't buy the Yin-Yang Immortal Blossom. Instead, he bought pills. I suspect he never intended to repay the loan at all."

"Wants to default on the debt? In your next life!" Zhao Xuhe heard this and shook his head with a cold laugh. "Do you know that for every newly admitted disciple, the Holy Sect has already secretly assigned them a price? And the amount a disciple can borrow within the Holy Sect will absolutely never exceed their value. This is to ensure that no matter what happens, the Holy Sect can recoup its costs. Bones, flesh, internal organs, souls... these are all valuable commodities, more than enough to repay the debt. He wants to raise his cultivation? Let him raise it then. As long as the person is still alive, higher cultivation actually makes them more valuable."

Zhao Xuhe grinned, a scent of blood seeming to linger between his lips and teeth. "By then, not only will we not suffer a loss, but we might even make a profit. Besides, he has the money to buy these spirit pills, but he might not have the life to use them, right?"

"Senior Brother, you mean..."

Zhao Xuhe nodded slightly, hinting, "Many things are fine as long as they're not discovered."

As soon as these words were uttered, Immortal Qingchen's beautiful eyes immediately lit up.
