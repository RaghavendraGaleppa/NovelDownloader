# Chapter 57: A New Idea

Ding Rui was utterly speechless.
This Senior Brother Shui Yu was a bit unreliable.

Shui Yu also felt a little awkward. His cultivation, at the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, was by no means low, even just a hair's breadth away from the Sea Condensing stage.
Once he reached the Sea Condensing stage, he would become an inner disciple. This cultivation level was clearly already very high.
Ding Rui should have been the one feeling shocked!
An elder brother, about to become an inner disciple, trying to recruit a spirit farmer.
How astonishing was that?

But Ding Rui, with a single thought, had directly set his lower bound at the Sea Condensing stage, pushing his expectations even further to the Golden Core stage.
This made Shui Yu's Foundation Establishment cultivation a bit hard to live up to.

"You really dare to dream. A Golden Core cultivator can become a sect elder. Do you think they'd be here talking to you?" Shui Yu rolled his eyes at Ding Rui.
Ding Rui didn't know what to say for a moment. It was clearly Shui Yu's own failed attempt to show off.

"Senior Brother, then is the Fire Buoyancy Array also responsible for controlling the floating boat's movement and steering now?" Ding Rui couldn't help but ask.

Shui Yu shook his head, "Of course not. The entire floating boat has multiple arrays. The Fire Buoyancy Array is only responsible for making the boat body float. As for controlling steering, forward propulsion, stabilizing the hull, and all other functions, those are completed by other arrays. Only when all the arrays work together can the floating boat truly function."

Ding Rui felt deep admiration, and at the same time, he realized the profound depth and breadth of the path of arrays.
This world of cultivation was gradually unfolding before his eyes in an increasingly real and profound way.

Ding Rui walked around the floating boat. The entire boat was very stable, without the slightest tremor.

After observing for a while, Ding Rui asked again, "Senior Brother, wouldn't this floating boat be very conspicuous when used on a cloudy day?"

Shui Yu nodded, "Indeed, that's one problem with the floating boat. However, at present, this floating boat is only used within our sect's territory, so this issue doesn't have much impact. But the floating boat has another major problem, which is its slow speed. You asked me earlier if the floating boat could only go this fast, and now I'm telling you, yes, it can only go this fast. Therefore, floating boats are generally only used to transport large and heavy resources, or multiple cultivators."

"Don't look at how your pile of spirit rice has already filled the cabin. In reality, this amount is far from the floating boat's limit. It could carry at least three times more resources, as long as they're tied down securely," Shui Yu said proudly. The floating boat was indeed his classic masterpiece.

"We're already here? Wow, I wasn't finished listening yet!"

Ding Rui looked at the open, slightly desolate gate of Spirit Field 520 before him, his face filled with reluctance. After thinking for a moment, he couldn't help but invite Shui Yu, "Senior Brother, you haven't even told me what arrays are all about yet. How about coming to my spirit field for a little while, and we can continue our discussion?"
