# Chapter 47: Clarity of Mind  

Wang Chan sat quietly by the table, the flickering light of the lone lamp casting shifting shadows across his handsome face.  

After a long silence, the lamp suddenly flared with a soft *pop*, its flame swelling in size.  

Wang Chan abruptly grinned. "Heh..."  

The Beauty Mark was Bai Shaofeng's Dao companion, and Bai Shaofeng was the legitimate heir of the Bai family. Getting involved with her would mean offending Bai Shaofeng—a dangerous prospect, as discovery would bring immense trouble.  

Though the Beauty Mark was alluring, Wang Chan had never actively pursued her. As a lone rogue cultivator in the wilds, he sought only steady cultivation and avoided unnecessary trouble.  

Yet, though he remained indifferent, the woman had repeatedly sought him out, which was infuriating.  

The problem was, if the Beauty Mark had been like the dark, burly gatekeeper of Little Tea Mountain or as indiscriminate as Madam Cheng, Wang Chan could have remained unmoved no matter how she flirted.  

But she was different. The mature figure beneath her white soft armor was undeniably tempting—just like the female cultivator in the apricot-yellow Daoist robes, she often visited his dreams.  

As a cultivator, one must face their true self. Wang Chan glanced down—his body was being very honest.  

Even a clay figurine has a temper, let alone him.  

Moreover, whether it was due to his recent cultivation progress or not, he noticed that suppressing his desires and going against his instincts caused his spiritual energy and true force to stagnate, becoming sluggish.  

If this continued, it would severely hinder his cultivation.  

For a cultivator, cultivation was the foundation.  

Compared to the troubles of cultivation, what did other troubles matter?  

True, the Bai family was a foundation-establishment clan, but their legitimate descendants in the Qi Refinement stage numbered at least fifty, if not a hundred. Bai Shaofeng was just one insignificant heir among them.  

So what if he offended him?  

If the matter ever came to light, he could simply strike first!  

Even if Bai Shaofeng were the Bai family's young master or even its patriarch—if the Bai family's women stood in the way of his cultivation, he would crush them all!  

*"If I can't act freely, then what's the point of cultivating immortality?"*  

The thought flashed through Wang Chan's mind.  

At that moment, the spiritual energy in his dantian surged like clouds, and the true force within his bones swelled like tides. An indescribable sense of clarity washed over him, so exhilarating it nearly made him cry out.  

*"This feeling..."*  

Wang Chan was stunned.  

Even when cultivating with spirit liquids and spirit bones, his spiritual energy and true force had never flowed so smoothly.  

If he could maintain this state while cultivating, his efficiency would likely increase by twenty to thirty percent!  

In that instant, Wang Chan understood—  

**Follow your desires, and clarity of mind shall follow!**  

It was like a divine revelation. A refreshing energy spread through his soul, dispelling even the hidden demonic thoughts lurking within.  

*"In that case, why wait for her to finish bathing and come over? Why not sneak over myself and give her a scare—let her experience the terror of a body-refining cultivator!"*  

Wang Chan abruptly stood and strode out into the courtyard.  

Besides, he was curious—why was the Beauty Mark so interested in a rogue cultivator like him?  

Once he subdued her, he would hear her explanation.  

*"Knock, knock."*  

*"Bang!"*  

Suddenly, the courtyard gate sounded again.  

"Who is it?" Wang Chan withdrew his focus from the restrictions of the Water-Fire Escape Technique and turned toward the gate.  

"Giggle—who else but me?" A sultry, teasing voice whispered from outside. "What, did you think another woman would sneak over to find you in the dead of night?"  

Madam Cheng?  

Wang Chan nearly groaned. Of all times, why now? He was busy.  

"Not a good time. Come back another day."  

He didn't hesitate to shoo her away.  

Because right now, his temper was flaring.  

"Oh? Did I interrupt something?" The voice outside became even more teasing, and suddenly louder:  

"But I came about that matter from last time. If you refuse to see me, you might not find me tomorrow. Don't blame me if I break my promise."  

Her outburst was loud enough for the entire neighborhood to hear.  

Wang Chan's rising excitement instantly cooled.  

"You'd better have a damn good reason."  

He yanked the gate open, glaring.  

Madam Cheng covered her mouth with a giggle, then leaned in, peering past him. "So secretive—are you hiding someone's Dao companion in there?"  

Without waiting for a response, she stepped inside and wrapped her arms around his, pulling him close. "Well, you'd better hide them well. Don't let me see~" She laughed. "Now, let's talk inside."  

Wang Chan shoved her off.  

Unfazed, Madam Cheng strolled into the courtyard and headed straight for the house as if she owned the place.  

With no choice, Wang Chan closed the gate and followed.  

He expected her to continue her flirtations inside, and he was ready to retaliate verbally.  

But instead, Madam Cheng's expression turned serious. She took out a low-grade Soundproofing Talisman and a low-grade Concealment Talisman, activating them to envelop the two.  

Then, without a word, she retrieved a pale gray jade token from her storage pouch. On its front was carved a green-faced, fanged ghost, and on the back—the number **69**.  

"Midnight, two nights from now. A thousand li north of the market, in the Darkwood Mountains, at the Spirit Locust Tree. Knock three times." She spoke in a hushed voice. "Don't be late."  

Wang Chan examined the token briefly before tucking it into his sleeve.  

This was undoubtedly the pass for the black market. The number—69—was auspicious. Perhaps this trip would be fruitful.  

Seeing that Madam Cheng had come for legitimate business—and delivered—Wang Chan's irritation faded. He poured her a cup of spirit tea and asked casually, "You're not coming?"  

Last time, she had implied she would join him.  

"At dawn, I'm heading into the mountains with a few friends," she said with a sigh.  

"The mountains?" Wang Chan frowned.  

For rogue cultivators, "the mountains" meant the White Mountain Range.  

It was teeming with demonic beasts, ghosts, and countless perilous zones. Without skill, entering meant never leaving.  

Why would Madam Cheng—comfortable as the manager of the Longing Pavilion—suddenly risk her life in the White Mountain Range?  

Had she hit a bottleneck? Did she need to temper herself through trials?  

But her spiritual energy hadn't even reached seventy strands yet. She shouldn't be facing a mid-stage Qi Refinement bottleneck.  

Wang Chan was puzzled.  

"I was supposed to enter White Mountain City in two years," Madam Cheng said bitterly, staring into her tea. "But the new Nascent Soul True Lord from the Misty Cloud Sect has been making sweeping changes since his arrival..."  

After a long explanation, Wang Chan learned that Madam Cheng had secured entry into White Mountain City through her connections at the Longing Pavilion. However, the newly arrived Nascent Soul True Lord from the Misty Cloud Sect had overhauled the rules.  

Her entry wasn't canceled, but now she had to complete specific missions assigned by the city's Duty Hall within five years—or lose her chance entirely.  

Half an hour later, Madam Cheng stood to leave, handing him a jade slip. "Everything about the black market is in here. Be careful—it's not like the market or the bazaar. Don't draw attention."  

Wang Chan nodded, accepted the slip, and saw her out.  

But as they stepped outside, Madam Cheng clung to his arm again, pouting. "You were quicker than usual tonight..."  

She giggled, glancing around as if speaking to someone else.  

Wang Chan rolled his eyes and ushered her out. As he closed the gate and turned back, he spotted the Beauty Mark perched on the wall, clad in black soft armor, arms crossed, glaring coldly in the direction Madam Cheng had left.  

Her voice was sharp. "The Longing Pavilion's manager sneaks over at midnight—have you two hooked up?"  

Wang Chan didn't explain or defend himself. He simply met her gaze, smirking with amusement.
