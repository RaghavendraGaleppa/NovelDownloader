# Chapter 75: Advancing to the Quarterfinals by Default, Elder Qian Buys a Few Stakes

Lin Jiang understood Jiang Mo's intentions.

He simply couldn't win.

So he might as well forfeit.

It made a strange kind of sense.

Li Mo was speechless, not knowing how to retort. He could only manage a wry, helpless smile.

"You are too kind."

"Thank you, Brother Li, for showing mercy."

Lin Jiang let out a sigh of relief.

Thus, Qunyu Peak won its first match.

It was said that the competition was meant to showcase strength and foster friendship, but in everyone's eyes, this match had nothing but friendship.

Among the inner disciples, whispers spread:

"There's definitely something more to this!"

"I know Lin Jiang. During the sect trial, he dared to fight a ninth-rank late-stage beast."

"This is strange. It's ten parts strange."

In the midst of the whispering disciples of Shenbing Peak, Wang Hao watched the youth walk calmly off the stage, his eyes flashing with cold intent.

Ever since Wang Hu entered Ruyi Peak, he hadn't come out. Because of his kinship with Wang Hu, Wang Hao himself had been taken in for three days of interrogation by the law-enforcing disciples of Ruyi Peak.

It was only then that Wang Hao learned the reason.

Wang Hu had gotten involved with the Demonic Summoning Sect, a group of heretics the Great Yu Dynasty strictly forbade. All sects under heaven were ordered to kill them on sight.

"Senior Brother Wang, it's your turn to fight."

A fellow disciple beside him spoke up to remind him.

Snapping back to his senses, Wang Hao ascended the arena platform.

His opponent was a true disciple at the Inner Qi Jade Liquid Realm.

And the aura he revealed was also at the Inner Qi Jade Liquid Realm, though he was much older than his opponent. His mastery of martial arts was also far deeper.

The two traded blows, the battle reaching a fever pitch.

In the end, Wang Hao emerged victorious.

After defeating his opponent, the imposing aura around Wang Hao did not recede. His gaze was like a knife, scraping across Li Mo's body.

The hostility and the intent to issue a challenge were clear without words.

Seeing Wang Hao's state, Li Mo actually felt a sense of relief.

Finally, he wouldn't have to worry about having no one to fight.

If every opponent on the arena just jumped off and forfeited, this Nine Peaks Tournament would be utterly devoid of experience.

Of course, it was unlikely he would face an opponent who forfeited every single match.

According to the famous Murphy's Law, the thing you least want to happen is the thing most likely to happen.

The next match.

On the arena, two old acquaintances stood facing each other, speechless.

"Brother Li."

Murong Xiao looked at him, a shy smile on his face.

Li Mo: "......."

He cast a highly suspicious glance at Elder Qian, who was in charge of the draw.

Elder Qian took a light breath, his face also a mask of confusion. How had he managed to draw another one of this小子's acquaintances?

Murong Xiao was also a highly regarded disciple of the Qingyuan Sect.

Although only at the Blood Qi Realm, relying on his half-demon body and exquisite body refinement, he had already defeated several opponents with higher cultivation levels. His performance was even stronger than Lin Jiang's.

With a bit of luck, he had a chance of entering the top sixteen.

Up on the high platform.

"Murong Xiao, the prodigy of the Ziyang Mansion."

"For this battle, he should finally show his full strength, right?"

The young man in white robes looked at Murong Xiao with a mix of admiration and a strong fighting spirit.

He was the chief disciple of the Fen Yulin faction, the one in whom they placed great hopes for this generation!

He, too, possessed a half-demon body.

The title of "Prodigy of the Ziyang Mansion" should belong to him!

Over at the Chijiang Gang, the Blood-Robed Young Master said nothing, but his eyes were already narrowed.

He couldn't see through that youth.

Just like he couldn't see through Ying Bing.

"Han He, what do you think?" Qian Bufan asked, and everyone turned their gaze to the elder of Shenbing Peak.

It was well known that Elder Han He had a stern and rigid temperament; he certainly wouldn't engage in any underhanded dealings.

So this match was definitely fair.

Unexpectedly, Han He simply shook his head.

"Murong Xiao is not Li Mo's match."

He admitted it quite frankly.

This left the other elders at a loss.

As his master, he must have a good understanding of Murong Xiao's strength. How could he be so certain Murong Xiao would lose without even thinking about it?

If that was the case, there could only be one possibility.

---

The true disciple Li truly possessed the strength to earn Elder Han He's recognition.

"It seems my grand-disciple might really be able to give us a surprise," Xue Jing said with a smile, his gaze shifting toward the arena.

However, Qian Bufan's voice rang out:

"Murong Xiao forfeits."

"Li Mo, victory!"

This time, the elders said nothing, their expressions thoughtful.

The other disciples watching, as well as those from other sects, were completely unable to understand.

A wave of uproar spread:

"Huh? Murong Xiao forfeited too?"

"Look at how he keeps calling him 'Brother Li.' It seems he has a very good relationship with True Disciple Li and is letting him win?"

"Aren't the elders going to do anything about this?"

"It's said that True Disciple Li is well-connected. I'm seeing it for myself today. Can you really advance to the top thirty-two through connections?"

"If there was a scheme, Elder Qian would definitely know. I suspect he bought a few stakes."

...

Amidst the discussions and doubts, Li Mo took a deep breath. "Brother Murong, you..."

"Brother Li, I can see you've had another breakthrough. I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to hold back."

Murong Xiao shivered involuntarily.

He couldn't help but recall the scene of Li Mo making his move in the training hall. At the time, he had even suspected an earthquake was happening.

"I... I still want to try for the top sixteen..." Murong Xiao said, feeling wronged.

That huge chunk of Whale's Breath Coral Stone had been discolored by a single blow. Brother Li hadn't even used any martial arts. With one punch, the power was already at the level of an Inner Qi Jade Liquid Realm attack. The mere trace of weapon-killing intent that leaked out was enough to make his scalp tingle.

Now that he had a breakthrough, what would happen?

Li Mo didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Without fighting a single match, he was already in the top thirty-two.

It couldn't really be called relying on connections.

Where could he even reason with this?

......

The morning matches ended with Elder Qian's announcement of a midday break.

Two more rounds of battles were held later.

From the top thirty-two all the way to the top eight.

Those who fought their way out all had their own unique strengths and displayed their various divine abilities. This could be said to be the most competitive Nine Peaks Tournament in history.

Among them were those like Wang Hao, who was just at the age limit, with a deep accumulation of experience and rich combat skills. There were also rising stars like Murong Xiao, with their extraordinary talent.

Of course, one had to mention Ying Bing.

Every time she stepped onto the stage, she crushed her opponents with absolute superiority, advancing with overwhelming force. Every battle ended in an instant.

Of course... she wasn't the only one who was fast. For instance, that true disciple of Qunyu Peak who was "advanced by connections" and hadn't made a move yet...

In short, the afternoon tournament was packed with看点.

......

Qingyuan Main Peak, cafeteria.

Li Mo, Murong Xiao, Xiao Qin, and Lin Jiang were sitting at a table eating.

Watching the other three bury their heads and shovel food into their mouths, Li Mo felt a bit melancholic.

"Now the whole sect is saying I advanced through connections."

"Some are even saying I threw the matches."

"Do any of you have any ideas?"

He had competed all morning without fighting a single match. He had energy with nowhere to vent, which was inexplicably frustrating.

"Brother Li, if I had fought you, I probably wouldn't have been able to advance," Murong Xiao said sheepishly.

Lin Jiang nodded in agreement, a look of having survived a calamity on his face.

"Brother Li, the Hundred Flower Condensate Ointment probably can't bring the dead back to life..."

The corner of Li Mo's mouth twitched. He looked at the other person.

"Old Xiao, what about you? You're at the Inner Qi Realm. Surely you could have at least gone through the motions with me?"

"Huh?"

Xiao Qin now had a black eye, a piece of paper stuffed in his nose to stop the bleeding, and a look of confusion on his face. He pointed at himself with his bandaged hand.

"Me?"

Old Xiao had been unlucky.

He had run into another true disciple at the Inner Qi Jade Liquid Realm and had a real one-on-one fight. Both sides had ended up injured.

He had narrowly won a hard-fought victory, but his right hand was now temporarily unusable due to the injury.

And then...

In the very next round, he was paired with Li Mo.
