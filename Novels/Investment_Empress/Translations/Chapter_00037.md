# Chapter 37: An Unexpected Turn in Ying Bing's Life

Behind the stone door was a karst cave.

Trees, rocks, and insects had all crystallized, shimmering like red jewels.

It was magnificent, yet utterly silent.

No one had set foot here for a very long time, and everything within the cave seemed to be eternally frozen in a specific moment, encased in red crystal.

The rosy light grew denser, now coalesced into a tangible essence. At its source stood a vivid and mystical small tree.

Not far away, a bathtub-sized pool held a pool of rose-red liquid, emitting an exotic fragrance that caused one's pores to open wide.

This was the entirety of the Nine-Colored Primal Phoenix's inheritance.

Everything was exactly as it had been when Ying Bing came in her previous life.

She let out a long breath.

The Nine-Colored Primal Phoenix was extremely important to her.

One could say that without the Nine Spirits of the Nine-Colored Primal Phoenix, the Blood Phoenix Scripture she relied upon would be like rootless duckweed, not even comparable to a profound technique. Her rebirth itself was due to her using a conjectured forbidden art from the Blood Phoenix Scripture at the very last moment: 'Nirvana.'

Now, she would obtain the Dawn Spirit even earlier! And she wouldn't need to grope around for understanding; she knew all its profound mysteries! This life, she would fly higher, faster, and farther...

Ying Bing calmed her turbulent mind and said softly, "That pool of water is infused with a trace of auspicious beast essence blood. You can soak in it; its future benefits for you are immeasurable. At the very least, your body-refining cultivation will advance a step further."

A trace of Nine-Colored Primal Phoenix essence blood. In her previous life, it was precisely by soaking in this pool that she completed her meridian opening. Furthermore, from then on, she became immune to all poisons, and felt as if aided by gods in the Qi-Blood Realm.

Now, however, she no longer needed it.

"Thanks then," Li Mo said with a smile, in good spirits. "You should also hurry and accept your inheritance."

Though the Ice-block hadn't explicitly said it, he knew in his heart that this so-called auspicious beast essence blood was most likely the Nine-Colored Primal Phoenix's essence blood. Even without investment feedback, this trip could be considered extremely fruitful. Very few rewards from the system could compare to this pool of spring water.

The Ice-block might appear to keep people at arm's length, but deep down, she still cared for him...

He wasn't one to be prim or proper. He directly stepped into the pool water.

Instantly, an incredibly potent vitality surged into every pore on his body, like countless small fish swimming through the major meridians around him. The comfort was so profound it felt as if his soul was being cleansed.

"With this, I have repaid this favor."

Ying Bing had expected to feel a weight lifted off her mind after repaying the favor. But for some reason, she now felt a hint of emptiness?

Nevertheless, Li Mo had already greatly altered his destiny to reach this point. In the future, he might even carve out a place for himself in the Eastern Desolate Region...

Suppressing her thoughts, Ying Bing lowered her gaze to the small tree. The tree was barely taller than a person, yet it subtly exuded a grand and majestic aura. Its branches were bare, making it impossible to tell if it was alive or dead.

Ying Bing bit her fingertip.

*Plop*

A drop of blood fell onto the soil, flowing into the tree's root system. A miraculous scene unfolded.

With the first drop, the withered trunk began to radiate vitality.
With the second drop, new sprouts appeared on the trunk.
With the third, the sprouts transformed into branches and began to grow rapidly.
With the fourth, the branches blossomed with leaves, and a tiny bud emerged at the crown of the tree.

...

Until the ninth drop of blood fell.

The bud finally unfurled completely. A clear, ringing cry, like jade shattering, echoed.

"The Dawn Spirit."

Ying Bing's gaze fell upon the fully bloomed bud, where a palm-sized miniature phoenix stood. The phoenix was lifelike and remarkably spirited. If one didn't know its secret, they might mistake it for a living creature.

She reached out, intending for it to hop onto her palm.

However...

The phoenix suddenly flapped its wings and swiftly flew away.

Ying Bing: "?!"

A sudden anomaly. Her heart gave a violent lurch, and she quickly turned, her gaze following the phoenix.

This was...

Li Mo?!

The phoenix landed on the young man's shoulder, hopping around and seeming exceptionally affectionate.

The Nine-Colored Primal Phoenix's Dawn Spirit, which she had nourished with her own blood, had actually chosen Li Mo?

Ying Bing found the scene before her unbelievable, even suspecting it was a hallucination. Her Taiyin Moon Phoenix Physique could successfully awaken the Dawn Spirit. This proved that her physique had an intimate connection with the Nine-Colored Primal Phoenix. She was also logically the chosen successor. This was something she had been absolutely certain of in both her past and present lives!

But Li Mo... why?

The phoenix, manifesting from the Dawn Spirit, had abandoned her and chosen him? Was it because that brocade pouch contained the aura of a true phoenix?

"Huh? Where did this bird come from?" Li Mo was still soaking in the hot spring. He opened his eyes and saw a beautiful little bird hopping on his chest. He wanted to ask Ying Bing what was going on, and if there was any danger, but then he noticed her expression, which was incredibly complex.

Li Mo's mind gave a sudden jolt. This was the first time he had seen the Ice-block wear such an expression.

"Is this... your inheritance?" Li Mo asked.

Ying Bing nodded faintly, "Yes."

Li Mo: "......"

The karst cave suddenly fell silent, only their breathing could be heard. The atmosphere became exceedingly awkward.

"This... Ice-block, you're not thinking of... killing for treasure, are you?" Li Mo stood up from the pool and asked tentatively, "We're like siblings... childhood sweethearts..."

Ying Bing's feelings were originally inexpressible, but the young man's nervous expression inexplicably made her find it amusing. She raised her delicate eyebrows. "Why not?"

At her words, Li Mo instead relaxed. "Don't try to fool me. You're not like that."

Ying Bing looked at him, not speaking.

Yes. If this young man didn't trust her completely, he wouldn't have followed her down here.

Li Mo suddenly asked, "This is very important to you, isn't it?"

"Yes." Ying Bing nodded, lost in thought. The Nine Spirits of the Nine-Colored Primal Phoenix had helped her overcome many difficulties. More than just a stroke of fortune, they had become a crucial, inseparable part of her destiny and life. Among them, the Dawn Spirit had accompanied her the longest. And now, a part of her life had chosen someone else. The Phoenix Empress's feelings were incredibly complex.

"Then this must be something very powerful," Li Mo remarked, examining the hopping little bird in his palm. The little thing was quite beautiful.

Ying Bing's eyebrows were furrowed for a long time before finally smoothing out. "But since it chose you, it belongs to you."

"Hm?" Li Mo blinked, asking, "You put so much effort into it; aren't you unwilling?"

"I am, but it has chosen you." Ying Bing regained her composure. "Besides... without it, I am still me."

So domineering. Young Li admitted he was impressed, just a little bit. He had just managed to think of teasing the Ice-block, only to find himself completely outshone. No wonder she was the chosen one.

He chuckled silently.

Li Mo gently fended off the little phoenix, which was trying to get closer and rub against him. The little phoenix seemed to feel wronged, displaying a hint of human-like puzzlement.

"Go on, go where you should go," Li Mo said softly. "Follow her, and you'll still see me often." With a gentle toss, the little phoenix seemed to understand his meaning, flapping its wings and flying back to Ying Bing.

Ying Bing looked up. Her jade-like face finally lost its usual composure. She gazed at the young man, her eyes filled with surprise, and even a hint of bewilderment.

Ying Bing spoke as if seeing him for the first time. "It is a creation that can change your destiny, giving you a chance to stand at the peak of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. If you regret it now, it's not too late."

"I know," Li Mo replied, his smile genuine. The more precious it was, the better his investment return would be. A precious inheritance capable of changing Ying Bing's destiny—what would the System return him for it? *Tsk tsk*...

"But it's rare to see you have something you truly care about."

"......"

Ying Bing's clear, deep eyes, filled with an unreadable emotion, shifted several times before finally softening faintly.

"Okay."

The little phoenix flew into her glabella, transforming into a rose-red mark on her forehead. Ten thousand auspicious rays suddenly burst forth. The dawn light surged out of the cave mouth, blooming with unspeakable splendor.

Outside, dusk was falling, but Clear Abyss suddenly lit up, like a river of stars formed by the brilliant dawn light. Clear phoenix cries echoed incessantly, reverberating across the sky.

Clear Abyss Sect, Purple Yang Manor, and even the entire Eastern Desolate could hear them clearly.

On the peak of Moon-Gazing Cliff, the elders stared dumbfounded at the unfolding scene, shock evident on their faces.

"Clear Abyss has changed."

"Quickly inform the Sect Master!"
