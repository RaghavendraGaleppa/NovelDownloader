# Chapter 29: Wind Blade Technique

After drawing well water with a wooden bucket and giving himself a thorough rinse in the courtyard, Lin Shan returned to his room feeling refreshed. He sat cross-legged once more and began his meditation.

Now that he had developed spiritual sense, he instantly re-entered the state he'd achieved during his previous session.

Countless green specks of light danced before him like mischievous sprites. Every time he tried to grasp them with his ethereal hands, they would dart away at the last moment. Their vibrant movements and faint glow seemed to embody the very essence of heaven and earth—the primordial qi of the universe.

"So this is spiritual energy?"

A grin spread across Lin Shan's face as excitement surged through him. He wanted nothing more than to claim all of it for himself.

Yet no matter how he tried to capture them, these motes of energy seemed to possess an innate intelligence, yearning for freedom and resisting constraint. They always managed to evade his grasp by the narrowest margins, as elusive and untouchable as the wind itself. His frustration mounted with each failed attempt.

"Am I doing this wrong?"

On the verge of stepping onto the immortal path, yet unable to absorb even a single wisp of spiritual energy, Lin Shan felt his patience wearing thin.

Forcing himself to calm the turbulent thoughts, he suddenly remembered the "Xun Wind Art" and immediately began circulating the technique. This time, the green specks of light ceased their playful antics and slowly allowed themselves to be drawn into his body.

His physical form now resembled a massive gravitational force. As he activated the technique, it was like pumping a bellows—each cycle forcefully capturing and absorbing the surrounding wind-attributed spiritual energy, devouring these tiny particles one after another.

Once enough energy had been gathered, he circulated it through several major cycles, gradually refining it into spiritual power that settled into his dantian.

This step marked his official entry into the Qi Refining stage.

He had become a genuine cultivator!

This tangible growth in strength allowed him to physically feel his own progress.

Comparing this to his decade of martial arts training—the daily, meticulous circulation of blood and qi, the endless tempering of his meridians—Lin Shan realized how aimless that path had been. There had been no way to know how much longer he needed to temper himself before making further progress.

Cultivation, however, involved plundering the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. Every bit seized translated directly to growth—a method so addictive it was impossible to resist.

"Now I understand why the texts say 'A day in the mountains, a millennium in the mortal world.'

If I didn't need food or drink, and faced no bottlenecks, I'd cultivate until the seas ran dry and mountains crumbled, emerging only when I'd achieved immortality."

Musing to himself as he cultivated, Lin Shan continued until the second watch of the night without realizing it. Yet he remained full of energy and vitality.

After consolidating his first-level Qi Refining foundation, he temporarily ceased his cultivation and opened the Xun Wind Art manual. He recalled that it contained instructions for three common wind-attribute spells.

The other two manuals, "Evergreen Wood Art" and "Profound Earth Technique," naturally included basic wood and earth-element spells as well. But at the time, he'd been focused on sensing qi and breaking through to the Qi Refining stage, so he hadn't paid them any attention.

Now that he'd become a cultivator, he couldn't wait to try his hand at spellcasting!

Flipping to the final pages, he found descriptions of the three spells: the "Wind Blade Technique" for early Qi Refining, the "Wind Riding Technique" for mid-stage, and the "Wind Binding Technique" for late-stage.

The requirements for cultivation were simple—it all came down to whether one had sufficient spiritual power. Only by advancing in realm and increasing the spiritual energy stored in one's dantian could more complex spells be cast.

At the first level of Qi Refining, Lin Shan was firmly in the early stage, with only a thin layer of spiritual power in his dantian. He estimated he could barely manage a few Wind Blade casts before exhausting it.

Nevertheless, he eagerly studied the technique. After about half an hour, feeling he'd grasped the essentials, he pushed open his door and stepped into the courtyard.

Following the manual's instructions, he slowly channeled his spiritual power, raising his right hand with index and ring fingers extended before his chest.

After roughly three breaths, a palm-sized crescent blade took form, hovering beautifully above his fingers.

Lin Shan stared excitedly at the green wind blade before him. After examining it for a moment, he pointed toward the large banyan tree in the yard.

"Go!"

The green crescent shot forth like an arrow from its bow, transforming into a streak of light.

"Bang!"

"Rustle—"

A dull impact sounded, followed by the tree shaking violently. Leaves rained down throughout the courtyard.

With his enhanced vision, Lin Shan clearly saw the wind blade pierce clean through the banyan tree, then continue through the courtyard wall before dissipating three meters beyond.

"My current attack range is about ten meters," Lin Shan mused, stroking his chin.

The Wind Blade Technique's sharpness rivaled that of legendary mortal weapons, and its speed exceeded what ordinary eyes could follow.

But as the most basic of spells, it was merely a technique for utilizing wind-attributed spiritual energy—strictly speaking, the equivalent of a cultivator's basic attack rather than a true skill. No wonder it was tacked on at the end of the manual as a bonus.

Having gauged the wind blade's power and range, Lin Shan assessed his remaining spiritual power—enough for perhaps two more casts. He felt no disappointment, however.

After all, he'd only been cultivating for half a day and had just entered the first level of Qi Refining. The road ahead was long!

Sitting on the ground, he flipped through the Xun Wind Art to examine the other two spells.

The "Wind Riding Technique" required mid-stage Qi Refining cultivation to perform. It allowed the user to ride the wind, traversing mountains and valleys with greatly increased speed—ideal for travel or escape.

Could it enable flight? 

Unfortunately not. As a freebie, one couldn't expect too much.

The other technique, the "Wind Binding Technique" for late-stage Qi Refining, was far more practical—a control skill that could restrain opponents from a distance. However, its spiritual energy consumption increased exponentially, making it untenable for early and mid-stage cultivators.

Lin Shan read with great interest, treating it as advanced preparation. Since cultivation itself was so addictive, he'd focus on that for now. As for spells, the Wind Blade Technique would suffice for the time being.

...

Enjoying the night breeze in the courtyard, Lin Shan decided he'd had enough and turned to return indoors. But just then, his sharpened senses—a natural ability of Qi Refining cultivators—caught faint whispers outside his wall. Within a ten-meter radius, no movement escaped his notice.

The clandestine conversation reached his ears with perfect clarity.

"Brother Zhao, what's this kid's background anyway? Why would the family head send a top-tier expert like you to investigate?"

"Some questions shouldn't be asked! As an outer-circle retainer of the Zhao family, certain secrets aren't for your ears."

"Now that's unfair! Though I don't bear the Zhao name, I've risked life and limb for the family all these years. I consider myself one of you!"

"Fine, I'll give you the gist—but keep it to yourself."

"My lips are sealed."

"Today, that kid used Nightingale Vice-Leader Jiang's token to buy the Golden Bell from the family head. Through our clansmen in the Nightingale, we learned he wasn't Jiang's envoy at all—just borrowed the token for transactions and used it to bluff his way through."

"The little bastard's got gall! Daring to trick the family head?"

"Humph. The brat's not just bold—he's carrying over a thousand taels in silver notes! The money's mine, but I'll throw you a bone."

"Of course, of course. You're the top-tier expert here—I'm just along for the ride..."

...

The two outside the wall never imagined that within the courtyard sat a cultivator who'd heard every word.

"Old Zhao reacted this quickly?" Lin Shan felt a surge of relief that he'd broken through to Qi Refining in time. Had he delayed even slightly, a top-tier martial artist would have come knocking—and tonight would have been his last.

"Pfft pfft."

Fine dust trickled down as four hands gripped the wall's edge—the pair preparing to climb over.

Inside the courtyard, Lin Shan raised both hands before his chest, fingers extended. Two crescents slowly took shape.

Two dark figures flipped over the wall, dusting themselves off as they landed. Before they could react, their pupils reflected two speeding crescents.

An ambush?

"Pfft! Pfft!"

They instinctively ducked. Two sounds came from behind—the mysterious projectiles had pierced clean through the wall.

"Whew..."

Both sighed in relief, thankful their assailant had missed.

Then they collapsed as their legs separated from their bodies—the blades had sliced clean through before continuing through the wall.

"AHH!"

"AAAHH!"

Twin screams pierced the night. Throughout the neighborhood, residents buried their heads under blankets in perfect synchrony.
