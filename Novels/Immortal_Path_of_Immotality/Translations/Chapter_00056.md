# Chapter 56: Mid-Grade Magical Artifact  

The crowd examined the Water-Avoiding Pearl, then glanced at the black-robed Daoist nun, silently relieved they hadn't purchased her Water Arrow Talisman.  

The black-robed Daoist nun remained expressionless.  

In the past, the Water-Avoiding Pearl might have been a counter to her abilities. But now, she was no longer limited to just the Water Arrow Technique.  

The woman in the bamboo hat spoke in a clear voice, "This Water-Avoiding Pearl is a magical artifact with unique effects in critical moments. The asking price is 30 spirit stones."  

No one responded. As rogue cultivators, they'd rather spend 20 spirit stones on a mass-produced magical sword—those were far more versatile!  

Where would they even use a Water-Avoiding Pearl now? Buy it just to collect dust?  

Seeing no interest, the woman in the bamboo hat silently put it away and sat down.  

Now it was Lin Shan's turn. Without wasting words, he placed the Warm Sun Jade Pendant on the table. "Solar Warm Jade. Feel free to bid."  

To his surprise, someone was actually interested.  

The hook-nosed man inspected it and nodded approvingly.  

"Not bad! It's genuine Solar Warm Jade. I've been refining my crafting skills lately and could use this with some other materials to attempt forging a fire-attribute defensive artifact."  

He made an offer: "Two spirit stones. How about it?"  

*Pfft!*  

Lin Shan spat out his tea.  

Both were first-grade spiritual materials—the Innate Vermilion Fruit sold for 30 spirit stones, yet his Solar Warm Jade was only worth two?  

The hook-nosed man, startled by Lin Shan's exaggerated reaction, patiently explained, "A low-grade magical artifact starts at 20 spirit stones. After accounting for the craftsman's labor, forging costs, and auxiliary materials, Solar Warm Jade isn't particularly rare in volcanic regions. This price is actually quite fair!"  

Lin Shan skeptically glanced at Daoist Huang, who nodded helplessly, confirming the man's words.  

Frustrated, Lin Shan thought, *Two spirit stones? What's the point of selling it?* He might as well keep it—perhaps he'd encounter Thunderclap Master in the cultivation world someday and use it to build rapport.  

Looking back now, Thunderclap Master's lightning technique was at least a high-grade spell, and his cultivation level was likely beyond Foundation Establishment.  

Lin Shan shook his head and said he'd reconsider, privately lamenting the exorbitant profits of artifact crafting. The hook-nosed man sighed regretfully but said Lin Shan could contact him if he changed his mind.  

With that, the exchange concluded. After some casual conversation, they agreed to set off together in ten days and dispersed.  

---  

On the way back, Lin Shan subtly hinted to Daoist Huang that the green-skinned gourd might be problematic.  

Why not say it outright? First, he couldn't explain how he knew. Second, he had no proof the gourd was dangerous.  

Even more absurdly, though he knew something was wrong, he couldn't do anything about it.  

He couldn't just tell Daoist Huang to throw the gourd away—what about the spirit insects inside?  

Daoist Huang absentmindedly toyed with the green gourd hanging from his neck, merely acknowledging Lin Shan's warning. Whether he took it seriously was anyone's guess.  

---  

Back at the Nightingale headquarters, Lin Shan felt a growing urgency.  

The cultivators he'd met today weren't what he'd expected.  

He had assumed they'd be like Daoist Huang—mediocre rogue cultivators content with idling in the mortal world, at best on par with Daoist Nan or the Guangnan Wanderer.  

But after meeting them, he realized that despite returning to secular life, they hadn't given up on improving themselves, still hoping to establish a foothold in the cultivation world someday.  

The items they'd brought for exchange made it clear they had even greater trump cards up their sleeves.  

The black-robed Daoist nun aside, the hook-nosed man could casually dismantle low-grade artifacts, implying he had many more.  

As for the green-robed elder, he surely had far more than the fifty or sixty Mistlight Moths he'd traded—likely hundreds, or he wouldn't have parted with them so easily.  

Moreover, his covert actions suggested he might target Daoist Huang on the way to Yichuan.  

Thus, Lin Shan needed to rapidly strengthen himself to ensure he could protect himself during the journey.  

Back in his room, Lin Shan took out the Ironsteel Sword he'd acquired for ten spirit stones.  

**[Ironsteel Sword]** (Moderately Damaged)  
Grade: Low-Grade Magical Artifact  
Description: Forged from hundred-thousand-fold refined iron, imbued with low-grade sharpness and low-grade durability (half of the internal inscriptions are damaged).  
Enhancement Cost: 8 points  

...  

Lin Shan only had eight points of Ancient Charm left—just enough for one enhancement.  

But aside from this sword, he had no other options. His cultivation time had been too short, leaving him severely lacking in resources.  

As for Ancient Charm—what use was it if he died?  

"Enhance!"  

In an instant, a white light flooded the room. The Ironsteel Sword floated in midair as blue beams erupted from its surface, filling the space with a bone-chilling cold.  

Lin Shan watched in awe as countless glowing specks spread across the blade, dyeing the white steel blue like ink soaking into paper.  

The sword's grooves and inscriptions twisted and turned as crystalline liquid flowed through them. White mist curled from the blade, and frost crackled across the ceiling.  

The enhancement panel transformed instantly.  

**[Frostiron Sword]**  
Grade: Mid-Grade Magical Artifact  
Description: Forged from second-grade spiritual material Frostiron, inscribed with intermediate sharpness, durability, and freezing effects.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

...  

A flash of blue light illuminated the room before darkness returned.  

*Clang!*  

A clear sword hum reverberated through the area. All Nightingale assassins in the Marquis of Bowang's estate paused, glancing around in confusion. The Grand Elder even stepped outside, searching for the source of the sound.  

A three-foot-long magical sword lay quietly across Lin Shan's lap.  

The blade was entirely blue, adorned with three intricate inscriptions resembling mountain springs and subterranean rivers—twisting, winding, slender yet profound.  

Gripping the hilt, Lin Shan channeled his spiritual energy into the Frostiron Sword.  

Three blue dots appeared at the base of the hilt, tracing the grooves along the blade. When the energy fully activated the inscriptions, the sword erupted in a dazzling blue radiance!  

The room filled with shimmering blue reflections as icy mist swirled upward.  

Lin Shan felt the sword brimming with power. Compelled by instinct, he swung it forward.  

A three-foot-long azure sword beam shot forth faster than the eye could follow.  

*Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!*  

A series of shattering sounds followed.  

Lin Shan looked up, stunned.  

The side of his room had collapsed. The wall ahead was obliterated, along with the courtyard wall beyond it, the house behind that, and the next wall—clearing a path over twenty meters long!  

Every destroyed structure was rimed with frost, ice crystals glittering in the aftermath.  

The Frostiron's innate properties, combined with the freezing inscriptions, had produced a devastating dual effect.  

*Now this is a real magical sword!*  

Lin Shan caressed the mid-grade artifact with fervor. The blade, freshly honed, still pulsed with residual energy, its blue glow flickering intermittently—exuding an aura of mystery and latent power.  

Most Qi Refinement cultivators could only cast spells within a ten-meter range. But the Frostiron Sword's sword beam doubled that distance!  

*Power...*  

Lin Shan clenched his fist tightly. For the first time since leaving the Lin family two years ago, he truly felt strength in his grasp.  

He had always been cautious, feeling like something was missing wherever he went.  

Now, he finally had the power to protect himself!  

Compared to Daoist Nan—the only mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator he'd seen in action at Dongting Lake—Lin Shan was confident that if they fought again, he wouldn't need to hide in a corner.  

He could face him head-on and cut him down with a single strike!  

As for martial artists? Even if hundreds or thousands came at him, one sword beam would suffice. If one wasn't enough, two would do. No tricks, no fuss—just pure, overwhelming force.  

*This is what it means to be a true cultivator!*
