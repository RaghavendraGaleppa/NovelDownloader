# Chapter 567: The Battle Begins

His features were handsome and valiant, with a touch of vermilion cinnabar at the center of his forehead. His pupils burned like fire, ignited with pure, unadulterated fury and the intent to kill.

He wore战甲 of crimson gold lotus leaves, his hair bound with red silk. A scarlet Chaos Red Ribbon, like a burning blood-colored cloud, wrapped around his arm, fluttering without wind and snapping loudly.

A simple golden ring was slung over his shoulder and back, its treasures' light subtly flowing.

Most striking were the two golden fire wheels beneath his feet, burning with crimson flames.

As the firelight rose, the very space seemed to twist under their intense heat.

In his hand, he firmly gripped an eighteen-foot-long Fire-Tipped Spear, its entire body a dark gold, its tip condensed with a glint of cold light that seemed capable of piercing the heavens.

The spear tip was pointed directly at Xu Yunfan.

A chilling killing intent!
A war spirit that rushed to the heavens!

This vivid image, this overbearing and peerless aura, instantly pierced through Xu Yunfan's distant memories.

His pupils contracted sharply.

"Fire Wind Wheels, Fire-Tipped Spear, Chaos Red Ribbon, Universe Ring..."

"This is..."

The half-grown boy before him, though his spirit and temperament perfectly harmonized with the heavenly dao of this world, those iconic treasures and attire instantly brought a name from ancient mythology to the very tip of his tongue.

"Nezha?"

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, carefully sensing the boy's power, and only then did he relax.

Fortunately, based on the level of power, the opponent was only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment.

The boy suddenly thrust his Fire-Tipped Spear forward, his voice like a thunderclap rolling across the clouds.

"Hey! Foreign demon, how dare you invade my Heavenly Realm! With this young master here, you shall meet your doom!"

As the vanguard commander, Xu Yunfan's body flickered with faint lightning. Though he faced the young god-general who resembled Nezha, not a shred of fear arose in his heart.

Retreat?
Absolutely impossible. If he were to retreat, he would likely be sidelined upon his return.

The face of the True Lord of Qingyuan's lineage now rested on his shoulders. In a place like the Primordial Origin Sect, losing a major figure's face and status would mean more than just a simple loss. His future days would likely be fraught with difficulty.

As a Foundation Establishment true person of the demonic path, where could he flee if he abandoned the sect?

The fierce young god-general before him was merely at the early stage of Foundation Establishment. No matter how many treasures he possessed or how imposing his aura, how could he possibly shake Xu Yunfan?

"Hmph!"

A barely audible snort escaped Xu Yunfan's nose, like a muffled thunder rolling through his chest.

He didn't even glance at the torrent of Qi Condensation disciples surging behind him, who had yet to stabilize their formations. He abruptly raised his arm, and a condensed bolt of lightning erupted from his fingertip, its light illuminating the heavens and drawing all eyes.

"Kill."

The single word, imbued with the spiritual pressure of a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator, instantly overshadowed the killing intent over the sea of clouds.

The tone was cold, carrying an undeniable command.

The Qi Condensation disciples behind him were not mere cannon fodder, but elite talents.

The hundred thousand celestial soldiers and generals in the sky were intimidating, but they couldn't frighten these demonic path disciples.

*Hum!*

On the platform, the nearly ten thousand Primordial Origin Qi Condensation disciples, after a moment of daze and trembling, were immediately ignited by naked greed and blind devotion to the sect's contribution points.

Whether their hearts were filled with excitement, fear, confusion, or ferocity, the moment the word "kill" reached their ears, the cruel instinct rooted in plunder and the law of the jungle within the Primordial Origin Sect instantly suppressed all other emotions.

They were like ferocious beasts breaking their final shackles, letting out meaningless roars or wild howls as they transformed into a boiling, dark tide.

All kinds of magical treasures, spiritual lights, poisonous smoke, and sinister winds, chaotic yet carrying the unique ferocity of a demonic sect, charged recklessly and desperately towards the orderly battle formation of the celestial soldiers on the sea of clouds.

"Kill! Seize cultivation methods, snatch immortal treasures! Behead for merit, the sect rewards!"

Someone screamed hoarsely amidst the chaos, completely igniting the faint glimmer of hope in the hearts of these disciples, who were essentially delinquents.

The mountainous debt on their backs had squeezed out the last of their bloody courage. They were betting everything, hoping that a humble bicycle might transform into a motorcycle.

Perhaps they could even become Foundation Establishment true persons upon their return.

At the same moment, the seven figures of Foundation Establishment true persons behind Xu Yunfan did not hesitate.

Though they each harbored their own schemes, held different opinions about their new commander, and might have been plotting to withdraw at a critical moment or snatch the credit...

At this moment, the celestial army was before them, and the heavenly god-general was watching like a tiger. This was also tied to the sect's grand plan of invading the Heavenly Realm.

If they preserved their strength and caused the vanguard to fail, angering the Golden Core true lord stationed in the rear, the consequences...

The thought of having their souls extracted and refined, and their bodies and spirits utterly destroyed, sent a chill down the spines of all seven true persons.

One true person, who cultivated an orthodox demonic path technique, sneered.

"Merely celestial soldiers, yet you dare block the path of our Sacred Sect."

"Behead them, build merit and establish a career!"

"Fellow sect members, cease holding back! Quickly form formations to meet the enemy!"

With a few shouts, seven immense Foundation Establishment auras erupted. Though not as boundless and vast as the perfected great true persons like Lu Chuan and Tian Yan, they were still like seven rising pillars of smoke, carrying a chilling pressure as they locked onto the figures of several celestial generals behind the army. These generals emitted the same Foundation Establishment aura and held command flags or jade tablets.

They knew well that those celestial generals were the key nodes capable of organizing the celestial soldiers for effective resistance.

The seven figures, like meteors chasing the moon, carried rolling demonic qi,妖风, and清气 as they instantly bypassed the chaotic Qi Condensation battlefield, charging directly at the several powerful Foundation Establishment auras, intending to firmly pin them down.

The Foundation Establishment level battlefield was instantly pulled far away, clashing轰然 in the air with thunder and lightning, strange and dazzling lights. The狂澜 of spiritual energy ran rampant, churning the sea of clouds below into a frenzy.

The Qi Condensation battlefield, however, had already erupted into a bloody melee!

Chaos, blood, and lack of order clashed against the solemn, disciplined, and iron-willed celestial soldiers.

On one side were the desperate charges of the Primordial Origin Qi Condensation disciples. Each was like a gambler bearing a blood feud, activating demonic techniques. Blood-stained talismans flew everywhere, vengeful spirits and fierce ghosts howled, and poisonous miasma and green smoke弥漫. There were even those who, fearing no death, directly detonated their magical treasures, all to tear an opening in the dense ranks of the celestial soldiers.

Screams, curses, the clang of treasures colliding, and the explosions of spiritual power merged into an ocean of demonic sounds.

On the other side, although the celestial army's formation was shaken by the sudden, frenzied charge and局部 fell into chaos, their overall will remained firm.

Command flags fluttered within the formation, and layer upon layer of silver armor shone with immortal light, forming a dense forest of spears and halberds.

Tens of thousands of celestial soldiers roared in unison, their voices transforming into a torrent of metal, the rolling killing intent of war凝聚 like a tangible mountain, crushing down upon the charging demonic disciples.

*Puff, puff, puff, puff...!*

The sound of metal and flesh being pierced was incessant. The first exchange was a shower of blood and gore.

The Primordial Origin disciples were fierce, advancing wave upon wave. The celestial formation was solid, its spears and halberds like a forest, and the immortal light shields flashed as they continuously slaughtered the approaching demonic shadows.

Every second, a large number of Qi Condensation disciples had their bodies pierced, torn apart, or incinerated to destruction.

Similarly, a massive number of celestial soldiers were struck by vicious magical treasures or thrown by self-detonations. Their silver armor shattered, their immortal light dimmed, and they screamed as they fell into the sea of clouds.

These demonic sect Qi Condensation disciples, who had managed to survive to the mid and late stages of Qi Condensation, naturally possessed unique methods.

Although many of them cultivated grand and righteous paths, everyone in the sect knew a thing or two about insidious techniques.

Filthy blood mixed with spiritual light, staining a vast area of the sea of clouds into a defiled battlefield of slaughter.

And at the very core of this brutal battlefield, in the open area between the mountains below and the clouds above, two figures had already crashed together.
