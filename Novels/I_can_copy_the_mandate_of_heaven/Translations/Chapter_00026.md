## Chapter 26: Be Cautious of Our Master

Hearing the commotion behind him, Han Li initially jumped, then continued as if nothing happened.

"What are you doing?" Li Zhi Ming walked over, puzzled, and asked. Over the past year, Han Li had grown taller, but his voice had yet to change due to his late development, and he was often teased by Li Zhi Ming.

Despite their close living arrangement, Li Zhi Ming couldn't notice much change in Han Li. 

"Got a bit injured," Han Li replied without turning his head, wincing slightly as he tightened the bandage.

Li Zhi Ming sat down beside him, resting his head on his hands, and examined Han Li's hands and ankles, which were covered in thick calluses and scars.

"What have you been up to these days?" Li Zhi Ming asked, concerned.

Han Li tried to pull his hand away, but Li Zhi Ming held on. "Nothing," Han Li muttered.

Li Zhi Ming noticed the extent of Han Li's injuries and was baffled. "Damn, what have you been doing?" 

Han Li pulled his hand back and started buttoning his shirt. "By the way, do you know our master's condition is getting worse?"

"Yeah," Li Zhi Ming replied, "he suddenly fainted for three days last time, and I had to take care of him. I don't understand what's wrong with him; he doesn't seem that old."

As they spoke, a flash of cold light crossed Han Li's eyes, but it quickly vanished. "Yeah, his body is declining," Han Li said nonchalantly.

"Sizhui," Han Li turned to Li Zhi Ming with a serious expression. "I need to tell you something. If our master takes you out privately one day, be extremely cautious!"

Li Zhi Ming's eyes widened, intrigued.

Without another word, Han Li left. Li Zhi Ming scratched his chin thoughtfully.

After a moment, Li Zhi Ming regained his composure and shouted, "Ran Ran! Let's go bathe outside with Dad!"

A fat raccoon-like creature excitedly wagged its tail and rushed in.

Time flew by, and half a year passed. Li Zhi Ming and Han Li seemed to have grown apart.

Their master's condition worsened daily, causing Li Zhi Ming considerable worry. However, after some time, their master's health suddenly improved, and he regained his previous vigor.

Li Zhi Ming rarely saw Han Li during the day, as Han Li would return late at night. His demeanor grew more ferocious and mysterious.

He stopped visiting the medicinal valley.

The herbalist seemed unconcerned.

"Da Niu!" Li Zhi Ming shouted as he approached an independent house on the half-mountain slope of the Qixuan Gate, holding a large fish.

A huge man, actually a child with a naive face, came out. He was over 1.8 meters tall.

Whenever Li Zhi Ming visited, Da Niu would be more talkative, unlike with other children.

"I caught this in the river; I'm the Dragon King," Li Zhi Ming said proudly.

Da Niu smiled and rubbed his hands. "Little Si, you brought another big fish. You know I can eat a lot."

As they entered the house, Da Niu suddenly remembered something. "Little Si, did I tell you that our master came to ask about you last year?"
