Chapter 5: Lao Cheng Also Changes Jobs

Bao Zitou felt his heart pounding with anxiety and quickly said, "Master Yang, it's not just the young mistress who is suffering. Who in the entire main branch isn't so worried they can't sleep? With the young master gone, everyone feels like they've lost their footing! I, Lao Cheng, am a rough man. I can handle a spear or a club just fine, but when it comes to using my brain, I'm useless. From now on, the main branch will have to rely entirely on you, Master Yang, to make the decisions!"

Yang Can shook his head. "Commander Cheng, please don't joke with me. I only had the good fortune to save the young master's life once. To repay the favor, the young master granted me the status of a guest retainer. How can that compare to you, Commander Cheng, who has followed the young master for many years and is now the esteemed commander of the main branch's guards?"

Bao Zitou rubbed his hands together and said sheepishly, "That's not the same! Master Yang, you are a scholar. Now that the young master is gone, the main branch, from top to bottom, desperately needs someone who can make decisions. Who else could that be but you, Master Yang?"

Yang Can said sternly, "Commander Cheng, don't say such things again. Even if the young master is no longer with us, isn't the young mistress still here? How could it be anyone else's place to issue orders?"

Bao Zitou said urgently, "Master Yang, are you truly confused or just pretending? Our Yu family and the Suo family are in-laws, but it's like a cat and a mouse living in the same house, constantly on guard against each other! The young mistress is only the young mistress while the young master was alive. Now that he's gone, what is she? She's not even as good as a decorative ornament!"

A sharp glint flashed in Yang Can's eyes, and he immediately pressed, "Commander Cheng, why do you say that?"

Bao Zitou was stunned and said in surprise, "Master Yang, you really don't know?"

Yang Can said with a puzzled expression, "Know what?"

Seeing Yang Can's completely bewildered look, Bao Zitou couldn't help but feel immensely delighted. He had been very worried that the Suo family would collude with Master Yang to push all the blame onto him. The true relationship between the Suo and Yu families was actually far from as harmonious as everyone imagined, even with the marriage alliance. If he could explain the true nature of their relationship to Master Yang, then Master Yang might not be so willing to side with the Suo family. That would greatly reduce his chances of being the scapegoat, wouldn't it?

Thinking of this, Bao Zitou grabbed Yang Can's wrist and said urgently, "Master Yang, you haven't been in the main branch for long, so you don't know the details. Come, come, let's find a place, and I, Lao Cheng, will give you the full picture!"

Bao Zitou pulled Yang Can to the side of a shallow stream and even thoughtfully brought him a bowl of fragrant, sticky rice porridge and a flatbread wrapped around some cured meat.

"Master Yang, you don't know this, but our Yu family and the Suo family, including the other six great clans, aren't really on close terms..."

With the sound of the gurgling stream, Bao Zitou couldn't wait to begin.

The stream cut through the Gobi Desert. In early March, the water from the melting snow on the distant mountains flowed gently past.

Not far away, several maidservants from the Suo family were drawing water from this stream, carrying it up the slope in buckets.

Up on the slope, inside the festive tent, as soon as Yang Can left, Suo Chanzhi returned to her large tent and ordered Little Qingmei to have the servant girls prepare a bath. The clear stream water was boiled and poured into the tub to make the bathwater.

Suo Chanzhi sat in the tub, her head resting on the edge of the tub covered with a towel, and a bath towel covering her face. Although her face was covered, this only served to highlight her other assets even more.

Qingmei used a natural sponge, which a barbarian merchant had imported from the distant "Fulin" (the Mediterranean region), to wash Suo Chanzhi's body. This natural sponge is actually a primitive marine invertebrate, with a skeleton made of soft, fibrous protein or minerals. It needs to be hand-harvested by divers, then sun-dried, beaten, and soaked to finally become a soft, usable product. Even in its place of origin, it is a luxury item only the nobility can afford. When transported to the faraway East, this "scrubbing cloth" became even more expensive.

Qingmei absentmindedly scrubbed Suo Chanzhi's body, her curious gaze occasionally wandering to her neck and chest, where faint, bluish bruises could be seen. Even though she had seen the "hidden treasures" before, Qingmei couldn't imagine the specifics of what had happened between Yang Can and Suo Chanzhi. With only a partial understanding, when she looked at the faint bluish marks, her mind conjured up all sorts of strange, quasi-erotic scenes.

Suo Chanzhi had the towel over her face, so she couldn't see Qingmei's scrutinizing gaze, yet her earlobes were gradually turning a shade of red. Perhaps it was because the bathwater was too hot; it not only made her earlobes flush, but also made her breathing a little labored, causing her chest to heave more noticeably.

She had been afraid Qingmei would see things she shouldn't, so she had stripped off her clothes and slipped into the tub while Qingmei wasn't paying attention. But in the end, some marks were impossible to hide. And this little girl just kept staring. It was enough to make her die of shame.

"Have you stared enough!" Suo Chanzhi suddenly grabbed the towel off her face and glared at Little Qingmei with a flushed face.

"Ah! No, not yet. What's there to see? What did I see?" Little Qingmei辩解道, a flurry of movement as the sponge almost fell into the water. "I... wasn't I just scrubbing for you, miss?" Qingmei explained weakly, not daring to lift her eyelids, and just kept scrubbing away at one of Suo Chanzhi's arms with the sponge.

"You're going to scrub the skin right off," Suo Chanzhi said displeased.

"Oh, oh." Little Qingmei quickly switched to another spot and continued scrubbing endlessly.

Suo Chanzhi snatched the sponge away impatiently. "Get lost, go sit over there."

"Oh, oh." Little Qingmei, wearing only a small top and pants with her arms and calves bare, obediently agreed and ran to sit on a bamboo stool.

But she didn't behave for long. Her big, dark eyes soon began to peek over again, sweeping left and right, up and down like a searchlight.

Suo Chanzhi was quite helpless about Qingmei's little movements. She really couldn't treat Qingmei like an ordinary servant girl. Qingmei was her personal maid, someone with the closest possible relationship. In front of Qingmei, she had no private matters. Before she got married, the two of them had lain side by side on the bed to study the "hidden treasures." What secrets could she possibly have from Little Qingmei?

Suo Chanzhi simply slapped the sponge into the water and glared fiercely at Little Qingmei. Her pretty face, whether from the steam or from shame, was red all over. "If you have something to ask, then ask!"

"I'm not asking, what's there for me to ask? I'm not asking. No, no, nothing to ask." Little Qingmei shook her head like a rattle-drum, but her two index fingers were poking each other. A moment later, her sneaky gaze drifted toward Suo Chanzhi's chest again.

In the end, she couldn't hold back her curiosity. Little Qingmei's eyes darted toward the strawberry-shaped marks on Suo Chanzhi.

"Get out! You get out! Get out right now!" Suo Chanzhi's composure broke. She suddenly stood up from the tub with such force that the water churned violently. Suo Chanzhi quickly sat back down, sinking her body back into the water. She pointed at the tent flap and shouted in shame and anger, "Get out right now!"

"Okay, okay, okay, I'm going, I'm going." Little Qingmei hurriedly agreed. Why did she suddenly get so angry and embarrassed? Weren't you the one who told me to ask?

Little Qingmei felt wronged, but she didn't dare talk back right now. She could see that her young mistress was genuinely angry and embarrassed. Little Qingmei scrambled out in a panic, still completely baffled.

Yang Can and Bao Zitou were crouched by the stream, each holding a large bowl. As Yang Can circled his bowl to drink his porridge, he listened to Bao Zitou explain the relationship between the Suo and Yu families, and even among the Eight Great Clans of Longshang.

According to Bao Zitou, there wasn't really any particularly close relationship between the Eight Great Clans of Longshang. As for familial ties, among the Eight Great Clans, who wasn't somehow related to the others? Each of the Eight Great Clans held sway over their own region. They both supported and restrained each other, achieving a strange balance of power.

The reason the Yu clan had allied with the Suo clan through marriage this time was for one reason only: the second branch of the main family was growing increasingly powerful and had already surpassed the first branch.

The clan leader of the Yu clan, Yu Xinglong, was from the first branch of the main family of his generation. He had a weak constitution and not many descendants. Now he only had two sons, Yu Chengye and Yu Chenglin. His second son, Yu Chenglin, was only seven years old this year.

Yu Xinglong had his eldest son, Yu Chengye, form a marriage alliance with the Suo family for the express purpose of using the Suo family's power to suppress the second branch, which was his own brother, Yu Huanhu.

The reason the Suo family had so readily agreed to the marriage with the Yu family was because the Yu family had ceded many of its commercial interests to the Suo family.

The Yu family's main business was agriculture, which was their foundation and could not be touched. The only thing they could give up was their commercial interests.

Even so, Yu Xinglong was still very cautious of the Suo family. He wanted to leverage the Suo family's power, but he didn't want their hands to reach too far into his affairs. Otherwise, it would be an awkward situation if he repelled a tiger from the front door only to have a wolf enter through the back.

From Bao Zitou's account, Yang Can learned about the conflict between the first and second branches of the Yu family's main line, as well as the truth behind the marriage alliance, where both the Yu and Suo families harbored their own ulterior motives. His eyes gradually lit up. The truth was just on the tip of his tongue!

If a person does something with all their might and without regard for risk, they must have a motive. The reason Suo Chanzhi gave him in the festive tent could be her motive, but it couldn't be Grandma Tu's motive.

Yang Can had already guessed that the one who refused to give up on this marriage was probably the Suo family; he just didn't understand their purpose. Now, after hearing Bao Zitou's words, Yang Can finally figured out what the Suo family was plotting.

If the Suo family wanted to use the marriage alliance with the Yu family's heir apparent to strengthen their control over the Yu family, then everything made sense.

As soon as he figured out the other party's purpose, Yang Can immediately began to silently deduce the situation in his mind:

After Yu Chengye's death, Grandma Tu immediately sent two messengers to the Suo and Yu families to report the death. This meant that at that time, Grandma Tu couldn't have thought of the "seed-borrowing plan," so the people she sent were purely there to report the news. Therefore, this "seed-borrowing plan" should currently be known only to him, Suo Chanzhi, Grandma Tu, and Qingmei.

However, that might not be the case for long. Once Grandma Tu sends a second messenger, she will very likely report the seed-borrowing plan to the Suo family. And once the higher-ups of the Suo family know about this, even if they don't want to silence him, he will only be able to become a puppet of the Suo family.

So... first, he had to stop the information from spreading further.

But how to stop it?

Yang Can thought for a moment, then suddenly looked up at Bao Zitou. I, the best man, have already changed jobs to become the groom. So, Lao Cheng can also change jobs to become the "Timely Rain"!
