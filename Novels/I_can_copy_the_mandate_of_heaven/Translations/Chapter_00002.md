Chapter 2: Heaven's Mandate

Zhang Jing gazed out at the courtyard filled with rural children, his patience wearing thin. As a cultivator of weak renown, he had been tasked by the Xuan Guang Sect to scour the countryside for children with spiritual roots, a thankless job if there ever was one. The odds were against him; only one in tens of thousands possessed the innate talent required for cultivation.

As he watched the children, a stout, short boy with a runny nose approached him. "Turn around and lift up your clothes a bit," Zhang Jing instructed, his voice devoid of emotion.

The boy complied, and Zhang Jing's fingers danced across the back of his neck. Suddenly, his expression changed, and he grasped the boy's neck with an eagle-like claw. After a few moments, Zhang Jing's face lit up with excitement. "This child has a spiritual root!"

The courtyard erupted into chaos as the onlookers surged forward, their faces a mix of shock, envy, and excitement. A portly merchant rushed into the fray, beaming with joy, and lifted his son into the air, only to gently set him back down and kiss his forehead. "My son will become an immortal!"

Zhang Jing smiled, his face radiant with warmth. "Congratulations, sir. You may prepare to relocate to the jurisdiction of our Xuan Guang Sect, along with your son." The Xuan Guang Sect was a distant and revered institution, home to the descendants of immortal disciples.

As the crowd dispersed, Li Zhi Ming, an eight-year-old boy, watched the commotion with a mixture of confusion and wonder. His father, Li Chu Jiu, leaned in and whispered, "How did you know, son?" Li Zhi Ming shook his head, still dazed.

As they left the county yamen, Li Zhi Ming's family walked in silence, their footsteps heavy with disappointment. Li Chu Jiu attempted to lighten the mood with a joke, but Li Zhi Ming couldn't shake off the feeling of despondency.

As they traversed the mountain path, the darkness deepened, and the stars twinkled above. Li Chu Jiu carried Li Zhi Ming on his back, and as the boy drifted off to sleep, he gazed up at his father's head and saw a line of black text: "Fate Grid: Forty Years of Toil."

Li Zhi Ming's eyes widened as he looked at his own reflection and saw another line of text: "Fate Grid: Fourteen Years, Early Demise." He glanced at his mother, Cháng Shì, and saw yet another ominous message: "Fate Grid: Wrapped in a Straw Mat, Lifeless."

The weight of their fate grids settled upon Li Zhi Ming, and he couldn't help but wonder what the future held for them.
