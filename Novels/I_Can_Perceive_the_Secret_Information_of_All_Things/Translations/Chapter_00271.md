# Chapter 271: The First Strand of Incense Received – The Value of Collecting Devotional Power

The first wisp of incense rose from Tianzhu Mountain.

Xiao Ji was absolutely certain it was the aura of devotional incense. 

By analyzing that strand of incense energy, he made a startling discovery—he could now harvest the power of faith. 

In this world, including the enigmatic celestial realms, devotional power had always been the most precious source of energy. This was why many who had already achieved immortality and become revered ancestors still reminded their descendants to burn incense devoutly. Managing one's sacred site wasn't just about legacy—the primary purpose was to gather this faith energy.

For deities and celestial beings with divine manifestations, their emphasis on incense offerings was essentially a win-win situation: you provide me with incense, and I'll protect your community and fulfill your wishes.

However, as time passed, many deities seemed to have forgotten their duties, only demanding offerings. When incense wasn't sufficient, they'd punish their followers; when sated, they wouldn't actively help their devotees. Gradually, some people lost their faith, relying only on themselves.

Though already a Nascent Soul powerhouse, Xiao Ji was exhilarated when he first tasted this incense energy. He rushed into a tavern to feast, using delicious food to suppress his temporary excitement.

After the meal, he immediately returned to Tianzhu Mountain.

Tianzhu Mountain was Xiao Ji's purchased sacred site—modest in scale with only five peaks. His veiled divine manifestation stood on the central "finger." 

The mountain wasn't particularly high.

...

From afar, though he hadn't seen it often, Tianzhu Mountain's silhouette felt unusually familiar.

During Xiao Ji's absence, Zhao Jiuzhou had managed Tianzhu Mountain remarkably well. Stone steps had been built on all five peaks, allowing ordinary people to ascend easily from the base to the summit. Rest areas and exaggerated decorative landscapes were thoughtfully placed along the paths.

The structures on the five peaks were already constructed—not particularly grand, but orderly with all necessary functional buildings.

The most impressive was the main hall on the central Middle Finger Peak.

Ascending the stone steps to the summit revealed a flat plaza resembling a fingertip, with another peak above it like a fingernail. Before this "nail" stood a simple yet majestic main hall, as if something were lodged beneath a person's nail.

The hall's plaque bore three large characters: "Hall of Negation."

Xiao Ji didn't understand why Zhao Jiuzhou had chosen such a pessimistic name, which made people feel disheartened before even entering.

Currently, Tianzhu Mountain had almost no visitors, and no villages had migrated to its foothills.

Stepping into the main hall, Xiao Ji saw only Qian Duoyu's pet guarding the place. The winged tiger Tianyi sat before the donation box, now grown quite large like a divine beast descended from heaven, its wings folded behind it with an intimidating gaze.

Zhao Jiuzhou was absent, as the genius artificer was busy resolving issues with the low-grade magical tool production line. Inspired by Xiao Ji's theories, he had made some breakthroughs and was now deep in contemplation—effectively in seclusion like any dedicated artificer.

Before entering the mountain, Xiao Ji had known what Zhao Jiuzhou was working on, so he didn't disturb him immediately. Instead, he went to the main hall to find Qian Duoyu, as something important was happening there that required his prompt attention.

The reason: a devotee was sitting on a prayer mat in the main hall.

The devotee faced the veiled divine manifestation, not daring to move an inch.

Xiao Ji understood immediately upon entering—the devotee was frozen because Tianyi was watching him, its wings spreading threateningly at any movement.

Who wouldn't be terrified?

"Elder Tiger, I truly have no more money... Please let me go. I've donated all my silver, burned incense, and made my wish..." The devotee looked utterly exhausted, as if nearing his limit.

Xiao Ji suddenly sensed a trace of negative emotion—subtle, but not escaping his perception.

Upon investigation, he realized the earlier wisp of incense energy had mutated. Only then did he understand: to truly obtain incense energy, one must either fulfill the devotee's request or wait until they forgot about it. 

If devotees cared deeply about their wishes and expected divine response, prolonged silence would make them doubt the deity's efficacy, causing the incense energy to corrupt into "dust of doubt" that could affect one's Dao Heart.

"Indeed, when people spend silver to feed you incense, you ought to do something in return," Xiao Ji mused.

He didn't immediately intervene between Tianyi and the devotee, instead delving into his consciousness to process the incense energy.

If he wasn't mistaken, this first strand of incense must have come from the poor devotee trapped in Tianzhu Mountain's Middle Finger Peak.

[Your first devotee sincerely wishes you'd demonstrate your divine power by making the winged tiger leave. He wants to return home safely—his greatest desire. But he now thinks the veiled deity might be ineffective...]

[He was merely passing by Tianzhu Mountain, saw the incense site, and decided to burn some incense, hoping his merchant journey would earn enough silver to buy land and marry...]

[Donated: 326 taels and 78 copper coins...]

[His mood is deeply despondent, bordering on despair.]

Unlike ordinary perception, understanding incense wishes allowed Xiao Ji to clearly see the devotee's desires, their donations, and even their emotional fluctuations.

"Tianyi, this isn't where you belong," Xiao Ji said upon entering—his first words in the hall.

Recognizing Xiao Ji, Tianyi shook its wings, stretched lazily, gave a low growl, and flew out of the hall.

[Devotee's wish fulfilled. Satisfied, he now believes the veiled deity is effective. Incense Value +1.]

"Why is there suddenly an 'Incense Value'?" Xiao Ji wondered.

He checked his status panel:

[Name: Xiao Ji]
[Age: 31]
[Affiliation: Primordial Divinity Temple]
[Spiritual Roots: Fluctuating, variable quantity]
[Realm: Early Nascent Soul (36,542/100,000)]
[Techniques: ...]
[Incense Value: 1]
[Perception Radius: 500 km]

Indeed, an "Incense Value" had appeared—just a single point.

Xiao Ji immediately sought to understand this new metric through perception. He needed to know its purpose.

[Incense Value stems from devotees' faith in you, determined by frequency and quantity of incense offerings. You can use it to alter an individual's fate, a region's fortune, or even a nation's destiny. With sufficient Incense Value, you may suppress calamities...]

The benefits of accumulating Incense Value were numerous, making it worthwhile.

Now understanding incense's importance, Xiao Ji turned to his first devotee, who had fainted in the hall. 

It wasn't serious—the man was alive but weakened from lack of food, water, and prolonged terror. For days, he'd survived on rations, donating silver whenever Tianyi seemed threatening.

In truth, Tianyi wouldn't have harmed him even if he'd left—the winged tiger knew what it could and couldn't eat. Its fearsome appearance simply caused misunderstandings.

The blame lay with Qian Duoyu, who'd put Tianyi in charge of the donation box while he patrolled the mountain, thinking it didn't matter since visitors were rare.

Xiao Ji treated the devotee kindly, offering a meal upon awakening, a free divination to avoid dangers on his merchant journey, and guidance to profitable locations—resolving the matter fully.

After the devotee left happily, Zhao Jiuzhou emerged from seclusion, having made progress on the assembly line issues.

Xiao Ji questioned the "Hall of Negation" name, finding it inauspicious. But Zhao Jiuzhou's explanation—"A hall to eliminate all extreme misfortune," coupled with the phonetic similarity to Xiao Ji's name—was oddly convincing.

Ultimately, Xiao Ji accepted it. A mountain's efficacy wasn't tied to its hall's name, and the title grew on him.

Though Tianzhu Mountain had received its first incense, the road ahead was long. The area within 500 km was sparsely populated, with only one official road passing through. To sustain incense offerings, villages—eventually towns—needed to flourish at the mountain's base.

Now aware of incense's benefits, Xiao Ji desired more. But his immediate focus was Zhao Jiuzhou's assembly line.

The first low-grade magical tool assembly line would produce storage devices. 

Existing storage tools required at least Qi Refinement Level 6 to use—not because weaker versions were impossible, but because they weren't cost-effective to make. Xiao Ji had shared rudimentary concepts of mechanical assembly lines from his past life, which Zhao Jiuzhou quickly grasped.

Materials, spirit stones, and the production site were nearly ready—only the main structural material remained. Ordinary black iron would wear out in three years, failing to recoup costs. A superior material was needed.

Thus emerged the concept of "alloyed black iron." 

While not novel to artificers—elite smiths knew how to forge it—sourcing ingredients was challenging. Tianzhu Mountain's development seemed stalled.

But Xiao Ji soon proposed a solution: the Hundred Weapons Secret Realm within the Divine Armory Valley.

Such a place surely housed exceptional weapons that could be repurposed as materials.

"I'll visit the Hundred Weapons Secret Realm. If suitable materials exist, I'll bring some back," Xiao Ji said.

If the Divine Armory Valley truly concealed a secret realm, others might not find it—but Xiao Ji could.

Zhao Jiuzhou brightened at the mention of a weapons-related secret realm: "Brother Xiao, take me along. I may be of help."

While Zhao Jiuzhou might be a liability in combat, his expertise in selecting materials was irreplaceable—artificers relied on unique inspiration.

"Very well. We'll depart on an auspicious day," Xiao Ji agreed.

Qian Duoyu wanted to join but was left to guard the mountain, with strict instructions to keep Tianyi away from devotees. Donations must be voluntary—forced incense offerings could harm one's Dao Heart.

The veiled manifestation contained Xiao Ji's likeness and a personal artifact, creating a strong connection. Prolonged exposure to corrupted incense energy could affect his mental state.

Consulting an almanac, Xiao Ji set the departure date.

In the intervening days, he patrolled Tianzhu Mountain with Tianyi, erecting guideposts along traveler routes to attract visitors. The effort bore fruit—over a dozen travelers came, each donating silver and burning incense for blessings.
