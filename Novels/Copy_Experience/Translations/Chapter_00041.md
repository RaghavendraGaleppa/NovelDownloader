# Chapter 41: Tan Hu's Elder Brother

"Thud!"

A small, earthy-yellow seal was thrown onto the table.

Seeing the earthy-yellow seal, Gao Tianqiang's expression suddenly changed, and he exclaimed, "This is Xiaohu's Profound Rock Seal?!"

"Yes, this is Xiaohu's Profound Rock Seal!" The burly man, who had unknowingly returned to his chair, repeated in a low voice. "Some time ago, this magical artifact appeared in a woman's hands, seen by one of our brothers hidden here! After I came out, I killed that woman and learned from her that she obtained this artifact from a secret market trade fair in Tianmen City!"

Hearing the burly man's words, Gao Tianqiang's expression changed again, finally letting out a bitter laugh: "And during this period, I just happened to report to the society that the Talisman Master had appeared in Tianmen City, so Brother Long, you deduced that Xiaohu was killed by this Talisman Master?"

"Heh, not only that, I also know that the leader once wanted to abduct this Talisman Master, and for that, he promised Xiaohu a Barrier-Breaking Pill!" The burly man lowered his head, speaking in a faint, eerie voice, "You've been stuck at the late-Qi Condensation bottleneck for a long time, haven't you? You should know how important a Barrier-Breaking Pill is! Xiaohu, like you, has a mid-low spiritual root. After reaching the sixth level, he would also be trapped at the late-stage bottleneck for over a decade, just like you. I don't need to tell you how tempting a Barrier-Breaking Pill would be for him! Combining all these factors, I understood that Xiaohu's death must be related to this Talisman Master! But, I really want to know, Ah Qiang, did you get involved in this matter? Is Xiaohu's death related to you?" The burly man suddenly raised his head, his eyes like electricity, staring coldly at Gao Tianqiang.

Gao Tianqiang's expression, on the contrary, calmed down. He shook his head, "Brother Long, you're actually suspecting me. To be honest, I did earn some spirit stones by purchasing talismans, but to harm Xiaohu just for that little bit of spirit stones, Brother Long, you think too little of me, Gao Tianqiang! Xiaohu is your brother, but to me, he was also a dear friend, a brother!"

"If that's the case, why didn't you tell me the truth?"

"Brother Long, do I not know your personality? If you knew the truth, you would definitely kill this person! But this person's success rate in crafting talismans is so high, his talismans are very important to our Black Robe Society, so I couldn't let you act recklessly!"

"You're wrong, Ah Qiang, I won't kill him. I'll break his legs, keep his hands intact, and control him, making him draw talismans for our Black Robe Society until he dies! This also aligns with the leader's wishes!" A cruel smile appeared at the corner of the burly man's mouth.

Hearing this, Gao Tianqiang shook his head again: "He is already a fifth-level Qi Condensation cultivator, and judging by the spirit stones in his possession, he'll probably enter the sixth level of Qi Condensation in just a few years! For someone like that, Brother Long, you can defeat him or kill him, but capturing him alive might not be so easy! Once you fail to act, this person will definitely sever all ties with us, and this source of talismans will disappear! Therefore, unless the society sends a ninth or tenth-level Qi Condensation expert to assist you, I will absolutely not give you this person's contact information!"

The burly man fell silent upon hearing this. Just as Gao Tianqiang understood him well, he also understood Gao Tianqiang well. He knew that since the other party said so, they would never yield to him. And he couldn't really do anything to Gao Tianqiang. As for ninth or tenth-level Qi Condensation experts? Qinghu Market City was already surrounded by the allied forces of the three families. How could experts of that level be sent out? His own presence here was a result of taking immense risks and employing various methods to succeed.

"With you and I working together, it wouldn't be hard to capture him!" the burly man said again.

Gao Tianqiang shook his head repeatedly: "He's always very cautious. I only know he's in this city, but I can't track his movements. I have no idea when he goes out. Brother Long, you're not planning for us to team up and capture him right here, are you?" Gao Tianqiang said, looking as if it were completely impossible.

Acting within Tianmen City was, of course, impossible, unless they both considered their lives too long.

"You can try to arrange for him to come out!" the burly man said again.

Gao Tianqiang still shook his head upon hearing this: "He doesn't trust me. As soon as I suggest a transaction outside the city, he'll immediately cut off all contact with me! And we don't know what methods he has. Maybe he even has a late-Qi Condensation helper by his side? When Xiaohu died back then, he was only at the third level of Qi Condensation! Brother Long, I don't recommend you take this risk. I won't help you. The Black Robe Society needs this Talisman Master to continue providing us with talismans!"

After hearing this, the burly man's large hand gripped the armrest of the chair tightly, gradually twisting it. Clearly, his mood was far from calm. But after a long while, he suddenly let out a laugh: "Alright, Ah Qiang, you stick to what you believe, and I'll stick to what I believe! Since you're unwilling to help me, then so be it. I won't force you! This time I came to deliver spirit stones to you. The leader's Soul Pennant was damaged some time ago, so the Five Ghosts Transporting Spell can't be used. You'll have to wait another one or two months after you buy the talismans!"

Gao Tianqiang's expression also relaxed a bit upon hearing this: "Brother Long, it's good that you've understood. It's not suitable for us to act against that person right now! But I promise you, once this period of unrest is over, if you decide to deal with this person, I, Gao Tianqiang, will definitely risk my life to help you!"

"Good, good, good! Ah Qiang, with your words, I'm relieved. We're still good brothers!" The burly man said, taking a bag full of spirit stones from his storage bag, placing it on the table, and then turned and left.

Gao Tianqiang watched his receding back, feeling a slight relief in his heart. He was truly afraid that this short-tempered old friend would cause trouble here.

Some time after the burly man left, the gate of Gao Tianqiang's small courtyard was suddenly knocked on again. He went forward to open the door and saw that the person was Lu Xu.

"What a coincidence, if Fellow Daoist Lu had arrived a little earlier, he would have run into Brother Long, and that wouldn't have been a pretty sight!" Gao Tianqiang felt a sense of relief in his heart, and he quickly showed a smile on his face: "Brother Lu, I've been waiting for you for a long time!"

Lu Xu also smiled slightly: "Brother Gao, after this transaction, I'll probably stop for a while, so this is the last batch of talismans!"

"Oh? Why is that?" Gao Tianqiang's face showed surprise. Immediately, he seemed to have a sudden realization: "That's right, Brother Lu, you've probably accumulated enough spirit stones, are you going into seclusion to break through to the sixth level of Qi Condensation this time?"

Lu Xu merely smiled faintly, not explaining to the other party. The cultivation level he displayed to Gao Tianqiang was fifth-level Qi Condensation, and the other party had never used the Spirit Eye Technique to inspect him directly, thus not knowing his true cultivation.

"This time, it's two hundred low-grade first-tier talismans!" Lu Xu took out a bag and handed it to the other party.

Gao Tianqiang took the bag and looked inside, then suddenly smiled: "Brother Lu, you've made so many talismans, and you still haven't become a mid-grade Talisman Master? With your success rate in crafting talismans, you should have become a mid-grade Talisman Master long ago, shouldn't you? If you have mid-grade talismans, we're willing to buy them at a high price!"

Lu Xu showed a trace of helplessness on his face upon hearing this, shaking his head repeatedly: "Brother Gao, I've said it many times, these talismans are not made by me alone! How could anyone in this world craft so many talismans by themselves? Why do you insist on not believing me?"

Gao Tianqiang smiled noncommittally, taking out the bag of spirit stones that the burly man had given him earlier from his storage bag. After counting, Gao Tianqiang handed two hundred of the spirit stones to Lu Xu.

After the two completed the transaction, they chatted casually for a few more sentences, and then Lu Xu walked out of Gao Tianqiang's courtyard.

After he left, a while later, the burly man's figure suddenly appeared there. He first glanced at Gao Tianqiang's courtyard with a cold sneer, then his gaze turned to the direction Lu Xu had left.

"Buzz! Buzz!"

A rice-grain sized flying insect flew out from his sleeve, circled in the air for a bit, then flew in the direction Lu Xu had departed. The burly man then followed.
