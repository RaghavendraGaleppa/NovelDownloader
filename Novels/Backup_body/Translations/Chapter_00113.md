# Chapter 113: The Identity of the Fake Medicine Peddler  

The Kunlun Sect's Young Master ignored all warnings and chased after the Yellow Dog Immortal.  

Before leaving, Li Zhengjing shouted, asking if their previous bet still stood. The Kunlun Young Master turned a deaf ear and vanished into the horizon.  

"Even if he intended to honor the bet, if he dies at the hands of the Golden Ship of Salvation, he won't be able to fulfill it," Hanging Bird poked its head out and remarked.  

"He won't die," Ghost Valley Lingguan stepped forward and said, "In the earlier battle, he made a bet with Young Friend Zhengjing. To ensure fairness, he relied solely on his own strength to defeat the Five Dou Divine King, a true immortal, without using any inherited treasures from the Kunlun Immortal Sect!"  

Currently, the Ten Thousand Calamities Salvation Heavenly Lord was severely injured and couldn’t act recklessly. The Kunlun Young Master, relying solely on his own abilities, was already capable of suppressing the Fifth Helmsman Immortal.  

With the inherited treasures of the Kunlun Immortal Sect in hand, even if he faced the combined forces of multiple helmsmen, he could still escape with his life.  

Moreover, he wouldn’t be going alone—he would surely have the support of other human immortals from the Kunlun Sect.  

From this battle, it was clear that the Kunlun Young Master had waited for Li Zhengjing’s arrival to join forces and slay the enemy. This showed he was no longer the arrogant youth who once relied solely on his sword to challenge the world alone. If he dared to follow the Five Dou Divine King, he must have a well-thought-out plan.  

"The Raging Monk is dead, but the human-bone prayer beads remain. Unlike the boarding pass, these beads will continue to harm the living over time."  

Ghost Valley Lingguan spoke up, "Although you previously announced to the world that he was an evil monk, the villagers who once worshipped him with devout faith won’t be swayed by mere words. We must retrieve these prayer beads..."  

Yuan Zhengfeng’s voice chimed in, "Additionally, the local officials must have colluded with the Raging Monk. Otherwise, how could such a bizarre temple exist and spread its influence without the Great Zhou Dynasty noticing?"  

As they pondered how to handle the aftermath, a paper crane slowly flew over and hovered in the air.  

Li Zhengjing looked up, his gaze sharpening.  

Hanging Bird whispered, "It's the fake medicine peddler."  

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its roots and asked, "Why is he following us?"  

Ghost Valley Lingguan looked up, his golden pupils narrowing slightly, but he remained silent.  

From the paper crane came the voice of the fake medicine peddler.  

"How about letting me handle the aftermath here?"  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing suddenly laughed. "You’re someone who never acts without profit. Why the sudden kindness?"  

The paper crane sighed. "I, too, care for the people. How could I bear to see them suffer?"  

Though Li Zhengjing didn’t know the peddler’s true intentions, he guessed that taking over the aftermath would bring the man significant benefits.  

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin. "If I let you handle this, how many spirit stones will you give me?"  

The paper crane’s voice turned indignant. "Senior Brother Li, I’m here to help you with the aftermath!"  

Li Zhengjing replied calmly, "Then how about changing the material?"  

The paper crane fell silent for a moment before responding, "For the health and longevity of the villagers... fine. What do you want?"  

Li Zhengjing’s tone turned serious. "Heavenly Profound White Gold!"  

The paper crane remained silent for a long time before replying, "That’s not something that exists in this world. How do you know of it?"  

Li Zhengjing asked slowly, "If it’s not of this world, then what is it?"  

The fake medicine peddler’s voice came through the paper crane. "It’s a divine metal of the immortals, far beyond mortal comprehension."  

Li Zhengjing patted his sleeves. "But you’re no ordinary mortal either. Cut the nonsense—will you give me the Heavenly Profound White Gold or not?"  

The fake medicine peddler sighed. "How can you be so sure I have it?"  

Li Zhengjing didn’t answer, simply staring at the paper crane with an unreadable expression.  

"I have a fragment the size of a fingernail," the peddler said. "But these villagers aren’t worth that much. You’ll need to compensate me..."  

His tone was indifferent as he continued, "I’ve heard the Jia family’s craftsmen are highly skilled, having built many temples for the Diamond Monastery. Have them send workers to the Fallen Dragon Heavenly Grotto. The villagers are too slow—after all these days, they’ve only built three houses. Many are still exposed to the elements. It’s unacceptable..."  

Li Zhengjing nodded. "Deal. I’ll leave a letter here. Once you arrive, send someone to deliver it to the Jia family in Qinghai. My uncle will dispatch workers to the Fallen Dragon Heavenly Grotto."  

The fake medicine peddler emphasized, "The Heavenly Profound White Gold is the payment, so I won’t be giving you any silver!"  

Li Zhengjing kicked the Raging Monk’s head. "Once you get here, use this to claim the bounty from the Great Zhou Dynasty. That’ll be enough. With my letter, the Jia family won’t charge you for this job."  

He paused, then added, "The local officials colluded with the Raging Monk, treating human lives as worthless. Handle them as you see fit."  

"Understood!"  

Meanwhile, in the Fallen Dragon Heavenly Grotto...  

The fake medicine peddler watched the villagers constructing houses behind him and sighed. "I’ve truly become useless, so weak now..."  

He looked in the direction where Li Zhengjing had gone and thought, "The villagers there are simple and easily deceived by the Raging Monk, offering abundant faith and devotion. Once I arrive, I’ll collect the human-bone prayer beads, save them, and redirect their faith from the evil monk to the Netherworld’s Lord of Judgment. Everything will be settled."  

As he pondered, he flipped his hand, revealing a small, dull-white fragment the size of a fingernail.  

"I’ve had this fragment for nearly twenty years."  

"It’s truly useless now. Trading it for something beneficial isn’t a loss."  

"But how does this kid know about the Heavenly Profound White Gold?"  

"The source of the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi and the Heavenly Profound White Gold both trace back to the 'Emperor-Slaying Rebel Immortal.' Has Li Zhengjing found clues about it?"  

"If so, can I extract information about the Rebel Immortal from him?"  

"That old bastard and I both seek the corpse of the Emperor-Slaying Rebel Immortal to seize his true immortal body."  

"But I can keep searching. That old man is nearing his end and can’t wait any longer..."  

With these thoughts, the fake medicine peddler pocketed the Heavenly Profound White Gold and called out to the villagers, "I’m leaving for a while to bring back workers to build our new homes!"  

With that, he set off personally, leaving the heavenly grotto.  

By the time he arrived at the Raging Monk’s location, Li Zhengjing and his group had already departed southeast.  

Another six thousand li, and they would reach the coastal region.  

Li Zhengjing looked ahead and said, "With the Fifth Helmsman Immortal defeated and the Kunlun Young Master infiltrating their stronghold, the Golden Ship of Salvation likely won’t send more assassins."  

His mind was preoccupied with the Heavenly Profound White Gold. The fake medicine peddler had promised to have it delivered to the southeast.  

Though it was only the size of a fingernail—insufficient to forge a sword core—it could at least be used to store sword qi within his body.  

He had a premonition: the moment he broke through to the human immortal realm would be the moment of his death.  

But even before that, if he reached the peak of true qi, his suffering would be unbearable.  

With the Heavenly Blue Dao Treasure healing his injuries, he wouldn’t die from the sword qi backlash at the peak of true qi. However, the overflowing sword qi would constantly injure him, and the Heavenly Blue Dao Treasure would continuously heal him—a cycle of endless torment worse than death by a thousand cuts.  

But with the Heavenly Profound White Gold, even a tiny fragment could serve as a vessel for the sword qi, sparing him from perpetual agony.  

Meanwhile, inside the Phoenix Wood Box, Yuan Zhengfeng was studying Buddhist techniques.  

In theory, the faith and devotion of the masses could only be gathered through Heavenly Domain Divine Stones, allowing one’s divine body to attain a second life. However, the endless impurities within would eventually erode one’s consciousness, transforming them into someone else—like the Southern Domain Mother, once the Heavenly Jun King.  

But Buddhist techniques were different!  

"Buddhist cultivators are flesh-and-blood beings, yet they can harness faith like false gods."  

Yuan Zhengfeng mused, "Buddhism has spread far and wide, amassing countless devotees. Their use of faith rivals that of divine beings! If I can fully comprehend this..."  

Currently residing within the Netherworld’s Lord of Judgment’s remains, his soul’s decay had slowed drastically.  

He was less than a hundred years old, and after attaining human immortality, his soul had solidified, granting him a lifespan of a thousand years. Within the Lord of Judgment’s remains, he could survive for three to five thousand years.  

If he could harness faith, perhaps—as Ghost Valley Lingguan said—his soul would endure eternally, free from decay.  

Thus, he was deeply invested in studying Buddhist methods.  

After the Raging Monk’s death, the three hundred spirit stones, Buddhist scriptures, heretical techniques, and his personal cultivation notes had all fallen into Li Zhengjing’s hands. This allowed Yuan Zhengfeng to study the Raging Monk’s path—or more accurately, the Buddhist path.  

"The Raging Monk defected from the Cloud Void Monastery, seized power at the Southern Void Monastery, and sought to restore its former glory after its destruction."  

Ghost Valley Lingguan explained, "That’s why he possessed all the Southern Void Monastery’s scriptures—cultivation methods, divine abilities, artifact forging techniques, and more. These were the foundation for rebuilding his faction."  

Yuan Zhengfeng understood. "So these texts contain the complete path from the basics to the Arhat’s Golden Body. If I were to convert to Buddhism, I’d have a clear roadmap... But I’m a human immortal. Switching to Buddhism seems inappropriate..."  

Listening to their conversation, Li Zhengjing had a thought.  

Did the fake medicine peddler want to handle the aftermath to harvest the villagers’ faith?  

Previously, he only knew that false gods with Heavenly Domain Divine Stones could harness faith. Now, since Buddhists could also gather faith with their fleshly bodies, perhaps the fake medicine peddler could do the same.  

"Senior Ghost Valley, when worldly experts interact with mortals and conduct business, is there any deeper meaning?" Li Zhengjing suddenly asked.  

"Worldly experts sever mortal ties to transcend the mundane. Why would such a person exist?" Ghost Valley Lingguan was puzzled. "Unless he seeks mortal connections. But all living beings are born into this world, inherently bound to it... Unless one ascends to immortality, even human immortals cannot fully escape the world’s constraints."  

"So if such a person exists, he’s deliberately strengthening his ties to the mortal realm?" Li Zhengjing realized.  

"Unless he isn’t from this world!" Ghost Valley Lingguan’s gaze fell on the little dragon girl.  

"I wasn’t referring to her," Li Zhengjing said. "I meant the person behind the paper crane."  

"That paper crane... I can’t discern its origins," Ghost Valley Lingguan mused. "You say he roams the world, trading with you for gold and silver?"  

"Exactly," Li Zhengjing confirmed.  

"Worldly karma is tied to wealth," Ghost Valley Lingguan pondered. "The more wealth he amasses, the deeper his ties to the mortal realm. Is he deliberately anchoring himself here? I’ve never heard of such a thing..."  

"Perhaps he can’t stay in this world for long," Yuan Zhengfeng suggested. "By deepening his mortal connections, he can remain?"  

"The little dragon girl said she’s seen him before," Li Zhengjing thought aloud. "Is he from another world?"  

"Maybe he’s from the heavenly realm—a true immortal descending to earth?" Yuan Zhengfeng speculated.  

"Have you all forgotten someone?" Ghost Valley Lingguan produced a broken jade fragment.  

"The Netherworld’s Lord of Judgment?" Li Zhengjing’s eyes narrowed. "After arriving from the underworld, he vanished. Did he use this method to hide from the underworld’s call, anchoring himself to the mortal realm?"  

"He’s the Netherworld’s Lord of Judgment? The true form of this jade fragment I inhabit?" Yuan Zhengfeng was stunned.  

"These are just guesses," Ghost Valley Lingguan said. "But his paper crane technique is unlike any worldly art. His origins are extraordinary. If he isn’t the creditor, perhaps he could be an ally..."  

"If he’s truly the Netherworld’s Lord of Judgment, he’s a true god!" Hanging Bird exclaimed. "We could ally with him against the creditor!"  

"Then even if the creditor is a true immortal, we wouldn’t fear him," the Five Elements Creation Tree added.  

"Things might not be so simple," Li Zhengjing began, but before he could finish, the little dragon girl froze.  

With a clatter, the object in her hand fell to the ground, and she began trembling uncontrollably.  

Li Zhengjing rushed to her side. Her face was pale, and she couldn’t speak, only lifting a tiny finger toward the sky.  

Li Zhengjing looked up and saw a blinding light descending from the heavens!  

Ghost Valley Lingguan, Hanging Bird, the Five Elements Creation Tree, and even Yuan Zhengfeng’s senses all turned skyward.  

The light split into ten beams, scattering across the world.  

"What is that?"  

A deep unease gripped Li Zhengjing’s heart.  

The little dragon girl trembled and uttered a single phrase:  

"The omen of the world’s end."
