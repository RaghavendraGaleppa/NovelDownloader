# Chapter 67: The Great Demonic Sect

Lin Shan was experiencing extreme emotional highs and lows, his mind a tangled mess. 

The former lover of Immortal Huang had become the madam of a brothel? Should he pocket these 80 spirit stones or not?

...

Perhaps concerned about Luan Chun's first day receiving customers, the madam soon came over from the front. Seeing the young girl's flustered appearance, she smiled apologetically. "Young master, has Luan Chun done something to displease you?"

Lin Shan observed the still-charming madam. Stripped of her title, she was an alluring beauty. Her eyes held a bewitching charm—had she been younger, she would likely have been the most famous courtesan in Yichuan. 

But the question was—could Immortal Huang have afforded such a top courtesan in his youth?

Gathering his courage, Lin Shan spoke: "I was entrusted by an old acquaintance of yours—a certain Huang."

To his surprise, at these words, the madam's lips parted slightly as she froze in place, her embroidered fan clattering to the floor.

Lin Shan was equally stunned. Could it be that the lecherous old man Huang had actually...

After a long silence, the madam regained her composure, bending to pick up the fan. From his angle, Lin Shan inadvertently caught a glimpse of her ample bosom.

"Don't look at what you shouldn't! Don't look!" 

Lin Shan quickly averted his gaze, chanting inwardly while feeling a pang of envy. How did Immortal Huang get so lucky?

The madam gave Lin Shan a complex look. "Come to the second room on the second floor after the third watch." With that, she left.

Luan Chun stared blankly at Lin Shan, still processing his earlier question about redeeming the madam...

Lin Shan, meanwhile, found the midnight rendezvous rather peculiar.

...

The tea on the table had been drained, and all the fruits had been stuffed into his storage pouch. Lin Shan felt his three spirit stones had been wasted and did his best to recoup some losses.

When the time came, Luan Chun asked if he wanted to extend his stay. Lin Shan firmly declined! 

But under her tearful pleas and the judging stares of nearby cultivators ("Are you even a man?"), he reluctantly handed over one spirit stone as a tip.

Luan Chun thanked him profusely, promising to repay him properly once she earned her freedom. 

Lin Shan said nothing, silently chewing on the fruits he'd pocketed from the table—they suddenly tasted bitterly unsatisfying.

...

As the third watch approached, no new customers entered, and the existing ones had all retired to private rooms with their companions. The performance stage in the hall stood empty.

After sitting alone for a long time, Lin Shan rose and headed upstairs, pushing open the door to the second room. Inside sat the madam who had received him earlier.

"You're quite punctual."

Lin Shan offered an awkward smile, unsure how to begin.

The woman teased lightly, "How did you find little Luan Chun? Did you like her?"

Lin Shan answered honestly, "Her story is tragic—sold here at such a young age."

"She's a qingguan, not a prostitute. And she came here voluntarily as a free woman."

Lin Shan: "..."

His innocent heart suffered a critical hit.

The madam didn't keep him waiting long before getting to the point. "That old man told me to wait for him, then vanished for twenty years. What, did he suddenly remember me now?"

Lin Shan hesitated. "Brother Huang was nearing the end of his lifespan. He asked me to deliver these spirit stones and a letter..."

"Where is he now?"

"Dead."

The moment the words left his mouth, an overwhelming spiritual pressure flooded the room.

"Boom!"

Lin Shan instantly felt like a drowning man—his throat constricted, his breath stolen, his entire body probed by countless tendrils of divine sense. The suffocating terror froze his thoughts, his spiritual power ceased flowing, and his soul seemed suspended in time. His vacant eyes reflected only the figure before him.

The madam's face was icy, shrouded in rolling dark mist and murderous aura—like a demonic overlord!

Then, as suddenly as it came, the pressure vanished. Lin Shan slumped against the doorframe, drenched in sweat.

...

After a long silence, under the madam's demand, a trembling Lin Shan recounted everything from his journey to Yichuan. He then handed over Immortal Huang's storage pouch—though he'd originally been promised 20 stones for safely escorting Huang to Yichuan, he couldn't bring himself to claim them now.

Not that he dared.

The madam took the pouch, staring blankly at the 80 spirit stones inside before her eyes reddened slightly. She then read the letter.

Time ticked by as Lin Shan sat rigidly, recalling the terrifying pressure and praying for this ordeal to end so he could flee far away and never return.

...

After a quarter-hour, the madam folded the letter.

Looking at Lin Shan, she simply said, "I can grant you one request within my power, as thanks for this."

Lin Shan's head snapped up. "Any request?"

The madam remained calm. "Within reason."

Hesitantly, Lin Shan asked, "Could I have the brothel's current top courtesan?"

The madam's anger flared. "Is that all you aspire to?"

Lin Shan mumbled, "If not... maybe some spirit stones?"

"I can arrange for you to join a major cultivation sect."

Lin Shan brightened. "Purple Mist Sect? Dry Cloud Pavilion? Or Beast Taming Valley?"

The madam smiled eerily, her eyes glinting with cruelty. "Neither. A great demonic sect!"

Lin Shan: "I'll take my leave!"

"You haven't even heard which one!"

"My duty to Brother Huang is done. I seek no reward—farewell!"

Lin Shan bolted like a startled hare, not looking back until he was safely outside. Only then did he relax slightly, hearing a faint voice carried by the wind—for his ears alone:

"Should you change your mind, come find me at Yanchun Tower. I'll send you to the Black Lotus Sect..."

...

Walking back to his inn, Lin Shan shuddered at the memory. The madam's "offer" had been no choice at all. That suffocating pressure was something he never wanted to experience again.

Her strength far surpassed his—she could crush him like an ant. He'd never encountered such power up close and didn't know her exact cultivation level, but that murderous aura marked her as someone who killed without blinking.

Moreover, he'd failed to escort Immortal Huang safely—only delivering a letter after his death. This hardly constituted a great favor.

Her offer to join the Black Lotus Sect likely wasn't about repaying a debt but some ulterior motive—or just a casual move in a larger game.

As a mere mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator, joining a demonic sect would leave him vulnerable to internal strife or being casually eliminated by righteous cultivators like Thunderbolt Zhen.

With his enhancement panel, he could grow steadily as a rogue cultivator by collecting ancient aura—no need to risk a demonic sect.

Demonic cultivators were temperamental, engaging in blood sacrifices and infighting as routine. At his current level, it was best to stay away.

The night breeze cooled Lin Shan as he set aside this burden. Helping Immortal Huang had cost him four spirit stones with no gain—nearly getting himself killed too.

He resolved to avoid Yichuan's brothels unless necessary, lest the madam take a sudden interest in recruiting him.

Then again... if he joined the Black Lotus Sect, wouldn't their Buddha statues provide endless ancient aura?

A saying came to mind: *A mouse in a granary never goes hungry.*

"Hmm..."

"Perhaps the Black Lotus Sect isn't completely out of the question..."

"Once my strength improves... maybe?"

The cold wind swirled down the street before vanishing into the night.
