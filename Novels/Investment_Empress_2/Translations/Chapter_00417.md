# Chapter 417: Ying Huang, A New Ranking Begins!

Even within the infinite mysteries of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain, Her figure remained a conspicuously existent presence.

Ying Bing currently felt as she had when the Taiyin power within her first erupted.

An endless, cold Yin energy seemed to surge from the depths of her soul, spreading throughout her entire body, rendering her unable to even move a single finger.

It felt as though she were plummeting endlessly into an icy abyss...

She seemed to have become a mere observer of herself, powerless to do anything.

"You have come."

Was that sound carried by the wind?

It was identical to what she had heard in the underground palace.

So.

The one calling out to her within the Yunmeng Palace was not the Yunmeng Ancestor Deity at all...

It was Her!

The moment this thought arose, Ying Bing felt her consciousness sinking into chaos.

*Hum—*

*Hum—*

It was as if the heart of the heavens and earth was beating. The calling sound suddenly became deafening, as if speaking to her.

The murmurs seemed to be in no human language; perhaps mortals did not even possess the qualification to comprehend their meaning.

"She... wants to take my consciousness?"

"Even if it means mutual destruction..."

Ying Bing maintained her consciousness from dispersing. Facing an existence as vast as the heavens, she was indeed like a mere ant. But she would never allow herself to do nothing.

Time seemed to lose its meaning.

Suddenly, her vision cleared. In the void, she saw the familiar osmanthus palace, but the woman sitting within was not her.

Nine-colored Primordial Phoenix.

Her face was indistinct, but her aura—like a deep, still river, compassionate and pitying the world—was irreplaceable.

"You... want to replace me?"

Ying Bing subconsciously reached out, but she could not grasp her sword.

"The me of now will not, but the me of the future, perhaps..." The gentle woman's voice was as soft as a flowing stream.

Ying Bing said coldly, "Who exactly are you?"

"My name... my name..."

The gentle woman paused, seemingly lost in memory.

The surrounding void seemed to fluctuate violently with the turbulence of her thoughts.

After a long while, her voice rang out again:

"I am Ying Huang."

"This is a trace of consciousness I left behind in the Heavenly Phoenix Domain while deducing the future of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths."

Ying Huang's gaze became gentle.

Using the Heavenly Phoenix Domain to deduce the future of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths?

In her previous life, Ying Bing had controlled half of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain in the Realm of the Heavenly Human City. Only today did she learn that this divine object had such an origin.

The Nine-colored Primordial Phoenix was Ying Huang.

After leading the Nine Immortals to save the world, worried that the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths might collapse again for other reasons in the future, she continuously deduced the future of this world...

Just what kind of unfathomable power did she possess after returning from the Heavenly Realm?

Ying Bing remained silent.

Unless she successfully ascended the Immortal Path, this feat was impossible to achieve.

Ying Huang poured a cup of tea and gently pushed it over:

"You should know of the game on the烂柯山 (Broken Axe Mountain)."

"Yes."

Ying Bing nodded.

"The situation of that game is the result of my deduction of the future of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, manifested through the game, but it is incomplete."

"The fact that you can see me means you possess the qualification to break the game."

"Then please, go and take the other half of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain."

The gentle woman, who called herself Ying Huang, said seriously.

"..."

Ying Bing pondered silently, like a jade sculpture amidst frost and snow.

In her past life, she possessed only half of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain, yet her Inner Scene Field was already invincible in the current world, let alone the complete domain.

But she did not know what this ancestor of the Ying family, the savior of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, intended to do.

Is she an enemy or a friend?

Or does she have other intentions?

Ying Huang let out a soft sigh:

"I cannot answer your doubts."

"Then why me? Is it merely because... I am of the Ying bloodline?"

---

Ying Bing was certain this was the first time this entity had appeared.

"You and I are the same," Ying Huang said.

"In what way?"

Ying Huang lowered her eyes slightly, as if she were the center of the world:

"My heart tells me so, but I do not know the root cause."

"I will go and take the other half of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain."

Ying Bing paused for a moment, then said seriously, "But I do not want to become you, nor do I want to become anyone else. I... only want to be myself."

"Otherwise, I would rather perish."

Her tone was like shattering ice falling to the ground.

The "Ice Cube" was being completely serious.

"Then you must surpass the future me, and surpass yourself."

The gentle woman, Ying Huang, seemed to be smiling softly:

"Learn from me, and you live."

"Imitate me... and you die."

At the moment these words appeared, the colors of the surrounding world began to fade. Everything was retreating rapidly, and the real world descended.

Ying Bing slowly opened her eyes.

She found that everything was as it had been before. The steam from the hot pot downstairs was still rising, blurring the outline of the Clear Abyss Sect.

If not for the fact that the incomplete Heavenly Phoenix Domain now fully belonged to her, the experience just now would have been like a dream.

Ying Bing walked to the bronze mirror by her bedside. Her reflection appeared in the mirror—elegant and cold, as beautiful as a celestial being, yet faintly carrying a sickly weariness.

Perhaps the exchange just now had consumed much of her spiritual soul.

"Surpass Her, surpass myself..."

"I will!"

Ying Bing rubbed the head of the big-headed doll at her waist, whispering to herself.

As if sensing her thoughts, the system's text appeared again:

[Host, would you like to start a new ranking...]

Its words had not yet finished transmitting.

Ying Bing's thought had already fallen without hesitation.

Yes.

[If only the Host were this proactive every time...]

[Initiating the current Peerless Genius Ranking.]

[Ranking Scope: Imperial Capital.]

[Punishment for the losers this time: Planting forty-nine strawberries on the winner.]

"Imperial Capital..."

Ying Bing had expected this, but she still fell into thought.

By the calculation of days, the next ranking release date coincides with the gathering of the Hidden Dragon geniuses in the Imperial Capital.

If she wants to be the champion, she must stand out from all the geniuses of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths.

Also.

In this process, she cannot have any worries.

"There might be other ways to prevent the other consciousnesses within me from awakening..."

"I'll ask Qin Yuzhi about this later."

......

After dinner, Li Mo also returned to his room.

Now was not the time for dual cultivation, but rather...

The lottery draw segment!

Little Li rubbed his hands together, feeling a bit excited.

When he left the Broken Axe Mountain, a large wave of investment feedback notifications had sounded again, coming from the various forces and martial artists who had escaped.

Of course!

There was also the Ice Cube's!

"Old rule, let's start with the ones with ordinary Fate."

Li Mo began to collect the investment feedback with a sense of ritual.

.......

PS: This large segment of the plot really exhausted this little author. Fortunately, in the end, the things I wanted to write were all expressed. Some parts are quite implicit, but overall, I am satisfied. I also deeply realized...

Well, this little author actually still likes writing sweet scenes.

Writing foreshadowing is really tiring; it's better to integrate it into daily life.

Please support with likes, this little author has gotten thinner writing this segment, so please feed this piggy, hehe~
