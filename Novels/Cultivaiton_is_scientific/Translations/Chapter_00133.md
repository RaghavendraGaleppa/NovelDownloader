# Chapter 133: Intermediate Level

In his third year within the sect, Li Shiming's spiritual energy had doubled in volume. He had reached the fifth level of Qi Refining, placing him firmly in the intermediate ranks of Qi Refining cultivators.

The third-grade metal he had been cultivating with the "Sword Demon Secret Codex" had been completely absorbed by his body over the past six months. Although the metal was fully assimilated, he was still far from reaching the first stage of the "Sword Demon Secret Codex," which represented the peak of Qi Refining.

However, his cultivation speed had significantly improved. As the third-grade metal circulated through his body, reinforcing it, it also enhanced his ability to absorb and convert spiritual energy. His cultivation speed was now on par with that of a typical dual-spiritual-root cultivator, explaining how he had advanced to the fifth level of Qi Refining in just six months.

His "Vajra Body Protection Divine Art" had reached the limit of his current realm. He felt that his physical body alone could now rival a seventh-level Qi Refining Copper Corpse. His defenses were such that even mid-grade offensive magical tools would struggle to penetrate.

In terms of offense, his Copper Corpse had reached the peak of its potential, equivalent to a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator, thanks to the ghostly environment created by the "Netherworld Ghost Domain Formation." Despite the additional burden of two extra heads and four arms, the Copper Corpse's progress hadn't been hindered. The third-grade spiritual materials used in the formation had provided immense benefits.

His "Sword Control Art" had also seen significant improvements. He had upgraded to a top-tier metal-attribute sword called "Jade-Breaking Sword," which was among the finest high-grade magical tools available. A slight further enhancement would elevate it to a super-grade magical tool. With this sword and six months of dedicated practice, his mastery of the "Sword Control Art" had deepened, greatly increasing its potency.

Super-grade magical tools were exceedingly rare among Qi Refining cultivators, primarily because they required vast amounts of spiritual energy to wield. Only those at the ninth level of Qi Refining could typically handle them, and most ninth-level cultivators were either undertaking dangerous missions to earn merit points or spirit stones for Foundation Establishment Pills or were in seclusion attempting breakthroughs.

Li Shiming had rarely encountered ninth-level Qi Refining cultivators during his three years in the sect. His spiritual sense had also strengthened. The spiritual sense jade sword he cultivated had seen notable improvements in range and power after he advanced to the fourth level of Qi Refining.

The main soul of his "Spirit Control Soul-Splitting Technique" had transformed into a complete soul entity after devouring numerous souls six months prior. If not for its ethereal nature, it would be nearly indistinguishable from a real person. Crucially, the technique had reached true mastery—an outcome he hadn't anticipated. From then on, the main soul no longer needed to consume other souls. After splitting off fragments, it could recover by absorbing energy from the surrounding environment.

In just six months, his strength had surged dramatically. Resource-wise, despite spending a significant portion of his spirit stones on various goods and formation knowledge through trades with the Yun Trading Company, he still retained 190,000 spirit stones. The profits from the "Thousand-Mile Mutual Vision" devices were substantial, even after increased expenditures.

Additionally, he had sold over 10,000 sea beast carcasses through various identities over six months, netting a staggering 2.4 million spirit stones. Upon learning the true market value of these carcasses, he realized he couldn't fully trust the Yun Trading Company. His caution proved justified—the company, having gained a commercial edge with the "Thousand-Mile Mutual Vision," no longer prioritized him, especially given his weak cultivation and junior formation master status. Fair cooperation only existed between equals.

The Yun Trading Company hadn't overtly targeted him but had engaged in minor underhanded dealings, knowing he possessed nearly 200,000 spirit stones—a tempting target for exploitation.

In his underground space, Li Shiming had focused more on cultivation than technological replication over the past six months. The increasing difficulty in procuring materials from the Yun Trading Company had frustrated him. Seeking a new protective talisman to shield himself from the company's retaliation, he decided to take the intermediate formation master examination—a suggestion Yun Shilan had made repeatedly.

Within the sect, intermediate formation masters were the backbone of the formation division. Even without her father's influence, Yun Shilan held considerable status as one. Moreover, Li Shiming needed a new business partner to procure materials.

Retrieving a new model of the "Thousand-Mile Mutual Vision"—dubbed "Thousand-Mile Mutual Vision II"—from his machinery, Li Shiming stored it in his storage bag and departed Eagle Beak Island. Flapping his wings, he flew toward the Nine Peaks, heading first to Exchange Peak. Before leaving, he had submitted an application for the intermediate formation master examination to the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion.

Upon arrival, he was greeted by two Foundation Establishment uncles, including the familiar Uncle Zhuge, and five late-stage Qi Refining cultivators—all formation masters.

"Greetings, Uncles and Senior Brothers," Li Shiming bowed respectfully.

"Finally here for certification?" Uncle Zhuge smiled knowingly, hinting that Yun Shilan might have shared information about Li Shiming's achievements.

Certification differed from examination—it was a formality without tests, whereas examinations required passing sect-assigned tasks. The presence of two Foundation Establishment seniors, both advanced formation masters, was due to Yun Shilan's revelation that Li Shiming had condensed a "Starlight Sea of Formations"—a hallmark of advanced formation mastery potential.

"Uncle Zhuge, I'm here for the examination," Li Shiming clarified softly.

"Just display your Starlight Sea. Uncle Chang is busy and made time for this," Uncle Zhuge waved off further explanation.

Realizing Yun Shilan had disclosed his Starlight Sea, Li Shiming didn't blame her. She had repeatedly urged him to apply for intermediate formation master status so they could undertake missions together. Revealing his Starlight Sea to the elders of Exchange Peak only brought benefits, ensuring greater protection.

Focusing inward, Li Shiming summoned his Starlight Sea, and a dazzling array of starlight appeared above his head. The assembled masters observed silently, each Starlight Sea being unique, reflecting the individual's knowledge and comprehension of formations.

The five senior brothers—intermediate formation masters without Starlight Seas—had been invited to witness this rare spectacle, hoping to glean insights for their own advancement. The two uncles, however, were impressed by the brilliance of Li Shiming's Starlight Sea, a sign of profound understanding rare in newly condensed formations.

"Li Shiming, Uncle Chang and I certify you as an intermediate formation master," Uncle Zhuge announced solemnly, updating Li Shiming's identity jade slip.

"Your formation system lacks sect knowledge. From now on, you'll have unrestricted access to intermediate-level sect formations without spending merit points," Uncle Chang added.

Li Shiming was elated—this would save him countless merit points. While he had ample spirit stones, merit points were hard-earned, and formation knowledge was expensive.

"Thank you, Uncles," he bowed gratefully.

"The sect provides intermediate formation masters with the best treatment: 2,000 spirit stones monthly, plus an equivalent value in formation materials. But in return, you must serve the sect and can no longer act as you please," Uncle Zhuge reminded sternly.

Li Shiming's expression fell. His packed schedule—filled with cultivation and research—left little room for additional duties.

"You're not being tied down. The sect's grand formation needs maintenance, and nodes across the territory require inspection. All intermediate formation masters share this responsibility," Uncle Zhuge chided, displeased with his reluctance.

"Understood. I'll complete any assigned tasks," Li Shiming acquiesced, realizing the opportunity to study the sect's grand formation up close—a privilege previously beyond his reach.

Uncle Zhuge sighed. Normally, such attitudes would disqualify candidates, but Li Shiming's potential and clean background—born in the sect's controlled region, recruited through the Ascension Assembly, with no ties to rogue cultivators—made him a rare talent worth nurturing.

"Additionally, you now have limited access to the sect's grand formation. Use this privilege wisely," Uncle Zhuge concluded, dismissing him.

Exiting the pavilion, Li Shiming eagerly checked his jade slip to review his new permissions. Within the Nine Peaks, his access was mostly unchanged, granting temporary entry to formations during maintenance tasks. However, outside the sect, he could activate hundreds of nodes spanning a thousand li, each capable of providing protection equivalent to a short-term defense against Foundation Establishment attacks—a testament to the sect's investment in him.

Beyond the monthly 4,000-spirit-stone stipend (2,000 in stones, 2,000 in materials) and free knowledge access, the sect's support aimed to cultivate him into an advanced formation master. Unlike regular cultivators, who only gained attention at Foundation Establishment, formation masters were valued for their long-term contributions, even if their cultivation stalled at Qi Refining.
