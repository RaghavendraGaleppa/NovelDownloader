# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 114: News of Qin Yan (Seeking Recommendation Votes)  

"Senior has heard of my junior sister?"  

"Mmm." Lin Xuan's thoughts drifted to that slender, graceful figure and the tender century-long promise they had made. His heart swirled with mixed emotions—a hint of joy, a touch of melancholy, and a trace of uncertainty.  

"Senior? Senior?"  

"Ah!" Lin Xuan snapped out of his reverie. Though Ma Tianxiong found his behavior odd, he couldn't possibly guess the romantic entanglement between Lin Xuan and Qin Yan and dared not pry further, keeping his questions to himself.  

Lin Xuan cleared his throat. "Continue. Where were we? Ah, yes—the rapid downfall of the Fire Spirit Sect was related to the Cloudsoar Fairy."  

"Indeed!" Speaking of his sect's pride, Ma Tianxiong's eyebrows lifted. "At the time, Junior Sister Qin was only at the peak of the Qi Refining stage. She was sent by the sect leader to gather a spiritual herb at Xiyue Gorge when she witnessed the Fire Spirit Sect's atrocities, slaughtering fellow cultivators without mercy..."  

Despite his burly and rough appearance, Ma Tianxiong had a talent for storytelling. Though Lin Xuan had personally experienced the events at Xiyue Gorge, hearing them recounted still sent a thrill down his spine.  

A faint smile tugged at Lin Xuan's lips. If this man weren't a cultivator, he’d have made an excellent storyteller.  

"Junior Sister Qin used a Palm Thunder Talisman to slay a Foundation Establishment cultivator but then drew the attention of the even more terrifying Fire Spirit Sect Leader..."  

The first half of the story matched what Lin Xuan already knew, but when it came to the confrontation with the Fire Spirit Sect Leader, it was altered to depict Qin Yan facing him alone.  

Hearing this, Lin Xuan sighed in relief. Though he knew Qin Yan had sworn a Heart Demon Oath and made a century-long vow with him, ensuring she wouldn’t betray him, it was still reassuring to hear she had indeed kept his involvement a secret.  

This gentle and intelligent woman, blessed with exceptional spiritual roots, had woven her tale flawlessly, omitting Lin Xuan's role without leaving a single inconsistency.  

"Though the Fire Spirit Sect Leader was at late Foundation Establishment, he suffered from a hidden ailment and couldn’t use his spiritual artifacts. Combined with his underestimation of her, he ultimately fell to Junior Sister Qin’s hands. Without their leader, the Fire Spirit Sect was left headless, leading to their swift defeat."  

"But I heard the Fire Spirit Sect had a Core Formation expert. Why didn’t he step in to take charge?"  

"Senior may not know this," Ma Tianxiong said, taking a sip of tea—his throat dry from speaking so much. "You must be referring to that lecherous Elder Li. While he was indeed at the Core Formation stage, aside from his formidable strength, he lacked the ability to manage or lead. In fact, even the late Qingling Zhenren, in terms of pure cultivation, wasn’t among the top five in the Fire Spirit Sect..."  

Lin Xuan nodded thoughtfully. This made sense. In many sects, the leader wasn’t necessarily the strongest. A sect leader needed the virtue and talent to command respect, unify fellow disciples, and expand the sect’s influence—management skills mattered more than raw power. A leader wasn’t just a mere enforcer.  

Cases like the Cloud Crane Zhenren of the Drifting Cloud Valley—who was both the sect leader and its strongest cultivator—were rare. Even among the three major powers of Youzhou, where Nascent Soul cultivators existed, the sect leaders were merely early Core Formation cultivators.  

"What happened afterward?"  

"What else? After the Fire Spirit Sect collapsed, most of its disciples were killed, and the majority of its experts perished. Only a handful of lucky and truly skilled members managed to escape, including that Core Formation Elder Li."  

"Did the other sects not pursue them?"  

"Of course we did! We understand the danger of letting tigers return to the mountains. The sects of Youzhou jointly issued a manhunt, but those who escaped were cunning—none have been found yet." Ma Tianxiong sounded frustrated.  

Lin Xuan’s mood also darkened. His trip to Xiyue Gorge had not only yielded spiritual herbs but also two extraordinary treasures.  

One was an incredibly profound cultivation technique—the "Nine Heavens Profound Art"—which he had already begun practicing. Though he had only scratched the surface, its power was undeniable.  

The other was an ancient jade pendant carved with mysterious patterns. Yet, despite his prolonged study, he still couldn’t decipher its secrets. The Fire Spirit Sect had been willing to become public enemy number one for this treasure, so they must have known its purpose. Hearing the sect had disbanded, Lin Xuan had hoped to capture a high-ranking member for interrogation, but now...  

He suppressed his disappointment. His current priority was obtaining discarded pills—this matter could wait.  

"With the Fire Spirit Sect gone, I assume Yanzhou’s situation has stabilized?"  

"Of course!" Ma Tianxiong puffed up with pride. "Now, our Drifting Cloud Valley stands unrivaled, commanding the respect of all."  

"Is that so?" Lin Xuan replied indifferently.  

Noticing Lin Xuan’s skepticism, Ma Tianxiong sobered up, realizing he had gotten carried away. He quickly adopted a humble expression. "Forgive my presumption, Senior. Though our sect holds some influence in Yanzhou, we are nowhere near the level of Youzhou’s sects..."  

He sighed. Having traveled thousands of miles to the Spirit Medicine Mountain for alchemy, he had realized how narrow his worldview had been. The cultivation standards in Youzhou were an entire tier above Yanzhou’s. If the Drifting Cloud Valley were placed here, it would barely rank as a second-rate sect.  

"You flatter me." Lin Xuan had no interest in such matters. Having learned of Yanzhou’s situation, he feigned casualness and asked, "Your sect’s Cloudsoar Fairy must have received many rewards for such a great achievement."  

"Absolutely!"  

Ma Tianxiong’s face was full of envy. "The Cloud Crane Zhenren has already named Junior Sister Qin as the sect’s provisional successor."  

"What?" Lin Xuan’s hand trembled, spilling his tea. Even with his composure, he couldn’t hide his shock.
