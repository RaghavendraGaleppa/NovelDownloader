# Chapter 7: Traces of Demonic Cultivators  

After finishing his daily tasks and on his way back to his residence, Wei Qian encountered Li Guchen hurrying along the path.  

"What's the matter? Why the rush?" Wei Qian asked.  

Li Guchen replied, "There's trouble!"  

Wei Qian's steps faltered, and his expression turned grave.  

"What kind of trouble?"  

Li Guchen hesitated for a moment, then decided it was safe to share. "Just now, two senior cultivators from the 'Floating Cloud Sect' came to inform us that a group of demonic cultivators has been spotted in the area. They warned our Li Clan to be vigilant and report any traces of demonic activity to the sect immediately."  

"I'm on my way to notify the Li Clan members outside the mountain to return to Mist Ridge as soon as possible."  

"By the way, Brother Wei, keep this to yourself—don't spread it around," Li Guchen added.  

Wei Qian nodded. "I understand."  

With that, Li Guchen hurried down the mountain.  

When Wei Qian returned to his residence, he found Fu Bo waiting for him. The old man warned him that the outside world had become unsafe and advised him to stay put.  

Though Wei Qian already knew the reason from Li Guchen, he still clasped his hands in gratitude toward Fu Bo. The old man declined Wei Qian's invitation to come inside and quickly took his leave.  

Once inside, Wei Qian had barely sat down when he sensed a faint disturbance in the spiritual energy around him. It felt similar to when the mountain's protective formation had been activated during the trade fair, though much weaker this time.  

"Probably just the formation running at a low-power setting," Wei Qian mused.  

Having read many miscellaneous cultivation texts, he knew formations had two states: preliminary activation and full operation. Running at full power consumed an astronomical amount of spirit stones, making it unsustainable for long periods.  

Most cultivation clans kept their formations in an autonomous standby mode, only activating them fully when external threats triggered a response. But now, the Li Clan had clearly taken the initiative to activate it preemptively, albeit at a controlled intensity to minimize resource consumption.  

"This group of demonic cultivators must be truly dangerous. Otherwise, the Li Clan wouldn't react so strongly," Wei Qian thought, tapping his fingers restlessly on the table.  

"It's strange, though. Where did demonic cultivators even come from in the Zhao Kingdom's cultivation world?"  

During his time as a rogue cultivator, he had only heard one rumor about demonic practitioners—an incident where someone discovered the ruins of an ancient demonic cultivator's cave, which had caused quite a stir.  

###  

Indeed, demonic cultivators in the Zhao Kingdom had been unheard of for nearly a thousand years.  

Back then, a demonic force from the north had launched a massive invasion, conquering several southern kingdoms. Demonic sects and rogue cultivators within Zhao and neighboring countries saw this as their chance to rise, acting as collaborators and guides for the invaders.  

However, Zhao and its allies united to repel the northern forces, pushing the battle lines back. The war raged for a century before both sides finally signed a millennium-long peace treaty in the Kingdom of Yan.  

Afterward, all demonic sects and practitioners within Zhao were purged, leading to their near-extinction over the next thousand years.  

The reason for the word "near"? Because now, traces of demonic cultivators had reappeared.  

"The millennium treaty still has a hundred years left. Could the demonic forces be preparing a century in advance?"  

On Earth, such long-term schemes spanning centuries would be nearly impossible to execute—after all, "policies die with their makers." But in this world, high-level cultivators lived far beyond mortal lifespans.  

Qi Refining cultivators had lifespans no different from ordinary people. Foundation Establishment experts lived between two to three hundred years. Golden Core ancestors could reach five to six hundred years, while Nascent Soul elders enjoyed lifespans of a full millennium!  

If such beings were behind this, planning a century ahead made perfect sense.  

"Then again, there's the simplest explanation—these demonic cultivators are just rogue elements who wandered into Zhao Kingdom, with no grand scheme at all."  

Wei Qian hoped this was the case.  

He had barely spent a year at Mist Ridge's Li Clan, just beginning to enjoy a stable life. Was it all about to end so soon?  

"They say wherever a protagonist goes, chaos follows. I don't have that kind of protagonist's luck—or misfortune—so I probably won't get caught up in something as dire as a demonic invasion," Wei Qian reassured himself.  

###  

For seven days, Mist Ridge's protective formation hummed at low power before finally deactivating.  

Wei Qian, who had been using his "Golden Grass-Cutting Sword" technique to clear weeds and pests from the spirit rice fields, suddenly straightened up.  

Something had changed—but whether for better or worse, he didn't yet know.  

A streak of light descended from the sky, landing atop the mountain's grand hall.  

Before long, good news spread throughout the clan.  

The Li Clan's patriarch announced a three-day grand celebration!  

By the time Wei Qian heard the news, he already saw groups of mortals under Fu Bo's direction decorating the area with lanterns and banners.  

###  

Among the gathered Li Clan cultivators, Wei Qian spotted two familiar figures—Li Caiwei, the clan's young mistress, and Li Guchen.  

After a moment's thought, he approached Li Guchen for details.  

"Oh, you're asking about that?" Li Guchen, already tipsy from earlier celebrations, grinned and leaned in conspiratorially. "Our clan answered the sect's call and sent a team led by the patriarch himself to join the hunt for those demonic cultivators!"  

Wei Qian offered a subtle compliment. "They must have accomplished something remarkable."  

Li Guchen laughed heartily. "Of course! The sect's rewards are generous this time. The patriarch even promised to distribute treasures among our Li Clan disciples!"  

Realizing Wei Qian was an outsider, Li Guchen sobered slightly, but before he could say more, Wei Qian patted his shoulder and sent him back to the festivities.  

Though Li Guchen worried his words might have created distance between them, Wei Qian truly didn't mind.  

The achievements had nothing to do with him, so it was only natural he wouldn't receive any rewards.  

With the demonic cultivators eliminated, previously restricted information became widely known, allowing Wei Qian to piece together the full story.  

Contrary to his fears of a large-scale demonic invasion, this group had merely come to Zhao Kingdom to excavate a secret realm. Poor security measures led to a leak, drawing the attention—and wrath—of the Golden Core-level Floating Cloud Sect.  

Now, all the demonic cultivators had been eradicated.  

To celebrate the united efforts of the region's cultivation clans in the operation, the Floating Cloud Sect and the Xiao Clan—one of Zhao Kingdom's five great cultivation families—would jointly host an auction in a month's time.  

Rare treasures typically unseen by ordinary cultivators would be up for bidding.
