# Chapter 22: Diligent Cultivation  

After completing his preparations, Lin Xuan lay down to rest and gather his strength for the upcoming cultivation.  

In the following days, Lin Xuan didn’t immediately begin purifying the discarded pills. Instead, he decided to observe quietly for a while. Although Zhao Ming had given him a detailed introduction to the situation here, he still needed to verify for himself whether everything was truly as described and free of deception.  

Moreover, the cultivators who applied to work here as overseers were typically lazy individuals unwilling to put in the effort for rigorous cultivation. If he appeared too diligent, wouldn’t that arouse suspicion?  

Since the path of cultivation was long, there was no need to rush. Thus, Lin Xuan decided to spend some time discreetly assessing the situation while also cultivating an image among the young attendants of being lazy, reclusive, and fond of shutting himself in his room undisturbed.  

Once everyone had grown accustomed to this facade, no one would suspect him when he later purified pills and cultivated diligently in his room.  

With this plan in mind, Lin Xuan began acting accordingly over the next few days.  

After about a week of quiet observation, he confirmed that Zhao Ming hadn’t lied. The workload in the Discarded Pills Repository was indeed light—almost nonexistent. Aside from the first day of each month, when attendants from the Alchemy Pavilion delivered failed pills, no one—not even outer sect disciples—visited the place.  

It was an isolated and idle post, but for Lin Xuan, it was perfect.  

The disarray in the management of the discarded pills was also as Zhao Ming had described—if not worse. Rumor had it that records had been kept a thousand years ago, but now... no one knew where they had ended up.  

In short, the entire room was filled with discarded pills accumulated over the centuries, with no one knowing the exact number. For Lin Xuan, it was a treasure trove he could freely plunder.  

The only regret was that the pills available were limited to the Body Cleansing Pills used during the Spirit Condensation Stage. But his need for higher-tier pills was still far off, so he set that thought aside for now.  

Having assessed the situation, Lin Xuan spent another half-month successfully establishing his false image among the attendants.  

By now, everyone in the Discarded Pills Repository knew that their new overseer was lazy, fond of sleeping, and reclusive, preferring to shut himself in his room alone.  

The attendants also noticed the barrier Lin Xuan had set up outside his living quarters, but they didn’t find it strange. In fact, they privately assumed that the overseer had set up the formation to prevent anyone from disturbing his naps.  

With this understanding, of course, no fool would dare provoke his displeasure. People avoided the area within ten meters of Lin Xuan’s quarters, and all miscellaneous tasks continued to be handled by Zhao Ming.  

This was precisely the result Lin Xuan desired. Now, he could focus wholeheartedly on his cultivation plan.  

First, he openly took a bottle of discarded pills from the repository and returned to his room to begin purification.  

Of course, before that, he also prepared some steamed buns and dried meat as food—low-level cultivators at the Spirit Condensation Stage couldn’t yet abstain from eating.  

Over the next two days, Lin Xuan purified all the pills in the bottle. Thanks to his previous research and practice, he was now very familiar with purifying low-grade Body Cleansing Pills. The process went smoothly, and his success rate had improved further—out of a hundred discarded pills, he obtained thirty-six usable ones.  

His speed had also increased, a benefit of reaching the second layer of the Spirit Condensation Stage, which had expanded the volume of his internal starry sea.  

With the purified pills in hand, Lin Xuan began consuming them for cultivation. Following the maximum dosage recorded in ancient texts and his own insights, he took three pills three times a day—morning, noon, and night.  

Driven by the potent medicinal effects and his relentless effort, his cultivation progressed rapidly despite his lack of spiritual roots.  

Once he exhausted his supply of Body Cleansing Pills, Lin Xuan would simply retrieve more discarded pills, purify them, and continue his cultivation.  

This cycle repeated endlessly.

Time flowed like water, and before he knew it, half a year had passed.  

Lin Xuan continued cultivating diligently in the Discarded Pills Repository. He no longer visited the Path of Tempered Will, even though the spiritual energy there was richer and he wasn’t afraid of hardship. There was simply no need—with the massive daily consumption of Body Cleansing Pills, the difference in spiritual energy density no longer affected his progress.  

However, Lin Xuan didn’t isolate himself completely. Every few days, he would visit the Young Eagle Pavilion.  

According to the rules of the Drifting Cloud Sect, a Foundation Establishment expert would periodically give lectures to Spirit Condensation disciples. Lin Xuan naturally wouldn’t miss such opportunities to learn.  

Even if some techniques weren’t immediately useful, he listened attentively and recorded the methods for future reference.  

Over the past six months, Lin Xuan had consumed thousands of Body Cleansing Pills. Under the influence of the potent medicinal effects and his own relentless effort, his cultivation had advanced to the fourth layer—the peak of the mid-stage Spirit Condensation realm.  

Among the disciples who had entered the sect at the same time as him, Lin Xuan’s current level placed him in the upper-middle tier. Aside from a few prodigies with exceptional spiritual roots who had reached the fifth layer, most disciples were still lingering at the third.  

In other words, Lin Xuan had surpassed the majority.  

Half a year ago, he had only been at the first layer of the Spirit Condensation Stage. Yet in just a few months, he had leaped three layers. Such speed wasn’t entirely unheard of in the cultivation world, but it was exceedingly rare—typically seen only in once-in-a-century geniuses. And Lin Xuan was merely an ordinary person without spiritual roots.  

The pills played a role, of course. Aside from him, with his unique purification ability, even the wealthiest orthodox sects or demonic overlords couldn’t afford to let their disciples consume precious pills like candy.  

The second factor was his effort. Lin Xuan understood that rewards came only after hard work. Even with his purification ability, he never slacked off. In fact, his training had become even more intense.  

Heaven rewards the diligent. Yet Lin Xuan wasn’t blinded by his current achievements. He remained a low-level cultivator with secrets he couldn’t afford to reveal. Thus, he kept a low profile within the sect, avoiding attention while quietly cultivating in private.
