# Chapter 16: Inventory

Li Shiming left the guest courtyard and returned to his own residence, where he found Siqin sitting on the small bed by the outer door, arms folded, eyes half-closed as her head nodded drowsily.

At the sound of his arrival, Siqin immediately snapped awake.

"Young master, you're finally back—ugh, what's that smell!" Siqin exclaimed as she hurriedly got up from the bed, only to recoil at the odor emanating from Li Shiming.

"Quickly prepare hot water!" Li Shiming waved his hand dismissively.

"I wonder what the young master has been up to!" she grumbled under her breath, but her hands and feet moved swiftly as she dashed out.

Before long, a large tub of hot water was ready. Li Shiming soaked in it, watching as the grime washed away, revealing skin that had become even more delicate. He recalled the appearance of the two cultivators he had met—his skin now bore a similar quality to theirs.

The troubles of Nanling City were no concern of his. After three days of practicing the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique," the spiritual energy vortex in his chest had completely stabilized.

During these three days of cultivation, he noticed that the four glowing stones on the Gathering Spirit Plate had dimmed slightly. This subtle change was only detectable because of the heightened perception within the Machine Room Space. When the plate was stored there, his consciousness could discern even the slightest variations.

He concluded that the four glowing stones on the Gathering Spirit Plate were being consumed. As long as the plate remained active, the stones would continue to diminish. He didn't know how to deactivate the plate, nor did he dare attempt to remove the stones forcibly. For now, he could still rely on the plate for cultivation. If he damaged it, his progress would be severely hindered.

He had tried cultivating without the plate and found that the ambient spiritual energy points were pitifully few. Without the Gathering Spirit Plate, it would take him a hundred times longer to reach the second level of Qi Refining.

Using the computational power of the IBM z15 mainframe, Li Shiming estimated that the plate had about twenty-five days of usable energy left. He needed to maximize its utility during this time.

Another discovery he made was that the spiritual energy gathered by the plate in the Machine Room Space continuously increased the ambient energy concentration there. He could even draw this energy out to aid his cultivation. With this in mind, he kept the plate in the Machine Room Space whenever he wasn't practicing the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique," ensuring no energy was wasted.

He also took the time to leave the city and dispose of Chief Escort Wang's body, clearing out the Machine Room Space.

Since reaching the first level of Qi Refining, Li Shiming found that his ability to manipulate the generator with his consciousness had doubled. He could now sustain this for two hours, and the duration was still increasing.

That evening, he retrieved Shi Ximing's storage pouch from the Machine Room Space. Ever since the spiritual energy vortex had formed in his chest, he had been contemplating how to open it.

The concept of spatial storage was purely fantastical in his previous life—there wasn't even a theoretical foundation for such research. Although he had the Machine Room Space, which functioned similarly, this was a cultivator's storage pouch, containing items of immense value to him.

Moreover, if his storage ability were discovered, he couldn't risk exposing the Machine Room Space. Storage pouches might be rare in the mortal world, but since nearly every cultivator carried one, they were likely commonplace in the cultivation world. Revealing the pouch would be far less risky.

Li Shiming attempted to channel spiritual energy from his chest to his right hand. A wisp of energy obediently flowed from the vortex to his palm. When he pressed his hand against the pouch, something miraculous happened—he sensed a spatial pocket, within which every item was perceptible to him.

A hoe, a rake, a shovel, and two coarse cloth bags.

If not for the thousand taels of gold, a small mountain of silver, a white robe, a longsword, and five books he also sensed, he might have thought he'd stumbled upon a farmer's belongings.

But he didn't underestimate these items. The hoe, rake, and shovel were all imbued with spiritual energy. Though their energy was far weaker than that of the longsword, their very nature as spiritual tools marked them as cultivation artifacts.

The two cloth bags contained unhulled rice grains, each exuding a gentle spiritual energy. The longsword and white robe shared similar energy levels, suggesting they were of comparable quality.

Li Shiming compared them to the small wooden sword he had taken from Chief Escort Wang. Despite its diminutive size—too small to wield—the wooden sword's spiritual energy far surpassed that of the longsword and robe, indicating its superior quality.

Without a detailed framework for judging cultivation artifacts, he could only rely on the density of spiritual energy as a rough measure.

He retrieved the five books—these were what he coveted most. Cultivation texts would deepen his understanding of this world.

"Spring Breeze and Rain Art," "Metal Severing Art," "Earth Spirit Art," "Spiritual Farmer's Basics," and a cultivation journal.

"Spiritual Farmer's Basics" documented the cultivation of spiritual rice, tea, herbs, flowers, and over twenty types of spiritual medicines he had never heard of. It covered everything from soil composition to seasonal considerations and troubleshooting—practically a step-by-step guide.

The text also mentioned "Spring Breeze and Rain Art," "Metal Severing Art," and "Earth Spirit Art" as foundational techniques every spiritual farmer must master. Each of these arts was detailed in its own booklet, with exhaustive explanations of every step in their execution.

Upon reading the cultivation journal, Li Shiming understood why Shi Ximing's storage pouch contained these items—he had been a spiritual farmer. The two bags of spiritual rice were his own harvest.

Tucked within the journal were twenty-three talismans: eleven "Primary Lightness Talismans" (which he recognized), two "Primary Earth Armor Talismans," five "Primary Fireball Talismans," and five "Primary Ice Arrow Talismans."

He held one of the Lightness Talismans, hesitating to use it. Until he formally entered the cultivation world, these talismans would serve as his trump cards.

Though he possessed "Beginner's Guide to Talisman Crafting," he lacked the materials to practice. Shi Ximing's journal was essentially a manual for becoming a spiritual farmer. Li Shiming's spiritual energy was still insufficient to learn the arts, let alone choose a cultivation profession. For now, the journal only broadened his knowledge—its practical value was limited.
