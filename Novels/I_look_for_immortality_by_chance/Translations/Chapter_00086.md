# Chapter 86: Flower Spirits and the Mystic Grass Banquet  

The stone steps were flanked by thick clouds and mist, with nothing else in sight.  

Yet within Gu Yuan's spiritual perception, four peculiar creatures appeared.  

These beings all resembled young girls, complete with limbs and features indistinguishable from humans—except they were tiny, no larger than an adult's thumb. Each had two small buns tied atop their heads and wore pink dresses, their bodies enveloped in a strange halo of light.  

This radiance concealed their forms, blending them seamlessly into the surroundings. Only those with extraordinary spiritual senses could detect them.  

Moreover, their communication wasn't through sound but rather an odd spiritual fluctuation that rippled through the air.  

They had concealed themselves perfectly, remaining unnoticed by all the cultivators who had passed by earlier.  

But now, in their perception, a silver-scaled flood dragon with gleaming armor and gaping jaws was prowling toward them, claws bared as if ready to devour them whole.  

"Wah!"  

"It really is supreme-grade spiritual sense! And a silver flood dragon at that!"  

"Run, run! Or we'll be eaten!"  

"Quick, tell the young mistress! A powerful one has arrived!"  

Terrified by the overwhelming spiritual pressure, the tiny creatures shrieked and clutched each other's hands, transforming into a streak of pink light that vanished into the mist in an instant.  

"Are those... flower spirits?"  

Watching the pink streak disappear, Gu Yuan frowned slightly.  

Flower spirits were mystical beings that only emerged from spiritual flowers over a thousand years old. Highly intelligent and long-lived, they were adorable in appearance. If nurtured alongside a cultivator, they could gradually enhance their master's innate talent and lifespan while growing stronger themselves.  

Moreover, they naturally harmonized with the world, their presence nearly undetectable. Only those with supreme-grade spiritual sense could perceive them, making them exceptional scouts.  

Only the most powerful aristocratic families and formidable figures could afford to keep them as spiritual attendants.  

Gu Yuan hadn't expected to encounter four of them before even entering Yunxuan Island—proof of the Bian family's profound heritage.  

"Truly befitting a top-tier family of the Dao Academy..."  

He marveled inwardly, though a question lingered: Why were these flower spirits hiding in the mist instead of staying with their Bian family masters? Were they spying on something?  

Recalling how his spiritual sense had been exposed, Gu Yuan grew wary.  

By then, the stone steps had ended, the mist parting to reveal a breathtaking vista. Moist air brushed against his face as a vast, mirror-like lake came into view.  

---  

The lake shimmered with countless rare and dazzling flowers, their brilliance competing for attention. Schools of azure fish, their heads crowned with horn-like protrusions and bodies resembling dragons, swam gracefully through the waters.  

On either shore, verdant mountains rose abruptly, ancient trees towering toward the sky, their lush greenery vibrant and alive. A colossal waterfall cascaded down, its waters tinged with rainbow hues as it crashed into the lake with a deafening roar.  

Thick spiritual energy danced joyously, visible as wisps of mist drifting between the mountains and the lake.  

With just one breath, Gu Yuan felt his body lighten, as if he could ride the wind and soar.  

This was a true treasure land—a supreme spiritual vein capable of sustaining Golden Core cultivators.  

At the center of the lake stood a jade pavilion, its railings and pillars exquisitely carved and dazzlingly opulent. Figures already crowded its platform, indicating many had arrived before him.  

Frowning slightly at the gathering, Gu Yuan nonetheless steered his flying shuttle toward the jade terrace.  

---  

"Esteemed Daoist, have you also come to seek the Gold-Severing Mystic Grass?"  

As soon as Gu Yuan landed, a tall and graceful maidservant draped in colorful ribbons approached him.  

Her eyes sparkled brightly, and atop her raven-black hair rested a naturally formed, luminous jade shell that seemed fused with her body.  

A shell maiden—a favored attendant among aristocratic families. Gentle, long-lived, and of a different race, they could be bound by spiritual contracts to ensure loyalty.  

Gu Yuan glanced at her and nodded slightly.  

"Please follow me, Daoist."  

With a soft smile, the shell maiden led him into a grand jade hall.  

The hall was spacious, adorned with pearls, agates, golden bells, and jade chimes arranged in luxurious harmony. Compared to Gu Yuan's austere Qian Yuan Cave, it was incomparably lavish.  

Inside, over twenty jade tables and meditation cushions had been arranged, each already occupied by a seated cultivator—all at the peak of the eighth layer of Qi Refinement.  

Gu Yuan was momentarily taken aback.  

So many people?  

Noticing his surprise, the shell maiden explained gently,  

"The Gold-Severing Mystic Grass not only breaks through cultivation barriers but also refines spiritual energy and enhances sword seals. Thus, even those in the Dao Academy capable of breaking through to the ninth layer of Qi Refinement on their own will suppress their cultivation to await the chance to obtain this grass."  

"Moreover, some come on behalf of others—friends, family, or for trade. Anyone with access to a golden invitation will attend."  

"Our family does not sell the mystic grass for spirit stones but to forge connections. This is a discreet yet grand occasion, hence the turnout."  

---  

Understanding dawned on Gu Yuan.  

So that was why Xiang Ronghua had warned him to brace himself.  

After a brief pause, the shell maiden guided him to a jade table and cushion before gracefully withdrawing.  

Nearby cultivators glanced at his plain attire before turning away.  

Gu Yuan scanned the room and noticed most either bore family crests on their sleeves or jade tokens at their waists—marks of aristocratic lineage or positions within the academy.  

Only a handful, like him, lacked such identifiers.  

Yet he recognized none of them.  

Clearly, today's gathering was of a different circle.  

But Gu Yuan paid it no mind, closing his eyes to meditate.  

Before long, once the hall was filled, the chime of jade pendants echoed from the rear.  

Opening his eyes, Gu Yuan saw a stunning young woman step forward, her attire adorned with intricate ornaments, draped in flowing silks, and her long skirt trailing elegantly.  

Her beauty surpassed even Yun Hanxiu's, her lips curled in a faint smile, her starry eyes exuding serenity—a calm unshaken by any adversity.  

"My apologies for keeping you waiting, honored senior brothers."  

Her voice matched her demeanor—soft, gentle, and soothing.  

"Junior Sister Bian is too courteous. Today, we are the ones seeking your family's favor. There is no need for apologies."  

A tall young man at the front table immediately rose to respond.  

A neighboring cultivator, beaten to the reply, snorted and sat back down.  

"Thank you for your understanding, senior brothers."  

Bian Chuyao bowed gracefully before addressing the crowd with a troubled expression.  

"However, there is only one stalk of mystic grass, yet over twenty of you have come. What shall we do?"
