# Chapter 60: When Traveling, Rely on Your Younger Sister

The atmosphere instantly grew oppressive.

The world seemed to freeze, all sounds vanishing as if everything had lost its voice.

The hunchbacked, balding old man's smile stiffened. Finally, he extended his withered, claw-like hand and began kneading his cheeks with sheer physical force, forcibly molding his expression into a radiant smile before declaring cheerfully:

"Good."

"Excellent."

"Our village is remote, and visitors are rare. Even when someone does come, they usually look down on what we have to offer."

"Finally, we've met someone who genuinely appreciates our gifts."

"Asking for anything in return would be an insult to us."

The village chief thumped his chest proudly. "We may be poor, but we have our dignity."

"Mrs. Du, go to my house and fetch the black-boned chicken I've been raising for this young man to take with him."

"It nourishes the blood, strengthens the spleen, and replenishes yin—perfect for women."

Old Mrs. Du's eyes remained fixed on Dou Changsheng, her gaze unblinking. Her lips twitched several times as if she wanted to say something, but in the end, she restrained herself.

Seeing this, the village chief grew impatient. "What are you standing around for?"

"Hurry up and go."

"If we slight our guest, word will spread that we lack manners."

"Haven't I always said? A man may be poor, but he must never lose his backbone or his courtesy."

Old Mrs. Du finally looked away, her voice hoarse as she replied, "Wait here!"

She shouldered her carrying pole and trudged back into the village. Once she was out of sight, the village chief's smile widened further. "Young man, your surname is Dou, isn't it?"

"You looked familiar earlier, but I didn't recognize you right away—my mistake."

"A prodigy on the Human Ranking, a young hero."

"First time on the list and already ranked seventy-ninth—truly a rare talent in this world."

"For a great personage like you to visit our humble village brings us immense honor."

"We should be slaughtering chickens and sheep to properly host you, Young Hero Dou. But the village has been... inconvenient lately. Just days ago, Old Man Li from the east end wandered into the woods, got lost, and by the time we found him, he had starved to death."

"Last night, we just held his funeral. The village has been busy these past few days."

"Our hospitality is lacking, I'm afraid."

"And since the village is poor, all we can offer as an apology is this black-boned chicken."

As the village chief finished speaking, Old Mrs. Du returned, clutching a black-boned chicken—small-headed, short-necked, with black eyes, a tiny comb, and stubby wings.

Ignoring the chicken's struggles, the village chief snatched it with his claw-like hand and personally handed it to Dou Changsheng, then adopted a posture of farewell, as if unwilling to lay eyes on him a moment longer.

Dou Changsheng knew when to quit. He didn't push his luck.

The situation felt off, and he had his doubts.

Why was the world so dangerous?

Where had all these perilous figures come from?

Cities being dangerous made sense—people sought wealth, birds sought food. The rich congregated in large cities, and the strong were no different. That was why major cities teemed with powerful figures.

But this remote village should have been a place where martial artists were a rare sight. Yet, in his experience, every villager seemed more dangerous than the last.

It gave Dou Changsheng the overwhelming urge to flee back to the city, thinking, *The village is too dangerous—I need to get back to town.*

Holding the black-boned chicken, Dou Changsheng cast a long, deep look at the village chief, then at Old Mrs. Du, before finally turning to leave.

As his figure gradually vanished into the distance, the village chief's smile faded. His gaze grew profound, then turned icy as he glared at Old Mrs. Du, his expression darkening into something ghostly and sinister.

His voice was low and menacing. "Were you planning to leave just now?"

"Don't forget—it was you who begged me back then."

"I took pity on you and allowed you to stay here."

"And now, after so few years, you dare think of betraying me?"

"Old Man Li chose death—do you also wish to die?"

Old Mrs. Du gave a bitter laugh. She pointed at herself, then yanked at her own dry, silver-white hair, tearing out a clump and letting it scatter in the wind.

"Is this living?"

"Neither human nor ghost—what kind of existence is this?"

The village chief sneered. "If you want to live, you must pay the price."

"You people are too greedy—you want to live, but also demand perfect health, free from all ailments."

"Since when does the world offer such luxuries?"

"In my youth, I was renowned for my handsome looks. Now look at me—reduced to this wretched state. Who do I complain to?"

"I'm too soft-hearted. That's why people keep defying me."

"A hundred years ago, I visited Changzhou. There was an ancient battlefield there, thick with yin energy. I posed as the governor and used the imperial court's resources to alter the city's layout, constructing a Yin Gathering Formation."

"By now, the accumulated pure yin energy has nearly reached its limit. In the coming days, anomalies will surely arise."

"Old Man Li thought death would free him—what a fool."

"These past few days, I've been using secret arts to reconstruct his corpse. After eighty-one days, he will awaken."

"Unless I permit it, even in death, he will become a ghost under my command."

"Here's some news for you: Daliang City is in turmoil. Gongsu Duwang, the 'Divine Craftsman' and leader of the Mechanism Sect, has been unusually active lately. With the destruction of the border fortresses between Liang and the Northern Jin, tensions in Liang are high. He's been rallying support—trouble is brewing."

"Your Du clan, as one of Daliang's great families, will be the first to suffer."

Old Mrs. Du shook her head. "When I first came here, I couldn't let go of the Du clan. But after all these years—neither alive nor dead—the Dus must find their own fortune. They can't rely on a half-dead old woman like me."

The village chief scoffed. "Stubborn words."

"Rest easy—I have no designs on them."

"My only goal is to open the Netherworld and establish reincarnation."

"I'm telling you this so you know: if you wish to save the Dus, you may come to me anytime."

"The price is simple. My desolate village cannot truly become the Netherworld—each attempt fails at the last moment. Those who have been dead too long have stale death and yin energy. I need fresh deaths—many of them."

"Your strength, as a former eleventh-ranked Earth List expert, is more than enough to unleash catastrophe."

Old Mrs. Du fell silent before reluctantly asking, "Daoist Ming, as a Heaven List powerhouse, wouldn't it be easier for you to do this yourself?"

Daoist Ming—the village chief—laughed coldly. "Though I often deal with the dead, my hands have never been stained with blood. I have never killed a single person in my life."

"I am, in fact, a good man."

"I have always stood firmly against evil!"

"Pack your things. Now that the Demoness knows of this place, we must relocate."
