Chapter 40: Boredom

The golden withered bones, whose they were, or what part of the body they belonged to, and how many years had passed, remained unknown. Yet, an imposing aura still enveloped them. Golden light emanated, and the chanting of Buddhist sutras resounded in the void. The area enveloped by the golden light from the withered bones transformed into a Buddhist Pure Land, where countless ethereal figures of ancient Buddhas and Bodhisattvas flickered into existence. The owner of these withered bones was clearly a Buddha-level figure in their lifetime!

The Saint took the withered bones and, with a wave of his hand, put away the scroll. The final words of that figure echoed forth: "Don't forget, I want the Mandate of Heaven!"

An excited expression appeared on the Saint's face. He sat cross-legged, the golden bone hovering above his forehead, light enveloping his entire body. The half-saint, half-demon state reappeared on his face, but this time it was no longer grotesque. Profound auras manifested in the area, and a flower sprite curiously hopped around on his head...

Meanwhile, inside the Tianqin Imperial Palace...

Zhou Tian was indulging in a lavish feast with Tian Ling. The people from Great Luo Academy and Qi Kingdom had already departed, leaving only a few of them in the entire palace. It would be a waste not to eat.

"Come, Ling'er, try this wine, it's quite good..." Zhou Tian picked up a glass of wine as thick as honey and handed it to Tian Ling.

"Mm-hm..." Tian Ling took the glass. Zhou Tian had been constantly urging her to eat, and these foods contained abundant energy substances that weren't easily absorbed, so she indeed felt a bit choked. Watching the wine slide from the glazed glass into Tian Ling's cherry lips, Zhou Tian couldn't help but swallow the tender meat in his own mouth. A touch of crimson appeared on her face...

"Come, Tian Ling, this glass of wine is also good..."

"...I hear this wine is also good..."

"Zhou Tian, why are you continuously making Sister Tian Ling drink? You're not trying to get her drunk and then plot something improper, are you?!" Liu Yan's sarcastic voice came from the side. She had certainly not forgotten Zhou Tian's backbiting about her.

Tian Ling, holding her wine glass, flushed even deeper, unsure if it was from the alcohol or something else.

"Go on, go on, go play somewhere else. Do you think I'm like your family's Zhou Zui, unable to restrain myself? Life always needs a sense of ceremony!" Zhou Tian said impatiently.

"You...!" Liu Yan's face was crimson, clearly from anger, her ample chest heaving. She felt Zhou Tian was a bit different now. The old Zhou Tian wouldn't have spoken like this; it wasn't that he didn't dare, but rather that he was too lazy to mention it. Now, why did he have such a nasty sense of humor...?

"Come, come, Sister Tian Ling, let's go..." Liu Yan couldn't do anything to Zhou Tian, so she could only target Tian Ling, forcibly pulling her away, giving Zhou Tian a fierce glare before turning and leaving.

Faint, almost indistinct voices drifted back:

"Sister Liu, what did Zhou Tian mean by that?!"

"Oh dear... Sister Tian Ling, why do you learn all the bad things instead of the good ones? Don't ask about such nonsense... it's all just talk."

"Oh."

Zhou Tian couldn't help but smile. Tian Ling was indeed a bit tipsy from the wine...

What to do when your girlfriend gets snatched away? Zhou Tian looked around and could only gravitate towards the group of guys over there.

"Oh, so Prince Qin's heir isn't playing with his little Ling'er anymore? How did you remember us old men?" Zhou Xunchuan remarked teasingly when he saw him approach.

"Little Ling'er is for *you* to call?" Zhou Tian shot him a glance, then grabbed an unidentified creature's leg from nearby and stuffed it into his mouth, mumbling: "Zhou Zui, when are you going to take Liu Yan? That woman needs someone to conquer her!"

"Exactly, Prince Xiaoyao's heir, she's a thorny golden flower! What an achievement that would be!" Zhang Yi chimed in from the side. Although this guy looked refined and aloof, as if he didn't belong to the mortal world, he was quite a quietly lustful one deep down.

"My brothers, please, keep your voices down!" Zhou Zui's small face turned deathly pale. He hastily cast a sound-sealing array. Then he gave a bitter smile: "When she sees me, she wishes she could roast me alive! Conquer her? Don't make me laugh!"

"A love-hate relationship. Can't you see that? The deeper the love, the stronger the hate!" Zhou Tian said casually. This kind of plot had been overused in TV dramas in his previous life.

"She only has hate for me, no love..." Zhou Zui didn't believe it at all. "The deeper the love, the stronger the hate"? After Zhou Tian's sophistry just now, he understood: this guy was full of twisted logic!

"Sigh, what exactly happened between you two back then, or didn't happen...?" Li Xuanyi leaned in and asked. The others also perked up their ears curiously; this matter was an unsolved mystery in the Imperial City.

"No, truly no!" Zhou Zui said helplessly. "Although we were both drunk at the time, I clearly knew that absolutely nothing happened! How many times have I explained it? Why don't you believe me? If something really did happen, Prime Minister Liu would cleave me alive!"

"Tch~ boring." Zhou Tian was disappointed, then asked again: "Then why does she hate you so much?!"

"Sigh..." A strange expression appeared on Zhou Zui's face. "It's a long story!"

"A long story? Brother Sui, come calculate it. What's so hard to explain here?" Gu Feng turned and said to Sun Sui.

"Don't mess with me. Calculating matters between Prince Xiaoyao's heir and Prime Minister Liu's daughter? Do you think I haven't lived long enough? For this, you should find Zhang Yi; his master is the Imperial Preceptor!" Sun Sui spat out an unknown fruit seed and shook his head.

"Oh, Sun Sui, you're taking private revenge now. Didn't I just beat you by one move in chess? Do you have to persecute me to death over it?" Zhang Yi hastily waved his hand.

"Not one move, but half a move! And you won by cheating!" Sun Sui retorted.

The topic was thus gradually diverted, both intentionally and unintentionally. Zhou Tian always felt there was more to it, but Zhou Zui wouldn't say anything no matter how much he was asked. He mused that he needed to find a way to pry open Zhou Zui's mouth. "[Sacred Word] is still on cooldown; otherwise, I could give it a try." As a good friend of Zhou Zui and Liu Yan, Zhou Tian believed it was his responsibility and duty to help this fated pair achieve happiness.

Who! Who said I had nothing better to do? Step forward!

Just as the group of men were chitchatting, the Qin Emperor, along with his ministers and those who had returned today, arrived. Aside from the Emperor, the others were quite surprised that only people from the Tianqin Empire remained in the palace, but none of them asked further questions. What followed was the tedious procedure. Although the other guests had departed, the necessary protocols still had to be observed. After praising those who had returned today and delivering a great deal of nonsense, the more formal banquet began. Unlike before, they couldn't just cast a sound-sealing array and speak freely.

Led by his elder and second brothers, he met each of the returnees one by one, familiarizing himself with them to avoid not knowing their names in future encounters. It was apparent that Zhou Yu's prestige among these individuals was quite high, and consequently, they treated Zhou Tian very courteously. Although he was quite eager to know where they had been fighting, it was clearly not the appropriate time to ask. Zhou Tian could only suppress his inner curiosity.

And so, he endured and endured, until the banquet finally came to an end...
