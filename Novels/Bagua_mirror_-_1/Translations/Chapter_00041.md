# Chapter 41: Father and Son

That night, Qin Chong had a long conversation with his third uncle, learning many things he hadn't noticed before. His uncle's aptitude wasn't good—he possessed a pseudo-spiritual root with four attributes. After decades of cultivation, he had barely reached the late Qi Refining stage. In recent years, he had sacrificed much of his cultivation time for family matters, which deeply moved Qin Chong.

Despite his uncle's tireless efforts traveling outside, the meager resources he earned were all given to the family—or more precisely, to Qin Chong and his two brothers. Qin Chong silently resolved in his heart that with the miraculous Eight Trigrams Mirror in his possession, even if his cultivation path wasn't entirely smooth, it would still be far better than most cultivators'. One day, when he had sufficient strength, he would find a way to help his uncle advance further on the cultivation path—at least to help him reach Foundation Establishment. Otherwise, his lifespan would only be a few decades longer than an ordinary mortal's.

In the past, Qin Chong had once dreamed of becoming a lone wanderer. But as time passed, he realized that walking alone would never take him far. Even cultivators needed to band together for warmth.

Unity was strength, and numbers brought power—these principles remained timeless even in the cultivation world. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many families attaching themselves to major sects, nor would so many clan disciples and rogue cultivators fight tooth and nail to join them. After all, only with a foundation and backing could one obtain more cultivation resources and opportunities.

Early the next morning, Qin Chong and his uncle each took one person and flew toward Mount Xiao on their swords.

"Lucky I ran into you in the city," his uncle said with a laugh as they flew. "Carrying these two kids alone would've been exhausting."

"Third Uncle, I always thought you were too heavy. You should eat less in the future, or even flying alone will tire you out."

"Go on, you brat. Now you're teasing your uncle?"

For Qi Refining cultivators, sword flight was already extremely taxing on their spiritual energy. Carrying passengers while also using energy to protect the two children naturally made it even more strenuous. With Qin Chong taking one of them, his uncle felt much more at ease.

When the two arrived at the family estate, they saw five figures waiting outside the main gate: Qin Chong's father, Qin Hao, along with the rest of the Qin family—his stepmother Madame Huang, his younger brothers Qin Peng and Qin Fei, and his sixth uncle Qin Yong. The previous night, the third uncle had already sent word to the family.

This was essentially the entirety of the Qin family's cultivators. The nominal guest cultivators didn't count as true family members—they only appeared when needed and didn't reside at the estate.

As they landed, Qin Peng was the first to rush forward and hug Qin Chong. "Big brother, you're really alive!"

Though Qin Hao's expression remained calm, a hint of emotion flickered in his eyes. "Father, Sixth Uncle, Stepmother—I'm back. I've worried you all."

Qin Chong bowed to each of them in turn.

"It's good that you're back," Qin Hao said in a low, steady voice.

At that moment, Qin Chong felt a warmth in his heart—one he hadn't felt in a long time.

After brief pleasantries, Qin Hao said, "Old Six, Old Three, you two settle these children in." Then he turned to Qin Peng and Qin Fei. "You two go back with your mother to cultivate. The Canglong Valley's disciple recruitment is approaching—you need to focus."

"Yes, Father!"

"Big brother, we'll head back first," the brothers said.

Once the others had left, Qin Hao studied Qin Chong for a moment before saying, "Chong'er, come with me to the main hall."

"Yes, Father."

Though Qin Chong complied outwardly, inwardly he sighed. It seemed he'd have to recount his narrow survival yet again—but there was no helping it.

In the vast hall, only father and son remained. Qin Hao sat upright in the master's seat while Qin Chong stood respectfully nearby, recounting his experiences in detail. As he listened, Qin Hao couldn't help but sigh softly.

This time, Qin Chong's account was far more thorough than before, though he still omitted certain critical details. It wasn't that he distrusted his father, but some things were better kept to himself.

"To think you've been through so much. You've endured hardships."

"If not for this experience, I wouldn't have broken through in cultivation. In a way, it wasn't entirely bad. The path of cultivation is always fraught with life-and-death trials."

Hearing this, Qin Hao's expression shifted slightly as he gazed at his son. After a pause, he sighed. "Ah, my child has grown up. It seems your father has grown old."

"Don't think like that, Father. You still have many years ahead."

"Your third uncle mentioned you've settled matters with Canglong Valley?"

"At Cangwu Mine, I was fortunate to meet Senior Meng Fei. In Pingyang City, I sought him out specifically to return the spirit stones I'd taken from the mine. He agreed to mediate—it shouldn't be a problem now."

"If Meng Fei is involved, the matter should indeed be resolved. His status in Canglong Valley is not low."

"To be honest, I didn't know his position in the sect—I just happened to meet him. That's why I sought him out upon returning to Pingyang."

Qin Hao nodded slightly before changing the subject. "Now that you've reached the sixth layer of Qi Refining, what are your plans?"

The sudden question gave Qin Chong pause. "Father plans to send Qin Fei to Canglong Valley?"

"That's right. Qin Fei has an Earth-grade spiritual root. His cultivation is already the same as yours, and he's still young. There should be no obstacles to his entry."

"That's for the best. Major sects never lack cultivation resources—he'll have better prospects there."

"And you? You know our family's situation. Though we're few in number, supporting everyone isn't easy."

"I'd like to try Canglong Valley's entrance trials. If I pass by some chance, all the better. If not, I'll treat it as experience."

Qin Hao's expression grew solemn. "At your current cultivation level and age, competing against late-stage Qi Refining cultivators on the arena platform would be nearly hopeless. Many are injured or killed in those matches each time. Think carefully."

"I've already decided. The opportunity is there—how could I live with myself if I didn't try?"

As he spoke, Qin Chong's eyes were firm, his demeanor calm.

"Since you've made up your mind, prepare well in the coming days. Tell me whatever you need—I'll arrange it."

"Don't worry, Father. I have my own plans."

Suddenly, Qin Fei's voice interrupted from outside the hall. "Big brother, Mother wants to see you."

Qin Hao nodded. "Go see what she wants."

From his father's expression, Qin Chong sensed he already knew why his stepmother had summoned him—and so did Qin Chong. "Then I'll take my leave."

With that, Qin Chong turned and left the hall, where Qin Fei waited for him.
