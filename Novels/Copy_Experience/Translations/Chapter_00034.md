Looking at the lines of text on the bluestone tablet, a smile appeared on Lu Xu's face. After breaking through to the fifth layer of Qi Condensation, his lifespan had reached 121 years, meaning he could live for another ninety years or more. The time spent cultivating was nothing compared to the increase in lifespan brought by cultivation breakthroughs. Now, at twenty-four, he had only been in the cultivation world for nine years, yet his cultivation had already reached the fifth layer of Qi Condensation. If this news were to spread, Lu Xu feared he would become a renowned genius in the cultivation world of Wei State! Because even cultivators with average high-grade spirit roots would struggle to achieve such rapid cultivation!

"Who would have thought that a small spiritual farmer back then could reach this point? Now I'm considered a minor expert in the cultivation world!"
"I've reached the threshold for becoming a rogue cultivator!"
"But thinking about it, although I haven't been a rogue cultivator, the wealth I possess was entirely accumulated by relying on rogue cultivators!" Lu Xu thought to himself, looking at his storage bag.

The wealth he now possessed was almost unmatched among Qi Condensation cultivators: around two thousand three hundred spirit stones, two high-grade magic tools, seven mid-grade magic tools, four storage bags, a flying magic tool, an alchemy furnace, and over a hundred spirit herbs, which included ten particularly valuable sets of Qi Nourishing Pill ingredients! Lu Xu roughly estimated that the total value of everything he owned amounted to around six thousand five hundred spirit stones! This was truly an astonishing figure.

"I really have to thank Mo Changkong. Next, I'll make good use of these resources for cultivation! I also need to explore things like secret markets to dispose of this pile of magic tools!" Lu Xu thought to himself. After adjusting his breath for a moment, he turned and entered a stone room in the courtyard.

The Earth Fire Room!

The furnishings in the Earth Fire Room were simple. There were many hollowed-out alcoves in the stone walls where things could be placed. On the ground stood a stone beast with its mouth wide open, faintly revealing some dark marks inside.

Lu Xu twisted a switch on the stone beast, and immediately a wave of heat surged forth, with a scorching flame spewing from the beast's mouth. "Not bad, not bad!" Lu Xu praised twice, then took out a crimson alchemy furnace from his storage bag. Mo Changkong's alchemy furnace was of excellent quality; if sold outside, it would probably fetch five or six hundred spirit stones. The fist-sized alchemy furnace flew from Lu Xu's hand and quickly enlarged, silently hovering above the earth fire, absorbing the flames. The color of the furnace gradually became scorching hot.

This was Lu Xu's first time refining pills, but he was already experienced. He could precisely control the heat, master every key point of alchemy. He was like an old hand who had been refining pills for decades, accurately controlling every detail. Soon after, when he saw that the heat was about right, Lu Xu formed a hand seal, and the lid of the alchemy furnace immediately opened. With a sweep of his hand, five or six jade boxes automatically opened, and the spirit herbs contained within flew out. They arranged themselves in the air, then slowly entered the alchemy furnace one by one, following a specific order. Under the scorching of the earth fire, the spirit herbs either transformed into medicinal liquid or medicinal powder. Lu Xu controlled the heat while carefully separating various impurities.

Time flowed by like this. In a blink of an eye, three days passed. During these three days, Lu Xu remained in the Earth Fire Room, not coming out. Alchemy was not easy work; he had to constantly monitor the situation inside the furnace. When hungry, he would eat a grain of Spirit Grain Pill. This first-tier low-grade pill could keep one from hunger for three days after just one grain. Spirit Grain Pills were quite cheap, a bottle only costing three spirit stones, containing ten pills, enough to sustain one for a month without needing food.

Three days later, a clear chime echoed from the alchemy furnace. The lid was abruptly forced open, and streaks of light shot out from within. Lu Xu quickly reached out and beckoned, and the streaks of light flew towards him, landing in his hand. Four crimson glowing pills lay quietly in his hand. Lu Xu flipped his palm, and a jade bottle appeared in his hand, into which he placed all of them. Then he formed a hand seal, and six dim streaks of light flew out from the alchemy furnace. After landing in his hand, they transformed into six dull medicinal dregs. Lu Xu gently squeezed, and one of the dregs turned into a pile of powder, scattering on the ground.

"One set of ingredients yielded four pills, and six waste dregs! One Qi Nourishing Pill is worth fifteen spirit stones, while one set of ingredients costs approximately twenty spirit stones. Refining this batch of pills earned forty spirit stones!"

Earning forty spirit stones in three days, talisman making really couldn't compare to alchemy! Putting away the jade bottle, Lu Xu continued refining pills. A month passed, and all ten sets of Qi Nourishing Pill ingredients he had were used up. Lu Xu now had forty-five Qi Nourishing Pills, equivalent to four and a half bottles.

"Hmm, in this past month, I've earned four hundred and seventy-five spirit stones. This money was too easy to earn, but now I'm out of materials! I should refine all the other two types of pills as well!"

Lu Xu continued refining pills, and soon, the few sets of ingredients for Limb Regeneration Pills and Beauty Nourishing Pills were also completely used up. Swallowing a Beauty Nourishing Pill, Lu Xu silently refined it, slowing down the aging of his appearance. Beauty Nourishing Pill was a first-tier mid-grade pill, one pill worth five spirit stones. Taking one could guarantee a year of youth. Cultivators, especially younger ones who cared about their appearance, highly sought after this pill. It was said that above the Beauty Nourishing Pill, there was a second-tier pill called the Youth-Preserving Pill. Taking this pill could keep one eternally young, their appearance never decaying until death. However, the price of this pill was truly exorbitant, one pill costing a thousand spirit stones to acquire. For cultivators devoted to the Grand Dao, who cared nothing for their appearance, such a pill was worthless. But there were still some cultivators who cared deeply about their appearance, especially female cultivators. Even if it delayed their cultivation a bit, they would spend spirit stones to buy Beauty Nourishing Pills to maintain their youth.

"Now I could debut as an alchemist! But I'll wait a bit longer. These pills are mainly for my own use, no rush to sell them!"

Putting away the alchemy furnace and cleaning up the Earth Fire Room, Lu Xu rested for a few days. Afterward, he stepped out of his small courtyard and began to thoroughly familiarize himself with the immortal city and its surrounding areas.

"Good boxing!"
"What powerful force!"
"Boom!"

On the arena, a cold-faced young man in black threw a punch, sending a strong, bald man opposite him flying.
"What? 'Iron Yama' actually lost?!"
"Even Iron Yama couldn't block his punch. What's this kid's origin?"
"Who knows? This person suddenly appeared recently, no one knows his background!"
"Iron Yama is already one of the few top-tier masters in the world. To defeat him so easily, this young man must be the pinnacle of human martial arts!"
"So young, yet so powerful, and appearing suddenly in the capital city... I think his origin can only be one possibility!"
"Brother, do you mean the Imperial Family?"

"Precisely, it can only be the Imperial Family. It is said that they possess the world's most supreme martial arts secret techniques, which, when cultivated to their deepest level, can even contend with cultivators!"
"Cultivators? Are there really cultivators in this world?"
"Hard to say. I have friends who have seen cultivators fly through the sky, but I've never witnessed it myself!"
"Some say the Imperial Family is related to cultivators, is that true?"

"Martial arts secret techniques that can contend with cultivators?" Standing on the arena, listening to the discussions below, a sharp glint suddenly flashed in Lu Xu's eyes. During this period, he had disguised himself as a cold-faced young man in black, frequently making moves in the capital and sparring with various Jianghu experts. After defeating multiple first-rate masters, Lu Xu confirmed that his martial arts strength had reached the pinnacle of Wei State. In Wei State's Jianghu, there were divisions of first-rate, second-rate, third-rate, and unranked practitioners. First-rate masters dominated a state, second-rate masters dominated a province, and third-rate masters dominated a county. Before embarking on the immortal path, Lu Xu was a rising star in Clear Stream County, Yunzhou, Wei State. He began learning martial arts at a martial arts academy and gradually became the top practitioner there. However, with his strength back then, he couldn't even be considered a third-rate master. And now, he could easily defeat a first-rate Jianghu master.

Over the years, Lu Xu's entire focus had been on cultivation, and he hadn't deliberately practiced martial arts. He merely practiced the Pine Crane Longevity Fist a few times after eating demon beast meat. As a result, unknowingly, his martial arts strength underwent a transformation.

"With my martial arts strength increased, my physical body has also been strengthened, making the physical body hurdle during Foundation Establishment much easier to overcome! However, from my current situation, martial arts has reached its limit at this point; it seems impossible to advance further. And with this level of strength, contending with cultivators is simply impossible. Are this person's words about the Imperial Family possessing martial arts secret techniques that can contend with cultivators true or false?"

A strong sense of doubt flashed in Lu Xu's eyes. He leaped off the arena, and in a blink, his figure vanished into the crowd.

"I seem to recall hearing before that the Wei Imperial Family possesses a secret technique that can increase the chance of Foundation Establishment, and it's related to the physical body. Could this be a higher-tier martial arts secret technique? It seems this Wei State Imperial Family is worth a thorough investigation!"

Many thoughts flashed through his mind. Lu Xu quietly removed his bronze mask, reverting to his original appearance, and flew towards Tianmen City. By then, it was late. Passing through a forest, Lu Xu suddenly saw several flashes of light in the distance. His heart stirred, and he used his Spirit Eye Technique to look in that direction. Someone was fighting!

"Huh? Is that Fatty Mo?"
