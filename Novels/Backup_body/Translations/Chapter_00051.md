# Chapter 51: I See No Worthy Opponents in the Central Plains!

Four Leaves City.

The sky was shrouded in dark clouds, which upon closer inspection turned out to be swarms of flying insects. A dense fog enveloped the city, composed entirely of tiny fluttering wings. Countless ants and crawling insects emerged from the earth, blanketing the entire city in an endless tide of vermin.

"Are all these swarming insects actually Gu insects?"

"Most likely, he's using Gu insects to summon ordinary pests, but there are plenty of poisonous ones mixed in, along with a large number of actual Gu insects."

"I've heard Xin Xuan is revered as the Gu King by all seventeen tribes of the Southern Wastelands, his status akin to a deity!"

"Aside from the Gu insects he personally cultivated, he brought half of all Gu insects refined by the seventeen tribes when he came to the Central Plains..."

"If he hadn't lost most of his Gu insects in the capital and used large numbers as decoys in Jingye and Tianyuan Prefectures, this scene would be even more terrifying!"

"Order all disciples to retreat! No reckless actions—being devoured by these insects would leave no remains!"

"Even with our protective qi shielding us, we must fear Xin Xuan hiding his 'Divine King Gu' among the swarms to ambush us!"

"His 'Divine King Gu' is lethally poisonous. Even inner sect elders like us would be hard-pressed to survive its venom! Elder Gu, who intercepted him in the capital, only survived by taking the 'Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pill'—and he's still bedridden!"

The elders gathered outside Four Leaves City, ordering their disciples to withdraw. Even the Beast Taming Hall, renowned for countering Gu techniques, felt their hearts tremble at this sight.

The Beast Taming Hall elder's expression shifted as he muttered, "In a direct confrontation with Gu King Xin Xuan, I wouldn't fear him. Even if he's refined the Divine King Gu, I have divine beasts to counter it. But this time, he's pulled out all stops—half the Gu insect reserves of seventeen tribes are in his hands..."

Elder Chen Xuan of the Ancient Moon Peak said grimly, "No wonder the elite troops of the Great Zhou court suffered heavy losses trying to intercept him yet failed to stop him. Elder Gu's defeat in the capital wasn't unjustified..."

A loud crash echoed as an elder tumbled out from the insect swarm ahead, his face pale with terror. This was the inner sect elder from the Formation Pavilion of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. Thirty-two high-grade spirit talismans were affixed to his body.

"Impossible..." the Formation Pavilion elder gasped. "With all my meridians open, qi shielding my body, formations inscribed on my skin, and these thirty-two talismans, no ordinary Gu insect could approach me. But..."

He stared at the city. "Xin Xuan is inside! His Divine King Gu shattered my talisman defenses, broke through my inscribed formations, and nearly pierced my protective qi. Had I not prepared in advance, I'd be dead already!"

The presence of his Divine King Gu meant Xin Xuan was undoubtedly here. This ruled out any feint or diversion tactic. Though they didn't know why Xin Xuan had revealed himself, as long as they could trap him here, the problem would be solved.

"Beast Taming Hall disciples, deploy all your exotic beasts to surround Four Leaves City! Devour the surrounding Gu insects and pests—don't let the swarm expand further!"

The disciples obeyed, unleashing their spirit beasts and avian companions to guard the city's perimeter, ensuring not a single insect could escape. Instantly, a brutal battle erupted between the spirit beasts and the Gu insects. Many poisonous and Gu insects were devoured, but numerous spirit beasts also fell to venom, their corpses consumed by the swarms.

Disciples from other branches guarded other directions, unleashing their skills to exterminate swathes of Gu insects—though some perished from momentary carelessness.

"Why hasn't Lu Huaiyuan arrived yet?"

"With his perfected qi cultivation—all 365 acupoints unlocked, forming an unbreakable cycle—and his mastery of the Heavenly Flame Immolation Art, his qi shields him like fire. No Gu insect can approach him! His combat prowess is renowned—he could slay the Divine King Gu and capture Xin Xuan!"

The elders exchanged uneasy glances. Logically, Lu Huaiyuan should be nearby. While they couldn't breach the insect swarms to capture Xin Xuan, someone like Lu Huaiyuan could stroll through them unimpeded. Even the Divine King Gu would pose little threat if he remained cautious. Once he entered the city, the matter would be settled. Stripped of his Gu insects, Xin Xuan would be no match for the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's chief disciple.

"So... where is Lu Huaiyuan?"

Meanwhile, twenty li southwest of Four Leaves City, Lu Huaiyuan stood facing Elder Zhou Li of the Formation Pavilion.

"Elder Zhou Li, what is the meaning of this?" Lu Huaiyuan demanded. "Gu King Xin Xuan has revealed himself, and the disciples have sent distress signals. Yet you block my path—are you colluding with him?"

Elder Zhou Li brushed his sleeves. "What if I am?"

Lu Huaiyuan's eyes turned icy. Without hesitation, he drew his sword and advanced. "We've scoured Xuanling Prefecture for days, finding no trace of Xin Xuan. I thought he wasn't here—but it seems you've been sheltering him! Since you've betrayed the sect, don't blame me for being merciless. I'll kill you first, then capture Xin Xuan!"

His sword gleamed like scattered starlight, each point radiant and razor-sharp. The elder—actually the Ancient Moon Peak's Chief Law Enforcer in disguise—met the attack head-on. "I've long wanted to test the might of the sect's chief disciple!"

The Law Enforcer had no certainty of victory, but his task wasn't to defeat Lu Huaiyuan—only to delay him. Lu Huaiyuan had arrived too quickly. The young masters of Kunlun and the Diamond Temple, along with the imperial guards, hadn't yet arrived. He couldn't let Lu Huaiyuan enter the city and capture Xin Xuan prematurely.

Back in Four Leaves City, a figure descended from the sky, his aura razor-sharp.

"The Kunlun young master has arrived..." The elders exchanged glances. Logically, Lu Huaiyuan should have been closest—why had the Kunlun young master arrived first? If Xin Xuan was captured by an outsider on the Feather Transformation Sect's doorstep, it would be a massive loss of face.

Before they could react, the Kunlun young master ignored them and charged into the city.

"Wait, Young Master Kunlun! This is our—" Elder Chen Xuan's words were cut off as the young master vanished into the swarm.

At the peak of qi cultivation, with all acupoints unlocked—a perfected cycle—his qi shielded him flawlessly. His qi had been tempered into the Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi, its edge dulled but still lethally sharp. Insects approaching within ten feet disintegrated into dust.

As he advanced unimpeded, a high-tier Gu insect hidden among the swarm darted toward the back of his neck. But the closer it got, the fiercer his sword qi became. Three inches from his skin, it crumbled like all the others.

"The so-called Gu King is nothing special," the Kunlun young master remarked coolly, strolling through the swarm as if sightseeing.

From a high platform in the city, Xin Xuan sighed. "Truly worthy of being called the Central Plains' top swordsman, peerless beneath the Immortal realm!" He closed his eyes and murmured a command. His Divine King Gu let out a resonant cry that echoed through the city. Countless Gu insects shifted toward the Kunlun young master.

At that moment, the imperial guard commander arrived from another direction, followed by hundreds of soldiers. From the west, a young monk sat cross-legged on a floating kasaya, bathed in Buddhist light.

"Hiding like a rat, you were hard to find," the commander sneered. "Now that you've shown yourself, today is your death day!"

The Diamond Temple's young monk chanted a sutra and advanced from another direction.

"Elders, change of plans!" the Beast Taming Hall elder exclaimed. "With the Kunlun young master drawing most of the Gu insects eastward, the other directions are weakly defended. We can breach the city now!"

Elder Chen Xuan's spirits lifted. "Without his Gu insects, killing Xin Xuan would take but a single strike! Since Lu Huaiyuan isn't here, we can't let outsiders capture the Gu King on our doorstep!"

As forces converged from all sides, the Kunlun young master entered the city proper. Standing three thousand paces from Xin Xuan's platform, their eyes met across the distance. Xin Xuan felt the piercing sharpness of that gaze and sighed.

"With my Divine King Gu, I reached the qi realm and dominated the six domains of the Southern Wastelands. This time, I brought not only my own Gu insects but 230,000 from the seventeen tribes. I thought with these, I'd be invincible beneath the Immortal realm in the Central Plains..." He exhaled. "It seems the Central Plains aren't entirely devoid of talent."

A scoff came from another direction. "You thought a few hundred thousand Gu insects could conquer the Central Plains?" The imperial guard commander, clad in luminous armor, strode forward. "You think commanding insects is like commanding an army? The man before you is the strongest beneath the Immortal realm! Even if you had a real army, he could slay its general amidst ten thousand soldiers! Today, you fall!"

From the west, the young monk intoned, "The city's people are all dead... Gu King Xin Xuan, your death is certain!"

The Feather Transformation elders and disciples closed in from another side.

"All here, then?" Xin Xuan's gaze swept over the Kunlun young master, the Diamond Temple monk, the imperial commander, the Ancient Moon Peak elders, and hundreds of soldiers and disciples. "To think one man could draw three perfected qi experts, nearly ten qi cultivators, and over a thousand others to hunt me. It seems the Central Plains relies on numbers rather than skill!"

The young monk shook his head. "You wield Gu insects refined by seventeen tribes—how is that your own power?"

The Kunlun young master didn't respond. He simply kept walking. At six hundred paces, he drew his sword. A hundred paces around him, all Gu insects perished. With a surge of qi, he leaped forward.

"Your Gu insects cannot touch me. Only your Divine King Gu might try. But if even it fails, you're nothing but a toothless wolf—a crippled dog. To me, the Southern Wastelands' Gu King is but a single sword strike."

At that moment, brilliant light erupted from the platform. Starlight poured from the heavens, and Xin Xuan's form grew indistinct. Yet his voice echoed through the city:

"The entire Central Plains—the Great Zhou court, the immortal sects, the Buddhist temples—mobilized just for me. Today, you gather in force yet return empty-handed. What face do you have left? What elite troops? What immortal sects? What peerless swordsmen? Mere empty titles!"

His figure vanished, leaving only laughter ringing in the air.

"I see no worthy opponents in the Central Plains! Hahaha!"
