# Chapter 16: Mid-Stage Qi Refining  

After inspecting his two spirit fields and tidying up the courtyard, Chu Ning returned to his room and immediately pulled out the *Greenwood Eternal Spring Technique* from his robes.  

He had been stuck at the peak of the third layer of Qi Refining for nearly ten days. Now, with this manual in hand, he could finally break through to the fourth layer!  

Flipping through the pages, Chu Ning confirmed that this was indeed the complete *Greenwood Eternal Spring Technique*, containing three layers of cultivation methods that could take him all the way to the late stage of Qi Refining.  

To his delight, the manual also included two spells:  

- **Thorn Technique**, an offensive spell that could rapidly grow thorny vines to entangle and injure enemies.  
- **Vine Armor Technique**, a defensive spell that formed a protective barrier of vines around the caster.  

Both were mid-tier elementary spells, but mastering them would provide him with much-needed combat capabilities.  

During the incident when Qiu Shunyi had accidentally unleashed a *Blade Wind Technique*, Chu Ning had realized his lack of offensive and defensive spells. Now, with these two spells included in the manual, it was an unexpected boon.  

He decided then and there that, while advancing his cultivation, he would also dedicate time to mastering these spells.  

That afternoon, he meticulously studied the entire *Greenwood Eternal Spring Technique*, committing the breakthrough method for the fourth layer to memory.  

As night fell and he confirmed no one would disturb him, Chu Ning began his cultivation session.  

Having already reached the peak of the third layer days earlier, he smoothly transitioned into the fourth layer by following the second-layer cultivation method.  

Spiritual energy surged into his body, channeling into his dantian, where the three existing rings of qi could no longer expand. The newly absorbed qi compressed into the topmost third ring, eventually splitting off to form a fourth, larger ring—thin at first, but gradually stabilizing as Chu Ning continued refining his qi.  

Only when the fourth ring and its connection to the lower layers solidified did he finally exhale and conclude his session.

**Mid-Stage Qi Refining Achieved!**  

Chu Ning smiled in satisfaction. He didn’t know how fast the Earth Spirit Root disciple—who had directly entered the inner sect—was progressing, but he was confident his own speed placed him among the top of the new disciples.  

However, his smile quickly faded.  

The Green Stream Sect had over ten thousand Qi Refining disciples. While his Wood Tiger Spirit Body granted him impressive cultivation speed, he was still far from strong enough to let his guard down.  

He checked his mental interface:  

**[Greenwood Eternal Spring Technique (Yellow Tier, Low Grade), Second Layer (0/900)]**  

This puzzled him. Not only did the proficiency requirement jump to 900 points, but after over two hours of cultivation, it hadn’t increased by even a single point.  

Back when he first started, a single session had granted him 1 point.  

After some thought, he realized the reason: advancing through the mid-stage of Qi Refining required far more refined qi, making progress naturally slower. Even with his Wood Tiger Spirit Body, a single session wouldn’t be enough to raise his proficiency.  

Determined to test his limits, he resolved to measure exactly how long it took to gain a single point.  

---  

The next morning, after another session yielded no progress, Chu Ning turned his attention to his spirit fields.  

Since new disciples lacked complete spell training, the sect had prepared the fields by harvesting, clearing, and tilling them in advance. However, some weeds remained, requiring manual removal.  

This was a one-time convenience—from now on, he would be responsible for all aspects of cultivation, including food. For now, the sect provided rations, but in six months, he would need to exchange his harvests for supplies.  

After tidying the fields and using *Purge Weeds* to clear stray growths, Chu Ning returned home, cooked a simple meal, and resumed cultivation.  

This time, he finally saw progress:  

**[Greenwood Eternal Spring Technique (Yellow Tier, Low Grade), Second Layer (1/900)]**  

Calculating, he estimated that three sessions—effectively a full day’s cultivation—were needed for a single point.  

At this rate, reaching the peak of the sixth layer would take **900 days**. Factoring in time lost to recovery and other tasks, it would likely stretch to **three years**.  

"Too slow!" Chu Ning frowned.  

Even with his Wood Tiger Spirit Body, the low-grade *Greenwood Eternal Spring Technique* was a bottleneck. While others might envy his speed, having reached the fourth layer in just three months, he was far from satisfied.  

"I need to start cultivating spirit plants as soon as possible. The *Greenwood Flourish Technique* can accelerate my progress!"  

Originally, he had planned to practice the Thorn and Vine Armor Techniques, but now, speed took priority.  

Without delay, he grabbed a handful of spirit rice seeds—over a hundred in total—and headed to his medium-grade spirit field.  

For a second-layer cultivator, sprouting twenty seeds at once was the limit. But as a fourth-layer cultivator with mastery over *Accelerated Growth*, Chu Ning could handle nearly a hundred.  

With a single spell, the seeds sprouted into seedlings, which he then evenly distributed across the field using *Telekinesis*. While his telekinetic control over heavy objects was lacking, his Wood Tiger Spirit Body granted him exceptional precision with plant-based materials.  

This was just the beginning. Once he mastered spirit rice cultivation, he would move on to the more challenging Black Bamboo.
