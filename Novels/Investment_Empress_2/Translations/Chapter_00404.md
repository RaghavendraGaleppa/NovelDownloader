# Chapter 404: The Solution to the Underground Palace (1/2)

“Hm? Are we missing someone?”

In the great tomb, within a certain dark side chamber—though calling it a side chamber hardly did it justice, as it opened into a wondrous world of its own.

A quiet stream flowed from an underground river that had merged into a lake. Withered willow trees stood silently on floating bridges.

Tan Zhuyin turned back, a vague sense of unease washing over him.

Zhu Renji turned around, his cross-eyed stare deadly serious as he counted, shouting out the numbers:

“Holy Son, sixty-four people!”

“Sixty-four my ass! We only came down with forty people!”

Luo Yexian was startled, then slapped the back of Zhu Renji’s head. “It’s clearly thirty-two people.”

“We’re missing eight? When did that happen?”

Tan Zhuyin’s expression changed. He hadn’t noticed a thing.

This meant that the two Dharma Kings following him had also failed to detect anything amiss.

“The tomb owner might be the Ancestral God of Yunmeng. Can we communicate with them through the Ancestral God statue?” Luo Yexian asked.

Tan Zhuyin thought this was feasible. After a moment of contemplation, he took the Ancestral God statue from his robes.

After a brief attempt to sense a connection, he said in a deep voice, “It’s useless.”

Luo Yexian and the other Demon Cult members tried as well, then shook their heads.

This meant that either there was a formation in this tomb that rendered summoning arts ineffective, or the Dream God had fallen into slumber once more.

The latter seemed more likely. If it were the former, there wouldn’t have been a response earlier.

“Forget about finding those people for now. Let’s find the exit first.”

Tan Zhuyin’s voice seemed to be ‘trapped,’ traveling far across the empty lake surface.

The group of Demon Cultists continued forward on the floating bridges.

However, the bridges were incredibly long. Gradually, they walked faster and faster, but the scenery before them remained unchanged.

Tan Zhuyin’s impatience began to grow.

He was about to turn back and have the two Dharma Kings, who were at the Dharma Body Realm, take action.

Suddenly, Luo Yexian pointed ahead.

“What... is that?”

Everyone looked, and their expressions immediately changed.

It was a mess of corpses, exactly eight of them, each one dead in a miserable state, their eyes wide and round.

“Shi Yong! How did he die here?”

“How did they die without a sound?”

“There’s something sinister nearby...”

These Demon Cultists were no greenhorns, but seeing such a诡异 scene still made them gasp in shock.

This also meant they hadn’t gone far at all; they had been walking in circles!

Gurgle, gurgle—

Suddenly, the lake water began to churn. Countless shadows emerged from the water—hundreds or thousands of Dream Fiends. However, they didn’t attack but instead stared coldly at the Demon Cultists.

Hmm?

The Demon Cultists were creeped out, yet they couldn’t help but feel confused.

Two figures, one plump and one thin, suddenly appeared beside Tan Zhuyin. They were the two Dharma Kings who had come with him.

“The only thing that can make Dream Fiends restrain their craving for living beings is a higher-level existence.”

“This is the layout of the underground palace?”

Li Mo looked at the tomb layout on the ground.

This was what Tian Miao had just deduced. Li Mo had drawn it on paper based on her calculations.

Tian Miao nodded, her face a little pale. A trickle of blood dripped from the corner of her mouth. She smiled weakly, “Impressive, right?”

“...”

Li Mo didn’t expect Tian Miao to ask such a thing at a time like this. He could only give a thumbs-up, meaning “Awesome.”

Then he took out some natural treasures for replenishing blood and gave them to her. Who knew what they would encounter in the tomb? Having a bit more strength was always good.

“It looks a bit familiar...”

Ying Bing pondered thoughtfully, her slender hand gripping the sheathed Frost Sword as she pointed at the map.

A moment later, she turned back and said seriously, “I know how to get through now.”

Little Li leaned back slightly. “Ice Cube, are you sure? This isn’t Li Mo’s tomb...”

“?”

Ying Bing’s hand holding the sword sheath tightened involuntarily. She recalled the map that was filled with nothing but Li Mo...

But as everyone knows, the Ice Cube is best at pretending nothing happened, maintaining a cool and aloof expression as if she didn’t understand what he was talking about.

“I mean, this underground palace’s layout is like a game of Go.”

***

“You’ve played it before.”

“Huh?”

Li Mo squinted, examining it. He estimated that even if the board recognized him, he probably wouldn’t recognize the board.

Back then, he was too busy showing off in front of everyone.

Seeing the confusion in Little Li’s eyes, Ying Bing said softly, “The changes in this underground palace follow that game of Go.”

“The moment we stepped into the underground palace, we entered the game. On the board, some areas are killing moves. If you step into them unknowingly, the situation will become increasingly dangerous until it becomes a dead end.”

“A game of Go?”

Tian Miao leaned in to take a look, her face turning pale again. She quickly averted her gaze.

She looked dazed. “This kind of board... someone was actually able to solve it? This...”

“If the board wasn’t solved, how could the entrance have appeared?” Li Mo reminded her.

“That’s true. I wonder who has such chess skills...”

Tian Miao said, then looked at Ying Bing with admiration: “As expected of you, you were actually able to tell this was a game of Go.”

“Because the one who solved the board was her.”

“...”

The three of them searched the underground palace for a while longer and finally found the gate. Beside the gate were two bronze beasts, their bases engraved with numbers from ‘one’ to ‘nineteen’.

How was the first step taken again?

*Click—*

Ying Bing turned the bronze beast on the left to nine, and the one on the right to thirteen.

*Boom, rumble—*

A earth-shaking commotion came, as if the entire underground palace was trembling, like a giant Rubik’s cube being twisted by an immense force.

Then, the correct side chamber was moved towards them.

Li Mo pondered thoughtfully.

So, this labyrinth-like underground palace was a layer of insurance.

Ensuring that only the one who solved the Go board could reach the main tomb chamber?

“A tomb, to have such a masterful design.”

“I wonder how powerful the Demon Cult was back then...”

Tian Miao pondered, “At that time, they were probably still called the Summoning God Cult.”

She was very curious about what kind of existence the tomb owner was.

Because when she had just attempted to deduce, she only saw a hazy blankness.

With a loud noise, the gate opened.

Li Mo, holding the Starlight Pestle, walked at the front.

***

They traveled for an unknown length of time until they reached a place that looked like an alchemy room, though it was many times larger than the Pill Cauldron Peak of the Clear Abyss Sect.

This place was also guarded by Dream Fiends, and they were clearly different from the ones they had encountered before.

Their aura was deeper, they wore long robes, and even had white hair on their heads. Their skin had a luster to it.

From a distance, they looked almost indistinguishable from living people.

They even spoke like stewards:

“One person, one month. You can only collect one bottle of pills.”

After saying that, it lowered its head again, not specifying what kind of pills they were.

It probably meant people could choose for themselves.

From this, it seemed that as long as one wasn’t too greedy, they could come here safely and even get some benefits.

However, given the long passage of time, many of the pills had already lost their efficacy.

“Three Yuan Gathering Spirit Pill, this thing has long been extinct, yet I can see it here, and its spiritual energy is preserved exceptionally well.”

Tian Miao was very satisfied with the pill she had chosen.

“What is this one of mine?”

Originally, there weren’t many pills left with any efficacy. Li Mo had just picked one at random.

Tian Miao took a look. “Udan Pill. Eating it will give you a good night’s sleep.”

“Here.”

Ying Bing poured out the pills from the porcelain bottle in her hand. There were four in total, and she gave three to Li Mo.

“This is...” Li Mo felt the aura was a bit similar to Golden Crow Blood, but he didn’t know its specific effect.

Tian Miao’s expression was strange. “Good stuff.”

“What’s it for?”

“Strengthening yang.”

“?”
