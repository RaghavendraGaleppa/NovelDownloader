# Chapter 18: The Battlefield

"Given that sufficient supplements are required, the Fasting Pills are likely not enough; there is still a need for adequate medicinal supplements and ample food."

When Fang Mushan returned and descended into the tunnel, he swept his gaze around in surprise.

"You all plan to settle down here?"

Li Haomiao helplessly said, "He's gotten addicted to mining. He digs so fast and deep that I thought he was some kind of burrowing beast."

He tugged at his own face and gestured downwards into the tunnel with his chin.

"Take a look. He's even preparing to dig out a room inside. There might be a side room by now."

"Don't listen to his nonsense."

Xu Yunfan walked out from the tunnel, his muscles and tendons trembling slightly, instantly shaking off the dirt covering his body.

"This is for martial training. Martial arts require strength, and strength requires tempering the body. The technique I cultivate naturally requires physical exertion."

Fang Mushan nodded in approval upon hearing this. "Practicing martial arts is like sailing against the current. To advance further, one must practice diligently every day without fail. Take the one hailed as the number one martial arts genius in Yujing, Prince Yan Li Haomiao. He spends his days socializing and making friends, or admiring flowers, birds, and fish, squandering his natural talent."

Xu Yunfan coughed dryly and glanced at the corner where Li Haomiao's eyelids were twitching and he remained silent. Feeling exhausted and reaching his limit, Xu Yunfan decided to rest. He shuffled his butt over to Li Haomiao's side and poked him with his elbow.

"It seems the Prince of Yan is quite the social butterfly."

Li Haomiao didn't answer. Fang Mushan said, "That's true. The palace rumors say he wants to be the Crown Prince."

Fang Mushan lifted a rabbit he was holding.

"In these eight hundred miles of barren mountains and icy plains, it's difficult to hunt prey other than plateau sheep. This is what I painstakingly found. If I hadn't learned hunting from the hunters in my family before, I would have returned empty-handed."

Hunting?!

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred. Looking at Fang Mushan, who was processing the rabbit, he asked, "Could you teach me the method of hunting? That way, I can go out and look for prey, and the chances of obtaining food should be higher."

Fang Mushan pondered for a moment. Hunting techniques weren't exactly precious; many old hunters knew them. He nodded and agreed.

Over the next few days, as the three of them moved from place to place, Xu Yunfan would enthusiastically dig out a tunnel and pit every time.

The skill proficiency prompts that filled his vision each day were exhilarating. Especially as his proficiency increased, both the Copper Body Technique and mining became increasingly familiar to him.

Looking at the proficiency on his attribute panel, Xu Yunfan was filled with joy. According to this progress, perhaps in less than ten days or half a month—just these next two or three days—he could push the Copper Body Technique to Great Success.

At that time, he really wanted to test his strength against Yang Gan, who had achieved Great Success in Hardened Body Training.

Ningguta. In the direction Xu Yunfan had fled, Yang Gan crouched, looking at the messy footprints on the ground. His burly body had four or five large and small gashes; the blood had stained his clothes a different color, though it was unclear if it was his own or splashed from the black-clothed men.

By now, Ningguta had completely quieted down. The ground was littered with the corpses of overseers, soldiers, black-clothed men, and mining slaves.

In the center of the Ningguta depression, Lian Yuanzhang was already dead. His massive, mountain-like corpse was pinned to the ground by a coiling dragon spear. His armor had a large hole, the spear shaft pierced through his chest, and the tip was buried deep in the soil.

At his headless neck, the blood had long since stopped gushing, leaving only a pool of thick, blackened blood that stained the ground beneath him a dark brownish-red. His arms hung limply at his sides, fingers slightly curled, clearly struggling until his last breath. His legs remained in a kneeling position, unable to move an inch further.

The cold wind blew, carrying a hint of the smell of blood. A nauseating silence hung around the corpses, as if time itself had frozen. Only the clothes fluttering in the wind silently told of the fierce battle that had just taken place.

Yang Gan quickly glanced and then averted his gaze. Facing Zhang Shuyang, whose face was pale, armor stained with blood, and eyes still sharp, he dared not meet his gaze.

"General Zhang, the Prince of Yan fled in this direction."

Zhang Shuyang turned his head to look at a young girl standing not far from Lian Yuanzhang's corpse.

The girl wore a light white gauze garment, the fabric soft and misty, as if it might dissipate with the wind at any moment. She was barefoot, her jade-white toes lightly touching the blood-mixed mud without staining a speck of dust. Through the faint gauze, one could vaguely see her graceful figure, yet it evoked no seduction, only a sense of mystery and inviolability. Her face was breathtakingly beautiful but devoid of blood, her lips pale, and her eyes cold as a winter star.

She stood there quietly, exuding a chill that kept others at bay. The air around her seemed to freeze, making people afraid to approach easily, sending chills down one's spine.

She was a terrifying woman.

This person had beheaded Lian Yuanzhang with a single move just moments ago. A master on the verge of entering the Muscle Refining realm was easily decapitated; her strength was unfathomable.

She was from the Tiance Mansion, Li Miaojun. It was said she was a member of a secret organization under the Empress.

Zhang Shuyang's thoughts raced. He quickly withdrew his gaze, dared not look more, lowered his eyes, and cupped his fists.

"Commander Li, the Prince of Yan had inconvenient limbs and was carried away on the back of a former servant of the Jiang family, fleeing in this direction."

Whether to pursue or wait was no longer up to Zhang Shuyang to decide; it required the girl to speak.

After a long while, Li Miaojun moved her gaze from Lian Yuanzhang's corpse and turned to look at Zhang Shuyang.

Being stared at by those eyes, Zhang Shuyang felt a chill in his heart, his heart pounding wildly, and he quickly lowered his head.

"Find him. He is now the only remaining bloodline of the late Emperor. Her Majesty needs him."

The voice, as cold as if she did not eat the烟火 of the mortal world, entered Zhang Shuyang's ears, shaking his spirit. He quickly responded.

"Yes!"

When he looked up, Li Miaojun had already vanished from the scene like a ghost.

Zhang Shuyang fell silent, his expression extremely complex. The imperial bloodline, now only Li Haomiao remains...

After a long time, he touched his aching chest and slowly regulated his breathing. He had been hit hard by Lian Yuanzhang's desperate counterattack and suffered considerable injuries. If Li Miaojun hadn't出手, he might have been the one lying on the battlefield.

Moreover, their side suffered heavy losses. Too many people had gathered at Ningguta, involving multiple forces, and many mysterious experts had joined the fray. If Li Miaojun hadn't scared them off, they might have been wiped out.

He turned back to look at Yang Gan.

"Since you just said you know tracking, I will grant you thirty elite soldiers. If you bring the Prince of Yan back, I will record it as a merit for you."
