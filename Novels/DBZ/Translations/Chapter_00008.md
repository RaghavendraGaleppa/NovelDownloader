# Chapter 8: Summoned by the Elder  

Many members of the Li Clan were eagerly anticipating the upcoming auction, but Wei Qian found himself lacking enthusiasm.  

It couldn’t be helped—after all, he only had a few spirit stones to his name. Among the items showcased at the auction, which one could he possibly afford?  

Moreover, the term "auction" was practically drenched in the blood of cultivators. Every time an auction was held, it attracted swarms of rogue cultivators looking to plunder. Sometimes, winning a bid was the easy part—getting the item safely back home was the real challenge.  

From Wei Qian’s observations during his days as a wandering cultivator, the mortality rate at some auctions wasn’t much lower than exploring ancient ruins or secret realms.  

Though he had no intention of participating, he never expected that someone would set their sights on him.  

---  

At the summit of Misty Ridge, inside the Li Clan’s grand hall, Clan Leader Li Wanlong and the clan elders were discussing arrangements for the auction a month later.  

"This time, we should include some of our younger generation in the auction delegation," Li Wanlong suggested, his gaze lingering on Elder Li Wanqing.  

Beneath the clan leader, the Li Clan had six elders, and Li Wanqing was the youngest among them—one of only two with the potential to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage.  

"Indeed," Li Wanqing chimed in, drawing the attention of the others. "The clan leader speaks wisely. My own unworthy son should also be sent out to gain experience and broaden his horizons."  

"Quite right, quite right," the other five elders echoed in agreement.  

Soon, the list of participants for the auction delegation was finalized. As Li Wanlong reviewed the names, one in particular caught his eye.  

Amidst the sea of Li Clan cultivators, the name "Wei Qian" stood out conspicuously. A quick glance revealed that Wei Qian had been recommended by Li Wanqing.  

*When did this kid get involved with Li Wanqing?* The thought flickered briefly in the clan leader’s mind before he dismissed it.  

After all, Wei Qian was just a measly second-level Qi Refining cultivator—hardly worth much thought.  

---  

Wei Qian, meanwhile, remained blissfully unaware of the assignment that had been arranged for him.  

That afternoon, Li Guchen paid him a visit, informing him that his father—Elder Li Wanqing—wished to see him.  

*Why would Elder Li want to meet me?* Wei Qian was puzzled, but Li Guchen couldn’t provide any answers.  

*Well, I’ll find out soon enough.*  

At Elder Li Wanqing’s cave abode on Misty Ridge, the elder spoke in a tone that brooked no argument:  

"A month from now, the Flowing Cloud Sect and the Xiao Clan will jointly host an auction at the Wang Clan’s Blackwater Pond."  

"The clan has decided to include younger members like Guchen in the delegation—it’ll serve as valuable experience for them."  

"But I don’t trust that boy to behave. You, on the other hand, are steady and reliable—qualities I admire. I want you to accompany Guchen and keep him in check."  

Wei Qian was stunned. Of all things, Elder Li had summoned him to participate in the very auction he wanted to avoid!  

His first instinct was to refuse, but Li Wanqing was an eighth-level Qi Refining cultivator and the elder overseeing the Li Clan’s spirit herb gardens. Directly rejecting him wasn’t an option.  

After a moment’s thought, Wei Qian carefully replied, "The Li Clan is a prestigious cultivation family. Surely, the auction delegation will be led by experienced seniors. What use would a minor cultivator like me be?"  

Li Wanqing nodded approvingly. "Precisely—that’s the attitude I appreciate."  

He continued, "Naturally, our clan will send elders to oversee the delegation, but they’ll be responsible for the entire group. It’s impossible for them to watch over every individual."  

"Your task is simply to accompany Guchen."  

Perhaps anticipating further excuses, Li Wanqing preemptively addressed them: "I’ve already discussed this with the clan leader, and he’s agreed."  

"As for the spirit fields, don’t worry—I’ll instruct the old man to take extra care of them."  

Of course, as a seasoned elder, Li Wanqing understood the importance of incentives.  

He tossed Wei Qian a low-grade storage pouch.  

"Inside, you’ll find twenty low-grade spirit stones and a bottle of twelve Yellow Sprout Pills—they’ll aid your cultivation. For the next month, I’ll also permit you to cultivate in my cave abode."  

"That should be enough for you to advance further."  

Knowing that Wei Qian had been diligently cultivating since joining the Li Clan as a tenant farmer, Li Wanqing dangled these rewards as bait.  

The combination of pressure and incentives was undeniably effective. Realizing that further refusal would only bring trouble, Wei Qian clasped his hands and bowed.  

"Since Elder Wanqing thinks so highly of me, I’ll respectfully comply."  

---  

Exiting the elder’s cave, Wei Qian wore a bitter smile.  

*Who would’ve thought I’d be conscripted because I’m too steady and reliable? What a joke.*  

But he had no power to refuse. Returning to his quarters, he packed his belongings and immediately moved into Li Wanqing’s cave.  

*The auction can wait—it’s still a month away. Right now, I should make the most of this upper-tier first-grade spirit vein.*  

The difference in quality was astounding. After just half an hour of meditation, Wei Qian could already feel the effects—his cultivation speed was one and a half times faster than before.  

*If only I could cultivate at the peak of Misty Ridge, where the second-grade spirit vein is...* The thought flickered in his mind, but he quickly dismissed it.  

*No point dreaming. That’s where the Li Clan’s Foundation Establishment ancestor cultivates. There’s no way someone like me would ever get access.*  

Shaking off the distraction, he retrieved a small white jade vial from the storage pouch and poured out a golden-yellow pill.  

A mere whiff of its medicinal fragrance invigorated his spirit.  

*So this is a Yellow Sprout Pill? I’ve heard that scions of major cultivation clans treat these like candy, yet this is my first time seeing one!*  

For once, a trace of envy surfaced in Wei Qian’s eyes. *With resources like these, even someone with inferior spiritual roots like me could reach the late stages of Qi Refining.*  

*Step by step, I’ll climb higher—first to the late Qi Refining stage, then attempt Foundation Establishment!*  

In this world, with the possibility of immortality and ascension within reach, how could he not strive for it?  

Without hesitation, Wei Qian swallowed the pill. As the medicinal energy unfurled within him, he focused his mind and began refining it.  

Cycle after cycle, hundreds of circulations later, most of the pill’s energy had been converted into a surging stream of spiritual power, churning within his dantian.  

With his mid-grade spiritual roots, the upper-tier first-grade spirit vein, days of rigorous cultivation, and the boost from the Yellow Sprout Pill, Wei Qian could feel it—  

*The bottleneck to the third level of Qi Refining!*
