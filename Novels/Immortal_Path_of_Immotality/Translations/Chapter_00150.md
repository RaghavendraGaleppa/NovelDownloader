# Chapter 149: Soaring Ancient Rhyme

In the depths of the imperial treasury, a colossal black lotus Buddha statue sat in serene silence. 

The benevolent-faced Buddha sat in meditation, one hand forming a mudra, its twelve-petal black lotus throne dark as ink. It was unclear whether the Black Lotus Sect had fabricated this deity or if it truly existed somewhere—whether in the mortal realm or, like the Buddha himself, in the celestial planes.

Lin Shan suppressed his excitement with difficulty. Back in Zangke County of the Southern Borderlands, when he was merely at the Huanqi stage of the Postnatal realm, he had learned that the giant black lotus Buddha statue unearthed from the Yelang ancient tomb had been purchased by a noble from the capital. After years of chasing leads to the imperial city and dreaming of this moment, he had finally laid eyes on the real thing.

He stepped forward and gently touched the statue. The transparent enhancement panel appeared as expected.

**[Black Lotus Buddha Statue]**  
Quality: Common  
Ancient Rhyme: 32 points  
Absorb?  

...  

"Absorb!"

The ten-foot-tall statue crumbled instantly, collapsing into a pile of dust like a sand sculpture.

Lin Shan's heart raced. His Ancient Rhyme had now surged back to a staggering **106 points**! Not only was this enough to purchase the elixirs needed to advance to the mid Foundation Establishment stage, but it also left plenty to enhance another spirit treasure.

"I can't just hoard this much Ancient Rhyme—I need to convert it into strength immediately," he muttered to himself. "Once the Battle of Bianliang concludes, I'll request a transfer back to the Eastern Sea to cultivate!"

He no longer saw the need to continue fighting. With the dozen or so bottles of "Cloudrise Pills" from Qi Zhong of the Dry Cloud Pavilion and the "Azurefall Pills" he could exchange for his military merits from the Black Lotus Sect, he had more than enough resources to reach the peak of early Foundation Establishment. 

Then, using the Ancient Rhyme to break through his bottleneck, he could directly ascend to mid Foundation Establishment.

Though the demonic path currently held the upper hand in the ongoing war—having breached the Violet Sky Sect's defenses in the central theater and even captured the Great Song's capital, Bianliang—the righteous sects had entrenched themselves in the western territories for millennia. They wouldn't be so easily eradicated.

A far bloodier final confrontation was inevitable.

At his current Foundation Establishment level, he would still be little more than cannon fodder in that battle, with a high risk of perishing. Why not withdraw while he was ahead and focus on strengthening himself?

As the Clean Altar Envoy, his role was primarily logistical. His presence or absence on the frontlines wouldn't make much difference. If he requested a transfer back to the Eastern Sea, the United Command likely wouldn't bother stopping him.

Even if the three demonic sects eventually conquered the entire Great Song, it would likely take decades. He could always return later if he needed more cultivation resources—there was no need to rush.

As Lin Shan pondered his future plans, he casually browsed the imperial treasury. The mundane treasures held no interest for him, but the antique paintings and calligraphy scrolls proved to be an unexpected boon.

---

**"Autumn Scenery by the Stream"**  
**"Nine Cauldrons and the Goddess of the Luo River"**  
**"Calligraphy by Liu Gongming"**  
**"Unfurling Scrolls by the Windy Eaves"**  
**"Spring Harmony by Huiming"**  

...  

Lin Shan picked up and examined scroll after scroll. Some remained intact, while others crumbled to dust at his touch. 

Within a quarter-hour, his Ancient Rhyme had skyrocketed to **128 points**!

"Finally, I can indulge in some spending spree," he thought eagerly. No matter how much Ancient Rhyme he stockpiled, the enhancement panel wouldn't pay interest. As long as he kept enough for emergencies, the rest could—and should—be converted into power as soon as possible.

Only by growing stronger could he secure more Ancient Rhyme, creating a virtuous cycle.

---

Emerging from the fake mountain concealing the treasury, Lin Shan noticed numerous shadowy figures lurking nearby—new waves of demonic cultivators scouring the area. 

He paid them no mind. With his Ancient Rhyme secured, there was no need to stir up trouble. Tugging his hat lower, he swiftly flew out of the palace grounds.

Outside, the fighting had dwindled to sporadic skirmishes. The righteous cultivators appeared to be in full retreat, fleeing the capital in disarray while demonic cultivators chased after them with wild abandon.

Opportunism was second nature to the demonic path. In adversity, they faltered; in triumph, their combat prowess tripled. 

*If you stand and fight, I might hesitate. But if you run? I'll chase you to the ends of the earth!*

Walking through the ruined streets, Lin Shan observed a peculiar phenomenon: groups of Qi Condensation demonic cultivators howling as they pursued solitary Foundation Establishment righteous cultivators.

*Where did they get the courage?* he wondered. *Don't they fear the righteous cultivators turning around and slaughtering them?*

In truth, the fleeing cultivators dared not retaliate. Initially, some had fought back, cutting down their pursuers in droves. But they soon realized that the low-ranking demonic cultivators seemed to share a single brain cell: 

*If you run, we chase—no matter who you are!*

Exhausted from killing, the righteous cultivators eventually gave up. It wasn't worth delaying their escape to exterminate these weaklings. Once outside the city, the open skies would be theirs—let the pursuers do as they pleased.

---

Lin Shan searched the mansions of various princes, hoping to find more antiques, but they had already been picked clean by demonic rogue cultivators. 

*Locusts leave no blade of grass behind.*

Resigned, he visited the "Earl of Bowang's residence," only to find the Nightingale headquarters in ruins. Surprisingly, few corpses littered the ground—the entire Nightingale organization had vanished without a trace.

Lin Shan sighed in relief. The Nightingale's Elder and Protector Jiang must have evacuated in advance. At least he wouldn't need to worry about them.

After several more rounds through the city, he finally located his puppet chariot—only to find the Black Bone Demon Lord, Old Man Zhong, and their crew whooping as they chased down a righteous Foundation Establishment cultivator.

The two puppet steeds panted heavily, their mid-grade spirit stone slots dimming—clearly drained from joyriding around Bianliang.

*Well, it's not my money they're burning. Free road trip for them!*

Lin Shan nearly choked on his anger. Not only were they squandering his resources, but they were also flaunting a high-grade magical artifact in public! Even if righteous cultivators ignored them, didn't they fear being robbed by fellow demonic practitioners?

*I left the chariot to ensure their safety, and this is how they repay me? Instead of hiding, they're parading around hunting Foundation Establishment cultivators! Do they have a death wish?*

But his subordinates had caught the prevailing demonic fervor. In such a one-sided victory, it was easy to lose oneself. With enemies fleeing everywhere and everyone joining the chase, the collective hysteria was contagious.

Bolstered by the high-grade artifact and pooling their Qi Condensation powers—along with the inscrutable Black Bone Demon Lord—they could barely restrain their prey. The thrill of weaker cultivators hunting a stronger one was intoxicating, especially for those of the demonic path, where discipline was nonexistent.

The demonic cultivators' golden core elders were too preoccupied to intervene, allowing free rein for pillaging and slaughter. Some might even be wolves in sheep's clothing.

The young Foundation Establishment cultivator they pursued appeared timid and inexperienced, too afraid to take to the skies and instead weaving through the crowds—a perfect target for Lin Shan's ragtag band.

Particularly grating were the taunts from the Black Bone Demon Lord and Old Man Zhong, whose banter even made Lin Shan cringe.

"Hey kid, stop running! Fight your Grandpa Zhong for three hundred rounds if you've got the guts!"  
"Keke! Yeah, you! What's wrong, scaredy-cat?"  
"I promise not to use my trump-card mid-grade artifact. Now dare you face me?"  
"No mid-grade artifacts? Old man, you're getting cocky!"  
"You're just a baby Foundation Establishment cultivator, while I, at my age, have reached late Qi Condensation! Tremble before me!"  
"Gasp! Late Qi Condensation—terrifying!"  
The chorus chimed in: "Terrifying!"  

---

Unable to endure the mockery, the young righteous cultivator finally snapped. 

"Fine! You asked for it!"  
"A foul-mouthed skeleton and a senile fool! And a bunch of brain-dead morons!"  
"Die, all of you!"  

He could have attacked immediately, but his pride demanded he return the insults first—as if withholding them would make his skin crawl with ants.

Yet before he could strike, a barrage of high-grade artifacts—rings, jade bracelets, and a miniature pagoda—rained down, pinning him to the ground.

The mob on the chariot cheered, brandishing their low-grade weapons and stabbing through the pagoda's windows at the trapped cultivator. 

Helpless, the young man could only watch as the rabble cursed and stabbed at him until, in a fit of rage, he fainted.

---

Three days later, the Battle of Bianliang concluded, and cleanup operations wrapped up.

The city and its surroundings lay in smoldering ruins, with demonic flames still licking at some areas. Yet a new camp housing over a hundred thousand troops had sprung up, gathering 80% of the central theater's forces. 

The Black Lotus cultivators buzzed with excitement, eager for their next orders from the United Command.

To celebrate their victory, the high command hosted a grand feast. Tables groaned with spirit fruits and wines as the demonic cultivators toasted their triumph, their laughter ringing through the camp as they dreamed of future conquests.

Lin Shan skipped the festivities. Instead, he queued at the military logistics office outside the city, where a long line of demonic cultivators waited to report their missions and exchange merits for sect contribution points.

"Black Lotus Sect Clean Altar Envoy, Lin Shan."  

**Contributions:**  
- Eastern Sea Mission Residual: 200 points  
- Scouting Burial Poison Canyon: 2,000 points  
- Assault on Canyon Stronghold: 1,000 points  
- Slaying Cangxuan Sect Foundation Establishment Deacon: 2,000 points  
- Slaying Dry Cloud Pavilion True Disciple: 8,000 points  
- Capturing Autumn Maple Valley Young Master: 4,000 points  
- Participation in Siege of Bianliang: 1,000 points  

**Total: 18,200 points!**  

With this, Lin Shan's path to greater power was assured.
