# Chapter 239: Sweeping Through  

Li Shiming's mood was rather peculiar at the moment. He found himself eagerly anticipating Young Master Hang's attack so he could rightfully seize the two third-grade Five Elements formation materials—one metal-attribute and one fire-attribute, both of exceptional purity.  

As a righteous cultivator, unlike his demonic counterpart Li Yuanba from the Netherworld Sect, he couldn't simply rob someone outright. If it were Li Yuanba here, he wouldn't hesitate—demonic cultivators didn't care about reputation.  

Li Shiming activated a small device he had recently developed—a miniature surveillance probe connected to a jade slip. It recorded data in a format readable by spiritual sense, eliminating the need for decoding. This was his insurance, ensuring he had evidence to justify his actions if the Hang family's Golden Core cultivator came knocking.  

"I don't even know your name, but it doesn’t matter. A few of your friends are waiting for you here!" Young Master Hang's smile vanished, replaced by a sinister glare as the third-floor isolation formation activated, sealing the room.  

Six figures emerged from the inner chamber, led by Ji Hongbo, whose cold gaze regarded Li Shiming as if he were already a corpse. In Ji Hongbo's eyes, an alchemist like Li Shiming couldn’t possibly be strong—just a mid-stage Foundation Building cultivator facing five late-stage Foundation Building experts.  

Ji Hongbo had handpicked these five powerful fighters to ensure Li Shiming’s capture. Killing him wasn’t the plan; Ji Hongbo wanted to imprison him and force him to refine pills. If Li Shiming resisted, torture would break him.  

"Junior Brother Li, though this is our first meeting, I’ve long admired you," Ji Hongbo said with arrogance.  

"Fellow disciples of the Shu Mountain Sect—you’re from Elder Ji’s faction?" Li Shiming immediately recognized their affiliation. His only conflict within the sect was with Elder Ji’s faction, whom he had thwarted in their attempt to delay his master Elder Su’s recovery. He had thought the matter resolved, but now they had cornered him.

**"I am Ji Hongbo. I assume you’ve heard of me."** Ji Hongbo wasn’t in a hurry to attack. With five late-stage Foundation Building cultivators surrounding Li Shiming, he smirked and introduced himself.  

"Ah, Senior Brother Ji. Did you inform this Brother Hang of my identity?" Li Shiming remained unfazed. He turned to the cowering Young Master Hang and said coldly, "My name is Li Shiming, a true disciple of the Shu Mountain Sect’s alchemy lineage. Congratulations—you’ve just made a grave mistake."  

Young Master Hang’s face turned ashen at the name. A true disciple of alchemy? He was doomed. If he had known, he would never have agreed to help Ji Hongbo.  

Li Shiming’s presence in the market had been widely noticed. Attacking him—a rising star in alchemy—was tantamount to slapping the Shu Mountain Sect in the face. The sect’s retaliation would be swift and merciless.  

Young Master Hang’s eyes darted to Ji Hongbo in terror. His mind cleared—Ji Hongbo would never let him, a witness, survive this.  

"Brother Hang, don’t worry. I’ll handle everything. You’ll be fine," Ji Hongbo said darkly, not wanting any complications. The third-floor formation still required Hang’s cooperation.  

"Of course, I trust you," Hang Yuxing replied, though his eyes flickered with panic as he searched for an escape.  

Ji Hongbo stepped beside him, placing a hand on his shoulder—a silent threat. Hang Yuxing didn’t dare resist.  

"Junior Brother Li, your little speech didn’t work," Ji Hongbo sneered before nodding to his men.  

Five late-stage Foundation Building cultivators unleashed their magic tools.  

"Strike!" Li Shiming commanded. Nine flying swords shot out. He didn’t bother with formations—he used them purely as weapons.  

The central sword targeted one cultivator, while the remaining eight split between the other four.  

After refining ten cauldrons of pills simultaneously, his multitasking had reached an inhuman level. He held nothing back—his surveillance ensured he had proof.  

Though his sword intent was weaker than Li Yuanba’s, his "Purple Qi from the East" cultivation had infused it with lightning. The fusion made his strikes like needles, piercing defenses effortlessly.  

When his swords clashed with his enemies’ magic tools, his sword intent created a tiny fissure, allowing his thunderous spiritual power to flood in and disable their weapons instantly.  

His opponents had no prior knowledge of his abilities. If they had, they would’ve prepared countermeasures.  

The battle ended as quickly as it began. Ji Hongbo’s smirk froze as his five subordinates fell in an instant.  

Silence. Terror thickened the air. Ji Hongbo’s scalp prickled with cold sweat.  

He was only an early-stage Foundation Building cultivator. At best, he could match one of the fallen. Yet Li Shiming had slaughtered five late-stage experts effortlessly.  

Had he known, he would’ve brought reinforcements—or better yet, let his father, Elder Ji, handle this.  

"Quick, take me into the formation! I need time to prepare, or we’re both dead!" Ji Hongbo hissed, gripping Hang Yuxing’s arm.  

Hang Yuxing, stunned, obeyed, retreating into the formation’s protective range.  

Li Shiming watched with disdain. In a flash, he appeared before Hang Yuxing. His sword was faster—Hang’s head snapped back as the blade pierced his skull.  

Ji Hongbo stood frozen, a talisman treasure in hand. Even if he activated it, he couldn’t escape the formation in time.  

"Junior Brother Li, spare me! I swear I’ll never oppose you again!" he pleaded, forcing a smile.  

"Do you really think that’s possible?" Li Shiming’s nine swords hummed with lethal intent.  

"My father will avenge me!"  

"That’s true. Surrender, and I’ll spare your life. Otherwise, face my swords."  

Ji Hongbo’s survival instinct won. He dropped his defenses, letting his magic tools clatter to the ground.  

Li Shiming’s central sword flashed. Ji Hongbo gasped—he wasn’t dead, but his dantian had been shattered. His cultivation crumbled to nothing.  

"You destroyed my foundation!" he shrieked, his voice weak as a mortal’s.  

"I spared you out of respect for your status as a true disciple. You’ll face the sect’s judgment," Li Shiming said coldly.  

Handing Ji Hongbo over to the sect would ruin Elder Ji’s reputation, securing Elder Su’s path to Nascent Soul.  

Ji Hongbo fell silent, plotting his defense. With his father’s influence, he might still turn the tables. As for his cultivation—he could rebuild it in a few years.  

Li Shiming’s spiritual sense swept over him. He took Ji Hongbo’s storage bracelet, talisman treasure, and defensive magic tools.  

Ji Hongbo’s heart ached. That bracelet contained treasures he’d begged from his ancestor—irreplaceable.
