**Chapter 23: Innate Primordial Qi Myriad Spirits Banner**

Above the sea of clouds, Liu Xin proactively tried to de-escalate: "If the two junior brothers are willing to turn this conflict into camaraderie, I, Liu, would gladly offer a supreme Daoist scripture as a gift."

"Now? Are you jesting?" Lu Yang chuckled at his words. "Senior Brother Liu, we are all disciples of the Saint Sect. Why play games? You've already made an irreconcilable enemy of us."

Liu Xin didn't answer, his face suddenly sinking. Because Lu Yang was right; at this moment, the ones truly unwilling to reconcile were no longer Lu Yang and Xiao Shiye, but Liu Xin and Fairy Qingchen. The reason was simple: the Saint Sect's rules.

"While the Saint Sect's rules are effectively toothless as long as one isn't caught, once discovered, they become very real indeed," Lu Yang sneered. "You people have surely ambushed and plundered fellow disciples more than once; it's just that no one discovered it before. But now, if I leave and report you to the Enforcement Hall, the truth will come out, and Senior Brother Liu, you will almost certainly face certain death."

"Junior Brother, you jest." Liu Xin's face twitched imperceptibly. "You and I can sign a spiritual pact, swearing that today's events will not be spread to a sixth ear. That way, I, your Senior Brother, would naturally be at ease—"

"Really?" Lu Yang countered.

Of course, it was false. Only the dead are truly trustworthy!

"Qingchen!" Liu Xin barked. Fairy Qingchen, who had remained silent by his side, finally spoke. Her vermilion lips parted slightly, and she slowly uttered a single syllable: "Open!"

Before her voice faded, the surrounding sea of clouds transformed again, instantly manifesting towering, majestic peaks that trapped Lu Yang and Xiao Shiye in their center. Evidently, it was another formation!

"Do you really think I'm afraid of your Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light?" Liu Xin, surprisingly recognizing Lu Yang's divine ability, sneered. A fluttering banner then appeared in his hand. "It just so happens that my 'Innate Primordial Qi Myriad Spirits Banner' lacks a principal soul to reside within. Today, I'll use you as a sacrifice to consecrate it—"

"Go!" Before Liu Xin could finish speaking, Lu Yang, his body merging with his Sword Core, already came flying, slashing through the air. The overwhelming bloody stench instantly made Liu Xin swallow his unfinished taunt.

"Souls, return!" Liu Xin chanted a spell, vigorously shaking the Myriad Spirits Banner in his hand. Instantly, two wisps of ethereal white qi emanated, gradually manifesting into human figures as they billowed upwards.

Lu Yang continued his motion, slashing down with his sword. The two figures, under Liu Xin's command, likewise circulated their true qi, fiercely meeting the attack. Then, with a 'boom,' they were shattered by the sword qi.

Liu Xin was just about to go out and join forces with the two banner spirits he had summoned to face the enemy, but seeing this, he immediately shrank back.

"Qingchen, quickly act!" Fairy Qingchen's pretty face grew solemn at his words. She removed a phoenix-tail hairpin from her hair and threw it. The hairpin instantly transformed into a golden beam of light, darting towards Lu Yang's glabella.

However, before the phoenix-tail hairpin could approach Lu Yang, another treasure light appeared out of thin air, blocking it. It was none other than Xiao Shiye, the 'Treasure-Hoarding Prodigy'.

But that wasn't all. Xiao Shiye, with a flick of his sleeve, instantly flung out over ten magic treasures. Though their quality varied, some good, some bad, every single one emitted an intense treasure light. And astonishingly, after he unleashed them, these treasures directly exploded with a thunderous roar in mid-air!

"Boom! Boom! Boom!" The exploding treasure lights were like miniature suns, directly obstructing the killing formation set by Fairy Qingchen, even threatening to blast the formation open from within!

Such an extravagant display caused the other three to twitch at the corners of their eyes.

While Xiao Shiye was indeed different from Lu Yang, possessing no formidable spells or divine abilities, he clearly had no need for such ostentatious tricks when battling others. All he had to do was fling out his magic treasures and detonate them; that was enough.

This tactic made Liu Xin's already grim face even more unsightly. He simply waved the Myriad Spirits Banner in his hand, instantly summoning dozens of banner spirits. These were all Liu Xin's gains from ambushing and killing fellow disciples during this period.

"All of you, go reinforce the formation." Upon receiving Liu Xin's command, the host of banner spirits immediately moved, taking positions around Fairy Qingchen's formation, bolstering its power.

Seeing this, Fairy Qingchen felt greatly reassured. A small flag appeared in her hand, which she then shook vigorously. The towering peaks manifested by the formation around them immediately responded, locking down heaven and earth, sealing off all four directions, while also firmly protecting her and Liu Xin, blocking Lu Yang's sword light.

Liu Xin smiled in satisfaction at the sight, then shook the Myriad Spirits Banner again.

This wondrous treasure was obtained during a fortuitous encounter of his, alongside the 'Innate Daoist Scripture'. It was his greatest reliance in combat throughout his cultivation to date. The banner was said to be comprised of one principal soul, two protectors, and three corpse gods. It was said that the Dao gave birth to one, one gave birth to two, two gave birth to three, and three gave birth to myriad things. Only by filling these six positions, combined with ten thousand souls, would this treasure be considered complete.

It sounded simple, yet Liu Xin had painstakingly refined it for over a decade without success. Ten thousand souls were easily acquired; he could simply take some time to slaughter a city in the mortal realm. However, the six most crucial positions had always remained vacant; let alone the two protectors, he hadn't even gathered the three corpse gods.

Nevertheless, even so, the power of this treasure was still considerable.

"Kill them!" Liu Xin waved the banner, and ten thousand souls flew out one after another. Unlike those banner spirits with cultivation, these souls were vengeful specters formed from the grievances of mortals. Although their quality was poor, their numbers were immense.

Summoned by Liu Xin at this moment, they truly resembled a towering tidal wave, a vast, dark swarm covering everything, instantly submerging Lu Yang's figure. More importantly, these were fleshless vengeful spirits, completely unafraid of Lu Yang's Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light!

However, seeing this, Lu Yang remained utterly fearless. The Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light was his most potent technique, but it wasn't his only one. After refining his Sword Core, his Divine Firmament Sword Mastery True Art also possessed formidable power!

With a thought from Lu Yang, the Sword Core rapidly split into dozens, even hundreds, of sword lights. His figure then began to teleport and maneuver amidst the sword lights, refusing to engage the vengeful specter banner spirits head-on. When the enemy advanced, he retreated; when the enemy tired, he attacked. He actually began fighting a guerrilla war with the host of banner spirits. This was the true advantage of a Sword Cultivator. A single sword strike would send him fleeing a thousand miles away, then he would attack again from another direction, leaving his opponents weary and exposing their flaws, finally beheading them with one last strike.

Before long, the ten thousand vengeful specters were scattered and routed by Lu Yang's slaughter.

On the other side, Xiao Shiye also turned ruthless, throwing out several supreme magic treasures that ferociously self-detonated, making the painstakingly stabilized grand formation violently unstable once more.

Seeing the situation gradually turn unfavorable, Fairy Qingchen couldn't help but look at Liu Xin: "Senior Brother—"

"Don't rush. I'm not rushing, so why are you?" Liu Xin remained calm. Xiao Shiye aside, he didn't believe Lu Yang could unleash such a massacre with his Sword Escape technique without any expenditure of true qi or magic power. This was also his combat tactic. First, release the less important banner spirits to wear down the opponent, and once the opponent's true qi was almost depleted, then bring out the trump card to decisively secure victory.

In truth, if it weren't absolutely necessary, he didn't want to use his trump card. After all, that particular banner spirit was simply too valuable, and its identity in life was incredibly sensitive. Once seen by anyone, no survivors could be left, otherwise, even a hint of it getting out could doom him to eternal damnation.

"Very well, one cannot catch a wolf without sacrificing a cub." Liu Xin pondered for a moment, then finally raised the banner in his hand and bowed respectfully: "A powerful enemy has arrived. To resolve this predicament, I implore Senior Brother to make your move."
