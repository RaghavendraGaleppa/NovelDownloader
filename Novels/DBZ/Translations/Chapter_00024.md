# Chapter 24: Storming Blackwind Ridge  

A mountain range stretching tens of thousands of miles ran east to west across the entire Zhao Kingdom's cultivation world.  

This range, teeming with countless demonic beasts, was aptly named the "Demonic Beast Mountains." Numerous branches extended outward from the main range, and among them, Blackwind Ridge was one of the most inconspicuous.  

Due to its sparse spiritual energy, Blackwind Ridge was absent from the maps of the Demonic Beast Mountains drawn by major sects and cultivation families.  

However, just because the sects and families disregarded it didn’t mean rogue cultivators would. For even this meager spiritual energy, fierce conflicts frequently erupted among the rogue cultivators, and Blackwind Ridge often changed hands.  

At present, the temporary rulers of Blackwind Ridge were the "Three Bloodthirsty Sangs."  

Originally descendants of a minor cultivation family, the three brothers became rogue cultivators after their family dissolved. Bound by blood ties, they naturally stuck together, carving out a reputation for themselves through ruthless violence among the rogue cultivators—earning them their infamous moniker.  

Far from feeling ashamed, the brothers took pride in their notoriety. To them, being feared was far better than being looked down upon.  

But life as rogue cultivators was hard.  

Once all three brothers reached the mid-stage of Qi Refinement, they quickly realized that Blackwind Ridge could no longer sustain their cultivation. Thus, they set their sights on the rogue cultivator's holy land—Black Flood Dragon Immortal City—located near the Demonic Beast Mountains.  

Dangerous yet rich in opportunities, Black Flood Dragon Immortal City was a place where rumors of rogue cultivators achieving Foundation Establishment circulated every few decades.  

However, living there was no easy feat. Without sufficient spirit stones or willingness to serve one of the city’s factions, they’d be driven out.  

To amass enough wealth, the three brothers decided to pull off a major heist—hence the kidnapping of Lu Ping, Bai Fugui’s friend.  

---  

Wei Qian and Bai Fugui arrived on horseback, gazing up at the treacherous terrain of Blackwind Ridge, where eerie winds howled intermittently.  

A gust of the chilling wind sent a shiver down Bai Fugui’s spine, his momentary courage dwindling by thirty percent. At this rate, by the time they actually attempted the rescue, his bravery would likely be reduced to a mere ten percent.  

Taking him along would be more of a hindrance than help.  

Moreover, Wei Qian preferred to keep some of his methods hidden.  

"Wait here," Wei Qian said bluntly.  

Bai Fugui hesitated. "Can you handle this alone?"  

Even now, his trust in Wei Qian was shaky.  

Wei Qian frowned. "If you sought my help, you should at least have some faith in me."  

"This will be settled within a day."  

Without another word, Wei Qian entered Blackwind Ridge alone.  

Once inside, he slowed his pace deliberately.  

Half an hour later, he reached the outskirts of the ridge’s most spiritually abundant area.  

"As expected, no formation arrays here."  

This aligned with Wei Qian’s prediction.  

Formation arrays, despite being among the most powerful and versatile of cultivation arts, were prohibitively expensive—not just to acquire but also to maintain. The meager ambient spiritual energy could only sustain their most basic functions; proper operation required additional spirit stones.  

Even cultivation families considered formations "affordable to buy but too costly to use," let alone three impoverished rogue cultivators who resorted to kidnapping.  

Still, caution was paramount.  

What if they had stumbled upon some fortuitous encounter?  

Wei Qian studied a distant manor on the ridge, his mind racing. "No formations, but they must have other warning measures."  

Based on his own experience as a rogue cultivator, it was likely either tamed beasts or alarm talismans—the latter being more probable, given that the Sang brothers currently held a talisman master captive.  

"Alarm talismans ignite upon detecting mana fluctuations, emitting a bright flash as a warning," Wei Qian recalled.  

"Assuming the Sangs’ talismans are upper-tier first-grade, their detection range would be about a hundred zhang."  

Even if they hadn’t set them up before, they certainly would have now. Wei Qian was certain the brothers weren’t foolish enough to forgo having Lu Ping craft a few.  

---  

With that in mind, Wei Qian shifted his focus away from the manor.  

Undoubtedly, all three brothers were inside.  

"Even with my current strength, charging in head-on would give me decent odds of success. But I prefer a more cautious approach."  

He retreated slowly, formulating a plan to lure one of the brothers out.  

Outside Blackwind Ridge, Bai Fugui hid behind a boulder, waiting anxiously. After about forty-five minutes, a plume of black smoke rose from the ridge.  

"Someone set a fire?" Bai Fugui tensed. Had the confrontation already begun?  

Who was winning? Who was losing?  

*Heaven help us, let it be Wei Qian...* the plump man prayed silently.  

---  

On the ridge, the Sang brothers soon noticed the smoke.  

The eldest, Sang Da, was the first to react. "What’s going on? Who’s setting fires?"  

The flames spread rapidly, clearly directed—unnatural.  

"Big brother, could it be someone coming to rescue that kid?" Sang Er asked nervously.  

"We’ve investigated him thoroughly. He’s a rogue cultivator with no close friends. Unlikely," Sang Da dismissed.  

"More probably, an old enemy seeking revenge."  

The brothers had made plenty of enemies over the years, and vengeful confrontations weren’t uncommon. But setting the mountain ablaze? That was a first.  

"Whoever it is, they’re dead for daring to provoke us," Sang Da sneered.  

Perfect timing—they’d recently upgraded their defensive measures. If they could eliminate a foe before fleeing to Black Flood Dragon Immortal City, all the better.  

He pulled out a stack of talismans, handing half to Sang Er.  

"Tell San to stay behind. The two of us will deal with this intruder!"
