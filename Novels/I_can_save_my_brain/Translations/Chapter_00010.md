# Chapter 10: Spiritual Vein  

**"Boom! Boom! Boom!"**  

As the formation patterns on the boulder activated, the stone wall slowly opened.  

With the unveiling of the family's secret vault, a dazzling spiritual light burst forth.  

Standing outside the chamber, Chen Daoxuan was nearly blinded by the radiance emanating from the spiritual stones.  

"This..."  

He turned to look at the clan leader, Chen Xianhe, only to see a smug smile on the elder's face—as if to say, *"Bet you're shocked, aren't you?"*  

Chen Daoxuan pursed his lips, trying to maintain a composed expression, but the occasional twitch of his cheek betrayed his excitement.  

*The family is freaking rich!*  

*There must be at least ten thousand spiritual stones here!*  

His gaze swept over the neatly arranged spiritual stones on the shelves.  

Besides the stones, the chamber also contained precious spiritual ores. Apart from copper ore and other common first-tier ores, Chen Daoxuan could even sense the spiritual fluctuations of second-tier ores.  

*Gulp.*  

His throat bobbed as he swallowed hard.  

"All of this... is the accumulated wealth of our Chen Clan over three hundred years. Impressive, isn't it?"  

Chen Xianhe's voice, tinged with nostalgia, sounded beside him. "When I first took over as clan leader and saw this, my reaction was much like yours."  

"Thirteenth Uncle, what’s going on here? You always said the family was poor. And if we have so many spiritual stones, why did you give up your cultivation? If these were converted into cultivation resources, you could’ve advanced further!"  

Chen Daoxuan's voice was urgent, clearly still troubled by Chen Xianhe's decision to abandon his own cultivation.  

He believed Chen Xianhe had sacrificed his own progress for his sake.  

"You're right," Chen Xianhe nodded. "Turning these into cultivation resources could indeed have pushed my cultivation further—perhaps even to the ninth level of Qi Refining if luck favored me. But then what? Could I have reached Foundation Establishment? No."  

He sighed. "To exhaust three centuries of our ancestors' accumulation for a mediocre talent like me would have been utterly foolish!"  

Hearing this, Chen Daoxuan fell silent.  

*Honor the ancestors, safeguard the descendants.*  

Chen Xianhe had set the finest example for him, a descendant of the Chen Clan, through his actions.  

Faced with such a man—such a clan leader—what more could Chen Daoxuan say?  

Without a word, he bowed deeply to Chen Xianhe in solemn respect.  

Chen Xianhe accepted the gesture calmly. After a moment, he waved his hand.  

"In total, there are 8,743 spiritual stones here, along with 635 jin of various first-tier ores. The most valuable among them are three pieces of second-tier ore."  

He pointed to an ornate wooden chest in the corner of the chamber. "These three pieces are just enough to forge a second-tier magical artifact. Unfortunately, in all these years, aside from you, our clan has never produced another artificer."  

"Now, I entrust all of this to you."  

Chen Xianhe locked eyes with Chen Daoxuan, and upon seeing his firm nod, he smiled in satisfaction.  

"Clan Leader, I have a question."  

"Speak."  

After gathering his thoughts, Chen Daoxuan continued, "Since the family has so many spiritual stones, why not use them to cultivate more disciples?"  

Chen Xianhe first nodded, then shook his head. "I understand what you mean. Such wealth could indeed nurture several more cultivators and restore the prosperity of the 'Xian' generation. But have you considered that cultivators who don’t reach Foundation Establishment live no more than 120 years? Once that generation passes, how will the Chen Clan survive without the copper mine or these savings?"  

Seeing Chen Daoxuan's silence, Chen Xianhe knew the young man didn’t fully agree with the elders' conservative approach.  

But then again, Chen Xianhe realized Chen Daoxuan was different. With his excellent talent and artificing skills, he naturally wanted to expand the family’s influence rather than hoard resources to slowly accumulate a spiritual vein.  

"Daoxuan, I know you want to strengthen the clan. Every generation of the Chen Clan has shared that desire. But remember—for a cultivation family to thrive, beyond inheritance techniques, a spiritual vein is the true foundation!"  

"Spiritual vein?" Chen Daoxuan frowned.  

"Exactly. Do you know why our Chen Clan once produced thirteen 'Xian'-generation cultivators?"  

Chen Daoxuan shook his head.  

"It was because of the seven spiritual eyes in our family."  

Chen Xianhe sighed. "Perhaps by our ancestors' blessing, or sheer luck, the previous clan leader, Chen Xianzhou, discovered four spiritual eyes in the Copper Mountain Range. Combined with the three our clan already had, that’s how we achieved the golden age of thirteen cultivators."  

"But spiritual eyes are rootless. Their emergence is unpredictable, and so is their exhaustion."  

Chen Daoxuan nodded in agreement.  

When he first began cultivating, the clan had two spiritual eyes—one for him and one for Chen Xianhe. But when he reached the second level of Qi Refining, Chen Xianhe’s spiritual eye inexplicably dried up, leaving the clan with only one.  

Seeing his expression, Chen Xianhe continued, "A spiritual vein is different. Unless the clan’s cultivators act recklessly, it will never deplete. For a cultivation family, possessing a spiritual vein means securing the foundation of their legacy. Unfortunately, though the Myriad Stars Sea has many spiritual veins, not a single one is unclaimed!"  

Chen Daoxuan pondered. "So... the family’s savings are meant to artificially nurture a spiritual vein?"  

"Precisely!"  

Amused by Chen Daoxuan’s stunned expression, Chen Xianhe chuckled. "I know you might think our ancestors were foolish—artificially creating a spiritual vein requires over 100,000 spiritual stones and the setup of a Spirit Nurturing Grand Formation. But if the Chen Clan is to truly establish itself in the Myriad Stars Sea, this is our only path!"  

Chen Daoxuan remained silent.  

He knew Chen Xianhe was right.  

Only with a spiritual vein could they cultivate spirit fields, grow medicinal herbs, raise spirit beasts—and most crucially, ensure the clan’s cultivators had sufficient spiritual energy for their practice.  

Not like now, where every day of cultivation was fraught with anxiety, fearing the spiritual eye in his cave might vanish.  

As Chen Xianhe had said, it felt like drifting without roots.  

Chen Daoxuan hated this lack of control over his fate.  

He would change it all.
