# Chapter 101: Thunder Dao Divine Ability

The trio and the serpent were trapped within the sea of blood, with four beams of spiritual light isolating them from the foul-smelling liquid. However, countless asuras, yakshas, and blood demons continuously assaulted them from all directions.

They kept using their magical artifacts to fend off the attacks, but each time they killed one of the blood fiends, it would dissolve back into the blood sea. Yet, more and more creatures kept emerging, wave after wave, fearless and relentless.

After battling for the time it takes an incense stick to burn, the horde of blood fiends showed no signs of diminishing—if anything, their numbers seemed to be increasing. Frustration began to gnaw at the group.

The longer they delayed, the more reinforcements the demonic faction would gather outside, and the more their spiritual energy would deplete. If this continued, they would truly be stuck in a quagmire with no way out.

"What do we do? These things are endless—we can't keep waiting like this!"

Seeing the dire situation, Lin Fan couldn't sit still any longer and turned to his senior sister, Lei Yuzi, for a solution. Lin Shan also looked at her, remembering what Lin Fan had mentioned earlier—that Lei Yuzi had mastered a minor divine ability despite only being at the Foundation Establishment stage.

Lei Yuzi frowned slightly, hesitation written all over her face. "My divine ability can indeed break through this blood sea, but as you can see, we're right in the middle of it. If I unleash my thunder-based divine ability, the blood sea will conduct the electricity... and both of you would likely die as well."

The implication was clear. As a practitioner of both water and thunder techniques, Lei Yuzi was well aware of the dangers of electricity in a conductive medium like blood. While she could use her divine ability to shatter the blood sea, the resulting lightning would indiscriminately strike everyone within—including her allies. That was why she hadn't acted sooner, fearing collateral damage.

At this point, Lin Fan, ever the treasure-hoarder, couldn't resist showing off. Clicking his tongue in exasperation at his senior sister's delayed revelation, he rummaged through his storage pouch and pulled out a massive, azure-blue orb the size of a human head.

"Whoosh—"

"Hummm—"

The enormous orb was translucent, with faint sounds of seashells echoing from within. Waves seemed to churn endlessly inside, shifting between mist and clouds like a weather glass.

"Is that... a magic treasure?!" Both Lin Shan and Lei Yuzi were stunned, sensing the overwhelming spiritual energy radiating from the orb—a clear indication of its power to manifest abilities beyond ordinary artifacts.

Lei Yuzi examined it uncertainly. "Is this... a Water-Repelling Pearl at the magic treasure level?"

"To be precise, it's a Sea-Repelling Pearl!" Lin Fan declared proudly. "I found it while exploring an underwater abode during my travels. Unfortunately, since we haven't reached the Golden Core stage and haven't refined our spiritual energy into true mana, we can't actively wield magic treasures. But we can still use them passively."

As he spoke, he gestured around them. Immediately, the blood sea that had been pressing against their protective barriers receded, creating a perfect vacuum within a radius of three meters. No liquid could penetrate this space—a testament to the power of the Sea-Repelling Pearl.

Watching Lin Fan's smug display, Lin Shan and Lei Yuzi exchanged glances, both feeling a pang of regret at such a treasure being used so casually. What kind of senior cultivator would waste precious fourth-tier materials—enough to forge a magic treasure—just to enhance something as trivial as a Water-Repelling Pearl? Yet, by sheer luck, Lin Fan had stumbled upon it, and now it was proving invaluable.

Lin Shan couldn't help but marvel at his companions. Not only was Lei Yuzi a prodigious talent from a major sect, but Lin Fan was practically a "child of fortune." With allies like these, he could simply coast along while they handled the heavy lifting.

Still, he reminded himself that while he had awakened his golden finger, he had only been cultivating for less than three years. Without the backing of a major sect and having taken so many detours, he needed to rely on such powerful allies for now. Only by growing stronger and accumulating more ancient essence could he hope to surpass them one day.

Without further delay, Lei Yuzi recalled her water serpent spirit beast. With the blood sea now repelled, she sat cross-legged, chanting incantations and weaving hand seals. 

Unlike Lin Shan's instant-cast divine ability, "Nailhead Seven Arrows Book"—bestowed directly by the Celestial Tome—Lei Yuzi's technique required a casting time, as she hadn't yet condensed a divine ability seed. Without decades of practice or cursing hundreds of people to build proficiency, such abilities couldn't be unleashed at will.

As Lei Yuzi's chanting grew louder and faster, her hands flickered like butterflies in intricate patterns. Lin Shan found the movements oddly familiar—hadn't Lin Fan mimicked something similar when using the "Blazing Sky Incineration Talisman"?

Glancing at Lin Fan, he saw the young man enthusiastically copying the gestures, imitating them with surprising accuracy. 

*So that's where he got it from!* Lin Shan realized. *I thought he was just making it up before!*

Lin Fan must have seen Lei Yuzi perform this during a sparring match and memorized the flashy hand seals, practicing them in secret. After all, looking cool was a lifelong pursuit.

Lei Yuzi, her spiritual energy running low, swallowed a pill and held a spirit stone to replenish her reserves. After a casting time of about four or five breaths, her aura peaked.

"Crackle—crackle—"

Electricity began to dance in the air around them. Silver serpents of lightning emerged from the void, instantly vaporizing hundreds of blood fiends in the sea. Thunder elements gathered rapidly, and the distant rumble of thunder grew louder from beyond the blood sea.

This was the essence of a divine ability—borrowing the power of heaven and earth, amplifying the caster's might tenfold compared to ordinary spells.

Lei Yuzi's body crackled with lightning, resembling an ancient thunder goddess, wielding divine judgment over mortals.

As the lightning intensified and the blood sea thinned, her eyes snapped open—twin bolts of lightning flashing in her cold, blue gaze. Lin Shan could almost see the indifference of the heavens reflected in her eyes.

Those two bolts acted as a catalyst, drawing all the surrounding thunder into a massive vortex. The lightning swirled around them, churning the blood sea into a whirlpool with a colossal eye at its center.

Thunder roared, waves surged—it was as if doomsday had arrived.

A blinding white light engulfed the world, drowning out the crimson hues.

"BOOM—CRACK—!"

Lin Shan and Lin Fan squeezed their eyes shut, fearing they might go blind from the brilliance. Clutching each other like frightened chicks, they trembled as the storm raged around them.

...

Time seemed to stretch—or perhaps it was only an instant.

The rain stopped. The thunder faded. Silence fell, so profound it was as if their hearing had vanished.

When they opened their eyes again, a faint ringing lingered in their ears before the sounds of battle returned.

They found themselves back on the mountainside, amidst the grass and trees. Lei Yuzi stood protectively in front of them, her presence radiating strength and reliability.

All around them lay countless corpses, shattered ruins, and charred stumps of trees. It was impossible to tell how many demonic cultivators had been obliterated by Lei Yuzi's divine ability, but the lone figure of the blood-robed youth standing amidst the devastation spoke volumes.

The youth stood frozen, staring blankly at the tattered treasure map in his hands. 

*Am I... the only one left?*
