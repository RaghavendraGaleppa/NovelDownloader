**Chapter 37: Internal Strife in the Mo Family**

Lu Xu and Gao Tianqiang entered Tianmen City from two different directions.

"The Mo family has also come to Tianmen City. This is really not good news!" Lu Xu's eyes showed a thoughtful expression.

"But then again, why did Gao Tianqiang come to Tianmen City? Is he returning to his old profession, monitoring the Wei family and gathering intelligence?"

"What is the Black Robe Society planning? Occupying Qinghu Market is like giving up their biggest advantage, standing openly to face attacks from the three families. Can they withstand it?"

"I always feel there's some conspiracy here. The Black Robe Society seems very confident; they must have someone backing them up, right?"

"The Wei family's strength is not something the Mo family can compare to. If the Black Robe Society clashes head-on with the Wei family, it would be like hitting a stone with an egg!"

"Judging from their performance in the battle at Qinghu Market, the Black Robe Society is definitely not foolish. They must have a backer!"

"In the Wei Kingdom, only one power can suppress the Wei family..."

A guess gradually formed in Lu Xu's mind:

Could it be that the Black Robe Society is actually a pawn of the Thousand Desolations Sect?

Thousand Desolations Sect, Wei Family, Black Robe Society, Mo Family.

Mulling over these names, Lu Xu recalled some news he had heard recently in Tianmen City.

That Golden Core True Person from the Thousand Desolations Sect was already five hundred years old!

A Golden Core cultivator's total lifespan is around five hundred years. This meant that the elder who stood at the pinnacle of the Eastern Desolate Cultivation World, suppressing the Wei Kingdom for an entire era, was about to meet his end.

And within the Thousand Desolations Sect, there was no second Golden Core cultivator, no one to take his place.

In contrast, the imperial Wei family was strong and prosperous, with talents emerging constantly!

Under such circumstances, it would be strange if these two families could live in harmony!

The Wei family was an ambitious clan, and the Thousand Desolations Sect also wanted to maintain its status.

"Thus, it seems the Wei Kingdom's cultivation world won't be peaceful for much longer. A war might break out!"

"Turbulent times ahead. If my conjecture is true, the entire Wei Kingdom's cultivation world will never be peaceful again!"

To verify his guess, Lu Xu spent several days visiting places where cultivators gathered in Tianmen City, trying to gather information.

As a result, he didn't hear much about conflicts between the Wei family and the Thousand Desolations Sect. Instead, he made another discovery.

"The Wei family actually possesses a secret art that allows martial artists to contend with cultivators!"

Lu Xu was greatly surprised. He looked at the linen-clad old man in front of him and said:

"Martial artists can actually contend with cultivators? This is unheard of!"

"Haha, the first time this old man heard about it, I was as astonished as you, fellow daoist. Although those martial arts practitioners have some skills, they are ultimately mortals. How could they fight against us cultivators?"

"But forty years ago, this old man personally witnessed a Wei family prince repel the attack of a low-grade magical artifact with his bare hands!"

"I had no choice but to believe that there truly exists a method in this world that allows martial artists to contend with cultivators. However, martial artists who cultivate this secret art probably can no longer be called mortals!"

"Some in the cultivation world call them Body Refiners. The main direction of cultivation for these martial artists seems to be the tempering of their physical bodies!"

"Body Refiners? It seems this world is even more interesting than I imagined!" Lu Xu thought to himself.

There was still a path upward in the martial arts. Above first-rate masters, there were martial artists who could contend with cultivators' spells and magical artifacts bare-handed.

Lu Xu's interest in this secret art was immediately piqued.

"It is said that cultivating this martial arts secret art can significantly increase the probability of successful Foundation Establishment. The reason the Wei family has so many Foundation Establishment cultivators is not unrelated to this martial arts secret art!" The linen-clad old man said with eyes full of envy.

"Foundation Establishment, what a tempting secret art!" Lu Xu said, putting on an appearance of deep yearning.

"Who wouldn't be tempted? When this old man was young, I always felt I had hope of Foundation Establishment, so I tried every possible way to inquire about this secret art's news!"

The old man laughed a few times, then added:

"But who would have thought that merely a bottleneck in the late Qi Condensation stage would trap this old man for ten years, unable to break through even now!"

"This old man is already over sixty years old, so I no longer harbor such unrealistic delusions!"

Lu Xu offered a few words of comfort:

"Why be disheartened, fellow daoist? There are late bloomers in the cultivation world. As long as you don't give up, there's still hope for the future!"

The old man chuckled noncommittally at these words.

Like Lu Xu, he had a middle-to-low grade spiritual root.

However, he was just an ordinary rogue cultivator, with no great fortuitous encounters in his life.

His cultivation was diligently achieved through arduous practice. It took him over forty years to cultivate to the peak of the sixth level of Qi Condensation.

But ever since then, he had been stuck at the bottleneck of the late Qi Condensation stage, unable to break through.

The passion of his youth had long since cooled!

"Fellow daoist, do you know who among the Wei family currently cultivates this secret art? I am truly curious and wish to pay them a visit!"

The old man shook his head when he heard this:

"The Wei family prince this old man saw forty years ago is now the Emperor. It would be difficult for you to meet him!"

"As for others, this old man is not clear. The Wei family keeps this secret art very closely guarded!"

"It seems then that only core members of the Wei family can master this secret art!" Lu Xu thought to himself.

After chatting with the old man for a while longer, he rose and left the tea house.

Walking on the street, Lu Xu recalled the various rumors about the Wei family's secret art he had just heard, and a strong desire surged within him.

A secret art that could increase the chance of Foundation Establishment must be obtained no matter what.

Having entered the cultivation world for several years, Lu Xu had heard countless people speak of the difficulty of Foundation Establishment.

In the vast Wei Kingdom's cultivation world, there were more than a hundred thousand cultivators.

But only a few dozen succeeded in Foundation Establishment!

Lu Xu knew that with his mid-grade spiritual root, his aptitude was simply not enough to pass the Foundation Establishment stage.

But he didn't want to give up on Foundation Establishment like Old Xu or He Qing, so he had to prepare for it in advance now.

This secret art was absolutely not to be missed.

After walking on the street for a moment, Lu Xu saw a spirit rice shop.

Thinking that the spirit rice he bought two years ago was almost gone, Lu Xu went to the shop, intending to buy some more.

With a glance, he spotted several familiar types of spirit rice in the shop.

"Qinghu Spirit Rice, Purple Gourd Spirit Rice... these are all produced in Qinghu Market. It seems this shop is related to Qinghu Market!"

Lu Xu strolled forward, and an attendant immediately came to greet him.

"How much is this Purple Gourd Spirit Rice?"

"One spirit stone for five catties!"

"Why is it so expensive?"

"Expensive? Is it not normal for spirit rice to be expensive now? Fellow daoist, you wouldn't be unaware, would you? Qinghu Market was taken over by the Black Robe Society. That was an important spirit rice production area in the Wei Kingdom. Now that the harvest there has stopped, the grain prices throughout the Wei Kingdom have risen!"

Hearing the shop attendant's explanation, Lu Xu was momentarily speechless.

Purple Gourd Spirit Rice, as a first-grade mid-quality spirit rice, usually cost one spirit stone for about twelve catties.

Now it had directly risen to one spirit stone for five catties.

It seemed the impact of Qinghu Market being breached was quite significant. Spirit rice was a necessity in cultivators' daily lives. Now that rice prices had risen, the lives of lower-level cultivators were becoming increasingly difficult.

As Lu Xu was considering whether to buy, footsteps sounded from upstairs.

Several figures walked down the stairs, conversing as they descended:

"Has Mo Hu's whereabouts been investigated?"

"There are no clues yet. He disappeared suddenly after a trip to the capital!"

"It seems he's already in dire straits. Investigate carefully. I suspect people from the Black Robe Society might have already arrived in Tianmen City!"

"Mo Hu? Isn't that Fatty Mo? The Mo family is investigating his disappearance!" Lu Xu thought to himself upon hearing the conversation.

He subtly looked over and indeed saw several familiar figures.

Mo Qingchan, Mo Changzong, and two other Mo family cultivators at the sixth level of Qi Condensation.

"Quite a few Mo family members escaped, actually!" Lu Xu secretly thought.

He picked up a handful of spirit rice and carefully examined it, as if checking its quality.

His ears, however, were perked up, listening intently to the conversation between the few people.

He had worn a bronze mask when he left home, so he wasn't afraid of being recognized by these Mo family members.

"Qingchan, have you made up your mind about that matter? This is not the time for stubbornness. The family needs you to step forward!" Mo Changzong's voice suddenly rang out.

"Seventh Uncle, aren't you overly concerned? What benefits did that Fourth Prince promise you?"

"Impudent! Qingchan, you're becoming more and more disrespectful! The Fourth Prince is the most talented among the Wei family's younger generation. He will certainly be able to achieve Foundation Establishment in the future. What about him do you dislike?"

"Most talented, will certainly be able to achieve Foundation Establishment..."

The speaker was unintentional, but the listener was attentive. Lu Xu, overhearing these words, immediately made a mental note of this Fourth Prince.

"Seventh Uncle, I don't want to argue about this outside. Let's discuss it when we get home!" Mo Qingchan said coldly, turning to leave directly.

Mo Changzong watched her departing back, his face filled with uncontainable anger.

"Hmph, what is this bastard thinking? The future of our Mo family depends entirely on the Wei family's support, yet she actually rejected the Fourth Prince!"

"Elder Changzong, I think it's because she covets the position of family head, isn't it? If she marries out, she won't be able to become the Mo family head!"

"Family head? What right does a bastard born of a live-in son-in-law have to inherit the family head position? I will not let her have her way!" Mo Changzong said through gritted teeth.

His eyes blazing with fury, he suddenly turned and reprimanded the attendant who was talking to Lu Xu:

"The price of spirit rice is too low! Everyone else has raised it to one spirit stone for three catties, why are you still one spirit stone for five catties? Raise the price immediately!"

"So this is a Mo family spirit rice shop!" Lu Xu immediately understood.

"The Mo family's situation looks dire right now. Their external troubles haven't even been resolved, yet their internal strife is already so intense that they don't even avoid outsiders, directly erupting in public!"

Lu Xu subtly sized up Mo Changzong. At Qinghu Market, he had already felt that this person, though strong, didn't have much political sense.

Now he was even more certain of his impression.

Lu Xu pretended to examine the rice, hoping to gather more intelligence from Mo Changzong.

But unfortunately, after cursing a few harsh words like "bastard" and "vile slave" through gritted teeth, Mo Changzong left with the two Mo family cultivators.

Seeing this, Lu Xu also turned to leave the shop.

"Fellow daoist, aren't you buying spirit rice anymore?" the attendant behind him called out loudly.

"You've raised it to one spirit stone for three catties, how can I still afford it!" Lu Xu shook his head and immediately vanished into the crowd.
