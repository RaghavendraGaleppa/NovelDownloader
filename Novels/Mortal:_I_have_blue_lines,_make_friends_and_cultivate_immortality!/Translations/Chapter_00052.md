**Chapter 52: Lin Yun: You Came at the Perfect Time! (1/3)**  

Lin Yun glanced at the Soul Fusion Talisman in his hand, then looked at Han Li.  

"Brother Lin, I—" Han Li anxiously tried to explain.  

Lin Yun tossed the talisman back to him. "We'll talk later. Let me deal with this guy first."  

Han Li pressed his lips together and nodded.  

"It's you—!" Feng Yue turned his head, his expression darkening as he recognized Lin Yun.  

This was the very target their sect had ordered them to eliminate—Lin Yun of the Yellow Maple Valley!  

*Not good—I can't take him on alone!*  

*I need to find that Moon Veil Sect woman. Her Azure Condensation Mirror can immobilize magical artifacts and talismans. Only by teaming up with her do we stand a chance!*  

With a thought, several mid-tier Ice Spear Talismans flew out from his storage pouch. In a flash of white light, over a dozen crystalline spears shot toward Lin Yun.  

Seizing the moment while Lin Yun was distracted, Feng Yue manipulated the yellow glow of his dagger-like talisman treasure to sever the vines entangling him.  

But as soon as the vines were cut, they immediately regrew, crawling up his body again. *Why are his spells so much more troublesome than others?!*  

Feng Yue cursed inwardly.  

Meanwhile, Han Li saw the ice spears hurtling toward Lin Yun and shouted, "Brother Lin, watch out behind you!"  

He summoned his Earth Shield, intending to block the incoming attack.  

But the next second, he froze in shock.  

Lin Yun charged straight toward the spears. Upon contact with his body, the ice shattered as if striking an indestructible barrier.  

"Brother Lin's body—it's terrifyingly strong!" Han Li gasped. "He can effortlessly withstand mid-tier Ice Spear spells?!"  

*Is that even humanly possible?!*  

Feng Yue, still struggling with the vines, turned his head just in time to witness the scene. His jaw dropped. He had never seen anyone tank Ice Spear Talismans with their bare body before. *Is this guy even a cultivator?!*  

*Forget killing him—I need to escape!*  

*This guy is way more troublesome than I imagined! Not only are his spells relentless, but his physical body is monstrous! I need reinforcements!*  

*Damn it—he's closing in!*  

Feng Yue tried to activate his Cloud-Treading Boots to flee, but the vines seemed endless, sprouting from the ground to coil around his ankles and body.  

Worse still, these vines were incredibly tough, their hardness comparable to magical artifacts!  

"Still trying to run?"  

Lin Yun smirked. "Mire Technique!"  

With a soft incantation, the terrain around them warped, transforming into a vast swamp that completely cut off any escape route.  

The Cloud-Treading Boots were indeed fast, but their weakness was their lack of flight enhancement. By altering the terrain, Lin Yun rendered them nearly useless.  

"Such a massive range?!" Han Li was stunned. Lin Yun's Mire Technique covered an area three times larger than his own, and the casting speed was incomparable.  

"Damn it—!"  

Trapped in the swamp, the mud beneath him dragging him down like a bottomless abyss, Feng Yue felt his heart sink. His prized boots were now useless.  

"Fellow Daoist—wait—!"  

"Spare me!"  

"We're both from the Seven Sects! Why fight to the death?"  

"How about we become friends?"  

"If you ever need anything from me, Feng Yue, just say the word! I'll go through fire and water for you!"  

"I can even tell you the plans our Sky Fortress Sect has against you!"  

**[Ding. Feng Yue has sent you a friend request.]**  

**[Ding. Congratulations, Host! You have obtained a top-tier artifact: Yellow Parasol (Elite, dual-purpose offense and defense).]**  

"Not a talisman treasure? Not even the Cloud-Treading Boots?" Lin Yun was disappointed.  

"You're not sincere about being friends."  

He strode forward, grabbing Feng Yue by the neck, ready to finish him off.  

Just then, Moon Veil Sect’s Zhou Qingning finally arrived. It wasn’t that she was slow—it was just that Feng Yue and Han Li had moved too quickly.  

Emerging from the forest, she saw Lin Yun holding Feng Yue aloft by the throat in the middle of the swamp.  

"Did I come at a bad time?" Zhou Qingning asked awkwardly.  

Though she looked down on Feng Yue, she acknowledged his strength. As a peak Qi Refinement cultivator with top-tier artifacts and a talisman treasure, he was slightly stronger than her. That was why she had reluctantly agreed to team up with him.  

"No—you came at the perfect time." Lin Yun smiled.  

"I was just looking for you."  

He tossed Feng Yue toward Han Li. "Handle him."  

"Stay back!" Zhou Qingning flicked her wrist, summoning a flying sword that she pressed against the neck of the Yellow Maple Valley female disciple. "Take another step, and I’ll kill her!"  

The woman played along, crying out in fear, "Senior Brother Lin, save me! I don’t want to die!"  

"Senior Brother, as long as you save me, I’ll do anything!"  

"Junior Sister, many people in this world don’t want to die." Lin Yun sighed. "Don’t worry. I’ll avenge you. Rest in peace."  

"Senior Brother, I *really* appreciate that!"  

Lin Yun shrugged and turned to Zhou Qingning. "Well? What are you waiting for?"  

"N-no! Stay away!" Zhou Qingning was stunned. Wasn’t Lin Yun supposed to be kind and compassionate? Why was he so indifferent?  

*Thud—*  

*Thud—*  

*Thud—*  

Each of Lin Yun’s footsteps hammered against her heart like a drum. She trembled, sweat pouring down her face. "D-don’t come any closer!"  

As the treasured granddaughter of a Moon Veil Sect Core Formation elder, she had always been pampered. She had never faced a life-or-death situation like this.  

Regret flooded her. *Why did I team up with Feng Yue just to mess with Lin Yun?!*  

"Stay back—!"  

"I’ll really do it!"  

"Junior Sister, your vigilance is lacking." Lin Yun shook his head. "My spellcasting range is already sufficient. Next time, act faster."  

With a snap of his fingers—*click*—vines burst from the ground beneath Zhou Qingning, launching her into the air. Her limbs and neck were swiftly bound in an intricate, restrictive pattern, leaving her sprawled helplessly midair.  

"Ah—!" She shrieked, struggling to retrieve a weapon from her storage pouch. But Lin Yun merely flicked his fingers, and a vine delivered the pouch to his hand.  

"How’s my ‘Tortoise Shell Bind,’ Junior Sister?" Lin Yun grinned.  

The rescued Yellow Maple Valley disciple gasped for air. "Thank you, Senior Brother Lin!"  

"We’re fellow disciples. No need for formalities." Lin Yun waved her off.  

By now, Han Li had already incinerated Feng Yue with a Fireball Technique. He approached, handing Lin Yun the Cloud-Treading Boots and Feng Yue’s storage pouch.  

"Brother Lin." Han Li’s voice was subdued, weighed down by something unspoken.  

Meanwhile, the female disciple, still seething from Zhou Qingning’s earlier abuse, picked up a vine and began whipping her.  

"Ah—!"  

"Stop! Please!"  

Having grown up spoiled within her sect and family, Zhou Qingning had never endured such torment. She screamed in agony.  

After dozens of lashes, the vine finally snapped. The female disciple exhaled sharply, a twisted smile on her face. "Senior Brother, I’ve vented my anger. You can kill her now."  

"She’s the descendant of a Moon Veil Sect Core Formation elder. If you let her go, she’ll bring endless trouble."  

"Senior Brother, spare me!" Zhou Qingning begged, tears streaming. "I saw you at the Tai Nan Gathering, remember? My grandmother is a Core Formation elder! If you let me go, I’ll repay you after we leave the Bloody Battlefield!"  

"You and I aren’t ordinary disciples. You know I can’t just ask my grandmother to retaliate against you!"  

"Senior Brother, she’s a viper!" the female disciple hissed. "Killing her is the only safe option!" She eyed Lin Yun, mistaking his hesitation for reluctance. "If you don’t want to dirty your hands, I’ll do it."  

"Who said I was going to kill her?" Lin Yun inspected Zhou Qingning’s storage pouch but didn’t find what he wanted.  

The female disciple froze. "Huh?"  

Lin Yun smirked. "I have other plans for her."
