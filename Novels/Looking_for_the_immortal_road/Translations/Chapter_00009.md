# Chapter Nine: Xuanyuan City

Zhao Di slept until noon the next day. He took a few deep breaths of the fresh mountain air, feeling refreshed and invigorated.

He rolled the white tiger hide into a bundle, slung it over his back, and strode into the mountains.

The journey was uneventful. Zhao Di didn't encounter any rare beasts or the various fire-breathing, ice-spitting demonic beasts he feared. Relying on his cultivator's physique, which far surpassed that of mortals, he traveled day and night, resting only one night every two or three days. Finally, after about ten days, he emerged from the Nanhua Mountain Range.

At the foot of the mountain, Zhao Di met a sixty- to seventy-year-old woodsman with a face full of wrinkles. After confirming his direction, he continued his journey day and night until he reached his first destination—Xuanyuan City. This was also the closest mortal town to the Nanhua Mountain Grand Canyon, where the Jian family resided.

"Baoli Pawnshop" was located on Chang'an Street, the most bustling and prosperous street in Xuanyuan City, and it was the largest pawnshop in the city. Six burly men stood perpetually at its entrance, indicating that it was not a place just anyone could enter.

"Six-Finger" Li was currently in the pawnshop. He earned this nickname because he had six fingers on his right hand. Introduced by a relative, he had worked as a helper in this shop since childhood, for over thirty years. Now, he was the manager of the shop. Besides reporting business conditions to the owner and receiving distinguished guests, he didn't need to personally handle trivial matters. The nickname "Six-Finger" was also used less and less; in Xuanyuan City, except for a few important figures, most people would respectfully address him as "Sixth Master" when they saw him.

Liu San, the young man responsible for the counter at Baoli Pawnshop, had gone back to his hometown for his wedding these past few days. Due to a shortage of staff, "Sixth Master" had no choice but to personally man the shop.

There was usually little business in the late morning. "Sixth Master" sat with his legs crossed, leaning back in a comfortable rattan chair, humming a few tunes. His thoughts soon drifted to his fourth concubine, who could sing; her sweet, delicate voice, her graceful figure, her fragrant scent... Before long, "Sixth Master" drifted off to sleep.

"Is this a pawnshop? I want to pawn something!"

A timid young male voice woke Li Liuzhi from his sweet dream. He lazily opened his eyes and saw a fair-faced young man leaning over the counter, only a head taller than the counter itself. His clothes were yellowed and torn in several places, and he exuded an air of rusticity, clearly from the countryside.

Li Liuzhi made an instant judgment and retorted impatiently, "Our shop doesn't accept business below five taels of silver."

"I want to sell a white tiger hide. Someone told me to come here." The country boy seemed to hesitate, his timid tone clearly lacking confidence.

"What, a white tiger hide?" These words shocked Li Liuzhi, instantly banishing all sleepiness.

The country boy didn't say much, placing the bundled animal hide from his back onto the counter.

Li Liuzhi opened the hide with skepticism. A complete white tiger hide, over two meters long, unfolded before him. Even he, who had handled many rare treasures, felt his breathing quicken.

He was an old hand, after all. After a few deep breaths, he calmly said, "Hmm, it is a white tiger hide, but it's one of the inferior kinds. Do you want to sell it outright, or pawn it temporarily to redeem it later?" His tone made it sound like a worthless piece of ordinary sheepskin or cowhide, and the distinction between good and inferior white tiger hides was entirely made up on the spot.

"Sell it outright!" the young man replied promptly.

"Alright then, our shop will offer five hundred taels of silver for it," Li Liuzhi carefully considered, quoting a very low price.

"I don't want silver, I want gold. Besides, five hundred taels is too little. Someone told me it's worth at least three thousand taels!" The young man frowned.

Hearing the young man's words, Li Liuzhi immediately realized that the young man was unaware that the true price of the white tiger hide was actually over five thousand taels. Meeting such a naive person, he was secretly delighted, but his expression became increasingly solemn, as if making a difficult decision. After a while, he said, "Alright, then twenty-five taels of gold. That's equivalent to two thousand five hundred taels of silver. Any more than that and our shop won't make a profit."

"Okay, it's a deal!" The young man was remarkably decisive. Li Liuzhi was startled. Although he was somewhat confident the young man would sell the white tiger hide at that price, he didn't expect it to be so quick and smooth.

"Here are twenty-five taels of gold. Please take it. Where are you heading? Would you like our humble shop to provide an escort?" Li Liuzhi's face was now beaming with fawning smiles, completely unlike his previous lazy demeanor.

"No need." The young man took the twenty-five taels of gold and left the shop without lingering.

"Heh heh, luck has arrived!" Li Liuzhi secretly conceived an even more sinister idea. He gestured to the burly guards at the door.

Immediately, two of the burly men quietly approached him. These two bore a slight resemblance to each other. One had a blue dragon tattoo on his arm, while the other had a fiery red Qilin tattooed on his arm. The man with the blue dragon tattoo quietly asked, "Sixth Master, what are your orders? Should we finish him off and retrieve the gold?"

"Don't rush. Follow him for a while, find a secluded spot to make your move. We can't do it right outside our shop and ruin our reputation. And make sure no one sees you; if someone does, we'll have to spend a lot of silver bribing the officials again," Li Liuzhi calmly instructed.

"Yes, Sixth Master, you can rest assured. My brother and I will handle this cleanly, leaving no trace," the tattooed strongman patted his chest, guaranteeing softly. Having said that, he turned and left. At this time, the country boy who sold the white tiger hide had just left the shop by a few tens of meters.

This young man was naturally Zhao Di, who had just arrived in Xuanyuan City. With his current divine sense, the conversation between the pawnshop manager and the tattooed strongmen was as clear as if they were speaking right beside his ear. He sneered inwardly, pondering how to deal with these fools who didn't know their place. As a cultivator, dealing with a few mortals was an extremely simple matter. Even if these strongmen were given a hundred opportunities to launch a sneak attack, they wouldn't be able to harm Zhao Di in the slightest.

Presently, he deliberately chose to turn into a less populated area. After several twists and turns, he arrived at a deserted alley.

The two burly men behind him were overjoyed, thinking that this country boy had clearly gotten lost in the city and had actually walked into such a secluded dead-end alley on his own, saving them a lot of trouble. But just as they followed the young man into the dead-end alley, preparing to reveal themselves and commit murder for profit, the most unexpected thing happened.

The alley was completely empty; there was no sign of the young man. Both strongmen blinked hard. The one with the blue dragon tattoo even rubbed his eyes. Then, they looked at each other, seeing disbelief in each other's eyes.

"Slap!" The blue dragon strongman received a stinging slap across his face. He turned around in shock and anger, only to see the Qilin strongman with his right hand raised, a bewildered expression on his face.

"I, it wasn't me, I don't know, I didn't hit you." Facing the furious gaze of the blue dragon strongman, the Qilin strongman was somewhat incoherent. He had suddenly felt something hit his right wrist, forcing his right hand to raise high, and then, inexplicably, he heard a crisp slap. The only fortunate thing was that the slap wasn't on his own face.

The two continued to search the three-to-five-meter wide dead-end alley suspiciously, leaving no object unchecked: a water vat, a basket, even a broken basin where it was impossible for anyone to hide.

"Slap!"

Another loud slap, again landing on the blue dragon strongman, again from the Qilin strongman's raised right hand.

The blue dragon strongman, already disoriented by the sudden disappearance of the young man, was completely enraged. He gave the other no chance to explain, launching an old-fashioned punch at the Qilin strongman's face.

The Qilin strongman was also bewildered and utterly unprepared for such close-range attack. He instinctively tilted his head back, dodging the iron fist from his eyes and other vital areas, but his nose bridge was hit hard, immediately seeing stars and bleeding profusely. Ignoring the sharp pain, he raised a leg and kicked the blue dragon strongman in the inner thigh...

Seeing the two wrestling and fighting, Zhao Di, who had used the "Concealment Spell," quietly departed with satisfaction.

After walking for a while, he dispelled the Concealment Spell and arrived at a post station. As far as he knew, the most convenient mode of transportation available in the mortal world was horse-drawn carriages. A post station was a place specifically for renting and selling fine steeds and carriages.

The manager of the post station, surnamed Luo, was a thin, forty-something man with two sparse mustaches. He was looking at Zhao Di with a half-smile, not believing that this shabbily dressed country boy would bring him any business.

Having witnessed the mortals' snobbery, Zhao Di simply took out a gleaming gold ingot, tossed it onto the counter, and declared loudly, "Get me the fastest and best carriage, and hire two of the most experienced coachmen! Also, prepare some high-grade dry rations and a few sets of clean clothes for this young master. Do a good job, and the remaining money will be my reward."
