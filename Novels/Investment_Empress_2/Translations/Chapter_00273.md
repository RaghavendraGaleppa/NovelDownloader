# Chapter 273: Go for It, Big Brother from the Mingjiao Clan!

The Buddha’s Kingdom in the Palm, the Five Elements Realm.

Entering the alms bowl, Li Mo felt as if he had entered the seed of an Inner World, yet it wasn't entirely the same.

A Small World is completely independent, with no connection to the outside world.

The Buddha’s Kingdom in the Palm, however, relies on the 'Dao' grasped by a Xuan-level expert. That Dao belongs to the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, so it is still mysteriously connected to them.

Strictly speaking, the Five Elements Realm is more similar to the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

But the 'Dao' within this place still exists, and because of the Jade Phoenix God, it has gained additional divine wonder.

Passing through a world of dazzling, kaleidoscopic light.

Xiao Li of the Heavenly Flood Dragon did not land on solid ground but fell directly into the turbulent waters. Fortunately, he had undergone special training before coming and quickly stabilized his figure.

His eyes were filled with a vast ocean, jagged reefs piercing through the water, and continuous drizzle.

However, through the rain curtain, a glimmer of light vanished.

"Jade Phoenix God..."

As a ray of light shone upon him, the Mingjiao Divine Will within Li Mo became a bit more灵动 (lively/spiritual).

But only for an instant.

The spiritual light of the Jade Phoenix God disappeared.

"We must cross the waters to reach the foot of the solitary peak," said Wu Dameng, who had now revealed his original form and swam to Li Mo's side. "According to the Third Ancestor, the Heavenly Jade will project True Spirits based on the bloodlines of everyone who enters. You might even see long-extinct species from the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands."

"Only by defeating the True Spirit and obtaining the guidance of its spiritual light can we reach the foot of the peak. Otherwise, we will be lost within the Five Elements Realm."

Wu Dameng vigilantly scanned his surroundings.

"So that's how it is, but..." Li Mo fell silent for a moment, looking at Wu Dameng who was clinging to him, and said helplessly, "Can you get off me first?"

"Aw, aw..." Wu Dameng was a demon who knew how to cling to a powerful thigh.

But this Five Elements Realm was undoubtedly more dangerous than usual.

"What do we do now?"

"First, let's find the other water demons."

Before the True Spirit projections descend.

Li Mo and Wu Dameng began to search for nearby water demons.

In the Five Elements Realm, spiritual sense was suppressed to within three feet. Fortunately, Li Mo had a waterproof notebook made from Green Vein Jade Slips.

"Guo Jing... trapped by the reefs due to her large size."

Suddenly.

*BOOM—*

A strange rumbling sound echoed as countless meteors erupted from the Heavenly Jade Solitary Peak, raining down upon the Five Elements Realm.

The magnificent meteor shower was a spectacular sight.

Each one represented a True Spirit.

***

Outside.

As all the young demons entered the Five Elements Realm, a projection was cast from the alms bowl, using the sky as a screen to show the scenes inside to the demons outside.

The many great demons and Demon Kings who had escorted their juniors gathered below the screen to watch.

"I remember when I was young, after entering the Five Elements Realm, the Heavenly Jade projected a Nine-Headed Bird on me."

"The humans have a saying: the waves behind drive on those before. The little ones fighting for the Jade this time have bloodlines much stronger than ours back then."

"I wonder... if we will see the shadows of True Dragons and True Phoenixes in the Jade?"

...

All the demons watched the situation within the Five Elements Realm with nervous expressions.

Unfortunately, there was only one screen, so they could only see one location at a time.

The demons stared at each other, all wanting to see their own juniors.

"Let's watch the Qingluan Goddess first."

"Why should we?"

"Can I make the screen produce sound? Or do you want to watch without hearing?"

"... Please go ahead."

She took out a set of chimes and snapped her fingers. The chimes began to play automatically, but they weren't ringing; rather, they played the immersive sounds from within the Five Elements Realm.

Shang Qinqing successfully snatched the 'remote control' with her surround-sound environmental audio.

The画面 (image) shifted to the Qingluan Goddess.

***

She was located in the vast forest of the Five Elements Realm, where giant trees grew, blocking out the sky and sun.

Above the lush greenery woven by the leaves was an endless storm of vital energy. If one left the shelter of the trees, even a great demon would struggle to advance through the storm.

The girl did not advance but stood before a few Qingluan clan members following her.

She was not holding a sword but cradling a cyan ancient zither in her arms.

"They're here," Ying Bing said softly.

Her voice had just fallen when a True Spirit plummeted to the ground. It was a large bird standing several meters tall.

Its head was white, its cry sounded as if it came from the depths of one's heart, and every feather seemed to be condensed from morning light.

"Yellow Bird?" The Qingluan clan members felt an instinctive pressure deep in their bloodlines.

None of them were pure-blooded Qingluan.

"Fall back."

As she spoke.

The sound of the zither rose sharply.

This was undoubtedly the ancient zither once used by Shang Qinqing. After being played by a new master, the melody carried more chill and sharpness.

*Zheng—*

An invisible melody tore through the void and swept toward the Yellow Bird in an instant.

The Yellow Bird's first reaction was not to fight.

It flapped its wings and fled as if it had seen a ghost!

Outside.

All the great demons and Demon Kings who saw this scene couldn't help but twitch their eyelids. They could tell the Yellow Bird's divinity; it was a powerful avian species that had long vanished from the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Yet, facing this girl, it could only flee for its life!

And it couldn't escape.

The melody contained countless types of human sword qi and sword intent, weaving an invisible net.

What kind of control was this?

And... wouldn't she run out of energy?

"Trying to flee?"

The girl's clear, high voice made the demons shiver.

It didn't take long.

The Yellow Bird's True Spirit turned into a speck of spiritual light and merged into the girl's眉心 (glabella), making her, who was already cold and elegant, seem even more sacred. She touched the small gourd at her waist and raised her slender eyebrows slightly.

The demons fell into deep thought.

Many of them had participated in the Jade争夺 (struggle) decades ago.

They had to be cautious and barely survived near-death experiences just to challenge a True Spirit.

The Qingluan Goddess clearly played a different game!

Who was the challenger here?

"Is there any point in our juniors fighting for the Heavenly Jade now?"

"Even several demons working together might not be able to take down that Yellow Bird True Spirit. That was the projection of a Third Rank Demon Saint that truly existed back in the day."

"I knew I shouldn't have brought out the Monkey Wine. Just give her the Jade directly."

"Have you noticed? After absorbing the True Spirit, her aura got a bit stronger."

"Is she even using her full force? She hasn't even revealed her true form."

She was so strong she made demons despair.

The water demons trembled.

This young mistress was very keen on slaying demons. If she slays disaster beasts now, what will she do if there aren't enough disaster beasts for her to chop later?

Are we sure she only has a trace of True Phoenix bloodline?

After a long silence, Manbo, who had just been electrocuting and boosting the water demons, asked:

"Where is Wu Mo?"

"Right! The only hope for us water demons is him!"

"It's not that I don't have faith in our peerless Flood Dragon, but whether he can successfully challenge Luan Bing the Great Demon King is indeed an unknown..."

"Go for it, big brother from the Mingjiao clan!" The water demons clenched their fists, their hearts filled with tension.

"What is that little guy doing?"

Shang Qinqing was a bit curious, so she looked at the monk Kongkong.

*Thump.* Channel changed.
