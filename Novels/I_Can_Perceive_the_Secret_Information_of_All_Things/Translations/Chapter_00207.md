# Chapter 207: Establishing a Private Domain at Yuanshen Temple, The Great Demon King Transforms into a Peacock

After returning to Yuanshen Temple for some time, Xiao Ji had been busy establishing a private domain. Since even the Sacred Hand Liu could create a small private domain with just a fragment of an immortal lamp, he naturally could do the same—perhaps even better.

Although the temple currently faced no dangers—with hardly any suspicious individuals, let alone local villagers coming to burn incense—it was better to be safe than sorry. Setting up a private domain in advance would provide greater security, ensuring peace of mind during his absences.
