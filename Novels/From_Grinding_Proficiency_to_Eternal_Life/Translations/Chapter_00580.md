# Chapter 580: I'm the Best at Torture

The woman's resplendent robes were torn and tattered, exposing large patches of skin. Though stained with blood and stardust, her skin still shone with the luster of white jade.

Her cloud-like long hair was scattered messily across the starlit sand, with several strands stuck by blood scabs to her pale-as-snow yet exquisitely delicate face.

Even in such a wretched state—gravely injured, unconscious, and on the verge of death—her beauty was still breathtaking. She seemed like the most perfect creation meticulously crafted by the Heavenly Dao of this world, embodying all the finest spiritual essence of the universe.

This beauty transcended gender, carrying an air of noble grace and sanctity that stood above the mundane world.

Xu Yunfan watched for a long while before slowly shifting his gaze to her tightly clenched hand.

In her grasp, she held something firmly.

It was a wisp of light that seemed almost tangible.

It emitted a faint, strange golden glow, with a trace of immortal aura weakly radiating from within.

Though it appeared formless and intangible, just a wisp of light no larger than a finger joint, it seemed to be the manifestation of the heaviest laws in the entire Heavenly Realm.

It was this wisp of golden light that emitted a weak yet stable power, protecting the woman's shattered heart meridians and a sliver of her true soul, preventing her from completely perishing.

Immortal Golden Nature.

And it wasn't self-condensed, but rather the Immortal Golden Nature bestowed by the Heavenly Dao's Fruit of Dao.

Once the Fruit of Dao is proven, the Golden Nature naturally gathers to the one who proved the Dao, and it's generally impossible for others to obtain.

This meant that this woman had come into contact with an empty Fruit of Dao!

Moreover, it was a Fruit of Dao with intense vitality, still maintaining its master's primordial essence, which had birthed this Golden Nature.

This was enough to show that this Fruit of Dao was inherently compatible with this woman, yet she had failed to prove the Dao and obtain it.

What a great opportunity!

As long as he traced this wisp of Immortal Golden Nature back to its source, he might just be able to capture a Fruit of Dao from beyond this world.

Xu Yunfan's heart pounded, and his eyes instantly burned with fervor.

He moved like a phantom to the woman's side without the slightest hesitation. His large hand shot out, swift as lightning, directly grabbing for that wisp of light containing the aura of Immortal Golden Nature, which was entwined in the woman's hand.

It didn't feel like a physical object upon contact. Upon careful perception, it was a strange existence, incredibly condensed and carrying the root laws of the world.

The nature of a Fruit of Dao can be illusory, but this Golden Nature could be captured.

The spiritual power within Xu Yunfan's body surged violently. His formidable spiritual power and divine sense enveloped the wisp, attempting to forcibly strip it from the woman.

"Ugh!"

The woman let out a pained, feeble groan, her hand holding the Golden Nature going limp.

The moment the Golden Nature left her hand, the woman's body trembled violently. The little life force she had left, as if its last support had been pulled away, began to drain away at an accelerated rate. Her face instantly turned ashen, like a corpse.

The last faint glimmer of immortal light covering her body went out completely.

Xu Yunfan paid her no mind, sweeping the wisp of Golden Nature—heavy as a star and radiating an eternal, immortal aura—into his sleeve.

The instant it entered his hand, he felt a torrent of vast and mysterious information冲击 his divine sense. It was the aura of a Rooted Fruit of Dao, continuously spreading through his mind.

The Profound Lunar Mirror Fruit of Dao!

Xu Yunfan's heart shook violently, and immense joy filled his heart.

This wisp of Golden Nature pointed directly to the Profound Lunar Mirror Fruit of Dao, which was hidden in the Heavenly Realm.

What is the Profound Lunar Mirror Fruit of Dao?

This Fruit of Dao is the fundamental condensation of the Lunar Path in the Heavenly Realm.

Its essence is like an eternal, unfathomable ice that carries the moonlight of all ages, representing one of the fundamental laws of the Heavenly Realm: the ultimate Yin, the ultimate Cold, and the ultimate Mystery. It is the source and essence of all Yin energy in this world.

This Fruit of Dao possesses the ability to illuminate the essence of all things and trace causality.

It is like a supreme mirror cast by the Heavenly Dao, capable of discerning all illusions, perceiving the truth, and reflecting the flow of causality. It is the ultimate manifestation of insight.

This Fruit of Dao is extraordinary!

Xu Yunfan was inwardly astonished. No wonder, once the Golden Core True Lords of the Taihua Spirit Void Realm get news of a coordinate to an outer realm, they swarm to it like flies sensing a scent.

If it were him, he would naturally do everything he could to bring this world's Fruit of Dao into his own inner world to elevate his own cultivation.

A hidden Fruit of Dao, one that doesn't appear in the Heavenly Realm and is unknown to True Lords!

Xu Yunfan's mind raced, and he immediately became serious.

Although the status of an external Fruit of Dao is not as great as that of a Fruit of Dao within the Taihua Spirit Void Realm, it is still a Fruit of Dao.

If he could use it to temporarily perceive the realm of a Golden Core True Lord, it would naturally bring him immense benefits.

Although this wisp of Golden Nature wasn't perfectly pure and was somewhat mixed, it was enough to instantly elevate his understanding of the Golden Core and the Fruit of Dao to a level that countless cultivators dream of.

'You have captured a trace of innate Golden Nature. Your cultivation has increased.'

Xu Yunfan glanced at his attribute panel.

As his cultivation deepened, the attribute panel now also began to show the term 'cultivation.'

"Insolent! You... you dare..."

A voice, so weak it was almost inaudible, filled with bone-chilling coldness and fury, struggled to escape from the woman's pale lips.

Her eyelashes trembled violently, and she actually forced her eyes open.

These eyes immediately captured Xu Yunfan's attention. Even though her pupils were unfocused and the light in them was dim and on the verge of extinguishing, they still retained the dignity of one who reigns from the heavens and looks down upon all living beings.

It was clearly the kind of aura cultivated by someone who has held a high position for far too long.

Her gaze was locked on Xu Yunfan, filled with humiliation, hatred, and a hint of disbelief.

The Empress of the Heavenly Court, actually being robbed and humiliated by an outer realm demon like this.

But given the current situation, she had to find a way.

"I am... the Empress of this world. Return my Dao path to me... and I can bestow upon you fortune, grant you a thousand profound mysteries."

The Empress struggled to rise, but without the protection of the Golden Nature, her internal injuries were agitated, and she spat out another mouthful of dark golden divine blood containing her life essence. Her aura became even more feeble, like a candle in the wind.

Xu Yunfan found this somewhat amusing. The way she spoke...

It felt as ridiculous as giving money to Qin Shi Huang and then having him appoint you as his great general.

However, despite her extreme weakness, the faint aura she exuded allowed Xu Yunfan to judge her realm.

Peak Foundation Establishment.

And her foundation was incredibly deep.

Xu Yunfan instantly judged her level.

If not for the fall of the Heavenly Emperor, the resulting karmic entanglement, and the fact that he had snatched away her protective Golden Nature, this woman would not have been so easy to subdue.

She must have relied on her innate Golden Nature to live for a period far longer than any Foundation Establishment True Person in the Taihua Spirit Void Realm, allowing her to accumulate such profound cultivation.

Looking at the deep-seated hatred and unyielding stubbornness in the Empress's eyes, a cold, intrigued smile appeared on Xu Yunfan's face.

Time was running out. The Heavenly Emperor's aura on the main battlefield had weakened to the extreme and could vanish at any moment.

The will of the Heavenly Dao was mourning and trembling. He had to end this quickly.

He suddenly leaned down, one hand roughly grabbing the Empress's fair, long, yet blood-stained wrist. His powerful divine sense violently crashed into her shattered and chaotic sea of consciousness.

At the same time, he lowered his voice and asked with an undeniable threat, "Your Majesty the Empress? Heh... what a grand identity. Tell me, in this Heavenly Realm, aside from the Heavenly Emperor and that Western baldie's Fruit of Dao, where exactly is that hidden Fruit of Dao that the Heavenly Dao has concealed?"
