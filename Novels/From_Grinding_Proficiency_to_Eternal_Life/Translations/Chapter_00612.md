Chapter 612: Peak of the Seventh Rank Great Array

Ye Yuan retreated three steps on the waves, the surging waters beneath his feet solidifying like iron and stone.

His brow furrowed for the first time, a true crease forming, and the long sword in his hand emitted a low hum.

Although that previous sword strike was not his full power, it still contained fifty percent of his sword intent. Yet, it was actually blocked head-on by this cultivator from the Primordial Origin Sect?!

"I underestimated you."

Ye Yuan's voice was cold and hard, like the clash of metal.

He never expected that a cultivator skilled in the arts of formations and karma could unleash such a fierce lightning sword attack.

Although it lacked true sword intent, the combination of a sword technique with arcane arts was truly unexpected.

But immediately after, an anger born of being challenged by an ant, mixed with the pride of a sword cultivator, boiled up.

How dare he play with swords in front of him?!

"It's a pity. You only have the form, but not the essence of sword intent. Today, you are destined to die once more."

The white-gold sword light rose again, its momentum even stronger than before. The Big Dipper's starlight flickered in the void behind him, as if it were about to summon the might of the Northern Dipper to completely crush Xu Yunfan and his sword.

"Only the form? Daoist Ye, you speak too soon!"

Xu Yunfan laughed heartily, but a chilling light shone in his eyes.

He had been waiting for this moment of contempt and anger from his opponent.

Just as Ye Yuan's sword momentum reached its peak in an instant.

"The Starry Dipper tilts the heavens, ten thousand spirits return to their positions!"

Xu Yunfan flipped his palm and produced a dark, profound banner.

The banner's pole was neither gold nor wood, its entire body flowing with a dark silver luster that seemed to swallow light. The banner surface looked as if a section of deep night sky had been cut out, with three hundred and sixty-five stars flickering and flowing upon it. It was clearly the Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner.

The banner unfurled like a sea of clouds in an instant, seeming to blot out the sky and sun. The winds and clouds over the East Sea changed abruptly.

*Boom. Rumble.*

Three hundred and sixty-five thick beams of starlight fiercely pierced through the thick clouds, ignoring the daylight, forcibly drawing upon the power of the celestial stars.

The thousand-mile sea area was instantly shrouded in a deep, starry void shadow. The waves solidified like profound ice, and the surging essence of the Kun water was forcibly immobilized by an invisible, great force.

A power of restraint, as if it could grind down all things, descended violently.

Peak of the Seventh Rank, the Zhou Tian Starry Dipper Great Array, complete!

Ye Yuan's pupils constricted.

The magnificent starlight had severed his connection to the source of the Big Dipper's stars.

What shook his mind even more was the seven figures that walked out from within the array.

To the left, a three-headed, six-armed Demon King held a heaven-shaking staff, his body covered in blazing red fur, and his unruly golden eyes burning with a will to burn the seas. It was the Great Sage Equaling Heaven from the celestial realm, Sun Wukong!

To the right stood a silver-armored, three-eyed general, his forehead's divine eye opening and closing, spitting out and inhaling a golden-red light that could see through illusions. It was the True Lord Erlang, Yang Jian.

In the center, a young general with wind and fire wheels on his feet and a fire-tipped spear stirring up sea-burning flames radiated killing intent to the heavens. The Great Deity of the Three Altars and the Sea Assembly, Nezha.

What made the corners of his eyes twitch slightly was the figure Xu Yunfan had deliberately placed at the array's eye.

The soul shadow of Ye Kai, a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, bowed with a bitter smile.

"Uncle... this banner is named 'Star Spirit.' Please... be extremely careful."

This Ye Kai was precisely the Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect who had ambushed Xu Yunfan in the celestial realm's alchemy hall. Unfortunately, he was counter-refined and became a Star Lord within the Star Spirit Banner.

"Little Kai..."

Ye Yuan let out a long breath, his sword heart trembling violently as if struck by a heavy hammer.

Witnessing his own bloodline descendant turn into another's banner spirit with his own eyes—even with his rock-solid sword heart, ripples of emotion were stirred.

"Senior Ye Yuan, forgive my offense."

The phantom of Fei Lun, dressed in the cloud-patterned sword robe of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, appeared. His entire body was entwined with the unique, chilling sword aura of the Chariot of Heaven Sword Seat.

Several other banner spirits, disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect, also condensed within the starlight, their auras locking onto him firmly.

Ye Yuan merely glanced coldly at these people and said nothing.

The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect was a massive sect, naturally divided into many factions. Even under the command of the True Lord who had achieved sword soul mysticism through the Celestial Jade Pivot, including the Ye family, there were other factions vying for power.

"Kill!!"

The demon ape Sun Wukong, having been refined into a banner spirit这段时间, had accumulated a great deal of anger and frustration. He immediately took the lead to strike.

The purple-gold staff stirred the celestial stars, carrying the momentum of a collapsing mountain and overturning the sea as it smashed toward Ye Yuan's celestial spirit.

Its might, amplified by the array's starlight, far exceeded what it had in life.

Ye Yuan's iron sword turned rapidly to block, the clash of metal echoing across the East Sea.

But the attacks came like a tide! Yang Jian's third eye opened in fury, a condensed beam of golden-red illusory-piercing light arriving later but striking first, aiming straight for his brow.

Ye Yuan's fierce sword intent burst forth hastily, shattering the golden light in an instant, only for a scorching flame to fill the air behind him.

Nezha's fire-tipped spear had already shot out like a venomous dragon leaving its cave, thrusting straight for his back heart.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

Ye Yuan's figure blurred into a sword wheel, his long sword moving at speeds beyond its limit to block, parry, deflect, and slash.

Sword light clashed madly with staff shadows, golden light, and spear glints, splashing a sky full of starlight sparks.

Each impact sent ripples through the starry canopy of the Zhou Tian array, shaken by the banner.

The seven Star Lords positioned at the main points of the Zhou Tian Starry Dipper Great Array attacked with the fury of a raging sea, wave after wave, giving him not a single moment to catch his breath.

"The bloodline of Ye Xuan is indeed excellent bait!"

Xu Yunfan stood at the core of the array's eye, his body surrounded by a waterfall of starlight, his hands forming seals to maintain the array's operation, a thoughtful look flashing in his eyes.

"Without her as a lure, how could I have lured you into this Seventh Rank Slaying Immortal Scheme?"

Ye Xuan harbored a great secret. It was likely related to Ye Yuan's opportunity to seek the golden Dao fruit; otherwise, for a major cultivation family, and just being of the uncle generation, it wouldn't have led to such an irreconcilable feud.

With the fierce sword intent Ye Yuan had comprehended, the two couldn't have had any improper relationship.

Most likely, the world Ye Xuan held in her possession was related to Ye Yuan's opportunity to seek the golden Dao, which is why he was so persistent.

After all, blocking someone's path of cultivation is even more heinous than killing their parents.

Ye Yuan suddenly realized.

The chaotic spiritual energy of the East Sea, and Xu Yunfan drawing the essence of the Kun water to create infinite Yin Thunder of the Kun water, were all part of the opponent's carefully chosen killing ground.

The opponent had long calculated that he would必追, and had even used the bloodline connection of the Ye family to set up this deadly trap.

The path of the fierce sword intent belongs to the yang attribute among the 108 Heavenly and Earthly Fiends. Using the essence of the Kun water, a yin attribute, for attack was the most effective counter.

"Ten Thousand Transformations True Dragon, rise!"

Ye Yuan's fierce shout was like a thunderclap from the ninth heaven.

His long sword fiercely stabbed into the solidified sea surface.

A thousand-zhang sword dragon, carrying the violent essence of the Kun water suppressed by the array, shot into the sky. The dragon's roar split the air, actually causing the Zhou Tian Starry Dipper Great Array to shake violently, its starlight flickering!

Xu Yunfan's eyes turned sharp, and he slammed the banner pole into the ground.

"Suppress!"

A dark light flashed within the array.

The phantom of the Seven Kill Peak's Zi Mo True Lord silently appeared, spitting out the abundant earth vein killing aura, transforming it into countless black chains that bound the sword dragon.

Fei Lun's Chariot of Heaven Sword Aura took the opportunity to slash at Ye Yuan's left rib, while Ye Kai's soul shadow also let out a sorrowful long howl. With the helplessness and determination of a banner spirit, he drew upon the Zhou Tian starlight to thrust a life-forfeiting sword light, aiming straight for Ye Yuan's heart's vital point.

As a banner spirit, the first thing is to be loyal to the banner master and know one's place.

This sword strike from Ye Kai, to show his loyalty, was naturally both swift and vicious.

"Scram!!!"

Ye Yuan's hair and beard bristled, and in his furious roar, his fierce sword intent erupted like an ancient volcano.

A majestic sword aura swept out, forcibly repelling the combined attack of the Star Lords.

However, a piercing bright red finally溢出 from the corner of his mouth. The Zhou Tian starlight, like a millstone of heaven and earth, had silently crushed over half of his sword aura.

The hand holding his sword trembled for the first time, a slight but real tremor.

Ye Yuan was injured for the first time.
