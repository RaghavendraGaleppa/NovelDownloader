# Chapter 141: Unexpected and Astonishing Harvest

In the deep darkness of the night, a vast plain stretched, its forests dense.

A half-human-tall yellow weasel, speaking human words, blocked his path. Its yellow fur gleamed like silk. It wore a set of azure-gold armor and a helmet, and a faint electric glow encircled its body, making it appear extraordinary in every way.

"Why are you blocking my path?" Qin Ming asked.

"Youngster, you don't know the immensity of heaven and earth. You've slaughtered all the young wolves of Wolf Ridge, and yet you ask such a question," the weasel said in a preachy, aged tone.

"What does that have to do with you?" Qin Ming asked coolly.

The slender yellow weasel stood there and said, "As fellow members of the wolf clan, they all had to call me Uncle Huang. What do you say?"

Qin Ming scrutinized it, confirming it was a yellow weasel, not any wolf clan member. "If you miss your nephews so much, then go join them. A whole family, neatly reunited."

"My name is Huang Yuan. I don't kill nameless nobodies, youngster. I'll give you a chance to state your name," Huang Yuan slowly drew the black "long blade" from its back. Relative to its size, the jet-black blade was quite long, roughly matching its height.

"You're just a yellow weasel, don't try to act like a grand wolf with me!" Though Qin Ming spoke disparagingly, he didn't dare to be careless, for he truly sensed a considerable danger from this weasel! He drew his blade, staring at the yellow weasel before him.

"In recent years, I've seen many young faces, even more radical than you, filled with fervor. They entered this Land of Divine Demise, wanting to perform the so-called 'slaying demons and vanquishing devils' and 'guarding the border inhabitants'."

Huang Yuan's azure-gold armor clanged. It even used its small paws to adjust its helmet, making it sit straighter, then its paws glowed as it gripped the black blade and pointed it towards its opponent.

Qin Ming was startled. This vibrant great plain was actually called the Land of Divine Demise? He guessed it was related to god-like beings.

Huang Yuan spoke indifferently, "And the result? Guess what happened to those fervent young people? They all died. Hmm, I even have some collectibles: a section of bone from their middle fingers." It tapped a string of bones hanging on its chest with the hilt of its blade, saying, "As the saying goes, 'ten fingers connected to the heart,' these are called 'heart bones.' I've collected thirty-five heart bones. With yours, the number of the Thirty-Six Heavenly Spirits will be complete."

Qin Ming realized this yellow weasel intended to provoke him. However, his killing intent genuinely surged. What it said wasn't false; those were indeed the finger bones of young humans! He didn't act rashly. Although he was a newly awakened, he had accumulated some spiritual radiance and divine wisdom. His instincts and intuition were now exceptionally sharp.

Qin Ming sensed that two other beings were lurking in the shadows, quietly awaiting an opportunity, ready to coordinate with the yellow weasel to deliver a fatal blow. He couldn't help but sigh. Even a weasel understood strategy, attempting to provoke him while preparing to coordinate with hidden accomplices for a perfect ambush.

Huang Yuan smiled faintly and said, "Heh heh, I find the most satisfaction in strangling these fervent young geniuses of yours, because it's like extinguishing the ardor of your entire race, cutting off your future."

Qin Ming moved. He discarded the mother blade of his twin blades, directly unsheathing the Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade. However, he didn't infuse it with Heavenly Radiance Energy for the time being, so it wasn't dazzling.

The yellow weasel was wreathed in intertwining electrical light and commanded the fierce winds. Gripping its blade, it seemed to "ride" it, lifting off the ground with the sound of wind and thunder, moving incredibly fast!

Suddenly, Qin Ming stopped, then charged at extreme speed towards the rear-side. Dazzling Heavenly Radiance erupted from his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade, its pure white body humming.

In the dense forest, the lurking figures turned out to be two humans, a man and a woman, positioned in different directions. They coordinated with the yellow weasel, forming a triangular formation, intending to ambush him from the sides and rear.

Now, Qin Ming turned and charged towards the man, the tyrannical force of wind flowing around him like a passing hurricane, snapping all obstructing branches in its path, and pulverizing much of the vegetation. The gleaming blade light blossomed like a startling clap of thunder in the forest as he cleaved down upon a man around thirty years old.

Undoubtedly, this was an Outer Saint. At this moment, his pupils constricted, and he cried out, "Brother, don't misunderstand! We're on the same side!" However, the jet-black spear in his hand mercilessly thrust forward. If his opponent hesitated even slightly, he would seize the initiative, perhaps even piercing him to death with a single spear thrust.

Qin Ming's blade descended with a clang, severing the black spear in two. Moreover, he didn't pause for even an instant. The Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade in his hand erupted with Heavenly Radiance like a dazzling sun.

"You..." The Outer Saint panicked. This was actually a Jade Iron Blade! He tried to dodge, but found his speed utterly inferior to his opponent's. He tried to block with the broken spear, but before the Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade, it was like rotten wood, utterly fragile. Amidst clanging sounds, it was whittled down to a mere foot in length. Qin Ming's final strike fell, severing the remaining piece of the broken spear and, with it, the man's arm. Blood splattered.

The man's scream had barely begun before Qin Ming cleaved his body in two with a single strike. His Heavenly Radiance Energy couldn't be blocked; he died a tragic death on the spot.

Qin Ming spun around abruptly, for the yellow weasel had arrived, moving at an absurd speed. It was wreathed in lightning and accompanied by fierce winds, its feet not touching the ground—it truly seemed to be blade-riding.

*Clang!*

Though Huang Yuan was small, only reaching an adult man's waist, its strength was astonishing. It clashed blades with Qin Ming, emitting a piercing metallic clang. Its black "long blade" developed a serious gash. One could imagine that the material of this blade was quite extraordinary; it hadn't snapped in two even after being struck by the Jade Iron Blade. This was a spoil of war the yellow weasel had obtained after killing a human young genius.

"So powerful!" It was quite shocked. How could a human of this age withstand it? It was considered an aged demon, having evolved for many years. Even many Outer Saints among humans were not its match, and it had even enslaved two of them. Yet, a newcomer, barely a teenager, was able to contend against it head-on!

In an instant, the two exchanged dozens of blows, sparks flying. Finally, a section of the weasel's black blade broke off, its tip falling to the ground. Its heart fluttering with panic, it quickly retreated, creating some distance.

Qin Ming naturally wouldn't let it go, pursuing closely, clinging to it, and continuing to clash blades. He was truly astonished that this yellow weasel actually wielded a very powerful blade art, and its mastery was profound, as if it had practiced for decades, possessing a distinct master's demeanor. In fact, this weasel was indeed very talented. It had achieved the demeanor of a renowned master after only a dozen years of blade practice. It could be considered a "prodigy" among aberrant creatures.

However, the yellow weasel was even more shocked: it was at a disadvantage! It was in the Land of Divine Demise where its bloodline had mutated, evolving wisps of peculiar blood, which was equivalent to gaining decades of cultivation. Yet, it was actually inferior to a human teenager.

The female Outer Saint tried several times to assist Huang Yuan, but her speed couldn't keep up, so she retreated again. Qin Ming and the yellow weasel continuously exchanged blows, fully displaying his profound mastery of the blade. He had already cleaved open its azure-gold armor, leaving two wounds on its body.

Huang Yuan was enraged. It truly couldn't block this teenager. It prided itself on being a blade art master, renowned on this plain, but now it was finding it increasingly difficult. With a clang, its black "long blade" broke into two. Its chest armor was sliced open, armor plates shattered, and another deep gash appeared.

With a whoosh, it actually soared into the sky, flying into the night! When it had been blade-riding earlier, it had a pair of hidden fleshy wings, subtly vibrating behind it. Now, they were fully spread, supporting it in the air.

"Unbelievable! I, Master Huang, renowned across the Divine Demise Plain for my Wind-Thunder Blade, have actually been defeated by a mere greenhorn!" The yellow weasel fumed.

Qin Ming's face was cold. He was very dissatisfied with himself; to fight a yellow weasel for such a long time was utterly ridiculous! He didn't know the true caliber of this yellow weasel; its reputation was indeed very great!

Qin Ming ignored it, gripping his blade as he walked towards the woman.

She quickly spoke, "I was forced to help it. For the past few years, I've been enslaved by it. Thank you for coming to rescue me today."

"I see you're not muddled and can communicate normally, yet you acted as an accomplice earlier. You must have shed a lot of your own kin's blood these past few years, haven't you?" Qin Ming asked.

"No, please don't! I was wrong!" The woman panicked, her face turning pale. Even Master Huang wasn't his match; how could she possibly resist?

Qin Ming struck without mercy. After several fierce clashes, with a *thud*, he sent the woman's head flying, blood spurting as her corpse toppled to the ground.

Huang Yuan in mid-air was far from simple. It had mastered human Heavenly Radiance Energy, but now it had fully retracted it, and brilliant multi-colored light emanated from its glabella. It hadn't intervened just now because it was transforming its own power!

"Many people have forgotten what I relied on to rise to prominence back then." As a yellow weasel, it possessed a racial innate ability: an exceptionally powerful spiritual domain. It retracted its Heavenly Radiance Energy, and dazzling spiritual radiance burst forth from its forehead bone, seemingly twisting space, causing the tall tree canopy beside it to violently shake, then shatter.

It swooped down, roaring, "Those who rely on physical bodies for combat are all inferior beings!"

Qin Ming really wanted to cleave it to death with one strike. This yellow weasel actually practiced species discrimination, did it think itself full of immortal aura? When the power of its so-called spiritual domain poured down, its radiance transforming into tangible long blades that cleaved towards Qin Ming, he directly clenched his fist and blasted it upwards.

Qin Ming's unified fist light was incomparably dazzling, like a golden crow spreading its wings and tearing through the night sky, incinerating all things. The so-called spiritual radiance was instantly ignited. The tangible "spirit blades" fractured, dispersed, and turned into fiery light. Furthermore, a five-strike combo followed, but they were all pierced through by Qin Ming's terrifying Heavenly Radiance Energy, like a three-legged golden crow sweeping through the long night, vanquishing all demons and monsters.

"Ah..." Huang Yuan shrieked. It had never imagined that after converting all its power and employing its most powerful consciousness radiance, it would be defeated even more miserably. Its mouth and nose were filled with blood. It flapped its fleshy wings, fleeing into the night sky, wanting to escape this place.

Qin Ming drew his bow and notched an arrow, and he used a jet-black Jade Iron Arrow! His archery was renowned as exceptional, no weaker than his blade art.

Huang Yuan, already heavily wounded, couldn't dodge at all. It let out a shrill scream as its body was blasted open with a bloody hole by the Heavenly Radiance contained within the arrow, plummeting towards the ground. The Heavenly Radiance that passed through its body even tore one of its fleshy wings!

Qin Ming moved through the forest like an agile leopard, instantly arriving before it and stepping on its body. Immediately, his expression changed, for he saw it inhaling deeply.

Qin Ming brought his blade down, using the blunt side to smash one of its legs, threatening, "Don't you dare release your foul odor, or I'll immediately chop off all your limbs!" He didn't want to smell putrid. He pressed the Jade Iron Blade against its neck.

"What do you want?" the yellow weasel asked, trembling.

Qin Ming said, "I'm very interested in your lightning glow and that blade art. Recite them to me."

"You let me go first," Huang Yuan said, trying to negotiate terms.

*Crack!* Its arms were snapped by Qin Ming using the Jade Iron Blade.

"I concede..." Huang Yuan lowered its head and began reciting a problematic scripture.

*Crack!* Two more bones in its body snapped.

Qin Ming said coldly, "Recite it again. If it's different each time, if there's any error, I'll snap two more of your bones."

Huang Yuan's emotions fluctuated wildly. The grievances, and the images presented by the scriptures it recalled, were all incomparably clear.

Qin Ming was certain he had obtained the complete legacy. The lightning glow and blade art he desired were actually part of a single legacy—the Wind-Thunder Blade, which needed to be activated with Wind-Thunder Energy. This secret manual came from a young genius who, unfortunately, had been killed over a decade ago. Back then, the world's edge wasn't so chaotic. Huang Yuan had secretly acted, killing that fervent young genius. Moreover, what it had said was true: in recent years, it had successively killed over thirty human genius experts.

Qin Ming naturally wouldn't let it go. After obtaining this very mysterious and formidable blade art manual, he cleaved the yellow weasel in half at the waist with a single strike.

"You..." It shrieked. Though filled with terror, it didn't immediately die. From its heart region, purple mist emanated, surging towards its wound, and a fragrant aroma diffused into the air.

"This is..." Qin Ming was startled. He then decapitated the yellow weasel, giving it no chance to live.

Not long after, he discovered a purple heart within its corpse, containing some special blood.

"Could this be the special aberrant creature mentioned in the Fate-Altering Scripture, one that evolved 'Marvelous Blood' capable of extending life and enhancing innate talent? This yellow weasel is actually so astonishing?!"

Qin Ming was lost in thought. Just a weasel, yet it had actually birthed "Marvelous Blood"! To be recorded in the Fate-Altering Scripture, this was naturally no ordinary item.

Qin Ming examined it carefully, feeling both joy and regret. The quantity of "Marvelous Blood" wasn't much. This yellow weasel was still in its growth stage. If it had accumulated for several more decades or even a century, and its entire body had transformed into Marvelous Blood, then it truly would have been priceless. He estimated that, according to the records in the Fate-Altering Scripture, this amount of blood could extend his lifespan by ten years and also strengthen his foundation! This was even more precious than spiritual substances that could aid in rebirth. Because this was about increasing potential, whereas spiritual substances merely helped to manifest potential.

Using the methods recorded in the Fate-Altering Scripture, Qin Ming unleashed Heavenly Radiance to refine the Marvelous Blood, causing wisps of purple mist to emanate from it. This was the "marvelous medicine" contained within the purple blood. For a moment, purple mist billowed, and a medicinal fragrance filled the air, enveloping him.

After purifying it dozens of times with Heavenly Radiance, Qin Ming inhaled the billowing purple clouds into his body. Instantly, he felt his entire body lighten, and the vitality of his flesh and blood increased.

"The effect is this obvious?" He was astonished. Marvelous medicine could extend life and alter one's blood, flesh, and bone structure; he had already felt it. This "Marvelous Blood" shocked him!

Qin Ming carefully experienced it. He felt that his own foundation had indeed solidified, though he didn't know by how much. On his way back, he was already practicing the techniques from that secret manual. The Wind-Thunder Energy not only possessed extremely strong offensive power but could also greatly increase speed! The value of this blade art manual far exceeded his earlier expectations. Qin Ming speculated that it must be a unique absolute art from some great sect.

He continuously swung his blade, gradually emitting the sounds of wind and thunder. The lightning glow he had been longing for was subtly appearing! Qin Ming no longer wanted to leave. The Land of Divine Demise was full of opportunities. He wanted to encounter a few more "Master Huangs." This harvest had left him immensely satisfied.
