# Chapter 30: I Choose Lin Yun! He's the People's Choice!

Outside the stone houses of the Qi Condensation disciples, newly admitted sect members stopped to watch the commotion as they noticed a large crowd gathered before Han Li's residence.

"Whose cave dwelling is that? Why are there so many people? And several Foundation Establishment cultivators too?"

"That area is supposed to be for new disciples, isn't it?"

"Did some clueless new disciple offend a young master, and now they've come for revenge?" speculated one onlooker eagerly anticipating drama.

"Tsk—another poor soul about to suffer."

"Probably some pampered young master from the mortal world who can't swallow his pride after joining the Yellow Maple Valley. A few hard lessons should teach him."

"This happens every year. Some just can't handle the status drop—I heard one even died from depression."

"Does anyone know who lives there?" another disciple asked, pointing at the group's attire. "Those outsiders don't look ordinary—their robes suggest they're from the Chen Family."

A collective gasp rose among the Qi Condensation disciples at the mention of the Chen Family.

"The Chen Family? One of the Three Great Clans?!"

"To provoke such a force... that guy's cultivation journey ends here."

"But that young man leading them looks unfamiliar. A new generation of the Chen Family?"

"And he's not wearing their robes..."

Lin Yun's entourage drew attention not just from Qi Condensation disciples but even passing Foundation Establishment managers who cast curious glances.

Among the crowd was an unassuming, shrewd-looking old man at the eleventh layer of Qi Condensation—Xiang Zhili, one of Yellow Maple Valley's tens of thousands of ordinary Qi Condensation disciples.

Creak—

Han Li pushed open his wooden door and stepped out, startled by the sea of people outside.

"Brother Lin, why have you brought so many—"

Before he could finish, Lin Yun strode forward and punched his shoulder lightly. "You rascal! Didn't I say I'd have your back?"

"Why didn't you tell me about your Foundation Establishment Pill being stolen? If not for a senior brother mentioning it, I'd never have known!"

"Stealing from my brother is stealing from me!"

Lin Yun fixed Han Li with a stern look. "Did you not consider me a brother? Why keep this from me?"

"Brother Lin, you've already done so much for me. How could I trouble you further?" Han Li replied with a bitter smile, his eyes glistening.

---

Lin Yun—this was family.

In the desolate expanse of Yellow Maple Valley, in the heartless world of cultivation, someone actually cared for Han Li like this.

This was his true elder brother!

No—even his blood brother hadn't treated him this well.

"Between brothers, such words are too distant! Your matters are mine!"

"Come, let's reclaim your Foundation Establishment Pill!" Lin Yun declared, patting Han Li's shoulder.

Wiping his eyes, Han Li hesitated. "Brother Lin, the thief is a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator. Won't this cause you trouble? Maybe we should let it go..."

"Just a Foundation Establishment Pill—I can find another way later."

Let it go? Lin Yun would never voice his true thought—Who'll compensate me for my Body Refining Pills and spirit item gift box? Instead, he feigned righteous fury. "Let it go? How can we let this go?!"

"I, Lin Yun, despise such bullying most in this life!"

"A mere mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator? Easy prey for me!"

"The audacity of this minor mid-Foundation cultivator!"

Lin Yun gestured to the dozen Foundation Establishment experts behind him—young and old alike.

"See these Foundation Establishment cultivators? One late-stage, five mid-stage, eleven early-stage. Enough for you?"

The eldest among them smiled kindly. "Young friend Han, set your heart at ease. This matter is trivial. With this old man and the Chen Family backing you, that Ye Ming wouldn't dare seek revenge."

As he spoke, he studied Han Li. He'd heard from Qiaoqian about Lin Yun's close friend, but Han Li seemed utterly unremarkable. Still, his orders were clear—follow Lin Yun's lead without question.

And these orders came not from the family head, but higher authority.

Han Li stared at Lin Yun in awe, envy flickering in his heart.

Both were newcomers to Yellow Maple Valley, yet Lin Yun commanded Foundation Establishment experts while Han Li had been robbed by one.

The gap between them was like heaven and earth.

But this was his Brother Lin. Though envious, Han Li felt no jealousy.

Handsome and kind-hearted, Lin Yun deserved every bit of his talent and status.

Han Li had never met anyone as virtuous and good-looking as his Brother Lin.

---

As the saying goes—the handsome are blessed by heaven!

After reassuring Han Li, Lin Yun addressed the surrounding Qi Condensation disciples.

"Everyone, attention!"

"I have an announcement!"

"Let justice be heard!"

The onlookers watched curiously. They'd assumed Lin Yun came for vengeance, but the two seemed close.

"This is my sworn brother Han Li. He joined Yellow Maple Valley with an Ascension Token, which grants a Foundation Establishment Pill—as you all know."

"But a shameless old thief named Ye, abusing his mid-Foundation Establishment power, forced my brother to 'sell' his pill for scraps! He even had the gall to call it a purchase!"

"Not only did he steal the pill, he brutally beat my brother, leaving him crippled and bedridden!"

As Lin Yun recounted Han Li's plight, the Qi Condensation disciples' expressions darkened with shared grief. Most had suffered similar exploitation—whether through withheld spirit stones, underpriced herbs, or unpaid labor. But Han Li's loss of a Foundation Establishment Pill dwarfed their grievances.

Seeing the mood ripe, Lin Yun raised his fist. "Heaven's justice is clear—men may be deceived, but conscience cannot! Karma is impartial—the universe sees all!"

"What say you all?!"

Silence. The cowed crowd's lack of response made Lin Yun feel as if crows cawed overhead in mockery. "Pathetic! So broken by oppression you've forgotten how to resist!"

"Fine—I'll do it myself!"

With a flick of his robe, Lin Yun crushed a talisman. Instantly, voices rose from the crowd:

"Justice is dead! The sect leader is unjust!"

"We need someone to uphold fairness!"

"I agree!"

"I choose Lin Yun!"

"He's the people's choice!"

The overlapping shouts made it impossible to pinpoint speakers. Then, like a rising tide, the chant began:

"Lin Yun! Lin Yun! Lin Yun!"

---

The chorus swelled until nearly everyone joined in.

"Who is Lin Yun? Can he really help us?" asked one still-rational disciple, scratching his head.

"Who cares? Just enjoy the show. Whether he can deliver justice—we'll see if he retrieves Han Li's pill," replied another, pausing his chant.

"Right..." The disciple nodded and joined the chorus.

"Lin Yun! Lin Yun! Lin Yun!"
