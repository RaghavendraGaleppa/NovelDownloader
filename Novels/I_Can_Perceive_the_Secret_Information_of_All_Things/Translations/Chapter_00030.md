# Chapter 30: Extraordinary Good News

After returning to the Origin God Temple for several days, Xiao Ji carefully stored the spirit stones and the Thunderbolt Sword he had obtained in his storage pendant. As for the storage brick, it had a special purpose—it was reserved for precious treasures. He replaced one of the bricks under his bed with it, ensuring extra security.

The acquisition of spirit stones had opened new possibilities for him. By merely eliminating the weak Cuckoo Gang, he had obtained over three hundred spirit stones. However, this unexpected windfall didn't cloud his judgment. Xiao Ji knew such opportunities were rare, and hard work remained the true path to prosperity.

The fragments of the Nine Treasures were incredibly valuable and beneficial for cultivation, but they didn't seem particularly useful to Xiao Ji. After all, his method of increasing his cultivation differed from that of other practitioners. Yet, the benefits of collecting all nine treasures were something he deeply desired. Who wouldn't aspire to immortality and longevity through cultivation? Moreover, the ability to withstand heavenly tribulations made it even more enticing.

No suspicious individuals had come looking for him, indicating that he had left no loose ends. Xiao Ji finally relaxed completely.

The weather was pleasant today, so he decided to go out and buy a roast chicken and a few jars of good wine for his master. Lately, his master had been in a sour mood, upset that Xiao Ji hadn't brought back any souvenirs from his travels.

After purchasing the food, Xiao Ji set the table in the dining hall and helped his master sit down. The sight of wine and meat lifted the old man's spirits slightly. Observing his master's aged face, Xiao Ji decided to secretly examine his health. With his newfound ability to perceive the hidden information of all things, diagnosing an illness was effortless.

The results of the examination left Xiao Ji puzzled.

**[Liu Haizhu, Master of the Origin God Temple, Qi Refining Stage 2, Age 76, Remaining Lifespan: 25 years, 1 month, 15 days, 3 ke (刻), and 7 xi (息)...]**

"This doesn't make sense," Xiao Ji muttered.

He clearly remembered the first time he had used his perception ability on his master. Back then, the information had shown Qi Refining Stage 3, age 80, with a remaining lifespan of 26 years, 3 months, 24 days, 9 ke, and 15 xi. Now, his master's cultivation had regressed, and his lifespan had shortened—yet his body showed no signs of illness. In fact, he seemed remarkably healthy. It was truly baffling.

"Master, while I was away, did you eat anything unusual?" Xiao Ji asked.

"Is there anything in this world that's truly clean?" Liu Haizhu replied, tearing off a chicken leg and taking a bite.

Asking the old man directly wouldn't yield answers, so Xiao Ji decided to consult Yingxiao instead, hoping to learn about his master's recent activities and interactions.

It was already noon, and Yingxiao had retreated to her room after breakfast, staying inside without a word about her activities.

The dining hall of the Origin God Temple was some distance from Yingxiao's room, but it was still within forty zhang (about 120 meters). This meant Xiao Ji could gather the information he needed simply by sitting at the dining table.

Channeling his spiritual energy, he activated his perception.

**[Third Princess Yingxiao, sitting cross-legged on a chair in her warm room, wearing a red bellyband, is diligently writing in her diary.]**

Xiao Ji recalled that when he first met Yingxiao at the Lu residence, she had been fond of recording things. So, it turned out she kept a diary. Her upbringing must have been meticulous—even while running away from home and living as a wanderer, she still maintained the habit of writing.

Curiosity got the better of him, and he focused his attention on the thick diary, skimming through a few entries to gauge the princess's literary flair.

**[Day 99 of Running Away from Home: I’ve settled into the Origin God Temple in Willow Town. There are two Taoist priests here. The old one is impressive—he’s said to have pulled out a dragon’s sinew and slain a demon king... He could be appointed as a state preceptor... The young one is handsome—perfect for a royal consort...]**

**[Day 123 of Running Away from Home: Light snow. Had buns in the morning, rice and ribs at noon...]**

**[Day 127 of Running Away from Home: The weather is gloomy, and I’m feeling listless. I can’t waste my time like this. I’m a remarkable woman destined to overthrow the dynasty—I can’t squander my youth in the Origin God Temple. I plan to leave soon and explore the lives of the common people elsewhere...]**

Upon sensing this, Xiao Ji decided to intervene and alter Yingxiao’s mindset. A delicate princess who couldn’t even hold onto three taels of silver would undoubtedly perish if she continued wandering. This golden goose couldn’t be allowed to fall into someone else’s hands.

"This chicken rump looks awful—do you want it?" Liu Haizhu asked, his mouth greasy from eating as he downed a cup of wine.

"Would you give it to me if I said yes?" Xiao Ji replied, eyeing the piece of meat.

"Of course not... Here, you can have this chicken breast instead."

"Then why ask? I’ll eat later."

"Just wanted to chat with you a bit."

After this brief exchange, Xiao Ji decided to call Yingxiao for lunch and subtly dissuade her from leaving the temple.

When Yingxiao arrived in the dining hall, Liu Haizhu offered her the remaining chicken leg. "Here, girl, I saved this for you. Almost lost it to someone else earlier."

With only three people present, the remark was clearly aimed at Xiao Ji. "When did I ever try to take the chicken leg? Master’s memory is getting worse—almost like he’s delusional. Maybe he needs some walnuts to sharpen his mind," Xiao Ji thought, his expression darkening slightly.

"Master, don’t forget to read the book I gave you. It’ll help your memory. Next time you play chess with Old Liu, you’ll dominate," Xiao Ji reminded him.

"Oh, that book?" Liu Haizhu pondered for a moment. "I already gave it to Old Liu. His memory’s been slipping—always taking back his moves. Annoying."

As the three ate, Xiao Ji, after finishing his meal, remarked, "I’ve learned a lot from this trip, but the world is truly dangerous. I’ve heard many demons prey on wanderers, especially pretty girls—their fates are particularly gruesome. Some demons have even learned to cook—frying legs, arms, even heads..."

Yingxiao shuddered, the vivid imagery making it seem as though these horrors were tailor-made for her. She immediately resolved to stay at the Origin God Temple.

After lunch, Xiao Ji went to the main hall. Though the temple’s reputation had improved slightly, devotees were still scarce.

At the first ke of the Wei hour (around 1:00 PM), a visitor arrived at the Origin God Temple.

The man wore sturdy leather boots, a tiger-mouth belt, a regulation longsword, and a finely stitched red-and-black constable’s uniform. His face was slightly square—it was Song Yuanbao.

Before he even stepped through the gate, Xiao Ji had already sensed his presence.

"Good news! Wonderful news! Extraordinary good news!" Song Yuanbao exclaimed excitedly as he entered the main hall and spotted Xiao Ji.

Xiao Ji gestured to a nearby table. "Sit and speak slowly."

Song Yuanbao noticed two cups of tea already poured.

After quickly draining one cup, the constable cleared his throat and said, "Guess what the good news is, Daoist Xiao."

Withholding information was a tactic to build suspense and amplify the impact of the revelation.

Xiao Ji took a sip of tea. "Could it be that the Dragon City’s Demon-Suppression Bureau has issued a decree? To meet the needs of cultivators, spirit stones will no longer require silver for exchange—they’ll be distributed directly by local government offices?"

The grand hall fell silent, as if a stone had lodged itself in Song Yuanbao’s chest.

After a long pause, the constable said dejectedly, "So... you already knew."

"Any important cases lately?" Xiao Ji asked, realizing his joke might have dampened the man’s enthusiasm. It wasn’t right to crush the spirit of someone eager to share news.

Song Yuanbao pulled out a small notebook where he recorded cases and flipped through it. "Based on your interests, this one might appeal to you. It’s bizarre—though it didn’t happen in Willow Town. It occurred in Chuyun Town just before noon today. They sent a fast horse to request assistance from neighboring offices. My superiors assigned me to it—I’m on my way there now."

"Tell me about it," Xiao Ji said thoughtfully.

"In Longxiang County’s Chuyun Town, a merchant named Cui Budu was found dead," Song Yuanbao explained. "At the time of his death, everyone in the Kaishan Escort Agency he had contact with was also found dead..."

Hearing this, Xiao Ji immediately thought of the Four-String Pipa fragments—specifically, the old string that was in Cui Budu’s possession. The information he had received warned that the Cui family’s fortune had been reversed by the string’s curse, and disaster was inevitable.

But he hadn’t expected it to strike so soon—and so fatally.

"I’m quite interested in this case," Xiao Ji said, finishing his tea in one gulp. "Constable Song, would you mind if I accompanied you to investigate?"

Song Yuanbao had come to the Origin God Temple precisely for this purpose.
