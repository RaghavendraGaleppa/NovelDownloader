# Chapter 275: Shattering Illusions, Discovering the Secret of the Secret Realm

Emerging from the second illusion, Xiao Ji found himself holding an iron spear artifact—the very same one he had gripped when entering the illusion. It was identical in shape, down to the rust marks in the same spots.

Suddenly, he understood Han Sandian's joy. He realized why the former Spear Immortal always clung to his iron spear. Beyond the feel of it, there was a profound sense of security that brought calmness, making one feel utterly complete.

The spear in his hand now wasn't as high-grade as Han Sandian's. However, Han's spear had been nearly drained of its power by suppression. Only when its master regained his former strength would the spear restore its past might.

Xiao Ji decided to give this one to Han Sandian upon returning—if the former Spear Immortal was willing to accept it.

Storing the artifact, Xiao Ji stepped into the third illusion of the Hundred Weapons Long Street.

Once he passed this final barrier, he would face the last blacksmith shop.

He glanced back at Zhao Jiuzhou and Fan Dali, who remained frozen in place. Without external help, they clearly couldn't break free on their own.

While the third illusion was the most challenging for most, it was the simplest for Xiao Ji.

It was a martial arts hall.

Xiao Ji appeared in the courtyard of the hall, facing an array of eighteen weapons.

He needed to choose one from the weapon rack to duel the hall's master.

"Choose your weapon, lest others say I bullied you," a dignified voice sounded ahead.

Looking up, Xiao Ji saw an elderly man descending gracefully from the high steps, hands clasped behind his back, chin lifted at a forty-five-degree angle—the picture of pride.

"Am I here to challenge the hall?" Xiao Ji mused as he surveyed his surroundings before settling his gaze on the old man.

Since he was asked to choose a weapon and eighteen options were displayed, the key to breaking the illusion must lie in the selection. Choose correctly, and he could leave alive; choose wrong, and he might be trapped in endless duels.

Illusions sometimes defied logic more than dreams.

[You are in an illusion where you're experiencing a martial arts challenge... The hall master is a grandmaster proficient in all eighteen weapons, knowing every strength and weakness. He can easily spot flaws in his opponents' techniques and defeat them...]

[This master has faced ninety-nine challenges without a single loss.]

This was the most direct description of the illusion, clarifying Xiao Ji's task and his opponent's capabilities.

His goal was to break the illusion, not engage in a duel. Since the master had never lost, and the illusion was pre-designed, there must be a trick.

Xiao Ji continued analyzing the illusion, hoping to quickly find an exit.

"Young man, hurry and choose your weapon. I'll face you bare-handed," the old master said. "I always give challengers an advantage. If you don't pick a weapon, I'll feel guilty. My hands are ruthless—I don't hold back. Breaking a weapon is fine; it can be reforged. But if I break your arms, legs, or ribs, that would be unfortunate..."

From the master's demeanor, Xiao Ji sensed the pride of a seasoned martial artist. Yet even without his perception ability, he detected something amiss in the old man's words.

"Why does he insist I choose a weapon?" Xiao Ji wondered.

It was indeed strange and worth pondering.

[If you fail the challenge, you'll be trapped in this illusion.]

[Victory means freedom.]

So it came down to a duel—win or lose determined whether he could leave. But with ninety-nine prior challengers, ninety-nine others had fallen into this illusion before him, all lost forever.

[This imposing white-haired master excels with the eighteen weapons but knows nothing beyond them. His weakness lies outside the eighteen weapons.]

The solution emerged.

"No wonder he insists on the eighteen weapons. That's the catch," Xiao Ji realized, formulating his plan.

Illusions and formations followed the same principle—aligned with the Great Dao. Of the fifty paths of the Great Dao, forty-nine were revealed, leaving one hidden... Everything in existence held a sliver of hope, existing only to be found or missed, never absent.

Thus, the sole flaw in this illusion was combat beyond the eighteen weapons.

Finding no alternative weapons—not even a stone on the ground—Xiao Ji could only rely on his fists.

"Avoid the eighteen weapons, challenge the hall with something beyond them, and it's done," he muttered, charging forward.

His speed wasn't extreme, allowing the opponent time to react. The illusion also lacked spiritual energy, isolating it like a low-level martial arts duel. Barring surprises, it would be a simple exchange of punches and kicks.

Xiao Ji's sudden move stunned the white-haired master.

He wasn't following the script.

One punch to the eye socket made the master see stars. A kick to the groin brought the sound of cracking eggshells... The master had no chance to react.

Three punches, two kicks—no more were needed.

The master of eighteen weapons lay defeated.

"Cheap shot," the master groaned. "Young man, you lack martial virtue! Don't you know the rules?"

"My apologies, elder. I'm truly unfamiliar with the customs," Xiao Ji replied humbly, maintaining courtesy even toward an illusory figure.

"This is chaos! I told you to choose from the eighteen weapons. Surely one caught your eye?" The master, too weak to rise, lamented, "Instead, you just threw punches and kicks..."

As the master lay still, Xiao Ji's victory triggered the illusion's dissolution, returning him to reality.

He pressed onward.

The three illusions of Hundred Weapons Long Street were known beforehand. With them cleared, the path to the blacksmith shop at the street's end lay open.

As he passed, curious heads peeked from smaller blacksmith shops—artifact spirits and strange beings observing the Daoist. They didn't yet know what changes he would bring.

Through the three illusions, Xiao Ji understood their origin—they were experiences of an ancient mighty figure before his enlightenment. That figure had been an ordinary man, once a cook who ruined a dish of fried rice in exhaustion.

Enraged, the customer drove him out without pay, adding a beating.

Leaving his hometown to join the military, he accidentally enlisted with rebels and was sent as a spy. After their defeat, he fled abroad, seeking a master to cultivate. But the master tasked him with challenging a martial hall.

Naturally, he was beaten out.

Deeming himself ill-fated, he stumbled upon an open blacksmith shop during a downpour. The shirtless smith welcomed him in, offering warmth, water, and bread.

By the forge's glow, he glimpsed the essence of fire and the transformation of materials within.

Thus began his path to enlightenment.

Breaking the illusions granted Xiao Ji fragments of the ancient figure's past—his acquisition of the Thunder Pool Sword and creation of the Hundred Weapons Secret Realm. Why he vanished remained a mystery.

Xiao Ji now stood before the colossal blacksmith shop at the street's end—a structure as grand as a palace.

[The three illusions have vanished.]

This was unexpected. The reason? No one had ever shattered all three illusions simultaneously. Most were trapped in the first.

Looking back, he saw Zhao Jiuzhou and Fan Dali freed from their illusions, dazed before approaching.

"Brother Xiao, I feel... odd," Zhao Jiuzhou said. "In the illusion, I think I became a wok."

Seeing Zhao Jiuzhou's flattened, concave body with a small handle-like head and long, fused legs, Xiao Ji confirmed, "You are a wok now."

Fan Dali trembled incessantly.

They recounted their experiences—similar to Xiao Ji's, but they'd failed to break free. Prolonged entrapment would have warped their forms permanently.

"I feel like a wok craving fire, yearning for sizzling oil, even embracing vegetables..." Zhao Jiuzhou's skin had darkened.

"I was fried rice, tossed by a spatula... The wok's flip was oddly satisfying," Fan Dali said, his perspective skewed—perhaps by hunger.

Handing each half of a Mind-Clearing Pill, Xiao Ji restored them to normal within an incense stick's time.

With his companions recovered, Xiao Ji led them into the massive blacksmith shop.

The iron doors swung open as if welcoming customers. Blazing heat surged forth from roaring furnaces, surrounded by massive artifacts—hammers, shears, and more.

The moment they entered, the doors slammed shut behind them.

"These artifacts are at least Mystic-grade. This is a treasury!" Zhao Jiuzhou's eyes gleamed with greed.

As an artifact cultivator, he was defenseless against such temptation—especially the grand furnace capable of refining heaven-grade artifacts with low-tier spirit stones.

"Strictly speaking, this is the true Hundred Weapons Secret Realm. The outer city and空地 exist solely to protect it," Xiao Ji explained. "The realm is named for its hundred superior artifacts, each unique in function and form."

"Take these shears—they appear ordinary but can clip spiritual herbs, even immortal plants."

"This furnace hook can stir the molten depths..."

They wandered the enormous shop, surrounded by oversized tools.

Xiao Ji delved into the shop's secrets, soon uncovering the realm's greatest mystery—its creator's fate.

[The ancient artifact master, Immortal Ten Thousand Flames, sought eternal life through artifacts after attaining immortality. Upon obtaining the Thunder Pool Sword, he conceived a method—to forge himself into an artifact. Eternal artifact, eternal life...]

[He acted on it, blending celestial iron with his blood, mixing flesh and organs with spiritual herbs, tempering all into the metal. Finally, he leaped into the furnace, bones and all...]

[The result was a peculiar artifact resembling a plunger, crafted from eternal celestial iron. Yet he could no longer move as before, confined to the shop. Stripped of immortal power, he was now merely a strange artifact capable of crushing Nascent Soul cultivators...]

"A ruthless man," Xiao Ji mused. "To dare think it, then forge himself..."

[Cursed by the Heavenly Dao, he failed.]

All who defied heaven's will—beasts, demons, or immortals—were inevitably punished. Thus, the realm's master never left, becoming a twisted creation while his artifact spirits believed he'd merely stepped out.

"Noble guest, what artifact do you seek to forge?" a resonant voice echoed.

The question posed, the answer held grave importance.

[Immortal Ten Thousand Flames' lingering soul drifts within the shop, awaiting the strong—those at Nascent Soul realm or beyond...]

[He yearns to move freely, to leave. But the furnace's flames bind him. Only by refining nine Nascent Soul cultivators can the heavenly curse be lifted...]

Xiao Ji saw five Nascent Soul cultivators.

Though they could hardly be called alive anymore.
