# Chapter 98: Thunder Hell

Han had flown tens of thousands of miles.  

The color of the land beneath his feet grew increasingly lighter, gradually shifting from black to a metallic hue. He could clearly sense that the thunder qi in this area was becoming denser.  

Large quantities of ranked metals had gathered here, and compared to the regions near Iron-Eater City, the earth qi was far more complex. Along the way, Han had encountered multiple [Earth Suction] death zones, their frequency and intensity far surpassing what he had seen before.  

Suddenly, Han stopped mid-flight, hovering in the air!  

Just ahead of him, violent thunder qi was rapidly gathering. Endless bolts of thunder mana radiated from it, far exceeding the scale and power of the thunderclouds Han could summon with his [Thunder Summoning] technique.  

Han observed carefully, analyzing the fluctuations of the mana. He was assessing whether he could truly withstand such intense thunder strikes.  

No one understood the experience of being struck by lightning better than he did.  

Yet, he remained cautious.  

The thunder mana grew stronger and stronger until, upon reaching a critical point, a thunder calamity was born—  

[Thunder Hell]!  

This was the most terrifying natural disaster in Reed Continent. Boundless thunder mana engulfed a vast area, refining all qi and matter within it!  

Ordinary living beings couldn’t survive here. Only the most powerful cultivators or demonic beasts could endure.  

Han stared intently. The sight of this [Thunder Hell] reminded him of the memories from Shangxi Zhenren’s thunder techniques.  

Before him now was a blinding expanse of lightning!  

Countless bolts of thunder mana intertwined, ceaselessly streaking from the sky to the earth. These countless interwoven bolts were like a prison of thunder, trapping and annihilating everything within!  

Over the past year, Han had endured hundreds of lightning strikes—he was no stranger to the experience.  

But if he were to step into this [Thunder Hell], he would likely suffer hundreds of strikes in a single session of cultivation.  

He didn’t rush in recklessly. Instead, he silently observed, waiting for the right opportunity.  

As time passed, the [Thunder Hell] underwent several surges of mana, and its peak intensity had already passed. The raging thunder mana gradually weakened.  

Sensing the timing was right, Han seized the moment and plunged into the heart of the [Thunder Hell]!  

With the [Thunder Summoning] hand seal, he began drawing upon the mana of the [Thunder Hell].  

Instantly, multiple bolts of thunder struck his body!  

He was instantly overwhelmed—utterly and completely.  

The successive thunder strikes once again exceeded his limits.  

Vast amounts of thunder mana surged into Han’s body, making him feel as if he were about to burst. He desperately pushed his limits, struggling to control the thunder mana within him.  

Yet, a significant portion of the mana still ran wild, coursing through his flesh and destroying his bodily tissues.  

If things had remained as they were, Han might have barely endured.  

But soon, another wave of thunder struck, and Han could hold on no longer!  

Without hesitation, he activated [Golden Light Flight] and fled beyond the range of the [Thunder Hell]!  

In an instant, he appeared a thousand miles away, landing atop a metallic mountain peak. Electric currents crackled across his body, discharging into the mountain beneath him.  

His skin was cracked and dry, as if scorched by flames.  

However, compared to his previous mummified state, this was much milder. His combat ability remained largely intact.  

Han had plenty of experience treating such injuries. At most, five days would be enough for a full recovery.  

Moreover, cultivating the [Body-Nourishing Soul Thunder Technique] within the [Thunder Hell] was far more efficient. Just this brief exposure had allowed him to refine twenty-seven thunder runes—far more effective than summoning his own thunderclouds!  

Han’s mana accumulation was accelerating!  

He remained where he was, fully activating his [Healing Dew] ability to mend his injuries.  

Soon, he would be ready for another round of cultivation. All he wished for was faster progress.  

If he could endure an entire [Thunder Hell], his comprehension and control of thunder mana would reach a whole new level.  

But just beyond Han’s sight, an unexpected event unfolded!  

Above Golden Blade Gorge, near the central section of Sky-Reaching River, within a [Metal-Devouring Hive] numbered thirteen by Wubing, a tiny crystal ladybug was in a state of utter frustration.  

This hive was the one she had painstakingly located after exhausting all her [Tracker Bugs].  

She had infiltrated it, scoured every corner, yet found not a single trace of [Metal-Devouring Honey].  

She, a true disciple of the top-tier Five Bamboo Sect, a seed of immortality!  

She had crossed two continents from the southern Bamboo Continent, all for the sake of obtaining a [Poison Immunity] divine ability.  

Yet, to her dismay, the sect’s supposedly reliable records had proven utterly flawed!  

The [Metal-Devouring Hive] she had worked so hard to find produced not a drop of honey.  

Such a colossal failure had severely impacted her path of cultivation!  

The crystal ladybug stared blankly at the [Metal-Devouring Queen] feasting on metal below, lost in thought.  

She had invested immense time and effort into this journey.  

If she failed to achieve her goal, she would fall far behind in her second-stage cultivation!  

Recalling the hardships of traversing hundreds of thousands of miles and the frustration of gaining nothing despite her sacrifices, she felt an uncontrollable rage burning within her!  

The crystal ladybug couldn’t help but direct her fury at the [Metal-Devouring Queen] beneath her.  

As a cultivator, she had no intention of suppressing her emotions. If her thoughts were unsettled, she would fight until they were!  

In an instant, immense mana erupted from her tiny form.  

The single ladybug began multiplying endlessly!  

Like a downpour, countless tiny ladybugs rained down upon the [Metal-Devouring Queen].  

The moment they landed on its body, they began tearing into it with terrifying ferocity.  

These seemingly adorable insects unleashed a horrifying destructive power!  

Even the armor forged from countless metals by the second-stage [Metal-Devouring Queen] couldn’t withstand them—it was easily pierced!  

The sudden assault shocked the [Metal-Devouring Queen]!  

But the strength of a second-stage demonic beast was not to be underestimated. It swiftly gathered its mana and activated its innate divine ability—  

[Golden Wind]!  

A gale of Gengjin mana erupted from its body, sweeping across its form and instantly annihilating many of the crystal ladybugs!  

Yet, as their corpses fell, they dissolved into a strange mana.  

This mana swiftly recombined, reforming into new ladybugs that flew back up to continue devouring the [Metal-Devouring Queen]!
