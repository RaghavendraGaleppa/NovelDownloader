# Chapter 26: Mutual Benefit

"Attack its underside! Just like last time, even a low-grade magic tool can break through!"

Seeing Wang Chan change his mind, Madam Cheng secretly sighed in relief. She lifted her hips slightly and smiled at him: "Brother Wang, please act quickly. I'll surely repay you afterward."

Wang Chan hadn't considered any repayment from Madam Cheng—his only concern was the unfathomable Brother Chen. Without another word, he summoned a silver needle and shot it straight toward the Three-Eyed Crimson Hound's perineal acupoint.

At that moment, with a loud "bang," the hound let out a miserable howl. Using some unknown power, it actually self-destructed its lower body to break free from Madam Cheng's control and leaped into the air.

Meanwhile, Madam Cheng was sent flying backward. The peach blossom illusion around her flickered several times, developing cracks but not shattering completely. Fortunately, she had remembered the difference between humans and demons and held back—using only the peach blossom illusion to suppress the hound, unlike her previous encounter with Li Yuan where she had physically engaged as well. Otherwise...

Perhaps resenting Wang Chan's interference or for some other reason, the Three-Eyed Crimson Hound, despite having its reproductive organs destroyed by Madam Cheng, ignored her and instead lunged straight at Wang Chan.

The attack was too sudden for Wang Chan to react.

"Brother Wang, be careful!"

"Bang!"

The hound's pounce was fierce, but Wang Chan, shielded by the golden barrier of his Vajra Talisman, stood his ground and took the hit unscathed. The hound, however, was sent flying several zhang away. After tumbling to the ground, it realized the futility of continuing the fight and turned to flee toward the valley's exit.

"The Vajra Talisman truly lives up to its reputation as one of the five great defensive talismans. Attacks of the same level feel like light taps," Wang Chan mused, admiring the golden barrier. Seeing the hound about to escape, he snorted coldly.

Suddenly, the hound froze mid-leap. From its head, numerous thin black needle-like shadows shot out, coalescing into a single black needle in mid-air. After a brief hover, it flew back into Wang Chan's sleeve.

Then, with another "bang," the hound's head exploded into a bloody mist, leaving only a headless corpse to crash to the ground.

"Ah!" Madam Cheng shuddered at the sight, scrambling backward several zhang on her hands and feet to put distance between herself and Wang Chan. 

This Brother Wang appeared refined and elegant, but who would have guessed he was so ruthless and sinister... that damned black needle!

Madam Cheng quickly plastered on a coquettish smile. "Tsk tsk, I never imagined Brother Wang had such a formidable black needle hidden away... Just how many of these thick, black needles do you have, Brother Wang?"

Wang Chan ignored her, scanning the surroundings to ensure no one was approaching before turning to leave.

"That Field Inspector Tian is a heterodox cultivator with a formidable symbiotic partner—the Autumn Wind Cicada—specializing in scent tracking and detection," Madam Cheng quickly added. "I always repay my debts, so I must warn you: if you take that high-grade demon bone and leave without masking your aura, you'd better abandon it now. Otherwise, Brother Chen and Field Inspector Tian will catch up to you sooner or later."

At the mention of the Autumn Wind Cicada, Wang Chan halted abruptly. He turned sharply, fixing Madam Cheng with a cold stare. "Is that true?!"

Wang Chan was well aware of this cicada's reputation. Not only was it a mid-tier bloodline creature, but its scent-tracking and detection abilities were exceptionally potent.

"I have no reason to lie. You could verify this with a little investigation," Madam Cheng said seriously. "Moreover, it's not just the tiger-dragon's aura—even if you leave, the traces of your presence here won't escape their notice."

Wang Chan's brow furrowed deeply. 

The tiger-dragon's bone alone wasn't a concern, but his residual aura here... Without a means to purify it, the Autumn Wind Cicada would inevitably pick up his trail, leading to serious trouble.

"How amusing to see Brother Wang lost in thought," Madam Cheng teased flirtatiously. "I happen to have a way to cleanse the residual aura here and help you leave safely. Interested in a trade?"

"Speak!"

"The horn you obtained doesn't just contain the demon bone—there's also a dragon pearl inside," Madam Cheng revealed. "I want that pearl. In exchange, I can give you a mid-grade Sealing Talisman, a mid-grade Purification Talisman, and a mid-grade Concealment Talisman. How about it?"

The Sealing Talisman could seal the horn, the Purification Talisman could cleanse the residual aura to prevent tracking by the Autumn Wind Cicada, and the Concealment Talisman could mask his presence during his escape.

Wang Chan quickly grasped the utility of these talismans. They were rare mid-grade items—things he couldn't currently afford or acquire.

"Was this your goal all along? The dragon pearl, not the bone?" Wang Chan suddenly understood, recalling Madam Cheng's earlier actions. 

But how had she known about the pearl's presence in the horn? The bestiaries made no mention of it. Typically, first-tier demons rarely produced inner pearls—those were usually found in second-tier creatures. Moreover, dragon pearls contained the essence of the creature and were extraordinary treasures, though their grade depended on the demon's cultivation level. This tiger-dragon's pearl was only low-grade, far less valuable than the high-grade bone he sought.

"Deal."

Wang Chan immediately probed the horn with his spiritual sense. Near the base, about three inches up and close to the bone, he found a pitch-black, egg-sized pearl devoid of any spiritual fluctuations. 

That had to be the dragon pearl—so unremarkable that he'd overlooked it initially. Unfortunately, without a suitable tool, extracting it quickly with just his silver needle would be difficult.

Noticing his hesitation, Madam Cheng rose to her feet, disregarding her injuries, and produced a pink, scalpel-like dagger from her storage pouch. "This Flower-Cutting Dagger of mine is a mid-grade magic tool—exceptionally sharp. You may use it."

Wang Chan eyed the dagger with interest. 

Another mid-grade magic tool. This Madam Cheng was quite wealthy... Too bad she couldn't be killed.

Taking the dagger, Wang Chan effortlessly sliced off a section of the horn containing the pearl. He then held it out, watching Madam Cheng expectantly.

With a smile, she retrieved three mid-grade talismans of varying colors from her pouch and handed them over.

After verifying their authenticity, Wang Chan passed her the pearl. He expected her to use the Sealing Talisman on it, but instead, she eagerly cleansed the black pearl with a wave of pink spiritual energy and—without hesitation—tucked it between her legs.

"..."

Wang Chan was speechless. 

She had actually stored the tiger-dragon's pearl... there. Were all female demonic cultivators who practiced absorption techniques this brazen? And could hiding it there really evade detection?

"Giggle... I have my methods for long-term concealment," Madam Cheng laughed shamelessly at his expression. "What's wrong, Brother Wang? Want to learn? Pity you're a man... Though if you're willing to use your back door, I could—"

"Enough!" Wang Chan's face darkened.
