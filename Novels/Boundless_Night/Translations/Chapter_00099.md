# Chapter 99: Tumultuous Winds and Clouds

Deep in the night, Crimson Radiance City was shrouded in a haze.

In the quiet courtyard, Qin Ming gazed at the night sky. With his strength significantly increased, he no longer felt such apprehension about traveling to the Land Beyond the World, now possessing a calm confidence. He observed the changes within himself; while the enhancement of his strength and perception was secondary, the most significant change was the evolution of his Heavenly Radiance Energy, which had become notably different.

He tossed a piece of letter paper into the air, flicked his finger lightly, and it shattered into dozens of pieces, drifting down like withered leaves. Qin Ming walked closer. As the shredded paper approached his body, before even making contact, it was pushed away by an invisible force, or else it emitted crisp sounds and exploded into confetti. He hadn't consciously activated his Heavenly Radiance Energy; it had manifested automatically, directly blocking and swiftly counterattacking whenever an external object approached. Undoubtedly, Qin Ming's Heavenly Radiance Energy was now not only more powerful but also highly spirited.

Now, if anyone harbored ill intentions towards him, attempting to scatter special medicinal powder on him under the guise of approaching, it would certainly be impossible. Many days prior, he had been tampered with by an old acquaintance, leaving an unusual scent on him that allowed the Bat-Bird to track him relentlessly, making escape impossible.

"If this continues, the constant evolution of Heavenly Radiance Energy will eventually trigger a mysterious qualitative change, bringing me a pleasant surprise!" Qin Ming was filled with anticipation. He now harbored a certain ambition: by continuously integrating various energy techniques, his own could potentially surpass even the Heaven-Propping Energy or Tathagata Energy in the future, holding infinite possibilities. Clearly, the integration of these two extraordinary arts had played a huge role in the transformation of his Heavenly Radiance Energy.

The next moment, a fiery glow lit up the small courtyard in the night. Qin Ming activated his Blazing Fire Energy, and his body was instantly enveloped in a faint red aura. It was like a divine flame, manifesting within his flesh and blood, not harming his body but rather nourishing it, and simultaneously transforming into Heavenly Radiance Energy to protect himself. Qin Ming extended his hand, and a stack of letter paper turned to ash upon contact with him. He was testing his attainments; his Blazing Fire Energy was already evolving towards the realm of special abilities.

A metallic clang sounded. Qin Ming's body appeared to be covered in a faint layer of golden armor; this was Vajra Energy, which he manifested as an overbearing defensive art. Following this, his body became covered in threads like silk, golden silkworm threads interwoven into a fine net, protecting him completely, with even golden lines appearing in his dark hair. This was the marvel of the Silk Scroll Method: it could merge various Heavenly Radiance Energies into one, and even transform into specific energy techniques he had cultivated. Moreover, when the integrated Heavenly Radiance Energy circulated along the paths of the extraordinary arts he had practiced, these divine flames and golden threads seemed even stronger than the original Blazing Fire Energy and Golden Silkworm Energy!

Qin Ming was extremely pleased; these changes delighted him. No wonder an old senior on the silk scroll had once written a single character: "Merge!" And that person had even used this character to admonish future generations. In the evening, he fell into the deepest level of sleep, and his Heavenly Radiance Energy automatically manifested, completely covering him in the form of a Golden Thread Jade Armor.

As dawn approached, the fire springs of Crimson Radiance City gradually intensified, like the rising sun, illuminating the land with morning glow. Qin Ming awoke feeling exceptionally vigorous in spirit and energy, almost wanting to find a disciple from the Land Beyond the World and give them a good beating. "After a night's sleep, why do I feel like I've consumed a potent tonic?" he wondered, a little perplexed.

However, he wasted no time and immediately went to tell Meng Xinghai that he had consumed the Five-Colored Spirit Branch and fully integrated his Heavenly Radiance Energy. "That fast?" Meng Xinghai's expression froze. Fortunately, he had recently been "trained" by the young man before him; every time, things surpassed his expectations. If this had been their first meeting and he knew such a result, he would definitely have stood up in shock again. Because he had given Qin Ming two days to absorb the violent Heavenly Radiance Essence from the Five-Colored Spirit Branch, yet the boy completed it in a single night! What was innate talent? Meng Xinghai felt that the definition of that term needed to be redefined; this young man made him value him more and more.

He spoke, "The saber and arrows haven't been forged yet. Come, I'll take you to select a powerful bow, and you can also look at other weapons." Qin Ming followed him into the armory, not standing on ceremony. He directly picked up what he needed, a set of twelve short spears, which he strapped to his back. When Meng Xinghai saw him select a great bow that flowed with dark light, his facial muscles twitched slightly. That was a treasured bow requiring over six thousand catties of force to draw. Only now did he realize that Qin Ming's claim of being "a bit stronger" than other Anomalous Humans his age wasn't arrogance, but extreme modesty! Even young Anomalous Humans after five rebirths only approached five thousand catties of strength, still a step behind him.

Afterward, Qin Ming selected a bronze staff. It was actually cast from mixed gold, extraordinarily sturdy, and belonged to the category of heavy weapons. He tested the bronze staff in his hand; it could be used as a spear, or as a heavy hammer for smashing. When wielded with both hands, it could even be used as a saber for chopping. In this way, his mastery of the four arts—saber, spear, arrow, and hammer—could be fully demonstrated in the great battles of the Land Beyond the World. Of course, these weapons were merely external manifestations. Given Qin Ming's current strength, his inner Heavenly Radiance Energy remained the most powerful and had the greatest destructive potential.

Meng Xinghai said, "You don't need to choose armor; the golden protective armor forged by those from the Land Beyond the World is quite good." Now, everything was ready, only lacking departure. He felt it was time to urge those forging the saber and arrows.

Meng Xinghai asked, "Why did you go outside? What are you looking at?"

"It's going to thunder," Qin Ming said, looking at the sky. Then he dropped a pile of weapons, turned, and ran, increasing his speed to its limit.

Meng Xinghai was lost in thought. Was he... going to the Thunder-Fire Forging Palace again? He truly couldn't forget that place. "The scale of the lightning isn't very large, and it's mostly unlikely to strike. Besides, your strength has just increased; there's no need to be so hasty and eager to absorb Heavenly Radiance again."

Qin Ming replied, "I'm doing it to cultivate extraordinary arts!"

"How is that place suitable?" Meng Xinghai followed, feeling a bit uneasy, worried that if violent thunder-fire Heavenly Radiance descended, it might injure Qin Ming before their departure.

"Thunder-fire forging, naturally, is suitable for cultivating the Golden Silkworm Art," Qin Ming said.

***

*Crack!*

This time, Qin Ming received four bolts of thunder-fire Heavenly Radiance. His entire body turned black as he continuously performed his arts according to the cultivation route of the Blazing Fire Scripture. On his body's surface, a layer of fiery light seemed ready to burst forth entirely, forming a unique protective divine radiance. Immediately after, Qin Ming began circulating his Golden Silkworm Art, also with immense smoothness. He wasn't speaking idly; the so-called thunder-fire forging was indeed effective. However, he was using the Blazing Fire Art to promote the Golden Silkworm Art!

"This secret scripture Ning Siqi found for you is truly good," Meng Xinghai nodded. The complementary nature of these two extraordinary arts greatly aided Qin Ming's improvement. Qin Ming felt that his total Heavenly Radiance had increased once again. For those who undergo bodily mutation, the rebirth period is the fastest stage of strength growth; he didn't want to miss any opportunity. However, the maximum number of rebirths was nine. After crossing this major realm, the next domain would be somewhat difficult, and he would need to find other methods.

In the afternoon, Crimson Radiance City shone brightest. Qin Ming received his brand new Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber, which was far superior to the crudely forged one he and Old Man Liu had made. It was slightly shorter than an arm, with smooth lines and an elegant curve. The pristine white blade gleamed with a soft luster, inscribed with dragon patterns and phoenix seal script. From any angle, it looked like an outstanding work of art, full of aesthetic appeal. Meng Xinghai told him that he had carved the dragon patterns and phoenix seal script, which could enhance the blade's killing effect if he encountered inexplicable, unseen entities. Furthermore, this was a mother-son blade; the "sheath" was a thicker blade itself, eliminating the need for Qin Ming to apply mineral pigments to conceal it.

The arrowhead was a luminous blue, exceptionally sharp, engraved with many characters, and the arrow shaft was also forged from special material. Meng Xinghai informed him, "The rare metal I originally prepared for forging has, this time, been refined into essence and placed within the arrow shaft. This way, your Heavenly Radiance Energy can extend to the arrowhead." Qin Ming noticed a metal filament running through the center of the arrow shaft, leading to the arrowhead. It should be able to conduct Heavenly Radiance Energy, similar to the jade iron. In the stage where his Heavenly Radiance could not be externally released, only rare and precious metals could achieve this.

"Pack up; we should get going," Meng Xinghai decided the next day. Before their departure, he used esoteric sect methods to conceal Qin Ming's true appearance. This was a necessary protection for him; after all, the thousand-year aristocratic Cui family had declared that he was not permitted to enter their circles within the next few years. Qin Ming looked at himself in the mirror: sword-like brows and starry eyes. His appearance had completely changed, yet his image hadn't suffered; he could be described as spirited and vigorous, with a temperament leaning towards sharpness and intimidation. In the past, he only exuded this temperament during combat, but now it was his normal state, instantly marking him as a combative individual among the newly awakened.

"Uncle Meng, this is..." Qin Ming was at the City Lord's Manor's training grounds. When he first saw the flying mount, he thought it was a giant turtle with wings. Upon closer inspection, he realized that Meng Xinghai treated this mount exceptionally well, having adorned it with armor mixed with rare metals, its bird body thoroughly covered. This was a high-grade anomalous beast. Its normal feathers were light gold, and its own strength was formidable. Not only was it armored, but its golden bird head also wore a steel helmet mixed with secret gold.

"Traveling long distances through the night fog is extremely dangerous. Should anyone ambush the mount, the consequences would be unimaginable," Meng Xinghai admitted candidly. The armor on this bird was no inferior to his own set. This wasn't his own mount; it was borrowed from an old friend deep in the mountains. Meng Xinghai also changed his appearance, not wanting anyone to know he had left Crimson Radiance City.

"The destination isn't far, about four thousand *li* from us," he informed. It was once a vital stronghold for those from the Land Beyond the World, but a thousand years ago, it was covered and pierced by endless Heavenly Radiance, forcing its abandonment. Luofu City, its scale was far greater than Crimson Radiance City. Even through the thick night fog, one could see the magnificent and brilliant city on the ground, its radiance piercing the night sky. Luofu Mountain, although abandoned by those from the Land Beyond the World, its surrounding areas had not fallen into decay; on the contrary, they were incredibly prosperous. Guarding the ruins of a former immortal mountain from the Land Beyond the World, it was impossible for there to be a lack of high-grade fire springs.

"Recalling those years, the top experts of the Land Beyond the World wished to elevate Luofu Mountain's grade..." Meng Xinghai shook his head, saying no more. Clearly, the events of the past were of great significance, and what those from the Land Beyond the World intended to do was quite insane. "Luofu Mountain was already extraordinary, considered an immortal mountain from the Land Beyond the World, and they still wanted to elevate its grade..." Qin Ming could only marvel at the grand schemes of those individuals.

Luofu City had recently become incredibly popular; news of the competition among disciples from the Land Beyond the World had spread everywhere, attracting many cultivators who wished to witness certain events. The city gate tower stood like a small mountain, immensely grand, with towering walls stretching before them. Qin Ming and the others entered the city, feeling its brilliance and liveliness. The brightness here was no different from an era with a sun. On the wide streets within the city, many beast-drawn carriages could travel side-by-side without crowding, and people flowed in and out of the shops on both sides, business thriving. At this stage, most inns had virtually no rooms left, forcing many to rent private residences. Meng Xinghai had already arranged for two rooms to be booked in advance, both with small courtyards. In this giant city where every inch of land was as precious as gold, the cost was certainly considerable.

That day, Qin Ming met Li Qingyue. She was staying in the adjacent inn and came over in the evening to see him and Meng Xinghai. "Qin Ming, I'll have to trouble you this time." Li Qingyue's dark hair flowed like a waterfall, her figure as slender as an immortal willow. Dressed in white, without makeup, her face was exquisitely flawless. She was pure and elegant, and when she smiled, it was as if clouds parted and mist dispersed, her entire being radiating light.

Qin Ming chuckled, "You've helped me so much, there's no need to be polite with me. Your smile is so dazzling it's almost blinding me, truly brilliant."

Li Qingyue smiled and nodded, relieved that despite all he had been through, he hadn't fallen into despair and was still the same as before. "I'll take you for a stroll around the city, and we can grab a meal. I'll also tell you about some things to pay attention to during this trip to Luofu Mountain," Li Qingyue said, calling for Meng Xinghai to join them.

Meng Xinghai waved his hand, politely declining. "I'm old now; walking with you two would make me look even older. I'll go find my old friends instead."

Qin Ming and Li Qingyue left. Not long after, they began to see several familiar faces. Many disciples from the Land Beyond the World were also staying in the large inns nearby.

"What are you looking at? Oh, that's Wang Caiwei," Li Qingyue chuckled.

"No, I saw my 'dear younger brother' Cui Chongxuan. Why is he here too?" Qin Ming said.

Li Qingyue said, "He's probably here to help Cui Chonghe compete for that quasi-immortal item."
