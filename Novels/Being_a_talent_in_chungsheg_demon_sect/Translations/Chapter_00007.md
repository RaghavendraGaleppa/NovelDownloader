Chapter 7: Divine Firmament Sword Art

Days later.

Inside his cave dwelling, Lü Yang sat cross-legged on a prayer mat, his right hand forming a hand seal. A speck of spiritual light condensed at his fingertips, eventually transforming into a White Bone Flying Sword as thin as a cicada's wing. The sword was a pale green-white, and when it vibrated, it resonated with the sound of thunder.

"Go!"

Lü Yang flicked his finger, and the White Bone Flying Sword instantly transformed into a magnificent, several-zhang-long streak of light, soaring forth. The sword light whistled, like heavenly thunder rolling through the sky!

"What a sword art!"

Seeing this, Lü Yang's face immediately lit up with joy. He then changed his hand seal, and the White Bone Flying Sword instantly split into two in mid-air. The next second, Lü Yang's figure vanished from his spot, as if teleporting, appearing directly where one of the sword lights was located. As Lü Yang changed his sword seal, his figure seemed to transform into a bolt of lightning, moving freely between the two streaks of sword light.

After a long while, Lü Yang finally stopped his movements, his face filled with excitement.

"Good! What a truly excellent Divine Firmament Sword Art!"

This sword art was actually quite simple: once a practitioner mastered it, they could split off sword light and then instantly move to the location of the divided sword light. The higher one's magic power, the farther the moving distance. If the sect master of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion were to personally use it, they could even sit within the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion and instantly teleport ten thousand miles with a single sword, effortlessly taking an enemy's head while chatting and laughing. This was merely the initial stage of the sword art's variations.

It was said that further mastery could truly manifest the power of Divine Firmament lightning within the sword light, but unfortunately, that part of the cultivation method was beyond Lü Yang's reach. It wasn't that he couldn't extract it, but rather that Yun Miaocing herself didn't know it. This was normal, however; a complete *Divine Firmament Sword Art* would certainly not be available for a mere 1,000 contribution points. 10,000 points would be closer to its true value.

"Hmph, utterly foolish!"

A cold sneer came from behind him. Lü Yang turned his head, only to see the woman from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion looking at him with a face full of disgust, disdain, and contempt. After days of interaction, Lü Yang had gained a deeper understanding of her. The woman's name was Yun Miaocing, an inner disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, a student of True Lord Divine Firmament, and her main cultivation was the Divine Firmament Sword Art. She once possessed a cultivation of Qi Refining Stage, sixth layer.

Lü Yang looked at Yun Miaocing, curious. "Did I perform my sword art incorrectly?"

Yun Miaocing turned her head away upon hearing him. "Do you think I'd tell you? You demon, even if you steal my sword art, you're merely mimicking it clumsily!"

"Why bother?"

Lü Yang shook his head, walked up to Yun Miaocing, and looked at her helplessly. "Are you sure you don't intend to tell me? Or are you going to force me to use *that* again?"

"That..." Yun Miaocing stared intently at Lü Yang. "It's just that demonic art; do you think I'll yield?"

"Even though you say that... you've already yielded once, you know." Lü Yang pointed to the emblem on Yun Miaocing's chest and said, "You haven't forgotten, have you?"

"You're lying!" Looking at the mark on her body, Yun Miaocing tightly pursed her lips in humiliation. "That time, you merely took advantage of my vulnerability!" After speaking, she gripped the pendant around her neck. It was a finely crafted small white jade sword, a magic sword only disciples of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion could possess, serving the same purpose as Lü Yang's disciple token.

"I am a disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, sworn enemies with the demonic path! This will never change!"

"No matter how powerful your demonic art, the human heart will not be swayed by such evil practices."

"My loyalty to the Sword Pavilion is absolutely unwavering."

"I swear by my magic sword!"

As her words fell, Yun Miaocing gritted her silver teeth, her gaze fixed on Lü Yang, as resolute as a pure lotus deeply mired in mud yet unstained.

Another day passed.

Inside the cave dwelling, Lü Yang sat cross-legged on a prayer mat, in the "five hearts facing the sky" posture. After a long time, Lü Yang finally exhaled a heavy breath of turbid air.

"You've actually mastered the Divine Firmament Sword Art quite proficiently. There aren't any major problems. If there are problems, they lie in external items..." Yun Miaocing spoke weakly. Under Lü Yang's relentless questioning, she finally gave in. When Lü Yang questioned her again, she merely let out a cold snort, then obediently explained:

"Our Sword Pavilion disciples, as soon as they enter the Qi Refining stage, use a secret sect method to take metal essence and other external medicines to refine a Sword Pill. All sword techniques in the Sword Pavilion require the aid of a Sword Pill to exert their full power. The higher the quality of the Sword Pill, the greater the power of the sword technique."

After Yun Miaocing's explanation, Lü Yang finally understood. When he cultivated the Divine Firmament Sword Art now, he could only split out two streaks of sword light, and its effect was limited to instant movement. While his speed was fast, his attack power was insufficient. However, once enhanced by a Sword Pill, the number of sword lights Lü Yang could split would at least double. At the same time, he could merge with the Sword Pill, unleashing astonishing slashes while moving within the sword light. Fighting others with this would undoubtedly give him the complete upper hand. In a direct confrontation, Lü Yang would only need to control the Sword Pill and split sword lights around the opponent. If the opponent was surrounded by sword lights, it would be like falling into his trap. From then on, no matter what methods the opponent used, he could easily avoid them and then attack from another direction, making them exhausted trying to parry. After a few rounds of such maneuvering, the opponent would naturally expose a fatal flaw. At that point, he would unleash a full-power slash, and the opponent would basically be doomed.

"Therefore, our Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion disciples are the best at combat in Jiangnan!" As she spoke, Yun Miaocing's face immediately showed a hint of arrogance. "Demon, you..."

Lü Yang stood up. "So, it was the Sword Pill I was missing. I also know the refining method now... Mm, you're done. You can go rest."

Yun Miaocing: "???"

*He's lying, right? Is it over just like that? What about the torture?*

The next second, she snapped back to reality, subconsciously clutching the magic sword around her neck. "No, this is good... I am a disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion..."

"Time to earn some money."

Walking out of the cave dwelling, Lü Yang began to ponder his future. "I only have 50 contribution points now. After deducting 30 points for this month's cave dwelling rent, if I don't earn money soon, I'll have to move back to the Joyous Union Palace next month."

In the Initial Saint Sect, there were many ways to earn contribution points. These included, but were not limited to, salaries for various sect positions, selling personal items, rewards for completing bounties, and sect missions.

"But for a disciple like me, lacking connections, wealth, and power—there are no channels for sect positions, most of my personal items aren't worth much, and I don't have the ability to complete high-value bounties. My only option is to take on sect missions, doing odd jobs for the sect, just to scrape by..."

The more Lü Yang thought about it, the more annoyed he became.

*I'm cultivating immortality, and I still have to work?*
