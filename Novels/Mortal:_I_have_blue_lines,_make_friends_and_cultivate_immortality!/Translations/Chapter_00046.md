# Chapter 46: Three-Yang Physique! (1/3)

"This kid!" 

"Everyone else was so easy to deal with—giving out free talismans and top-grade magical tools. But when it comes to me, he starts making all sorts of demands!"

Though inwardly dissatisfied, Li Huayuan's face was plastered with a smile. "Young Lin, no problem! From now on, you're my friend, Li Huayuan! And about the extra payment—how many spirit stones do you want to help me with this?"

While he wasn't happy about being manipulated by a mere Qi Condensation junior like Lin Yun, Li Huayuan wasn't angry either. After all, this kid could already craft mid-grade talismans. Making friends with him wasn't a loss—he could always find an opportunity to buy some mid-grade talismans from Lin Yun later.

[Ding, Li Huayuan has sent you a friend request.]

[Ding, Li Huayuan has become your friend. You may draw two rewards from him.]

[Ding, drawing in progress...]

[Ding, congratulations, host, you have obtained Refined Iron x1.]

[Item Description: Refined iron tempered by Li Huayuan's Three-Yang True Fire, superior in quality compared to that refined by other Core Formation cultivators.]

[Ding, congratulations, host, you have obtained Physique: Three-Yang Physique.]

[Item Description: The Three-Yang Physique, a special constitution second only to Heavenly Spiritual Roots, capable of generating Three-Yang True Fire within the body.]

"Oh?" Lin Yun raised an eyebrow at the system notification. "I actually got Li Huayuan's Three-Yang Physique? This physique should have bonuses for cultivating fire-based techniques, right? This will be quite helpful to me."

To Li Huayuan, Lin Yun's expression looked like he was deep in thought.

"This kid isn't planning to take this chance to extort me, is he?" Li Huayuan grew slightly worried.

"I'll set this aside for now and study it after the Bloody Trial. Let's deal with the current matter first." Lin Yun's gaze swept over Li Huayuan.

Li Huayuan was notoriously stingy. In the original story, when he took Han Li as his disciple, he only gave him a top-grade magical tool—the Greenlight Blade. 

And who knew if that tool was even high-quality? After all, Han Li never used it. 

Either the author forgot about it, or the tool was just an ordinary top-grade magical tool—utterly useless—which was why Han Li never bothered with it.

Looking at Li Huayuan, Lin Yun knew that making this man part with his treasures would be harder than killing him. He recalled that besides Li Huayuan and Floating Cloudzi, another Core Formation elder from the Masked Moon Sect—Old Freak Qiong—would also participate in this bet, offering three Invisible Needle Talismans.

Thinking of this, Lin Yun nodded. He wanted those Invisible Needle Talismans.

"Elder Li, I don't want any spirit stones or magical tools from you. If I help you win this bet and the rewards exceed what Floating Cloudzi offers, then let me choose one of the extra prizes as my payment. How does that sound?" Lin Yun said.

"Ah?"

"Why is this kid making such a roundabout request?" Li Huayuan was stunned. Wasn't this essentially no request at all?

First, it was about "being friends." Then, he could pick one item from the winnings. 

But it was just a bet between him and Floating Cloudzi. None of the other Core Formation elders from other sects would join in—there would only be one prize!

"This kid is truly handsome and kind-hearted!" Li Huayuan thought gleefully.

Little did he know that once Lin Yun took the Invisible Needle Talisman, his heart would bleed. One item could count as "one," but "one" didn't necessarily mean just one item.

"Good lad! This old ancestor didn't misjudge you! I agree!" Li Huayuan said cheerfully.

"Young Lin, we'll first find a place to drop you off. Then I'll take the rest of the disciples ahead. If that old ghost Floating Cloudzi sees you in the group, he definitely won't agree to the bet. Once our wager is settled, I'll come back to pick you up." 

Li Huayuan laid out his plan, even changing how he addressed Lin Yun.

"Elder Li, you're really cunning!" Lin Yun said with disdain. "Aren't you afraid Floating Cloudzi will try to kill you on the spot?"

"Kill me? I bet that old Taoist will come running to make a bet with me the moment he sees you're not in the group."

"Hahaha—this is called strategy!" Li Huayuan crossed his arms and laughed triumphantly.

After his bout of laughter, he patted Lin Yun's shoulder. "Young Lin, the cultivation world isn't just about fighting and killing. Sometimes, this is just as important." 

He pointed at his square-shaped head.

"Wisdom! Understand?"

"Hahaha—"

"This guy's really getting carried away," Lin Yun thought, exasperated. Then, with a smirk, he asked, "Elder Li, what if I don't gather any spirit herbs and you lose the bet? You wouldn't blame me, would you?"

Li Huayuan's triumphant expression froze, as if he had just swallowed something vile.

Lin Yun's meaning was clear: Keep acting smug, and I might just bring back nothing.

"Young Lin, please don't mess this up."

"My reputation is in your hands."

Days later, at a desolate mountain on the border between Yue Country and Yuanwu Country, dozens of yellow-robed figures of varying heights stood with their robes fluttering in the wind. 

These were the Huang Maple Valley disciples participating in the Bloody Trial. Following Li Huayuan's plan, Lin Yun was not among them—he had been dropped off earlier.

At the front of the group stood an imposing elder with an air of authority, his hands clasped behind his back as he gazed serenely at the sky.

Though he appeared calm, inwardly, he was growing increasingly anxious.

"Why isn't that old Taoist here yet?!"

"Did the Clear Void Sect send someone else this time?"

"I even swallowed my pride in front of Lin Yun! If Floating Cloudzi isn't coming, I'll have lost big time!"

"Old Taoist—hurry up!" Li Huayuan screamed internally.

"Old Taoist—"

"Old Taoist—"

"Old Taoist—"

"My world has no happiness without you!"

"How can I live without you?!"

"Old Taoist—"

Li Huayuan stood motionless, like a stone statue waiting for its lover, his divine sense locked onto the direction from which the Clear Void Sect would arrive. Even a passing bird couldn't escape his detection.

Just as Li Huayuan was about to lose his patience, the Clear Void Sect's group finally appeared.

In the blue sky, starlike glimmers gradually grew larger, soon revealing a series of black dots. Beneath them, silver light flickered—it seemed they were riding these starlights from beyond the heavens.

"Snow Rainbow Silk! They're finally here!" Li Huayuan recognized the Clear Void Sect's flying treasure. His divine sense swept over the robed figure at the front, and his tense mood finally relaxed.

It's really you!

Floating Cloudzi!

To maintain his indifferent facade, Li Huayuan put on a stern expression. Meanwhile, the Clear Void Sect's leader, the Taoist priest, scanned the Huang Maple Valley group and smiled in relief.

He had worried for nothing—a talisman-making genius like that wouldn't participate in something like the Bloody Trial.

"Another piece of refined iron for me."

---

"Fancy meeting you here again, Fellow Daoist Li. This humble priest, Floating Cloudzi, greets you!" Floating Cloudzi stepped forward with a beaming smile, speaking as if to an old acquaintance.

"Hmph! If you can come, why can't I?" Li Huayuan retorted, arms crossed.

Outwardly expressionless, Li Huayuan was inwardly ecstatic. "Falling right into my trap, you old fox!"

"Today, I'll show you what a real surprise is!"
