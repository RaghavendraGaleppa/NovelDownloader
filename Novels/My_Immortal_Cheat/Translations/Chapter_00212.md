Chapter 212: Gathering of Heavenly Forces

The people from Abyssal Tomb wore extremely grim expressions, secretly forming hand seals and directing them towards an unknown location.

Initially, the coffin was silent. But after only a moment, a terrifying pulsation emerged, threatening to suffocate everyone. Then, with a resounding *thump*, like a heavenly drum being beaten, it shook everyone, causing their blood and qi to surge, their ears to buzz, and their vision to darken. Following that, a rhythmic *thump-thump* slowly began, gradual but steady, becoming a continuous succession of beats.

It sounded like... a heartbeat!

The terrifying *thump-thump* grew increasingly dull and powerful, as if someone was reawakening from an ancient slumber, gradually regaining vitality. However, this was incredibly frightening. At a speed visible to the naked eye, black cracks appeared one after another in the void; space itself was collapsing!

"What level of being is this? Can the Star Realm not even contain them?" someone gasped, unable to believe what they were witnessing.

The creature in the coffin was awakening, its bodily functions improving and recovering, transforming towards a normal state. This process was so immense that it caused dense fissures to appear in the void. Afterward, breathing sounds resonated from the coffin, echoing through the void like morning bells and evening drums. With every inhale and exhale, unimaginable spatial storms raged.

Finally, ten thousand stars in the void simultaneously lit up, and faint sounds of surging waves could be heard. Everyone held their breath, concentrating, as an unimaginable existence was about to emerge from the sarcophagus.

"I... have finally returned!" A long sigh emanated from the sarcophagus. At this moment, the hearts of all living beings in this region pounded, and they couldn't help but tremble from head to toe. Even the strong felt their scalps tingle, sensing a chill of dread. They felt as if, in the boundless expanse of heaven and earth, an supreme being was looking down upon them.

*Smack!*

A crisp sound echoed between heaven and earth. Everyone looked west in disbelief. The chaotic light surrounding the Abyssal Tomb being who had made a move dispersed, revealing a perfectly clear five-fingered palm print on their face. He had actually been slapped. He himself was somewhat incredulous, his body trembling. Dao patterns emerged, and the nearby void began to crack. He tried to re-gather the chaotic light, but although it enveloped him, it conspicuously left the area of the palm print exposed.

"Heh..." Someone couldn't help but let out a snicker, only to instantly shatter and be annihilated the next moment. The rest fell silent, as quiet as cicadas in winter, daring not to utter a sound.

"Hahahaha." Suddenly, a louder burst of laughter rang out, drawing everyone's attention. Everyone shifted their gaze, only to find it was the young man standing beside the Lord of the Yellow Prison. Zhou Tian stopped laughing, scratching his head shyly. "My apologies, I couldn't hold it in."

The Abyssal Tomb being's aura surged, wanting to strike, but couldn't, because a figure had already appeared before Zhou Tian. "If you want to laugh, then laugh. Why hide it?" The one who appeared before Zhou Tian was precisely the being who had fully awakened from the coffin. There wasn't much difference between him and the figure formed by the human skin, except his aura was far more profound.

Zhou Tian opened his mouth, and said helplessly, "I can't laugh anymore now."

Everyone was speechless.

The Border Prison Grand Figure looked at the Abyssal Tomb being and spoke calmly. "Do you know who I am now? I am someone you cannot afford to provoke!"

The Border Prison Grand Figure casually swung his fist, and the void vibrated. A fist-light emerged, dazzling like a blazing sun, causing the starry sky to tremble and nearly crack. At this moment, the bodies of the three Abyssal Tomb beings grew cold. They all narrowed their eyes, and terrifying cold lightning burst forth from their pupils, tearing through the void! Ten thousand runes appeared in the starry sky, forming an array, attempting to resist. But it was swept away like withered leaves, shattered with overwhelming force. Their hearts were almost despairing, unable to understand why the gap was so immense.

At this moment, towering blood qi emerged in the starry sky. Within the blood qi, an immensely powerful figure appeared, blurry and indistinct, like a battle demon that had crossed realms, exuding immeasurable majesty. With a wave of his hand, a galaxy descended, enveloping half the starfield, with planets floating within it. The dazzling fist-light collided with the galaxy, tearing through the light barrier and surging into the outer reaches. Everyone could see the towering beams of light; the starry sky dimmed, and massive stars were extinguished.

"Friend, why bother with children?" It was a middle-aged man with thick, dense hair and a pair of silver pupils that seemed to ignite the ancient void, capable of seeing through all illusions. Most terrifying of all, four layers of star-screens surrounded his body: one as black as ink, one as crimson as blood, one eerie and gray, and the fourth as white as holy light. These four star-screens were not sacred at all; instead, they were profoundly demonic and sinister, carrying boundless malevolent energy.

The three Heavenly Venerates were called children, leaving everyone speechless. Yet, the three Abyssal Tomb beings not only showed no anger but instead wore expressions of shame. "Ancestor Li, I..." The Heavenly Venerate who had initially attacked tried to say something but was interrupted by the middle-aged man.

"No need to say anything. Although you were a bit impulsive, there is no one our Abyssal Tomb cannot afford to provoke."

"Oh! You want to try?" the Border Prison Grand Figure asked with a slight smile.

Suddenly, the crisp, melodious sound of wind chimes rang out. A golden carriage slowly drove in, steered by servants, entering this vast battlefield. They were several golden lion-beasts, reputed to be capable of contending with dragons. There were actually four of them, pulling the carriage together, approaching the location. Everyone instinctively made way, clearing a path for it.

"Beings from the Eastern Heaven have actually emerged and set foot here!" someone whispered in shock, recognizing the symbol on the golden battle chariot. Within the golden battle chariot sat a being with a gleaming golden face, an enigmatic symbol on their forehead, and exceptionally radiant hair.

"Fellow Daoists, please calm your tempers." As he spoke, the heavens resonated in unison, as if chanting, and various phenomena appeared.

In the starry sky, crimson mist surged, and phoenixes circled, their wings a brilliant, vibrant red, like sacred evening glow falling and dyeing half the sky. They were several exceptionally pure-blooded phoenixes, pulling a battle chariot, thundering across the heavens, and then slowly descending upon this place. Beside the chariot walked several armored warriors, all exuding towering vital energy.

People gasped, "The purest-blooded phoenixes pulling a carriage?"

"People from the Royal Court? What's going on today? Is this a gathering of all the great heavenly forces?" Someone trembled all over. The Royal Court was a force second only to the Border Prison, occupying the ancient spatial node number four, and now it too had appeared. From the phoenix chariot stepped a person with crimson hair and purple eyes, standing proudly.

"What, do you all wish to restart the Star Realm War?" He hailed from the Royal Court, the fourth strongest force in the Star Realm. This affiliation augmented him, casting a mysterious and awe-inspiring aura around him, incredibly imposing, making people feel a sense of oppressive power.

"Interesting, quite a complete gathering of people," the Border Prison Grand Figure murmured, his eyes infinitely deep. In his right hand, the Book of Burials appeared, shimmering with a demonic, blood-red light.

However, it was not over yet. In the void, purple qi permeated the starry expanse.

"Moo!" The roar of an ox echoed in everyone's ears.

"Could it be...?" Someone couldn't help but shiver, seemingly having realized something.
