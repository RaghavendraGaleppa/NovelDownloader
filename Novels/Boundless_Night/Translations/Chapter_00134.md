# Chapter 134: Far Exceeding Expectations

The leading woman of the Yuqing lineage actually focused on a young man, scrutinizing him multiple times, which greatly surprised many and made them follow her gaze.

"He seems to be called Qin Ming, from Crimson Glow City," someone whispered.

Many were astonished. They were familiar with the world's great cities, and Crimson Glow City was certainly not a renowned one; it seemed rather remote.

Qin Ming smiled and nodded. Regardless of whether the other party would respond, his courtesy was sufficient.

The woman was radiant, her slight smile exceptionally brilliant. She also nodded in greeting towards him.

Those around them were surprised, whispering in discussion.

Were these two old acquaintances, or was the young man from a small place so extraordinary that he had caught the attention of the leading woman of the Yuqing lineage?

Her name was Lu Yuzhi, an Anomalous Human. Two years ago, she had defeated numerous masters, possessing terrifying strength, though her impact had been minimized by others.

"Is this Senior Sister very famous?"

"Yes, an astonishing Anomalous Human. It's said someone injured her friend and provoked her, after which she challenged her way through, severely injuring several seeded experts from the Outworld Lands and Esoteric Sects."

Only a few people present knew this, as her achievements had been intentionally concealed by the Thousand-Year Family Lu, who didn't want Lu Yuzhi to be too conspicuous.

Qin Ming was very surprised, not expecting to see her here.

He wasn't very familiar with Lu Yuzhi, having only met her a few times. He had heard she possessed "Divine Insight" and assumed she would join an Esoteric Sect. He never expected her to become a disciple of the Yuqing lineage.

However, Qin Ming quickly understood.

Qingtian, Six Royal, Yuqing, and others each possessed the legendary Heavenly Radiance Force. On the path of the newly emerging cultivators, they were among the few Daoist orthodoxies that made the Outworld Lands and Esoteric Sects wary.

Although disciples of these ancestral courts would eventually face problems like slow cultivation and dismal later stages, requiring time to endure, they were indeed formidable in the early stages.

Qin Ming guessed that Lu Yuzhi intended to use Yuqing Force as her Dao-protecting method, while also pursuing the Esoteric Sect's path to godhood.

Her Divine Insight was abundant, making it easy for her to enter those Esoteric Sects.

The Yuqing lineage's selection of disciples was extremely strict; without the aptitude of an Anomalous Human, it was difficult to obtain true inheritance. Since she met the conditions, she naturally didn't want to miss it.

Lu Yuzhi walked towards Cao Wuji. Dressed in luxurious brocade, with features as exquisite as a painting, she wore a faint smile, exuding confidence and charm, her demeanor exceptionally outstanding.

Cao Wuji had previously been surrounded, like stars circling the moon, the absolute center of attention. But now, seeing this glowing woman, he immediately stepped forward to greet her, humble and modest.

Because he knew who she was, his own identity as an Anomalous Human was no longer exceptional in her presence.

"Do you want to join the Yuqing lineage?" Lu Yuzhi asked with a smile.

She hailed from a Thousand-Year Family and was a highly accomplished Yuqing disciple, also cultivating the path of Esoteric Sects. Though her smile was gentle, she possessed a considerable aura.

Facing her, Cao Wuji had no advantage whatsoever. Thus, he immediately addressed her as Senior Sister and expressed his willingness to enter Yuqing.

He was a decisive person, agreeing without any hesitation, quite straightforwardly.

Around them, people from Chunyang Palace, Wenxin Academy, and Five Elements Palace could only stare helplessly. Even if they desperately wanted to recruit this Anomalous Human, could they contend with the Yuqing lineage?

And they themselves were certainly no match for that woman; even if they teamed up, they would likely be crushed.

After a brief silence, many went to congratulate Cao Wuji.

Lu Yuzhi's expression softened as she informed him, "I must explain first, after you go to Yuqing, you will still need to pass some trials."

Cao Wuji nodded in understanding. How could learning the legendary Heavenly Radiance Force be so easy? Even an Anomalous Human had to undergo scrutiny!

The atmosphere in the purple bamboo forest grew lively.

Many gathered around the two Anomalous Humans. Some congratulated Cao Wuji, others hoped to join the Yuqing lineage, eager to learn about the qualification requirements.

Cao Wuji was very handsome and quite talkative, which made several young disciples of the Yuqing lineage present develop a good impression of him.

Lu Yuzhi, dazzlingly beautiful, nodded with a smile, also having a good impression of him.

Some people around them pondered. The Yuqing lineage actively coming down the mountain to recruit disciples was an extremely rare event.

A few realized that the Great Revelation Era might truly not be far off. Even ancient Daoist orthodoxies like Yuqing were beginning to expand and actively recruit top disciples.

Lu Yuzhi walked towards Qin Ming, immediately drawing people's attention again.

"It's quite unexpected, I didn't think I'd see you here." A spring breeze rustled, making Lu Yuzhi's robes flutter.

Her figure was tall and slender, her hair slightly lifted, radiant and dazzling. She was not only a noble lady from an esteemed family but also a Yuqing disciple, cultivating two paths simultaneously. She looked even more brilliant and splendid than before.

"Miss Lu, long time no see. Your grace surpasses the past," Qin Ming said.

The purple bamboos swayed gently with the wind, emitting a faint jade light. The scenery here was excellent.

Lu Yuzhi, with eyebrows like distant mountains, asked with a smile, "Did you come here because you want to join a certain Daoist school?"

Qin Ming nodded. "Yes, I'm tirelessly striving for my future, specially traveling from a remote place to Jinrui City."

Lu Yuzhi said, "If you wish to join the Yuqing lineage, you'll need to undergo various assessments. Do you want to sign up?"

Qin Ming was very interested in the Yuqing lineage and asked, "What are the conditions for joining, and how long does it take to learn the legendary Yuqing Force?"

Lu Yuzhi smiled. "Yuqing's assessments are very strict. The first step is to become a registered disciple, which requires a certain level of comprehension."

She chatted briefly with Qin Ming, informing him of some details, then walked towards her fellow disciples.

"Brother, do you know Miss Lu?" someone approached him. Earlier, he had tried to develop Qin Ming as a connection, but upon learning he was from a remote place, he immediately lost interest. Now, he was back.

"Senior Brother, are you very familiar with Miss Lu?" a purple-clad girl also appeared, greeting him with a smile.

Qin Ming was surrounded, but he was straightforward, telling them he had only met Lu Yuzhi a few times, and even if he wanted to join the Yuqing lineage, he would have to start from the registered disciple assessment.

A quarter of an hour later, the people around him dispersed, convinced that he truly came from the remote Crimson Glow City and was not very familiar with Lu Yuzhi, a core disciple of Yuqing.

After a brief exchange with some prodigies from the great cities, Lu Yuzhi spoke, "How about this, anyone who wants to sign up for Yuqing can test it out here."

She took out a stack of scripture papers and distributed them, saying, "They contain a type of Heavenly Radiance Force, temporarily created by our sect elders. Whoever can comprehend it and make it radiate four colors will pass."

Qin Ming also took a scripture paper. Since it was Heavenly Radiance Force, he naturally wanted to experience it.

It didn't take him long to cultivate it through, and he felt that it wasn't just four colors of Heavenly Radiance Force entwined; there should be more energies flowing.

Indeed, even more vibrant colorful glow emerged from his palm.

The eyes of those around him instantly changed. They counted carefully and found that it had reached eight colors, and he was still trying to make a misty glow surge!

"Little Qin, we should go." From a distance, Meng Xinghai appeared, calling for Qin Ming to leave.

"Alright!" Qin Ming nodded, the light in his palm extinguished, and he strode away.

In the purple bamboo forest, various exclamations erupted.

"I passed! I cultivated four colors!"

Subsequently, a few people managed to cultivate five colors, causing quite a commotion.

People turned their attention to Cao Wuji, and discovered that he had actually cultivated seven colors of radiance, immediately causing a sensation.

His palm seemed to have a rainbow flowing within it, with misty light steaming, sacred and auspicious, the brilliant glow exceptionally eye-catching.

"That's outrageous! He completed beyond the requirements!"

"Is this what an Anomalous Human is? The gap between us and him is so immense!"

For a time, exclamations of awe in the purple bamboo forest were incessant.

Many could only lament that people truly couldn't be compared. This visible gap in talent was genuinely irreparable; the difference was simply too vast.

Cao Wuji remained calm. What was this, really?

However, he pondered for a moment; the process of analysis was quite interesting.

"This has nothing to do with an Anomalous Human's physical endowment; this trial only tests comprehension. In fact, one can radiate one more color," Lu Yuzhi said with a smile. In her fair, jade-like palm, eight colors appeared, like a miniature immortal river flowing, extremely brilliant.

Cao Wuji was deeply surprised. One more color?

Lu Yuzhi was actually already very satisfied with him. She smiled and comforted him, "At your stage, being able to manifest seven colors is already very impressive. The eighth color requires a unique understanding of fused Heavenly Radiance. After all, you haven't learned that much yet..."

"I just saw someone who also seemed to emit eight colors..." someone whispered.

"What are you saying?" people nearby questioned.

In this area, others also looked over.

"What's wrong?" Lu Yuzhi asked.

The purple-clad girl was a little nervous, but she still spoke frankly, "I just saw someone emit eight colors!"

"Impossible!"

"How could our understanding of Heavenly Radiance reach that level at this stage?"

"Who is it? Where is he?"

A group of people didn't believe it.

Cao Wuji frowned and looked over.

A young prodigy from a great city spoke, "I think I saw it too. Eight colors appeared in his palm. It was that Qin Ming from the remote place; he was called away."

Immediately, there was an uproar. Someone had actually surpassed the Anomalous Human Cao Wuji! Leaving aside innate roots and the like, was his comprehension truly that amazing?

Cao Wuji was stunned. Was there someone in the same age group who performed better than him?

"This has nothing to do with an Anomalous Human's innate roots," someone tried to console him, trying to flatter him, but found that it had backfired instead.

Cao Wuji's expression was blank, but waves surged in his heart. In terms of comprehension, someone was actually more formidable than him!

Lu Yuzhi also showed surprise, looking at the direction where the retreating figure outside the purple bamboo forest had disappeared. Did he actually possess such comprehension? It far exceeded her expectations.

***

The next day, Cui He received some news and couldn't help but frown.

"He went to Jinrui City and met people from Daoist orthodoxies like Yuqing and Chunyang? Is he preparing to join a major ancestral court?!"

"It seems so. Oh, and there was a small incident; his comprehension is quite astonishing..."

That same day, Cui He received another report: Qin Ming was very interested in the Six Royal Force, supposedly wanting to join that Daoist orthodoxy!

Upon learning this, Cui Shuning's face darkened. "He's an Anomalous Human, and his comprehension is so extraordinary. Isn't this going to snatch away Chongxuan's core disciple spot? He's doing it on purpose!"

Most crucially, an acquaintance had tipped them off: Qin Ming had already won nineteen consecutive matches, and only needed one more to directly enter Six Royal, to undergo the elder's assessment. If he passed, he would become a core disciple!

Suddenly, Cui He and Cui Shuning felt like the sky was falling. Had they been intercepted? Was there actually such a rule, allowing direct entry into the Six Royal mountain gate to meet an elder?

"Quickly stop him! He must not win the twentieth match!"

"Where is the young expert we found earlier? Get him to participate!"

"He has a considerable background; it's not easy to get him to appear!"

***

Meng Xinghai was leisurely. He refused invitations for combat, playing hard to get, saying he only had one match left and wasn't in a hurry.

Over the past two days, Lu Yuzhi discovered that some acquaintances were successively asking her about Qin Ming's comprehension. They were old friends, all from esteemed families.

"Hey, don't you know? The one the Cui family gave up on has extremely high aptitude and shows signs of rising."

"I heard there will be a very exciting match soon. Do you want to go watch? Yes, that's right, a mysterious young expert is going to block Qin Ming."

***

Four days later, everything was settled. All parties involved had approved, and a duel—not widely publicized but of interest to many—was arranged.

Meng Xinghai was very satisfied. Although he had long known he probably wouldn't get the *World-Dwelling Scripture*, he managed to negotiate for a partial scroll in addition to the *Wood Element Scripture*. This was enough.

The stakes this time not only included the *Wood Element Scripture* but also six pages of the *World-Dwelling Scripture*, far exceeding expectations!

Cui He was in a very bad mood. Afterwards, he felt he had been led by the nose by Meng Xinghai, completely following his rhythm.

Cui Shuning was also very unhappy because she already knew that a small number of acquaintances, all from esteemed families, would come to watch this secretly arranged duel.

Although this wouldn't be reported, the appearance of these familiar faces still made her feel very embarrassed. Were they here to watch their downfall?

Her expression was cold. Most hateful of all, Meng Xinghai and some people from the Li family were protecting Qin Ming. To this day, Fifth Master Cui was still "drinking" with Li Qingyun! How many days had it been?!

Two days later, some acquaintances appeared in Crimson Glow City.

When someone from the Li family arrived, Cui He and Cui Shuning immediately became furious.

The Wang family members appeared with expressionless faces, which left them somewhat helpless.

"What are you little brats doing here?" Cui He finally found someone he could deal with and slapped him.

Zheng Maorong was a little stunned, really wanting to hit back... He paused, but he truly couldn't win. He had just come to watch the match after hearing the news. Why was he inexplicably getting slapped?

"And you lot, you young rascals, not doing proper things, what's with all this excitement?!" Cui He fumed.

Slap, slap...

The group of young men were all furious!

"Lu Yuzhi is here too, why don't you dare touch her?" someone retorted defiantly.

Late at night, outside Crimson Glow City, a dense fog enveloped everything. The world seemed to have been drenched in ink, pitch black, with nothing visible.

Qin Ming stood still. Across from him, in the heavy night fog, a young man slowly walked out!
