Chapter 59: The Genius Li Mo's Method of Investing in Jiang Chulong

"You've come, and you've brought a gift," Li Mo said with a hint of surprise.

"It's just a small token of my appreciation, Li You," Murong Hai replied, handing over the gift with a smile. He was pleased that his grandson had gotten along with Li Mo.

Li Mo was, in his opinion, far superior to the disciples from the major sects in the Donghuang Domain.

"I have something else to ask of you," Li Mo said, his expression turning serious.

"Please, go ahead," Murong Hai replied, eager to oblige.

...

A short while later, Murong Hai led Li Mo to the training grounds within the family estate. Several family members were practicing their martial arts, and they stopped to pay their respects when they saw their patriarch arrive.

In the center of the training grounds stood a coral stone, about three people tall.

"This is a Whale's Breath Coral Stone, a rare find even in the Donghuang Domain," Murong Hai explained, pointing to the stone. "Its unique property is that it changes color in response to the force applied to it. After some special treatment, it can be used to test the strength of one's attack."

Li Mo's eyes lit up with interest as he reached out to touch the rough surface of the coral stone. "I've never used one of these before," he said.

Mù Róng Xiāo, who had been watching, couldn't resist the opportunity to show off. He clenched his fist and struck the coral stone with a loud thud. The stone turned white, covering about eighty percent of its surface.

"Xiao's strike is almost on par with a Qi and Blood Realm cultivator at the tenth pulse," Murong Hai said with a nod of approval.

Li Mo watched with interest, his mind whirling with thoughts about his own strength. He decided to test his limits and asked Murong Hai if he could try.

"Don't worry, you won't break it," Murong Hai reassured him with a chuckle.

Li Mo nodded and threw a simple punch, unleashing a sonic boom that echoed through the air. The coral stone didn't budge, but it turned white and then developed a layer of blue at the bottom.

The onlookers gasped in amazement, having never seen such raw power before.

"This must be due to the effects of the Phoenix Blood Pool and the additional main meridian in his body," Li Mo thought to himself.

When he added his Extreme Soldier Slaughter Body technique, the air around him seemed to vibrate with intense killing intent. The family members watching felt a chill run down their spines.

Li Mo struck the coral stone again, and this time, it was half-covered in blue.

The onlookers were stunned, unable to comprehend how Li Mo had achieved such a feat.

"Xiao," Murong Hai called out to his grandson after a long moment of stunned silence.

"Yes?" Mù Róng Xiāo replied, still in awe.

"Didn't you say that Li You's strongest skill is his swordsmanship?"

...

As night fell, Li Mo returned to his quarters, shaking off the dust from his clothes. He had learned enough about his strength for now.

He didn't continue testing his limits, satisfied with the knowledge he had gained.

As he lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. He was no longer an ordinary person; he was on par with the disciples from the major sects.

He remembered that Murong Hai had given him a gift and opened the wooden box on his bedside table. Inside, he found a Po Jie Dan pill with four markings, a piece of dark, fragrant wood, and a booklet.

The pill didn't interest him, but the piece of wood did. It seemed to have a nourishing effect on the soul.

"This must be a rare treasure," Li Mo thought, playing with the wood.

He then had an epiphany. He remembered that his senior brother, Xiao Qin, had an old man by his side, likely an Intent Soul.

The piece of wood could be used to nourish that Intent Soul, potentially strengthening his connection with Xiao Qin.

Li Mo's mind began to whirl with ideas. He had a World Seed, a mystical realm that allowed him to bring weaker individuals into it.

He could leave a mark on an object, allowing someone like Jiang Chulong to enter the World Seed, regardless of their physical location.

"I can be Jiang Chulong's 'personal old man'!" Li Mo exclaimed, a plan forming in his mind.

He chose an ancient-looking ring, infused it with the energy of his World Seed, and smiled, proud of his ingenuity.
