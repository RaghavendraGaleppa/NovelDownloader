# Chapter 402: Reshaping Complete

In the days that followed, the area outside Xu Yunfan's tiled cottage gradually grew lively.

Disciples from the Hundred Desires Peak, dressed in sheer gauze robes, would lean against peach trees fanning themselves, or recline against porch pillars playing with jade pendants, their gazes constantly drifting toward the tightly closed wooden door.

"Is Senior Brother Xu in? Junior Sister just acquired a pot of spiritual wine and特意 came to invite you to drink together."

"I heard that Junior Brother has a strong physique. I have a manual called *The Dragon and Tiger Interchange Technique* here. Why don't we study it together?"

"I always feel my qi channels are unobstructed during cultivation. I'd like to ask Junior Brother to take a look..."

"..."

The cloying scent of cosmetics mixed with the fragrance of the peach grove, lingering incessantly around the tiled cottage.

Some male disciples with feminine features would feign boldness and knock on the door, hiding extraction artifacts in their sleeves. Female cultivators' skirts would flutter as they deliberately shook the silver bells on their ankles.

Even in the dead of night, the window lattice would be gently scratched by fingernails, accompanied by faint, breathless panting.

Xu Yunfan remained indoors the entire time.

The silk handkerchiefs tied to the peach branches outside grew increasingly numerous, like a spider's web spun by a group of spiders, patiently waiting for their prey to emerge.

The disciples at the courtyard gate came and went.

Seeing that Xu Yunfan never responded, they could only leave in frustration.

Within the Hundred Desires Peak, you could fight each other secretly, but if the commotion grew too large and the house was damaged, it would be a serious crime.

The buildings on the Hundred Desires Peak were all arranged according to the preferences of the Hundred Flowers True Lord.

Until one day, a golden hairpin suddenly pierced through the window paper. The tip of the pin flashed with a cold blue light, but it was caught between two fingers three inches from his brow.

"Senior Brother Xu, I have discovered an opportunity. If handled properly, I might be able to step directly into the late stage of Qi Condensation. Won't you go take a look?"

"Opportunity?" Xu Yunfan sneered and crushed the poisoned hairpin. "I'm afraid it's a soul-guiding banner on the path to the Yellow Springs."

He couldn't be bothered to respond. He simply allowed the pure Yang energy within his body to slowly diffuse outward.

A late-stage Qi Condensation woman standing outside the door sensed it, and her expression immediately turned extremely ugly.

This seemingly pure Yang energy had become somewhat impure, a clear sign that his virginity had been taken.

She immediately abandoned all decorum, standing outside Xu Yunfan's door with hands on her hips, cursing, "Which little slut got ahead of me? If I catch her, I'll have her drawn and quartered..."

Xu Yunfan's mind stirred slightly. Having completely refined Hua Xiangrong's true essence, he couldn't help but feel a few thoughts arise.

But he quickly suppressed them.

The woman cursing at his gate was not of ordinary origin. Unlike Hua Xiangrong, a peripheral disciple at the bottom of the Demon Origin Sect, she was a direct disciple of the Hundred Flowers True Lord.

As a late-stage Qi Condensation disciple, although she was still treated as a disposable tool, she received some degree of重视. As long as her cultivation was proper, she might be able to produce another Foundation Establishment True Lord.

Although they cultivated the same method and path, it didn't mean the path could only accommodate one Foundation Establishment expert.

"It's a bit of a pity..."

If he were to extract, or rather, subdue and devour the woman at his door, it would make his true essence even thicker. Once the opportunity arose, he could rely on his Martial Dao Mystic Crystal to forge his Divine Martial Dao Foundation.

On this day, Xu Yunfan finally awoke from his meditative state.

Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes, golden light flowing within his pupils like molten gold. The aura around his body was even more condensed and profound than a year ago.

As he stretched his body, a continuous series of bone cracks erupted from within, like thousands of玄 iron pearls rolling and colliding in a copper furnace.

Every inch of his muscles and flesh shimmered with a dark golden luster. Beneath his skin, true essence could faintly be seen rushing through his meridians like mercury slurry.

When his spine, the great dragon, stretched out segment by segment, it actually stirred visible ripples in the air. The dust within a thirty-foot radius was shaken into suspension, and the entire house trembled three times under his influence.

"Haah!"

A mouthful of turbid breath was exhaled, actually etching a spiderweb of cracks into the stone wall.

Xu Yunfan lowered his head to examine his palms. He saw true essence, like a stream of赤 gold, flowing between his palm lines. With a gentle clench, several streams of distorted air, Gang Qi, shot out from between his fingers.

The most astonishing thing was the True Martial Millstone in his Dantian. It had now condensed as if cast from赤 gold. Every rotation it made caused the three hundred and sixty-five major acupoints throughout his body to resonate in unison.

The protective Gang Qi that originally needed to be deliberately activated now circulated as naturally as breathing, forming a thin-yet-impenetrable layer of true essence armor on the surface of his skin.

He suddenly bent his finger and flicked. A wisp of extremely condensed true essence shot out. A peach tree ten zhangs outside the window snapped in two with a sound.

The cross-section was as smooth as a mirror; the wood had been instantly vaporized, forming a layer of glassy crystals under high temperatures.

"The True Martial Demon Devouring Scripture... is almost at Minor Completion."

Xu Yunfan's lips curved into a slight smile, feeling every beat of his heart like a seismic tremor.

Now, walking the path of the True Martial Dao, his physical body alone was enough to withstand attacks from late-stage Qi Condensation artifacts. His true essence reserves were even more comparable to three times that of an ordinary late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator.

What excited him the most was that the *Hundred Meridians Penetrating幽术* had finally reached the Great Accomplishment realm.

Now, looking inward, he saw the three hundred and sixty-five main meridians like a brilliant galaxy, and the one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred minor meridians like a spider's web. Under the infusion of true essence, they all shimmered with a glassy luster.

Every acupoint had turned into a miniature vortex. Their inhalations and exhalations echoed with the True Martial Millstone in his Dantian, constituting a mysterious diagram of the周天星斗's operation.

The changes brought by the completion of his meridians far exceeded expectations. The speed of true essence flow increased more than tenfold. A cycle that originally required three revolutions could now be completed in an instant.

The most marvelous thing was the hidden minor气脉 within his muscle fibers. They allowed every inch of his flesh and blood to directly absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, completely breaking the shackles of traditional cultivation which must pass through the Dantian.

Xu Yunfan suddenly formed a sword with his fingers. A stream of true essence shot out from his fingertip.

Unlike the straight trajectories of the past, this true essence actually drew seven circuitous arcs in the air, simultaneously hitting seven falling peach blossoms.

This was precisely the wonder of the Hundred Meridians Penetrating幽术. It allowed true essence to switch and flow through any meridian as easily as moving an arm.

No wonder, no wonder there were the Hundred Meridians Penetrating幽术 and the Meridian Opening Pill.

I'm afraid many disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect would rely on this to reshape their internal meridians.

"It's done!"

Xu Yunfan let out a long breath. The knot of anxiety in his chest finally dissipated completely.

He felt the true essence surging within him. The three hundred and sixty-five major acupoints shone like stars, and the one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred minor meridians flowed like rivers.

This body, which had undergone countless trials and tribulations, had become the most perfect foundation for cultivation.

Although for others, it was acquired and difficult to compare with the先天 (innate), for Xu Yunfan with his mediocre aptitude, it was already excellent.

"The foundation of the Great Dao has been laid. Next, it will be a natural progression."

When the technique reaches Great Accomplishment, it will be time to condense the Martial Dao Mystic Crystal and forge the Divine Martial Dao Foundation.

Only then will he be truly able to jump out of the cage of "talented material" and stand firm within this law of the jungle, the Demon Origin Sect.
