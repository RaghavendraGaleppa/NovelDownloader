# Chapter 79: Dingbei City

A hoarse voice came from behind. Xu Yunfan turned to see a stooped old man walking slowly toward him, leaning on an iron cane.

The old man wore simple clothes, his exposed chest revealing extremely solid muscles. His face was covered in deep wrinkles, but his eyes still shone with a sharp light.

He had achieved the Great Completion phase of Muscle Sinew Training—a Second Step Martial Master.

Xu Yunfan cupped his fists slightly and said, "This one is Xu Yunfan. Passing through this area, I noticed the extraordinary aura of the Divine Weapon Ridge and decided to come take a look."

The old man's eyes flashed with a complex expression upon hearing this, then he gave a bitter smile.

"Extraordinary aura? Heh, the Divine Weapon Ridge of today is no longer what it was thirty years ago. That sword strike back then didn't just cleave the mountain ridge; it also broke our backs."

Hesitating for a moment, Xu Yunfan finally took out the Divine Weapon Token from his chest.

"I also know an elder of the Divine Weapon Ridge. He asked me to stop by if I happened to be passing through."

The old man quickly stepped forward, took the token, and looked at it. He suddenly understood. "So it's Lu Xiaozi. I didn't think he was still alive. Rare, truly rare..."

Before he finished speaking, he looked Xu Yunfan up and down and sighed. "If only you had come two years earlier, the Divine Weapon Ridge might have had a way to survive. But now..."

He naturally knew what Lu Yi meant by sending this token. Unfortunately, the lineage was now severed. Even as an elder of the Divine Weapon Ridge, he had only been an outer disciple back then. He returned the token to Xu Yunfan.

"Now that the tree has fallen, the monkeys have scattered. The roots are all gone. Coming here now would only hold you back."

Xu Yunfall silent for a moment before asking, "Elder, who exactly was that peerless Grandmaster who wielded the Divine Weapon back then?"

The old man shook his head.

"That person's origins are a mystery. All we know is he wielded a Divine Weapon called 'Heaven's Punishment.' One sword cleaved the mountain, and another sword took lives.

After those two swords, the lineage of the Divine Weapon Ridge was severed. The experts within the sect all perished, leaving only us old, weak, and disabled few to guard these few broken blast furnaces, barely managing to make a living."

Although the old man said this, Xu Yunfan could sense there was more to the story. He didn't press further; delving too deep into matters concerning a Grandmaster of Qi Refining would only bring disaster.

Xu Yunfan looked up at the few smoke-belching blast furnaces on the mountainside, faintly hearing the clanging of forging.

A thought struck him, and he asked, "Elder, can the Divine Weapon Ridge still forge weapons?"

The old man replied, "Forge weapons? Heh, the Divine Weapon Ridge of today can only forge common blades and swords, just enough to scrape by. True Divine Weapons turned to dust along with that sword strike long ago."

He glanced at the瓮金锤 (Weng Jin Hammer) on Xu Yunfan's back. The fine steel hammer was covered in signs of wear, with several clear sword and blade marks visible, some old, some new.

This was enough to show the journey here had not been peaceful.

The old man seemed to want to say more, but in the end, he just waved his hand. "The Divine Weapon Ridge has now become the Divine Weapon Valley. We take on some forging work to survive, just dragging on a miserable existence."

Xu Yunfan remained silent. After chatting for a while, he bid farewell and left.

As he drew closer to Wuzhou, the official road became increasingly desolate. More and more refugees in tattered clothes appeared in his sight. Many of the villages and towns he passed were reduced to rubble. From time to time, he could see rebel forces lurking in the distant shadows, eyeing him covetously.

When the fifth burnt-out village appeared before him, Xu Yunfan finally reined in his horse.

Under a broken wall lay the corpses of women and children, a child's palm still clutching half a millet cake.

Thirty paces away, a crooked boundary marker was stained with blood, the three large red characters "Wuzhou Territory" covered in filth. Swarms of green-headed flies buzzed as they landed and took off.

*Swish!*

A whistling sound came from the left.

Without turning his head, Xu Yunfan reached back and grabbed the incoming arrow.

The arrow shaft was wrapped in rancid corpse oil, and the iron arrowhead was covered in red rust. This was a poison arrow. If an ordinary person were even slightly scratched by it, without medicine, their skin would fester and they would die.

"A fat sheep!"

Five figures darted out from the withered forest.

The leader, a man with a scarred face, brandished a chipped woodcutter's knife. The other four held sharpened wooden spears. The sunken-eyed refugees actually pushed a pregnant woman forward as a shield.

The woman's belly was swollen like a drum, but a hemp rope was looped around her neck, pulling her forward stumblingly.

The bandits' eyes were bloodshot with greed as they looked at Xu Yunfan's large horse and the bundle on it, completely oblivious to the Weng Jin Hammer already in Xu Yunfan's hand.

These bandits could no longer be called humans. They only knew how to rob and kill, like walking corpses.

Bloodshot appeared in Xu Yunfan's eyes.

"Red eyes, sparse teeth."

The Weng Jin Hammer slammed into the ground, the shockwave sending leaves flying within a radius of five zhang.

"Cannibalistic countenance."

The scarred face man suddenly froze.

He saw the black-clothed martial artist's muscles begin to bulge like diamonds, and a scorching aura swept over him, finally dispelling the greed in his eyes. He saw the long-handled heavy hammer in Xu Yunfan's hand, which seemed as light as a feather.

This was a martial artist!

Just as he tried to retreat, Xu Yunfan had already charged forward on his horse.

When the first hammer fell, a rain of blood mixed with bone fragments splattered.

Xu Yunfan wielded the hammer like a brush. The hammer fell like thunder, the butt of the handle挑筋 (hooking tendons) like a stroke of a pen. He spun and swept through a thousand enemies, not meeting a single match.

By the time he reined in his force, five headless corpses knelt as if in penance. The hemp rope around the pregnant woman's neck had already turned to dust.

"Thirty li north, Licheng in Qingzhou, there is a disaster relief tent."

He stuffed a water bag and dried rations into the woman's hand, his vambrace still沾着丝缕脑浆 (stained with threads of brain matter).

"If you can make it, you should be able to live."

When the numb-faced woman looked up, the man and horse were already far away, quickly disappearing from sight.

Night fell, and Xu Yunfan saw the walls of Dingbei City at the border of Wuzhou.

The moat had long since dried up, its bed piled with human and animal bones. The city gate plaque had already fallen to the ground, broken in two.

The arrow towers on the city wall had mostly collapsed, the gaps crudely blocked with wooden stakes. Under the guards' standard leather armor, patched coarse cloth clothes were visible—they were clearly civilians in disguise.

"Buns! Hot meat buns!"

A hoarse shout came from the base of the city wall. Xu Yunfan turned his head to look.

A one-eyed old woman guarded a steaming steamer, but there wasn't a single bun on the bamboo tray.

 three hungry people with green light in their eyes were lingering in front of the stall, then suddenly pounced on the steamer.

A cold light flashed from the old woman's sleeve, and a bone-chopping knife was already lodged in the throat of the leading hungry person.

*Crack!*

Xu Yunfan's fingers clenched with a cracking sound.

He saw clearly: inside the steamer crouched the corpse of a young child, the child missing its left leg, the wound sprinkled with coarse salt. It was a 'meat source.'

The old woman licked the blood foam on the knife, her single eye jumping with mad delight. "How many steamer baskets does the guest want? The meat of a newborn cub is the most tender."

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath, dismounted, and thrust the Weng Jin Hammer forward. In an instant, the entire section of the city wall trembled.

When the first rays of dawn pierced the clouds, a nine-foot-high tower of corpses stood before the gates of Dingbei City.

Xu Yunfan held the blood-dripping Weng Jin Hammer inverted, stepping through the filth of blood toward the half-broken city gate.

In the shadows of the barbican, dozens of greedy eyes lingered on him, but no one dared to cross the line.

These people were mostly survivors from when Dingbei City fell. To survive now, their actions were close to those of demons and monsters.

What met the eye was a scene of devastation everywhere.
