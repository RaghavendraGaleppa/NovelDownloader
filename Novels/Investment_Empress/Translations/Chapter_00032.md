## Chapter 32: Should True Experts Always Be Humble?

Elsewhere in the Stony Stream Forest.

Lin Jiang was covered in wounds, his long spear flailing defensively, already in decline. Entangled in battle with him were two massive, ring-patterned fierce wolves. Judging by their aura, one was at the early Ninth-Grade, the other at mid-Ninth-Grade. Red-ringed Wolves, in terms of strength, weren't considered powerful among Ninth-Grade exotic beasts, but they were incredibly cunning, never appearing alone and always cooperating with each other.

"If this drags on, it'll be disadvantageous for me." Lin Jiang's brow furrowed. Even if the trial ended here, he needed to decide the victor quickly. He was seriously injured now, and if more Red-ringed Wolves were attracted, he feared the worst. Among the True Disciples, Murong Xiao possessed a half-demon physique, and Ying Bing... there was no need to even mention her; even a genius would despair against her. Li Mo... he was said to have excellent social connections? In short, only he, Lin Jiang, was completely unknown. Having broken through to the Qi-Blood Realm's Six Meridians and mastered spear arts to the minor completion stage, he was capable of handling most mid-Ninth-Grade exotic beasts. He had intended to astonish everyone with a single brilliant feat, so stopping here felt truly unwilling.

"I'll risk it!" Lin Jiang had an ultimate technique he had planned to use against late Ninth-Grade exotic beasts. He surged his qi and blood, thrusting his spear forward with a speed that tore through the air. The slightly stronger Red-ringed Wolf was pierced through by a single strike.

However... "Awoo!" The early Ninth-Grade wolf, instead of avenging its companion, let out a howl. "Damn it, it's calling the pack!" Lin Jiang's expression instantly changed. But he had just used his killing move, and his strength was temporarily depleted, leaving him no time to stop it.

The next moment, something strange happened. "Awoo... wuwuwu..." The howl meant to summon the pack, in the very next instant, turned into a whimper. A figure emerged from the stone forest, dragging a Red-ringed Wolf.

"You're a True Disciple, right? Your name is... Lin Jiang?" A voice, seemingly smiling yet carrying a certain oppressive weight, spoke.

"Hmm?" "Wang Hu?" Lin Jiang recognized the newcomer. It might sound rude, but during Wang Hu's initiation ceremony, he had tumbled down the Sky-Ascending Stone Steps like a rolling gourd, falling all the way from the Inner Sect to the Outer Sect. This incident was widely known within the sect, making it hard not to recognize him. Now, it seemed the other party's true strength wasn't much weaker than his own.

"Many thanks, Brother Wang." Lin Jiang let out a breath.

"Heh heh, what you killed is yours, what I caught is mine. Any objections?" Wang Hu twisted the Red-ringed Wolf's neck with a snap.

"Naturally." Lin Jiang breathed a sigh of relief. It was already good enough if this mid-Ninth-Grade wolf counted as his spoils of war.

Gulp, gulp, gulp – Just as Lin Jiang finished firing his signal flare, a sound of vigorous drinking reached his ears. He turned his head, his brow furrowing even deeper than before. He saw Wang Hu biting into the Red-ringed Wolf's neck, taking large gulps of the foul-smelling wolf blood, a look of enjoyment on his face. Lin Jiang felt a chill of disgust in his heart.

"Two Red-ringed Wolves." "One for Lin Jiang, one for Wang Hu." The nearest deacon arrived, quickly inspected them, then carried the two wolf corpses away. The deacon's figure receded into the distance.

"I shall take my leave." Lin Jiang cupped his hands, also intending to depart. Wang Hu gave him an uncomfortable feeling, and after witnessing that scene, he truly wished to avoid further contact. He had only taken two steps.

"Who said you could leave?" A rustling sound suddenly came from behind him. Lin Jiang's steps halted. When he turned back, his pupils violently contracted. He saw Wang Hu's arms expanding at a bizarre speed, rapidly sprouting mottled fur. The gaze he turned on Lin Jiang had almost lost all human emotion, leaving only the bloodthirsty ferocity of a wild beast.

Just now, Wang Hu had deliberately led the nearest deacon away?

"You!" Whoosh – Lin Jiang didn't even have time to speak before a fierce gust of wind slammed into his face.

At the same time, not far away.

"What's that commotion ahead?" Li Mo, bare-chested, moved through the stone forest. Don't misunderstand; student Li had no peculiar habits. He primarily cherished the clothes his mother had hand-stitched for him, and knowing they wouldn't survive a fight anyway, he simply stored them in his system space. Hearing the intense sounds of battle ahead, he quickened his pace.

Then, upon arriving, he saw two figures clashing. Lin Jiang was clearly at a disadvantage, being forced into a sorry state, blood flowing from various parts of his body. If this continued, he might not be killed by his opponent but would surely succumb to excessive blood loss.

"What exotic beast is Lin Jiang fighting?" "No, this isn't an exotic beast..." Li Mo sensed something was wrong. His Heavenly Fate Divine Eye swept over.

**[Name: Lin Jiang]**
**[Age: 16]**
**[Root Bone: Mantis Leg, Green Serpent Spine, Magpie Shoulder]**
**[Realm: Qi-Blood Realm, Six Meridians]**
**[Destiny: Blue-Black]**
**[Evaluation: This person's talent is decent, but he is overly eager for quick success and prone to breaking. If he can awaken in time, he may yet advance to a higher level.]**
**[Recent Encounter: After an intense battle and before he could recover, he encountered Wang Hu, whose sanity had been devoured by a Beast Seed. Though he will not die, he will be severely injured and disheartened.]**

"That's Wang Hu?" Li Mo's brow slightly raised. Taking a Beast Seed could turn someone into this monstrous state? Also, Wang Hu was clearly trying to kill him, yet the Heavenly Fate Divine Eye said Lin Jiang wouldn't die in the end... Was it the elders? Li Mo's heart was filled with understanding. It must be the elders, silently monitoring Wang Hu's movements. For some reason, they hadn't directly intervened, but they couldn't watch a True Disciple die in vain, so they would eventually save Lin Jiang.

"Whether the elders save him or not," Li Mo mused, "if I make a move, that's another blue investment."

"Wang Hu, we have no grudge between us!" "In-fighting among fellow disciples is a grave sin! Stop now, and I can pretend nothing happened." Lin Jiang's aura grew weaker and weaker. He knew he had no chance of winning and could only hope to make the other party hesitate by speaking.

"The Red-ringed Wolf also had no grudge against you." "It's the law of the jungle; if you're weaker than me, you become my blood meal. What sin is there in that?" Wang Hu licked a streak of blood from his tiger claw, his eyes growing even more ferocious. Lin Jiang gritted his teeth, knowing there was no possibility of negotiation between them. Today, either he would die, or Wang Hu would!

A fierce gust of wind assailed him again. He could only force himself to gather all his strength, preparing to use his ultimate technique once more. But, due to excessive blood loss and extreme exhaustion, this spear strike was far less swift than the last. Halfway through the thrust, Wang Hu, with a sneer, actually flipped his palm and seized the spear shaft. Then, his already clawed hand slammed down with a crash. Not to mention a human head, even a bluestone slab would be shattered into pieces by that blow. Lin Jiang sighed inwardly. Was his life truly going to end here?

Bang! A loud crash.

"Huh?" Lin Jiang was astonished to find that his head had not been smashed as he expected. Instead, Wang Hu staggered back several steps, each step leaving a deep crater in the ground. A lean, panther-like young man, bare-chested, had appeared before him at some unknown point.

"True Disciple Li?" Lin Jiang was stunned.

"Li Mo, you're still as meddlesome as ever!" "Good, you came at just the right time, I was just looking for you!" Wang Hu completely lost his earlier pretense of calmness. From the moment he saw Li Mo, he became even more like a mad beast. Some people, merely by appearing, could make him lose his composure.

"Don't make a fuss, just stand still." "Wait for the Inner Sect deacon to arrive and await the sect's judgment." Li Mo's brow subtly furrowed. Saving Lin Jiang meant his investment was complete. He didn't know what the elders planned, and he was too lazy to do anything superfluous.

"You're courting death!" This attitude, to Wang Hu, meant Li Mo wasn't taking him seriously. So, he completely lost control. Not just his arms, but his entire body began to swell, thick fur sprouted, and a tiger tail lashed out like a steel whip. He no longer resembled a human in any way. He was practically a standing, striped ferocious tiger! With crimson eyes, he seemed intent on devouring Li Mo alive, pouncing forward fiercely!

"Brother Li, be careful!" Lin Jiang's heart turned cold, and he roared loudly. He could sense that Wang Hu's aura at this moment was even more terrifying than before. Even a peak Ninth-Grade exotic beast would be no more than this! He immediately pulled out a signal flare and fired it. Seeing Li Mo neither dodge nor evade, he anxiously spoke again: "Brother Li, run quickly, otherwise neither of us will get out—"

Bang – A dull thud. The massive tiger claw collided with Li Mo's fist. The contrast was immense. But the result almost made Lin Jiang's eyes pop out of his head. The furry tiger arm instantly burst into sprays of blood mist, snapping like it had no bones. Li Mo remained expressionless. He then grabbed Wang Hu's head and, with a flip of his palm, slammed him to the ground.

Boom – The ground shattered.

"Such a long wind-up, I thought you were going to do something big." "Cultivating evil arts is a move, not cultivating them is also a move. Why bother making yourself neither human nor ghost?" Li Mo said nonchalantly.

Wang Hu's eyes rolled back, and he lost consciousness. It was unclear if he was knocked out by the fall, or if he was so overwhelmed by grief and indignation from Li Mo's words that he fainted. Soon, the beastial transformation on Wang Hu's body vanished, and he reverted to human form. His aura instantly plummeted, like an old man's candle flickering in the wind.

Not far away, Lin Jiang's mouth hung wide open, large enough to swallow two eggs. Wang Hu, who was equivalent to a peak Ninth-Grade exotic beast, was instantly defeated? Truly in one move? To be honest, he even had a feeling that Li Mo hadn't used his full strength. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been just knocking him out; killing Wang Hu would have been effortless.

They had clearly entered the Qingyuan Sect together. Why was Li Mo so despairingly strong? Moreover, Lin Jiang had joined the sect with prior training, having studied for a long time at a martial arts academy before entering Qingyuan Sect. Whereas Li Mo, upon entry, hadn't even opened his meridians. He was a complete commoner with no strength to bind a chicken; back then, Lin Jiang could have easily beaten a hundred Li Mos. How much time had passed since then?

As Lin Jiang doubted his very existence, a wooden box was handed to him.

"Here, for external application." At the same time, a bright, clear voice spoke, "Hundred Flowers Dew Ointment, it has miraculous effects on external injuries."

"This..." Lin Jiang snapped back to reality, looking up at the sunny, smiling face. Without hesitation, he silently applied the medicine to his wounds.

At the same time.
**[Investment successful. Invested half a bottle of Hundred Flowers Dew Ointment.]**
**[Received feedback: One copy of the martial art Golden Bell Shield. Do you wish to claim it?]**

"No, I won't claim it." Replying to the system mentally, Li Mo waved his hand at Lin Jiang. "Alright, you wait here for the deacon." "I'm in a hurry, so I'll be leaving first." With that, he strode away, continuing towards Wangyue Cliff.

"Brother Li, take care!" Lin Jiang watched his retreating back, a sense of awe and admiration rising involuntarily in his heart. The wound medicine was remarkably effective; it stopped the bleeding immediately after he applied it. Not only had his life been saved, but he could even continue participating in the trial.

"Saving a life without expecting anything in return." "Should true experts always be humble, then...?" Lin Jiang pondered, deep in thought, and slowly stood up again.
