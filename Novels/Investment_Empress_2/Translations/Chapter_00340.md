# Chapter 340: Cultivation Attire? A Medical Miracle!

Three days later, at noon.

The sky, which had been overcast for a long time, finally saw the sun.

Sunlight shone through the window, illuminating a dancing haze of dust and the figure of Li Mo, who was lying comfortably on the bed.

"Why hasn't the Ice Cube brought food yet?"

Li Mo ate a snack and poured himself a cup of tea with a teapot.

He hadn't fully recovered yet, but he was far from the state where he couldn't even lift a shoulder or carry anything. The recovery speed of this immortal body was simply like riding a rocket.

In a few more days, he would be able to enter the Southern Frontier again with the senior demon beasts and complete his plan to show off his prowess in front of everyone!

*Tap—*

Li Mo's ears twitched. He instantly lay back on the bed, putting on a weak expression.

A moment later, the door opened. Ying Bing entered, carrying a lunch box. With light, graceful steps, she sat by the head of the bed and saw that Li Mo's face was practically screaming 'patient,' which made her want to laugh.

"Eat."

"Ah, Ice Cube, you're back. What time is it now?"

Li Mo opened his eyes in a daze, as if he had just woken up.

Ying Bing placed the dishes one by one on the small table on the bed.

A pair of chopsticks was also placed in front of Li Mo.

"Go ahead."

"How am I supposed to eat?"

Li Mo looked even more confused.

Ice Cube had been feeding him for the past three days.

Ying Bing's expression was blank:

"With your hands, holding the chopsticks, of course."

".....Alright, I'll try."

The best actor, Li Mo, trembled as he reached for the chopsticks. After several attempts, he finally managed to grab them.

But in the end, he couldn't hold them tight, and the chopsticks slipped from his fingers.

This performance was full of effort, yet tinged with a hint of helplessness, just right.

He was truly a little genius of acting!

Finally, Li Mo sighed and said:

"Ah... I knew it. Ice Cube, you eat first. I have to rely on myself..."

"......Fine, I'll do it."

Ying Bing didn't expose him. She took off her shoes and got on the bed, sitting with her legs folded to the side.

"Sorry to trouble you, Ice Cube. The duck blood is delicious."

"This sweet tofu pudding is great. The chef at this restaurant really understands me. Sweet is the way to go!"

Li Mo ate while seriously critiquing the food.

It was just that his hands were a bit idle. When they were idle, they would accidentally touch something.

So he touched a pair of delicate, dainty little feet.

The perfectly round, pinkish toes immediately curled up.

"Hm? What's wrong? Is the sweet tofu not good?"

"It's good, but didn't you say you didn't have the strength in your hands?"

"That's right."

Hearing this, Ying Bing's gaze became profound. She felt the force on her little foot—gentle kneading, sometimes light, sometimes heavy, just right...

*Ice Cube listening to your excuses.jpg.*

Li Mo thought about it seriously and said:

"My hands really don't have any strength, I can't even lift my arms. But as everyone knows, things with color, aroma, and taste easily stimulate the appetite, which is good for my appetite..."

"Eating well and being in a good mood are both beneficial for recovering from my injuries. This is all for the sake of making a quick recovery."

"Moreover, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, which shows how important the soles of the feet are. I'm also doing this for your health..."

Chef Li spouted a stream of nonsense with a serious expression.

"......"

Ying Bing glanced at her little foot.

*What does that have to do with color, aroma, and taste?*

She gently bit her lip and stuffed a piece of beef into his mouth, shutting up that nonsensical talk.

A moment later.

Li Mo had finished his meal.

Ying Bing ate her own food, occasionally shivering slightly. She was completely distracted by the meal. The fact that she almost poked her chopsticks into Li Mo's nose just now was proof of that.

After the meal.

She pulled her little feet back, pursed her lips, and said coldly:

"I originally had a method that could help you recover faster, but it seems that's not possible now."

"What method?"

Li Mo felt a bit unsatisfied, his palm feeling empty.

---

Ying Bing thought for a moment and said softly:

"I have two pieces of cultivation attire that are beneficial for dual cultivation. They can harmonize yin and yang, and double the effect."

"What do they look like?"

Li Mo was a bit confused.

This was the first time he had heard of such a thing.

Ying Bing nodded, then unscrewed the head of the big-headed doll and took out two pieces of clothing from inside.

One was the Taiyin Immortal Skirt she had worn not long ago.

The other was naturally that Pure Yang Robe.

One was entirely dark in color, embroidered with silver threads depicting the moon, mysterious and noble. The other was entirely white, with golden threads depicting the sun, righteous and dignified.

"These are... cultivation attire?"

"Mm."

"......"

Li Mo looked them over. The two pieces of clothing, when placed there, gave off the illusion that they were about to stick together.

What kind of righteous sect designs cultivation attire like this?

The Pleased Union Sect?

"Anyway, you can't even lift your arms right now, so you can't put on the robe."

Ying Bing's eyes shimmered as she was about to put both pieces of clothing away.

"Eh? It's so strange, I suddenly feel a surge of primordial power."

Li Mo stood up, looking amazed as he raised his arms, showing that he was full of life and perfectly capable of changing his clothes.

A medical miracle.

Ying Bing: "?"

"Let's wear our couple's outfits together!"

Li Mo said excitedly.

"It's cultivation attire. Change into it, and then we'll start cultivating."

"Can you only wear this when cultivating?"

"You can only wear it when you're with me."

"So this is just..."

"You said your hands can't exert strength, you can't even hold chopsticks."

"It's just cultivation attire."

Li Mo nodded, with a righteous expression, indicating that what Ice Cube said was correct.

After all, who says cultivation attire can only be worn during cultivation?

This is just cultivation attire that can be worn when you're together.

Student Li and Ice Cube reached a certain tacit understanding.

Student Li wouldn't mention the couple's outfits, and Ice Cube wouldn't mention the fact that he had staged a medical miracle and made her serve him for several days on purpose.

Not long after.

Li Mo changed into his clothes and stood in front of the bronze mirror to look at himself.

*Tsk.*

Clothes make the man, as the saying goes. It really is true. After his trip to the Southern Frontier, he seemed to have grown a little taller, and this robe fit him perfectly.

The temperament also matched perfectly, adding a bit more sunshine and righteous dignity to the gentle and modest Student Li.

With this appearance, who would see him and not call him a gentleman?

"Ice Cube, are you ready?"

"Mm."

Not long after, Ying Bing also emerged from behind the screen and stood beside him.

Instantly, a pair of perfect match appeared in the mirror.

The young man was bright and sunny, the young woman was cool and serene.

"We're wearing our cultivation attire, let's cultivate quickly."

Ying Bing's eyes trembled slightly. She felt that the hint of shyness in the mirror was a bit刺眼 (stinging to the eyes)...

"Okay."

Li Mo nodded, and the two of them sat on the edge of the bed.

Before Ying Bing could even reach out her hand, she saw that so-called gentleman Li Mo bend down to take off her boots.

"? What are you doing."

"I want to see if holding a foot is the same as holding a hand."

Li Mo was very serious, as if researching a very serious matter:

"If holding a foot is the same, then wouldn't it be possible to get a foot massage while dual cultivating?"

"A foot massage is good for physical and mental health. It might make the dual cultivation effect even more powerful!"

He was a genius!
