# Chapter 22: The Demon Hiding in the Secluded Immortal Sect!

The night was deep, and the atmosphere was deathly silent.

Li Zhengjing stood to the side, holding his breath without speaking.

Meanwhile, the wall-hanging bird remained stiff as the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official's claws poked and prodded at it.

"Your body hasn't fully developed yet—you're too small. Giving you a complete makeover will require delicate craftsmanship."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official shook his head in frustration. "If you were fully grown, I could have finished this tonight! But as you are now, you're just too tiny..."

"Then maybe..." the bird whispered, "we should just forget about it? I think I already look quite majestic and handsome as I am..."

"That won't do." The Spiritual Official slowly shook his head. "Years ago, I had already considered how to modify a White Phoenix Divine Bird, but your grandfather refused to let me experiment on him. Now that you're here, all my plans and ideas from back then can finally be realized!"

"I..." The bird nearly burst into tears.

"Don't be afraid. I've been refining my modifications for the White Phoenix Divine Bird for over a decade—the chance of success is as high as thirty percent!"

The Spiritual Official reassured it, "Besides, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect only allowed me to live here in seclusion because your grandfather spoke up for me. Out of gratitude, I'll be extra careful with the procedure. There's a solid sixty percent chance you'll survive—round it up, and it's practically guaranteed! I promise I won't kill you easily. Seriously, just relax..."

The bird's eyes rolled back, and it fainted.

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official sighed and turned to Li Zhengjing. "I'll examine its body first. Wait outside."

As he spoke, his left golden eye suddenly fell out of its socket, dangling by thin threads of sinew.

Li Zhengjing felt a chill run down his spine, his mouth going dry.

"Apologies. This black tortoise's eye, even after modification, still doesn't fit quite right—it tends to fall out. Just needs a little more trimming."

The Spiritual Official stuffed the eye back in and waved dismissively.

Li Zhengjing exhaled in relief and stepped outside, finally able to breathe freely.

The young man sat nearby, lost in thought, paying no attention to Li Zhengjing.

Seeing this, Li Zhengjing remained silent and took a seat beside him.

The atmosphere was heavy, and the faint metallic clinking from inside only made the wait more unbearable. To calm his nerves, Li Zhengjing pulled out the case file and began reading.

"First case—the victim was an ordinary civilian, body desiccated, blood completely drained?"

"After the incident, local officials sent investigators, but two of them also died mysteriously, their blood sucked dry."

"Only after the officials' deaths did the case gain attention. Officer Wu led a team to investigate, found traces of the culprit, and gave chase."

"The culprit was too fast—only Officer Wu, a former outer disciple of the Immortal Sect, managed to follow the trail."

"By the time the others caught up, they found Officer Wu decapitated, his blood spilled everywhere."

"According to the investigation, Officer Wu was killed in a single strike, but the culprit didn't have time to drain his blood?"

"With such skill, the demon must at least be at the 'Inner Qi' level. But if it had that kind of power, it could have slaughtered all the pursuers!"

"Why did it flee in such a hurry, leaving the blood behind?"

Li Zhengjing frowned. The records ended there. In the following days, there were no further traces of the killer, nor any new victims.

After the incident, the authorities tightened security across the region, but no suspicious activity was detected.

If that was the case, the culprit might still be hiding here and hadn't fled!

"Good. If it had escaped, I'd have to track it down elsewhere."

Just as Li Zhengjing thought this, a voice spoke beside him.

"It's still here."

The apothecary's assistant remained expressionless. "Yesterday, it was staying on the next street. After nightfall, it moved again—not sure where it went now..."

Li Zhengjing turned sharply to look at the cold-faced youth.

The assistant paid no heed and continued, "It probably came from the north. The reason it dares to commit crimes within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's territory is because it's searching for something. As of yesterday, it still hadn't found what it wanted."

To commit crimes under the Immortal Sect's watch, knowing it would draw attention, yet still stay to search?

Was this northern cultivator so desperate for this object that it was willing to risk death?

Li Zhengjing stood and bowed slightly. "Brother, do you know what it's looking for?"

The youth replied flatly, "I don't know what it is, but it must be extremely valuable. Because... that old bastard inside also wants it."

He pointed toward the inner room.

Even the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official coveted this thing?

"With the elder's abilities, if this object were in Qixing Prefecture, wouldn't he have already taken it?"

"This is the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's domain!"

The youth said slowly, "Before the old bastard went into seclusion here, he swore an oath to the Immortal Sect—he would live here as an ordinary man and never use any cultivator's abilities."

After a pause, he added, "Just looking at him, you can tell he has a bad reputation. In truth, he's a notorious demon. But seventeen years ago, during the Fengdu Mountain battle, he used his medical skills to save thirty-two of the Immortal Sect's elders—one of whom was the White Firmament Venerable."

"Because of his service, the Immortal Sect turned a blind eye to his presence instead of exterminating him."

The youth continued, "If you can retrieve that object, the old bastard will be overjoyed. He might even grant you a tremendous opportunity."

Li Zhengjing frowned, sensing something odd.

This youth didn't seem like a good person and was usually tight-lipped—why was he explaining so patiently now?

Moreover, he had assumed the youth was the Spiritual Official's disciple, yet the latter kept calling him "old bastard" with clear hatred in his tone.

Before Li Zhengjing could speak, the youth went on.

"The old man hides here to use the Immortal Sect as shelter from his enemies."

"But if he obtains that object, he can find a place even safer than the Immortal Sect's territory—somewhere his enemies will never find him."

"And when that happens, I won't have to serve this old bastard anymore."

The cold-faced youth's expression darkened with murderous intent. "Every time I see him, I feel sick to my stomach."

"Fan Kaihu, I merely killed your entire family and wiped out your clan—is it really worth holding such a grudge?"

A hoarse voice chuckled from inside. "Besides, I refined your entire clan's essence into your body, purifying your bloodline and transforming your mediocre bones into a rare talent. Didn't you agree to that?"

"You old bastard!"

The youth stood abruptly, snarling, "I wanted this supreme talent to cultivate immortality! But you keep me bound here, denying me any cultivation methods—what use is this talent to me?!"

"I only promised to make you a rare genius—not to let you cultivate."

The curtain lifted as the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official stepped out, his face kind. "But I am a merciful man. If one day I find my opportunity and leave the Immortal Sect, I'll allow you to seek a master among the immortal sects..."

With that, he ignored the youth named Fan Kaihu and turned to Li Zhengjing. "I've sworn an oath—within the Immortal Sect's domain, I cannot use any cultivator's abilities, so I can't help you capture that demonic cultivator. However, I can give you some advice. For this case... you should start investigating from half a month ago."
