# Chapter 56: The Cultivation Tycoon  

Xiao Ji realized that purchasing Foundation Establishment Pills directly would be far more cost-effective than refining them himself. After all, professional alchemists had specialized equipment—mystic-grade cauldrons that could be reused, wood spirits capable of tending multiple batches simultaneously…  

If he were to gather the materials himself, the cost would easily exceed fifty thousand spirit stones, not to mention the time and effort required to hunt the necessary demons.  

Breaking through to Foundation Establishment was proving far more challenging than he had imagined.  

For the first time, he truly understood the despair of those talented cultivators who never managed to cross the threshold into Foundation Establishment.  

All because they lacked the resources.  

Without wealth, progress in cultivation became impossible.  

If the search for materials dragged on, years could slip away—and many perished along the way.  

This was why so many prodigies strayed onto dark paths, committing unthinkable acts for the sake of cultivation resources.  

As he pondered this, a portly cultivator entered the Eight Trigrams Plaza. After surveying the "Cultivation World" section, the man retrieved a notice from his golden storage ring and posted it on the board.  

A crowd quickly gathered, eager to see what task had been posted. Someone read it aloud:  

"Seeking team to hunt Skywing Tiger Demons. Location: Sleeping Tiger Pool, southeast of the Nine Nether Valley… Reward: One thousand spirit stones…"  

Most shook their heads and dispersed, muttering complaints.  

"Sleeping Tiger Pool is deep in the Nine Nether Valley—too far, and the terrain is treacherous, crawling with demons."  

"Killing a Skywing Tiger isn't hard, but the pay is too low. No one would take this job."  

"Exactly. I could hunt a first-grade, tenth-tier Skywing Tiger myself and sell it in Taigu City for at least three thousand spirit stones."  

"Teaming up makes sense for weaker cultivators, but no one would bother for this."  

"You're all missing the real issue. Skywing Tigers vary in strength—some in the Nine Nether Valley are second-grade!"  

Soon, the notice was all but forgotten.  

Xiao Ji, however, lingered. This was his first time hearing about group hunts for demon beasts, so he paid closer attention.  

**[Qian Duoyu: Qi Refinement, Fifth Layer.]**  

Xiao Ji frowned.  

Taigu City's entry requirement was Qi Refinement, Sixth Layer. How had this fifth-layer cultivator gotten in?  

He deepened his perception.  

"Pulled strings. The city officials initially refused, but Grandmaster Sanyun personally intervened to grant access… Reason: His father sponsored three new sky-ships for the city, funded renovations for all major landmarks, and pledged to develop a new spirit herb garden."  

Xiao Ji mentally reviewed the information, feeling as if he'd stumbled upon a goldmine.  

"Tsk tsk… This guy cultivates like a man possessed, swallowing pills like candy—even overdosed twice… Came to Taigu City just to 'see the world' because he was bored at home…"  

Xiao Ji stared at the wealthy cultivator, astonished.  

*What kind of family is this? What kind of father?*  

But despite the absurd wealth poured into his cultivation, Qian Duoyu remained stuck at the fifth layer.  

Xiao Ji couldn't help but think of his own impoverished Origin God Temple. If only his master had been this rich, so many troubles could have been avoided.  

"What's his background?" Xiao Ji dug deeper.  

**[His family owns several major spirit stone mines.]**  

That explained it. Mine tycoons had deep pockets and could hire elite tutors, but their status remained low. Many were desperate to elevate their descendants, hence the reckless spending on cultivation resources.  

Money was no object.  

Now fully informed, Xiao Ji noted Qian Duoyu's quirks—like the "one thousand spirit stones" listed in his notice.  

The man rarely used yellow-grade spirit stones, and this was his first time in Taigu City. Unfamiliar with local customs and indifferent to details, he'd failed to specify that his offer was in *mystic-grade* spirit stones—each worth ten yellow-grade ones.  

In the cultivation world, "spirit stones" unqualified always meant yellow-grade. Higher grades had to be explicitly stated.  

Qian Duoyu had overlooked this.  

Thus, his offer was actually *ten thousand* yellow-grade spirit stones for a first-grade, twelfth-tier Skywing Tiger.  

Given the market price of three thousand, his generosity made perfect sense—for someone of his background.  

But why would a tycoon like him want such a low-tier demon beast?  

If he wanted a pet, a word to his father or a public bounty would suffice.  

**[Qian Duoyu had a sudden craving for fresh Skywing Tiger meat. The city's restaurants were out, so he decided to hunt one himself—partly for the experience.]**  

"Now *that's* privilege," Xiao Ji mused.  

---  

Dejected, Qian Duoyu sighed. "Father was right. Money isn't omnipotent. Even spirit stones can't solve everything."  

As he tore down the notice, preparing to visit the auction house for entertainment, a Daoist priest approached him with a warm smile.  

"Fellow Daoist, I happen to be heading to the Nine Nether Valley. I'll join you." Xiao Ji calmly took the notice and skimmed it.  

"But with just the two of us… Ideally, we'd have a few more." Qian Duoyu glanced at the chatting cultivators around them. "No one seems interested, even at this price."  

"No matter. The two of us are enough."  

"Oh?" Qian Duoyu perked up. "What's your cultivation level? Core Formation?"  

"Great Perfection of Qi Refinement." Xiao Ji didn't inflate his strength.  

"That might not be enough… They say the Nine Nether Valley is dangerous."  

"Then how about this: I'll go alone and capture the Skywing Tiger for you."  

"I couldn't impose. I *do* want the experience—the thrill of the hunt." Despite his wealth, Qian Duoyu wasn't arrogant. "Let's go together."  

Thus, the two formed a temporary team, agreeing to depart for the Nine Nether Valley at dawn.  

As they parted, Xiao Ji felt a surge of satisfaction.  

First, he stood to earn a thousand mystic-grade spirit stones—enough for at least a low-grade Foundation Establishment Pill. With a bit more effort, even a high-grade one was within reach.  

Second, he'd discovered a new way to earn spirit stones in the city.  

If Taigu City's shops needed demon beast meat, they'd need hunters to supply it—the rarer the beast, the higher the price.  

The same logic applied elsewhere: clinics needed wild spirit herbs, smithies sought rare minerals…  

Opportunities abounded.
