# Chapter 4: Passing the Test

The gates of Pingyin County had already closed, making it impossible to enter at this hour. Fortunately, there were also some merchants from out of town camped outside, resting because they couldn't enter the city. Chen Fei joined a campfire, listening to the hushed conversations around him, and his tense mood slowly relaxed.

Quite a lot had happened today. If not for his breakthrough in strength, Chen Fei would now be lying stiff on Pingyin Mountain. Thinking of this, Chen Fei couldn't help but look at his panel.

**Name: Chen Fei**
**Profession: Martial Artist**
**Cultivation Methods: Extreme Mountain Fist (Proficient 307/1000), Extreme Mountain Breathing Technique (Great Perfection)**
**Realm: Skin-Refinement (2/1000)**

Extreme Mountain Fist had already reached the proficient level, and insights related to the fist technique still echoed in Chen Fei's mind. He could only say that this simplification function was truly powerful.

“The progress in the Skin-Refinement realm hasn't changed.”

Chen Fei frowned slightly as he looked at his cultivation realm. Before his breakthrough, the Great Perfection Extreme Mountain Breathing Technique would grant about 10 points of cultivation increase. Yet, half a day had passed since his breakthrough, and it had only increased by 1 point.

While the servants weren't worth much, they were still assets of the medical hall. Now, over a dozen had died, and more critically, the medicinal herbs hadn't been gathered. This was extremely troublesome for the medical hall. When the master of the house questioned them later, he would likely bear some responsibility.

“As for the lives of the others, this junior is unaware. But last night, at the city gates, I indeed saw no one else,” Chen Fei said in a low voice.

“Everyone else died, why are you perfectly fine?” A hoarse voice asked, laced with accusation.

Chen Fei looked up. It was Pu Liao, a guard from the medical hall. Chen Fei cupped his fists and said, “This junior broke through to the Skin-Refinement realm, thus escaping this calamity.” As Chen Fei spoke, he threw a punch, and a dull thud echoed in the air.

The expressions of the few people around him subtly changed. Such a powerful punch was impossible for an ordinary person. Their only surprise was that someone among the servants had actually elevated their martial cultivation to the Skin-Refinement realm. Although the Skin-Refinement realm was nothing to boast about, it still surpassed ordinary people. Without a certain degree of martial talent, one truly couldn't reach it. And with the Skin-Refinement realm, by being careful, one could indeed evade some of the anomalies.

“Not bad.”

The main reason Chen Fei decided to stay at the medical hall was that he could learn some medical skills and alchemy there, which he valued more. After Cui Sanjie and the others asked Chen Fei a few more questions, they left one after another.

“I’m busy these days. Come find me in a few days, and I’ll teach you a cultivation method.” Pu Liao walked up to Chen Fei, said this plainly, then turned and left.

Once everyone had left, Chen Fei breathed a slight sigh of relief. This test was over. Without his Skin-Refinement realm cultivation, he would certainly not have escaped a beating and insults. Because he now had some value, all of that had been spared. The medical hall arranged a private room for Chen Fei. Although it was still small, it was a world of difference compared to his previous treatment. Chen Fei was quite satisfied, as this meant he wouldn't have to worry about revealing anything while cultivating.
