# Chapter 202: Gradually Falling, Natural Charm

Madam Wen wiped her long sword and put it away in her sleeve.

Li Xian was greatly astonished. He couldn't help but recall scenes such as binding the silkworm garment and bathing together in Yin and Yang. He had helped the Madam undress, untie her waistbands, and tie up her long hair... Yet, despite such intimacy, he had never seen this soft sword before. He wondered where it was hidden beneath her clothes.

Bear Langjun, ugly and grotesque, lay fallen to the ground. Hearing Li Xian's question, Madam Wen pondered for a moment. She figured Li Xian indeed had the qualifications to know, so she said, "The Dragon Appreciation Banquet and the Dragon Slaying Banquet are feasts centered around dragons."

"A dragon's feast?" Li Xian was confused. "Does the world truly have dragons?"

"Of course, there are," Madam Wen said. "The Great Wu Empire has vast territory, and there are already hundreds of known locations with dragon traces."

"Your 'Setting Sun Fading Blood Sword' is progressing well. You will also have the honor of witnessing this grand Dragon Appreciation Banquet."

Speaking of this, Madam Wen frowned slightly and suddenly struck Bear Langjun with a palm. Her internal Qi pierced through the ground with a thunderous rumble, sending snow and sand flying.

Bear Langjun's clothes were torn to shreds, yet his limbs remained intact, not mangled or bloody. As the smoke cleared, a hole appeared on the ground, leading far away. He had escaped.

Madam Wen murmured, "Earth Merging Technique?"

It turned out that although Bear Langjun's heart had been pierced, he did not die immediately. Knowing he was no match for the Madam, he planned his escape.

In his decades of martial world experience, he had encountered numerous fortuitous events and obtained the recipe for [Earth Merging Soup]. Over the years, he had painstakingly sought it out and consumed seven or eight corresponding elixirs. He was on the verge of mastering the 'Earth Merging Technique.'

However, something went wrong along the way. The Earth Merging Technique became the Earth Merging Technique. This technique was quite useless; when cast, the body merged with the soil, as if sinking into water. But the soil was coarse, and he could only merge shallowly into the surface. It was truly a useless skill.

But having obtained a precious technique, he naturally studied it diligently. Although the technique was useless, when paired with martial arts, it could produce unexpected effects.

He had trained in the "Earth Breaking Art," a martial art from the "Nine Dipper Sect." It was adept at digging holes. It involved channeling internal Qi into the ground to apply a shock force, quickly excavating a pit.

Bear Langjun combined his precious technique with his martial art. He played dead, fell to the ground, cast the technique to merge into the earth, and then secretly used the Earth Breaking Art to escape. This allowed him to feign death and flee underground.

It was the first time he had used it in his life, and it indeed saved his life.

During their conversation, he had already fled far away. Li Xian asked, "Madam, should we pursue him?"

"Let him live," Madam Wen said.

Li Xian thought to himself, *What kind of temperament does the Madam have? She wouldn't easily let him off.* It seemed Bear Langjun was quite formidable to escape from the Madam's grasp. However... the Madam's tracking methods were miraculous. She could find Qiu Yue even when buried deep underground. How could Bear Langjun escape?

"Bear Langjun's martial arts attainments are indeed impressive. But perhaps the reason the Madam couldn't catch him has nothing to do with his martial arts."

Evening fell.

The guards had all come out of the mountains and gathered in the clearing in front of the mountain. Ding Hu muttered, "Strange and odd, why haven't the Madam and the others come out yet?"

They looked into the distance.

The sun was setting behind the mountains; night was approaching.

The most exhilarating part of hunting in the mountains and wilds was returning to tally the spoils. In previous years, regardless of whether the guards' spoils were many or few, the Madam would always inspect them.

Suddenly, the sound of galloping hooves was heard. Li Xian rode his horse out of the forest, with Madam Wen close behind. The two were whispering to each other, their expressions intimate. Madam Wen nodded frequently, the coldness in her eyes replaced by a hint of charm and displeasure.

Soon, Li Xian rode over to Ding Hu and said, "Brothers, you have all worked hard. I just spoke with the Madam. It is already late, and tallying the spoils will take time. How about this..."

"Everyone, take the spoils back to the manor and register them with Uncle Xiang. The Madam has granted you all a night off and has ordered the kitchen to prepare a banquet of a hundred beasts in the manor. May you brothers eat and drink to your heart's content."

The guards cheered and returned to the manor with their spoils.

Soon, only Li Xian and Madam Wen remained. Madam Wen smiled and said, "Three days of hunting, who won and who lost, it is time to find out." She untied the flesh-contracting bag and poured out her spoils.

Tigers, bears, deer...

There were ten or twenty of each, dazzling. Among them, bears were the most numerous: scaled bears, stone-breaking bears, iron-hard bears... all standing two zhang tall, robust and shaggy.

"Xiao Xian, come here," Madam Wen said, walking to a scaled bear's side. Li Xian handed her the Sinking River Sword.

The blade was sharp; a light scratch could break the scales and skin.

Under the bear hide, there were actually human bodies.

The scaled bear was about two zhang tall, and there were three human bodies inside the bear skin. None were whole; their joints were twisted and stitched together to fit the bear suit perfectly.

Madam Wen said, "This Bear Langjun and the Jar Immortal are of the same ilk. He is the Jar Immortal's martial uncle."

"He likes to capture living people, soak them in special medicinal baths, then twist their joints and break their tendons. He uses mind-control techniques to manipulate them. He hides in the deep mountains, raising many 'bear children' to form a Bear Child Array. He intended to use them as筹码 for the future Dragon Slaying Banquet."

"Coincidentally, I ran into him. He suffered great losses, and his efforts were ruined."

"When you walk the martial world in the future, if you encounter such people, try to avoid them. These evil heretics may not achieve great things, but they are always disgusting."

"They are all figures from the 'Blood Pool and Meat Forest.' Most of the异 bears we hunted today are like this. Let's burn them all."

Li Xian carried all the异 bears to one spot. He piled them with dry firewood and hay, then used the Setting Sun Fading Blood Sword. Two sword beams flashed, igniting the firewood.

Flames soared into the sky.

Madam Wen smiled and asked, "Who won this competition?"

The remaining tigers and deer were roughly equal in number. Li Xian counted them all and laughed heartily, "Madam, I won."

Madam Wen raised her slender eyebrows slightly. "What nonsense. The numbers of tigers and deer are similar. You have two more tigers than me, but I have four more deer than you. They cancel each other out. How did you win?"

Li Xian said, "Did the Madam forget? We ate that colorful little deer."

Hearing this, the Madam shook her head and laughed softly. "You little brat... In that case, you really did win. What reward do you want? Just say it."

"I need to think it over carefully. I'll tell you when we get back to the manor," Li Xian said.

"Alright," Madam Wen nodded.

Inside the manor.

The spacious clearing was set with tables and chairs. The kitchen showed off its skills, turning the wild game into delicious dishes.

The guards ate to their hearts' content.

Deep in the inner courtyard, Madam Wen asked again, "Have you decided what reward you want?"

Li Xian knew the Madam was wealthy. Martial arts, money, treasures, rare medicines, precious artifacts... the list was endless. Obtaining any one would be a lifetime of benefit. He wanted a lightness skill to make up for a gap in his martial arts, or a superior or intermediate martial art to broaden his horizons. Any one would be very useful.

However, on the way back to the manor, he had thought it over carefully. He felt it wasn't quite right. *If I ask for martial arts manuals, treasures, or money... how do I gauge the extent? If I ask for too much, I might displeasure the Madam, fail to get the treasure, and even get scolded. If I ask for too little, it's just boring. Better to...*

Li Xian said, "Madam, will you definitely grant what I ask for?"

Madam Wen crossed her legs, her slender waist like a willow branch, looking intrigued. "Naturally. What are you plotting?"

"I want..." Li Xian smiled. "I want a lot. On the way, I almost asked for martial arts manuals, rare treasures, or silver money. But now, sitting before the Madam, I only want one thing."

He was naturally skilled at mixing truth and falsehood. Li Xian considered himself honest, but deep down, he was romantic and free-spirited. Sweet words to please women came to him effortlessly, spoken with genuine emotion and sincerity. If not for this talent, even with his high aptitude, how could he have made the Madam change step by step and develop feelings?

Madam Wen's pretty face flushed slightly. She felt a sudden sense of romance, joy rising in her heart. She asked calmly, "Let's hear it."

"I want to hug the Madam," Li Xian said sincerely.

Madam Wen's heart felt as sweet as if wrapped in honey. Seeing Li Xian's sincere expression, it didn't seem fake. She said, "We have bathed together many times. What is a hug? I am rewarding you. The opportunity is rare. Think about it some more."

Li Xian said, "But... Madam..."

"That is my only thought right now. To make me think of other rewards is truly asking the impossible. Whether I think east, west, south, or north... this is my only request."

Madam Wen's joy grew stronger. She was experienced in feng shui and the ways of the martial world, but who dared to speak love words to her? Even among love words, there were good and bad. To hit the mark and touch her heart was the rarest of all.

She feigned displeasure. "You little brat, you are becoming more and more audacious. Fine. Is it so hard for me to fulfill this little wish of yours?"

Her pretty face was red, but she maintained her composure well; an outsider would never notice. She said, "Come here then."

She felt him crash into her warm embrace, his chest broad and solid. The warm body temperature was like a soul-stirring love potion. She felt intoxicated and couldn't help but feel quite attached.

Li Xian also held the fragrant jade, the scent wafting into his nose.

Madam Wen said, "Are you satisfied now?" Li Xian said, "Madam, I want to take an inch more."

Madam Wen coquettishly rebuked, "Absolutely not." She flipped out of his embrace, feeling a moment of reluctance.

Li Xian still had her fragrance on him. He had guessed correctly. The so-called reward was just something Madam Wen said casually to stir up his fighting spirit. If Li Xian had asked for something, she might not have refused.

Intermediate martial arts, rare treasures... how precious. The Madam was wealthy, but she would not give them away lightly. If Li Xian had asked for such things, he would definitely get nothing. Instead, the Madam would think: *This boy values profit. Even if he is loyal to me, his heart is not pure; it contains calculations of benefit.*

She put herself in his shoes and would certainly think that way.

If he didn't ask for anything, she also had reason to be displeased.

The winter hunt was over.

The remaining days were uneventful. In his spare time from practicing martial arts, Li Xian strolled around the manor and visited various places in Qingning County.

Although he didn't get a reward, the Madam's attitude clearly changed.

Early December.

By this time, Li Xian's Setting Sun Fading Blood Sword, first and second layers, were both nearing perfection. If he didn't restrain himself, he would reach perfection very soon.

Li Xian was worried the Madam would get suspicious. Aside from using the Twin Sword Combination, he no longer touched this sword art. He focused all his private energy on the [Vast Misty Legs].

The leg technique was ethereal, and the martial art gradually showed its uniqueness. When kicking, mist surrounded him, confusing the vision.

His leg strength gradually increased. Combining the Vast Misty Legs and the Breeze Legs, his movement speed became extremely fast.

[Vast Misty Legs]
[Proficiency: 1096/3000 Small Success]

Qi Lake: 44 zhang.

Li Xian actually enjoyed these days. *Progress amidst peace, no wind or waves. Once I handle the Madam, I can solve many troubles.*

But seeing the tall, sturdy ancient tree in the manor, Li Xian's heart trembled. He still wanted to stand tall and independent, not relying on others.

He had to become stronger!

Kindness could be repaid, and grudges could be avenged.

That day.

Li Xian helped the Madam with her closed-door training and collected his monthly stipend. Just as he was about to leave the manor, he suddenly heard a noisy voice: "Boy, boy... come here."

Sitting on a toad's head in the dense grass was the Black Asura. Li Xian walked over quickly and grabbed it, asking, "How did you get out again?"

The Black Asura cursed, "Ouch, easy, easy. Why are you so strong! I'm just curious about your progress. How are you two doing?"

"You're quite the gossip," Li Xian laughed.

"Quick, tell me. Did you take down that evil woman?" the Black Asura asked curiously.

Before Li Xian could answer, the Black Asura continued, "You boy, you're too shy, too honest. It's obvious you haven't made much progress. To deal with a woman like that, you should be direct and bold. Make her love and hate you, unable to let go, living in agony. You... keep trying!"

Li Xian's mouth twitched. "You know quite a lot. What exactly are you?"

"Speaking of that, we have to go back to the distant Great Yu era," the Black Asura said. "If you want to hear it, I'll tell you slowly. Last time, there was a thief, quite famous in the martial world. He came to steal something..."

"He chatted with me for a bit. That feeling... I've never been so satisfied in my life. I told him about the Black Master's glorious past."

"He listened with great interest. But... he was found by that evil woman. Man, his tongue was cut out, his bones were broken, and his tendons were severed. Ouch, it was tragic... I'm just like you now..."

Li Xian knew the Black Asura was full of nonsense. He should just listen and not take it seriously. But thinking of the disabled slaves in the Hidden Martial Pavilion, he decided to be safe and said, "Stop! I don't want to hear it." He ran back to the Yunxiang Pavilion and locked the Black Asura up again.
