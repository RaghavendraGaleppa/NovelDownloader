# Chapter 15: Strike First to Prevent a Hundred Blows

Wang Chan thought his eyes were playing tricks on him. He looked again at the virtual panel before him.

**Magic Artifact (1/3): Minor Withering-Blooming Needle (Low-grade, Artifact Restrictions: 21/21, Restrictions Fully Unlocked, Can Be Divinized)**

Wang Chan froze for a moment, then his breathing quickened. He nearly threw himself at the panel, scrutinizing the information over a dozen times before finally stopping.

What did "divinization" mean?

Wang Chan burned with impatience as he tried to guess. Unfortunately, the panel offered no detailed explanation for the term, leaving him in the dark.

Still, it didn't take much thought to realize it must involve some kind of upgrade for the Minor Withering-Blooming Needle. The only problem was that divinization required sixty-three experience points—three times the amount needed to fully unlock the needle's restrictions—which he couldn't afford right now.

If he focused solely on grinding experience, it would take a little over two months. That was a long time. With that many points, he could also fully unlock the restrictions of **[Spring-Returning Cloud-Pushing Technique]**.

Wang Chan fell into deep thought.

After a while, he stood up, paced for a bit, and finally made up his mind. He would ignore **[Spring-Returning Cloud-Pushing Technique]** for now and instead save up experience to divinize the **[Minor Withering-Blooming Needle]**. 

The needle was already sufficient for his current medical needs. More importantly, it also had decent offensive capabilities. If divinization could further enhance it, his self-defense would naturally improve. 

Increasing his combat power as quickly as possible meant he could sleep more soundly at night.

However, sixty-plus experience points meant he needed at least sixty-plus bottles of **[Vitality Nurturing Elixir]**, costing around a hundred spirit coins. Right now, he only had sixty-something coins on him.

"I'll just have to earn another forty spirit coins within two months…"

Because he had been too absorbed in contemplating the divinization of the **[Minor Withering-Blooming Needle]** the night before, Wang Chan found himself yawning incessantly early the next morning. He had no choice but to catch another hour of sleep.

"Never travel when exhausted, never exhaust yourself while traveling."

After all, the journey to the Black River Market was over eighty li. Though the path was well-trodden and regularly patrolled, the lingering threat of Three-Eyed Crimson Hounds and Tiger Jiao loomed in his mind like a dark cloud. 

No matter what, it never hurt to be cautious.

Whether it was his imagination or not, the Black River Market seemed more crowded with cultivators today compared to a couple of days ago. Every now and then, he spotted cultivators whose attire and demeanor stood out, giving the impression they weren't locals.

Subconsciously, Wang Chan headed to the bearded merchant's stall and found that the price of **[Vitality Nurturing Elixir]** had risen by another ten spirit pearls—and judging by the trend, it would likely keep climbing.

Wang Chan tried to fish for the reason behind the price hike, but the bearded man just shook his head repeatedly. Whether he genuinely didn’t know or was simply unwilling to say remained unclear.

To get a fuller picture, Wang Chan visited several other shops, inquiring about various rare materials. Sure enough, the prices of many cultivation resources had risen. 

Without further hesitation, he purchased thirty portions of **[Vitality Nurturing Elixir]** in batches before heading to the medical district to set up his stall.

But as soon as he arrived, he spotted a female cultivator in apricot-yellow robes from a distance. She was curvaceous and alluring, like a ripe peach. She stood next to his stall, visibly annoyed by a man in gray robes pestering her.

The man had narrow, squinty eyes and a somewhat sinister appearance. With thirty-two strands of magic power, he was tall and imposing, forcing an obnoxious smile as he glanced around and spoke. The female cultivator kept shaking her head in refusal.

When she noticed Wang Chan approaching from afar, the man finally gave up and slunk away, looking disgruntled.

The female cultivator’s tense expression immediately brightened at the sight of Wang Chan. She casually tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, feigning modesty as she stood there waiting for him.

"Brother Wang," she whispered, leaning in close once he was near, "that man who called himself Tang Song was saying all sorts of nasty things about you and trying to coax me into letting him massage my feet."

"Oh? Am I really that bad?" Wang Chan replied with a smirk.

This robed cultivator had visited him a few days prior for acupuncture on her sore feet and had clearly enjoyed the experience. Now she was back.

"How could someone as refined and handsome as you be bad?" She giggled behind her hand, her gaze lingering. "And even if you were a little bad… I wouldn’t mind."

*This woman… must be starving.* 

Though familiarity might breed comfort, Wang Chan mentally shook his head. Still, as a returning customer, he decided he might as well give her a proper, satisfying session later.

After exchanging a few more words, Wang Chan gestured for her to wait a moment. Then his expression darkened as he marched straight toward Tang Song. Without hesitation, he smashed Tang Song’s stall to pieces and even kicked the door off its hinges.

"Wang Chan! What the hell are you doing?!" Tang Song stared in disbelief before finally snapping out of it, his face twisting in fury as he reached for his storage pouch.

In the past, he had pulled similar stunts without consequence—Wang Chan had never dared to utter a word of protest. After all, Wang Chan was just a nobody with a measly twenty-four strands of ungraded magic power, no backing, and mediocre medical skills. He survived on his looks, relying on charm rather than ability. Tang Song had long despised him and saw no issue with provoking him.

But today, Wang Chan had somehow grown a spine, tearing into him without warning—and in front of everyone, no less. If Tang Song didn’t retaliate, he’d never be able to show his face here again.

Wang Chan, however, simply stared coldly at Tang Song’s hand and said in a low voice, 

"There are rules in this trade. You broke them, so I smashed your stall. That’s justice—even the patrol guards wouldn’t argue. And since private duels are forbidden in the market, if you’ve got a problem, we can sign a death contract and take it to the arena."

For some reason, Tang Song hesitated at Wang Chan’s calm demeanor. A duel in the arena meant a fight to the death. Even if he killed Wang Chan, he’d likely suffer heavy losses. It wasn’t worth it.

"Hmph!" 

With a flick of his sleeve, Tang Song stormed off under some flimsy pretext.

The onlookers exchanged bewildered glances. The usually mild-mannered Wang Chan had just shown an unexpectedly fierce side.

Wang Chan watched Tang Song leave with icy detachment.

As the saying went: *Strike first to prevent a hundred blows.*

For minor issues, he could afford to be lenient—keeping the peace was good for business. But if someone messed with his livelihood, he wouldn’t hesitate to strike back, no questions asked.

Especially someone like Tang Song. They were both from Lotus Mountain, yet Tang Song had never shown any courtesy. The original owner of this body had observed him for years. 

While Tang Song’s medical skills might be passable, his combat ability was no match for one or two fully unlocked **[Minor Withering-Blooming Needles]**.

*What a coward. It would’ve been better if he’d agreed to the arena—I could’ve turned him into a pincushion and ended this for good.* Wang Chan sighed inwardly. *Looks like I’ll have to ambush him on the way back to Lotus Mountain instead.*

He wasn’t naive enough to think two enemies could reconcile after such a confrontation. Rather than constantly watching his back, it was better to strike first and eliminate the threat before it grew.

Having made up his mind, Wang Chan ignored the curious stares and returned to his stall. He opened the door to his hut and said to the wide-eyed female cultivator, "Please go inside and prepare. I’ll join you shortly."
