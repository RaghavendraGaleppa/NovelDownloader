# Chapter 48: The End of the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi!

Inside the pavilion.

"This string of prayer beads is a treasure of the Arhat Hall's chief abbot. When separated, there are one hundred and eight beads," the Buddhist disciple spoke. "I ask everyone to scatter them in various directions outside Xuanling Prefecture, with no more than thirty li between each."

He continued, "Within thirty li, the beads will connect through their qi, forming a radiant Buddhist array that will envelop Xuanling Prefecture. If the Venom King Xin Xuan attempts to flee, he will inevitably trigger the Buddhist light, allowing me to detect him."

Pausing briefly, he added, "After this matter is resolved, you may retrieve the beads as my token of gratitude."

"Such a grand setup?" Jia Shifang gasped. "Back then, I asked my master for this string of beads for protection. He said the Jia family would have to build ten more temples first—I thought it was too expensive and gave up. Now, senior brother, you're willing to scatter these beads and give them to us?"

"What does this have to do with you?" The Vajra Temple disciple clasped his hands together. "You belong to the Arhat Hall of the Vajra Temple. When your senior brother asks you to do something, what right do you have to demand rewards? These are for the three of them..."

"This thing is worth ten temples?" The wall-clinging bird fluttered closer, clicking its beak. "To form an array that can cover the entire Xuanling Prefecture—its power must be immense. And you're really giving it to us?"

"Monks do not speak falsehoods," the Vajra Temple disciple replied, clasping his hands. "Earlier, I did not ask the three of you to leave, nor do I fear telling you this: the person behind the Venom King Xin Xuan is no ordinary figure! This time, I hope you will assist to the best of your abilities. Aside from these beads, consider this a personal favor owed to you..."

"A favor?" Upon hearing this, the Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches. "Little monk, let's talk about something more tangible..."

"Hmm..." The Vajra Temple disciple fell silent for a moment before replying, "I truly possess nothing else of value to offer! However, when I pass into nirvana in the future, I will likely leave behind many relics. At that time, each of you may take one."

"And when will you pass into nirvana?" the wall-clinging bird couldn't help but ask.

"At my current cultivation level, I estimate I have about a hundred years left," the Vajra Temple disciple mused. "If I attain the Golden Body, perhaps another five or six hundred..."

"By then, we'll be long dead, and you still won't be!" the wall-clinging bird exclaimed.

"What kind of talk is that? I'll still be around..." The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches. "When you and the master pass away, I'll claim your shares of the relics too."

Two dull thuds sounded in succession.

The wall-clinging bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree were both kicked out of the pavilion.

Li Zhengjing retracted his foot and turned to the Vajra Temple disciple. "I won't trouble myself with the relics from your future nirvana. Instead, I ask for your insight..."

The Vajra Temple disciple nodded. "Speak freely, friend. If I know the answer, I will certainly share it."

"That young master of the Kunlun Sect—his qi is incredibly sharp. Could he be cultivating the legendary Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi?"

"Your discernment is keen!" the Vajra Temple disciple replied. "Since you recognize the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi, you must also know that this so-called supreme sword art of the Kunlun Immortal Sect is inauspicious. All who practiced it met untimely deaths, and it was eventually sealed away."

Li Zhengjing nodded. "I am aware."

The Vajra Temple disciple sighed. "But this young master of the Kunlun Sect was once proud and unrivaled in his youth. Believing he could master this sword art, he ignored the warnings of his elders and insisted on cultivating it."

"Through his extraordinary talent and the aid of the Kunlun Sect's Dragon-Tiger Mystic Elixir, he became the only person in over a thousand years to successfully practice the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi."

"With this sword art, he also became the youngest cultivator in three hundred years to reach the 'True Qi' realm."

"Within three years, he unlocked all his meridians, reaching the peak of the True Qi realm. With the sheer sharpness of his sword qi, he became invincible among all True Qi cultivators!"

At this point, the disciple couldn't help but express admiration. "Once one attains the Dao and becomes an Earthly Immortal, they transcend the mortal realm. Thus, the young master was hailed as the world's foremost, unrivaled in the mortal world."

Li Zhengjing frowned. "Earlier, I overheard your conversation with the young master. After twenty years of cultivation, it seems he is no longer as formidable as before?"

The disciple nodded. "Twenty years ago, the young master of Kunlun was a peerless genius. But in the end, he could not fully subdue the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi. Over the years, he has suffered greatly from its backlash, and even now, he has yet to attain Earthly Immortality."

"Why is that?" Li Zhengjing pondered. "He reached the peak of the True Qi realm without being consumed by the sword qi. Shouldn't he have stabilized by now?"

"You are young and unaware of the truth. Twenty years ago, the young master's True Qi had already reached its peak. To ascend to Earthly Immortality, he needed to refine his Three Hun and Seven Po souls into a Yin Spirit using his True Qi."

The disciple explained, "Then, he would fuse his Yin Spirit with his True Qi, condensing it into mana that would gather in his dantian, forming the so-called 'Golden Soup and Jade Nectar.'"

"But his True Qi had already been refined into the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi—far too sharp and fierce. Attempting to fuse his Yin Spirit with such sword qi would inevitably damage his soul, possibly even scattering it to the winds."

"At that point, his body, devoid of a soul, would be torn apart by the rampant sword qi, riddled with wounds—just like his predecessors—dying an unnatural death."

"Thus, for the past twenty years, with the help of the Kunlun Sect's current sect master, he has been forced to dull his own edge, dispersing the sword qi's sharpness and cultivating a calmer temperament."

"As a result, the unparalleled prowess derived from the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi has gradually weakened."

The disciple sighed. "Truthfully, even with the Kunlun Sect Master's assistance, there is no guarantee he can fully temper the sword qi's sharpness. But if he succeeds, the world will gain another Earthly Immortal."

Hearing this, Li Zhengjing finally understood why he could sense the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi from the Kunlun young master, while the latter, despite his higher mastery, remained oblivious to Li Zhengjing's own sword qi.

He had long suspected that using the Sword Nurturing Art to conceal the sword qi within the 36,500 muscle fibers of his left arm, combined with the Mystic Light Talisman, was insufficient to fully mask its sharpness.

But the Kunlun young master had actively dulled his own sword qi, losing both its edge and his sensitivity to the same qi in others.

"If he succeeds, the world may gain another Earthly Immortal," Li Zhengjing murmured. "But alas, it will have lost a Sword Immortal."

Upon returning to the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, he had consulted the archives.

The Kunlun Sect's Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign was the last true immortal in history to ascend in a blaze of glory—and the last Sword Immortal.

Since the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign, no Sword Immortal has walked the earth.

"Twenty years ago, the young master was regarded as the most likely candidate in three thousand years to become a Sword Immortal," the disciple lamented. "But in the end, he was no Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign. If he does not dull the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi's sharpness, he will never transcend mortality and attain Earthly Immortality."

Li Zhengjing's heart grew heavier.

He, too, practiced the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi—and had begun cultivating it even earlier, during the Inner Qi stage.

Even the Kunlun young master, with the aid of the sect master and the legendary Dragon-Tiger Mystic Elixir, and despite his unparalleled genius, could not truly subdue the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi.

It seemed only the Eternal Verdant Sacred Body could fully master this peerless sword art.

The Thousand Illusions Divine Lord believed Li Zhengjing possessed the Eternal Verdant Sacred Body.

But Li Zhengjing knew the truth—he was not.

"If even the Kunlun young master has fallen to such a state, what fate awaits me?" he wondered.

His gaze fell upon the golden page's divination, and his heart settled slightly.

With enough spirit stones, the golden page would surely reveal a complete method to alter his fate.

He exhaled slowly. "I must find a way to earn more spirit stones."

With that thought, his eyes drifted toward Jia Shifang in the pavilion—as if spotting a perfect mark.
