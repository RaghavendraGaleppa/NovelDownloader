# Chapter 44: The Branch

At the bottom of the pond, Hu Le'er was severely injured but remained fully conscious. The changes in her surroundings couldn't escape her spiritual senses—she knew she had no choice left.

She took out the heart-fur given by Da Yuan, infused it with a message, then channeled her remaining magic power into it. To her surprise, the heart-fur ignited even underwater, burning away completely without leaving even ashes behind.

Immediately after, Hu Le'er dismantled her defensive formation and slowly floated upward, hovering just above the lake's surface.

As she emerged, over a hundred cultivators emerged from the surrounding forest, taking to the skies and forming an impenetrable blockade thousands of meters in the air, cutting off all escape routes.

The cultivators loomed over Hu Le'er like a dark stormcloud. One of the senior cultivators surrounding her spoke up:

"Miss Hu, we cultivators seek only wealth, not your life. We have no intention of provoking the wrath of [Peach Blossom Mountain]."

"If you surrender all your valuables, we will spare your life."

Even at this critical moment, they still sought to break her will with words.

All they received in response was a scornful laugh.

"Ha! What a joke! You worthless trash think you can make Hu Le'er submit?"

She then produced the third-grade artifact [Pure Sun Lantern] she had acquired at the auction and said:

"The merchant guild's dogs must have tampered with this lantern, allowing you to track me all this way, didn't they?"

"One day I'll drag that pig Xu Yuan out of his coffin shell and feed his roasted flesh to the wolves!"

The cultivator responded:

"What's the point of bravado now, young lady? For us cultivators, the path to immortality is long—preserving one's life should be the first priority!"

"Hahaha, ridiculous!"

"If preserving life is so important, how dare you provoke the successor of a Great Sage? You well-dwelling frogs are only fit to be Xu Yuan's pathfinding dogs!"

Hu Le'er's words dripped with contempt for those surrounding her.

"My elder always said I was too greedy, that excess is worse than deficiency! But I never listened!"

"I thought this [Pure Sun Lantern] looked beautiful, perfect for decorating my cave abode. My greed made me buy it, only to fall into your trap!"

"The elder was right after all!"

"You cultivators helping me temper my resolve—consider it a worthy death!"

Ignoring their reactions, Hu Le'er produced a small, ordinary-looking branch with a single peach blossom at its tip.

As she channeled her remaining magic power into it, an overwhelming aura began swelling from the branch.

**The Longevity Treasure: [Peach God Branch]!**

The surrounding cultivators sensed something amiss and immediately attacked.

In an instant, countless divine abilities, spells, and magical artifacts rained down upon Hu Le'er.

A hundred second-tier cultivators attacking simultaneously created a maelstrom of energy so violent it darkened the sky and shook the earth.

Yet all these attacks dissipated upon entering a ten-meter radius around Hu Le'er, their power nullified completely. Even magical artifacts were ground to dust.

A green light emanated from the branch, forming an impenetrable barrier around Hu Le'er.

No matter how fiercely the cultivators attacked, the barrier remained unscathed.

Within the light, Hu Le'er stood calmly, utterly indifferent to the chaos around her. She spoke:

"You pathetic trash—not a single disciple from a major sect among you. What could you possibly know of true immortality? Have you ever witnessed the power of a Great Sage?"

"Before your deaths, you'll glimpse the truth of longevity and the might of a Great Sage. Consider yourselves fortunate to die enlightened."

The green light surrounding Hu Le'er rapidly expanded, gradually taking the form of a massive peach tree.

The tree's silhouette stretched endlessly, soon becoming large enough to blot out the sky.

This was the divine power of a longevity demon—a supreme magical ability!

At this moment, the peach tree's radiance rivaled the sun and moon, its height challenging the heavens themselves.

From a distance, the colossal tree stood over thirty kilometers tall, piercing through all cloud layers.

The sudden appearance of such a massive entity displaced vast amounts of air and matter, creating hurricane-force winds and triggering landslides.

Amid the roaring tempest, countless lives perished—a once-thriving jungle transformed into a lifeless wasteland in moments.

Under the crushing weight of this divine power, a massive crater formed, its floor compressed to steel-like hardness.

The human cultivators had long since been obliterated during the tree's expansion, their bodies and souls reduced to the finest dust.

In this single attack, over two hundred second-tier cultivators were erased from existence—more than ten percent of the entire Gui Province's mid-level cultivation forces wiped out.

Hu Le'er stood at the center of the colossal peach tree's radiance, holding the [Peach God Branch].

Compared to the sky-obscuring tree, she appeared no larger than a speck of dust—yet she was the core of this overwhelming power.

With eyes closed, she carefully absorbed the essence of this longevity power.

---

The Peach God's magic had already healed all her injuries and further purified her cultivation, effectively opening the gate to the third tier for her.

Within the peach tree's radiance, Hu Le'er was steadily advancing.

Though using the [Peach God Branch] merely to eliminate two hundred second-tier cultivators was an enormous waste, breaking through to the third tier represented a crucial step on the path to longevity.

At this stage, a demon's lifespan would multiply several times over compared to human cultivators of the same tier, with a corresponding surge in power.

As Hu Le'er advanced, her human form gradually faded, transforming into a small white fox.

During this metamorphosis, two additional tails sprouted, making her a three-tailed white fox.

With this physical evolution, a new innate divine ability took root in Hu Le'er's consciousness, rapidly growing as it absorbed her magic power.

Her breakthrough complete, another third-tier great demon fox had entered the world.

As Hu Le'er focused inward to examine her new ability, a delicate jade-white hand suddenly reached from behind, grabbing the little fox by the scruff and pulling her into an embrace.

Every hair on Hu Le'er's body stood on end—her limbs froze, her mind reeled in shock.

Never could she have imagined someone capable of penetrating fourth-tier Peach God power to casually scoop up a third-tier great demon like a pet!

The jade hand gently stroked the white fox's back.

Looking up, Hu Le'er saw a stunning young woman in palace attire, her hair elegantly coiled, her bright eyes and white teeth forming a faint smile as she gazed down.
