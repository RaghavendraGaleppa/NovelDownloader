# Chapter 366: Nightmare, Memories of the Dead Attack (1/2)

Since that New Year, Qinghe County has sold more firecrackers than any other county every year, because the town says the Ying family was attacked by the Nian Beast.

Some adults use the threat, "If you don't behave, the Nian Beast will come and eat you," to scare children.

Zou Yongfeng was clearly one of those scared children. He glanced around and lowered his voice.

"A few months ago, I passed by the Ying family's old house and saw a huge, huge black shadow."

"It looked a bit like the Nian Beast the adults used to scare us with. Seeing that the New Year was approaching, my family quickly moved away."

"The Nian Beast?"

Li Mo frowned. He felt the small hand in his palm growing colder and colder. He gently rubbed it, but couldn't warm it up.

The cold sent a shiver through Li Mo.

He glanced sideways, but found that Ying Bing's gaze was unfocused, her beautiful face devoid of any color.

Distant memories suddenly began to attack Li Mo.

It was Little Ice Cube.

When she first came to the Li Mansion as a child, she would lock herself in her room all day, only coming out occasionally to eat. If she heard a loud noise, a hint of fear would appear in her eyes. Her expression back then was exactly like it was now.

Not just cold, but also a bit hollow.

During that time, the Li Mansion was unusually cold, even the snow melted later than other houses.

"Ice Cube, let's go home."

"Okay..."

Li Mo bid farewell to Zou Yongfeng and the family with a smile, saying he would come back to drink at their child's full-month celebration. Then he turned and walked home with Ice Cube.

Looking back, he saw a lifeless ruin by the riverbank of Qinghe, cold and desolate, completely out of place with the New Year.

...

As soon as they got home, Ying Bing went to her room after dinner and didn't come out again. Although she told Li Mo softly that she was fine and just needed to rest for a bit, Li Mo couldn't help but fall into deep thought while eating.

What exactly happened to the Ying family back then?

She was silent, and he wasn't much of a talker either.

This scene made Gu Xueqin a bit strange.

"Son, what's wrong with you two?"

Li Mo shook his head. "It's nothing. We ran into Yongfeng when we went out today."

"Did he say he saw something at the Ying family's old house?" Li Dalong spoke up.

"You know about it, Dad?"

"What do you think your dad does? He came to the county office to report it that day, smelling of alcohol. He was probably drunk."

Li Dalong said impatiently, "That guy Yongfeng was acting like a madman. I took people to check it out. There wasn't even a ghost there."

Was Yongfeng just seeing things because he was drunk? But that wouldn't be enough to make them move...

Actually, Li Mo had already used his Destiny Divine Eye in the afternoon. There was nothing unusual in Yongfeng's recent experiences.

He didn't ask his father if he saw anything that day. His dad had mentioned it a few times over tea at home, and besides, by the time he took people to check, it was too late.

The one who truly saw everything was Ice Cube.

Li Mo looked up at the room opposite. Tonight, there was not only no candlelight, but not even a glimmer of light.

Ice Cube wasn't cultivating?

...

Midnight.

In the pitch-black wing, the door quietly opened.

A certain little Li, who had been sneaking around for days, quietly entered the room.

As soon as he entered, he saw Ying Bing lying on the bed. Her sleeping face was not peaceful; her delicate brows were tightly furrowed.

Fine sweat beaded on her forehead, strands of hair sticking to her snow-white neck.

She... was having a nightmare?

Destiny Divine Eye, activate.

【Name: Ying Bing】
【Age: 17】
【Constitution: Taiyin Moon Phoenix Body.】
【Cultivation: Five Apertures of Divine Observation.】
【Destiny: Red (Bearing the Emperor Bone, Ice as Fate, Autumn Water as Spirit, has the appearance of a Heavenly Phoenix)】
【Evaluation: Fate is full of tribulations, but she can always turn misfortune into fortune. Her feathers are not yet full, but when the winds and clouds change, she will surely hang high in the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, a Phoenix ruling the Eight Wastelands and Six Directions.】
【Recent Experience: Plagued by nightmares.】

Li Mo tried to release the Taiyin Clear Radiance, a moonlight that could calm the mind, but it couldn't soothe the girl's furrowed brows.

"What to do."

---

Little Li Genius frowned, then suddenly thought of the second layer of the Phoenix's Cry over the Heavenly Marsh, where spirits unite and minds merge.

Ice Cube had used this method to help him break through before.

What if he used it now?

Could he enter Ice Cube's dream?

But this also meant that they would have to bear the nightmare together. If Ice Cube couldn't wake up, he would be the same...

"All karma, life and death are intertwined..."

Li Mo muttered to himself and held her cold, small hand.

Phoenix's Cry over the Heavenly Marsh, activate!

The next moment, he fell asleep in an instant, tumbling right into Ice Cube's embrace. But he had no mind to enjoy the softness and fragrance; he had already started breathing evenly.

Li Mo's consciousness cleared. He smelled the scent of firecracker smoke in the air.

He opened his eyes and looked around, slightly stunned.

A spacious ancestral hall. From the hall, looking down the green stone steps, he could see the clear river flowing noisily, with many people coming and going.

But the sky seemed to be drifting with ash, making everything appear covered in a layer of gray, snowy static.

This was a place that had long been burned to the ground and no longer existed—the Ying family manor's ancestral hall.

"Little one, who are you?" the gatekeeper asked.

"I am..."

Li Mo looked at his own small, tender hands and muttered.

"I am Li Mo, the son of County Lieutenant Li..."

"And what are you here for?"

"I'm here... I'm here to find... find Ice Cube... find Ying Bing!"

The confusion in Li Mo's eyes vanished; he remembered everything!

The gatekeeper didn't think much of it, assuming it was just the County Lieutenant's son coming to find a playmate for the New Year.

"Go on in then. I don't know where Miss Ice is, you can look for her yourself."

"Thank you, sir."

Little Li nodded obediently and entered the Ying family's ancestral hall.

To have a manor by the city outskirts all to oneself showed this was a prominent family, and the ancestral hall was quite magnificent.

At the moment, a banquet was set up in front of the hall. People were drinking and chatting, creating a lively atmosphere. Unfortunately, everything was grayish, adding a touch of emptiness to the liveliness.

Li Mo scanned the crowd with his eyes but couldn't find Little Ice Cube.

Instead, he saw a couple at the head table, chatting with the people beside them.

"Uncle Ying, Auntie, Happy New Year," Li Mo went up to greet them.

These were Ying Bing's parents.

"Is that Brother Li's child?"

Ying Xuliang lowered his gaze and smiled, pulling a red envelope from his pocket.

"Happy New Year. How are Brother Li and his wife?"

"They're both at home. I came to play with Sister Bing," Li Mo said in a clear, charming voice.

Beside Ying Xuliang, a woman with features as beautiful as a painting said:

"Bing'er is sick. Next time, when she's better, Auntie will bring her to visit."

It seemed that it was in this year that Ice Cube's体质 (constitution) first showed its signs, making her endure the torture of extreme cold every day.

Li Mo thought for a moment and said:

"Then I'll just go in and see Sister Bing, okay? I promise I won't disturb her."

An old scholar-like man beside them immediately said impatiently:

"You... you little troublemaker, you're definitely up to no good again, aren't you?"

"?"

Li Mo was stunned. He saw who had spoken.

This tutor... just a 'few days' ago during his afternoon nap, his face was covered in tally marks...

He never expected that the memories of the dead could attack him like this.
