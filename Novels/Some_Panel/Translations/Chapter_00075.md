# Chapter 74: Such a Dao Sect

The purple-robed man led the way, with Yang Ji and the 283 others following closely behind.

They soared through clouds and mists, the scenery changing with extreme speed. In just a few dozen breaths, they had already flown hundreds of li forward.

The next moment, the purple-robed man suddenly stopped ahead, remarking calmly, "Ahead is our Immeasurable Dao Sect!"

Upon hearing this, everyone parted the clouds and mist before them to gaze forward.

The scene that met their eyes greatly astonished them.

In the heavens, immortal palaces were densely clustered, countless floating peaks dotted the sky. Myriad golden lights rolled like crimson rainbows, and a thousand threads of auspicious energy spouted purple mist—truly an immortal realm in the heavens.

On the ground, immortal mountains stretched endlessly, rare treasures were everywhere. Immortal spirit flowers that never withered for a thousand years, immortal ascension grasses that stayed evergreen for ten thousand years—truly a blessed land on earth.

Above and below, spirit energy swirled, thick as smoke when gathered, yet light as rain when scattered.

It formed into clouds in vast expanses and into mist in delicate wisps, floating in the sky and drifting among the mountains. Spirit beasts hid within, hooves pounding through forests, cranes calling, phoenixes singing.

Waterfalls cascaded down from the floating peaks, resembling roaring jade dragons, involuntarily bringing to mind the magnificent scene of "a flying stream descends three thousand feet, as if the Milky Way has fallen from the Ninth Heaven."

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew, lifting the lower section of a waterfall high into the air, shattering it into countless jade beads that sprayed in all directions. Under the sunlight, they refracted into vibrant rainbows, stretching across the sky, dazzling to the eye.

The jade beads struck the cliffs, splashing like jade liquid and shattering like emerald. The splashing water formed large sprays of mist, resembling white, ethereal smoke and thin clouds, brushing through forests like dense rain, and floating along paths like wisps of smoke.

The floating peaks and immortal mountains, the auspicious glow and purple energy, the arching rainbows, the spirit energy like mist—all intertwined to portray a perfect vision of an immortal blessed land.

An immortal blessed land that stretched for tens of thousands of li, seemingly without end.

Yang Ji gazed at it, his mind stunned by the immortal scenery. It wasn't until a crane's cry rang out that he trembled and snapped back to reality.

Upon careful reflection, he broke out in a cold sweat. Within this scenery, an infinite Dao Charm was concealed, so captivating that it nearly disrupted his mind.

It lured people into the scenery and captivated their spirits.

Yang Ji, a man sworn to become an immortal, how could he be captivated by mere Dao Charm and lose himself?

The Thousand Islands Sea Region was a world of fire sources, but the Immeasurable Dao Sect was not Yang Ji's final destination. His journey would not stop here.

One day, he would stand upon an immortal palace, watching flowers bloom and fade at the foot of mountains, and clouds unfurl and furl in the sky.

The Dao Sect was merely a temporary stop; the immortal realm was his true destination.

Yang Ji made a grand ambition in his heart. His ambition soared higher than the heavens, bolstered by his will to become an immortal, his aura naturally surged. He would not be intimidated by the mere grandeur of this Dao Sect.

Truly, as vast as one's heart, so vast is their world. Yang Ji's ambition and aspirations burst forth at this moment.

As long as he held this grand ambition in his heart and strived tirelessly towards it, his mind would grow increasingly powerful.

Yang Ji's aura was like a rainbow. He took a step forward, the fire in his eyes burned brighter, and his conviction grew even firmer.

At this moment, that captivating Dao Charm instantly vanished. In his eyes, there was only the beautiful immortal blessed land before him, akin to a paradise.

Just as he was calmly admiring the beautiful scenery.

Suddenly, beside him, the athletic young woman subtly shivered and, likewise, broke free from the Dao Charm's hold.

But before she could even be pleased, she saw Yang Ji grin at her from the side. "You're awake?"

"Huh?"

The athletic young woman was utterly astonished, exclaiming "Impossible!" in her heart.

"How could *he*, a pampered 'young master' from a sect, wake up before me? Is his willpower and temperament stronger than mine?"

"How could this fellow, who needed constant warnings and escorts, break free from the Dao Charm's hold before me?"

The young woman found this fact hard to accept. Her pretty brows were slightly furrowed with surprise as she scrutinized Yang Ji, wanting to see through him completely.

Yang Ji naturally knew what she was thinking. His grin widened, and the smile on his face grew even more pronounced.

The athletic young woman frowned in dissatisfaction, then averted her gaze.

"Senior Brother Wang, how are the aptitudes of this batch?" At this moment, a man flew towards them. He was also clad in purple robes, a handsome and graceful man, possessing the demeanor of a great sect.

"What else can I say? You've seen it yourself." The purple-robed man glanced at Yang Ji and the athletic young woman, who were the first to recover, a look of deep approval in his eyes.

But seeing that the others were still lost in the trance, the purple-robed man shook his head and let out a low roar that shook their souls: "Wake up!"

"Hmm?"

Everyone's bodies subtly trembled, and they abruptly awakened, fine beads of sweat covering their foreheads. Clearly, they had been significantly affected by the Dao Charm.

"This is Steward Qin. You may call him Senior Brother Qin. He will take you to your living quarters." The purple-robed man turned and addressed the crowd.

"Senior Brother Qin!" everyone called out.

"Alright, follow me." Steward Qin nodded to the purple-robed man, then led Yang Ji and the others towards the immortal mountains below.

"Senior Brother Qin, who resides in those immortal palaces in the sky?" During the flight, someone noticed divine rainbows constantly traveling within the immortal palaces and asked curiously.

"Those are the residences of True Disciples. This heavenly domain outside is called the Everlasting Heaven Domain, encompassing a radius of eight hundred li. All the immortal palaces and floating peaks within it are the territory of the Everlasting True Disciples," Steward Qin explained.

"What? All the immortal palaces and floating peaks within this eight-hundred-li heaven domain belong to one True Disciple of Everlasting?" Everyone was astonished. These seemingly endless immortal palaces and floating peaks, as far as the eye could see, belonged to a single person? And he was merely a True Disciple.

As if sensing their thoughts, Steward Qin smiled:

"The power of a Dao Sect True Disciple is beyond your imagination. They are the geniuses among geniuses, seeds for the Grand Ascension realm. Such individuals surpass ordinary people in both mental fortitude and strength. They single-handedly govern a heaven domain, establish their forces, and maneuver strategically. Within their heaven domain, they are the heavens themselves, possessing immense authority."

Steward Qin looked upwards, a hint of envy in his eyes.

"True Disciples have such great authority, what about Dao Children?" Someone took a deep breath and asked again.

"Dao Children? They are seeds for True Immortals. They possess their own small worlds and are heaven-blessed prodigies who gather immense luck, great perseverance, and profound wisdom. Their authority is second only to the Sect Master."

Steward Qin wasn't impatient when asked these questions. Instead, he answered with great enthusiasm, suggesting that he, too, harbored such aspirations in his heart.

"Dao Children are that formidable?" Everyone was amazed.

"Naturally, they are formidable! For now, you can only look up to Dao Children and True Disciples. Even the Inner Disciples, who possess immortal mountains, are beyond your current reach."

"You aren't even considered formal disciples yet. Only after passing the first assessment can you be barely counted as a disciple, and even then, you face the risk of failing the next assessment at any time. You must settle your minds well," Steward Qin advised.

Everyone nodded, their restless hearts gradually calming down.

Their primary concern now was how to pass the three assessments and remain in the Dao Sect permanently. That was the crucial first step.

The group flew for over ten li along the immortal mountains, where the terrain gradually widened into a large plain.

Many buildings had been constructed on the plain.

Steward Qin pointed and said:

"Do you see the continuous expanse of palaces below? Those are your temporary residences. The rooms twinkling with spiritual light mean they are unoccupied. The Dao Sect Talisman in your hands is the key to entry. You may find an empty room and move in yourselves."

Steward Qin added, "Once you enter a room, there's a detection array on the floor. This array will detect your cultivation realm. Your first assessment task will then be assigned based on your strength."

"Golden Core realm corresponds to Golden Core tasks, Nascent Soul realm corresponds to Nascent Soul tasks."

"Don't even think about using treasures or other means to hide your cultivation. Even if you manage to fool the detection array, in the end, an elder will personally verify it. If anyone among you is found to have hidden their cultivation, they will be executed on the spot."

Upon hearing this, everyone's expressions turned solemn, and they put away any mischievous thoughts.

The Immeasurable Dao Sect had strict laws; this was not like their previous sects where they could act recklessly.

"The detection array inside the palace rooms is also activated by the Dao Sect Talisman. Before activating it, input your identity information into the Dao Sect Talisman. Afterward, task notifications will be delivered to you via the talisman. During this period, you may simply wait patiently," Steward Qin said sternly.

"Thank you, Senior Brother, for informing us. We understand," everyone nodded.

"Good. Then, you may go down and find a room for yourselves. I still need to greet the next batch of disciples coming to the Dao Sect." With that, Steward Qin turned and flew back.

Everyone watched Steward Qin's departing back, then looked down at the continuous expanse of palaces below.

They stretched as far as the eye could see, all built grandly and magnificently, glowing brilliantly, predominantly royal yellow in color, resembling imperial palaces.

Yang Ji instantly recognized several high-grade materials used in these palaces: crimson-yellow stone, Vajra wood, Spirit Fragrance wood...

Inside, several arrays were integrated: spirit-gathering arrays, spatial restrictions, and detection arrays.

What surprised Yang Ji slightly was that each palace was actually a low-grade spirit artifact.

Truly worthy of being the Dao Sect! To have such palaces as residences even before becoming a formal disciple was an act of great generosity and grandeur.

Just these seemingly endless palaces alone must be worth an immense amount of spirit stones. Yang Ji truly felt the strength of the Dao Sect at this moment.

Worthy of being a super sect with Tribulation Immortals. Only a sect with such profound heritage could nurture true immortals.

Yang Ji couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement, growing even more eager to remain in the Dao Sect.

After recalling his wandering thoughts, Yang Ji looked around and flew towards a palace on the side.

The athletic young woman watched his retreating figure, furrowed her delicate brows, and after some thought, followed him, landing in the palace next to his.

Yang Ji smiled at her, chose an unoccupied room, and then pressed the talisman in his hand onto the glowing stone door. A suction force arose, drawing him inside.

"This fellow from a greenhouse, his willpower absolutely cannot be stronger than mine!"

The young woman frowned, still bothered, looking at the spot where Yang Ji had disappeared. She was unwilling to believe it.

She paused for two breaths, then, like Yang Ji, took out her talisman and entered the palace.

As soon as Yang Ji entered, he saw a circular array pattern, one zhang in diameter, on the white jade floor.

It was currently dim; this was the "Detection Array."

He glanced at it, then surveyed the room.

The room wasn't large, likely a sealed cultivation chamber. For one person, it felt quite spacious.

Other than a cushion for meditation, there were no other furnishings, making it incredibly simple.

However, Yang Ji also noticed a floating ball of spiritual light in the room, which surprisingly contained two books.

He reached out and grabbed them; the books fell into his hands.

These two books were, unexpectedly, about the Immeasurable Dao Sect and various common knowledge about the immortal cultivation world.

One was titled *The Immeasurable Dao Sect*, and the other, *The Immortal Cultivation World*.

These two books were likely intentionally placed in the rooms by the Dao Sect, and other rooms should also have them.

Yang Ji instantly grew interested. He took the meditation cushion and sat cross-legged within the detection array.

He began flipping through the books while simultaneously pressing his Dao Sect Talisman into the slot of the detection array.

Before coming to the Dao Sect, his personal information had already been inputted into the talisman, so he just needed to press it now.

As the talisman embedded into the array, the detection array patterns lit up.

At the same time, the spirit-gathering array also activated, and spirit energy instantly gathered. The room quickly transformed into an excellent cultivation spot.

Yang Ji allowed the spiritual light surging from the array to detect his cultivation realm, remaining undisturbed as he read his books.

After reading for a while, he gained a general understanding of the Immeasurable Dao Sect's structure.

Foundation Establishment cultivators were merely Servant Disciples. Golden Core cultivators were Outer Disciples. Nascent Soul True Monarchs were Inner Disciples.

As for True Disciples, their status depended not only on their realm but also on their potential. Only genius disciples at the Soul Transformation realm could become True Disciples.

Those whose talent wasn't particularly outstanding but who had reached the Soul Transformation realm would become Stewards.

Yang Ji understood this now. The purple-robed man and Senior Brother Qin, whom they had encountered earlier, must hold such steward positions.

Disciples of their type, whose talent and potential were insufficient to become True Disciples, could still become Outer Elders if they cultivated diligently and reached the Void Refinement realm. If they were fortunate enough to break through to the Integration Realm, they would become Inner Elders.

This was their path to promotion.

As for genius disciples also in the Soul Transformation realm, they could become True Disciples after passing the sect's loyalty assessment.

Such individuals were qualified to cultivate the most profound cultivation techniques and divine abilities within the sect, further strengthening their foundation.

If they performed exceptionally during this period, defying common sense, they would become Dao Children once their cultivation broke through to the Void Refinement realm.

Dao Children would be cultivated with the sect's full power. These disciples were qualified to cultivate ninety percent of the sect's cultivation techniques and spells.

Once they broke through to the Integration Realm, they would have the right to cultivate all cultivation techniques and spells within the sect except for immortal arts, enjoying authority second only to the Sect Master.

If they reached the Grand Ascension realm, they would be qualified to compete for the position of Sect Master and could cultivate all immortal arts.

It could be said that every promotion, from Outer Disciple to Dao Child, was extremely difficult, yet each was an opportunity. If one could seize it, their path to immortality would be smooth sailing.

As for Yang Ji's current status, he wasn't even considered an Outer Disciple yet.

However, based on his current strength, he would become an Outer Disciple after passing just one assessment.

But he wouldn't be completely safe yet. Only by truly passing all three assessments could he become a true disciple of the Dao Sect, able to remain in the sect forever and enjoy its benefits.

The Dao Sect used assessments to filter out unqualified disciples. Those who truly remained were the elite of the elite, the genius of geniuses.

The Dao Sect had over a million disciples, truly teeming with talent, yet there were only a thousand True Disciples.

Yang Ji knew the road ahead would be difficult.

But, it was full of hope!
