# Chapter 78: Re-entering the Witch-Ghost Realm

One month later, Skeleton Mountain.

Lu Yang sped along on his escape light, unhindered. After all, with his current strength, ordinary Qi Refining Grand Perfection cultivators were no longer worth his notice. Even though he now only had a Yin God formed from his soul, with its higher tier of power, dealing with a Qi Refining Grand Perfection cultivator was merely a flick of his sleeve. Only if the opponent, like Yun Miaozhen from before, possessed a Great Divine Ability or a wondrous treasure, would they stand a chance against Lu Yang.

Of course, this only applied to bullying weaker opponents. After losing his physical body, Lu Yang's state was actually at its lowest point. If he encountered a cultivator of the same tier, he would have no choice but to flee.

Soon, Lu Yang halted his escape light. In the distance, a black mountain range with soaring yin energy entered his sight.

"Good, it seems True Master Yin Mountain hasn't arrived yet."

Lu Yang sensed the karmic threads, confirming that the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm had not yet appeared and the Divine Might Sect's people had not arrived. Only then did he transform into a gentle breeze and merge into the mountain.

In his previous life, when the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm emerged, Lu Yang had memorized its location, making it easy to find this time. Before long, Lu Yang arrived before a cave. He stepped in; it was initially very narrow, but after walking several dozen steps, it suddenly opened up into a vast underground lake.

"This is the place."

Lu Yang gazed at the lake, sensing a strong spatial fluctuation, but he didn't enter directly. Instead, he lingered around the entrance of the secret realm. Even though things were different now, his Dao heart remained firm. "Haste makes waste, and patience brings peace." No rush, he'd play around with it first.

Lu Yang took out the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner, giving it a gentle shake. Chen Xin'an's figure immediately appeared, and then Lu Yang tossed him into the entrance of the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm. He hadn't forgotten that there was still a Golden Core sword qi inside the secret realm. In his previous life, he hadn't cultivated the Saint Sect's cultivation methods, so he wasn't killed by the sword qi. However, in this life, he had cultivated the Saint Sect's body-refining technique, the Saintly Thief. Under these circumstances, who knew if that sword qi would spare him. Just in case, it was better to let Senior Brother Chen scout ahead first.

Chen Xin'an: "..."

Boom!

The next second, ripples spread across the underground lake before him. Using Chen Xin'an's perspective, Lu Yang quickly saw the scene within. What appeared before his eyes was a magnificent sword qi. However, the sword qi didn't strike. Instead, it remotely locked onto Chen Xin'an, seemingly marking something, and then actually allowed him to enter the secret realm.

"So straightforward?"

Lu Yang looked surprised. He then activated a hand seal, about to retrieve Chen Xin'an.

Clang!

Almost simultaneously, the sword qi, which had previously become dormant, suddenly trembled. Chen Xin'an, who had just intended to leave the secret realm, instantly dispersed into a wisp of white qi.

Upon seeing this, Lu Yang raised an eyebrow. He first checked Chen Xin'an's true spirit within the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner, and only after ensuring he could summon him back after some time did he sigh in relief. He then took out another banner spirit and tossed it into the secret realm. After several trials, he finally reached a conclusion:

"Allowed in, but not out, eh?"

Lu Yang mused, "That's right. The purpose of this sword qi is to eradicate the lineage of the Witch-Ghost Dao, so it won't allow anyone to leave the secret realm. As for why it allows entry... Damn it, this is a trap!"

Thinking this, Lu Yang's eye twitched. "This is clearly using the secret realm as bait, luring demonic cultivators in to search for treasures, and then ambushing and killing them all at once! The righteous path's hearts are too dark!"

Although Lu Yang wasn't sure if his guess was correct, if it were him, he would definitely do this. Judging others by himself, he felt the truth was probably close to that. Thinking of this, Lu Yang became even more cautious. So he patiently waited for several more months until his Primordial Qi Incarnation cultivated into a Martial Dao Heavenly Human again, only then did he send it into the secret realm. This time, he no longer thought about leaving, but instead delved deeper into the secret realm.

Soon, various buildings appeared in Lu Yang's field of vision. Most of them had turned into white bones, with only broken magical artifacts scattered across the ground. Lu Yang looked around. The entire Witch-Ghost Secret Realm, unlike the outside world, had no spiritual energy remaining. There was only an extremely dense Earth Fiend Yin Qi. Ordinary cultivators, without corresponding cultivation methods, couldn't even breathe or cultivate here. Over time, even their physical bodies would be corroded by the yin qi.

"In a place like this, would there be cultivators?"

Lu Yang pondered inwardly, but his movements didn't stop. He looked around with interest; he could already tell that he seemed to be inside a city.

Just then, an extremely suppressed cry suddenly came from not far away:

"Bastard... What are you doing?"

Lu Yang turned his head, only to see a human face peeking out from the corner of the ruins. It roared in a low voice, "Do you not want to live? It's already night!"

Immediately after, the face first showed hesitation and struggle, then gritted its teeth and crawled out of the ruins. It was a boy no older than fourteen or fifteen, who quickly came to Lu Yang's side, grabbed his hand, and roughly tried to pull him away.

Lu Yang seeing this, raised an eyebrow and didn't resist.

However, the next second, the boy's expression suddenly froze. He turned his head, and a look of despair immediately appeared on his rather handsome face:

"I shouldn't have saved you... We're dead... We're all going to die..."

Tap, tap-tap...

Almost simultaneously, footsteps echoed within the desolate ruins. Lu Yang looked in response, seeing an old man dressed in yellow, with dead-set eyes. The old man's eyes were pale grey, his pupils unfocused and dilated, yet they were fixed directly on Lu Yang and the mysterious boy. As his gaze fell upon them, a visible darkness slowly approached the two, carrying a strong stench of decay.

"Yellow-clothed! How could it be yellow-clothed!?"

The boy, following Lu Yang's gaze, also noticed the old man's presence. However, upon seeing the color of the old man's clothes, his face instantly turned pale with horror.

Behind the boy, Lu Yang watched all this with interest. In truth, he hadn't understood a single word the boy in front of him had just said, but this didn't stop him from being interested in the suddenly appearing yellow-clothed old man.

The next second, Lu Yang had already placed his hand on the boy's head. He had no interest in wasting time talking to people and slowly gathering information. As a Saint Sect disciple, directly soul-searching was more to his liking.

"You!?"

The boy had never expected Lu Yang to "repay kindness with enmity." He let out a tragic cry on the spot, and then Lu Yang's spiritual sense directly pierced into his mind.

In no time, a vast amount of information flooded Lu Yang's mind. Language, culture, worldview, and even all information regarding this "Witch-Ghost Secret Realm" were meticulously extracted by Lu Yang in an instant.

A hundred ghosts walking at night, the human world like a prison!

Within the secret realm, sword qi hung overhead, thus no one could truly cultivate. All were mortals. Only by devouring ghosts to offer to Yama could one seek a sliver of hope for survival.

White-clothed ghosts, yellow-clothed ghosts, black-clothed ghosts, red-clothed ghosts...

The Ghost Listener Sect, Ghost Messengers...

Lu Yang processed the massive amount of information one by one, making him exclaim in wonder while also raising doubts: "The secret realm in my previous life wasn't like this."

In his previous life, the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm was almost entirely empty. Even when True Master Yin Mountain destroyed it, not a single living creature was seen. However, in this life, there was clearly life within the secret realm. The cultivators of the former Witch-Ghost Dao had not only survived but had also found an alternative path of cultivation.

"Is it because of that sword qi?"

Recalling the Golden Core sword qi that occupied the secret realm, Lu Yang felt an icy chill in his heart: "Could it be that the sword qi killed them all?"

But on second thought, Lu Yang felt something was off. After all, the Golden Core sword qi had been dormant in the secret realm for so many years. What could possibly happen to make it directly slaughter the entire secret realm in the future?
