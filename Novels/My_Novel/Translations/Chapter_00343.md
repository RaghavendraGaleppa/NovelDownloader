# Chapter 343: The Self Takes Command, the Lady’s Fury, Regret Comes Too Late

Wen Caishang frowned slightly. Although she sensed changes in Li Xianyin, she did not know the details. Seeing Li Xianyin’s Second Realm attainments, facing the oppression of the Five Mountains, he still could not hide his sharpness; his spirit was indeed extraordinary.

Suddenly, a thunderous boom echoed as the five mountains trembled violently. Cracks spread across the mountain bodies before they suddenly collapsed! Mud, sand, and boulders tumbled down, threatening to swallow and bury everything. Li Xianyin and Wen Caishang, standing amidst it, appeared incredibly small, in imminent danger of being buried by the debris in an instant.

Although this strange scene was an illusion, the momentum of the mud and stones pouring down was real. Every rolling grass, tree, stone, and grain of sand were the killing moves of the five elders. In essence, they were sharp swords aimed directly at vital points.

A loud rumbling sound was heard as a giant stone covered in moss and entwined with vines rolled down from the mountain height, crashing down accompanied by countless fine sand and mud, with a momentum of ten thousand pounds! The essence of this illusion was Wang Zongheng’s sweeping giant sword strike and Xiao Wanjian’s rapid sword thrusts.

Combined with the refraction of light and shadow around them, Hou Yuande’s "Illusion Sword" created this strange phenomenon. To onlookers, this killing move would make them want to surrender immediately, not daring to resist, and let themselves be buried and devoured by the mountain flood. Even those with great courage could not see through the mystery, treating it merely as giant stones and mud rolling down. How could they defend against the sword moves hidden beneath the illusion? In the end, it was just futile struggle.

The giant stone was a feint; the killing move was hidden in the fine, scattered sand. Li Xianyin remained calm, ignoring the strange scenes in the sky, and suddenly thrust forward lightly.

The move was extremely ordinary, yet it contained the principles of Yin and Yang and the swordsmanship attainments of the Great Self Realm. Where his sword tip pointed, the mud and sand dissipated, and the overwhelming pressure vanished instantly.

Li Xianyin possessed dual pupils; this illusion could no longer frighten him.

Moreover, with the dual swords combined, using Wen Caishang’s cultivation to execute the sword move, it contained infinite variations. The power was truly indescribable. This simple thrust contained immense martial principles. With a sharp "ding" sound, Li Xianyin pierced into the mud and sand, but sparks flew as his sword tip met another long sword. The extremely powerful sword move Xiao Wanjian hid within the illusion was easily suppressed by Li Xianyin.

Xiao Wanjian, Hu Yueyue, Duan Yixin, Wang Zongheng, and Hou Yuande had practiced their combined sword moves diligently since the duel was set. Combining the strengths of their schools, their sword moves supported each other, layering martial arts effects to create this strange phenomenon. Although they had a premonition that victory would not come easily, they believed they could force Wen Caishang to reveal a move or two.

They did not expect to be blocked by Li Xianyin first.

Li Xianyin’s aura shifted slightly, his eyes narrowing slightly. As he executed his sword moves, he naturally had his own domain and formed his own world. After piercing Xiao Wanjian’s killing move, he advanced rapidly with his steps, ignoring Wang Zongheng who was slashing at him from the side. At this moment, although the swords were combined, Li Xianyin was the lead, and Wen Caishang was the follower. The rhythm and coordination of the swordsmanship were all controlled by Li Xianyin. He wanted to seize the momentum to execute a killing move, and Wen Caishang had to follow his will to coordinate her attacks.

The two swords struck out in succession, attacking together. In an instant, Xiao Wanjian was repeatedly injured by the sword. He barely managed to raise his sword to block, his steps retreating continuously. Every time his foot landed, the ice beneath his feet melted from the heat, leaving a trail of wet footprints. He was affected by the Yin-Yang Couple Sword, the Yin and Yang in his body were imbalanced, his internal organs, flesh, and bones were being boiled, and his whole body burned intensely.

He let out a furious roar, disregarding everything, and thrust his sword fiercely at the two of them. The two executed a series of connected sword moves, slashing left and cutting right, their figures like phantoms. His sword broke piece by piece. The evolution of the Yin-Yang Couple Sword contained the charm of simplifying the complex.

The strange scenes in the sky collapsed and dissolved.

Hu Yueyue and Duan Yixin revealed their figures, shocked by the sight, and immediately came to rescue. They stabbed from both sides. Wen Caishang swept her sword, her soft sword spiraling and extending to intercept Hu Yueyue. Li Xianyin took the opportunity to strike Duan Yixin. His sword seemed to contain a world; as he simply thrust and struck, all kinds of mysteries and wonders rushed toward Duan Yixin.

Duan Yixin had never seen such swordsmanship in his life. For a moment, he was in a panic, deeply experiencing Xiao Wanjian’s predicament. Wen Caishang felt something unusual, but she did not know that above the Peak Perfection realm, there was the "Great Self" realm attainments. For a moment, she couldn't quite grasp the feeling. Although she intended to watch from the sidelines, she was ultimately worried about Li Xianyin. With a few casual moves of her White Snake Soft Sword, she forced Hu Yueyue into a chaotic retreat. Then, with a light tap of her toes, she floated up gracefully, flying over Li Xianyin’s shoulder to attack Duan Yixin from above, joining Li Xianyin to fight a common enemy.

Her two swords scraped Duan Yixin’s cheeks respectively. Duan Yixin was immediately defeated, screaming several times as he flew backward, already falling from the fight. At this time, the Five Mountains Sword Alliance was already showing signs of decline, their morale greatly dampened, unable to achieve greatness. Subsequently, Hu Yueyue and Wang Zongheng were defeated one after another. They resisted stubbornly but could not reverse the defeat. Their swords were knocked away, and they suffered serious injuries.

Wang Zongheng fell into the lake, his whole body wet, the cold piercing his bones.

After Hou Yuande was also defeated, the duel was a great victory. Wen Caishang intended to retract her sword momentum, withdrawing the White Snake Soft Sword back into the 'Void-芥 Demon Robe'. Li Xianyin suddenly extended his sword, his green sword pressing against the body of the White Snake Soft Sword, preventing Wen Caishang from retracting her sword. He kept the momentum of the "Yin-Yang Couple Sword" and stood side by side with her, their swords crossed and pressed against each other.

Wen Caishang was slightly surprised. Seeing Li Xianyin stop her from retracting her sword, she guessed it was due to his cautious nature. She thought: "This boy is extremely cautious. These five elders are all seriously injured; can they really cause any more trouble? Well, walking in the Jianghu, being cautious a bit is only beneficial, not harmful. I'll just let him be."

Hu Yueyue, Wang Zongheng, Xiao Wanjian, Hou Yuande, and Duan Yixin were in a wretched state, supporting each other as they got up. Their bodies were full of holes, sword marks, and scratches, stained with blood.

Hu Yueyue said: "The two of you are truly powerful, as expected... We have suffered a great defeat and are convinced. Regarding the matters of the tomb, it was a offense by our Five Mountains Sword Alliance!"

Wen Caishang thought: "Although I don't put these five people in my eyes, solving it this way, I won't suffer any loss. Moreover, the famous swords and artifacts of the Five Mountains Sword Alliance are indeed extraordinary. If I get them for collection, and Li Xianyin likes them in the future, I can gift them to him to play with, which would be very good." She smiled softly and said: "Since the misunderstanding has been resolved, let's put this matter to rest. The ancients said, 'No acquaintance without a fight.' Since Cai Shang has met you all, I will set up a banquet in a few days to invite the many disciples of the Five Mountains Sword Sect. All matters will be thoroughly explained and clarified at the banquet. How about we bury the hatchet over a drink?"

Hu Yueyue said: "Lady Wen is thoughtful. This is good, this is good." Xiao Wanjian said: "Our Five Mountains Sword Alliance will follow Lady's intention, attend the banquet, and bury our enmity!"

Wang Zongheng sighed: "From now on, regarding the matters of the tomb, no one can easily bring it up. The loss of disciples of our Five Mountains Sword Alliance has nothing to do with Lady. We caused much disturbance in the tomb. Once we return to the sect, we will send out swords to apologize!"

Wen Caishang said slowly: "Cai Shang is truly not a person who covets treasures. There were many misunderstandings in the tomb. I am a weak woman,难免 not handling things perfectly. Speaking of this, I also have faults. Let the past be like smoke and scatter. As for the swords, there is no need."

Xiao Wanjian said: "Lady Wen, the intention of our five sects to send swords is decided. We hope Lady will accept them well." The several elders all persuaded. Wen Caishang sighed: "Well, since things have come to this, if I don't accept, it would seem inhuman. Cai Shang will follow the elders' words."

Li Xianyin suddenly said: "Lady, I think there is something inappropriate." Wen Caishang frowned. Li Xianyin had always been quite obedient and never opposed her words in public. She was slightly annoyed but asked softly: "What is inappropriate? Li Lang, speak up."

Li Xianyin said: "In my opinion, there is no need to hold this banquet to resolve the enmity. The Five Mountains Sword Alliance has gone through many twists and turns on this trip; the elders and disciples must be tired. Since the misunderstanding has been cleared, it is better to return to the sect early to avoid further trouble."

The five people looked at each other. Wen Caishang asked softly: "The Five Mountains Sword Alliance has a great reputation. Villains like He Wentian who are bold, insidious, and cunning are rare after all. Li Lang, do you dislike them, or do you find the banquet too noisy?"

Li Xianyin said: "I think the banquet is better not held. This way, Lady can save some money. I am thinking for Lady."

Wen Caishang stared at him, seeing Li Xianyin’s normal expression, she faintly sensed something unusual. She smiled: "Then according to Li Lang, how should this matter be handled?"

Li Xianyin said: "I said earlier, please have the Five Mountains Sword Alliance return to the sect quickly. Pretend you never met us in Feilong City." Wen Caishang stared at Li Xianyin for a few breaths, then smiled at the five elders: "Well, since Li Lang has spoken, then the banquet matter, I can only follow his wish. Elders, please return."

Hu Yueyue, Duan Yixin, Wang Zongheng, Hou Yuande, and Xiao Wanjian all felt the atmosphere was微妙. But they knew Lady Wen Caishang’s temperament well; she could hide killing intent behind a pleasant and soft voice. Staying far away from this woman was always the right choice. They all cupped their hands: "Since that is the case, then we will take our leave. Since all matters are settled, our Five Mountains Sword Alliance will withdraw tomorrow."

After the five people left, Wen Caishang’s expression was calm. Her beautiful eyes looked at Li Xianyin deeply and said: "Li Lang, I really dislike your performance just now."

Li Xianyin said: "Lady, I was thinking for you." Wen Caishang said softly: "Stop talking nonsense, you can't fool me. Why did you rush to drive them away?"

Li Xianyin said in a deep voice: "Naturally, so that no one disturbs us anymore. Lady, I have something to tell you." Wen Caishang frowned: "What do you want to do?"

Li Xianyin said: "Lady, thanks to your care, helping me in the martial path, teaching me martial arts, and teaching me Jianghu experience. I have always been true to you."

Wen Caishang usually enjoyed hearing sweet words and was naturally happy. But in this situation, she was sure Li Xianyin had more to say. Her eyes narrowed slightly, the surrounding wind and snow howled, hiding a sharp pressure. She asked: "And then?"

Li Xianyin couldn't help feeling nervous. He had never truly faced the Lady, nor stood against her. At this moment, he felt immense pressure, like a thorn in his back, a fishbone in his throat. He forced himself to be calm and said: "But Lady... I want to go out and roam around."

Wen Caishang immediately understood: "So that's it. He stopped me from retracting the sword momentum earlier, wanting to use his attainments in the Waning Sun and Fading Blood Sword to surpass me, using this to suppress me. Now that there is no one else, he thinks he can rely on this to defeat me, and now he reveals his fangs. Little ingrate, quite scheming! You have done this repeatedly, do you really think I have a good temper?" An unusual light flashed in her beautiful eyes, and she made a move to retract her sword.

The two swords were crossed. When she retracted her sword by half, Li Xianyin advanced by half. The sword momentum was maintained, and Yin and Yang remained balanced. Wen Caishang knew her guess was correct, and a coldness arose in her heart. But on the surface, she smiled kindly: "Li Lang, do you want to leave me again?"

Li Xianyin said: "No." Wen Caishang said: "Oh?" Li Xianyin said: "My roots are always with the Lady, and I will always return. It's just going out to roam, not leaving the Lady. I hope the Lady will allow it."

Wen Caishang asked: "How long to roam? One year? Two years? Three years? Li Lang, are you really willing to leave me alone in the empty manor, with no one to accompany me?" Li Xianyin said sincerely: "I am naturally unwilling, but a man has ambitions all over the world. If the Lady does not stop me this time, I will surely return."

Wen Caishang’s face turned cold instantly. She had always been very good at controlling her temper. Even if she was furious, her face remained normal. But now she couldn't help losing her composure, extremely angry and unable to endure it anymore. She sneered: "Good boy, I see you don't know the immensity of heaven and earth, thinking your wings are hard. What 'a man has ambitions all over the world', and asking me to wait for you? What are you? Are you worthy of my waiting? What am I waiting for? You go out and enjoy yourself freely, and when you need me, come back to me? Am I that foolish, that I can't live without you?"

Li Xianyin mocked himself: "I said the wrong thing. If the Lady has other choices, how could I be worthy of saying a word more."

This remark made Wen Caishang even more furious. She couldn't help but scold: "Brat!" Her expression softened slightly, her eyes narrowed, and she said coldly and indifferently: "Li Xianyin, I know your plan. If you take back your words now and obey my arrangements honestly, I can still pretend nothing happened."

Wen Caishang said coldly: "To tell you the truth, this morning dew was specifically to lure you here. All my hard work was indeed to find you back. If you escaped once, I could attribute it to your playful nature. If you escaped twice, I could still say you don't know what's good for you. If you try to escape a third time, you are simply courting death."

"Do you think I, Wen Caishang, to keep a man, would really do it a second, third, fourth, or fifth time? If you anger me, even though I like you, do you think I won't kill you? I, Wen Caishang, have never been this patient with anyone. I have done my utmost for you. You should know when to stop. If we really fight, the outcome is something you cannot bear."

Her voice was light, but the moment it was heard, the atmosphere became even more deadly. The wind and snow stopped completely, and fish and beasts in the lake died inexplicably, floating to the surface.

Li Xianyin said bitterly: "Lady, why must you..." Wen Caishang said coldly: "Hmph, why do I need to ask you? If it weren't for me, you would be nothing but a dirty servant, your life as cheap as mud. Who helped you wash your marrow, who taught you martial arts, where did your first martial art come from, who helped you build your martial foundation? You are inherently my property. If I am happy, I will reward you with a few grapes. If I am unhappy, I will give you a few beats or a few sword strikes."

"I thought you were loyal and treated you better. But you, on the other hand, became increasingly arrogant, unable to figure out your status, and did these rebellious things. If I were to hold you accountable, you should have been cut to pieces long ago. I only found you somewhat fresh, with decent talent and looks, so I tolerated you more to relieve my loneliness. When I tire of you someday, what will you be? You don't bother to please me with all your heart, yet you are so ungrateful. Ridiculous, absurd, foolish." At this moment, she was extremely angry, and her words were extremely vicious.

Li Xianyin sighed in his heart: "So this is how the Lady sees me." He became even more determined and said calmly: "Since that is the case, why should you be angry to let me go? I, this servant boy, was originally alone. Like that snowflake, I can float freely, light or heavy. Let it float far away, what's wrong with that? If we speak of kindness, I have saved the Lady's life once, let's call it even. From now on, we won't disturb each other, wouldn't that be better?"

Wen Caishang’s anger increased sharply. Her chest heaved up and down. She had never had a day in her life where she was so angry. She felt that if she leaked half of the anger in her heart, it would be enough to melt the snow for miles around. She said sternly: "You lowly slave, saving me is your duty, what kindness to repay? There has always been only you owing me, when have I ever owed you? Hmph, what snowflakes, floating around, I only find it extremely碍眼 (obstructing to the eye)." She flicked her sleeve. The snowflakes all turned to dust.

Li Xianyin said: "Hmph! Since that is the case, what else is there to say? If I am not your match, I will just die."

Wen Caishang suddenly paused. Seeing Li Xianyin’s determined and cold expression, her heart ached and was angry at the same time. She realized her words had been too heavy just now. She had very little experience in emotional matters and didn't know how to handle it. Suddenly, she wanted to挽回 (retrieve挽回), wanting to tell Li Xianyin that what she said just now were all angry words. But then she thought, who is she, Wen Caishang? Why should she lower herself to this little thief? She thought resentfully: "Wait until I capture this little thief, today's affair will make you regret it for life!" She said: "Good, good, brat, by then, you will wish for death but not be able to."

She said coldly: "You want to play, I will play with you." The White Snake Soft Sword struck instantly. Li Xianyin focused his energy to defend. Wen Caishang executed the "Frost Moon Void Sword," and Li Xianyin executed the "Waning Sun and Fading Blood Sword," always within the笼罩 (encompassment) of the Yin-Yang Couple Sword.

Just like the past when the swords were combined, this time the sword edges turned inward. Wen Caishang thought: "Although your Yang sword attainments are higher than mine, your experience in fighting enemies and martial arts evolution are far inferior to mine. To use such means to oppose me, incredibly foolish." Her attacks were extremely fierce.

No matter how Wen Caishang attacked, Li Xianyin always kept his sword body close, analyzing her moves as they came, resolving everything. Wen Caishang sensed something was wrong. The two of them had their swords combined, the sword momentum covering them. When Yang is deficient, Yin supplements; when Yin is deficient, Yang supplements... Wen Caishang’s cultivation was very high, and her Yin sword evolution was extremely terrifying. Li Xianyin’s cultivation was lower, so his Yang sword evolution was inferior. But during their exchange, Wen Caishang’s moves would instead help the Yang sword evolution to deal with her own Yin sword.

This kept the two swords balanced. The momentum was like fire and water, yet always balanced. Wen Caishang realized in her heart: "No wonder he has the courage to seek me out to oppose me. Hmph, just the Yin-Yang Couple Sword indeed gives you too much advantage. Within the sword momentum, even though your cultivation is low, you can resist me for a long time. But the Yin-Yang Couple Sword is just a superior sword art. Do I, Wen Caishang, know no other moves besides this?"

She immediately executed other martial arts, but suddenly felt the sword momentum was soft and sticky, the Yin and Yang qi entwining around the two of them. Li Xianyin’s sword moved with his body, the Great Self attainments appeared, and he turned客 (guest) into主 (master), actively guiding Wen Caishang.

Wen Caishang was covered by the sword momentum, her face changed drastically. She was shocked to find that she was身不由己 (not following her own will), and all her martial arts and cultivation... were extremely difficult to execute. She was trapped within the Yin-Yang Couple Sword momentum and found it hard to break free for the moment. She could only passively receive the moves.

Wen Caishang exclaimed in surprise: "How is this possible?" While resisting Li Xianyin’s sword moves, she tried to break free. Just a moment of breaking free would allow her to capture Li Xianyin instantly.

Wen Caishang grew more shocked as she fought. "I know his Waning Sun and Fading Blood Sword has Peak Perfection attainments. Although it is stronger than mine by a section, it shouldn't be enough to trap me in the sword momentum so that I cannot escape." She gritted her silver teeth, glared fiercely at Li Xianyin, and cursed in a muffled voice: "Brat! Cunning!"

She was now in a dilemma, having thought several times of dropping her sword to break free. But the sword handle seemed to suck her hand. Yin and Yang entangled, the principle was profound. Wen Caishang’s forehead broke out in a sweat, growing more and more strained. Her beautiful eyes were extremely shocked: "This is clearly the Yin-Yang Couple Sword. Even if you are at Peak Perfection, you shouldn't be this powerful. What demonic art did you use?"

Li Xianyin smiled: "Lady, have you ever heard of the 'Great Self' realm?"

Wen Caishang said: "Great Self?" Her pupils contracted slightly. She was learned and had seen the words "Great Self" in ancient books. But it was too mystical. Among countless martial arts through the ages, there were those at Peak Perfection, but records of the "Great Self" realm were rare. So she only treated it as a miscellaneous tale, or someone with shallow knowledge mistaking the "Peak Perfection" or "Perfection" realm for the "Great Self" realm.

Wen Caishang gritted her silver teeth and said in a deep voice: "Your Waning Sun and Fading Blood Sword has already been practiced to above Peak Perfection? Stepped into the Great Self realm? Does such a martial arts attainment really exist in the world?"

Li Xianyin said: "Naturally it does. Otherwise, the Lady would have defeated me long ago. For me to deal with the Lady, the only thing I can rely on is the 'Yin-Yang Couple Sword,' using the time when I combine swords with the Lady to take full advantage of her."

Wen Caishang was extremely shocked and angry, cursing: "Good scheming, good scheming. I should have realized you would never do anything unprepared. Since you dare to turn against me, you must have the confidence to deal with me."

Li Xianyin shook his head: "I never turned against the Lady. It was the Lady's words just now that made me heartbroken." Wen Caishang felt a pang in her heart, but she angrily said: "Brat, watch my sword." She thrust several times, but was casually deflected by Li Xianyin.

Wen Caishang had never suffered such a great loss, but the more she fought, the weaker she felt. It was like an old man playing with a child. She had high cultivation, but Li Xianyin used her cultivation to suppress her sword art. Wen Caishang shouted coldly: "Brat, you have the advantage and can indeed拖 (drag) me for a while. But once the sword momentum散 (disperses), in my eyes, you are just an ant that can be pinched to death instantly. You want to leave, dragging it out like this, where can you go?"

Li Xianyin saw Wen Caishang’s anger hard to hide. He had never seen the Lady in such a state, her cheeks flushed, staring angrily, yet with a unique charm. He said: "Lady, don't you understand me? The Yin-Yang Couple Sword contains the principles of Yin and Yang, and truly has the ability to simplify the complex and turn the immortal into the mortal."

"Using your cultivation to slowly evolve the principles in the sword. It can naturally make you unable to use your cultivation for several days."

Wen Caishang angrily said: "You dare!" Seeing an opportunity, she kicked with her right foot. Li Xianyin did not dodge but grabbed instead, seizing her ankle. Wen Caishang was forced to stand on one foot, her White Snake Sword still striking at Li Xianyin, barely managing to defend.

Li Xianyin said: "Things have come to this, what is there I dare not do?" Wen Caishang let out a soft "Ah," her right boot had been removed. Her pretty face flushed red, and her anger dissipated somewhat. Then, shame and anger became unbearable. She thrust her soft sword at Li Xianyin’s left ribs, forcing him to protect himself, and hastily pulled her foot back.

Now her hair was slightly messy, long hair fluttering, her demeanor still elegant. But one foot bare, one foot shod, she looked very strange and狼狈 (wretched). Wen Caishang wanted to pull away to break free, but Li Xianyin’s "Yin-Yang Couple Sword" was superior to hers.

After a few more rounds. Li Xianyin took the opportunity to grab and took the golden hairpin holding Wen Caishang’s hair. Wen Caishang’s long hair fell like a waterfall. She gritted her silver teeth, so angry that her eyes shot fire. Even during her escape in the past, seriously injured, she had not felt this憋屈 (wronged).

Just as the sword tips clashed, amidst layers of sword shadows. Wen Caishang executed "Falling Moon Like Drop," and Li Xianyin executed "Hanging Sun Standing." The two moves met, and Li Xianyin immediately turned his sword body. Wen Caishang’s attainments were far inferior to his, and was led by his long sword. He suddenly reached out and揽 (embraced) Wen Caishang into his arms.

Wen Caishang felt the warmth at her waist, her body went soft, and her anger dropped by another three points. Her heart was filled with helplessness and wrongness, extremely regretful: "I should have realized this boy had another trick up his sleeve. Now it's good. He has gained the upper hand, even I am not safe anymore."
