# Chapter 163: Familiar Scene

Zhou Tian noticed that most of the various flying ships, chariots pulled by divine beasts, and so on, were flying in that direction. As they drew closer, he saw that in this area, above the adjacent skyscrapers, ferocious beasts appeared on the rooftops, radiating terrifying light.

This place seemed to be the central, bustling area of the city. Many divine beasts no less powerful than the Nine-tailed Phoenix Bird appeared here, and their masters were also exceptionally formidable.

The top of this high-rise building used a spatial expansion formation, and many divine beast carriages were parked there. The most eye-catching was a crimson ferocious beast, with a pair of ox horns on its massive wolf head, exuding immense savagery.

It had five tails and resembled a true dragon, black as ink, with a ferocious dragon head and a wide-open maw full of sharp fangs.

Although it emitted no overt ferocity, simply by lying prostrate, it still caused other ferocious beasts to keep a distance. Even the Phoenix Bird stopped far away, seemingly intimidated.

As if sensing someone's arrival, the ferocious beast opened its eyes. Its black-crimson beast pupils glanced at Saint Devil before closing again.

"It can't be a Heavenly King, can it?"

Zhou Tian, seeing the Phoenix Bird's strange reaction, couldn't help but ask Saint Devil. The Phoenix Bird was already an Emperor-level ferocious beast, and its bloodline was noble, not ordinary among its peers. For it to feel fear, an Emperor-level beast probably wasn't enough.

"That's right, this is a Nine Netherwolf. It can grow up to a Heavenly Venerate, and it will have nine dragon tails then," Saint Devil explained.

Zhou Tian clicked his tongue in wonder. Now *this* was what you called a true second-generation (privileged) individual.

Descending through the exclusive passage from the rooftop, the interior was lavishly decorated, fitted with a special formation. For each group of people entering, a dedicated passage would open up. This was because they were all supreme figures; even a slight difference in their order of entry could spark a major conflict.

The service attendant at the end of the corridor was a tall, exceptionally beautiful woman with silky black hair and a perpetual sweet smile. In front of her was a projection displaying various types of suites. Saint Devil was clearly familiar with the process and began to handle the registration.

"Isn't there a Heavenly Venerate suite left? It looks pretty good," Zhou Tian said, pointing to the topmost room on the projection. The description and pictures showed it was practically an entire world, not just a suite.

"Can't afford it," Saint Devil said matter-of-factly, then booked an Emperor-level suite.

"..."

*He's a Heavenly King, yet he's staying in an Emperor-level suite. Isn't that shameful?* Zhou Tian grumbled inwardly.

Although it was an Emperor-level suite, its decorations were still dazzling. For instance, on one wall hung a painting of a fierce tiger descending a mountain. Upon closer inspection, the frame actually contained a specimen of a winged tiger, its muscles truly menacing, runes faintly visible—it was incredibly extraordinary.

It was fine not to look closely, but once one did, a sharp aura assailed them, as if the silver tiger claws were about to tear space itself apart.

Next to it, a potted plant, a ten-thousand-year-old Dragon Blood Pine, was as vigorous as a coiled dragon, yet stood less than two meters tall, radiating a strong presence.

Every casual decor piece was clearly no ordinary item.

"Aren't we going to that Heavenly..."

Before Zhou Tian could finish, Saint Devil's eyes flickered, and a rune sealed his mouth, making him mumble incoherently.

Then, she took out an array disk. Golden runes danced, forming a grand array that seeped into every part of the room, only then releasing Zhou Tian's seal.

"Alright, you can speak now. A while ago, a powerful individual revealed that many restaurants and hotels are fitted with formations to steal information and sell it to intelligence organizations. Although the Heaven-Reaching Company has an excellent reputation, some precautions must be taken." Saint Devil explained.

Zhou Tian was silent for a moment, feeling an increasing sense of familiarity with this place.

"When are we going to that Heavenly Venerate tomb?"

"That place still has some time before it opens. We'll have to wait here for a bit," Saint Devil replied, sitting cross-legged on a bed made of shimmering precious jade, her body glowing.

"Then I can't just stay here all the time, can I?" Zhou Tian frowned. He had already wasted many resurrection chances on the ship. He needed to find a place to seek death and level up, otherwise, when would he ever advance?

"What do you want to do?"

"I want to go out and look around," Zhou Tian said after thinking. He wanted to get a feel for this place, as it was completely new to him.

"No," Saint Devil refused.

"If you don't let me out, I'll be very uncomfortable. And if I'm uncomfortable, I won't perform well. What if I make a mistake then... you understand, right?" Zhou Tian said, his tone subtly hinting at a threat.

Saint Devil's eyes fixed on Zhou Tian, who didn't back down. After a moment, Saint Devil spoke, "Alright, but the Phoenix Bird must accompany you."

"No need, are you afraid I'll run away?"

Saint Devil said nothing, but her eyes blazed, her meaning self-evident.

Zhou Tian decided not to engage in a staring contest with such a formidable man and waved his hand. "Fine, fine, let her follow."

"Also, this place belongs to the Heaven-Reaching Company. This faction is neutral and doesn't get involved in anything. Even if you reveal your identity, they won't offer you any help, nor will they notify anyone from the Nine Provinces," Saint Devil said slowly. Although her tone was calm, she was effectively warning Zhou Tian.

"I didn't plan to escape. A Heavenly Venerate tomb is waiting for me; why would I leave?" Zhou Tian truly had no intention of leaving. Although he couldn't use the things inside the Heavenly Venerate tomb himself, his Zhou family could.

"Recently, the Star Realm has been in turmoil, with many forces targeting the Nine Provinces. Even if you haven't shown your face in the Star Realm, there might be ill-intentioned individuals. This is a rare treasure that can change your appearance. I've imbued it with spiritual power, so it can last for a while." Saint Devil pulled something thin as a cicada's wing from the void. It seemed to have the outline of a human face and gently floated onto Zhou Tian's face, then adhered to it.

Zhou Tian only felt a cool sensation on his face; otherwise, he felt nothing. When he looked into a mirror conjured by Saint Devil, he saw that he had changed into another person's appearance, with a full beard and a fierce, menacing look.

"Remember, this is the Star Realm, not your Zhou family's small patch of land in Futian Province. It's not even surprising to encounter a Heavenly Venerate here. Although direct use of force is usually restricted, some powerful individuals have special privileges. I know you have special methods, but they might be insufficient against a Heavenly Venerate." Saint Devil cautioned meticulously, fearing Zhou Tian might stir up major trouble.
