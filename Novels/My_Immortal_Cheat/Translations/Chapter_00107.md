Chapter 107: Escape

The Ash Cult members didn't just blindly flee; they continuously unleashed various divine arts. Flames raged, the ground turned to lava, and the temperature became scorching hot, hindering their pursuers.

Bor, the most powerful among them, was restrained by Zhou Tian, making it difficult for the remaining pursuers to stop the Ash Cultists' retreat, even with their full effort. The Ash Spear tightly bound Myriad Flames; crimson divine chains extended from the spear, locking down space layer by layer. Even with Myriad Flames' full power, he could only resist the erosion and could not break free. This was a divine art Anduin had unleashed by consuming his own divine blood to forcibly activate the deepest power of the Ash Spear. He was not the Lord of Ash, and to fully wield the Ash Spear's might, he had no other choice. It was a forbidden technique, and he would need a long time to recover afterward.

"You are not an evil cultist, so why are you fighting us to the death?!" Bor suppressed his inner rage. He couldn't see through Zhou Tian's true nature; despite seemingly full of openings, Zhou Tian could block his attacks every time and even launch sharp counter-attacks, yet he never actively initiated an attack, almost as if he were toying with him. Furthermore, escaping from the Inquisition was incredibly unbelievable. This was an ancient remnant Inquisition, not some garbage they had built themselves. Even with Anduin's cooperation, it was astonishing. After all, so many creatures were imprisoned within; why was he the only one who could cooperate with Anduin?

"Why?" A thoughtful expression appeared on Zhou Tian's face. "It was an afternoon, running under the setting sun was my fading..."

"Enough!" Bor roared. Regardless of whether Zhou Tian was hiding his strength, the Ash Cult was about to leave Cyler City, and the Holy Knights pursuing them had suffered heavy casualties without his help. Milky white light flared up. Bor's aura surged. His left hand held a sword, and his right hand ignited with holy flame, transforming into a holy hammer, which he hurled at Zhou Tian. Then, his speed soared, turning him into a streak of light, bypassing Zhou Tian and rushing towards the Ash Cult.

Zhou Tian shrugged helplessly, allowing the holy flame hammer to strike him. "You asked me why, and then you don't let me explain. Why is this person so dramatic?" With a flicker, he instantly blocked Bor's path. The power levels in the Land of the Forsaken Gods were severely inflated, likely due to a lack of inheritance. A figure like Bor had almost stepped into the Saint King realm, yet he severely lacked various techniques, only knowing how to swing sword qi and throw hammers. He couldn't even use basic spatial manipulation and relied solely on physical speed. In terms of overall strength, he was just an ordinary Saint, albeit a bit more muscular.

"I haven't finished speaking yet. Why are you so rude?" Zhou Tian said, displeased, then hurled the holy hammer he had just absorbed. Bor frowned deeply. A light shield appeared on his surface, blocking the holy flame-burning hammer. He had a faint suspicion. At first, he thought Zhou Tian was deliberately using the exact same moves as him just to mock him, but seeing the white flames burning on the hammer, he realized things weren't that simple. Just as he was about to make a further attempt, Bor's expression suddenly turned utterly shocked. He glanced back at Myriad Flames, who was still contending with the Ash Spear, and a look of unwillingness flashed across his face.

"Holy Divine Cult members, cease pursuit!" The many pursuing knights stopped, looking at each other, unsure of what had happened. Zhou Tian was also slightly startled. "No more pursuit?"

"I hope you won't regret your actions today in the future." After the initial surprise, a calm expression settled on Bor's slightly aged face as he spoke to Zhou Tian in a placid tone.

Zhou Tian chuckled, "Whether I'll regret it in the future, I don't know. But I do know that a person lives for themselves, not for someone or something else."

Bor's expression remained calm. He had already transcended the realm of 'fanatic' or, rather, entered a higher state. "My existence is for the Lord." His tone was as calm and firm as saying, "I'm hungry, I need to eat."

Zhou Tian said no more. He couldn't say Bor was wrong, nor could he say the Land of the Forsaken Gods was wrong. Right and wrong, correctness or incorrectness, never had a clear boundary. Words could no longer disturb Bor's heart.

Glancing back, the Ash Cultists had already left Cyler City. The Holy Divine Cult members also showed no intention of continuing the pursuit; it seemed they had truly given up, not using any delaying tactics. Zhou Tian scratched his head, looking at Bor. "I wish you... your Lord good health and longevity. Goodbye." Zhou Tian had originally intended to bless Bor, but then he thought that blessing Bor's Lord might make Bor happier.

Bor's eyes burned as he stared at the spot where Zhou Tian disappeared, murmuring, "May the Lord redeem you."

Zhou Tian continuously teleported, chasing along the path the Ash Cultists had taken. Before long, he caught up. Seeing Zhou Tian follow, Zhang Yi and Mu Su visibly sighed in relief. The Ash Cult party did not stop, continuing to gallop without pause. Hundreds of people kept moving, not heading to their old lair near Cyler City. With no pursuers, the Ash Cult also displayed the professionalism of a major sect. A large group of people split off, unleashing various divine arts. Runes filled the sky, and various seals were carved, concealing their tracks.

After galloping for nearly six hours, everyone reached a mountain range that extended from the divine mountain. As soon as they stopped, the Ash Cult members dispersed, exploring the area, carving array patterns, and performing basic defensive work.

"Your cult truly consists of elites; your movements are so practiced." Zhou Tian couldn't help but exclaim upon seeing this scene.

Anduin chuckled awkwardly. It was only because they weren't strong enough that they had to hide everywhere. "Friend, thank you." Anduin forcibly changed the subject, speaking to Zhou Tian with solemnity.

"It was agreed upon, mutual help." Zhou Tian waved his hand. It was just a transaction.

"Once I recover, I will definitely settle this score with the Holy Divine Cult." Anduin rubbed his brows. This time, he had suffered a great loss of vitality; he didn't know how long it would take for the divine blood he lost to recover.

Zhou Tian raised his eyes and glanced at him, disregarding how much posturing was in that statement, and asked, "We've escaped, but your divine artifact is still in Cyler City. Aren't you going to reclaim it?"

Anduin smiled mysteriously, looking unsettling on his pale face. "Still in Cyler City?" He raised his left hand, and an object radiating crimson light appeared in his palm: it was the spearhead of the Ash Spear. The Ash Cultists nearby all looked at him with reverence.

Zhou Tian raised an eyebrow. "This thing is really powerful. Even in such a damaged state, it still has so much might, and it's self-guiding. Anduin just got another reason to show off."
