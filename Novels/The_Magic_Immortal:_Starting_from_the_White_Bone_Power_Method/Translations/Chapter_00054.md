# Chapter 54: The Trading Hall  

After the time it took to burn an incense stick, Wang Chan and the floral-skirted female cultivator finally arrived at a jade-constructed palace after navigating through twists and turns.  

The exterior, illuminated by pale night-luminous stones, appeared eerie. However, the interior was resplendent and luxurious, exuding an air of grandeur.  

The hall was bustling with cultivators, most of whom were at the mid-stage of Qi Refining, their auras deep and formidable. There were even a few late-stage Qi Refining cultivators present. In contrast, early-stage cultivators like Wang Chan were a rare sight.  

Despite his presence alongside the late-stage floral-skirted cultivator, few paid him much attention.  

Wang Chan noticed that many were fixated on a massive jade screen, seemingly engrossed.  

Seeing the scene, the floral-skirted cultivator murmured, "So many people have already gathered here... I hope what I need is still available."  

Wang Chan nodded in agreement.  

Along the way, the floral-skirted cultivator had explained the nature of the Trading Hall.  

First, the Trading Hall provided private transaction rooms akin to teahouse parlors. Cultivators who wished to conduct discreet trades could do so here under the hall's protection and security guarantees. The cost varied depending on the room's grade, ranging from one thousand to ten thousand spirit coins.  

Any misconduct during transactions would be met with severe consequences.  

Second, cultivators could also consign items for sale here. They could freely price their goods and entrust them to the Trading Hall, which would handle the transactions discreetly and securely, ensuring no loose ends. The hall would then list the items for sale.  

Consignors need not worry about the buyers' identities—they only needed to collect their earnings. The hall charged a commission of twenty to thirty percent of the transaction value, a far more reasonable rate compared to conventional shops.  

The cultivators in the hall were scrutinizing the jade screen for information on listed items.  

Wang Chan had only learned of the Trading Hall through the floral-skirted cultivator because it had emerged during this market session without much publicity.  

However, the Trading Hall's existence was a direct threat to conventional shops. With such an alternative, why would any rational cultivator still patronize those shops?  

As the saying goes, cutting off someone's financial lifeline is akin to killing their parents.  

Yet, the Trading Hall stood firm, its formidable backing evident. Even the forces behind the shops could do nothing but watch helplessly.  

Wang Chan immediately thought of the newly arrived Yin God True Monarch from the Misty Cloud Sect. This was a clash between an overpowering newcomer and the entrenched local powers.  

Wang Chan couldn't help but feel a secret delight. Saving ten to twenty percent of his hard-earned money was certainly a boon.  

He wondered about the Yin God True Monarch's name and appearance.  

However, he suspected this favorable situation wouldn't last. By the next market session, even if the Trading Hall remained, its benefits might not be as generous.  

"Green Cloud Shield... a mid-grade artifact with both offensive and defensive capabilities, fifty-two layers of artifact restrictions..." the floral-skirted cultivator murmured as she read an entry. "Pity. If only it were a defensive and evasive artifact."  

With that, she withdrew her gaze and turned to Wang Chan. "Feel free to look around, Fellow Daoist. I'll go consign some unused items."  

Wang Chan didn't respond aloud but instead sent a mental transmission.  

The floral-skirted cultivator paused, then nodded and gestured for him to follow.  

Wang Chan trailed behind her as they approached the counter. A green-robed attendant at the early Qi Refining stage soon led them to a private transaction room with a restriction token and a jade box.  

After briefly explaining the rules, the attendant tactfully withdrew and closed the door.  

Wang Chan surveyed the elegantly furnished room, noting the comfortable-looking jade bed among the tasteful furniture.  

What exactly was the bed for in a transaction room?  

His thoughts were interrupted when he detected a low-grade formation embedded in the room.  

This was a low-grade transaction room, costing one thousand spirit coins per use.  

The floral-skirted cultivator activated the formation and then produced a mid-grade Soundproofing Talisman. With a faint smile, she said, "I hope you're not toying with me, Fellow Daoist."  

Without wasting words, Wang Chan tapped his storage bag and summoned the Water-Avoiding Shuttle.  

"A mid-grade Water-Avoiding Shuttle with forty-eight layers of artifact restrictions. It's in excellent condition—sturdy and well-crafted. Feel free to inspect it."  

The floral-skirted cultivator didn't hesitate. Delighted, she took the shuttle, infused it with a series of spells, and examined it closely with glowing eyes.  

After a while, she set it down and nodded. "What's your price?"  

Though mid-grade artifacts were surpassed by high-grade and supreme-grade ones, the latter were exceedingly rare and priceless. Most cultivators would never even glimpse one, let alone own it.  

High-grade artifacts were similarly scarce. The same applied to high-grade and supreme-grade spells—even if one obtained the techniques, mastering them required exceptional talent and decades, if not centuries, of effort.  

As for divine abilities, without the right destiny, one could only yearn for them in vain.  

Thus, many ordinary late-stage Qi Refining cultivators relied on mid-grade artifacts.  

The Water-Avoiding Shuttle was particularly valuable for its dual defensive and evasive capabilities. Even Wang Chan's Thunder-imbued White Needles required two strikes to breach its defenses.  

"Fifteen thousand."  

"Seven thousand!"  

"You're truly bold. Even an ordinary mid-grade artifact with forty-eight layers would cost more than seven thousand," Wang Chan retorted coldly, his face twitching. "If you lack sincerity, let's call off this deal."  

"You dared to offer a hundred and fifty spirit coins for two mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans earlier. Why can't I counter?" the floral-skirted cultivator shot back, unwavering.  

"...Give me a reasonable offer," Wang Chan said, exasperated.  

"I'll need the Trading Hall to handle the aftermath of this purchase, and that won't be cheap either."  

After some haggling, they settled on eleven thousand spirit coins—a thousand more than Wang Chan had expected.  

Given its rarity and utility, such a premium was standard.  

Truthfully, if the Water-Avoiding Shuttle weren't incriminating and if he didn't already possess [Water-Fire Escape Art], Wang Chan would have kept it for himself.  

However, the floral-skirted cultivator was short on funds and had to compensate with twenty mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans (thirty-six layers each), valued at two thousand eight hundred spirit coins—averaging a hundred and forty per talisman.  

Wang Chan had initially refused but eventually relented after some deliberation.  

In truth, he was pleased.  

These talismans were versatile—useful for both offense and defense—and could be resold at the Black River Market for a slight profit.  

With the deal concluded, the two left the room. After answering the attendant's routine questions, they chatted amicably as they walked.  

"Fellow Daoist, if you have other unused items, consider consigning them here. It's safer than setting up a stall," the floral-skirted cultivator advised kindly, perhaps feeling indebted after obtaining the shuttle.  

"Thank you for the advice," Wang Chan said, clasping his hands. He then sighed. "But my cultivation is shallow, and I lack talent. I had to sell this family heirloom to afford cultivation resources. I have nothing left to consign. After a brief look around, I'll be on my way."  

The floral-skirted cultivator blinked, her clear eyes glinting with amusement. As Wang Chan prepared to leave, she offered a slight bow and said no more.  

Wang Chan returned the gesture calmly and departed with a flick of his sleeve.
