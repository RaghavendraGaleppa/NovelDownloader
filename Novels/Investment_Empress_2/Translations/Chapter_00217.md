# Chapter 217: Everyone, Look at Me!

Night had fallen. The moon was hidden, the wind was high, and silence reigned over the surroundings.

In the woodshed, a cricket chirped incessantly, its calls rising and falling in tandem with a snoring sound, as if exchanging signals.

*Splash—*

A basin of water was poured over his face. Xu Yi jolted awake, his eyes snapping open to see three pairs of eyes staring at him, blocking the light of the candle flame.

"Shopkeeper?"

Feeling the weight of their gazes, Xu Yi couldn't help but shiver.

"Are we... running a black shop?"

Three people stood before him.

The ethereal, cold-as-ice woman wore a blank expression, but the scrutiny in her eyes pierced through one's soul, making it impossible to meet her gaze.

The other woman, dressed in palace attire, was toying with a trophy in her hand—a bone-chopping knife she had taken from a杀手 (shāshǒu, assassin) who had scored a zero in diving.

Only the boss seemed relatively normal, still wearing that gentle smile.

But finding himself tied up like a pig, Xu Yi felt that smile shift from benevolent to malevolent.

"He's awake."

Ying Bing said emotionlessly.

"He's awake, but not fully."

Li Mo shook his head, squinting.

"Let's get this over with. It's getting late."

Shang Wu sounded a bit impatient.

Xu Yi: "!"

Get this over with?

Connecting it to unsavory possibilities, his hair stood on end in an instant.

"Boss, don't turn me into human meat buns!"

"I can join in too! I can run a black shop too!"

"What are you thinking?"

Li Mo didn't quite understand.

A faint, pure light appeared behind him, shining upon Xu Yi.

After much experimentation, Li Mo discovered that his soul not only had a slight effect on altering the flow of time, but it could also soothe the mind and return one to their true nature.

Uh...

Xu Yi's head was wrapped up like a mummy, so his expression was unreadable, but from his eyes, he had seamlessly switched to that "Money-First阎王 (Yánwáng, King of Hell)."

"That day, I was indeed preparing to send a message to the Drizzle Pavilion, but it wasn't for..."

"No need to explain."

"...... Then just do it."

Xu Yi's gaze dimmed. How could a杀手 from the Drizzle Pavilion ever hope for others' trust?

*Sch—*

The blade light descended upon him.

He closed his eyes, yet for a long time, the expected pain never came.

"I believe you."

The ropes were untied. Xu Yi stood frozen in place, the stone-like mask on his face showing a hint of emotion.

He wasn't a person with a strong sense of curiosity, but he couldn't help but ask:

"Why?"

"I acknowledge your greed."

The obscurity in Li Mo's eyes faded.

"...... Thank you."

Xu Yi wasn't sure if he should be happy.

Li Mo added, "Also, back when you killed Zou Gong and Luo Wubing together, it wasn't because your soul was out of control, was it?"

Xu Yi's eyelid twitched, and he lowered his head in silence.

"Alright, everything will go as we agreed. You'll take us to the Black Pavilion."

Li Mo casually tossed the rope aside and clapped his hands.

Xu Xiao'er was also someone who had chosen the wrong profession.

Otherwise, he'd make a decent "Zhuodaoren" (a hired blade).

Xu Yi didn't dwell on the topic. He turned to get his tools, leaving his back to the three of them.

As he changed into night clothes and picked up his weapon, he said, "Having the 'Hall前燕 (Qiányàn, Swallow Before the Hall)' token alone isn't enough. We need to disguise ourselves."

"I have some experience in that area. I can help you."

The boss and the boss lady were too high-profile; they were big targets.

"No need for that (raspy voice)."

"Huh?"

The voice was wrong. Xu Yi turned his head.

At some point, Li Mo had already changed into a set of tight-fitting clothes, a Green Dragon mask covering his face, looking both solemn and mysterious.

Ying Bing had also changed into the outfit she wore during the Wujian Trial.

---

*Limited skins are making a limited-time return...*

It wasn't just the three of them.

The elders and senior brothers and sisters of the Clear Abyss Sect had also,不知何时 (bùzhī héshí, at some unknown time), changed their attire and were standing quietly outside the woodshed.

The whole gang was full of villains.

Little Li Mo, wearing the Green Dragon mask, stood at the very front.

He was a dead ringer for a boss of an evil organization.

Xu Yi: "....."

Who's the professional assassin here?

He suddenly felt he wasn't very professional.

......

The East City Hundred Miles Street in Yunzhou City was part of the old district. Like most cities, Yunzhou had its own gray zone, a place where dragons and snakes mingled, and the roots of local power were deeply entangled.

Where there is light, there is darkness. It's better to channel it than to block it.

"*The霸道女帝愛上我 (The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me)*, latest edition, 200 silver taels per copy."

"Two hundred taels? Is your book cover made of gold or are the pages made of gold?"

"Do you want it or not?"

"If this is the genuine article, I'll definitely take it. Here, it doesn't have the official watermark."

A white knife goes in, a red knife comes out.

But the onlookers were unfazed, each minding their own business. No one made a scene, exclaiming in surprise.

The group stepped onto Hundred Miles Street.

Shang Wu felt a sudden impulse and said with a smile, "This place isn't bad. I quite like it."

"We have business to attend to," Qian Bufan reminded her.

*You like it?*

Then this place must be quite pitiful.

The group was like a ladle of water poured into the sea. Following the original plan, they dispersed, breaking into smaller units.

Only Li Mo's trio went with Xu Yi to the Black Pavilion.

The place was deep within Hundred Miles Street. The further they went, the more they encountered fierce, imposing figures.

They reached the end of the street, where they finally saw a building larger than a tavern. On its plaque were two characters: 'Listen to the Wind' (Tīng Fēng).

In the middle of the night, the Listen to the Wind Tower was bustling with activity, with a constant stream of people coming and going.

"You're sure that no one is allowed to make a move inside the Listen to the Wind Tower?"

"That's right. That's the rule set by the Tower Master."

"And you can also post multi-person missions, allowing multiple assassins to take on the same contract?"

"Yes, because some jobs can't be done by one person."

"Then it's settled."

Li Mo had learned a little something about the Drizzle Pavilion.

It seemed he hadn't truly been a member of the Drizzle Pavilion before, as he wasn't too clear on the finer details.

But it didn't really affect his overall plan.

So, they walked into the tower together.

For a moment, Li Mo felt as if he had walked into the External Affairs Hall of the Clear Abyss Sect, except it was much larger, and the people coming and going were no longer fellow disciples, but assassins walking in the shadows, mutually wary of each other.

"Ten玄晶 (Xuánjīng, Dark Crystals), one hundred thousand taels of gold, three bottles of sixth-rank pills?"

Li Mo saw his own bounty.

Xu Yi took a deep breath. "Yes, Boss, now you understand why the assassins are swarming to you..."

Li Mo nodded and sighed. "So assassins are this poor."

Xu Yi: "....."

That bounty is equivalent to the entire fortune of an Inner Scene expert.

"Are you two here to take the contract on Li Mo as well?"

The receptionist at the front desk was a gaunt old man with a green birthmark on his face.

Li Mo didn't answer, just stared at the list of missions.

"An Inner Scene expert failed today. Li Mo must have powerful protectors with him."

"So what if he has protectors? There will always be someone they can't handle."

"Heh, nineteenth on the潜龙榜 (Qiánlóng Bǎng, Hidden Dragon List). What a grand reputation."

"There was once someone twelfth on the list, and they still fell to the endless onslaughts of the Drizzle Pavilion."

"That was the圣女 (Shèngnǚ, Holy Maiden) herself who made the move."

"I love killing geniuses the most. I'll take a shot at that contract!"

"I wonder if he'll go into hiding. If he disappears, I'll have to spend money to buy info on him..."

There were even assassins eager to step up and claim the bounty.

Clearly, this wasn't a solo mission either.

Li Mo wanted to get this over with as soon as possible, so he suddenly raised both hands high and deactivated the Formless Silk.

"Everyone, look at me!"

"I am Li Mo!"
