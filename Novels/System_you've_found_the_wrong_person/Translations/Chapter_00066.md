# Chapter 66: The Hundred Schools' Master, Gongshu Zi!

The island in the lake.  

The water was emerald green, crystal clear.  

The oars gently paddled, stirring ripples that shimmered like strokes in a painting.  

Jin Wuming stood against the wind, his silver-white hair fluttering, his expression numb as he remained silent, resembling a statue.  

Dou Changsheng observed Jin Wuming, knowing the man had been careless. The rumors about Leng Wuye losing three consecutive matches to Hei Fu and having his Mechanical Saint Fist broken were completely false.  

The Leng Wuye before them was a mass-produced version—naturally less refined and inevitably weaker in strength.  

Thus, the story of Hei Fu shattering his mentality and breaking the Mechanical Saint Fist made perfect sense.  

It was airtight, logical.  

Not just Jin Wuming—even Dou Changsheng had been fooled.  

His gaze shifted to the motionless figures standing like door gods at the stern of the boat.  

Speaking of which, Gongshu Duwang was truly something.  

This Leng Wuye was far weaker than a Pure Yang Grandmaster, even inferior to veteran Divine Marvel Grandmasters, but he had undoubtedly crossed the threshold of Divine Marvel—he was a Grandmaster.  

Five Leng Wuyes meant five Grandmasters.  

With enough numbers, even a Pure Yang Grandmaster would kneel—this was perfection.  

Not just Dou Changsheng, even Sun Duxiu’s eyes had been fixed on the five Leng Wuyes from the start. Only Jin Wuming, his spirit broken, paid them no mind.  

These were Grandmasters.  

Not mere cats or dogs, nor common vegetables.  

The strength of a faction was measured by the number of Grandmasters it possessed.  

The Sanyang Sect, once ranked first on the Earthly Rankings and inheritors of the Sanyang Divine Lord’s legacy, had only a single Divine Marvel Grandmaster.  

Of course, this was partly due to the sect’s suppression and dire circumstances, but the power of a Grandmaster was undeniable—they were the backbone of any major faction.  

Given Gongshu Duwang’s status and reputation, five Grandmasters might not be enough, but if the number multiplied, it could only be described as terrifying.  

Suddenly, an idea struck Dou Changsheng.  

He spoke up, "There’s a saying in the martial world: 'One man against a nation—only Gongshu.'"  

"Seeing you today, Senior, I realize the reputation is well-deserved."  

"But there’s one thing I don’t understand. What exactly is the 'Colossus' you mentioned?"  

The five massive figures, previously still as inanimate objects, suddenly stirred. Their gazes locked onto Dou Changsheng in unison as they spoke as one: "You’ve already seen it!"  

Dou Changsheng’s expression showed realization—he had already begun to suspect the nature of the Colossus.  

One of them said, "Colossus."  

Another continued, "Means many."  

The third Leng Wuye explained, "These are Mechanical Saint Fist puppets—ordinary Divine Marvel level, not particularly strong, but their advantage lies in sheer numbers."  

The word "many" resonated deeply with Dou Changsheng.  

Because standing in formation on the island’s dock ahead was an entire row of them.  

Towering figures with massive right arms gleaming with metallic luster stood in ranks, creating an overwhelming visual impact and oppressive presence.  

Gongshu Duwang was aiming for the heavens.  

No wonder he harbored such ambition, daring to establish a Celestial Palace three years later.  

Dou Changsheng had to admit—Gongshu Duwang had the capital for it. The ancient blueprints of the Colossus were proving their worth more and more.  

Another boat approached the dock, and the first man stepped off.  

Golden cloud patterns adorned his sleeves, and the jade pendant at his waist shimmered like flowing mist, glowing intermittently as if alive, exuding an ethereal aura.  

The second man wore a tall hat and flowing robes, his sleeves billowing with each step like a dance, giving him an illusory, unreal presence.  

Only two came from this boat, but those awaiting them on the dock were heavyweights.  

Dressed in simple, almost crude hemp cloth, Jin Wuming—who had been in a state of collapse—suddenly tensed.  

The man before them was of modest height and slender build, resembling a weathered farmer. This was the master of the island, their host—Gongshu Duwang!  

Gongshu Duwang smiled warmly. "Brother Du and Brother Zhangsun gracing my humble island is truly a pleasant surprise."  

Zhangsun Taishi adjusted his tall hat, his voice thin and refined. "Liang Province has suffered greatly. Since Elder Gongshu wishes to speak for Liang, how could we not come?"  

Du Changwang’s expression was solemn, his voice booming across the surroundings. "Are the people of the North human, while those of Liang are not?"  

"The North has its King of Yan, Zheng has its King of Zheng."  

"Why is Liang treated differently?"  

"The Du Clan of Great Liang supports Master Gongshu as King of Liang!"  

Watching this, Dou Changsheng sighed inwardly. Gongshu Duwang, wielding the power of the Colossus, was already overwhelmingly strong—yet he refused to act recklessly. Instead, he leveraged Liang’s grievances to rally support, positioning himself as the voice of the province.  

Instantly, he gained the backing of Liang’s factions—his voice was no longer his alone, but that of countless Liang citizens.  

Liang was wealthy, leading to a decline in martial spirit—but they had money. And what Gongshu Duwang lacked was precisely funds. With money, he could convert it into military might.  

Every component on these Leng Wuyes was likely financed by Liang’s various factions.  

These few sentences carried immense implications, and Dou Changsheng knew they were deliberately spoken for their ears.  

Gongshu Duwang harbored no ambition to carve out territory or rebel—he sought not to turn Liang into his personal fiefdom, but to claim the title of King of Liang and participate in court governance.  

He wasn’t here to smash the game—he wanted to join it.  

Gongshu Duwang smiled. "The title of King of Liang is not my desire."  

"I only ask that the court heed Liang’s voice."  

"To defend against the northern barbarians, there’s no need for northern troops."  

"With sufficient funds, I alone can guard the North."  

"The art of mechanisms is the legacy of Gongshu, traditionally passed down only to sons, never daughters."  

"But I long recognized this as a backward practice. Thus, I founded the Mechanism Sect to spread this art far and wide—the results have been remarkable."  

"Liang is wealthy, its martial spirit waning, its youth growing complacent."  

"But this is not our fault. Comfort breeds reluctance to endure hardship—there’s no crime in prosperity."  

"The poor temper their bodies through grueling training, sleeping later than dogs, rising earlier than roosters."  

"We, the wealthy, have our own path to cultivation."  

"I intend to promote the art of mechanisms, revolutionizing education—open to all, transforming Great Liang City into a city of machines."  

"No need for impregnable fortresses—Great Liang itself shall be the strongest city under heaven."  

"To this end, I’ve already invited the Mohist Grandmaster."  

"Our meaningless feud has lasted a millennium—it’s time to end it."  

This was an invitation to international forces.  

Dou Changsheng was stunned. This Gongshu Duwang was ten times more formidable than he’d imagined.  

If he succeeded, he would become Gongshu Zi—a master among the Hundred Schools, a true sage of the era, perhaps even a saint.
