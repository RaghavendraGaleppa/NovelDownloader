# Chapter 137: He Stands Between Heaven and Earth, Bathed in the Light of the Sky

“Is that Junior Brother Li?”

“It really is him!”

“But isn’t he skilled with the sword?”

“Then... he’s only at the Internal Qi Realm, how can his aura be so powerful?”

“That War Soul must be some kind of秘術 (Mysterious Technique) with immense power, but relying on that alone, it’s probably still difficult to fight against the Internal Scene Realm.”

...

The people below could vaguely see the scene above.

They were all a bit dazed.

Li Mo, who was known for his swordsmanship, suddenly pulled out a hammer and declared he was going to smash the Internal Scene Realm expert and a being comparable to one.

Internal Qi fighting Internal Scene?

Even the writers of storybooks wouldn’t dare to write something so outrageous.

But such a thing couldn’t be said to have never happened, but only under extremely special circumstances, requiring the right timing, terrain, and manpower.

They didn’t know if the current Li Mo met those conditions.

And he wasn’t facing just one Internal Scene expert.

“When necessary, hold nothing back.”

“End this quickly.”

Han Zhen uttered these two words one by one.

This so-called Blood Phoenix Secret Realm was a remnant Cave Heaven left within his Master of Xuan’s bone.

After its owner perished, it had weathered thousands of years of erosion. Its sturdiness was less than one ten-thousandth of what it once was, and it was only able to accommodate those at the Divine Observation Realm because it was supported by the Blood Phoenix Essence.

Now, this Cave Heaven was likely not going to be preserved.

Once the Cave Heaven shattered, the powerful experts outside would inevitably sense it.

Yin Huaxuan nodded in agreement.

The overwhelming Field became increasingly real, as if an ancient Flood Dragon Demon was reviving, its murderous aura shocking the heavens and shaking the earth.

Aflame with phoenix feathers once more, Ying Bing held the Frostrend Sword downwards:

“Leave Yin Huaxuan to me...”

“There’s no need for that.”

Li Mo exhaled a breath of white air. The soaring fighting intent of his War Soul made his voice somewhat distorted:

“You focus on refining the Blood Phoenix Essence.”

“No one can disturb you within a quarter of an hour.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he heard the footsteps behind him stop.

It wasn’t hard to guess.

Those ice-mirror-like eyes were likely fixed on his back, though he didn’t know what expression she wore. Perhaps a hint of silence?

That silence lasted only an instant before the fluctuations of refining the Blood Phoenix Essence began to spread.

“Being the center of attention isn’t bad at all.”

Little Li thought to himself, gripping the Panjie Meteor Hammer and muttering.

He couldn’t help but sigh inwardly:

“Why did it have to be a hammer...”

*Rumble—*

A figure shot up first. It wasn’t Yin Huaxuan, but Han Zhen. His eyes were practically bloodshot, and he had already fallen into madness.

The Blood Phoenix Essence was his foundation, his confidence.

Without this foundation, he would have no chance to start over.

If he died again, it would be true death, with no possibility of returning.

“Die!”

The word ‘die’ seemed to solidify into a tangible form.

The inscriptions on the Master of Xuan’s bone shone brightly, erupting with a terrifying aura that seemed ready to burn everything away, causing the middle-aged Han Zhen to visibly age.

He turned into an old man, yet his aura became even more terrifying. He threw a punch, and before the wind from the fist arrived, the intent of death was already upon one’s body.

“You should have been buried long ago.”

Li Mo charged forward, hammer in hand.

For a time, the sharpness of the Spear of Slaughter纵横 (rampaged), and the formidable force shook the bronze palace until it hummed. The two were locked in a fierce battle.

After exchanging a few moves, Little Li found him rather difficult to deal with.

He was too tough.

Was a Master of Xuan’s bone really unbreakable even by divine weapons?

Of course, it was also possible that his own strength wasn’t enough yet.

Moreover, the opponent was equally immensely strong, with a formidable physical body, and carried a twisting force field like a mire.

When the hammer struck, it felt as if a heavy hammer had landed on cotton.

The Bloodied War Soul Talisman granted him a divine will similar to that of the Divine Observation Realm,凝聚 (condensing) the form of a Hundred Battle Heroic Soul, allowing him to briefly reach the Divine Observation Realm.

But this only lasted a quarter of an hour.

Even at the Divine Observation Realm, he couldn’t sustain the power of the world for long.

Even if the War Soul Talisman could last longer, he wouldn’t be able to use the divine weapon by then.

If he used the Seven Seals of Heaven and Earth... plus the Karma Fire...

He smashed Han Zhen back with a hammer and pointed at Yin Huaxuan, who had been watching from the side, looking for a chance to strike.

“What the hell are you staring at?!”

“Get down here and fight me one-on-two! I’ll take you both on!”

Yin Huaxuan: “?”

He let out a cold snort. This disciple trained by Shang Wu was just like her.

Being pointed at and provoked by a junior, even his composure couldn’t bear it.

*Roar—*

The Flood Dragon Demon coiled, and its beast shadow pressed down like dark clouds, rolling past with astonishing power.

---

“But Junior Brother Li.”

“Aren’t we supposed to be two against two?”

Tang Xiaobao lightly hopped a couple of times on the burning Karma Fire Red Lotus.

“...Let’s not get hung up on the details right now, Senior Brother Tang.”

Li Mo’s mouth twitched.

“We’re going all out now.”

“Alright!”

As Tang Xiaobao’s voice fell.

The Eight Aperture Dragon and Tiger Golden Core began to spin rapidly. The vast Dragon and Tiger Qi brought forth boundless divine might, making the flow of blood and Qi sound as if it truly carried the roar of tigers and dragons.

At this moment.

Li Mo’s body was like divine iron, every movement stirring the winds and clouds.

“Seal the Mountains!”

Little Li didn’t know why he shouted.

Perhaps he felt it made him more imposing.

This hammer strike truly carried a hint of the power to make the continent sink, causing this secret realm to shake violently.

*Bang—*

The materialized shadow of the Flood Dragon Demon was suppressed by the force of Mount Tai pressing down.

“Seal the Storm!”

This hammer, with its incredibly heavy force, pinned Han Zhen’s body down, rendering him unable to move for a short time.

*Rip—*

The ultimate power of wind and thunder surged, instantly plunging the space into darkness.

Li Mo’s hair stood on end as he bathed in thunder.

The Panjie Meteor Hammer in his hand was surrounded by thunder and fire, crackling incessantly.

*Thud—*

This strike, the Thunder Sealing Lightning Strike, completely enveloped Han Zhen.

One hammer strike after another of the Seven Seals of Heaven and Earth was unleashed consecutively.

For a moment, it actually beat Han Zhen and Yin Huaxuan until they couldn’t even lift their heads.

This heaven and earth had already lost its color, swaying as if on the verge of collapse, almost with the momentum of the world being overturned. Under the movements akin to heavenly punishment, it seemed one could hear the secret realm crying out in pain.

...

The people below trembled, their scalps going numb.

It was too terrifying.

So, when power reaches a certain level, it can form a vortex?

Tie Qi: “........So, Brother Ouyang, why does Junior Brother Li practice the sword?”

“Gulp... How should I know?”

Ouyang, who was painting, carefully looked up.

Then, he carefully drew that figure onto the paper.

On the palace, now a scene of ruins.

Ying Bing knew that she shouldn’t be distracted at this moment.

But she couldn’t help but open her eyes.

“Seal the Heaven and Earth!”

This was the final hammer of the Seven Seals of Heaven and Earth.

Used alone, its power wasn’t particularly strong.

As a killing move, it required the preparation of the previous six hammer strikes to maximize the destructive power of this final blow.

Li Mo’s hair crown had long since shattered.

He stood between heaven and earth, his black hair dancing wildly.

*Hum—*

The Panjie Meteor Hammer was completely ignited by the Karma Fire.

Karma Fire Heavenly Punishment, Heaven and Earth Overturned.

“Dodge!”

Han Zhen and Yin Huaxuan both knew.

This hammer strike could not be blocked head-on.

They used all their tricks to evade.

Then they were surprised to discover that this terrifying hammer strike was actually easy to dodge.

Everyone: “???”

They were about to suffocate.

After all that buildup, the attack missed?

“It’s over.”

“From the very beginning, that was his plan...”

Ying Bing let out a soft sigh of relief.

*Crack—*

As the hammer fell.

The sky, like a pitch-black night curtain, emitted a sound of being unable to bear the burden, followed by fine cracks spreading rapidly.

A fragment collapsed.

The sunlight from the outside world shone in, dispelling the countless darkness.

Ying Bing raised her head, and her sparkling eyes were illuminated by a soft glow from a certain person’s figure.

The youth stood between heaven and earth.

Bathed in the light of the sky.
