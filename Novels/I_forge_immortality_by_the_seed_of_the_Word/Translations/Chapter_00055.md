# Chapter 55: The Price Reduction Storm (Part 1)

The dawn arrived quietly.

Inside the talisman crafting room on the second floor.

The candle on the table had long since burned out, its charred wick now cold. Yet Zhang Jing, bathed in the crimson glow of his spiritual light, paid it no mind. His gaze remained fixed ahead as his mid-stage Qi Refinement spiritual sense extended outward without the slightest relaxation.

Through Zhang Jing's dark pupils, one could see two source talismans—one yellow, one red—dancing between reality and illusion, their brilliant spiritual light shimmering as they flitted up and down above the blank talisman paper on the table.

Zhang Jing removed the newly crafted Star Guide Talisman, revealing another blank sheet beneath.

The next moment, the Star Guide Source Talisman slowly descended.

Clear, distinct lines immediately appeared on the paper, forming the complete Star Guide Talisman pattern within mere seconds, emanating intense spiritual fluctuations.

The spiritual energy in the room was continuously drawn in by the source talisman, yet it seemed far from enough. Zhang Jing's own spiritual energy was also being rapidly depleted.

Soon, he deftly took out a Purple Spirit Pill and swallowed it, then refocused his mind on the task of printing talismans.

Time passed.

Only when he felt his spiritual sense growing weary did Zhang Jing finally retract the source talisman.

Taking a deep breath, he turned his gaze to the pile of nearly a hundred freshly crafted talismans on his right.

A hint of astonishment flashed in his eyes.

With the source talisman, his talisman crafting speed had increased by more than tenfold—and there was no such thing as failure rate anymore. As long as his spiritual sense and energy held out, he could continue indefinitely.

This wasn't talisman crafting—it was practically printing Dao achievements!

A thought struck Zhang Jing.

The illusory jade talisman appeared before his eyes.

Only now did he notice that this jade talisman, which had crossed worlds with him, seemed slightly more solid than before.

"Could it be that when my cultivation reaches a certain level, the jade talisman will fully materialize?" he wondered.

His eyes then fell on the information recorded on the jade talisman:

[Ninefold Starlight Talisman Art • Level 3 (357/500)]
Skill Trait: Talisman Source Generation (Intermediate)

Wait—that's not right.

The experience points seemed off.

A trace of surprise flickered in Zhang Jing's eyes. He checked the jade talisman daily and knew every skill's experience points by heart. Yet now, the Ninefold Starlight Talisman Art's experience had increased by nearly a hundred points overnight—a massive leap.

Wait, a hundred?

His gaze returned to the talismans on the table, and a startling speculation formed in his mind.

Could it be that each time the source talisman prints a talisman, it also adds one experience point?

After a moment's thought, it made sense—since the source talisman was part of the Ninefold Starlight Talisman Art skill, it was only natural for it to contribute experience points when used for talisman crafting. Or was it?

Judging by this, among all his skills, the Ninefold Starlight Talisman Art would likely be the first to transform into a Dao Seed.

And the process would be swift!

Zhang Jing thoughtfully summoned the Five Methods Spiritual River.

Twenty-four densely packed spell fish immediately came into view.

After breaking through to mid-stage Qi Refinement, the Five Methods Spiritual River's capacity had doubled, bringing him closer to achieving a true spell torrent.

Though perhaps that wasn't entirely accurate.

Who could say that unleashing twenty-four spells simultaneously didn't qualify as a spell torrent?

In an actual fight, with the Five Methods Spiritual River and the stack of talismans in his storage space, even a sixth-level Qi Refinement cultivator would find him a headache to deal with.

A faint smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

Only now did he feel a semblance of security.

He glanced out the window.

The sky was already bright.

---

On a certain street in the market district, the number of passing cultivators was unusually high today. Yet all moved with hurried steps, their faces alight with excitement as if celebrating a festival.

Occasionally, acquaintances would meet and pause briefly to chat.

Their conversations invariably revolved around today's market-wide price reductions on low-grade talismans, their expressions feverish.

Such scenes were commonplace throughout the market today.

Rumors had spread—no one knew from where—that the talisman masters behind these shops were preparing to return to the Dao Academy, hence the temporary price cuts to clear inventory.

This had sparked a buying frenzy.

After all, most buyers cared little about the reasons behind the price drops—the fact that talismans were significantly cheaper than before was undeniable.

Moreover, if the rumors were true, then buying now was all the more imperative.

Amidst the crowd, two figures carefully navigated the throng.

They were none other than Chu Lingyun and Deng An, who had just returned to the market after their demon-hunting expedition.

"Lingyun, everyone's saying those low-grade talisman masters are leaving. Could it be true? Should we take advantage of the lower prices and buy some too?" Deng An asked the girl walking ahead of him.

At this, Chu Lingyun slowed her pace.

Waiting for Deng An to catch up, she explained in a low voice: "Brother Deng, I specifically asked about this today. Those are just rumors. The demon disturbance hasn't subsided yet—why would those talisman masters leave now?"

"Then why the price cuts?" Deng An's face showed confusion.

He couldn't understand why these talisman masters, who had been happily selling their overpriced talismans, would suddenly lower prices unless they'd gone mad.

And even if that were the case, it made no sense for all low-grade talisman masters to collectively lose their minds.

He'd only been away for five days—how had the market undergone such bizarre changes in that short time?

Could it be that the talisman masters' greed had finally provoked intervention from the Dao Academy higher-ups? Or perhaps the top-ranked hunting squads had stepped in to regulate things?

Deng An's eyes revealed contemplation.

After much thought, this seemed the most plausible explanation.

Just then, Chu Lingyun's voice sounded by his ear:

"Apparently, the talisman masters didn't lower prices voluntarily. They were forced to."

"Forced?" Deng An echoed, his conviction in his earlier speculation growing stronger.

"Exactly. According to senior squad members, a new talisman shop opened on Twin Phoenix Street a few days ago. They sell premium-grade talismans at the same prices as the regular ones sold by other talisman masters."

"The others had no choice but to lower their prices. Otherwise, as time went on, they wouldn't be able to sell a single talisman."

Deng An couldn't help but draw a sharp breath.

This would offend so many talisman masters!

However, the shop owner's ability to do this—selling only premium talismans—meant they either had a high-level talisman master backing them, or were one themselves.

There could be no other explanation.

"There, that's the shop. The senior said its owner has some peculiar rules," Chu Lingyun's voice interrupted Deng An's thoughts.

Coming back to himself, Deng An realized Chu Lingyun had led them to Twin Phoenix Street.

Following her pointing finger, his eyes fell upon a two-story pavilion.

"A talisman shop? What a strange name!"

Deng An couldn't help but remark.

Unlike the bustling scenes at other talisman shops today, this establishment seemed unusually quiet.

In his field of vision, Chu Lingyun had already started moving toward the shop.
