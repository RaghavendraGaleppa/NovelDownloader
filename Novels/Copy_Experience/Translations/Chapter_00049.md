# Chapter 49: Golden Core Ancestor (Two-in-One)

Mingyuan Manor was about twenty *li* from Weidu. It was located on a small hill called Mingyuan Mountain. This hill wasn't particularly remarkable, but at its base lay a high-grade Tier 1 spirit vein.

This was a Wei family villa, where some spiritual herbs were cultivated. Normally, over a hundred cultivators were stationed here, along with a tenth-level Qi Condensation expert in charge. Today, this Wei family manor was bustling like never before.

Large numbers of cultivators, holding invitations, arrived one after another from Tianmen City and Weidu. All those invited were influential figures—either experts above the fifth level of Qi Condensation, or well-known alchemists, talismansmiths, and so on. The Fourth Prince commanded considerable respect; most of the invitations he sent out received a response, and roughly one to two hundred people arrived at the manor.

Inside the manor was a grand palace, large enough to accommodate over a thousand people. Upon arriving at the manor, these cultivators were led into the palace and seated behind jade tables. The Fourth Prince sat at the head seat. To his left was the tenth-level Qi Condensation expert overseeing the manor, and to his right was his personal guard. The High-grade Alchemist surnamed Hong did not appear; given his status, it would have been somewhat demeaning for him to attend such an occasion.

Among the invited guests, the most conspicuous were the Mo family delegation. Mo Changzong, a ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivator, had cultivation that surpassed the masses, while Mo Qingchan, a seventh-level Qi Condensation cultivator, had a beauty that outshone all others. Naturally, these few members of the Mo family were invited to sit in the foremost positions.

When most of the guests had arrived, the Fourth Prince scanned his surroundings but did not see the figure he wished to see.

"Your Highness, it seems that person has not arrived!" the guard beside him whispered via spiritual transmission, his lips barely moving.

The Fourth Prince's expression darkened slightly, and he let out a soft snort, but immediately, his face was once again wreathed in a warm smile. He clapped his hands, and immediately, young maidens carrying trays entered the main hall in an orderly procession. They placed pots of spiritual wine and spiritual tea on the jade tables in front of each cultivator. As their dresses swayed gracefully, wafts of delicate fragrance emanated from these women. Each one was exceedingly beautiful, a pleasure to behold.

Immediately, a wild and unrestrained cultivator burst into two hearty laughs, grabbed a maiden passing by him, and pulled her into his embrace. After a surprised gasp, the maiden immediately calmed down. She showed no panic, and instead, her eyes became seductive, her body climbing onto him as pliable as a water snake.

The Fourth Prince smiled at this scene: "These are all noble ladies from prominent families, from princely and marquis' residences, exceptionally talented. If any of you like them, feel free to choose one or two to take with you after the banquet!"

Upon hearing this, many cultivators immediately smiled, and some cupped their hands, saying, "The Fourth Prince is truly generous!" Such acts of gifting a few mortal beauties at a banquet were not uncommon in the cultivation world; rather, they were considered a form of pleasantry. To cultivators, mortal women were merely objects to be taken as they pleased. No matter how beautiful a woman was, as long as a cultivator saw her, they could seize her, and no one would find anything wrong with it. And for many mortal women, they even wished to be noticed by cultivators. If they could gain the favor of such a person, it would truly be like a sparrow transforming into a phoenix.

After the banquet had been underway for a while, the Fourth Prince clapped his hands, and the main hall gradually fell silent. He smiled and looked around, saying: "Gentlemen, I have invited you all here today, on one hand, to follow our imperial tradition and become more acquainted with everyone. On the other hand, it's also because this Prince has a joyful announcement to make!"

As soon as his voice fell, someone immediately asked, "What good news is it?"

The Fourth Prince did not rush to answer. Instead, he pointed at Mo Changzong and said: "Many of you must have heard of Fellow Daoist Mo Changzong. Since the unfortunate demise of Mo family patriarch Mo Changkong, Fellow Daoist Mo Changzong has become the new patriarch of the Mo family!"

Mo Changzong stood up and bowed to everyone present with a smile. Many cultivators in the hall showed serious expressions; after all, this was a great master at the ninth level of Qi Condensation. Furthermore, he was the patriarch of the Mo family, which was once one of the Nine Great Powers. Although they had declined now, their prestige had endured for centuries, and many still held them in high regard. With the Wei family's support, the Mo family might one day return to Qinghu!

"With the Mo family patriarch's consent, Qingchan and I will soon become Dao companions. Today, I hope all fellow Daoists can bear witness!" the Fourth Prince said with a smile.

Upon hearing this, everyone's gaze turned towards the woman in the black dress, whose beauty was captivating. Although there were so many exquisite beauties chattering in the hall, she still outshone them all, surpassing everyone else. Mo Qingchan's expression was indifferent. There was no change in her beautiful face, as if the discussion just now had not been about her. Seeing her demeanor, the cultivators knew that this Mo family prodigy was likely not very satisfied with the marriage. But this didn't matter; as long as the Mo family patriarch agreed to it, that was enough. With the support of the Mo family patriarch, the Fourth Prince could claim righteousness. With the power he commanded, Mo Qingchan would be helpless even if she disagreed!

No one cared what Mo Qingchan herself thought. Upon hearing this, everyone began to consider the potential implications of this marriage. Undeniably, Mo Qingchan possessed a high-grade spirit root, and so did the Fourth Prince. This alliance was a union of strength. After their union, the Fourth Prince would gain the assistance of the Mo family's power. Although the Mo family was in a deplorable state now, a lean camel was still bigger than a horse. Their remaining power and resources were still considerable, capable of providing great assistance to the Fourth Prince.

"Hahaha, Your Highness has a high-grade wood spirit root, and Qingchan has a high-grade water spirit root. You two are truly a perfect match!" Mo Changzong said with a laugh.

The information revealed in his words immediately startled some cultivators who were unaware of the inside story. Water nourishes wood. If the Fourth Prince received Mo Qingchan's assistance, how quickly would his cultivation advance? There was no shortage of dual cultivation secret arts in the imperial family; it was easy to imagine that this marriage would certainly give the prince wings. He was already a popular candidate for the throne. With such further assistance, ascending to the throne and advancing to the Foundation Establishment stage would surely be a certainty, wouldn't it? Thinking of this, the expressions of many cultivators in the hall immediately changed as they looked at the Fourth Prince. This was a future Foundation Establishment cultivator! If they pledged allegiance to him now, they would become meritorious retainers when he ascended. Many people's eyes immediately grew fervent.

The Fourth Prince, seated at the head, saw the change in everyone's eyes and displayed a heartfelt smile. His heart was filled with satisfaction! Because the reactions of the cultivators present were not beyond his expectations. This was exactly what he wished to see. After this bombshell news dropped, he believed that a large number of cultivators would soon pledge allegiance to him. His power would become unprecedentedly robust, and the succession to the throne would no longer be in doubt!

Gazing forward, the Fourth Prince seemed to already see himself obtaining a Foundation Establishment Pill and stepping into the Foundation Establishment realm. He seemed to already see himself embracing beauties and ruling the world. Foundation Establishment? No, that was not the end. His goal was Golden Core, a realm even further beyond, a distant and unreachable immortality. He wanted to obtain all of this! At this moment, the Fourth Prince's ambition was greatly satisfied.

But at this moment, an untimely voice rang out: "A bunch of stray dogs, yet you treat them like treasures, how ridiculous!"

As soon as the words fell, the main hall instantly fell silent. Then.

"Who is it?"

"Who's so audacious?"

Exclamations of surprise rose as everyone was astonished. Someone dared to mock them at such a crucial moment? Not even a great master at the tenth level of Qi Condensation would dare, would they? When everyone followed the sound and looked over, they saw a burly man dressed in black, holding a stunning young woman in his arms. This person was precisely the cultivator who had first pulled a hall maiden into his embrace at the beginning of the banquet. He sat casually on the ground, one hand lightly caressing, making the stunning maiden gasp for breath. Facing the unified stares from the hall, he acted as if nothing was amiss, continuing to enjoy the beauty, food, and wine. But the woman in his arms, upon hearing his words, was already paralyzed with fear. Her previous charm was gone; her beautiful face was deathly pale, her body trembled incessantly, and cold sweat dripped to the ground, forming a puddle.

The Fourth Prince's face grew cold, his eyes filled with icy killing intent, as he stared fixedly at the man. He hadn't expected, truly hadn't expected, that someone would say such a thing! Someone dared to disrupt the atmosphere he had meticulously crafted? To publicly slap his face like this, if he didn't do something, how could he ever face the world again?

"Who are you?" the Fourth Prince asked in a cold voice, his gaze like a knife, enunciating each word. Unconcealed killing intent surged forth, making many people in the hall clench their hearts. The atmosphere grew heavy.

The burly man in black acted as if he hadn't heard, still pouring himself a cup of spiritual wine and leisurely drinking it. Seeing that the other party completely disregarded him, the Fourth Prince's rage became uncontrollable. He abruptly stood up and ordered, almost grinding his teeth: "Kill him!"

The great master at the tenth level of Qi Condensation, who was seated to his left, immediately made a move. A dazzling golden light burst forth, streaking towards the black-clad man like lightning.

"So strong!"

The moment this person attacked, the hearts of the Qi Condensation cultivators in the hall all tensed. A tenth-level Qi Condensation cultivator's strike was indeed extraordinary; this aura truly made it difficult to conceive of resistance.

"This person will be easily cut down, won't they?" some people subconsciously thought after seeing the might of the golden light.

But.

"Splat!"

The burly man in black remained calm. He didn't even look at the light. He merely casually slapped the table, and a chopstick shot out with a "whoosh," hitting the golden light in the blink of an eye.

"Boom!"

A deafening roar erupted, and then the dazzling golden light was instantly shattered, flying backward. This was followed by a heart-wrenching scream.

The great master at the tenth level of Qi Condensation turned deathly pale, his eyes filled with terror and disbelief as he stared at the bloody hole in his arm. His scream was not merely due to pain, but more so from fear. Unbelievable! Not only could he not believe it, but no one else in the hall could either! The crowd was stunned. In an instant, the hall became terrifyingly silent; no one could make a sound.

The black-clad man slowly drank a cup of wine. When he saw the woman beside him trembling with fear, he shook his head and said, "Boring!" As his words fell, a staff-like black banner, as tall as a man, suddenly appeared behind him. A ferocious ghost head on the banner's surface let out a cackle, opened its large mouth, and swallowed the woman whole. A chilling, terrifying aura immediately enveloped the entire hall. Everyone heard mournful wails in their ears, a sound that made them dizzy, numb all over, and their spiritual power scattered and unable to gather.

"Foundation Establishment! A Foundation Establishment cultivator!" The tenth-level Qi Condensation expert seemed to have only just reacted, letting out a terrified cry.

Fear instantly swept through the entire palace. The moment the long banner appeared, Mo Changzong's eyes immediately filled with terror, and his entire body began to tremble. Mo Qingchan's face was ashen, one slender, jade-white hand gripping the table tightly. They were very familiar with this long banner; one could even say it was their nightmare. The leader of the Black Robe Society! The burly man in black was actually him?!

The atmosphere became deathly silent, pairs of eyes, filled with horror, stared fixedly at the black-robed man, at the long banner.

"Bang!" A crisp sound broke the silence. The black-clad man kicked over the jade table in front of him and stood up.

"Mo family remnants, Wei family princes, you're all gathered together. It saves me the trouble of finding you one by one!" he declared. "So much nourishment! My Soul Banner can transform again, hahahaha!"

Seeing the terrified expressions of the crowd, the Black Robe Society leader stopped pretending, revealed his true appearance, and laughed wildly. The long banner was in his hand, and a tall, malevolent ghost floated unstably beside him, making him appear terrifyingly demonic.

Flee! Seeing this scene, the Qi Condensation cultivators were utterly terrified and scattered in all directions.

"Hmph! You think you can leave in front of me?" The Black Robe Society leader sneered disdainfully and shook the long banner in his hand. In an instant, a black mist surged out from the long banner, swirling and spreading with lightning speed, completely enveloping the entire palace in mere moments.

The thick black mist swirled, inverted to form a colossal dome, enveloping all the cultivators within it. Those Qi Condensation cultivators who rushed into the black mist let out a shriek and then immediately fell silent.

"There's no escape!"

"What do we do? He wants to wipe us all out!"

"Don't panic! Kill him! Can one person really fight against all of us?" Terrified roars echoed from the ground.

Facing a Foundation Establishment cultivator, no one was unafraid. But when they saw that the other party left no way out, the ferocity in their hearts was also ignited. Immediately, hundreds of dazzling lights fiercely bombarded the Black Robe Society leader. A dense array of various attacks immediately filled the great hall, overwhelming the sight with shimmering lights of all colors, as if stars had fallen.

But facing this grand and destructive assault, the Black Robe Society leader's expression remained calm: "If numbers were useful, what would be the point of us painstakingly cultivating to Foundation Establishment?" He waved the long banner in his hand, and immediately another thick black mist surged out, forming a wall of mist that blocked in front of him. When the hundreds of lights struck, they all felt like they had hit a ball of cotton, soft and completely without force.

"How is this possible?" Seeing this, the Qi Condensation cultivators' faces instantly turned pale. Their combined attacks, from so many people, were actually stopped so easily by the opponent?

"Whoosh!" A black mist swept over, rapidly enveloping the Wei family's tenth-level Qi Condensation master. Inside the black mist, a massive malevolent ghost opened its large mouth, and the Wei family's Qi Condensation Grand Completion expert was swallowed whole without any power to resist. This highest-cultivation expert died silently just like that.

The Fourth Prince's face was ashen, and his entire body trembled. Fear and the threat of death had never been so close to him. The tenth-level Qi Condensation expert was just a short distance from him earlier. He watched with his own eyes as the other party was devoured; this scene was too impactful for him.

The malevolent ghost was not satisfied after devouring a Qi Condensation Grand Completion cultivator. It cackled, turned its head, and looked at the Fourth Prince. It had two horns on its head, a pair of blood-red eyes like two red lanterns, and a gaping mouth like a black hole. Its bone-white teeth gleamed with sharp light, and foul-smelling drool dripped from the corners of its mouth.

His legs trembled, and the Fourth Prince nearly collapsed to the ground. But he was not merely an outwardly grand but inwardly rotten figure. Despite extreme fear, he struggled to maintain his composure. With a slap of his storage bag, several life-saving methods appeared in his hands.

"Whoosh! Whoosh!" He consecutively threw two Fire Thunder Pearls, which flew towards the malevolent ghost. The malevolent ghost merely cackled sinisterly, not dodging at all, and directly swallowed both Fire Thunder Pearls with its large mouth. The Fire Thunder Pearls entering the malevolent ghost's mouth were like mud oxen plunging into the sea, not even a ripple was created, and they vanished without a trace.

The Fourth Prince, seeing this, gritted his teeth, flipped his hand, and a talisman covered in mysterious purple patterns appeared. He frantically poured his spiritual power into the talisman to activate it.

"Boom!" A purple bolt of lightning descended, carrying a terrifying and intimidating aura, striking the malevolent ghost fiercely.

"ROAR!!!" A beast-like roar erupted. After being struck by the lightning, the malevolent ghost's form nearly disintegrated. A fierce, malevolent light immediately surged in its blood-red eyes.

"Heavenly Thunder Talisman? To actually be able to produce such a talisman, interesting!" the Black Robe Society leader said with some surprise upon seeing this.

"It's injured! Quick, attack together! Only then do we have a chance!" the Fourth Prince hastily shouted, urging everyone to attack again. In an instant, hundreds of lights shot up again, bombarding the Black Robe Society leader.

"Ants trying to shake a tree!" The Black Robe Society leader sneered, not bothering to put these attacks in his eyes at all. He pointed a finger, and the malevolent ghost's form solidified again, opening its mouth and charging towards the Fourth Prince.

But at this moment.

"Whoosh!"
"Whoosh!"

Suddenly, among the hundreds of attacks that the Black Robe Society leader had dismissed, three beams of light surged with immense power. A powerful and terrifying aura suddenly erupted from those three artifacts, piercing through the black mist barrier with lightning speed and reaching the Black Robe Society leader. With a twist of the three lights, the Black Robe Society leader's body was instantly shredded, a pool of blood and flesh falling to the ground. Almost at the same instant, the clawing, fanged malevolent ghost's movements suddenly froze, and it stood still, unmoving. Then, it dissipated into a wisp of black smoke.

"Thud!" The long banner dropped to the ground, the black mist dispersed, and the palace's magnificent ceiling reappeared before everyone.

The situation changed drastically! The Black Robe Society leader, who had been arrogant beyond compare just moments ago, had died just like that! This sudden change left everyone stunned. It wasn't until three figures in the crowd erupted with powerful auras, their appearances gradually transforming into different visages, that the group finally reacted.

"Imperial Father?!" The Fourth Prince exclaimed in surprise, recognizing one of the figures as his Foundation Establishment father. This figure had a solemn and dignified appearance, commanding respect without anger, giving the impression of someone long accustomed to high positions. Emperor Wei! The nominal ruler of the Wei Kingdom, and also a late-stage Foundation Establishment master. To his sides were a white-haired elder and a smiling middle-aged man.

"They are Wei family Foundation Establishment masters!"

"Are they ambushing the Black Robe Society leader?"

"This was a setup?" Exclamations of surprise rose from the crowd.

Seeing this scene, everyone now understood; it turned out today's banquet was a trap specifically aimed at the Black Robe Society leader! But judging by the Fourth Prince's astonished face, it seemed even he wasn't privy to the details, was he? The Black Robe Society leader fell into the Wei family's trap and died! A generation's rogue cultivator leader, who had run rampant in the Wei Kingdom for over a hundred years, had met an unexpected end just like that.

"Good, serves him right!" Mo Changzong's face showed a mix of surprise and joy. "Many thanks to you seniors for acting and avenging this great enmity for our Mo family!" He hastily bowed, his posture utterly fawning. Not far from him, Mo Qingchan, however, frowned slightly, a hint of doubt in her eyes as she looked at the pool of blood and flesh.

"The three seniors' divine might is boundless, annihilating the Black Robe Society leader was as easy as turning their hand!"

"A mere rogue cultivator, how could he be a match for the Wei family's experts? Many thanks to the three seniors for slaying this demon and restoring peace to the Wei Kingdom!" Mo Changzong's words seemed to awaken everyone, and for a time, flattery poured forth like a tide, surrounding the three Foundation Establishment experts. Everyone was both surprised and delighted. The previous despondency and panic were swept away, and everyone became re-energized. To be able to feel the might of a Foundation Establishment expert's strike up close like this was also a kind of good fortune.

Just as a joyful atmosphere permeated the crowd, the Wei family's white-haired Foundation Establishment elder frowned, his expression somewhat unsightly as he said: "It failed!"

"Indeed, it failed. We originally wanted to catch him off guard, but we didn't expect his vigilance to be so high!" The middle-aged man shook his head regretfully.

Emperor Wei sighed and said to the cultivators who were effusively flattering them: "Gentlemen, don't rush. That fiend has not yet been apprehended!"

As soon as his words fell, a series of sinister cackles suddenly rang out.

"Whoosh!" The long banner suddenly rose and swiftly flew out of the hall.

"Boom!" The colossal palace collapsed with a crash. Dazzling sunlight streamed down, and when everyone looked up, they only saw thick black mist billowing in the sky. A figure stood within it, with a massive malevolent ghost rising and falling beside him, a chilling and terrifying aura emanating from its body. This was an aura many times more powerful than before, practically suffocating.

"What we just killed was merely a puppet avatar he controlled; its strength wasn't even one-tenth of his!" Emperor Wei's gentle voice rang out, explaining to the crowd. He appeared composed.

"Dao brother, it's best to surrender. Since you've entered this jar today, don't even think of leaving!" Emperor Wei flew into the sky, leveling with the Black Robe Society leader, and spoke calmly. The other two also flew up, and the three of them formed a triangle, surrounding the Black Robe Society leader. Although the sudden attack just now didn't kill him in one blow, under the encirclement of the three of them, there was absolutely no chance for him to escape.

"The Thousand Absolute Sect's plan to send you to disrupt our clan's scheme has long been detected by us. Your subordinates who infiltrated Tianmen City have now also been captured by us. Your plan has failed!" Emperor Wei stood with his hands behind his back, exuding the confidence of someone who had all the world's affairs under control.

"Hehehe!" The Black Robe Society leader let out a chilling cackle. "Wei Tianjing, do you really think I was completely unaware and blindly walked into your trap?" A hint of a smile played at his lips: "The one who fell for the trap isn't me, but your Wei family!"

As soon as his words fell, a brilliant red light suddenly rose from the horizon. The firelight swept in like a tide, extending for an unknown number of miles, overwhelming everything and instantly engulfing the entire sky. A scorching temperature emanated, making people feel as if they had instantly plunged into a furnace. Amidst the sky full of firelight, a figure as scorching as the sun appeared. An ancient voice resonated throughout the entire world: "Wei Tianjing, this old man has waited for forty years, finally waiting for you to come out of that tortoise shell!"

Emperor Wei's usually composed face finally revealed an expression of extreme shock. The Ancestor of the Thousand Absolute Sect! A Golden Core Perfected Being! The strongest expert of the Wei Kingdom had appeared!

"Whoosh!" As everyone was still immersed in the shocking spectacle of the sky filled with fire, a beam of light shot out rapidly, fleeing into the distance. Mo Qingchan! She was the first to react, fleeing for her life. This movement immediately alerted the other cultivators, and the crowd scattered like startled birds, the hundreds of people in the hall vanishing in an instant. The Fourth Prince's expression changed rapidly several times, and finally, gritting his teeth, he also immediately shot out without a word. His direction of escape was precisely the same as Mo Qingchan's.

Emperor Wei and the two Wei family Foundation Establishment cultivators did not move. Their faces revealed expressions of desperate, bitter smiles. This was because the massive divine sense in the sky had already locked onto them; they had nowhere to escape.

"Good heavens! Is this the might of a Golden Core cultivator?" Lu Xu, who had been hiding in the distance, waiting for the Fourth Prince to appear, couldn't help but exclaim in admiration when he saw the firelight that seemed capable of burning the entire world to ashes. Even from afar, he could still feel the scorching aura emanating from that blazing figure. A hot wind blew through the forest, the tender leaves withered, and the trees subtly showed a tendency to spontaneously combust.

He wasn't clear about what was happening at the manor. But when he saw the Black Robe Society leader suddenly appear in the sky, he realized that the situation had changed. Immediately after, the three Wei family Foundation Establishment cultivators and the Thousand Absolute Sect's Golden Core Ancestor appeared one after another, a truly dazzling display.

"I knew there would be a big battle, but I didn't expect it to come so quickly!"

"I wonder if the Wei family can withstand this calamity. They shouldn't repeat the fate of Qinghu Market, right?" Lu Xu murmured to himself, his gaze fixed on a green figure flying out of the manor. He hadn't seen the Fourth Prince before, but he had inquired about his appearance. The moment the Fourth Prince flew out, he immediately recognized him. The other party wasn't very far from him, about several tens of *zhang* away.

Lu Xu hid in the tree canopy, watching the Fourth Prince with full concentration, and quietly whispered in his heart: "Check martial arts experience!"
