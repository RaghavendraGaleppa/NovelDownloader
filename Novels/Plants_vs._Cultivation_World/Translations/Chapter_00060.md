# Chapter 60: Absence  

It was the same familiar gathering spot. Gu Mo, Chu Feifei, Hu Hai, and Wu Jinfei chatted about the events of the past year. It had been three years since they joined their respective peaks, and by now, they had all passed the novice stage, gradually accumulating some resources.  

For instance, Wu Jinfei was proudly showing off a substandard magic sword he had forged himself using materials he had saved up over the years. Though it wasn’t a true ranked magical artifact, Wu Jinfei was still immensely satisfied. He firmly believed he would forge a genuine magical artifact in the near future.  

"When the time comes and we ask you to craft artifacts for us, you’d better give us a discount," Chu Feifei teased.  

"Of course!" Wu Jinfei thumped his chest with a loud thud.  

"By the way, why hasn’t Boss Yao arrived yet?" Hu Hai couldn’t help but ask. They had been waiting for quite some time, but there was still no sign of Yao Shifeng.  

"Maybe something came up?" Wu Jinfei guessed. He had been too busy showing off earlier to notice. Only in Yao Shifeng’s absence could Wu Jinfei strut his stuff in front of Gu Mo and the others. When Yao Shifeng was around, his presence completely overshadowed Wu Jinfei’s.  

Of course, Wu Jinfei had no idea about Gu Mo and Chu Feifei’s true capabilities—otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so eager to boast.  

"Let’s wait a little longer," Gu Mo suggested.  

Now that they no longer had to rush back to complete tasks, waiting a while longer wasn’t a problem. However, as time passed and Yao Shifeng still didn’t appear, the group grew restless.  

*Knock, knock, knock!*  

Just then, the door to the private room was knocked. But the visitor wasn’t Yao Shifeng—it was a servant disciple from the Talisman Peak. "Are you all Senior Brother Yao’s friends?" the disciple asked.  

After confirming their identities, the disciple handed them a letter. It was undoubtedly written by Yao Shifeng—they recognized his handwriting from previous correspondence.  

The letter was brief. Yao Shifeng explained that he couldn’t attend because he had reached a critical moment in his cultivation and couldn’t leave. He had sent the Talisman Peak junior to deliver the message.  

"A critical moment in cultivation!" Wu Jinfei’s heart stirred at those words. What counted as a critical moment? At the very least, it meant a breakthrough in cultivation.  

This implied Yao Shifeng’s strength had improved compared to the previous year. With that in mind, Wu Jinfei suggested they entrust this year’s investment to the Talisman Peak disciple to deliver to Yao Shifeng.  

The stronger Yao Shifeng became, the more important it was to continue their investment. If not for the fact that forging his substandard magic sword had left him short on funds, Wu Jinfei would have even proposed increasing their investment.  

The others had no objections—they had all prepared their contributions. They placed a hundred spirit stones into a box, and after Chu Feifei inscribed a basic anti-theft array on it, they handed it to the Talisman Peak disciple.  

With Yao Shifeng absent, the gathering was effectively over. However, as usual, Chu Feifei lingered until the end.  

"Here, this is your payment," Gu Mo said, handing her a bag containing thirty pounds of Water Spirit Rice—far exceeding the value of repairing his array disk.  

This wasn’t just payment for the repair; it was also an investment. From the way Chu Feifei had effortlessly inscribed the array on the box, Gu Mo could tell her mastery of formations had improved, and her cultivation hadn’t lagged behind either.  

Giving her thirty pounds of Water Spirit Rice would undoubtedly give her another boost. Gu Mo didn’t need the rice to speed up his own cultivation, so he kept only twenty pounds for himself to sample. Besides, in another six months, a new harvest of Water Spirit Rice would be ready.  

"This much?!" Chu Feifei’s eyes widened in shock at the sight of the thirty pounds of rice. She hadn’t expected Gu Mo to be so generous.  

To put it into perspective, even some ordinary inner disciples might only receive this much Water Spirit Rice. Of course, inner disciples had access to other resources, but due to its scarcity and high demand, even they didn’t get much.  

By giving her this, Gu Mo was essentially offering her the treatment of an inner disciple. How could she not be stunned?  

"It’s not much. I harvest three hundred pounds a year," Gu Mo said with a dismissive wave.  

His words made Chu Feifei swallow the protest she had been about to voice. Such blatant flaunting of wealth was downright infuriating.  

Since he was clearly loaded, Chu Feifei accepted the gift without hesitation. At most, she’d waive the labor fee next time he asked her to set up an array for him.  

"By the way, Gu Mo, I’ve reached the second level of Qi Refinement," Chu Feifei suddenly announced. His show of wealth had irked her, so she decided to flaunt her own progress, proving his investment wasn’t in vain.  

"What a coincidence—so have I," Gu Mo replied without missing a beat. He had long known about her cultivation level and wasn’t fazed in the slightest. Moreover, he revealed his "official" cultivation level as well.  

Yao Shifeng and Chu Feifei had both reached the second level of Qi Refinement a year ago. Now that Gu Mo had successfully cultivated Water Spirit Rice—an excellent cultivation resource—it was perfectly reasonable for him to display second-level Qi Refinement.  

"I’ll be breaking through to the third level soon," Chu Feifei quickly added, unwilling to be outdone. The second level had been her achievement a year ago. Thanks to her unique constitution, her progress was steady, and she expected to reach the third level within two or three years.  

If she could further refine her Cleanse Technique, the breakthrough might come even sooner.  

Seeing her determination to one-up him, Gu Mo played along, feigning astonishment. He couldn’t very well tell her he had already reached the mid-stage of Qi Refinement.  

Satisfied with her small victory, Chu Feifei finally took her leave.

**Talisman Peak**  

Yao Shifeng sat weakly against his bed, his expression haggard. To the outside world, he claimed to be in seclusion, but the truth was far grimmer—he was injured.  

For a long time, he had been consuming violently potent elixirs, pushing his meridians to their limits. Yet, to stay ahead of his peers, Yao Shifeng had never stopped.  

Then, a few days ago, during a cultivation session, his meridians finally gave way under the strain. The raging medicinal energy tore through them, and in an instant, his spiritual power surged out of control, dealing him a severe internal injury.  

Over the past few days, Yao Shifeng had struggled to stabilize the chaotic energy within him, barely surviving the crisis. But with his meridians shattered, his path forward was severed—unless he could obtain a rare meridian-repairing elixir.  

Such elixirs were exorbitantly expensive, far beyond Yao Shifeng’s means. In that moment, he was engulfed by despair.  

He had dreamed of rising step by step—from a servant disciple to an outer disciple, then an inner disciple. But now, it all seemed to be over.  

"No… it’s not over yet!" Yao Shifeng gritted his teeth, unwilling to accept defeat. A faint glimmer of hope flickered in his mind.
