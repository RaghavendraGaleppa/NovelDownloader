Chapter 583: Making a Move!

She spoke: "This place is the birthplace of the Great Yin force within my Heavenly Court. After billions of years, it has finally condensed into a Great Yin Fruit Dao Path. Now, the world is invaded by outer demons, transitioning from the ethereal to the corporeal. It is a pity..."

The Heavenly Empress left the rest unsaid. Once this Dao Fruit is taken, the Great Yin force of this world will never rise again.

Xu Yunfan understood this clearly. Even within the Taihua Spirit Void Realm, after proving a Dao Fruit, one becomes the master of that Dao lineage. All cultivators practicing this method and walking this path are merely tributaries.

But his focus was not on that.

At the core of the massive crystal wall, a treasure mirror the size of a palm, shaped like a moon wheel, neither gold nor jade, its material indiscernible, was slowly floating up and down.

It circulated water-like moonlight throughout its body. The mirror surface did not reflect external objects but contained a miniature rotating starry sky within, profound and mysterious.

It hung there quietly, gathering the essence and laws of this inverted mirror surface. It was the anchor that brought momentary peace to the chaotic Heavenly River, and the ultimate core concept condensed from the Great Yin Dao of this Heavenly Court.

The Great Yin Mystic Mirror Dao Fruit.

Normally, a Dao Fruit is formless and intangible, the embodiment of an ultimate law.

However, this world suffered a calamity unprecedented in eons. The Heavenly Emperor fell, the world's origin was severely damaged, and the Heavenly Dao's will, on the brink of collapse, acted out of self-preservation. Combined with the immense pressure and the erosion of foreign Dao laws from powerful existences like the Universal Salvation True Lord, the Heavenly Dao instinctively accelerated the condensation and solidification of this core law, granting it a physical prototype.

It serves as a final barrier to temporarily preserve the origin and block the probing of foreign Dao laws.

This was the treasure mirror before Xu Yunfan's eyes, the materialized Great Yin Mystic Mirror Dao Fruit.

"Fortune, a truly great fortune!"

Even though Xu Yunfan's will was as firm as iron, he couldn't help but breathe rapidly and his heart pounded wildly.

A Dao Fruit manifesting a physical form was naturally a treasure of the先天灵宝 (先天灵宝) level.

Even though the status of this Heavenly Court was lower than that of the Taihua Spirit Void Realm, a Dao Fruit is the ultimate embodiment of a Dao, making it extraordinary by nature.

He did not dare to be negligent, nor did he want this naturally formed Dao Fruit entity to trigger any unpredictable changes.

He immediately summoned a thick, heavy cauldron that was entirely crimson, its surface inscribed with countless intricate talismans, and exuded a惊人 (jīngrén) oppressive aura.

This was a Zhenyuan Refining Fire Cauldron he had specifically refined over the years to produce superior magic treasures. It housed many exotic fires, and with the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi poured into it, it could引动 (yǐndòng) fires of various elemental attributes for refining.

It possessed the power of suppression and absorption, and for now, it was barely usable to collect this innate spiritual treasure.

Xu Yunfan's magic power surged into the cauldron. The lid burst open, spewing out a crimson radiance that transformed into a massive vortex containing spatial sealing laws, enveloping toward the Great Yin Mystic Mirror at the core of the inverted mirror surface.

However, just as the radiance from the cauldron's mouth was about to touch the edge of the treasure mirror, Xu Yunfan felt a sudden stir in his heart. An extremely subtle sensation came from the Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner—it was the instinctual tremor of the Heavenly Empress Banner Spirit, carrying a trace of aura residue that shared the same origin as this Dao Fruit.

He abruptly halted his action, his mind racing.

This object is the manifestation of this world's final origin, condensed into a physical form under the driving force of the Heavenly Dao's will. What kind of connection will be formed if I take it?

Will it completely sever the connection with this world, or...

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with a sharp light. Without hesitation, he sent his divine sense into the Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner, directly communicating with the newly born Heavenly Empress Star Soul.

"If I take this Dao Fruit's physical form, what will be the consequences for this world?"

Inside the banner, the Heavenly Empress Star Soul's expression was calm, her eyes lowered.

Her voice came through the soul banner.

"Reporting to the Venerable One, this Great Yin Mystic Mirror Dao Fruit is, in a sense, the Heavenly Dao's attempt to preserve a sliver of vitality. It is the final fortress condensed from the core law of the origin."

"If the Venerable One were to completely take it, this fortress would crumble. Then, the remaining Heavenly Dao will of this world would lose its final shelter and be instantly exposed to the Dao realms of the outer True Lords, accelerating the process of its being partitioned and devoured."

She paused for a moment, glancing silently at Xu Yunfan, not daring to hide anything, and continued:

"However, because this fruit's physical form is the last Dao Fruit seed within this realm, if the Venerable One obtains its recognition, even with just a moment of contact, you will bear the last complete thread of this world's Heavenly Mandate, becoming the final Son of Fortune before the world's fortune dissipates."

Speaking of this, the Heavenly Empress's expression showed a hint of excitement, mixed with envy.

"Having the favor of the world's fortune, your actions within this world will be protected by the powers of Heaven and Earth, allowing you to avoid misfortune and seek good fortune. Your perception of opportunities will become incredibly clear, and the排斥 (páichì) of foreign Dao laws will also be weakened. However, you will also become the primary target for outer demons to窥探 (kuītàn), because once you bear the last great fortune of this world, you will be like a bright lamp in the dark under the洞察 (dòngchá) of their Dao realms."

Xu Yunfan sucked in a cold breath upon hearing this, a chill running through his entire body.

If he were to touch and take this Dao Fruit's physical form, he would likely be instantly注视 (zhùshì) by the Heavenly Dao's will of this world, which was on the verge of being completely overwhelmed by the many Golden Core True Lords from the Taihua Spirit Void Realm.

As an outsider, an invader, his aura was completely different from that of the native beings. Once his aura was captured and linked, it would be like lighting the most glaring eternal lamp in a pitch-black deep sea, instantly making him the most conspicuous live target on the entire battlefield.

At that time, the three True Lords—Universal Salvation, Clear Source, and Cavern Void—who were dividing the Heavenly Emperor's legacy in the heavens above, would likely sense that he had stolen the实体 (shítǐ) of this hidden Dao Fruit. They would immediately drop everything and联手 (liánshǒu) to tear him to shreds, grinding his bones and scattering his ashes.

Even if the three life-saving Golden Core Sword Intents bestowed by the Pure Yang Ancestor were immensely powerful, it would be impossible to withstand the furious strike of three True Lords in such a situation.

How should he take it?

The risk was immense. If there was even a slight miscalculation, he would likely lose this physical body.

He had to prepare for a soul exchange first.

As his mind raced, a steady voice came from the depths of the Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner. It was Zhang Ziyang, the Sect Master of the Dao Sect, who had voluntarily been拘 (jū) as a divine general banner spirit and hidden deep within the banner.

"Yunfan, you cannot directly touch this fruit. However, this Heavenly Empress's soul origin is extremely compatible with the Great Yin Mystic Mirror Dao Fruit. She was originally the bearer of this Heavenly Court, the one born to be closest to this Dao Fruit."

"如今 (jīnrú), her physical form has dissipated, and her spirit has fully entered the Star Spirit Banner, bearing its imprint. Her true spirit and consciousness have been completely twisted and restricted by the banner. To you, she feels only absolute reverence and obedience."

"More importantly, her current soul state has completely lost the final conditions needed to resonate with the Heavenly Dao and prove the fruit."

"If her soul power is used to take the physical form of this Dao Fruit, it can best conceal the aura, deceive the heavens, and minimize the final gaze of this world's Heavenly Dao and the commotion from the Dao Fruit itself."

"There should be no major trouble in the short term. The key lies only in..."

Zhang Ziyang's voice paused, his tone not fluctuating much.

"As long as you grasp her core true spirit imprint, firmly control the root of her life, and ensure she dares not and is unable to harbor the slightest disloyalty, this plan is可行 (kěxíng)."

Xu Yunfan was extremely surprised in his heart: "Sect Master, you actually came up with such a method?"

It was truly ruthless, treating a person as a bottle.

He had only been treating people as cups before.
