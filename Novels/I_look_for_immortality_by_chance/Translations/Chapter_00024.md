# Chapter 24: Fifth Layer of Qi Refining, Using the Stone Liquid Again

"Drip!"

"Drip!"

Within the clean and bright cave abode, wisps of spiritual energy lingered like mist, continuously swirling.

The concentration of spiritual energy here was no less than that of a second-grade upper-tier spiritual vein. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators could enhance their cultivation by staying here.

"Whoosh!"

Only such dense spiritual energy could nurture a "flood dragon."

On the emerald-green jade pillar, the flood dragon pattern seemed to come alive, its mouth opening and closing as if inhaling and exhaling spiritual energy. Meanwhile, silver droplets of liquid appeared out of thin air in the jade cup.

A faint spiritual light rippled through the quiet chamber.

All of this was witnessed by Gu Yuan.

As the spiritual light gradually took shape, he couldn't help but exhale deeply.

"After nearly a month, it's finally done!"

Since the day he forced Lan Tianlu to retreat with his imposing manner, Gu Yuan had not left his cave abode for even a step. He focused on cultivating, gathering spiritual energy, and carefully observing the formation of the "Spirit Flood Dragon Heavenly Water."

Fortunately, with the support of the second-grade array disk, the Spirit Flood Dragon Heavenly Water had successfully formed without any major mishaps.

Gu Yuan's cultivation had also reached the bottleneck of the fourth layer of Qi Refining. All he needed to do was consume the spiritual water to break through to the fifth layer of Qi Refining and unlock the spiritual sense barrier!

"However, before that, I need to temporarily deactivate the array disk, cut off the spiritual energy, and store the Four Spirit Jade Pillar in my storage bag."

Looking at the emerald-green jade pillar before him, Gu Yuan murmured to himself.

The Four Spirit Jade Pillar was extraordinary. It was forged from Chi Jade and supplemented with the essence blood of four spirits, simulating the environment for spiritual water growth. Because of this, like naturally formed spiritual water, the formation process could not be interrupted.

Once the previous batch of spiritual water was taken, the jade pillar would immediately begin forming the next batch. Once this process started, it could not be stopped or moved.

However, at this point, Gu Yuan could not find a spiritual vein capable of producing Foundation Establishment-grade spiritual water no matter how hard he tried.

Thus, after scouring through ancient texts, he found a clever method to temporarily seal the Four Spirit Jade Pillar. Once he found a suitable spiritual vein, he could release it again.

"Bang!"

"Bang!"

As Gu Yuan moved his hands, the array patterns in the cave abode dimmed. Moreover, the spirit-gathering array disk on the ground began operating in reverse, absorbing all the spiritual energy.

Within moments, all the spiritual energy in the cave abode vanished completely.

It was as if the spiritual energy had dried up in an era of decline.

The Four Spirit Jade Pillar immediately dimmed, all its radiance extinguished.

"Now!"

Gu Yuan's heart stirred as he channeled his spiritual energy to extract the "Spirit Flood Dragon Heavenly Water" from the jade cup.

Because all the spiritual energy had disappeared, the Four Spirit Jade Pillar became like a machine without power, completely motionless. Seizing the opportunity, Gu Yuan quickly stored it in his storage bag.

"Buzz!"

Once everything was done, the array patterns in the cave abode lit up again, and the spirit-gathering array disk released all the absorbed spiritual energy. The cave abode once again became shrouded in swirling spiritual mist.

"Next, it's time for the breakthrough!"

Gu Yuan closed his eyes to rest and meditate. Once he was fully prepared, he consumed the spiritual water.

……

……

"Boom!"

"Roar!"

It was as if thunder roared in his mind, or a flood dragon bellowed. Gu Yuan felt as if the entire world had suddenly brightened.

Though his eyes remained closed, the world unfolded clearly in his consciousness.

Spiritual energy, stone walls, array patterns—everything in the cave abode was revealed in minute detail, as if he were examining the lines on his palm. Even the tiniest cracks, as fine as strands of hair, were vividly clear.

Above, below, left, right—the entire space seemed to be under Gu Yuan's control.

He sat cross-legged on the meditation mat, yet all information within a six-zhang radius flowed toward him like a tide.

"Is this spiritual sense?"

A strange feeling welled up in his heart, and Gu Yuan couldn't help but marvel.

In the past, cultivators could be ambushed or caught off guard by hidden traps. But now, with spiritual sense, crude ambushes would no longer be a threat.

This was a small leap in cultivation.

"Especially for me!"

Feeling the surging, almost aggressive nature of his spiritual sense, Gu Yuan couldn't help but chuckle.

He felt like a flood dragon, soaring freely through the intangible expanse of the world.

"Bang!"

With a single thought, the flood dragon's tail lashed out, and cracks appeared on the cave's stone walls as if struck by a heavy object.

Ordinary spiritual sense could only be used for detection and was almost incapable of harming others. But Gu Yuan was different. His spiritual sense was like a vicious flood dragon—bold and domineering. It could not only affect the physical world but also directly invade an opponent's consciousness during battle, seizing the initiative.

With just his spiritual sense alone, it was equivalent to wielding a top-grade magical artifact!

Excited by his newfound ability, Gu Yuan experimented for a long time, only stopping when his consciousness was exhausted and the flood dragon grew weary.

"With spiritual sense, I've surpassed ordinary disciples of the Dao Academy. Even aristocratic disciples may not be able to compete with me!"

Gu Yuan silently compared himself to others.

The spiritual sense barrier—the first major hurdle in cultivation!

The more brilliantly one overcame this barrier, the greater the rewards.

If he were to fight Lan Tianlu again now, Gu Yuan could unleash his spiritual sense and render Lan Tianlu unable to even cast a spell seal before being defeated.

Even if Lan Tianlu had also broken through to the fifth layer of Qi Refining, as long as he hadn't used top-grade spiritual water, he would naturally be at a disadvantage against Gu Yuan.

In other words, with spiritual sense, Gu Yuan had finally made up for the shortcomings of his past life in the Green Wood Sect and could now rival the disciples of the Green Peak Dao Academy.

"However, spiritual sense alone isn't enough. I still need more trump cards to feel confident in future battles."

"By my calculations, the stone liquid should have accumulated enough by now. How should I use it?"

After his breakthrough, Gu Yuan did not become complacent. Instead, he examined himself to seek further advantages.

His greatest reliance and confidence naturally lay in the stone liquid.

One could say that his current status in the Dao Academy and his breakthrough in spiritual sense were both achieved thanks to the stone liquid.

Thus, his first thought was of the stone liquid.

"Given my current situation, the stone liquid should be able to reveal two paths."

"First, of course, is the opportunity to become a disciple. If this succeeds, conflicts will greatly diminish. If I'm fortunate enough to become a disciple of a Golden Core cultivator, all worries will vanish, and I can cultivate in peace."

"Second, there are spell seals, magical artifacts, spiritual materials, and the like. Since I have the Spirit Flood Dragon Heavenly Water, this might align with an opportunity and reveal something."

These two paths—one seeking power, the other seeking self-improvement—represented entirely different directions for opportunities.

At the moment, Gu Yuan could only choose one to explore.

This left him somewhat conflicted.

"Ah, forget it. A man without dreams is no better than a salted fish."

"Last time, I chose the cave abode because the opportunity couldn't be missed. But now, under the protection of the Dao Academy's laws, I should still have some peaceful days ahead. Might as well take a gamble!"

After careful consideration, Gu Yuan finally made up his mind.

He would seek the opportunity to become a disciple!

If he was lucky enough to become a disciple of a Golden Core cultivator, it would be a stroke of incredible fortune!

This was for the sake of the bigger picture—not at all about relying on others!

"Don't let me down!"

Taking a deep breath, Gu Yuan took out the grayish-green stone bottle and dripped the stone liquid into his eyes.
