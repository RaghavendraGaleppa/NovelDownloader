Chapter 67: All Martial Arts Under Heaven, Executing One Man Together

On the second day of the second lunar month, the Dragon raised its head.

Another three years had passed since Lu Yang’s visit to Wang Boyuan. Over these three years, he had successively met with other Martial Dao Heavenly Beings. Some were benevolent, some were ferocious, and he even exchanged blows with the more combative ones. However, Lu Yang’s gains were equally substantial. He finally gained a deeper understanding of the so-called fourth step of the Martial Dao, 'Investigating the Transformation of Heaven and Man.' His originally dormant mind became incredibly active at this moment, and his entire body’s vital energy seemed as if it would burst forth. It was a marvelous experience.

That night, the moon was dark, the wind was high, and stars were scattered across the sky. The usually brightly lit streets and alleys were, for some unknown reason, quiet tonight, with many households having their doors and windows tightly shut. The vast Tianjing City seemed rather deserted. On the dark street, only Lu Yang walked alone.

“This path of Heaven and Man is quite interesting…”

Lu Yang’s expression was calm as he silently comprehended the flow of his vital energy, feeling that at this moment, his vital energy was incredibly nimble, as if it had gained life!

“Investigating the Transformation of Heaven and Man, this step actually involves two layers of change. The first layer, ‘Transformation of Man,’ is to achieve a perfect unification of the martial artist’s vital energy and spirit. The second layer, ‘Transformation of Heaven,’ is to allow the vital energy and spirit within the body to resonate with the vast Heaven and Earth outside…”

The more Lu Yang contemplated, the stronger his state became.

Whoosh whoosh——

Just then, a blade light suddenly shone from the darkness. The blade light was dazzling, instantly illuminating the street and alley, its beauty surpassing all light between Heaven and Earth!

Clang clang!

The next second, streaks of golden light burst forth around Lu Yang, successively enveloping his entire body, as if a golden bell had firmly protected him within. The blade light landed on the golden bell, exploding into clouds of hot air and dazzling sparks. It then broke through three layers of golden light, only barely being stopped by the final layer. Seeing that his strike had failed, the attacker showed no hesitation, immediately withdrew his blade, retreated, and vanished back into the darkness.

Boom!

No sooner had the attacker’s figure retreated than a brilliant sword qi struck the spot where he had been, instantly cleaving a deep chasm into the ground.

“I wondered who it was, so it’s Daoist Ding.”

Lu Yang raised his head and smiled slightly: “It’s been a year, and Daoist Ding’s Demonic Blade seems to have improved further. To think it could break through four of my talismans.”

After speaking, he glanced at the weapon the attacker had just used against him: a curved blade shaped like a crescent moon, radiating power like a flying rainbow, yet imbued with a deep demonic nature that made one almost succumb to it with a single glance. For the attacker to break through his protective talismans, this curved blade accounted for seventy percent of the contribution.

“The Exiled Immortal, Di Shitian…”

Ding Feiying’s gaze was calm, but his tone held a hidden fanaticism: “Ji Xiongjing said you are a true immortal of this era. If I can slay you, my blade technique will surely achieve great perfection!”

Lu Yang shook his head with a laugh: “For Daoist Ding to rely on just himself, it’s a bit overestimating your own abilities.”

“If one person can’t do it, what about seven?”

As his voice fell, figures emerged from the darkness once more. Leading them was none other than 'Martial Suppression King' Ji Xiongjing. This Martial Dao Heavenly Being’s gaze upon Lu Yang was utterly covetous, as if he wanted to devour him alive, instilling a chilling sense of dread in anyone who saw it. Following him was the slovenly-looking 'Saintly Heart Scholar' Wang Boyuan.

In addition, the street and alley where Lu Yang stood were blocked off both in front and behind. They were a monk with a sorrowful countenance and a Daoist holding a whisk.

From Hanging Temple, 'Misfortune-Relieving Divine Monk' Xuan Ku.
From Celestial Master's Mansion, 'Barefoot Daoist' Chang Qingjing.

Above the rooftops, the bright stars illuminated a tall, graceful woman in a white long dress, resembling a piece of beautiful jade, looking down.
From Hundred Flowers Palace, 'Bright Jade Immortal Fairy' Hua Xiangrong.

The last person was a burly, tall man wearing dragon-shaped arm guards. Although his attire was luxurious, it could not conceal the ruggedness about him.
From the rogue cultivators, 'Alliance Leader of All Under Heaven' Guan Qiankun.

At this moment, seven Heavenly Beings of the current Martial Dao had gathered, surrounding Lu Yang within this street and alley. Outside the alley, the faint clatter of armor could be heard. It seemed even the Imperial Palace Guards had been mobilized! All Martial Arts Under Heaven, Executing One Man Together!

“What a grand display.”

Lu Yang praised, his face still showing no hint of panic. Instead, he laughed loudly: “But you’ve come at just the right time. Today, this Immortal shall use your strength to shatter the void!”

As his voice fell, without waiting for anyone to speak, he directly threw a punch! The first to bear the brunt was 'Misfortune-Relieving Divine Monk' Xuan Ku of Hanging Temple. He proactively stepped forward to block Lu Yang, raising his hand to meet Lu Yang's fist. Then he saw Lu Yang open his fist, revealing the Sword Qi Talisman hidden in his palm.

Clang clang——!

A brilliant sword qi instantly burst forth, directly slashing at Xuan Ku's glabella. However, once the sword qi dissipated, a surprising scene appeared.

“Amitābha…”

Xuan Ku stood firmly in place, hands pressed together. His entire body’s skin had taken on a golden hue unlike that of ordinary mortals, and the roar of his vital energy within him surpassed that of great rivers. Lu Yang’s single Sword Qi Talisman had only just managed to pierce his glabella, causing a single drop of blood to roll down.

“Master Xuan Ku’s physique is indeed the strongest in the world!”

Ji Xiongjing was overjoyed at this sight and immediately called for everyone to attack together… Then he saw Lu Yang, unhurriedly, pull out a thick stack of talismans.

Ji Xiongjing: “…”

Rumble!

The next second, dozens, even hundreds of talismans scattered forth, emitting myriad colors and grand auras. The buildings in the street and alley caught in the onslaught were almost instantly reduced to dust. During this process, Lu Yang’s aura was continuously rising.

“Hahaha! It’s going to happen! This Immortal is going to succeed!”

He looked crazed, laughing incessantly: “Shattering the void… This Immortal has lived for over a thousand years, and today, I shall finally shatter the void!”

Amidst his laughter, the several Heavenly Beings felt their hearts stir. Shattering the void!? Since achieving the Heavenly Being realm, they had all believed that the path forward was completely cut off. But listening to Lu Yang's words today, could there be a new path beyond Heavenly Beings? Even the Yun Family Old Ancestor, who was currently observing the battle, showed a surprised expression.

“A new path? Impossible!”

The Yun Family Old Ancestor's thoughts raced, and then he disdainfully shook his head. The fourth step of the Martial Dao was something he had deduced and spread through Wang Boyuan. Therefore, he was certain that this was a dead end, with absolutely no path beyond it. How could there be a new path?

“He’s just trying to deceive people, trying to forge a new path? Too bad, with me here, no matter how you fabricate it, I can find the flaws in it. As long as there are flaws, you won't be able to cultivate this Saint's Theft! In the end, your true body will still have to walk out of that formation and obediently fall into my trap…”

Even so, the Yun Family Old Ancestor still felt something was amiss. It seemed this karmic entanglement was falling in a direction unfavorable to him.

“Fine, it’s better to kill this avatar of his as soon as possible, lest prolonged delays lead to complications.”

Thinking this, the Yun Family Old Ancestor immediately formed a hand seal, manipulating karma and sending his thoughts into the ethereal realm: “Do not delay, act immediately.”

Almost simultaneously, Ji Xiongjing, who had originally wanted to probe the so-called 'Shattering the Void,' suddenly had an epiphany. He then spoke decisively and calmly:

“Don't be fooled by him! What 'Shattering the Void'? It's merely an attempt to bewitch people. We seven are now all here, each wielding a divine weapon and arrayed in a grand formation. Let us slay him first, and then share longevity!”
