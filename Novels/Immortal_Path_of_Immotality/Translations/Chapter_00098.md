# Chapter 98: The Arrival of the Demonic Path

"Great Song Dynasty's Zixiao Sect core disciples Thunderstorm Child and Lin Fan present a string of purple-silver stone bracelets, wishing the Turtle Sage a prosperous birthday and longevity like the cranes!"

The crowd buzzed with discussion, all marveling at the Turtle Sage's immense prestige to have even the inland's great Zixiao Sect send representatives to congratulate him.

On the stage, the Turtle Sage nodded repeatedly, his eyes narrowing into slits from smiling, clearly basking in the glory. But in truth, he knew exactly how things stood. A major sect like Zixiao Sect had experts as numerous as clouds, with plenty of old monsters in their ranks—several Nascent Soul True Monarchs among them—who wouldn't spare a glance for a minor overseas rogue cultivator like him.

If not for his subordinates' timely discovery that Zixiao Sect's core disciple Thunderstorm Child was traveling in the East Sea, prompting him to hastily send an invitation, these people wouldn't have given him the time of day. Initially, he hadn't expected any gifts from Thunderstorm Child—the mere presence of someone from a major sect was honor enough. Material gifts were unnecessary formalities. Yet, to his surprise, these two disciples had presented such an extravagant gift.

Immediately, the Turtle Sage raised his hand, stroking his beard with a gratified expression. "Nephew, you're too kind. In my younger years, I once had a delightful conversation with your sect's Golden Core Elder Ge Ming, forming an unbreakable bond with Zixiao Sect. How is Elder Ge doing these days?"

Seizing the opportunity to climb the social ladder, the Turtle Sage chatted amiably with Lin Fan as if they were family, subtly hinting to the East Sea cultivators below that his connections were vast—even extending to Zixiao Sect's esteemed elders.

The audience naturally erupted in admiration.

Lin Fan, however, wore a puzzled expression, as if trying to recall which of Zixiao Sect's peaks had an Elder named Ge Ming. After all, in major sects like theirs, only Nascent Soul True Monarchs were granted the title of Elder. Earlier, one of the Golden Core stage cultivators offering birthday wishes—a Golden Core True Person known as Misty Fairy—hailed from the Rainwater Pavilion, a major sect in the South Sea comparable to the inland's three great sects, yet she was only called a Protector.

If a Golden Core cultivator could be called an Elder in Zixiao Sect, it could only be in the outer sect's...

Suddenly, Lin Fan seemed to recall something, though his expression remained hesitant. "Could you be referring to Elder Ge Ming, the manager of the outer sect's miscellaneous affairs division, responsible for procuring spirit beast fodder?"

The entire hall fell silent, so quiet one could hear a pin drop.

Every guest's jaw dropped in disbelief. The so-called Zixiao Sect heavyweight Elder Ge, whom the Turtle Sage had been boasting about for years in the East Sea, turned out to be nothing more than a procurement officer in the outer sect's menial affairs division, in charge of buying pet food!

The Turtle Sage's face froze in shock. A hundred years ago, he had briefly met Elder Ge Ming at an East Sea market. Upon learning his identity, he had hurriedly befriended him. At the time, Elder Ge had seemed busy with some large-scale procurement and had only exchanged a few casual words with him.

But how was he to know what the man actually did? It had been enough to impress the simpletons of the East Sea. Who would have thought that inviting Zixiao Sect's disciples would backfire, exposing the truth and humiliating him completely?

Yet, the Turtle Sage was nothing if not resilient. Having lived for centuries, he was thick-skinned and quick to adapt. With only a slight hint of embarrassment, he brushed it off with a laugh. "Haha, that's hardly important."

The crowd swiftly caught on, chiming in, "Yes, yes, not important at all."

Realizing it was best not to dwell on the matter, Lin Fan smoothly changed the subject. "The purple-silver stone bracelet was merely the first gift. I have a second one to present."

The Turtle Sage's awkwardness vanished, replaced by a renewed smile. He mused that while this core disciple might be blunt and lacking in social graces, his etiquette was impeccable. To present not one but two grand gifts!

"Nephew, please show us this treasure and let us all marvel at it."

Lin Fan bowed and rummaged through his storage pouch, producing a silver foil inscribed with Sanskrit script. "This silver foil is extraordinary—not only is it a high-grade magical artifact, but it also records a soul-shocking secret technique."

The crowd leaned forward, intrigued.

Lin Fan began recounting its origins. "This item originally belonged to Monk Xingtai, a somewhat notorious rogue cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage in Jiangdong. A few days ago, as I passed through Jiangdong, this monk targeted me, intending to kill me."

Growing animated, Lin Fan waved his fists. "How could I, with my meager Qi Condensation cultivation, simply wait for death? I fought back and ultimately triumphed against this terrifying Foundation Establishment expert! I now present this serendipitously obtained treasure to the Sage as a token of celebration!"

His words carried hidden implications. Many in the audience understood—this Zixiao Sect disciple had used the East Sea gathering to showcase his feat of slaying a Foundation Establishment cultivator while at Qi Condensation, aiming to bolster his reputation and standing within the sect.

Thunderstorm Child and Lin Shan, seated further back, exchanged glances. Watching Lin Fan preen at the center of attention, they thought, "Typical."

The Turtle Sage didn't believe for a second that Lin Fan had killed the monk, but he forced a smile nonetheless. "Ah! Nephew Lin Fan, truly worthy of being a core disciple of a great sect! To slay a Foundation Establishment cultivator at Qi Condensation—what heights will you reach at Foundation Establishment? Perhaps you'll stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us Golden Core cultivators!"

The other Golden Core True Persons present, out of courtesy, offered stiff praise, though few believed Lin Fan's claim. The gap between Foundation Establishment and Qi Condensation was vast—everyone present had climbed from the lower stages and knew the truth. 

Foundation Establishment cultivators could release their divine sense, fly on swords, manipulate objects telekinetically, and survey areas hundreds of meters away. How could a Qi Condensation cultivator match that? 

What? A minor divine ability talisman? 

Not only would a Qi Condensation brat lack such a treasure, but even Golden Core cultivators like them didn't possess such items! Few present could even perform minor divine abilities, let alone craft talismans of them!

After sufficient flattery to satisfy Lin Fan's ego, he finally swaggered back to his seat, thoroughly pleased with himself. Lin Shan and Thunderstorm Child subtly shifted away, lest anyone associate them with him.

Following this interlude, the gift presentations continued without pause, the Turtle Sage's enthusiasm undiminished. Having hosted several such East Sea gatherings, the organizers handled everything with practiced ease.

Yet, as the event neared its conclusion, an unexpected disturbance arose.

Three streaks of light shot across the sky—all at the Golden Core stage—arriving in unison as if timed perfectly.

"Hahaha! How could such a grand occasion proceed without us? We rushed here just in time!"

The guests set down their cups, sensing trouble. The Turtle Sage frowned—he didn't recall inviting these three—but rose to greet them. "Fellow Daoists, if you've come for my birthday celebration, please join us."

The trio's voices carried down, laced with mockery as they unleashed their Golden Core auras without restraint.

"Demon Path's Hundred Ghosts Sect Protector, Mo Yuxiao."

"Demon Path's Blood River Hall Protector, Yin Wuming."

"Demon Path's Black Lotus Sect Protector, Yan Yuanchun."

"We present this humble gift to the Turtle Sage—our deepest regards!"

With that, three bloody heads thudded at the Turtle Sage's feet.

The hall fell deathly silent.
