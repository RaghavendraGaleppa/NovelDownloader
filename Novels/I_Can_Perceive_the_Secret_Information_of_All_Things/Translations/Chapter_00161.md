# Chapter 161: Within the Jade Coffin  

The Green Lotus Fairy had entered the Green Lotus Mountain Villa and ultimately chosen Xiao Ji as the vessel for her nascent soul.  

By now, Xiao Ji was fully aware of the situation and had made some preparations. However, this was his first time facing a nascent soul cultivator capable of creating a private domain, and fear still lingered in his heart.  

"The Green Lotus Fairy isn’t a true orthodox cultivator—just a lucky opportunist who benefited from the fragments of the Nine Treasures. She’s a demonic practitioner."  

Xiao Ji knew there was no way he could refuse the Green Lotus Fairy.
