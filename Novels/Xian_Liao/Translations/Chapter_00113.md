# Chapter 113: The Jingyang Dao Domain

Seeing their dazed expressions, Zhou Qing suddenly unleashed a thunderous tiger roar, activating Soul Suppression while executing the Fierce Tiger Slaughter Scripture to thoroughly intimidate the trio.

However, as soon as his Tiger Robe manifested—

"Spirit cultivator!" 

The three men first appeared bewildered, then as if struck by some overwhelming stimulus, they actually broke free from the Soul Suppression and promptly self-destructed.

Zhou Qing's Indestructible Vajra Body automatically activated, forming a golden protective barrier over his skin that withstood the explosion's impact. Even so, he was left somewhat disheveled. An ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator would likely have been severely injured by such an explosion.

What puzzled him was why these three, who had been perfectly fine moments ago, would self-destruct upon seeing the Tiger Robe. Moreover, they managed to self-destruct despite his suppression of their qi and blood—unless they had specifically trained in self-destruction techniques, prepared for such a moment at all times.

The explosion was so powerful that it tore a massive breach in the cave's defensive barrier, allowing water to gush in. 

Cloud-Parting Palm!

Zhou Qing used the technique to manipulate the water flow and seal the breach. Soon after, the cave's defensive formation automatically activated, fully repairing the damage.

The explosion had obliterated everything, leaving not even a trace of their souls behind. 

"Do they view spirit cultivators as more terrifying than demonic cultivators?" Zhou Qing wondered.

Amid the scattered remains, he found their storage pouches, now mostly damaged. Using his powerful spiritual sense, he erased their imprints and emptied the contents: pills, magical artifacts, and jade slips containing information.

He first examined the jade slips with his spiritual sense. After a long while, he exhaled slowly.

He now understood that he was in the Southern Wilds, a vast region spanning hundreds of thousands of miles, with only one human city—Tianxuan City—which also served as a gathering place for rogue cultivators. The city had been established barely a century ago.

Beast Tides.

This was why only one human settlement remained in such a vast area. The greatest danger in the Southern Wilds came from demonic beasts, which launched massive attacks every decade, with an especially devastating one occurring every three centuries. These tides particularly targeted human settlements, especially cities.

Tianxuan City had survived solely due to its guardian, the late-stage Golden Core elder Tianxuan, regarded as the most talented human cultivator in centuries besides the legendary Jingyang Zhenren. The city itself had originally been founded by Jingyang.

Jingyang had established dozens of such cities, but only Tianxuan remained. As for Jingyang himself, he had vanished three centuries ago. In just a few decades, he had spread his teachings across this domain, briefly revitalizing the remnants of humanity and leading them in resisting the beast tides. But after his sudden disappearance, humanity's fortunes swiftly declined.

Many sects chose to preserve their strength by abandoning cities and establishing mountain sects, taking in mortals to train as cultivators. Scattered, they stood a better chance of survival, as beast tides tended to target large human settlements of over a thousand people.

Yet, each beast tide also presented opportunities—once it passed, the rewards could be substantial. However, the battles were always brutal. Since Jingyang's disappearance, only Elder Tianxuan had truly managed to protect a city.

Meanwhile, the demonic cultivators Jingyang had once suppressed gradually grew stronger, merging through ruthless competition into the Four Great Demon Sects. These sects were rigidly hierarchical and had absorbed many other traditions. The laws Jingyang had established were increasingly ignored.

The demonic sects operated like a crucible of survival—even inner disciples distrusted one another, and few ever obtained a personal demonic deity. 

Zhou Qing also learned why the three cultivators had chosen self-destruction: spirit cultivators were considered even more horrifying than demonic ones. Falling into their hands meant one's soul and flesh would be eternally enslaved, with no hope of reincarnation. By self-destructing, even if their souls perished, a wisp of their true spirit would remain in their life lamps in Tianxuan City. Though the lamps would soon extinguish, in the eyes of Southern Wilds humans, this meant they could still reincarnate rather than face utter annihilation.

With demonic cultivators, there was at least a chance to escape with one's soul intact, making immediate self-destruction unnecessary. But against spirit cultivators, capture meant eternal damnation—both body and soul would be enslaved. Spirit cultivators were also adept at puppetry.

The Southern Wilds were vast and perilous. The hundred-thousand-mile region known as the Jingyang Dao Domain was the only area Jingyang had mapped. Beyond it lay uncharted dangers even Golden Core elders dared not venture into.

Within the domain, humanity was not the dominant force. The current rulers were the White Moon Wolf Tribe, which had risen after Jingyang exterminated the former overlords—the Profound Sun Tiger Tribe, whose royal lineage carried the bloodline of the qiongqi.

Jingyang's brief reign had seen dozens of human cities flourish, earning him recognition as the domain's only true human sage. 

Mortals were the foundation of humanity's survival and the hope of the cultivation world. Without them, transcendent physiques—essential for reaching Golden Core—would rarely emerge. Even descendants of such physiques seldom inherited them.

Currently, the domain had five Golden Core elders, including Tianxuan, all with transcendent physiques. The other four were demonic cultivators. Foundation Establishment cultivators were exceedingly rare, hence their title of "Great Cultivators." 

Youthful-looking Foundation Establishment cultivators were usually demonic practitioners, as only they would expend qi and blood to maintain their appearance. Physical cultivators, being far less effective against beast tides, had nearly died out—only those with poor aptitudes pursued that path.

Though spiritual energy was abundant in the Jingyang Dao Domain, the decennial beast tides continually stifled human development. Without large settlements, survival in the wild was nearly impossible. Only a figure like Jingyang could quell both the tides and internal strife to allow progress, but such stability vanished with his passing.

The jade slips made no mention of the Mortal Domain.

"Elder Tianxuan..." Zhou Qing noted the name. A peerless genius among rogue cultivators, Tianxuan had studied under Jingyang and was now the domain's undisputed strongest. Yet even he could not replicate Jingyang's feats. Focused solely on his own breakthrough, he did little beyond safeguarding Tianxuan City.

Jingyang, however, had not followed the conventional Golden Core path, instead forging his own unique way—hence his unparalleled power. Zhou Qing knew what that path was, for he walked it too.

Jingyang had cultivated the Yin-Yang Treasure Vase, emphasizing offense. From the jade slips, Zhou Qing realized he had underestimated its killing technique—Yin-Yang Divine Light. Yet once a path was chosen, there was no turning back. His own Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace had its own advantages.

After absorbing this knowledge, Zhou Qing focused on refining the cave's core. Only then did he understand why the trio had discovered it—the concealment formation had been damaged. 

The three cultivators' combined wealth amounted to over a thousand low-grade spirit stones, including two mid-grade ones—far richer than Jingyang's stash in the Mortal Domain.

Zhou Qing began repairing the concealment formation, consulting Yuan Mingyue when needed. Now that he had ample spirit stones, he didn't hesitate to use the teleportation array, gathering questions to discuss with her in batches. Yuan Mingyue, having already deciphered the Mist Formation, easily unraveled the cave's original concealment mechanisms.

"Master, this is likely an Inverted Five Elements Formation, a powerful variant of the Mist Formation. But it requires spirit stones to fully activate," she explained excitedly. Each breakthrough in formation comprehension strengthened her spiritual sense.

With her help, Zhou Qing restored the cave's concealment. The cave couldn't be moved easily—it sat atop a spirit vein, which powered its functions. The cave also had spirit fields (though stripped of herbs), alchemy rooms, and forging chambers.

"Perhaps the Great Mulberry Tree could be transplanted here," Zhou Qing mused, considering the Demon Seed Rebirth Art. He also planned to craft robes to bring his allies over and develop the area. The resources here were abundant—if not for the beast tides, humanity would have thrived.

But Zhou Qing wasn't worried. The Mortal Domain was untouched by beast tides, allowing him to ferry resources back and accelerate the Dao Court's growth. With the ability to return anytime, Zhang Jingxiu's vigil was no longer necessary—he could be brought over as a laborer.

At the Fusion Realm, Zhang would still rank among the domain's Great Cultivators, though no longer the unrivaled "Number One Under Heaven" of the Mortal Domain. 

Pity the Jingyang Dao Domain wasn't ruled by humans. The current overlords were the White Moon Wolf Tribe—the same lineage as the wolf they'd slain.

...

"Jingyang Dao Domain? White Moon Wolf Tribe?" 

Under the great pine of Taihe Mountain, its branches massaged Zhou Qing's back like hands, making Zhang Jingxiu feel like an outsider. After years of cultivation here, he'd never received such treatment.

"Exactly. That wolf we killed had their bloodline."

Zhang's face darkened. "Wasn't it your idea?"

"Never mind that—take me there!" Eager to leave, Zhang pressed.

Zhou Qing agreed but warned him never to reveal the Mortal Domain. If anything happened to him...

Zhang solemnly swore an oath. A seasoned veteran, he understood the value of controlling a Mortal Domain.

Before leaving, Zhang wrote to Fu Song, claiming he and Zhou were departing for the Dao Court's "spiritual realm." He added, pityingly, that those below the Fusion Realm couldn't pass through the teleportation array—what a shame for his disciple Ruowang.
