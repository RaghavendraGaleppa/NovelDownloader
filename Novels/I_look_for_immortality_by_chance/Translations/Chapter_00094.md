# Chapter 94: Thousand Methods of Qi Refinement, Green Ginseng Foundation  

"Ocean Heart Pill, a superior ninth-level Qi Refinement elixir with a mild nature. Consuming it can increase three months' worth of cultivation."  

"Stellar Ring Pill, a premium elixir. Consuming it can increase half a year's worth of cultivation..."  

"Skygold Grass, a miraculous spiritual herb of the Qi Refinement stage. Consuming it can enhance spiritual awareness by ten percent. This herb can only be consumed once in a lifetime."  

"Golden Lotus, a rare variant of lotus with a dazzling, gold-cast appearance. Those cultivating the Lotus Seal technique can enhance their protective abilities by consuming it."  

"Time-Traversing Flower, a miraculous spiritual flower of the Qi Refinement stage. Consuming it is like crossing through time, greatly increasing cultivation speed and allowing one to rapidly reach the peak of the current realm. However, it must be paired with body-strengthening elixirs to protect the meridians, or the surging spiritual energy may burst the body. Extreme caution is advised."  

"Bodyguard Pill, this elixir temporarily strengthens the body, protects vitality, and maintains unbroken meridians."  

"Barrier-Breaking Pill, consuming this pill generates a divine light around the body, shielding it from miasmic and demonic clouds."  

"Spiritual Dew, consuming it enhances vision, allowing one to see through illusions and miasmas..."  

"..."  

The list contained numerous rare elixirs and treasures, each tailored to Gu Yuan's current needs. With these precious herbs and treasures, he could rapidly accumulate spiritual energy, reaching the peak of the ninth level of Qi Refinement and saving years of arduous cultivation.  

The remaining elixirs and treasures, though not directly enhancing spiritual energy, were highly effective against demonic miasmas—clearly prepared for entering the secret realm.  

"As expected of a great aristocratic family, their resources are indeed vast. In that case, I won't hold back..."  

Gu Yuan chuckled lightly and, instead of picking and choosing, added three words beneath Bian Chuyao's instruction to "choose for yourself":  

"I'll take them all!"  

He then infused the golden sword with a surge of spiritual energy, opened his cave's formation, and let the sword return the way it came. Afterward, he closed his eyes and waited in silence.  

---  

"Wow! Young Mistress, this guy has no shame! You told him to pick, and he actually wants everything!"  

"Shameless! Shameless!"  

On Yunxuan Island, four flower spirits gathered around, spitting curses as they read the bold, greedy words on the golden sword.  

But Bian Chuyao merely smiled faintly, utterly unbothered.  

"As long as he agrees, it's fine. Mere worldly treasures—I, Bian Chuyao, have plenty!"  

Her voice was soft, but her tone carried unshakable confidence.  

This was how aristocratic families operated. Aside from critical strategic resources, any elixirs or treasures that could be bought with spirit stones were trivial matters.  

"As long as we retrieve the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit, giving him everything is no issue."  

Bian Chuyao clapped her hands lightly, and a group of mermaid attendants filed in, retrieving various spiritual herbs and elixirs from the treasury and placing them in a storage pouch.  

With a wave of her spiritual energy, the golden sword, now carrying the storage pouch and a thin letter, flew out of Yunxuan Island toward Jinyuan Island in an instant.  

The golden sword messenger could transmit not only letters but also storage pouches, and its speed was astonishing.  

However, this method was typically only usable within the sect's territory. Beyond that, more advanced techniques were required.  

---  

*Clang!*  

The golden sword arrived once more. Seeing the bulging storage pouch attached to it, Gu Yuan couldn't help but smile.  

Alongside the pouch was a thin letter.  

"All requested items are enclosed. I hope Senior Brother can reach the peak of the ninth level of Qi Refinement within a month and assist me in retrieving the spiritual fruit from the secret realm."  

"Aside from the fruit, all other treasures obtained in the secret realm shall belong to you."  

The letter contained only two simple sentences but imposed a strict deadline—Gu Yuan had to set out within a month to accompany Bian Chuyao to the Zhongshan Secret Realm.  

"Still, I've already consumed a Law Fruit. With these treasures, I can undoubtedly reach the peak of Qi Refinement within a month and even have time to acquire a Qi Refinement technique..."  

Gu Yuan weighed the storage pouch in his hand, retrieved its contents, and immediately began meditating to cultivate.  

---  

Twenty days later, Gu Yuan exhaled a long breath and opened his eyes, sensing that his spiritual energy could no longer increase.  

"I've reached the absolute peak of Qi Refinement. There's nothing left to refine—only foundation establishment remains..."  

The surging spiritual energy churned within him, causing his meridians and dantian to ache faintly.  

The Qian Yuan Cave was thick with spiritual mist, yet not a single wisp could be absorbed by him anymore.  

He had reached the absolute limit of this realm.  

To progress further, he had to refine his Qi into a foundation and step into a new stage.  

"But this final step is the true challenge..."  

Barefoot and clad in loose robes, Gu Yuan sat beneath the Giant Divine Wood and sighed deeply.  

In this world, foundation establishment was different—it required no elixirs, spiritual herbs, or magical tools.  

Instead, it demanded a Qi Refinement technique and a strand of "Heaven and Earth Qi."  

"Qi Refinement" did not merely refine ordinary spiritual energy. The most crucial element was the final step—refining the "Heaven and Earth Qi."  

The world contained many unique forms of spiritual energy.  

For example, "Mist Qi" was born amidst forests and water vapors. Refining it allowed one to establish a "Mist Foundation," granting ethereal, cloud-like spiritual energy that could summon mists and rain, riding the winds with ease.  

Within volcanic mountains, "Golden Flame Qi" was born—a fierce, yang-aligned energy that, when refined, formed a "Golden Flame Foundation." This foundation granted blazing spiritual energy capable of incinerating all things and melting rare ores.  

There was also Lunar Qi, Five Elements Qi, and countless others.  

The Qingfeng Dao Academy's major True Diagrams each corresponded to different "Heaven and Earth Qi" and different "Foundations."  

For instance, the Toad Moon Divine Light True Diagram refined "Lunar Essence Qi," forming a "Lunar Foundation." This foundation could condense "Moonlight Nectar," a miraculous substance capable of nurturing spirit beasts, awakening their intelligence, and enhancing their cultivation.  

The Five Elements True Wheel Diagram refined "Primordial Qi," forming a "Five Elements Foundation." This foundation could manifest a "Five Elements Wheel," suppressing all directions with immense sealing power.  

Each technique required refining different Heaven and Earth Qi, producing different foundations with unique abilities.  

The greatest distinction between Foundation Establishment cultivators and Qi Refinement cultivators lay in their foundations.  

Some foundations excelled in combat, others in cultivation, some in evasion, and others could even generate resources—each as wondrous as a divine ability.  

The Seed of Eternal Verdure True Diagram required refining "Greenwood Profound Qi," born in ancient forests and vast emerald seas.  

This Qi formed the "Green Ginseng Foundation," which could accelerate the growth of spiritual plants and awaken flowers and trees—a truly miraculous ability.  

Each True Diagram represented a different path to Foundation Establishment.  

However, Heaven and Earth Qi alone was insufficient for establishing a foundation.  

To refine it, one had to visit the Transmission Hall to obtain the subsequent technique—the Foundation Establishment method.  

This method was incredibly difficult to master, touching upon the profound mysteries of the Dao. Without great comprehension, grasping it was nearly impossible.  

Without understanding the method, even a thousand strands of Heaven and Earth Qi would be useless—one wouldn't even be able to sense this unique spiritual energy.  

The Dao was ineffable, and its profundity was most evident at the thresholds of breakthroughs.  

Understanding it meant the possibility of advancement.  

Failing to understand meant stagnation.  

This was one reason Gu Yuan had agreed to accompany Bian Chuyao to the Zhongshan Secret Realm.  

He desperately needed the Three Hearts Seal.  

"Still, there's some time left. I should first obtain the subsequent technique—perhaps I can comprehend the method on my own..."  

Gu Yuan calculated the remaining time, then rose and mounted his flying shuttle, heading toward the Transmission Hall.
