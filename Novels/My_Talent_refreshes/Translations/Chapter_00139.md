# Chapter 139: Instantly Killing a Foundation Establishment Strength Demonic Beast

Meanwhile, inside Xin Wuya's immortal cave.

He Litong looked at the slow-approaching elder in a green robe with white hair, a hint of surprise on his face. Still, he immediately cupped his hands and bowed, saying, "Greetings, Elder Yang!" As he took the lead, the other six Qi Refining disciples also bowed in unison. "Greetings, Elder Yang!"

"Don't call me Elder; I'm just a cripple now," the green-robed, white-haired elder waved his hand. This was none other than Elder Yang, who had previously not hesitated to destroy his Golden Core to preserve the sect.

Hearing Elder Yang's words, the disciples fell silent. They had witnessed Elder Yang's actions when the Yin Demon Sect attacked last time.

At this moment, Elder Yang's gaze fell upon He Litong. "Hand them all over."

"Elder, this..." Hearing Elder Yang's words, He Litong immediately showed a troubled expression.

"I know the Sect Master gave you instructions, but the sect is now in a life-or-death crisis. Even if the Sect Master were here, he would do the same." He Litong hesitated, then shook his head, saying, "Forgive me, Elder, but my master repeatedly instructed me before leaving to protect these few people at all costs, I..." Before he could finish, his face suddenly changed. At that moment, he felt an immense pressure descend upon him. This pressure was precisely what he usually only felt from Golden Core cultivators like Xin Wuya.

"Elder, you..." He Litong looked at Elder Yang, his eyes filled with disbelief. But the next moment, He Litong felt the pressure on him vanish as abruptly as it appeared. Elder Yang's voice then rang out again. "With just a sliver of cultivation remaining, I might not be able to do much, but dealing with you is more than enough. Don't force my hand." He Litong's expression shifted several times before he finally conceded, "As the Elder sees fit."

Elder Yang's expression remained unchanged as he glanced at the six individuals. "Where's the other one? I remember there was also a disciple named Chu Ning."

"I arranged for him to be in another stone room," He Litong replied. "He just heard some things happening outside; I'll bring him over now." Saying this, he immediately walked towards that stone room.

However, when He Litong opened the stone room and looked inside, he was suddenly stunned. "Where is he? Chu Ning!" He Litong called out twice, but no one answered.

Elder Yang slowly walked over. "What's wrong?"

"I clearly told him to stay in this stone room just now, but now he's gone," He Litong said with a grim expression, then, as if suddenly remembering something, he quickly explained to Elder Yang, "Elder, I haven't deceived you in any way."

"Earth Evasion Art." Inside the stone room, Elder Yang's gaze suddenly fell upon the ground.

"Earth Evasion Art?" He Litong's expression turned slightly unpleasant upon hearing Elder Yang's words. Clearly, he was greatly displeased by Chu Ning performing such a trick right under his nose.

"Before my cultivation was severely damaged, I could have found him with a single sweep of my spiritual sense. But now..." Elder Yang said, his brows furrowing slightly. "I'm just afraid the Yin Demon Sect has already figured out the situation, and if one person is missing, they might not let it go." Elder Yang then sighed. "Never mind, this crippled body of mine is useless anyway. Consider it leaving a glimmer of hope for the Sect Master."

He Litong looked at Elder Yang's words with some confusion. But then, his eyes suddenly widened. He saw Elder Yang's magical power fluctuate; the next moment, his head full of white hair instantly turned black. Following that, the wrinkles on his face slowly disappeared, replaced by a youthful countenance. And this face, He Litong was equally familiar with—it was Chu Ning's appearance.

At the same time, Elder Yang's aura, after a period of fluctuation, changed to that of late-stage Qi Refining. "You still have inner disciple robes in your storage bag, right?" While He Litong was still in shock, Elder Yang's voice rang out, also sounding incredibly youthful. He Litong immediately took out a set of ordinary inner disciple robes from his storage bag.

"Let's go. Once the Spiritual Qi of Rhyme is refined, even Nascent Soul cultivators won't be able to detect it. They won't have any doubts." After Elder Yang changed into the sect robes, he spoke as he walked out of the stone room. He Litong immediately followed him out.

Inside the immortal cave's main hall, the other six Qi Refining disciples showed no suspicion when they saw He Litong and the other person. They didn't know Chu Ning to begin with, so upon seeing He Litong emerge with someone, they didn't think anything of it. Immediately, the few of them followed He Litong out of Xin Wuya's immortal cave.

At this moment, the three Golden Core cultivators guarding the Azure Stream Sect had extremely grim expressions as they watched the sect-protecting grand formation steadily weakening. This time, the sect was already short two Golden Core cultivators to operate the formation. Although many Foundation Establishment disciples were filling in, the formation's power was still significantly reduced; they could only painstakingly defend and were utterly unable to launch a counterattack. Furthermore, the Yin Demon Sect was much better prepared this time, and the demonic flames of the Black Fire Vulture-Crow caused real damage to the sect-protecting formation.

"Mister Mu, Mister Zhu, do you really want to risk your lives for that spirit seed? They're just a few Qi Refining disciples. Setting aside whether they can even find the spirit seed, even if they did, with your Azure Stream Sect's strength, can you truly obtain it?" The Yin Demon Sect had just launched a fierce attack, and seizing this brief lull, the bald man who had participated in the spirit seed snatch two months ago, now on the back of the Black Fire Vulture-Crow, sneered repeatedly.

As soon as the Qi Refining disciples emerged from the immortal cave, they heard this voice echoing above the sect. Naturally, none of them were fools; their expressions subtly changed upon hearing these words. They immediately understood the true meaning behind what Elder Yang and He Litong had just said.

He Litong saw everyone's expressions and sighed, saying, "The Sect Master once ordered that you all must be protected at all costs. However, the demonic path is too powerful, and turning you over now is an act of helplessness. Take care of yourselves. I can promise on behalf of the sect that your families and relatives will forever be protected by the Azure Stream Sect." After saying this, He Litong glanced at "Chu Ning" and then transmitted his voice to the three Golden Core elders in the sky: "The seven Qi Refining disciples who obtained the Spiritual Qi of Rhyme are here. Please, Elders, decide."

The three elders, already feeling overwhelmed, heard He Litong's voice. They glanced down, then exchanged looks, seemingly communicating something via spiritual transmission. Finally, Elder Zhu, the one with the dark face, took out a sound transmission talisman and threw it towards the bald man. It turned out that the sect's restrictions blocked spiritual sense transmissions, preventing even their Golden Core cultivators from directly transmitting messages through the barrier.

The bald man watched the flying sound transmission talisman, a trace of doubt appearing on his face, but he still reached out and caught it. After hearing the content of the sound transmission talisman, a hint of smugness appeared on the bald man's face, and he muttered, "Hypocrites." With that, he waved his hand directly. "Go!" Instantly, the enormous Black Fire Vulture-Crow carried the Yin Demon Sect members away.

Seeing this scene, all the deacons and disciples within the Azure Stream Sect breathed a collective sigh of relief. Under the Yin Demon Sect's previous attacks, the Azure Stream Sect's protective grand formation seemed on the verge of collapsing at any moment. This had truly made everyone break out in a cold sweat. Having long heard of the Yin Demon Sect's notorious reputation, they were genuinely worried about their fate if the great sect were to be breached. However, at this moment, everyone was also somewhat confused as to why the Yin Demon Sect members had simply left as soon as they said they would.

Not only were they confused, but the Yin Demon Sect members were equally perplexed. On the back of the Black Fire Vulture-Crow, the thin, dark-skinned old man who had also been there before now asked the bald man, "Brother Xu, why the sudden departure?"

The bald man chuckled. "Those Azure Stream Sect people agreed to hand over a few Qi Refining disciples to us. But the condition is that we leave first, and then they'll hand them over privately. It'll also be troublesome for you, fellow daoist, to wait later at the place where you set up the Soul Summoning Banner last time. They'll send the people over soon."

"They don't want to get a reputation for failing to protect their disciples and have their sect's name dragged through the mud, do they?" The thin, dark-skinned old man let out a cackling laugh, his tone filled with mockery. "No wonder Brother Xu said they were hypocrites just now. But, Brother Xu, aren't you afraid they'll play tricks?"

"They wouldn't dare!" The bald man sneered. "We already have intelligence on which people obtained the Spiritual Qi of Rhyme. If they dare to play tricks, hehe..." "If it weren't for the Sect Master being in a critical period of cultivation and not wanting to cause too many complications, the Azure Stream Sect would have been destroyed. Even the other six sects in the Azure Gorge Mountain Range wouldn't dare say anything." The thin, dark-skinned old man heard this and let out another cackling laugh. "However, after this matter of the wood spirit seed, the other six sects will undoubtedly be very dissatisfied with the Azure Stream Sect. Otherwise, there wouldn't have been any movement from even the closest Wind Gorge during our two attacks. Once we get those Qi Refining disciples, we can then inadvertently spread the information..."

Upon hearing this, the bald man burst into laughter. "Excellent! Your method is better, fellow daoist. Let the Azure Stream Sect lose more than they gain by trying to be clever." In mid-air, the mocking laughter of the Yin Demon Sect members echoed.

*****

"This place is quite a distance from the Azure Stream Sect; there shouldn't be anyone else around anymore." Deep underground somewhere in the Azure Gorge Mountain Range, Chu Ning, enveloped in a hazy yellow light shield, stopped his flight.

After leaving the sect's grand formation, Chu Ning didn't dare to surface immediately. He was afraid of being detected by the Yin Demon Sect or Azure Stream Sect members in the air, so he used the Earth Evasion Art to travel a significant distance before finally stopping. Hidden approximately ten zhang underground, Chu Ning cautiously extended his spiritual sense outwards while simultaneously using the Spirit Sealing Art. His spiritual sense could reach over fifty zhang, a distance sufficient to detect nearby activity.

What brought Chu Ning a slight sense of relief was that his spiritual sense detected no cultivators nearby. Not even the aura of any living beings. This made Chu Ning relax a little, but he still didn't let his guard down in the slightest. He stayed underground for a short while longer, and simultaneously, he once again extended his spiritual sense to probe outwards, still finding nothing. Only then did Chu Ning truly relax. Holding a mid-grade defensive talisman in his hand, he used the Earth Evasion Art to break through the earth and emerge onto the surface.

The scene that met his eyes was not much different from what his spiritual sense had just perceived. Chu Ning was currently in a dense forest, surrounded by towering trees, and the spiritual energy concentration was surprisingly no less than that of the Azure Stream Sect.

"It seems I've veered off quite a bit," Chu Ning muttered to himself. If he had gone east from the Azure Stream Sect, that area was near the end of the Azure Stream Mountain Range, and the spiritual energy there could not possibly be this dense. He hadn't veered far enough west to be in that territory, so at this moment, there was only one possibility. He might have traveled a short distance towards the deeper southeastern parts of the Azure Gorge Mountain Range. Chu Ning had a rough judgment and naturally did not linger there.

He used the Illusionary Form spell to change his appearance. Although he still looked like an eighteen or nineteen-year-old man, his facial features were completely different. At the same time, he took out the clothes he had prepared earlier in Yanji Market from his storage bag and quickly changed out of his Azure Stream Sect inner disciple robes. Then, after discerning the direction, he flew towards the northeast on the wind.

Chu Ning didn't use the Wind-Chasing Shuttle. This was naturally due to his concern that he might not be far enough away, and if the Azure Stream Sect or Yin Demon Sect had people stationed nearby, flying into the air would lead to his discovery.

As he flew on the wind, Chu Ning released the puppet bird. Chu Ning's spiritual sense could now reach fifty zhang, but it was still inferior to that of the puppet bird. As for Little White Spirit, the little fellow's spirit was weak after consecutively using its innate divine abilities twice. Chu Ning fed it a spirit fruit, and it then burrowed into his sleeve. Originally, it would have been best for Little White Spirit to rest in the spirit beast pouch. However, Chu Ning still needed it to sense changes in spiritual energy to discern direction, so he let it remain outside.

He traveled forward for about eighty li. Through spiritual sense communication with Little White Spirit, Chu Ning learned that the direction he was heading indeed had sparser spiritual energy, and he secretly rejoiced.

But just then, Chu Ning's expression changed, and his steps paused slightly. Within the puppet bird's line of sight, an enormous demonic beast was lying prone directly in front of Chu Ning. The beast was only about a person's height but measured four to five zhang in length, appearing incredibly massive. Its entire body was covered in gray mud, and its faintly visible limbs beneath its body were exceptionally thick. Under its sharp claws, a large boulder was clutched, as if it had been inadvertently swatted during its slumber, and the boulder was now mostly pulverized.

Upon seeing this demon, Chu Ning vaguely guessed what kind of demonic beast it was, and his expression slightly changed. He quickly turned and was about to leave on the wind. But at the same time, the demonic beast's large eyes suddenly opened, glaring fiercely in Chu Ning's direction. The next moment, its massive body quickly straightened up and charged rapidly towards Chu Ning. And now, the demonic beast that had originally seemed to be only a person's height, after standing up and running, was actually more than two people tall. Its enormous body was still dozens of zhang away, but the strong, heavy aura it emitted was already sensed by Chu Ning.

"A second-tier demonic beast, an Iron Rock Beast!" Within Chu Ning's spiritual sense range, he quickly sensed the true identity of this demonic beast, and his expression suddenly changed slightly. A second-tier demonic beast was equivalent to a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator. Moreover, this demonic beast had astonishing defensive capabilities, making it difficult for ordinary attacks to cause it harm.

In a flash of thought, a black dagger suddenly appeared in Chu Ning's hand. Since he knew that continuing to fly forward would take him closer to the outer reaches of the Azure Gorge Mountain Range, the demonic beasts there should logically be of lower tier. To avoid lingering in this area, Chu Ning immediately resorted to his ultimate trump card.

Soon, the enormous Iron Rock Beast appeared within Chu Ning's line of sight. Its two eyes, gleaming with green light, became even more ferocious upon seeing Chu Ning's figure. But the next moment, this second-tier demonic beast suddenly slowed its steps. The beast's instinct made it sense a trace of danger and unease. A second-tier demonic beast already possessed considerable intelligence; its large eyes fixated on the black dagger in Chu Ning's hand, seemingly understanding the source of the danger instantly. A flicker of fear immediately crossed its gaze.

But it was already too late. Chu Ning raised his hand, and the black dagger transformed into a streak of black light, shooting straight forward. Instantly, the black light pierced through the Iron Rock Beast's head. What slightly surprised Chu Ning was that the Iron Rock Beast was still running forward.

"This..." Greatly alarmed, Chu Ning's hand produced various talismans and magic tools.

"Bang!" Just then, the Iron Rock Beast's massive body heavily crashed onto the ground. It turned out that the demonic beast had died too quickly, and its body was still moving forward due to inertia.

Seeing this, Chu Ning finally calmed down. Without much hesitation, Chu Ning quickly darted forward, swiftly picked up the black dagger, and returned it to his storage bag. Then he collected the Iron Rock Beast's corpse into his storage bag. A second-tier demonic beast's corpse was a treasure. Chu Ning didn't have time to process it now, but he wouldn't just leave it there.

After completing all this, Chu Ning prepared to leave immediately. However, when he took out the puppet bird's control mirror from his storage bag again, he suddenly froze. He saw that where the Iron Rock Beast had been lying, a small body was now wriggling. Its form was identical to the Iron Rock Beast, but its size was more than ten times smaller.

"An Iron Rock Beast cub?" Chu Ning vaguely guessed something and swiftly flew over on the wind. Upon closer inspection, it was indeed a tiny Iron Rock Beast, appearing as if it had just been born, its eyes still closed.

At this moment, Little White Spirit also peeked out from Chu Ning's sleeve, curiously observing the small demonic beast on the ground. Seeing this, Chu Ning smiled and said to Little White Spirit, "Little White, how about taking this little guy with us to keep you company?"

"Ying!" Hearing Chu Ning's words, Little White Spirit let out a cheerful sound. Chu Ning then smiled, took out a spirit beast pouch from his waist, and directly put the small Iron Rock Beast into it. Then, his figure flashed, and he continued flying forward. In the blink of an eye, he vanished.
