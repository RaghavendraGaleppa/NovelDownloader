Chapter 102: The Bell of the Casting Hall

Zhan Yan turned his head, looking at Xu Yunfan with a kind expression. "Good disciple, since you wish to learn forging, I shall personally forge a weapon for you. Even if it isn't a Treasure Artifact, it will definitely be at the Sharp Edge level!"

"Thank you, Master!"

Xu Yunfan was overjoyed. If he could truly forge a Treasure Artifact, a weapon capable of generating blade qi on its own, his martial prowess would rise to another level.

The Golden Cudgel, a divine weapon, was too conspicuous every time it was swung, and each use placed a significant burden on his body. If he had a Treasure Artifact that perfectly suited him, his strength would naturally increase greatly.

The Casting Hall Master, Zhan Yan, preparing to accept a direct disciple, quickly spread throughout the entire Sky-Engineering Cave. The nine peaks and six divisions of the Sky-Engineering Cave mostly received the news.

"That old stick has finally opened his mind?"

In the Mechanism Hall, a short, stout old man with white hair and beard expressed some surprise. His left arm was fitted with a bronze prosthetic, and with his movements, the bronze arm made the sound of gears and levers turning.

In the Hidden Edge Pavilion, several others also looked at each other in surprise.

On the halfway up Mount Gu Niu, within the Casting Hall's residence, Xu Yunfan was led into an elegant small courtyard to stay.

"From now on, you will live here. In three months, my Casting Hall will hold the ceremony for accepting a direct disciple!" Zhan Yan couldn't help but smile. "At that time, I'll give them a surprise."

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't refuse, cupping his fists in thanks.

Zhan Yan waved his hand, pacing around the small courtyard. He walked to a rockery in the corner before slowly saying, "The Sky-Engineering Cave originally didn't have a Casting Hall. Back then, the Divine Weapon Ridge was smashed to pieces, the entire sect's lineage was severed, and strongmen occupied it. Those who dared to regroup at the sect's grounds all died.

"In the end, I found another way and came to the Sky-Engineering Cave, which led to the establishment of the Casting Hall. It can be said that we temporarily settled the lineage of the Divine Weapon Ridge here. Remember, now there is only the Casting Hall of the Sky-Engineering Cave, there is no more Divine Weapon Ridge."

Xu Yunfan: "I will strictly遵从 your command, Master."

By the side, Fu Jin said, "Junior Brother, now that we've settled down in the Sky-Engineering Cave, we are disciples of the Sky-Engineering Cave. Our Casting Hall is arguably the most sought-after division here. The earning ability of the others is far inferior. Forging a Sharp Edge level weapon and selling it, any one would fetch over ten thousand taels of silver. A few years ago, Master forged a Treasure Artifact, the Green Dragon Sword, which was bought by a swordsman from Yanbei Prefecture's Yanbei Dao City. At the auction, it sold for a full million taels of silver, a hundred taels of red gold and ten taels of green gold to get it."

Xu Yunfan was astounded. He hadn't expected forging weapons to be so profitable. He couldn't help but glance at the Skills column on his attribute panel.

Hmm, forging is a good path.

"Go on, go on, don't mention this. Go forge your own weapons. I need to talk to Yunfan."

Fu Jin left excitedly.

Watching him go, Xu Yunfan finally relaxed slightly. He was afraid that the Sky-Engineering Cave would be like the Sky Cicada Sect, where the master and disciples each had a hundred schemes, thinking every day about how to kill each other.

Zhan Yan said, "Although what Fu Jin said is true, forging is a good path."

His muscular, knotty arms flexed as he spoke.

"But our Casting Hall... it's only been established for twenty-five years. There are always people who can't stand to see a new furnace burning bright, so there are naturally some minor conflicts with the other divisions. But it's nothing serious. You just need to take care of yourself and don't have any reservations."

Although Zhan Yan spoke lightly, Xu Yunfan knew that with so many people in a sect, there are naturally many dirty dealings. The Casting Hall is an outsider, and now it's becoming the leader of the Sky-Engineering Cave, which naturally causes dissatisfaction among many. The direct disciple ceremony in three months恐怕 won't be peaceful.

Xu Yunfan nodded. "I understand, Master."

A thunderous laugh rumbled from Zhan Yan's throat. Seeing Xu Yunfan's expression, he naturally understood that the boy had grasped his meaning, and the admiration in his eyes grew stronger.

His rough palm suddenly landed on Xu Yunfan's shoulder, fingers like a vice, but he saw the other's neck tendons bulging yet he remained unmoved.

Subconsciously, Xu Yunfan's muscles and sinews instantly twisted like steel cables. This was the automatic activation of the Copper Body Art, which he had perfected. A golden luster shimmered beneath his bronze skin, and even threads of blood lines writhed ceaselessly, like cicada wings.

Xu Yunfan came back to his senses, his tense body immediately relaxing. He couldn't help but wryly smile. "Master, could you please not be so startling? Your disciple is already quite on edge."

He had almost activated the Golden Cudgel again.

Zhan Yan grinned, the wrinkles on his face spreading like a chrysanthemum.

"The Golden Skin state, how many years has it been since I've seen that? I couldn't help but want to take a good look. Even back at the Divine Weapon Ridge, and now at the Sky-Engineering Cave, it hasn't appeared in two or three hundred years."

Xu Yunfan: "..."

Zhan Yan then asked, "Besides练皮 (lian pi, skin tempering), do you have martial arts for筋骨 (jin gu, sinews and bones)?"

"Rest assured, Master. I practice the Flying Hair Legs for sinews and the Sky Cicada Strength for bones. Both have reached the perfect completion."

"Good, it's great to have such ambition. I will forge a Treasure Artifact for you within two months."

Zhan Yan naturally understood that Xu Yunfan wanted to perfect all three: sinews, bones, and skin. He wouldn't interfere. After a round of questions, confirming Xu Yunfan had no other needs, he told him to practice with peace of mind, promising that he would have daily meals of spiritual fish and exotic beasts, and every day would have the Sky-Engineering Cave's Yuan Candle Pills to replenish qi and strengthen his body.

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't refuse. Seeing Zhan Yan about to leave, Xu Yunfan paused slightly and called out to him, pulling out the fragments of the Purple Gold Shaking Earth Hammer from his chest.

"Master, I wonder if, when forging the weapon, this could be melted into it?"

"Divine Weapon fragment?!"

Zhan Yan's pupils contracted. He took the fragment and rubbed it repeatedly, his rough fingers sliding over it, his eyes filled with shock.

"I didn't expect a divine weapon of this level to be shattered... It's a pity, it's completely broken, its spirituality is gone, there's no possibility of restoration."

He was a bit surprised: "You kid have quite the fortune. If it were anywhere else, this Purple Gold might not be melt-able. Coincidentally, the Sky-Engineering Cave has a Thunderfire Pool that can melt this kind of material."

Xu Yunfan was overjoyed and feigned a foolish smile. "Found it on the road, just found it."

After asking a few more questions and confirming Xu Yunfan needed nothing else, he tossed the direct disciple token to Xu Yunfan and left in a hurry.

Zhan Yan didn't stop, going straight to the depths of the Sky-Engineering Cave, entering the Sky-Engineering Hall, and striking the Meeting Bell.

When the bronze bell's sound penetrated the twelve layers of lava caves, the Mechanism Hall Master was using his left hand, clad in a bronze glove, to dip a red-hot iron billet into a cold pool.

Through the quenching white mist, a disciple reported: "Master, the Casting Hall's bell!"

The short, stout old man with white hair and beard raised his eyebrows, having a few guesses in his mind. He immediately lost the mood to continue his mechanism research and casually tossed the iron billet in his hand aside.

"Interesting, that old stick, how many years has it been since he rang the bell? Today, he's breaking precedent."

Not long after, the masters of the nine peaks and six divisions rushed towards the Sky-Engineering Hall, stepping on the iron chain bridges. The copper rust on the chains was trampled into a rustling fall.
