# Chapter 133: The Mighty Heritage of the Golden Ship of Salvation!

The mountain breeze blew, carrying a hint of chill.

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official sighed and handed the token back.

The black-robed middle-aged man said nothing more, only bowing respectfully before asking, "Elder, will you return to the Golden Ship of Salvation?"

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official waved his hand. "We'll talk about it later."

The black-robed man nodded slightly, then hesitated before adding, "The current Heavenly Venerable has entered the Flaming Pass Mountain Grotto-Heaven. His fate is uncertain..."

He looked at the Ghost Valley Spirit Official. "Since the descent of the Heavenly Star, only Gao Xuan has ever returned from the grotto-heaven with an opportunity. Yet now, he has left behind his token and legacy, as if prepared never to return. Once a new Heavenly Venerable ascends, if you flee again, there will be no chance for you to return!"

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official was silent for a moment before suddenly asking, "What if I find the token and legacy?"

The black-robed man turned to leave, leaving only these words behind:  
"You are no longer part of the Golden Ship of Salvation. Even if you obtain the token and legacy, you cannot ascend to the position, nor will you command respect."

"..."

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official watched his retreating figure in silence.

After a while, Li Zhengjing and the others arrived.

"Is that man the current Guide Envoy of the Golden Ship of Salvation?" Yuan Zhengfeng asked.

"Yes," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official replied.

"Let me capture him and subject him to every torture device until he spills everything he knows!" The Hanging Bird flapped its wings excitedly, ready to give chase.

"He was once my disciple," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said, waving a claw. "Let him go."

"But..." The Hanging Bird was displeased. After painstakingly studying the Great Zhou legal codes and crafting various torture devices, it was frustrated that they remained unused.

"Enough. You'll get to use your toys eventually," Li Zhengjing said, pushing the bird aside before turning to the Ghost Valley Spirit Official. "What did you confirm?"

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official nodded slightly. "It's as we suspected. The third-generation Heavenly Venerable of Ten Thousand Tribulations Salvation was besieged by creditors and had no choice but to flee into the Flaming Pass Mountain Grotto-Heaven in search of a sliver of hope."

The third-generation Heavenly Venerable possessed the cultivation of a sect leader, held the "creditor" token, and had reaped the opportunities hidden within the Great Zhou's imperial jade seal. By all accounts, he should have been an overwhelmingly powerful figure.

But after the incident in the capital, he was severely injured and had yet to recover.

Faced with a true creditor, the third-generation Heavenly Venerable stood no chance of escape.

Thus, he resolved to enter the Flaming Pass Mountain Grotto-Heaven.

Though the grotto-heaven was a place from which human immortals and deities never returned—a place of unpredictable danger—there was at least the precedent of Lin Yuan Gao Xuan escaping alive, proving a sliver of hope remained.

"One thing took us by surprise," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said solemnly. "Before entering the grotto-heaven, the third-generation Heavenly Venerable left his token and legacy nearby. My disciple was here to search for them..."

Yuan Zhengfeng understood immediately. "No wonder he arrived so quickly—less than two hours after you used the Ascension Token."

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches. "Wait, if we find this so-called legacy, doesn't that mean..."

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official shook his head. "Only those under the Golden Ship of Salvation are eligible. Even I have been expelled, let alone the rest of you..."

Li Zhengjing pondered. "So even if we obtain this legacy, we can't become the next Heavenly Venerable?"

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official confirmed.

The Hanging Bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree were disappointed.

Only the Dragon Girl showed no interest, asking only, "Is it tasty?"

Upon learning it wasn't edible, she lost all curiosity.

But then, the young man named Hao Jian spoke up.  
"Didn't you take the boarding token? If you rejoined the Golden Ship of Salvation through that Guide Envoy, wouldn't you qualify?"

"..."

Silence fell once more.

All eyes turned to the Ghost Valley Spirit Official.

He coughed. "Seems like his soul is slowly recovering. A good beating does help. Go ahead and hit him some more..."

"Wait—no—ah—!"

Hao Jian was tied up again and beaten until he howled.

Li Zhengjing stepped forward and sighed. "Elder Ghost Valley, you just can't believe the third-generation Heavenly Venerable would fall, can you?"

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official's expression darkened. "It is hard to accept. But earlier... the reason I didn't rejoin the Golden Ship wasn't because I forgot."

He looked at Li Zhengjing. "In the Golden Ship, I am neither the oldest nor the strongest. My value lies only in my medical skills. In the struggle for power among the Ship's true elites, I doubt we could secure the Heavenly Venerable's legacy."

He paused before continuing, "Moreover, I don't believe becoming the Heavenly Venerable is the path to transcendence. On the contrary, the position only binds one tighter to the Ship... It's more like a shackle."

Yuan Zhengfeng said with mixed emotions, "So you simply don't want to become the fourth Heavenly Venerable?"

"Not just that," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official replied. "I've defected too many times. Even with the token, I wouldn't command respect, nor could I suppress the true old monsters. And if I failed to become the Heavenly Venerable, my next defection would mean a fight to the death."

Li Zhengjing pressed for more details about the Golden Ship of Salvation.

The first-generation Heavenly Venerable, 1,300 years ago, excavated the tomb of the Heavenly Azure Dao Venerable and concluded that there were no true immortals in the heavens—that ascension was a lie, and cultivation could not lead to transcendence.

Thus, he began constructing the Golden Ship of Salvation based on ancient legends, intending to transcend the world by traversing the void and crossing realms.

This philosophy gathered many powerful figures of the time, and the Ship grew in influence. After the first-generation Heavenly Venerable set sail, the second-generation further expanded it.

But its rapid expansion—transforming the Great Zhou Dynasty, major sects, Buddhist and Daoist schools, and even common folk into "drowned ghosts"—drew the ire of all factions. The second-generation Heavenly Venerable perished in the ensuing purge.

Now, under the third-generation Heavenly Venerable, the Ship has existed for over a millennium.

"The oldest members are the deities within the Golden Ship," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official explained.  
"They were once human immortals, powerful followers of the first-generation Heavenly Venerable who became deities to live a second life. They endure to this day.

"Deities recognized by the court are 'righteous gods.' Those like ours are called 'evil gods.'

"Beyond them, there are ancient human immortals who have cultivated for millennia, nearing the end of their lifespans yet still clinging to life.

"Most notable are the Twelve Demon Venerables cultivated by the second-generation Heavenly Venerable.

"They were the twelve demon-immortal helmsmen of his era.

"When the third-generation took the throne, he appointed twelve new helmsmen, stripping the Twelve Demon Venerables of their authority. But after centuries of cultivation, they are far stronger than the current helmsmen."

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official concluded, "The Golden Ship's forces are vast, its heritage profound, and there are ancient beings even I know nothing about..."

Yuan Zhengfeng sighed. "Rumors say the Golden Ship rivals any immortal sect or Buddhist school—that its hidden strength surpasses even theirs. It seems the rumors are true."

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official nodded. "The Golden Ship is indeed a top-tier power. But because its members are defectors from all factions, with many still embedded in other organizations, it's seen as a public enemy—the foremost demonic sect. Even the demonic sects of the Southern Wastes fear it, wishing for its collapse."

Li Zhengjing added, "No matter how powerful, the Golden Ship must remain hidden. If it surfaced, all factions would unite against it. No force can withstand the combined might of the world."

Yuan Zhengfeng lamented, "What a shame. If we controlled the Heavenly Venerable's token and the Golden Ship, we'd at least have some leverage against the creditors..."

After a pause, he fell silent again.

Such a mighty force would only grant them a sliver of resistance—not true parity.

For the true creditor was the one who stood alone against the world, the supreme powerhouse!

Li Zhengjing exhaled slowly.

In three months, he would face this creditor—the one who could defy the entire world.

"Actually, maybe we're thinking about this wrong," the Hanging Bird said after finishing its beating of Hao Jian.  
"Even if we don't become the Heavenly Venerable, that doesn't mean we can't take the legacy and token, right?"

Yuan Zhengfeng replied, "But the third-generation Heavenly Venerable's legacy would surely require the Golden Ship's methods to decipher..."

Before he could finish, everyone looked at the Ghost Valley Spirit Official.

Though expelled, he still knew the Ship's secret techniques.

"The Golden Ship's heritage rivals any major faction. The Heavenly Venerable's legacy must be extraordinary!" The Hanging Bird was excited.  
"And since the Ship's members come from all factions, their collected texts—cultivation methods, Dao arts, insights, secrets, even wine recipes—must be the most comprehensive! I bet they have every wine recipe in the world!"

"The bird's right!" The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches eagerly.  
"Let's take the legacy, grab the token, and sell it for a fortune!"

"..."

Silence.

After a long pause, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official muttered, "That... might actually work."

If they couldn't become the Heavenly Venerable, they could sell the token to someone who could.

As for the legacy, they'd keep what was useful and sell the rest along with the token.

"Brilliant!" Yuan Zhengfeng agreed.

The only sensible one present looked baffled.

"You're treating the leadership of a mighty faction... as a business deal?"

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin. "But it does seem like a zero-risk, high-reward venture..."

The group immediately fell into profit-sharing mode.

The Hanging Bird demanded all wine recipes in existence.

The Five Elements Creation Tree wanted divine waters and sacred soils, plus treasures to nurture the Wave-Severing Gu.

Yuan Zhengfeng proposed building a Dragon God Temple on the Golden Ship, with mandatory worship on the first and fifteenth of each month.

The Dragon Girl chimed in, asking for lots of food.

Hao Jian limped over to contribute but was beaten again before he could speak.

"You..." The Ghost Valley Spirit Official coughed. "We don't even have a lead yet, and you're already dividing the spoils? The Golden Ship's elites will swarm here—ancient monsters who've cultivated for centuries. Aren't you being too optimistic?"

The mood soured instantly.

Hao Jian shot him a grateful look.

But Li Zhengjing's attention was drawn to the northern sky, where a sword-light flashed past, heading straight for the Flaming Pass Mountain Grotto-Heaven.

"The Young Master of Kunlun Immortal Sect?" Li Zhengjing was stunned. "How did he grow so powerful in such a short time?"

Meanwhile, outside the Flaming Pass Mountain Grotto-Heaven...

The factions had reached a truce, jointly guarding the area.

The black-robed Guide Envoy who had met the Ghost Valley Spirit Official now removed his cloak, revealing armor beneath.

He donned a helmet, drew his blade, and hung a military token at his waist before entering the guarded perimeter.

No one stopped him as he entered the command tent.

Seated inside was one of the Great Zhou's military human immortals—Divine General Yuan Jin!

"The Ascension Token was indeed activated by the Ghost Valley Spirit Official," the Guide Envoy reported with a bow. "As he is my master, I withheld nothing..."

"No matter. He's left the Golden Ship. Even with the legacy, he can't become the next Heavenly Venerable," Yuan Jin said. "But when the Heavenly Venerable entered the Flaming Pass Mountain, why was there no disturbance?"

"I couldn't determine that," the Guide Envoy admitted. "Do you suspect he never entered?"

"Perhaps," Yuan Jin mused. "At first, I assumed the creditors forced him in. But if so, the guards would have noticed. He might have even fought through the army to reach the grotto-heaven. Yet reports say it was completely peaceful."

"So the Heavenly Venerable might have faked his entry?" the Guide Envoy ventured. "Or... slipped in with the last group?"

Since the Heavenly Star Grotto-Heaven appeared, the Great Zhou had sent six groups inside. Only Gao Xuan returned.

The later groups were weaker, led by mere Inner Energy cultivators armed with imperial treasures, talismans, and formations. None sent back word.

Now, it seemed the third-generation Heavenly Venerable was either still hiding outside... or had entered with one of those groups.

"But..." The Guide Envoy frowned. "What about the creditor chasing him?"

"..."

Yuan Jin's expression darkened. Just then, his command token glowed.

He activated it, revealing a message.

His face froze.

The Guide Envoy asked, "What is it?"

Yuan Jin handed him the token without a word.

The Guide Envoy's pupils constricted as he read.

"Someone from the first group to enter the Heavenly Star Grotto-Heaven," Yuan Jin said heavily, "has come out alive."

The second survivor after Gao Xuan.

The situation had just grown far more chaotic.
