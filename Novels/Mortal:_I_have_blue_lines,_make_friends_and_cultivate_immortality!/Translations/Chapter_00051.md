# Chapter 51: What Are You Trying to Do to My Brother!

Half a day later.

In the forest, Han Li also arrived at the location.

"Hmm? The Qi Induction Technique is reacting—could it be Brother Lin?" Han Li cautiously surveyed his surroundings. The Bloody Trial Grounds had become ten thousand times more dangerous for disciples of the Yellow Maple Valley, as the six sects had united to target them!

Just then, a streak of yellow light suddenly shot toward Han Li from behind. Fortunately, he had been on guard, and his Black Iron Flying Shield instantly surrounded him.

The incoming yellow light clashed with the shield, the two top-tier magical artifacts locked in a stalemate midair. Han Li finally got a clear look at the yellow light—it was an umbrella-shaped artifact, a rare sight.

"Who are you?" Han Li demanded, his eyes scanning the dense forest. "Why attack me?"

But before he could react, a crimson crystal sphere suddenly shot toward him, crashing into his Black Iron Flying Shield. In an instant, a dazzling pink light erupted, corroding the dark glow of his shield.

"Damn it! That crystal can erode artifacts!" Han Li's expression darkened. With a swift motion, he summoned the Golden Cicada Blade from his storage pouch, intending to shatter the strange crystal.

However, just as the blade was about to strike the pink crystal, a small green mirror, no larger than a palm, appeared in the sky. A beam of cyan light shot from the mirror, freezing the Golden Cicada Blade in place.

Han Li's eyes widened in shock. What kind of artifact was this? How could it immobilize another artifact so effortlessly? How was he supposed to fight back?

From the forest emerged a man and a woman.

The man stared greedily at the green mirror in the woman's hand and the pink crystal sphere in the sky. "As expected of the direct descendant of a Core Formation elder—such extraordinary treasures."

Han Li turned toward the voice and saw a middle-aged man with a scarred face, narrow eyes, and a hooked nose. His entire body exuded a chilling aura, making anyone who saw him shudder. His cultivation had already reached the peak of the thirteenth level, causing Han Li's heart to sink further.

The other was a young woman in white robes, her face somewhat attractive but marred by a pair of upturned eyebrows and a fierce expression.

"Humph! Don't look at me with those filthy eyes of yours!" the woman in white sneered. "If not for the sect's orders, I would never work with scum like you—Tian Que Fort's Madman Feng Yue!"

Her words dripped with contempt.

"Bitch, who do you think you are?" Feng Yue spat back. "If not for the sect's orders, I would've killed you long ago! Once we deal with Lin Yun, you're next! Consider those treasures of yours temporarily in your possession."

Though his Yellow Silk Umbrella was a decent top-tier artifact, it paled in comparison to the woman's mirror and crystal sphere. Not to mention, she had several other top-tier artifacts—so many that even Feng Yue was envious. It was the privilege of having a Core Formation ancestor.

Aside from the two of them, there was also a female disciple from the Yellow Maple Valley, trapped by a white silk-like artifact. It was her Qi Induction Technique that had alerted Han Li.

"Damn it! The scar-faced man is already tough enough, and now there's this treasure-laden woman too?" Han Li's heart sank to the depths.

The two turned their attention to Han Li, their expressions full of disdain. "We thought we'd caught a big fish, but it's just a measly eleventh-level cultivator."

Han Li snorted coldly. He needed to retrieve his artifact first if he wanted any chance of escaping. Fighting these two was out of the question.

With that in mind, Han Li pulled out a Thunderblast Pearl from his storage pouch, mixing it with a Chaos Pearl he had looted from another cultivator, and hurled them both at his enemies.

"Humph! You think such trash can stand against my top-tier artifacts? Dream on—" The woman's taunt was cut short as a thunderous explosion erupted. The pink crystal sphere was obliterated by the hidden Thunderblast Pearl, and both the woman and Feng Yue were sent flying.

The woman's mind was shaken, and the green mirror's glow dimmed. Seizing the opportunity, Han Li regained control of his Golden Cicada Blade. However, both the umbrella artifact and his own Black Iron Flying Shield were destroyed in the blast.

Losing his shield pained Han Li deeply. He hadn't expected to lose a top-tier defensive artifact on the very first day of the Bloody Trial. Fortunately, he still had the Earth Shield Lin Yun had given him. Though inferior to the Black Iron Flying Shield, it would have to do.

Seeing his enemies thrown off balance, Han Li immediately bolted.

"Bastard! I'll flay you alive!" Feng Yue roared as he staggered to his feet, his face twisted in fury.

The woman in white was equally livid. "A Thunderblast Pearl! Who would've thought he had something like that? He destroyed my artifact—I won't let him get away with this!"

The two gave chase.

Burdened with the captive Yellow Maple Valley disciple, the woman lagged behind. Feng Yue, however, quickly closed the gap thanks to his Cloud-Treading Boots.

Han Li ran desperately, but Feng Yue was faster. The distance between them shrank with every passing second.

"How the hell is he so fast?!" Han Li thought in dismay. His Misty Steps technique was being outpaced.

Realizing escape was impossible, Han Li gritted his teeth. "No choice—I have to use the talisman treasure."

Aside from the Golden Sword Talisman Lin Yun had given him, Han Li still had the last remnants of Lu Yunfeng's Radiant Sword Talisman (which Lin Yun had left intact after killing Lu).

Activating the last of the Radiant Sword Talisman's power, Han Li unleashed a massive gray sword beam toward Feng Yue.

"A talisman treasure?!" Feng Yue's expression darkened. "Well, well—I underestimated you!"

Seeing Han Li's move, Feng Yue pulled out a small dagger-shaped talisman of his own and activated it.

"Damn it—he has one too!" Han Li's face turned ashen. "Am I really going to die here?"

The yellow dagger clashed with Han Li's gray sword beam. But Feng Yue's superior cultivation and deeper reserves of spiritual power gave him the upper hand. Soon, the gray sword shattered—the Radiant Sword Talisman was destroyed.

"Nowhere to run!" Feng Yue bellowed, closing the distance in an instant.

The dagger talisman materialized in his hand like a blade, aimed straight for Han Li's forehead.

As the yellow light closed in, Han Li's pupils dilated. There was no time to activate the Golden Sword Talisman—it required a longer casting time, which was why he hadn't used it earlier.

"Brother Lin… I'm sorry. It looks like this is the end for me," Han Li thought. "If you find my body, take the little green bottle from my chest. With your talent and its power, you'll surely become a legend in the mortal realm."

In his final moments, Han Li didn't struggle. He had exhausted all his options. Instead, he focused on transferring the secret of the little green bottle onto the Soul Fusion Talisman Lin Yun had given him. With his last act, he flung the talisman away.

The talisman transformed into a streak of light, shooting into the distance.

Han Li had always kept the little green bottle separate from his storage pouch—wrapped in a fragment of a magic treasure and hidden in his chest—to prevent its loss. If Feng Yue only took his pouch, Lin Yun might still recover the bottle from his corpse. If his body was destroyed… well, there was nothing he could do.

Even if Feng Yue took the bottle, Han Li trusted Lin Yun's strength to reclaim it.

"Ah… my path of cultivation ends so soon," Han Li lamented silently. "But meeting Brother Lin made it all worthwhile."

Just as Han Li closed his eyes to await death, a familiar voice rang out:

"Hey—what do you think you're doing to my brother?!"

Han Li's eyes snapped open. Lin Yun stood before him, holding the Soul Fusion Talisman he had just thrown. Feng Yue, who had been about to strike, was now entangled in vines sprouting from the ground.

And Han Li himself was now clad in a faintly glowing golden armor—a rare defensive talisman treasure—that had blocked Feng Yue's killing blow.

"I was already crossing the Naihe Bridge… but Brother Lin pulled me back from the underworld!" Han Li gasped for air, his heart pounding as if it might burst from his chest. The sheer terror of death had nearly overwhelmed him.

But then his gaze fell on the Soul Fusion Talisman in Lin Yun's hand—the one containing the secret of the little green bottle.

In that instant, Han Li's pupils contracted violently. His heart seemed to stop, and a tidal wave of dread crashed over him, dragging him into an abyss of despair.

"Oh no—"

Han Li's face turned deathly pale, his entire body trembling uncontrollably.
