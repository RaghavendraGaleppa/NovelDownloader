**Chapter 31: Suppressing Dragons and Elephants**

The cowhide was undoubtedly ancient, having been stroked by countless hands until it was incredibly smooth. Yet, despite this, the overall texture of the hide remained completely undamaged.

"This doesn't seem like ordinary cowhide. A demonic beast's?" Chen Fei's mind flickered with old tales. It was rumored that this world, besides its eerie beings, also harbored demonic beasts. Like the eerie beings that preyed on humans, demonic beasts also cultivated themselves. Not only were they highly intelligent, but their power was also immense. However, there were no demonic beasts within Pingyin County; eerie beings, on the other hand, frequently made appearances.

An hour later, Chen Fei rubbed his eyes and lifted his head. He had finished reading the cultivation technique on the cowhide, but Chen Fei felt utterly confused. No matter how he looked at it, it seemed vastly different from typical cultivation methods. If Chen Fei were to try cultivating it normally, he wouldn't even know where to begin. He wondered how Jian Liang had managed to comprehend the Raging Waves technique from this cowhide. Or perhaps, Jian Liang's cultivation technique didn't come from this cowhide at all, but from some other source. Perhaps Jian Liang simply knew the technique recorded on the cowhide was precious, which was why he carried it with him and studied it from time to time. Chen Fei looked at the cowhide and tugged at it with a little force, but it didn't budge. His expression shifted slightly. He then pressed the edge of his sword against the cowhide and applied pressure.

The Pingyin County Yamen's stance was clear: intimidation. Barely two days after the incident, the Yamen dispatched men to encircle and suppress them. Although many had escaped, a significant number were killed. Jian Liang's head, in particular, sent a chill through the hearts of some bandits. This was the Third Boss! He had clearly broken through the encirclement last night, yet in the end, he couldn't escape death.

"Boss, how about we withdraw from Pingyin County for now? Last time, Third Brother was trapped, and this time, things turned out even worse. There must be a tracking master in Pingyin County; our simple disguises won't escape their eyes."

"Third Brother's revenge hasn't been taken yet, and you want me to leave now?" Ling Hanjun's gaze turned fierce.

"I'm just worried…"

"Slap!"

With a dull thud, Ling Hanjun backhanded the man, knocking him down and cutting him off mid-sentence.

"Investigate! No matter what method you use, find out that person's identity! I want him to pay for this blood debt!" Ling Hanjun roared. Seeing the others trembling, Ling Hanjun took a deep breath and ordered, "A few of you stay behind, the rest of you leave the city in batches!"

Nothing else, they simply offered too much.

"What exactly is the motive here? It couldn't be for that cowhide, could it?" Chen Fei suddenly had a realization. That cultivation technique was truly miraculous. After reading it last time, he had already forgotten most of it, and in a little more time, he would probably forget it entirely. Upon discovering this phenomenon, Chen Fei specifically recorded the "Suppressing Dragons and Elephants" technique onto paper. The result, however, made Chen Fei gasp in cold air. The characters on those papers would mysteriously disappear, several words at a time, by the next day.

"What kind of principle is this?" Chen Fei was completely baffled. No wonder the cultivation technique had to be recorded on this specific cowhide, and no wonder it had to be kept close to one's body. Before fully learning the technique, the text on the cowhide probably needed to be reread constantly.

"I have my panel, and the cultivation technique is already recorded. So, can this cowhide be sold now?" Chen Fei pondered silently, realizing he had gained another layer of understanding about this world. However, it seemed there were simply no buyers for this cowhide in Pingyin County. Or rather, even if there were a buyer, how would Chen Fei protect the silver he received after selling it?

"For now, I'll just use it as a makeshift protective amulet."
