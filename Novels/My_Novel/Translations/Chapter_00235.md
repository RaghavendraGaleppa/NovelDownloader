Chapter 235: Showing Promise, The Little Wolf Cub

The next day, dawn broke.

Mist shrouded the mountains dimly, and the first rays of the sun pierced through the gaps to fall upon the earth. Li Xian carried Wen Cai-shang on his back, threading vines through his waist and legs to tie her securely. Wen Cai-shang thought of the "wild boar" incident and spat in disdain. In all the world, only Li Xian would compare her to a wild boar.

Li Xian inspected his gear. He fastened his satchel to his chest, hung his saber on his left and his sword on his right. The Yellow Dao Bow was bound behind Wen Cai-shang. With everything arranged, Li Xian looked at his reflection in the stream and, finding a bitter humor in the situation, could not help but tease, "Does this count as me carrying my whole family on my back?"

Wen Cai-shang felt a wave of emotion. The servant was bullying the master, growing more arrogant by the day. Li Xian confirmed he was ready, his expression turning serious.

He thought to himself, "The journey ahead is fraught with danger, but I am not without the power to fight back." He had simulated the scenario countless times; if he hid and maneuvered, he could perhaps buy a few days of respite.

But that would be useless. Only by braving great danger can one achieve great life.

"You bully me for my weakness, but I shall make you taste the colors of my fury."

Li Xian patted his narrow saber and headed southeast. His steps were steady, leaping and bounding with incredible speed. He traveled over ten miles, gradually sensing traces of patrols, but never encountered anyone directly.

Wen Cai-shang asked, "Li Xian, are you planning to charge through head-on?" Seeing that Li Xian was not hiding his tracks, she secretly approved: "After all, it is hard to avoid them completely. Dying while hiding like a coward is not as good as fighting out畅快."

Li Xian replied, "Not a head-on charge, but a clever charge." Wen Cai-shang was confused; a charge is a charge, what is a clever charge? Suddenly, a patrol team appeared. Li Xian took out the Yellow Dao Bow and shot two arrows. At the same time, he pounced forward like a fierce tiger, his narrow saber slashing straight down.

The patrol team consisted of three men, all wearing the attire of the Sword Rain Pavilion. Before they could react, two were already shot dead. In the moment of shock of the remaining one, he heard the whistling of wind above his head, followed by a saber descending to split his chest open, killing him instantly.

Li Xian sprinted away with great momentum. Suddenly, he turned and ran in another direction. The layout of the forest was all recorded in his mind. After traveling several more miles, someone ahead shouted, "Found him, found him! He really is here!" It was a disciple of the Yellow Sand Sect who had discovered Li Xian.

Li Xian snorted coldly and said, "I think you have found your death!" He reached for an arrow to shoot, but seeing that his arrows were limited, he felt reluctant. Instead, he lunged to the ground, picked up three stones, and shot them out using the "Cloud-Riding Hand."

The attack was heavy and powerful. The three Yellow Sand Sect disciples raised their swords to block, only to hear a "clang" as the stones shattered into dust, flying into their eyes. The immense force dislocated their wrists, forcing them back several steps with screams of terror.

Wen Cai-shang praised, "What a heroic stance!" Li Xian plucked three leaves and flicked them lightly. From a distance of over a dozen zhang, they sliced through the three men's throats, causing blood to gush out.

This simple move concealed the essence of the "Cloud-Riding Hand" and the "Breeze Leg."

Li Xian combined the "Sending You the West Wind" of the Cloud-Riding Hand with the "Riding the Wind into the Gap" of the Breeze Leg. "Sending You the West Wind" focuses on the word "send." When throwing hard objects like darts or stones, one must be fierce, fast, and accurate. But when throwing soft objects like thin leaves or needles, seeking speed and ferocity would inevitably lead to a loss of accuracy.

But if it is not fast or fierce, how can it hurt people? Thus, there is the move "Sending You the West Wind." It is thrown gently, the force is light but long-lasting, like the feeling of "a light gift, but heavy on sentiment." At the same time, the palm pushes forward, sending out a "West Wind." The wind carries the light object; the speed is not fast, and the destructive power is not strong, but it is extremely difficult to dodge.

It injures people invisibly.

As for the Breeze Leg's "Riding the Wind into the Gap," it was originally a leg technique. It aims to strike densely, hitting the gaps in the opponent's defense, entering seamlessly like the wind. Applied here, it adds a sense of breeze, making the move even more powerful.

Li Xian charged straight ahead, displaying his martial arts to the fullest. This commotion quickly drew attention.

After killing several groups of men, the commotion spread further and further.

Suddenly, a "bang" was heard from above. Someone had set off a signal flare to gather companions for a siege. Li Xian had anticipated this, looked around, and plunged deep into the jungle.

He killed enemies he encountered along the way, clean and decisive. Li Xian had the bow for long range, stones for mid-range, and the saber and sword for close combat. Although his cultivation was shallow, the strength he displayed was not to be underestimated.

When he reached a narrow pass.

A flash of blade light suddenly appeared, and a man jumped down from above to strike a ferocious downward blow. He roared, "Little thief, you are too arrogant!"

This man had a wide face and large ears, his facial features squeezed together. He had a fierce look, and this move was truly impressive.

Li Xian dodged backward. He saw the great saber crash into the ground with a "rumble," kicking up a storm of yellow sand. Li Xian was both shocked and curious, knowing he had finally met a strong opponent. But in the damp, black soil of the forest, where did all this yellow sand come from?

The man let out a great "shout," and a strong wind surged from his chest. He blew the yellow sand, shooting it fiercely. Li Xian executed the Great Luo Saber Art, adding the intent of the Four Directions Fist. The blade shadows wove into a dense net, tightly guarding his front to resist the sand attack.

But the net always had gaps. Li Xian's arms and wrists were hit by sand grains, leaving red marks. He sensed that every grain of sand contained extremely strong internal Qi.

Li Xian thought, "This man's overhead slash hit the ground, instantly splashing yellow sand. Then with a shout, he made the sand fly. These two moves are very powerful! I must be careful, lest I fail in a ditch and suffer a great loss. Moreover... I have yet to properly experience the prowess of these great sect disciples!"

Even though he was in a bind, he remained calm and composed, focusing on the killing moves. The man slashed horizontally and chopped vertically, cutting down trees, weeds, and bushes... as if tearing through dry weeds and smashing rotten wood. Li Xian noticed that the branches and leaves of the trees he cut would immediately wither and dry up.

After a few exchanges, yellow sand filled the surroundings. The man waved his great saber, and after every slash, it was accompanied by endless yellow sand. Li Xian was not inferior either; he had yet to use many of his martial arts. He first used a piece of clothing to completely dissolve the opponent's attacks.

When the yellow sand rushed over, he would roll the clothing, blocking it all. Then, with a clap of Qi, the yellow sand was shot back, causing the man to suffer a great loss.

The man spun his saber, accumulating yellow sand. Li Xian took three steps back, planted his feet firmly, his palms glowing with green light, and gently pushed forward.

Mist emerged, and the palm strike was like a crashing wave. The two moves clashed, the mist swirling the wild sand, the palm force resisting the great saber. The momentum was immense.

The man twisted his waist and spine, seeing that he could not do anything, his competitive spirit grew stronger. He closed in with several steps, lifting his saber from below to above. This was "Flying Sand Fills the Sky." As he lifted the saber, the killing intent was extremely thick. If the strike missed, the yellow sand would once again obscure the opponent's vision.

He let out a great shout, his momentum fierce, his saber strikes endless. Li Xian dodged several blows. The sky was filled with yellow sand, but it could not obscure his eyes, and he remained composed. However, he could not help but think: "This man is truly powerful. I have killed many disciples of the Yellow Sand Sect, Sword Rain Pavilion, and Tai Xin Sect along the way. Although those disciples came from great sects, they had to form formations, and their martial arts attainments were average, their realm not yet at the Food Essence stage. But this enemy... is completely different."

Li Xian snorted coldly, his chest heaved, and he executed "Chest Drum Thunder Sound," the thunder sound traveling to his fingertips. A finger was shot out rapidly.

This move had immense killing power, an unparalleled shock force that could shatter stone and break armor easily. But strangely, it had no effect on the man. The finger struck his side waist, and the man merely trembled slightly, completely unharmed. Li Xian was very surprised and immediately changed his move, turning the finger into a fist to strike the chest. At the same time, fist shadows appeared, striking densely.

Li Xian clearly sensed that every time his fist hit the opponent, a quarter of the fist force was neutralized, as if hitting a water bag. But Li Xian's Qi strength was incredibly great. After several punches, the opponent spat blood and lost all fighting capability.

Li Xian muttered, "Since it is a matter of life and death, don't blame me for being merciless." He pressed the attack. To guard against the opponent's last resort, he picked up a vine and threw it far away, wrapping it around the opponent's neck and pulling hard.

The man flew toward him. Li Xian's toe kicked, sending the dropped great saber flying. With a "bang," it struck him, blood splattered instantly, the scene was terrifying, and the head was severed.

Li Xian resisted the urge to search the body and quickly fled.

Wen Cai-shang said, "That man should have some status in the Yellow Sand Sect. He has already entered a School."

"School?" Li Xian asked.

Wen Cai-shang explained, "As for martial arts schools, when several or a dozen martial arts complement each other and trigger a qualitative change, it is considered a School."

"The distinction of Schools is especially common in martial arts sects. Within the same sect, different focuses lead to different Schools. The person you just fought has taken the first step into a School. He has practiced three martial arts: 'Severing Water Saber,' 'Whole Body Art,' and 'Yellow Sand Heart Sutra.' They assist each other and make up for each other's deficiencies."

Li Xian pressed for details. Wen Cai-shang immediately elaborated, analyzing the various aspects of this School as an example.

This was the Yellow Sand School.

The Severing Water Saber was of a basic grade. In terms of saber technique alone, it was powerful and heavy, with continuous saber intent. It had no major flaws, but also no outstanding merits. However, its practice method was quite unique. During practice, one had to abstain from drinking water, maintaining a state of extreme thirst without dying.

But practicing the saber inevitably leads to sweating, and water loss cannot be replenished; how could one not die? The brilliance of this saber art lies in strengthening the 'spleen' and 'kidney' organs. Externally, one practices the saber; internally, one practices the organs. It mobilizes the spleen and kidneys to combine, transforming the water Qi throughout the body, creating an internal cycle that leaks no moisture.

In this way, when the Severing Water Saber is mastered, the spleen and kidneys are far superior to others.

The second martial art of the School: the Whole Body Art, requires these two organs as its foundation. The kidneys store water Qi, the spleen transports water Qi throughout the body, creating a water film under the skin. When struck by external force, it is like hitting water; the force is reduced by three-tenths if weak, and seven-tenths if strong.

The 'Yellow Sand Heart Sutra' is a lower-grade martial art, a secret of the Yellow Sand Sect. Wen Cai-shang did not know much, but she knew it could absorb the moisture of all things, endlessly replenishing oneself. If it hits a person, the wound will dry, crack, and be difficult to heal; it is extremely vicious.

In this way, the three martial arts complement each other. The Severing Water Saber strengthens the spleen and kidneys; the spleen and kidneys cultivate the Whole Body Art; the Whole Body Art transforms water; the Yellow Sand Heart Sutra absorbs water from things. They are interlinked.

Wen Cai-shang said, "The most powerful in this School is the Yellow Sand Sect's Yellow Sand Ancestor. By combining various martial arts, he can drain a person's life, drying them out, and then replenish himself. Besides that, the Yellow Sand Sect has another School called the 'Golden Saber School,' which focuses on ultimate saber techniques."

Li Xian memorized it all. He thought to himself, "My Iron Copper Body strengthens my lungs, the lungs strengthen the Chest Drum, the Chest Drum transforms into Gang Thunder... This could also be considered a School. Of course, it is a Gang Thunder Strengthening School that I stumbled upon by chance."

The Iron Copper Body and the Gang Thunder Finger practice process both strengthen the气血 (vital energy and blood) and increase strength. Their effects are superimposed and very compatible.

Just then, a burly man blocked the path ahead. Although Li Xian knew the Gang Thunder Finger and Iron Copper Body were perfectly compatible, he had never used them together.

He immediately took a breath and trembled, a dark luster bursting from his entire body. He executed the "Shaking Thunder Finger" of the Gang Thunder Finger. The two sets of martial arts reached their peak, evolving to their limit, and a strange scene manifested.

His fingertips seemed to be attached with black thunder light, emitting a "clanging" strange sound. It was neither like the Gang Thunder Finger nor the Iron Copper Body. This finger strike shot out, and the opponent raised his hand to block.

The moment it touched the fingertips, his whole body went numb, as if struck by lightning. He lost consciousness in an instant.

Wen Cai-shang's eyes were full of grievance. She did not know Li Xian had this ability; she had previously stabbed him with a sword to interrogate him, but he had not revealed it. She cursed in anger, "Alright, all your previous obedience was an act, you little wolf cub!"
