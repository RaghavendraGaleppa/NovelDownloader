# Chapter 308: Your Hands Are So Cold

The vast training grounds, filled with tens of thousands of soldiers, fell completely silent.

Even the Whale's Breath Coral Stone in the army formation trembled.

"My goodness, this item is connected to the earth's veins. It can withstand the impact of the Ninth Heaven of the Inner Scene Realm!"

"Didn't you see it just now? The coral stone turned red. That means Young Hero Li's strike just now, using the army formation, reached the intensity of the Outer Scene Realm!"

"A strike of the Outer Scene Realm from the God Observation Realm... this..."

"Excellent!"

The ten thousand soldiers erupted in cheers.

On the command platform, Zhong Zhenyue and Zhong Ling held their breath, watching the scene with wide, unblinking eyes, filled with envy and longing.

Amidst the wind and snow of the training grounds, the young man stood as the bravest among the army, like a god descending to the mortal world.

And the girl, who resembled a fairy in the snow, played the melody of slaughter with her fair hands. Her eyes held his image, yet they always carried a gentle, watery light that made the winter seem vibrant, as if the clouds had parted after a storm.

"Can we be like this in the future?"

Zhong Ling asked, biting her lip.

"We're far from it."

Zhong Zhenyue felt both envious and somewhat ashamed. "Setting other things aside, we grew up together since childhood, yet we don't have their level of tacit understanding."

Zhong Ling试探着道："Then... let's start cultivating that tacit understanding."

"..."

Zhong Zhenyue was stunned. Unbidden, the words Young Hero Li had said last night floated into his mind.

*If your biological sister wasn't your biological sister, would you want to kiss her?*

Speaking of which, why does Zhong Ling... look nothing like him?

Qu Sheng laughed heartily.

"Someone, bring my Snow-Treading White Dragon Steed. Guide Young Hero Li back to the command platform."

"Yes."

Commander Wu Lang personally went to fetch the horse and led Li Mo back from the formation.

The army formation slowly came to a halt. Amidst the heavily armored soldiers, the young man stood tall and proud, accepting the reverence of the troops.

*How satisfying.*

No wonder the protagonists in novels all enjoy showing off in front of a crowd.

It was a pity he wasn't wearing military attire; that would have made it even more perfect.

However, feeling the Stone Monkey Divine Mark within his Dantian becoming increasingly complete, Little Li felt that this small flaw wasn't worth worrying about.

The Seventy-Two Transformations were now complete.

The next divine ability would be the Somersault Cloud. Then, his biggest weakness—speed—would be made up for.

What comes after mastering the Somersault Cloud?

Wouldn't he be able to use the Gilded Creation Seal to evolve the Monkey King's Path Seeking Diagram into a Great Dao Divine Form?

Little Li excitedly clenched his fist.

"This is the General's mount. Please mount, Young Hero Li."

At this moment, Wu Lang brought over a young horse, entirely snow-white with no other colors, and silver scales covering its joints.

"Alright."

Little Li mounted the horse, his expression even more nervous than when he was the formation's core.

Riding a horse was just too difficult.

It was even harder than riding a person.

But everyone present chose to ignore his nervousness.

The young man was already bright and handsome. Having just proven himself the bravest in the army, and now riding this rare, precious steed—who wouldn't praise him as a dazzling hero on a fine horse, full of spirit and valor?

"Young Hero Li!"

Someone started the chant.

Soon, the entire training ground echoed with calls for him, like a tidal wave.

It was as if some peerless hero was returning triumphantly on a seven-colored auspicious cloud.

Hearing the approaching hoofbeats, Ying Ice gently raised her eyes, gazing at him as he approached.

She put away her guqin and rubbed the big-headed doll's head, a strange glimmer flashing in her eyes.

"Fairy of Ice commands the troops, more is better?"

"..."

Ying Ice's fingers, which were pinching the big-headed doll, paused. She said softly:

"Fierce wife fighting spirit, bravest in the army?"

A certain Little Li, whose horsemanship was originally poor, almost fell off his horse.

Back on the command platform, the generals naturally showered him with praise.

Qu Sheng even proposed that, to thank him for his contribution to the Greenwood Camp, he would gift this Snow-Treading White Dragon to a hero.

Little Li declined, using the excuse that he had a better mount.

Hmm.

It wasn't a horse.

It was the Somersault Cloud.

Although riding a cloud to charge in and out of a battlefield seven times sounded a bit strange, it was still more normal than a horse.

***

As time passed, the sky gradually darkened. After hiding for a day, the sun finally emerged from the clouds.

The afterglow洒满 the thin snow, reflecting a hazy light like a curtain. The exotic scenery of Greenwood City was reflected upon it, becoming even clearer and more vivid.

The carriage left the Greenwood Camp, where training was still in full swing and lights were brightly lit.

*'The system still has a pile of rewards I haven't checked.'*

*'I haven't had a chance to contemplate the Somersault Cloud yet.'*

Li Mo lay in the carriage, waves of exhaustion washing over him like a tide.

Even with his powerful physique, carrying forty units of soldiers and armor, he inevitably felt weak for a moment.

This exhaustion wasn't just physical; his spirit was the same.

He was truly tired.

And.

Not far away, the Ice Cube was lowering her eyes, her serene and flawless face resembling the snow outside the window reflecting the twilight. She was holding a pen, writing down her understanding of the army formation method.

The rustling of the pen, the crunching of the carriage wheels over the snow—harmonious and peaceful.

Li Mo's mind went blank. He didn't want to think about anything anymore, just quietly watching her.

"If only there were a Fog Flower Unaging Spring here too."

"Mm..."

Ying Ice glanced out the carriage window. Since the hot spring was at the Qingyuan Sect and not here, she said:

"Bathing in a light snowfall should be quite comfortable."

"A bath... the tub in our room seems pretty big too?"

Li Mo felt that with that tub, adding some heavenly treasures and such, it could barely be considered a low-grade version of the Fog Flower Unaging Spring.

He'd try it when they got back.

"..."

Ying Ice didn't seem to hear him, or maybe she did; she just kept writing.

It's just that tomorrow, Qu Sheng might have a few extra question marks on his forehead.

*What kind of formation is the 'Li Mo Formation'?*

*What kind of military tactic is the 'Bath Stance'?*

"Hey, Big Brother Li!"

As they got closer to the inn, they saw the sugar painting stall again. Today, there weren't many little kids around, only the stall owner's grandson, Tiger. Tiger spotted their 'King of Kids' right away.

"Big Brother Li, you guys aren't coming back from the Greenwood Camp, are you?"

"That's right."

"It was so lively there today. I heard a genius from the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List) was there for the military drill. Did you see him in person? Was he super impressive?"

"Pretty good. Only slightly better than Daniel Wu."

"???"

Li Mo glanced at the sugar painting stall and asked:

"Business isn't good today?"

"Yeah, it's too cold. The sugar freezes before I can finish painting, and I can't sell the sugar paintings. Grandpa was afraid the sugar at home would get damp, so he went back early, leaving me to watch the stall."

Tiger pouted, seeming unhappy about not being able to go to the Greenwood Camp to see the excitement.

"Then just sell sugar pills. Roll the sugar into balls, wrap them in paper, and sell them cheaper."

"Huh? How come Grandpa and I didn't think of that? Big Brother Li, you're a real genius."

Not long after.

Since they were close to the inn anyway, Li Mo got out of the carriage and enthusiastically started researching how to make sugar pills with Tiger.

Watching the young man roll sugar pills over there, a hint of helplessness appeared in Ying Ice's eyes. She then lowered her gaze to check the military formation strategy she had just written.

But after one glance, she froze.

To form the 'Li Mo Formation' and achieve the 'Bath Stance', the most crucial thing is the imported sugar...

Ying Ice's deep, clear eyes were momentarily filled with confusion.

*What did I write?*

*Why did I write down the system's punishment??*

Just as she was spacing out, Li Mo laughed loudly.

"Haha, our first sugar pill is ready!"

"Big Brother Li is amazing!" Tiger praised beside him.

Li Mo raised an eyebrow and smiled. He remembered that the Ice Cube seemed to like sweet snacks. She never said it out loud, but she had finished the entire sugar painting that day.

So he climbed back into the carriage and stuffed the sugar into her palm.

"..."

The freshly made sugar pill was warm.

If she put it in her mouth, it would probably melt quickly, turning into sweet, sticky sugar syrup, right?

Looking at the sugar pill, Ying Ice's eyelashes trembled slightly. She seemed to have found the reason why her military formation strategy was such a mess.

"Your hands are so cold."

Li Mo frowned and casually tucked her slender, fair hands, along with the sugar, into his pocket.

PS: The little failure author needs to take a sick day today. The medicine isn't bringing the fever down, so I'm going to get an IV drip.

Please give me some support.
