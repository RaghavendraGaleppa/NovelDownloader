# Chapter 153: Divining the Elixir Method, Anomaly Arises!

"Senior has taken a liking to this Dao statue?"

Seeing Gu Yuan's expression, the young man immediately understood and explained with a smile, "Senior may not know, but this Dao statue is unique to our Baiyan City. It must be forged from 'Dao Spirit Stone' and then placed within thunderstorms using a secret technique to endure countless lightning strikes. Only one in ten statues may develop spirituality and become a Dharma Divination Statue."

"After absorbing a cultivator's essence blood, this statue can simulate the cultivator's form and aura to divine a cultivation method, making it the perfect tool for testing techniques."

"While this statue is both precious and ordinary depending on the cultivator's needs, it sells quite well in the Ten Thousand Islands Sea region. To be honest with you, Senior, several other seniors have already shown interest in it recently."

Simulating a cultivator's aura and form to divine cultivation methods.

Gu Yuan hadn't expected such a peculiar object to exist in Baiyan City.

It was almost too perfect for his current situation.

With this statue, he could divine the "Six Ren Elixir Golden Scripture" and uncover its hidden mysteries.

Truly, different lands nurture different people. Given the frequent conflicts and myriad techniques in the Ten Thousand Islands Sea—many of which were likely treacherous—it made sense that such a unique "technique-testing tool" had been painstakingly developed.

"Take me to the Myriad Phenomena Auction," Gu Yuan immediately said to the young man before him.

"This junior will lead the way. However, there's one thing Senior should know: the statue can only perform divination once. Once used, it will shatter and cannot be reused. Additionally, if the technique is too profound or extraordinary, it may fail. There's no guarantee of success."

The young man respectfully complied but still offered a reminder.

"Let's take a look first."

Gu Yuan nodded slightly to indicate his understanding and had the young man lead the way.

Night fell, the bright moon hung in the sky, and all was silent.

"Senior, this is a first-class cave dwelling on the island. It costs a hundred spirit stones per night. Though expensive, it's absolutely worth it—ideal for cultivation or seclusion, with no disturbances whatsoever!"

The guide, Xiang Di, led Gu Yuan to a secluded cave dwelling, handed him a token, and respectfully departed.

Gu Yuan took the token, activated the formation, and meticulously inspected the cave with his divine sense and Zhaotian Spirit Eye. After setting up a simple concealment formation he had obtained from the Flying Fish Market, he sat cross-legged and placed a one-foot-tall stone statue on the ground.

---

Today's auction had gone smoothly.

Having plundered the wealth of three Earth Demons, Gu Yuan was confident in his financial resources. After some bidding, he secured the Dharma Divination Statue for two thousand spirit stones and a second-tier spirit fruit.

"To think I obtained this extraordinary item without even using the Stone Liquid. Now, I can uncover the truth behind the Six Ren Elixir Golden Scripture..."

"Still, to be safe, I should use the Stone Liquid first..."

Gu Yuan gazed at the statue, pondering for a moment before finally taking out the stone vial.

If the Stone Liquid revealed a new "cultivation opportunity" superior to the Six Ren Elixir Golden Scripture, he might save himself the use of the statue.

If the new opportunity proved inferior, he could then use the statue to divine the elixir method. In any case, it was best to conserve resources—unless absolutely necessary, the statue would be a last resort.

"Boom!"

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan dripped the Stone Liquid from the vial. Instantly, the world spun, stars flowed, and everything turned a hazy gray.

Countless white opportunity points shimmered like a galaxy throughout the market, dense and numerous.

There were also many green opportunities, some shifting positions, though most were faint and unremarkable.

Green opportunities no longer stirred Gu Yuan's interest—they couldn't compare to the Six Ren Elixir Golden Scripture.

Moreover, even if he obtained them, they likely wouldn't surpass the elixir method. There was no need to pursue them.

"Ah, well..."

Gu Yuan sighed softly and shook his head helplessly.

Profound techniques were hard to come by, especially those that could alter cultivation speed.

After several failed attempts, it seemed he had no choice but to accept his fate.

"I hope it's not some sinister or evil method—otherwise, all this effort would be for nothing..."

As the Stone Liquid's effects faded, Gu Yuan turned his gaze back to the statue on the ground, sighing inwardly.

---

"Drip!"

After meditating for some time to calm his mind, Gu Yuan flicked his finger, sending a drop of essence blood flying onto the statue.

"Rustle, rustle, rustle!"

As the blood touched the stone, the statue trembled slightly, shedding gray dust. In the blink of an eye, its stony exterior peeled away, revealing smooth, jade-like skin. Though only a foot tall, its features were an exact replica of Gu Yuan's, appearing almost adorable.

"Whoosh!"

Not daring to delay, Gu Yuan pointed his finger, channeling a continuous stream of mana into the tiny figure.

The small figure's body shimmered with spiritual light as if forming meridians, greedily absorbing the mana. Like a balloon inflating, it rapidly grew until it matched Gu Yuan's size.

Not only that—within its dantian, three Dao Foundations gleamed brilliantly, its mana surging like an exact copy of Gu Yuan's.

Yet its expression remained blank, devoid of emotion, its eyes filled only with a silvery-white glow.

"Demonic beings devour the sun and moon, refining the mysteries of the cosmos..."

"Dual cultivation, forming an elixir within the abdomen..."

As Gu Yuan recited the scripture, the statue's eyes suddenly gleamed with intelligence, and a profound aura surged forth.

Within its dantian, a strange, rounded object took shape—radiant with lightning, indistinguishable from the white insect's demonic core.

"Shua!"

The statue opened its mouth and exhaled, suspending the elixir above its head. Immediately, lunar essence descended, bathing the elixir in moonlight.

"Boom!"

As the moonlight touched it, the elixir blazed with light, refining at an astonishing speed. Mana poured into the statue's dantian in an unending stream.

At first glance, everything seemed normal—except for the sheer speed.

The elixir's cultivation speed far surpassed that of an ordinary cultivator, even exceeding the rate at which a demonic core could absorb lunar essence. It devoured the moonlight voraciously, producing mana at least twice as fast.

Such speed was beyond the reach of ordinary cultivators.

Gu Yuan watched as the statue's mana continued to grow.

But then, an anomaly quietly emerged.

The more lunar essence the elixir absorbed, the brighter it became—and the more the demonic energy hidden within it spread, growing increasingly rampant.

The statue's mana inevitably became tinged with demonic energy.

As time passed, this demonic energy grew denser. Just as the mana was about to break through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment realm, the statue's body began to mutate.

Smooth, jade-like skin sprouted armored plates, clinging to its body like a shell.

From its back,狰狞 bone spikes erupted, and its hair turned entirely silver-white. Sitting cross-legged and bare-skinned, it looked utterly demonic.
