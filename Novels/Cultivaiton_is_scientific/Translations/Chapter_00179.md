# Chapter 179: Trouble

The first battle to conclude was between Li Yuanba and the female cultivator. She was completely suppressed by the Swift Wind Golden Light Sword.  

Each strike from the sword's radiance sent shockwaves through her mind, leaving her unable to employ any other defensive measures. She could only passively hold her ground.  

After five strikes landed on her shield artifact, the spiritual imprint within it was completely obliterated.  

The female cultivator spat out a mouthful of blood, frozen in terror as the Swift Wind Golden Light Sword hovered before her forehead. A single move would mean instant death.  

With a wave of Li Shiming's hand, the Binding Spirit Rope flew out, tightly restraining the female cultivator.  

On the other side, the five Foundation Establishment cultivators attempted to attack Li Shiming, only to find the scenery around them shifting—Li Shiming's flying boat had vanished.  

The Nine Palaces Sword Formation in Li Shiming's hands was no simple technique. Illusion, thunder, and trapping arrays were all deployed in an instant.  

The massive calculations required for this were handled by IBMZ15.  

This formation utilized nine artifact-grade flying swords, which remained relatively stationary in the air but required constant adjustments to maintain the array's integrity.  

Though it was his first time using the Nine Palaces Sword Formation, Li Shiming had already conducted numerous analyses and prepared various tactics with IBMZ15's assistance.  

Clearly, the five Foundation Establishment cultivators had initially underestimated Li Shiming and Li Yuanba. With five of them—including one at mid-Foundation Establishment—they had been confident.  

But when Li Shiming deployed the Nine Palaces Sword Formation, they were caught off guard. They had never encountered an array master who could set up formations this way and had no idea what they were facing.  

Li Shiming was also reflecting on the battle. He felt the formation's setup time was still too long. Had the five cultivators chosen to flee immediately, they might have escaped before the formation was complete.  

"Young Master, let's attack the same spot! This hastily set-up formation can't withstand our combined assault!" the mid-Foundation Establishment elder said calmly.  

The young man nodded, his face showing no concern—only murderous intent.  

He could sense that the formation's illusion and trapping effects were formidable, but the thunder attacks were laughably weak. Multiple strikes against their defensive artifacts had no effect whatsoever.  

The thunder's power was barely at late Qi Refining level.  

Five artifacts struck a single point simultaneously, their combined spiritual energy carrying overwhelming destructive force.  

Li Shiming's fingers traced complex spell runes in the air—this was the core attack spell of the *Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique*, *Thunderstrike*.  

Golden thunder spiritual energy surged from his body into the spell runes, and a bolt of golden lightning formed at his fingertip.  

From casting to unleashing the golden lightning, it took three breaths—a delay caused by his lack of familiarity with the technique.  

His limited cultivation time and spiritual energy reserves prevented him from practicing this powerful spell more frequently.  

Fortunately, the Nine Palaces Sword Formation held firm. Despite the five cultivators' concentrated assault, they were far from breaking it.  

A high-tier array master wielding nine specialized artifact-grade swords was not so easily overcome.  

The golden lightning shot into the formation's thunderstorm, vanishing like a drop of water in the ocean.  

But this golden lightning was different—it was an attack from the pinnacle thunder technique, *Nine Heavens Thunderstrike*, and its golden thunder spiritual energy was at the peak of early Foundation Establishment.  

This strike surpassed the strongest attack an early Foundation Establishment cultivator could muster, and the enemy had no way to detect it.  

Under the elder's command, the early Foundation Establishment cultivators relentlessly hammered at a single point. The entire thunder-filled space trembled slightly, indicating their attacks were having an effect.  

Just as they began to rejoice, a golden bolt of lightning—amid countless others—struck one of the early Foundation Establishment cultivators' defensive artifacts.  

The cultivator, accustomed to the weak lightning strikes, assumed this would be no different. He didn't even focus his attention on defense, instead pouring all his energy into the assault.  

The moment the golden lightning touched his artifact, its true terror was revealed.  

With a thunderous *boom*, the defensive artifact was sent flying. The golden lightning seemed to bounce off it and directly into the cultivator's body.  

The man didn't even have time to scream before the devastating golden thunder spiritual energy ravaged his body, showcasing its destructive power for the first time.  

By the time the others noticed and tried to intervene, the cultivator was already lifeless.  

"Uncle Liu, protect me!" the young man shouted upon seeing his companion fall. He could delay no longer—it was time to use his trump card.  

The elder, addressed as Uncle Liu, recalled his attack artifact and summoned two defensive artifacts, shielding the young man completely.  

The other two early Foundation Establishment cultivators also deployed their defenses, forming an outer protective layer.  

The young man took out a treasure talisman and sat cross-legged on the flying boat, channeling his spiritual energy to activate it.  

Li Shiming hadn't anticipated this. He had hoped for a proper battle, but his opponent had resorted to a trump card immediately.  

He knew how terrifying treasure talismans were. Even as an early Foundation Establishment cultivator—let alone mid or late stage—he wouldn't dare face one head-on.  

A treasure talisman contained roughly one-tenth of a Golden Core cultivator's power—an absolute death sentence for anyone below that realm.  

Li Shiming summoned the four-meter-long *Top-Grade Magical Artifact Electromagnetic Cannon*, its six thick cables extending into the void.  

The *Thunderquake Array* in his machine room space had long accumulated its maximum electrical capacity, which was now funneled into the cannon in mere moments.  

A third-grade sword foundation transformed into a projectile and loaded into the cannon.  

Li Shiming waited as the cannon charged. The *Thunderquake Array*'s energy surged through the cables into the magnetic compression device.  

Two breaths later, the cannon was ready. Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator couldn't activate a treasure talisman in under four breaths.  

To a Golden Core cultivator, the difference between early Foundation Establishment and late Qi Refining was negligible.  

The sword foundation projectile, propelled by an indescribable force, shot through the accelerator barrel at unimaginable speed.  

The thunder within the Nine Palaces Sword Formation twisted violently. As the projectile launched, the shockwave carved a dazzling lightning-filled path through the storm.  

Uncle Liu suddenly felt a soul-deep tremor—a primal fear of death honed by countless near-death experiences.  

He hesitated: flee now and possibly survive, or stay and protect the young master?  

If he fled and the young master died, his lord would surely kill him anyway. But staying meant certain death.  

His deliberation was pointless—the electromagnetic cannon's projectile gave him no time to think.  

With a *crack*, one of his defensive artifacts shattered. The projectile pierced through his body and continued into the young man's chest, exiting through his heart.  

The half-activated treasure talisman slipped from the young man's grasp.  

His eyes dimmed as he desperately tried to lock onto Li Shiming's figure through the projectile's path. This final glimpse was the last thing he saw.  

"Young Master! Elder Liu!" The remaining two early Foundation Establishment cultivators were stunned. Their young master was dead, and the elder was gravely wounded.  

As they moved to assist, a towering, grotesque figure appeared before them.  

The three-headed, six-armed Nezha had no weapons, but the black claws on its arms were as deadly as artifacts, striking at both cultivators simultaneously.  

Meanwhile, Li Yuanba's sword light descended upon the wounded elder.  

Though the elder tried to resist, his injuries left him unable to muster much spiritual energy. With one artifact destroyed, the mental backlash further crippled him.  

Each of Li Yuanba's strikes sent fresh waves of agony through his battered mind.  

Li Shiming didn't rush. He retrieved the electromagnetic cannon, and the sword foundation projectile dissolved into pure energy, returning to his body.  

He cast *Thunderstrike* again—with his current reserves, he could use it five times at most, each with a different elemental attribute.  

This time, he unleashed a fiery red lightning bolt into the *Thunderquake Array*.  

Nezha didn't use the mid-grade Gatling artifact—its power was now too weak for Foundation Establishment battles.  

Until he solved the energy issue, Nezha couldn't wield more powerful firearms.  

A Foundation Establishment cultivator's defenses rendered late Qi Refining-level attacks meaningless. Nezha's claws were far more effective.  

The three-headed, six-armed combat puppet's performance delighted its creator.  

Fighting two opponents at once, Nezha's close-quarters dominance was absolute.  

As an Iron Corpse, Nezha could channel Yin-cold spiritual energy, reinforcing its *Radiant Armor* with an additional layer of Foundation Establishment defense—on top of its innate resilience.  

In battle, Nezha ignored defense entirely, focusing solely on offense.  

The early Foundation Establishment cultivators' attacks were effortlessly blocked by its claws—three heads and six arms left no blind spots, and its 360-degree vision ensured no attack went unnoticed.  

When one cultivator's defensive artifact suddenly exploded—courtesy of the fiery lightning—his guard dropped completely.  

Stunned by the residual lightning, he was helpless as Nezha's claws tore him in half.  

The remaining cultivator panicked and tried to flee, but with no sense of direction in the lightning-filled void, escape was impossible.  

Nezha's speed was formidable—one reason demonic cultivators prized corpse puppets. At the same level, they could withstand attacks, outpace ordinary cultivators, and deliver devastating blows.  

Of course, corpse puppets weren't invincible. At range, spells could whittle them down.  

But they were never meant to fight alone. Paired with their master, their strengths were fully realized.  

Nezha's three heads and six arms made it even more lethal in close combat.  

Li Shiming didn't waste more spiritual energy on *Thunderstrike*. Instead, he split the Nine Palaces Sword Formation's nine swords into two groups—three against the remaining early Foundation Establishment cultivator, six against the elder.  

This was the final blow.  

The cultivator blocked the three swords with his artifact, but each strike eroded its spiritual imprint.  

Before Li Shiming could launch a second attack, Nezha swatted aside the weakened artifact and ripped the man apart.  

Meanwhile, the elder's defensive artifact—already battered by Li Yuanba—finally collapsed under six simultaneous strikes.  

"My master, Yi Zhen, will avenge the young master! I'll see you in hell!" the elder screamed before Li Yuanba's sword pierced his heart, extinguishing his life force.  

Silently, Li Shiming collected all the bodies and their storage items. The young man's storage bracelet was a rare find.  

But he felt no joy—only resentment toward the captive female cultivator.  

He didn't know Baize Mountain or Yi Zhen, but anyone a mid-Foundation Establishment elder called "master" was undoubtedly far stronger.  

Given the young man's storage bracelet, Yi Zhen was almost certainly a Golden Core cultivator—and Li Shiming had just made a mortal enemy of one.
