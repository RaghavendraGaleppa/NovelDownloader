**Chapter 85: Shang Wu's Special Teaching**

"You should sleep in my room from now on."

Li Mo suddenly said.

Clang—

Along with his words, Ying Bing's bowl and chopsticks fell from her hands.

The utensils shattered into pieces on the icy floor.

Ying Bing was caught off guard, her breathing quickening slightly.

Li Mo was speechless, then said helplessly, "Look at this place, can anyone still live here?"

"..."

Ying Bing didn't speak, lowering her gaze to survey the room.

It was a complete mess.

Even the bed she slept on was currently supported by still-frozen ice. Once the ice melted, it would likely collapse.

"Move to the next room. I sleep quite comfortably in the side chamber." Li Mo added.

"Mm."

Ying Bing nodded, then retrieved a new set of chopsticks and slowly ate her meal, her movements still a little stiff.

Li Mo didn't know what had happened to her, nor what to say.

Perhaps, she just wanted some peace and quiet now?

*****

It was only mid-afternoon.

The "ice block" (Ying Bing) had moved to another room, continuing her self-imposed isolation. She didn't want to talk, nor did she practice cultivation.

Shang Wu, however, returned first, her beautiful face radiating confidence.

"Master, did you come back from reading in the Scripture Pavilion?" Li Mo asked.

"Mm."

Shang Wu nodded spiritedly, as if she had already grasped the ultimate truth.

"So, have you figured out what you're going to teach me?" Li Mo raised an eyebrow.

On second thought, it made sense. His Master, so young yet already an Elder with such profound cultivation, was indeed a phoenix among men.

She simply lacked methods for teaching disciples.

After a bit of learning, teaching him should be more than sufficient.

"I saw it recorded in a book: a Master should teach their disciple what they are best at," Shang Wu said, lifting her chin.

"That's right," Li Mo agreed, finding it reasonable.

"I thought about it, and what I'm best at are nothing more than three things."

Shang Wu held up three fingers.

Little Li, the student, adopted an attentive posture.

Then he heard his Honored Master proudly declare, "Fighting, drinking, and gambling."

Li Mo: "..."

It seemed there was nothing actually *wrong* with that.

But why did it feel so strange?

"That book also said that to teach disciples, one must lead by example. So, let's start with the first one."

Shang Wu looked at Li Mo, her almond eyes narrowing, a slight curve to her lips.

"Come on, let's have a fight first."

"While we're fighting, I'll teach you what you need to know."

Li Mo: "?"

What an excellent example of teaching by doing.

"Can we not fight?"

"No, I must be a qualified Master."

"Wait!"

"Now what?"

"Before we start, Master, could you please tell me where that book is located in the Scripture Pavilion..."

Little Li swore he was going to burn that book.

Shang Wu's squinted almond eyes flickered.

"I'll tell you after we fight."

"..."

Li Mo fell silent, a small flame igniting in his eyes.

Although his Master was known by many Elders as the "Innate Brawling Saint Physique," and her fierce reputation in Qingyuan Sect could stop crying children at night.

But now, he wasn't weak, was he?

He had, after all, once exchanged blows with the Daughter of Destiny!

Moreover, he had broken through his internal qi last night, making him stronger than ever.

Li Mo felt a little inflated, thinking he wouldn't lose too badly against his Master.

He followed his Master out the back door to the open ground behind it.

Thus.

As soon as he stepped out the back door.

*Buzz—*

A humming sound. Limitless fiery red energy spread around Shang Wu, completely enveloping a hundred-meter radius.

Instantly, everything fell silent.

A surging heat swept in from all directions.

In an instant, Li Mo felt as if he were inside an alchemy furnace, unable to perceive anything external.

Inner Domain.

This was the effect of an Inner Domain expert, influencing the world with their inner scenery, creating a field-like effect.

This, this isn't right.

"Master, aren't you going to suppress your cultivation?" Li Mo asked in confusion.

"First rule of fighting: if you can bully the weak, never bother with flashy tricks."

Shang Wu was truly serious about her teaching.

Li Mo: "!"

How am I supposed to fight you like that?!

I quit!

I want to quit!

But clearly, quitting was impossible.

The beautiful Master was itching for a fight.

*****

Half an hour later.

"Hiss..."

Li Mo staggered back, clutching his reddened forehead.

Alright, Master hadn't suppressed her cultivation, but she had still held back.

Every time he attacked, she responded with a flick to his forehead.

That jade-like finger felt like an insurmountable mountain.

No matter how he attacked, it would always flick his forehead the next second.

"Is that all you've got?"

Shang Wu rubbed her fingertips, chuckling softly.

"..."

Li Mo clenched his fists.

Wind-Shadow Steps!

His figure suddenly split into eight, rushing towards Shang Wu from different directions.

However, Shang Wu merely let out a soft hmph.

*Bang—*

The next moment, he flew back even faster.

"When fighting, never get emotional; always stay calm."

"You're not some hot-blooded youth from a storybook. Anger will only make you lose your composure against an enemy you could otherwise defeat."

"A true fighting champion can even find time to provoke their opponent."

Shang Wu's words fell.

Li Mo, dizzy from the constant flicking, didn't think too much.

In a moment of impulsive learning, he felt he had grasped the essence of his Master's words.

*Sigh*, isn't it just sweet-talking? I'm good at that!

Subconsciously, he smoothly said, "Old woman?"

Shang Wu's smile suddenly froze.

The air instantly solidified, only the blazing heat slowly intensifying.

"Heheheh... there was one more thing I didn't tell you."

Shang Wu's blooming face wore a 'benevolent' smile, words popping out through her gritted teeth one by one:

"Don't provoke an existence you can't defeat."

Li Mo: "!"

A fierce wind brushed his face.

It was as if an ancient, colossal beast was slowly awakening.

At this moment, Little Li's scalp tingled.

His innate survival instinct made him imbue himself with the power of the World Seed.

The Calamity Meteor Hammer appeared in his hand.

First Form of Firming the Cosmos: Settling Mountains.

*Buzz—*

The air solidified, everything around trembled wildly, blurring. A dense, tangible aura of sharp, killing intent wildly emanated.

Shang Wu, in a state of wrath, raised an eyebrow slightly.

*Boom!!*

The earth trembled, the great sun dimmed.

This was Li Mo's first time using a divine weapon.

Terrifying force filled the entire domain, even spilling out beyond it.

This hammer strike was like a thunderclap, like a heavenly punishment, fierce and unparalleled.

However.

The terrifying hammer clashed with the woman's pale hand, its momentum abruptly stopping.

Even the immense force instantly dissipated into nothingness.

"You rascal."

The Calamity Meteor Hammer in Shang Wu's palm hummed ceaselessly, her almond eyes filled with surprise.

Li Mo, of course, hadn't unleashed the divine weapon's full power, nor could he.

But merely managing to swing it once was enough to be utterly astounding.

Even she had needed to use a few points of strength to parry it.

"No more fighting, really no more fighting."

"Just flick me to death already."

Li Mo collapsed onto the ground, exhausted, turning into a 'salted fish'.

He wasn't going to be a master anymore.

"How did you do that?"

Shang Wu reached out and poked his face, looking at her precious disciple like a rare animal.

Li Mo retrieved his hammer and grinned, "Anger doesn't necessarily trigger an outburst of power."

"But the will to survive can."

What kind of answer was that?

Suddenly.

Li Mo's face suddenly showed alarm: "Elder Qian, why have you come? Are you here to collect a debt?"

Shang Wu was also startled, and sharply turned her head in the direction Li Mo was looking.

Empty.

Where was Elder Qian?

When she turned back, Li Mo was gone, having fled somewhere she couldn't even sense within her own domain.

This was something Little Li had just understood.

If you can't win, don't fight to the death.

Of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, running away is the best.

"How did he get out?"

Ying Bing narrowed her almond eyes, thoughtfully examining a corner of the domain.

She found the reason.

A hole, as if burned by some kind of flame, had appeared there at some unknown point.

"Shang Wu's domain is a projection of the Southern Blazing Fire."

"He can not only use a divine weapon, but also break an Inner Domain expert's domain?"

Up in the attic.

By the window.

Ying Bing silently witnessed everything.

Her eyes, which had only just calmed down, couldn't help but ripple once more.
