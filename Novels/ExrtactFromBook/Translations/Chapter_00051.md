# Chapter 51: The Fourth Divine Ability  

To outsiders, the giant ape's corpse and aura had completely vanished, leaving only a massive crater where it once stood—yet no one dared approach to investigate.  

As the third-order demonic beast's presence faded, the monsters besieging Fenrouji gradually regained their senses. Some with higher intelligence silently retreated, but most either fought over carcasses or continued attacking every cultivator within sight.  

The beast tide had left behind thousands of monster corpses—a considerable fortune. Yet compared to the devastation inflicted upon Fenrouji, it was insignificant.  

After the great demon's rampage, Fenrouji lay in ruins. The once-thriving marketplace, with its 396 bustling shops and endless streams of visitors, was no more. Only broken walls and scattered corpses remained.  

But the danger was not yet over.  

The remaining monsters had breached the defenseless Fenrouji, feasting on corpses and tearing through the wreckage. Surviving cultivators scrambled to escape.  

Courtyard No. 9, a place etched in Han Yue's memory, had been crushed to dust beneath the giant ape's feet. Every cultivator inside had perished. Of the entire district, only Fang Yi and Xiao Liu remained alive.  

Now, Xiao Liu carried the barely mobile Han Yue on his back while Fang Yi cleared their path, swiftly retreating eastward. Both wore grim expressions, their eyes bloodshot.  

The loss of loved ones and the destruction of their home had dealt a life-altering blow to every surviving cultivator. Yet their resilience held firm—not a word was spoken as they pressed forward in disciplined silence.  

When Han Yue finally regained consciousness, he found himself lying in a cave. Beside him, Xiao Liu tinkered with an alchemical furnace.  

"Brother Blade, you're finally awake!" Xiao Liu exclaimed. "How do you feel? Your injuries are severe, and we don’t have proper medicine. Sister Fang went out to find some!"  

Han Yue felt as if every bone in his body had been shattered, his organs lacerated by knives. His mana flow had nearly stagnated—this was the worst injury he had ever suffered.  

"How long was I out? Where are we?" he asked.  

"Three days and nights," Xiao Liu replied. "We're in Guizhou now, over a thousand kilometers from Fenrouji. There aren’t many monsters here—it's safe."  

Han Yue pressed further, "What happened to the ape demon? What’s the state of Fenrouji?"  

"After you struck it down, the ape vanished without a trace," Xiao Liu said, his voice heavy. "Fenrouji is gone—completely destroyed. The elders of the Green Lotus Sword Sect arrived later and slaughtered the remaining monsters. Now, it's just ruins."  

Han Yue nodded and fell silent, closing his eyes to assess his condition.  

His spiritual sense swept through his body, confirming the severity of his injuries. He had pushed himself beyond his limits, unleashing an [Unthinking Slash] that far exceeded his capacity. The backlash had left his organs and meridians riddled with cracks, his chaotic mana exacerbating the agony with every surge.  

This level of damage was beyond natural recovery—only high-grade medicinal treasures could mend it. But with Fenrouji in ruins and merchants scattered, finding such remedies would be difficult.  

Fortunately, Han Yue already had a plan.  

Summoning the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws*, he weakly raised his right hand and placed it on the fourth page.  

**Selected Keyword: [Healing].**  

*"Ding! Extraction conditions met! Proceed?"*  

"Extract!"  

At this critical moment, Han Yue had no other choice. He ignored the pointer resting at the first tier—even a green-tier ability would have to suffice.  

*"Congratulations! You have obtained the divine ability: [Avalokiteshvara’s Nectar]!"*  

A slender willow-branch rune materialized, flowing through his meridians before settling in his heart, soaking in his lifeblood.  

Without hesitation, Han Yue activated his newly acquired fourth divine ability.  

Instantly, a single drop of crystalline dew formed within his heart, radiating a surge of vital energy that nourished his wounded body. The sensation was like a desert traveler stumbling upon an oasis—his blood cooled and soothed, alleviating much of his pain.  

This [Nectar] was a supreme healing treasure. Just one drop had drastically improved his condition. And with the [Heavenly Origin Treasure Lotus] constantly replenishing his energy, Han Yue had no shortage of vitality.  

He began channeling the [Nectar] ability, producing an endless stream of the miraculous dew. His body felt as if it had returned to a mother's embrace, immersed in profound harmony and comfort as the [Nectar] circulated through him.  

His injuries healed at an astonishing rate, with visible progress every moment. Beyond mere recovery, the [Nectar] continuously strengthened his physique, even slightly extending his lifespan.  

Before long, Han Yue sat up abruptly, startling Xiao Liu.  

He reviewed his updated status in the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws*:

This was Han Yue’s first blue-tier divine ability—thankfully not the lowest green.  

And he was thoroughly satisfied.  

Compared to [Unthinking Slash] and [Earth-Spanning Golden Light], [Nectar] consumed far less mana. Beyond its exceptional healing properties, it fortified his body, enriched his foundation, and even granted a slight longevity boost.  

For Han Yue at this moment, it was the most invaluable ability he could have obtained.
