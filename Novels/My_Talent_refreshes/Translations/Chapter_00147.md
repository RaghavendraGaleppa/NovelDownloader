# Chapter 147: Defeating Three Ninth-Layer Qi Refinement Cultivators in a Row, Who Is This Person?

"A low-grade magic tool? No way!"

"An eighth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator against a ninth-layer! I thought he had some hidden trick up his sleeve, but he just pulled out a low-grade magic tool."

"He's probably just putting on a show. He'll probably surrender once the match is officially announced."

...

The waves of discussion from the crowd reached the ears of the two individuals on the arena stage.

Chu Ning's expression remained as usual, while the ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator named Ye Guoxin had a hint of disdain on his face.

Meanwhile, in the high platform of Feihong Island, the three members of the Jiang family were naturally watching the arena intently. When they saw Chu Ning take out an entry-level magic tool, the disappointment on their faces was palpable.

"Brother, you even said this Chu Ning might be hiding his true strength..." Jiang Gang muttered.

Jiang Hongguang merely sighed lightly, not responding.

At this moment, on the main platform, Cen Wenquan saw that both participants had arrived on the stage and immediately announced, "The match begins!"

"Fellow Daoist Chu, are you going to concede?" Ye Guoxin stood casually, not even taking out his own magic tool, simply looking at Chu Ning.

Chu Ning tilted his head, pondered for two breaths, then very seriously replied, "I wasn't thinking of that!"

As Chu Ning's words fell, his prismatic thorn flashed, and a fireball shot out, whistling towards Ye Guoxin.

Ye Guoxin's face slightly stiffened, caught off guard and somewhat bewildered by Chu Ning's response and sudden attack. However, seeing that what was coming at him was just an ordinary Fireball spell, he immediately let out a sigh of relief. There was no time to grab magic tools or talismans; his magical energy rippled, instantly forming a layer of green shield around him. This ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator, it turned out, cultivated a wood-attribute cultivation method.

"No way! He actually attacked!"

"But using a Fireball spell against a ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator, this is just..."

Many in the crowd burst into laughter as they watched the scene in the arena.

But on the stage, Ye Guoxin's expression suddenly changed. As the fireball rapidly approached him, he vaguely sensed something was amiss. This didn't seem like an ordinary Fireball spell. But by then, there was no time for him to think further.

"Bang!"

With a soft explosion, the fireball struck the green shield. The next moment, Ye Guoxin's green shield instantly shattered. Immediately after, the explosive flames struck Ye Guoxin's body.

The impact blast directly sent Ye Guoxin flying.

"Thud!"

The unprepared ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator flew up, directly slammed into the arena's restrictive barrier, and then fell back down. Fortunately, he finally reacted and activated another layer of defensive shield, which provided a buffer when he hit the ground. Even so, he was as disheveled as could be.

"Whoa!"

The scene erupted in an uproar. Many cultivators stared blankly at the stage.

"What... what's going on?"

"That Ye Guoxin was too careless! His defense was completely inadequate."

"But this Chu Ning's Fireball spell seems to have some power."

"It's still because Ye Guoxin was too careless, otherwise how could he have been sent flying so easily..."

Listening to the discussions, Ye Guoxin, who had just climbed up from the ground, looked incredibly grim. He slapped his storage bag, took out a magic tool, and was about to speak.

Just then, Cen Wenquan's voice rang out. "This match, Feihong Island's Chu Ning wins!"

In these Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands competitions, the rule was to stop before causing serious injury. If one side showed obvious signs of defeat, the match would end. This was because the challenge itself was already about seizing jurisdiction; if there were also serious injuries, it would lead to deep enmity, and the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands would never know peace.

Ye Guoxin knew this rule. He glared resentfully at Chu Ning, then flew off the stage and returned to his high platform. At this point, many people finally reacted.

The three members of the Jiang family looked at Chu Ning, who stood on the stage, somewhat stunned.

"We... we actually won a match?" Jiang Lan's face showed considerable surprise. Although she had questioned Chu Ning's words earlier, this straightforward young woman's joy was undisguised at winning a round.

Jiang Hongguang's expression, on the other hand, became more severe. "Fellow Daoist Chu took them by surprise just now. The next fight might not be so easy."

Jiang Hongguang's words were clearly not spoken idly. Because at that very moment, another cultivator flew out from Jingquan Island's high platform. It was another ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator, and he was even younger than the previous one.

"Xu Jianlong of Jingquan Island, I ask for guidance from my fellow Daoist of Feihong Island." This person looked at Chu Ning with ill intent but did not rush to attack.

Cen Wenquan, at this point, asked, "Does Feihong Island wish to switch out fighters?"

Chu Ning shook his head. "No switch!"

"The match begins!" Cen Wenquan announced, hearing Chu Ning's words.

Upon hearing this, both cultivators attacked simultaneously. Chu Ning still used his prismatic thorn to send out a fireball. The difference was that this time, Chu Ning's left hand also launched a fireball. As for Xu Jianlong, he seemed to have a defensive magic tool in his hand, and a faint yellow light shield enveloped his body. It appeared to be an earth-attribute defensive magic tool. It seemed he had learned from the previous match and intended to prioritize defense.

What slightly surprised Xu Jianlong was that this magic tool shield, which clearly had decent defensive power, shattered directly with a series of "bang" explosions. Looking at the fireball still flying towards him from behind, he naturally couldn't bother with attacking and quickly activated another defensive shield. But at the same time, Chu Ning's prismatic thorn had already launched another fireball.

Thus, the next scene in the arena made everyone's eyes widen. Chu Ning continuously launched fireballs, while the now passive Xu Jianlong frantically activated various defenses—magic tools, talismans... But each defense was easily shattered by a single fireball.

When the sixth fireball shattered his defense, Xu Jianlong was protected by layers of golden light shields. It seemed he was a metal-attribute cultivator. But clearly, he wasn't adept at defense; the golden light shattered upon impact. If he hadn't dodged quickly, the lingering fireball would have struck him. However, when Chu Ning's seventh Fireball spell arrived, his defenses finally couldn't keep up. Seeing the fireball about to strike him, Xu Jianlong quickly retreated, directly stepping off the arena stage. The fireball then struck the arena's restrictive barrier, emitting a slight explosive sound.

At this moment, Cen Wenquan immediately announced the result of the match. "The second match, Feihong Island wins!"

"Feihong Island won again!"

"This person actually won two consecutive matches against ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators!"

This time, everyone present looked at Chu Ning differently. Just now, they had personally witnessed Chu Ning using continuous fireballs to force a ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator to retreat from the stage and concede.

"I still think Xu Jianlong was too careless. If he had directly launched a fierce attack from the start, he wouldn't have been so passive."

"Indeed, there's still a difference of one cultivation layer between them."

"However, those fireballs Chu Ning launched were a bit strange. Ordinary cultivators' fireballs don't have that much power."

...

Below, discussions were rife. On the main high platform, many Foundation Establishment cultivators looked at Chu Ning with a different gaze.

"What exquisite fire control technique." The immortaless Cen, who was beside Cen Wenquan, uttered a delightful sigh of admiration. However, this sound could only be heard on the main platform itself, as it was protected by a restrictive barrier. Unless someone like Cen Wenquan actively used a special method, voices would not transmit outside.

"Niece Cen has excellent discernment!" After the immortaless Cen's words fell, another Foundation Establishment cultivator in his fifties on the side said with a smile, "Although Feihong Island's Chu Ning is only an eighth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator, he can merge three fireballs instantly upon casting, increasing the fireball's power by several folds. This fire control technique is indeed something never seen before."

These Foundation Establishment cultivators' observational abilities were far superior to those of Qi Refinement cultivators. After Chu Ning continuously used the merged fireballs, everyone noticed the difference.

Hearing the old man's words, the immortaless Cen smiled at him. Although her face was still covered by a veil, her eyes seemed to speak, brimming with a smile that made many young disciples on the main platform turn their heads. This indeed diverted some attention from Chu Ning.

While this was the case on the main platform, it was not so on the other high platforms. Especially on Feihong Island's high platform, the faces of Jiang Hongguang and the other two were now filled with pleasant surprise.

"Fellow Daoist Chu really didn't deceive us; he truly has means against those ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators." Jiang Hongguang's voice at this moment held undisguised excitement. After all, successfully defending their island meant their family could cultivate on a second-tier spirit vein. How could he not be nervous and excited?

Yu Yuanxiu, who was usually not very talkative, also spoke out, her face showing joy, "Husband, so it seems there is great hope for our Feihong Island to win this round of competition."

In contrast, Jiang Lan, who had been talkative before, stared blankly at Chu Ning in the arena, not saying a word. Clearly, she was quite shocked by the performance of Chu Ning, a helper whom she had initially considered to be of mediocre strength.

Hearing Yu Yuanxiu's words, Jiang Hongguang's joyful expression slightly receded. "We'll have to wait one more match to know. Among Jingquan Island's cultivators, the strongest isn't these two, but their island master, Zhao Yuanwei."

As Jiang Hongguang spoke, Xu Jianlong had already flown back to Jingquan Island's high platform. He looked somewhat ashamed as he addressed a robust middle-aged man. "Island Master, I have failed your trust. That fellow Chu's fireballs are truly peculiar."

The middle-aged man nodded calmly, then rose and flew directly from the high platform, landing on the arena stage.

"Zhao Yuanwei of Jingquan Island, I ask for guidance from my fellow Daoist of Feihong Island!" the robust middle-aged man announced.

Chu Ning directly responded, "Chu Ning of Feihong Island, I ask for guidance from Island Master Zhao." He had previously learned about these two islands and knew that the opponent was the strongest person on Jingquan Island.

Cen Wenquan on the main platform heard Chu Ning's words and withdrew his question about whether to switch fighters, instead directly announcing, "The match begins!"

As soon as these words fell, Zhao Yuanwei immediately launched his attack. A sharp axe appeared in his hand, and at the same time, he gained a layer of defensive shield while directly charging towards Chu Ning.

"He really is a body cultivator?" Seeing the robust Zhao Yuanwei's actions, Chu Ning's heart stirred slightly. He had heard Jiang Hongguang mention before that this Island Master of Jingquan Island was a rare body cultivator. Seeing him now, it was indeed true.

While thinking this, Chu Ning's movements were not slow. Raising his right hand, Chu Ning successively launched two fireballs. At the same time, a talisman held in his left hand quickly activated, adding another layer of protective shield around his body. However, Island Master Zhao was agile; his figure flashed repeatedly, dodging both fireballs. In the blink of an eye, he was already in front of Chu Ning.

The next moment, the sharp axe in his hand chopped down heavily towards Chu Ning.

"Ah!" Seeing this scene, Jiang Lan on Feihong Island's high platform couldn't help but gasp. Chu Ning's two consecutive victories had truly made this straightforward female cultivator consider him one of their own, so now, seeing Chu Ning in danger, she couldn't help but feel a bit more concerned.

"Pop!" In front of Chu Ning, a defensive shield formed by an entry-level, top-grade defensive talisman directly shattered.

However, the next moment, a dark, thick shield suddenly appeared in front of Chu Ning.

"Clang!" With a clang, Island Master Zhao's sharp axe was directly blocked.

"A high-grade defensive magic tool!" Island Master Zhao was slightly stunned, finally understanding a little. Most of the other onlookers also revealed similar expressions.

"No wonder this person dared to consecutively face several ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators. So he has a high-grade defensive magic tool."

"Look quickly..." Just then, the situation on the field suddenly changed.

Chu Ning, who had blocked Zhao Yuanwei's sharp axe with the dark shield, aimed his right hand's prismatic thorn directly at Zhao Yuanwei. Before the thorn even arrived, a fireball had already shot out.

If this were an unobserved fight to the death, Chu Ning could have used a Heavenly Gang Fist directly, which would have severely injured his opponent. However, Chu Ning did not wish to expose too many of his methods at this time, so he did not use it. But even so, Zhao Yuanwei, knowing the fireball's power was not weak, did not dare to directly meet it and quickly dodged away.

But this move, like Xu Jianlong before him, immediately put him on the defensive. As his opponent retreated, Chu Ning swung his prismatic thorn, and fireballs struck one after another.

If it were just fireballs, it would have been fine. But Chu Ning put away his dark shield, raised his left hand, and instantly, a flurry of talismans activated, turning into smaller fireballs that flew directly towards Zhao Yuanwei. Suddenly, the sky was filled with both large and small fireballs, completely engulfing the area in front of Zhao Yuanwei.

What astonished everyone even more was that not only was Chu Ning's right hand with the prismatic thorn extremely fast at casting, launching fireballs one after another, but the talismans activated by his left hand also seemed endless, with a dozen or so being thrown out each time he raised his hand. It made the onlookers below wince in pain.

Under this torrent of fireballs, Zhao Yuanwei had no choice but to repeatedly retreat, naturally unable to get close for the time being.

"How does this guy have so many talismans?"

"Although they're just low-grade Flame Talismans, this is too many. In just a few breaths, he might have thrown out over a hundred, that's two hundred spirit stones!"

"I remember now! This person seemed to have sold talismans in the market before. He's a Talisman Master!!"

...

While the crowd was merely astonished, Zhao Yuanwei on the stage was incredibly frustrated. Seeing the area ahead completely enveloped by various fireballs, unable to even see Chu Ning's figure, Zhao Yuanwei finally gritted his teeth. He casually activated a defensive talisman, then charged directly into the wall of fireballs.

The defensive shield, as expected, shattered upon passing through the wall of fireballs. Many fireballs even struck his body, faintly showing signs of injury on his third-level body-refining physique. However, Zhao Yuanwei's heart was overjoyed, for he had now gained the initiative. As long as he got close to Chu Ning, he believed victory would be his.

But at that moment, Zhao Yuanwei suddenly had a premonition of danger. He saw a thick column of fire suddenly appear before his eyes. Before he could react, the fire column directly struck his body.

Then, Zhao Yuanwei, completely unprepared and without any defense, was sent flying directly, slamming into the arena's restrictive barrier.

"This match, Feihong Island wins!"

As Cen Wenquan's voice fell, Zhao Yuanwei stood up, somewhat bewildered. He still didn't quite understand what had just happened. But soon, voices from below echoed.

"How did Feihong Island's Chu Ning know that Island Master Zhao would force his way through the fireball attack just now? He actually launched such a powerful fire column in advance! And it hit exactly when the opponent's defense was weakest and unavoidable."

"Could it have been a coincidence?"

"Can you be that coincidental? He clearly anticipated it in advance; how formidable..."

Hearing these discussions, Zhao Yuanwei's gaze deeply rested on Chu Ning, who stood calmly opposite him. Chu Ning also smiled at him, cupping his hands and saying, "I concede, Island Master Zhao."

"I did not concede, I was indeed outmatched!" Zhao Yuanwei shook his head helplessly. "Fellow Daoist Chu, with your eighth-layer Qi Refinement cultivation, not only are your spells so exquisitely cultivated, but your combat experience and skill are also outstanding. And you're even a Talisman Master. I never imagined Feihong Island could invite someone like you to join..."

After speaking, Zhao Yuanwei sighed lightly. Then, he looked up and loudly announced towards the main platform, "This challenge will not continue. Jingquan Island concedes."

"Whoa!!"

As Zhao Yuanwei's words came out, the scene immediately erupted in an uproar.

"Jingquan Island actually conceded!"

"What else could they do besides concede? The three strongest ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators of Jingquan Island all lost. Who else could they rely on?"

"What is the background of this Chu Ning? An eighth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator actually managed to defeat three ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators. This is too incredible."

At this moment, no one would attribute Chu Ning's victories to luck. After all, even Zhao Yuanwei praised him in such a way.

"This challenge, Feihong Island wins! For the next three years, Feihong Island's handed-over proceeds will be handled by Jingquan Island."

As Cen Wenquan's words fell, Chu Ning cupped his hands towards the main platform. At the same time, Chu Ning felt a divine sense envelope him from the main platform. Although Chu Ning did not release his own divine sense, with a slight perception, he realized that this divine sense belonged to the immortaless Cen sitting beside Cen Wenquan. He feigned ignorance and flew towards Feihong Island's high platform using wind manipulation.
