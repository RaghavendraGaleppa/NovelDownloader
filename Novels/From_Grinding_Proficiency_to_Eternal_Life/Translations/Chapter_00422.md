# Chapter 422: Pioneering the Dharma Lineage

The central head glared with wide eyes, its vertical pupil between the brows shooting out golden light that seemed capable of piercing through the nine netherworlds. The left head wore a gilded helmet, its face resembling an enraged Vajra, while the right head was covered by a black iron face mask, breathing out true flames of crimson fire.

Each of the six arms held a phantom of a divine weapon. The Void-Splitting Cloud Bow was drawn and ready to fire; the Mountain-Shaking Sea-Pressing Hammer was entwined with Earthly Fiends; the Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel blazed with sky-scorching flames; the Fine-Thread Sword split into countless blood lines; the Black Tortoise Chains dripped with dense vital energy. Finally, the last two arms formed the "True Warrior Subdues Demons Seal," suppressing all directions.

The Dao Foundation was covered in heavy dragon-scale armor, each scale branded with True Warrior cloud patterns. The beast-head motifs on the shoulders exhaled pure Yang energy, while the waist was bound by a python-patterned jade belt that connected to the Northern Dipper True Warrior.

The thirty-three sections of the spine, like a celestial pillar, shone as brightly as a chain of stars. When they resonated with the furnace in the Dantian, a martial arts phenomenon manifested behind him: "All Methods Return to the Source."

The Divine Warrior Dao Foundation—complete!

The moment this Divine Warrior Dao Foundation was born, even the incarnations of the three Golden Core True Lords present were drawn to look.

Lord Qingyuan, in particular, let the pure energy of his celestial palace fall in all directions, isolating the space around Xu Yunfan to prevent anyone from launching a sneak attack.

Regardless of how the outside world viewed the Primordial Origin Sect, calling it the Primordial Demon Sect, within the sect, the strong feasted on the flesh of the weak—the stronger grew stronger, the weaker were consumed. Those below the Foundation Establishment level were mere consumables.

However, once one reached Foundation Establishment, they became the backbone of the sect. They could open their own peak within the sect and continue their own Dharma lineage.

Especially since Xu Yunfan had entered the Dao through martial arts. After cultivating the Divine Warrior Dao Foundation, his combat power in the same realm was enough to look down upon all heroes, absolutely at the very top layer.

For both emotional and rational reasons, Lord Qingyuan would take action. Moreover...

Lord Qingyuan glanced at the nearby Hundred Peaks True Lord, who was, in fact, a subordinate of his subordinate—the leader of a force under his command. To have such a powerful underling, he was naturally very pleased.

Xu Yunfan retracted all his phenomena, his aura no longer spreading. The Dao Foundation condensed within his body lay dormant. He then swept his gaze around.

Wherever his vision passed, the disciples from the various sects who had been fighting him just moments ago all lowered their heads in unison.

To offend a Foundation Establishment True Lord, sometimes one didn't even need the other party to act personally. Just by slightly tugging at the threads of cause and effect and setting a trap, one would bring disaster upon oneself.

The struggle for the suspended mountain blessed land had come to an end.

On the side of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the incarnation of the Pure Yang True Lord was the first to retract. The nine golden suns extinguished one by one, and the scorching light receded like a tide, eventually turning into a gilded sword shadow that merged into the sword casket behind him.

The terrifying pressure that could boil the sea and burn the sky dissipated, leaving only the mountain rocks scorched by magma still emitting wisps of green smoke.

Simultaneously, the thousand-foot golden body of the Bodhisattva Miao Di began to fade. The sevenfold Buddhist light rippled like water waves and gradually faded. The Eight-Treasures Glazed Pagoda held in her palm slowly rotated, and the millions of strands of jeweled light emanating from the pagoda dissipated into the void like scattered starlight.

The thousand-petaled lotus platform beneath her feet withered petal by petal, eventually turning into a shower of golden light that drifted away in the wind. The guiding Buddhist light descending from the western horizon was also retracted, as if it had never appeared.

Although the two True Lords did not speak, the dissipation of their incarnations indicated their attitude, tacitly allowing the Primordial Origin Sect's control over this blessed land. After all, if they continued to forcibly stay, once a sect war broke out, even as Golden Core True Lords, they would find it difficult to bear. The great tribulation had not yet arrived, and it was necessary to lie low and wait.

As the last trace of Buddhist light vanished, the chaotic spiritual energy around the suspended mountain gradually calmed down, leaving only the pure energy of Lord Qingyuan's celestial palace still enveloping the area, signifying the change of sovereignty here.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan did not hesitate at all. He turned and bowed deeply to Lord Qingyuan.

"Many thanks for Your Lordship's protection. I have no way to repay this kindness. If there is any command in the future, I shall obey!"

Seeing Xu Yunfan's actions, Lord Qingyuan, who had retracted his incarnation, revealed a slight smile in his eyes. This youth was quite sensible.

He nodded slightly.

"Good. You may now open another peak within the Primordial Origin Sect."

Xu Yunfan's heart settled. He understood that the True Lord before him had already acknowledged him.

"Thank you, Your Lordship!"

Xu Yunfan bowed again with cupped fists.

By the time he straightened up, Lord Qingyuan had already disappeared from everyone's sight; no one knew when he had left.

The nearby Hundred Peaks True Lord, Chu Chengnan, stepped forward with a beaming smile. "Daoist Friend Xu, congratulations on forging your Dao Foundation. The sky is high, the sea is broad, and the sky is clear without clouds."

Xu Yunfan did not put on airs, merely offering his thanks repeatedly.

"If it weren't for True Lord's assistance, I would probably still be stuck in the Qi Condensation stage."

Seeing that Xu Yunfan was still so humble, the smile on Hundred Peaks True Lord's face grew even wider. "You originated from the Divine Warrior Realm and possess the Martial Dao Crystal and the True Warrior Subdues Demons Sutra. Even without me, you would have been able to forge the Divine Warrior Dao Foundation. I merely added the finishing touch."

Xu Yunfan naturally would not accept this, remaining polite.

After a round of mutual pleasantries, Hundred Peaks True Lord said, "Once you return, you may establish a peak within the Primordial Origin Sect. When your realm is stable, you may come find me. I have a matter that requires your help to resolve. You might even gain enlightenment from it and advance your cultivation further."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred. He naturally understood that having投靠 a faction and finding a backer, and successfully forging his Dao Foundation, meant he now needed to share the burden.

In a demonic sect powerhouse like the Primordial Origin Sect, betrayal and breaking promises were common tactics, and turning one's back on others without mercy was an iron law everyone abided by. Both parties knew this clearly, so Xu Yunfan naturally would not refuse.

Now that he had successfully established his Foundation, he finally had a foothold within the Primordial Origin Sect. He no longer had to worry about suddenly being captured and refined as a "resource."

"In that case, I will have to trouble Daoist Friend."

He cupped his fists slightly, his tone calm.

Seeing him switch to addressing him as "Daoist Friend" and accept so readily and decisively, Hundred Peaks True Lord felt slightly relieved. He thought to himself that this person was indeed sensible and not one of those arrogant, ignorant brats. Such a temperament was rare within the Primordial Origin Sect!

A trace of satisfaction flashed through Hundred Peaks True Lord's eyes. He nodded and said, "Rest assured, this matter will certainly not treat you unfairly. Since we are serving Lord Qingyuan, there are naturally benefits to be had. Once you return to the sect and stabilize your realm, come find me. I will take you to pick a suitable magic treasure."

Xu Yunfan's eyes immediately lit up.

Magic treasure!

Xu Yunfan's face immediately filled with eager smiles. He had indeed joined the right team.

"Certainly, certainly! I will have to trouble Daoist Friend then."

It was truly like receiving a pillow just when one felt sleepy.

Although he had now reached Foundation Establishment, he didn't have a single decent magic treasure on him, still using those dirty items that couldn't be shown in the light. Although, given his current status, even if he took them out to use, no one would dare to criticize, but as a proper Foundation Establishment True Lord, if he couldn't even produce a proper magic treasure, it would be too shabby.

Just as he was thinking this, Hundred Peaks True Lord took an ancient-looking token from his sleeve and handed it over.

"This is the Peak Establishment Token."

His tone was solemn. "Once you return to the sect, you may choose a location with abundant spiritual energy, pioneer a Dharma lineage, and establish your own peak."

The token was slightly heavy in his hand, its surface carved with intricate cloud patterns, faintly exuding a mysterious aura.

Xu Yunfan's fingertips brushed over those patterns, and a sense of heroism arose in his heart. From this day forth, he was truly a peak master.

(I'm completely burned out today; my mind is dry from all the plotting. I'll try harder tomorrow!)
