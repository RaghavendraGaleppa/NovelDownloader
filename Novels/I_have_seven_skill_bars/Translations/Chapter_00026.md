# Chapter 26: What Are You So Nervous About?

The spiritual field area naturally had outer sect disciples for management and daily inspections, to prevent any potential accidents. However, the number of outer sect disciples in the spiritual field area was very small; usually, one person was responsible for many allocated spiritual fields. Qingyu, assigned to the No. 56 spiritual field, had naturally never met Ding Rui before.

After listening, Qingyu nodded. It wasn't a big deal, and she also secretly congratulated herself for not immediately gossiping, which would have been counterproductive. She then said, "Since you've borrowed it, hurry back. Afternoon work is about to begin. I don't care why you borrowed the seeds, but don't delay the spiritual field's harvest."

"Thank you for the reminder, Senior Sister! I will definitely work harder!" Ding Rui replied modestly and respectfully, then nodded to Li Yizhen and the others before turning to leave.

Just then, the other female cultivators from spiritual field No. 56 also heard the commotion and awoke from their cultivation, all coming over to greet Qingyu. One of them, a female cultivator named Lanlan, watched Ding Rui's retreating back and couldn't help but run to Li Yizhen's side, teasing, "Oh dear, Zhenzhen's Senior Brother Ding Rui is here again! You two really can't bear to part, Zhenzhen's charm is truly immense."

Li Yizhen's face flushed. She quickly glanced at Ding Rui, saw that he had already walked far away and hadn't heard, then hurriedly looked at Qingyu. Only then did she turn back in embarrassment and annoyance, pouncing on Lanlan who had spoken: "Stop spouting nonsense, I'll beat you to death, beat you to death!"

Qingyu heard this and watched Li Yizhen and Lanlan chase and wrestle, immediately laughing along with the surrounding female cultivators.

Li Yizhen and the others didn't understand why, but they quickly followed. Qingyu walked up to Ding Rui and stopped, first offering a smile to prevent her earlier abruptness from causing any misunderstanding with Ding Rui. After all, she was the one with a request for him now, so she naturally had to be a little more considerate.

"May I ask, Senior Sister, is there something you need?" Ding Rui asked cautiously.

Li Yizhen and the others also ran over, looking at Qingyu.

Qingyu maintained her smile. After a moment's thought, she spoke, "Recently, I heard that Junior Brother Ding Rui, you've started a business of weeding and pest control in the spiritual fields."

Ding Rui nodded, honestly replying while wondering if there was any issue with his pest control and weeding activities. "Yes, that's true. It's because I recently cultivated the *Azurewood Art*. Since I'll be a spiritual farmer in the future, and the work pressure isn't small, I decided to get some practice in first. Besides, I saw other cultivators doing this in the spiritual fields, so I merely emulated them a little."

Qingyu gave a wry smile, mentally complaining, "You 'merely emulated them a little'? A 'little emulation' has almost monopolized all the weeding and pest control work in the entire spiritual field. If you really put your mind to it, wouldn't all the spiritual fields in the entire sect territory become yours...?"

Qingyu's words were very sincere, and Ding Rui naturally wouldn't deliberately prevaricate. Furthermore, this matter wasn't much of a secret, so he answered truthfully, "Senior Sister, rest assured, I'm doing this for personal cultivation reasons and to lay a foundation for becoming a spiritual farmer later on."

"But it won't last too long!" Ding Rui concentrated, roughly estimating, "It'll be about three or four months. If things go smoothly, it might even be shorter."

"Three or four months," Qingyu nodded. This duration was naturally not good news for Dongfeng. After all, waiting another four months would be the time for the next spiritual field harvest, and by then, Dongfeng would no longer need to earn extra spirit rice through weeding.

But she had, in the end, received an answer and confirmed that Ding Rui wasn't intentionally targeting anyone, so her mood was still good. With that, Qingyu put away her other thoughts and said to Ding Rui, "Then many thanks, Junior Brother, for informing me."
