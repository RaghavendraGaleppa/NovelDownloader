**Chapter 9: The Robber Cultivator Stir**

A tense atmosphere gradually permeated the market, with the term "robber cultivator" frequently on people's lips.

The Mo family's patrol guards intensified their patrols, but this seemed to be of no avail. They could only protect the area within ten li of the market. The further away from the market, the more dangerous it became.

Not long after, the corpse of a cultivator was discovered in a mortal town several dozen li away from the market. Most of the mortals in this town were descendants of cultivators, numbering tens of thousands. They had intricate ties with Qinghu Market, and many cultivators often went there for pleasure. In Qinghu Market, many low-level cultivators were nobodies, but once they arrived in that town, they immediately became "big shots." This stark contrast in status made many cultivators extremely infatuated with that town.

And now, that town had also become unsafe.

The corpse hung on a wooden stake in the very center of the town, dripping with blood. This was clearly a provocation, and also a deterrent. These robber cultivators seemed to deliberately create panic in Qinghu Market.

At the top of the wooden stake was a strange mark. After confirmation, people recognized it as the mark frequently used by the Green-Robed Three Brothers, who had been completely annihilated by the Mo family's Old Ancestor a few years ago.

The Green-Robed Three Brothers... they were back? These were notorious robber cultivators! Could it be that the Mo family's Old Ancestor hadn't killed all three of them back then?

People's gazes turned towards the Mo family's ancestral land at the core of the market. Soon, news came from the Mo family: the Green-Robed Three Brothers were indeed dead back then; this was definitely not them, but rather ill-intentioned individuals impersonating them. However, this rebuttal wasn't very convincing. As long as the Mo family couldn't capture this group of robber cultivators, people's hearts would remain unsettled.

But, did the current Mo family have the ability to capture these robber cultivators? Everyone couldn't help but recall that the Mo family's Foundation Establishment Patriarch seemed to have lived for a very long time! How much lifespan did he have left?

…

Half a year later.

"Fellow Daoist Lu, out setting up your stall again? How many talismans do you have on hand this time? I'll take them all!"

A hearty voice sounded beside Lu Xu's ear. Looking up, the person was none other than Lu Xu's major client, the young man called Little Tiger.

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Tan, long time no see! This time I have a total of seventeen talismans!" Lu Xu's face broke into a warm smile. After several transactions and becoming familiar, he also learned the man's name. This man was named Tan Hu, and he was friends with Gao Tianqiang, the fishmonger stall owner.

"Seventeen, huh? Good, the spirit stones I brought this time are enough to cover it!"

Tan Hu discreetly took out a cloth bag and handed it to Lu Xu, and Lu Xu likewise handed him a bag.

Tan Hu opened it and glanced inside, a smile immediately spreading across his face. He lowered his voice and said: "Fellow Daoist Lu's talismans are truly impeccable in quality. I'll come looking for you next time. No matter how many talismans you have, as long as you can produce them, I, Tan, can take them all!"

Lu Xu also lowered his voice: "Then many thanks, Fellow Daoist Tan, for always taking care of my business. I didn't expect your demand to be so high. It seems I'll have to find a few more colleagues to supply you with talismans in the future!" His words hinted that he wasn't making all these talismans himself, but rather there was a talisman-making organization behind him, and he was merely the seller pushed to the front.

Tan Hu smiled ambiguously upon hearing this, said nothing more, and turned to leave.

After the man departed, Lu Xu opened the cloth bag and took a look. Inside were not seventeen spirit stones, but one hundred seventy. That's right, the transaction between him and Tan Hu was for one hundred seventy talismans.

Lu Xu fell into contemplation: "Generally, such large-batch talisman procurement is done at the Divine Talisman Hall. It's difficult for ordinary talisman masters to provide so many talismans!"

"This person doesn't procure from the Divine Talisman Hall, but instead buys large quantities from us scattered talisman masters. He's clearly afraid of something?"

"What kind of organization does he belong to?"

"And he was the one who proactively proposed this secret transaction method. Clearly, he doesn't want outsiders to know he's procuring so many talismans!"

"Of course, I don't want others to know either!"

Tan Hu's identity was clearly highly problematic. Lu Xu had a faint guess in his heart, but he didn't intend to stir up trouble. He was just a small talisman master; the talismans that needed to be sold would still be sold. He would continue to sell talismans to this person in the future.

Because now, his success rate in making talismans was getting higher and higher, and he was producing more and more talismans. Over the past half year, he had produced over six hundred and forty first-tier, low-grade talismans. More than eighty percent of these talismans were sold to Tan Hu in batches. This person was also extremely terrifying; no matter how many talismans Lu Xu produced, he could take them all. This made Lu Xu extremely wary of him.

But he had no choice; he could only cooperate with this person, otherwise, he wouldn't be able to sell so many talismans. In fact, ever since his success rate for making first-tier, low-grade talismans soared to forty percent, Lu Xu had been facing a situation of overcapacity.

The talisman market in Qinghu Market wasn't particularly large; the total annual demand for first-tier, low-grade talismans was only around ten thousand. The Divine Talisman Hall and the Mo family would take the lion's share of this quota. The market left for rogue talisman masters was probably only about three to four thousand talismans.

And Lu Xu's current talisman-making efficiency was extremely exaggerated. Because of his strong spiritual energy, he made talismans more times a day than other talisman masters. Plus, his success rate was high. Therefore, the number of talismans he produced was far greater than that of ordinary rogue talisman masters. If he were to sell all of them, it would immediately disrupt the market. The Mo family and the Divine Talisman Hall would notice. Lu Xu certainly didn't want these two factions to discover that he was a talisman-making genius.

So, in the past six months, he had only sold dozens of talismans to rogue cultivators; such a quantity was not enough to attract the attention of observant individuals.

"Tan Hu is highly problematic, but I also have my own issues. We are a partnership where both benefit if we cooperate, and both suffer if we split. I can't lose this major client for now!" Lu Xu thought to himself.

"I wonder if Tan Hu believed the story I concocted about having a talisman-making organization behind me. For now, my biggest threat is this partner!"

Recalling his various interactions with Tan Hu in the past, Lu Xu grew worried. Previously, when Tan Hu proposed the secret transaction, he had even tried to invite Lu Xu out to conduct the transaction in that mortal town outside the market. Lu Xu, of course, refused without hesitation.

"Bargaining with a tiger. I'll have to be even more careful in the future!"

After contemplating for a while, Lu Xu rose, packed up his stall, and walked to the stall opposite: "Fairy Yin, are you free today? I'd like to invite you to Mingqing Pavilion for a cup of tea!"

Yin Yu was indeed out with her stall today. Lu Xu wanted to see if he could learn anything about Tan Hu from her.

"Oh? Is there something you want to ask me about?" Yin Yu asked, somewhat puzzled. Mingqing Pavilion was a very private place; most people who went there were either to inquire about information or discuss matters that couldn't be known to outsiders.

"There are indeed some things I'd like to consult you about, Fairy," Lu Xu said in a low voice after glancing at the fishmonger Gao's stall.

"Then wait a moment. Let me see if I can sell all this monster meat today!" Yin Yu pointed to her stall. Lu Xu's gaze followed, and he saw a wooden board on Yin Yu's stall. On the board were pieces of fresh, delicate monster meat, emitting an enticing aroma mixed with a bloody scent.
