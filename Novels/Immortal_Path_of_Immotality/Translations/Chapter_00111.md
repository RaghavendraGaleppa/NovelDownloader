# Chapter 111: Comprehensive Enhancement

"I'd like to advance my annual salary offering."

Lin Shan steeled himself to make this somewhat embarrassing request, but he had no choice—poverty had made him desperate.

The Wind Escape Talisman was the only one available in the talisman shop, and who knew if it would still be there in a few days? Moreover, he needed to purchase other items to prepare and adapt in advance. Waiting until the last minute might be too late.

Surprisingly, Elder Zuo proved unexpectedly generous, perhaps because he saw potential in Lin Shan's future and was willing to offer him some convenience. 

Alternatively, a mere thousand spirit stones might be insignificant in the eyes of this auction house tycoon. He approved the request without hesitation.

With Elder Zuo's approval slip in hand, Lin Shan descended the stairs and found a group of appraisers and auction house cultivators gathered together, discussing his recent breakthrough to Foundation Establishment. The dozen or so individuals were startled to see him appear so quickly.

Then, one after another, they offered flattering smiles, addressing him as "senior" repeatedly.

In the cultivation world, strength was paramount—age mattered less than cultivation level. Whoever had the higher realm was the "senior," a deeply ingrained principle where mastery commanded respect.

Watching his former peers change their attitudes and address him as senior, especially seeing elderly men bowing to a "youth" like himself, Lin Shan felt slightly uncomfortable for the first time.

*This won't shorten my lifespan, will it?*

He muttered inwardly but quickly adapted to his new status on the surface. After exchanging pleasantries, he handed Elder Zuo's approval slip to a female cultivator in charge of finances.

"Advance my annual salary!"

The woman couldn't help but exclaim before quickly covering her mouth. Under the curious gazes of those around her, she hurried to the back to process Lin Shan's request.

...

With 1,200 spirit stones now in his possession, Lin Shan felt a renewed sense of confidence and swaggered back to the shop district.

"Wind Escape Talisman and Blazing Fire Talisman—I'll take them!"

The shop assistant, seeing the spirit stones in the storage pouch, handed over the talismans with reverence.

Lin Shan then swept through the entire shop district, purchasing a wide array of items for his upcoming journey: detoxification pills, miasma-dispelling pills, water-repelling pearls, spirit-replenishing pills, rejuvenation talismans, healing ointments, night pearls, calming incense, and more.

Since his journey to the Eastern Sea to join the demonic sect was fraught with uncertainty, it was better to be overprepared than underprepared.

Finally, he visited the Formation Pavilion, originally intending to buy a defensive formation to secure his future residence. However, he discovered that even the cheapest Spirit Gathering Formation cost 500 spirit stones, while formations capable of defending against Foundation Establishment cultivators started at several thousand.

Left with no choice, he settled for two sets of restriction jade slips—one for a Maze Restriction and another for an Alarm Restriction.

Compared to formations, restrictions were less stable and powerful—essentially simplified versions—but they were far more affordable. They would at least give him time to react to potential threats.

With that, Lin Shan's pockets were once again empty, leaving him unable to do anything else.

He had originally considered buying a few puppets or a spirit pet to raise, but reality couldn't support his dreams.

...

Back in his residence, Lin Shan laid out his purchases, preparing to upgrade everything that needed strengthening to ensure he wouldn't lag behind other Foundation Establishment cultivators in combat prowess.

Having just broken through to the early Foundation Establishment stage, he had entered a new realm. However, while he had been dominant among Qi Refinement cultivators, he was now at the bottom of the Foundation Establishment hierarchy.

Though his cultivation level might be the lowest among his peers, as long as he could compensate with other means, there was no reason he couldn't play the underdog.

First, he took out his mid-grade magic tool, the Gale Banner, and spent 16 points of Ancient Charm to enhance it.

The banner suddenly stood upright, enveloped in a swirling mist. Inside, it vibrated with an indistinct hum as if undergoing some transformation before finally landing in his hand as:

**[Cloud-Subduing Pennant]**

**Quality:** High-grade magic tool  
**Description:** A wind-attribute magic tool inscribed with five advanced runes: Sharpness, Spell Resistance, Spirit Gathering, Concealment, and Illusory Clouds.  
**Enhancement Cost:** 32 points  

"Hmm?"

Lin Shan examined the description. This time, the enhancement seemed to lean toward concealment and illusion.

But this wasn't surprising—enhancements were inherently random. The Gale Banner had originally balanced offense, defense, and support. The Cloud-Subduing Pennant adding two unrelated effects was understandable.

The pennant's tip could function as a spearhead, making it a decent offensive tool.

The pennant's body could resist spells, though it was best not to clash with weapons directly, as it might be severed by a superior offensive tool.

The Spirit Gathering effect was purely supportive, with no need for elaboration.

The Concealment effect was excellent for masking his aura.

Combined with Illusory Clouds, he could transform into a cloud in the sky—perfect for stealth.

"A multi-functional magic tool!"

Compared to the Cloud-Copper Heart Mirror's extreme physical defense and the Five Elements Fan's multi-attribute attacks, the Cloud-Subduing Pennant filled many gaps in his arsenal.

After refining it with his spiritual sense, Lin Shan felt a sense of exhilaration. Activating the pennant, he wrapped himself in it, transforming into a drifting white cloud within his cave abode.

Passing through a large tree in the courtyard, he could even phase through it seamlessly.

Indistinguishable from a real cloud, the illusion was flawless.

"Excellent!"

Pleased, Lin Shan stored the Cloud-Subduing Pennant but decided against upgrading it further to a magic treasure.

During his time on Turtle Fishing Island in the Eastern Sea, Lin Fan had mentioned that magic treasures could only be activated by Golden Core cultivators' mana.

Mana was the new energy produced after Golden Core cultivators condensed their cores and transformed their spiritual power. Foundation Establishment cultivators still relied on spiritual power, which was incomparable in quality.

Without the ability to activate it, a magic treasure could only rely on its inherent passive properties—such as the Water-Repelling Pearl's "water-repelling" effect or the sharpness of certain swords and shields.

Thus, even if he enhanced it into a magic treasure, it would be useless to him, costing him a valuable tool for no gain.

Instead, he pulled out the Wind Escape Talisman and Blazing Fire Talisman. Enhancing talismans was a safer bet since they could be activated directly without prerequisites.

After some thought, he set the Wind Escape Talisman aside.

As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he could likely escape most threats with it, so enhancing it wasn't urgent.

Moreover, talismans were consumables—only a Wind Escape *technique* would be worth investing in.

The Blazing Fire Talisman, however, was different. As a high-grade talisman, it was equivalent to a full-power strike from a Foundation Establishment cultivator's high-grade spell. While it had been a decent trump card during his Qi Refinement days, it was now barely useful.

But he hadn't bought it for its current form—he intended to enhance it into a Minor Divine Ability Talisman!

The reason he didn't buy a wind-attribute high-grade talisman for enhancement wasn't because he had a particular fondness for the "Blazing Sky Incineration Talisman" but because the Blazing Fire Talisman was the cheapest.

At 200 spirit stones, it was far more affordable than wind-attribute talismans, which could cost up to 500—a price he couldn't afford as a broke cultivator.

Having already overdrawn his auction house salary for the year, he wouldn't earn another coin before leaving Yichuan. A high-grade talisman would have to suffice for now.

Having witnessed the power of Lin Fan's talisman, he had a rough idea of what to expect.

"Blazing Fire Talisman—enhance!"

The high-grade talisman in his hand erupted with blinding light, its original chaotic inscriptions cracking as beams of radiance shot out in all directions, startling Lin Shan.

A faint humanoid figure seemed to appear on the talisman, setting up an altar and wielding a brush with divine precision. Strands of energy from the world were drawn in, converging into a fiery red square talisman.

**[Blazing Prairie Talisman]**

**Quality:** Minor Divine Ability Talisman  
**Description:** Sealed within is the fire-attribute divine ability "Blazing Prairie," equivalent to a full-power strike from a late Golden Core cultivator's minor divine ability spell. Deals area-of-effect damage. Single-use only.  
**Enhancement Cost:** 64 points  

This enhancement from a high-grade talisman cost 32 points of Ancient Charm, but the result—an ultimate trump card—was well worth it.

Products from the Enhancement Panel were always top-tier, with quality and performance maxed out.

A late Golden Core cultivator's minor divine ability spell, even if it wasn't a single-target attack, would likely annihilate any Foundation Establishment cultivator caught in its epicenter. Even an early Golden Core cultivator would likely suffer severe injuries.

"Blazing Prairie Talisman—similar to the Blazing Sky Incineration Talisman? Are they part of the same series?"

Lin Shan didn't dwell on the name differences. The Enhancement Panel's description was clear—the power was what mattered. Enhancements didn't always align with expectations, but this was close enough.

His Minor Divine Ability Talisman was undoubtedly far stronger than Lin Fan's.

Different Golden Core cultivators crafted talismans of varying potency, and he had absolute confidence in the Enhancement Panel's superiority!

Next, Lin Shan took out the Qi Refinement cultivation manual *Wind Thunder Art* he had purchased. The quality of his cultivation technique determined the quality of his spiritual power, so he needed to choose the most suitable one for enhancement.

This enhancement, however, proved unexpected. The *Wind Thunder Art* already had an existing successor technique in the cultivation world, pioneered by predecessors. Thus, the enhanced version retained its original name.

**[Wind Thunder Art]**

**Quality:** Foundation Establishment Cultivation Technique  
**Description:** Created a millennium ago by "Ouyang Feng," an outcast of the Violet Heaven Sect. A dual-element cultivation technique combining wind and thunder. Upon mastery, spiritual power transforms into wind-thunder hybrid energy, doubling its potency.  
**Enhancement Cost:** 32 points  

"Ouyang Feng, an outcast of the Violet Heaven Sect?"

"To create a dual-element cultivation technique like *Wind Thunder Art*, he must have been a formidable figure!"

"A thousand years ago? That's not too distant."

"I should ask Lin Fan about this."

After some thought, Lin Shan took out a message talisman, finally replying to Lin Fan's previous barrage of messages while also expressing his curiosity about "Ouyang Feng."

With a wave, the talisman flew toward the message box at Yichuan's External Affairs Hall, where specialized couriers known as "Messenger Fairies" would deliver it.

Since he was completely broke, he set it as "collect on delivery."

*It's not that I'm stingy—it's just the life of a rogue cultivator. Lin Fan can cover it for now, and I'll pay him back later.*

After this small detour, Lin Shan began switching his cultivation technique. With only 40 points of Ancient Charm left, he decided to keep them as a contingency.

If he encountered an unavoidable danger, he might need to enhance a magic treasure or Minor Divine Ability Talisman to survive—requiring at least 32 points.

If no danger arose, he would need those points to enhance pills when he reached the peak of early Foundation Establishment and sought a breakthrough. Without additional Ancient Charm by then, these remaining points would be his lifeline.

The Black Lotus Sect was a major demonic faction with countless experts. Even as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, there was no guarantee he could access the Black Lotus Buddha Statue to absorb Ancient Charm. Keeping a reserve was essential—like foreign exchange reserves to hedge against risks.

For the remaining year, his sole task was to swiftly transition to the *Wind Thunder Art*, replacing his previous *Gale Art*.
