# Chapter 129: First Battle Against a Sect Leader-Level Powerhouse! The First-Generation Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World Heavenly Venerable!

As Li Zhengjing approached, he heard the burly old man's voice and saw his magical power transform into a long whip, lashing toward him.

The whip arrived in an instant, clearly aiming not just for the small cauldron but also for his life.

"Old bastard ambushing me—no martial virtue at all!"

At this moment, Li Zhengjing had no time to dodge, but he didn't need to. He simply raised the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron to block the attack. This object could even withstand the Great Yan Void-Transforming Sword Qi—it was no ordinary treasure!

Just as Li Zhengjing expected, the whip struck the cauldron, and the most intense impact was deflected. The tail of the whip flicked toward the top of his head, but golden light erupted from his eyes as sword qi burst from his acupoints, intercepting and shattering the whip.

"Oh?" The burly old man, holding a magical whip that bound the true dragon in the sea, turned his gaze toward Li Zhengjing.

The young man's aura was exposed—only at the True Qi realm. Yet this whip strike should have been enough to kill a Human Immortal. Unexpectedly, the boy had blocked it.

"The Great Yan Void-Transforming Sword Qi of the Kunlun Immortal Sect—someone actually mastered it?" The old man looked surprised, then turned to Ghost Valley Lingguan behind him. "Junior, take this whip and keep that true dragon bound. It's a legendary divine beast, said to rival a True Immortal when fully grown—we can't let it escape."

He severed the magical whip and handed it to Ghost Valley Lingguan, then strode toward Li Zhengjing. His eyes held a playful glint, like an old cat eyeing a young mouse.

"Impressive. In all my years away from the Central Continent, I never expected such a talented junior to emerge. Under normal circumstances, I'd spare you and recruit you into the Crossing World Golden Ship. But today, with the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron and a true dragon involved, I have no choice but to silence you."

With a flick of his finger, a violet-gold hammer shot from his sleeve, glowing brilliantly as it smashed toward Li Zhengjing.

The hammer's strike enveloped the space within a hundred zhang around Li Zhengjing, distorting the void and trapping him as if in quicksand. But the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron flared with light, freeing his movements. Li Zhengjing raised the cauldron with his left arm, blocking the hammer.

The impact sent him crashing into the sea.

"What a pity—such a prodigy, doomed by misfortune." The old man sighed, extending another magical whip toward the sea.

But at that moment, the silver true dragon, previously bound by the whip, suddenly broke free and lunged at the old man, claws bared.

"Heavenly Venerable, I can't hold it!" Ghost Valley Lingguan shouted.

"Useless!" The old man snorted, pressing down on the young dragon with his sect-leader-level power, suppressing it completely.

Meanwhile, 365 streaks of sword qi erupted from the sea, targeting the old man. Though Li Zhengjing was only at the peak of the True Qi realm, the half-blade of the Immortal Sword within him amplified the sword qi's lethality, making it a threat even to Human Immortals.

Faced with this assault while distracted by the dragon, the old man's expression turned serious. With a thought, a nearly impenetrable barrier of magical power formed before him. The combined force of the 365 sword qi strikes failed to breach it.

"Not bad, boy. I've attacked you twice, and you've survived both times, even counterattacking." The old man's tone was full of admiration, but he raised his hand, conjuring a massive palm of magical power that covered a hundred zhang of sea, intending to crush Li Zhengjing in one strike.

But suddenly, the world seemed to slow to a standstill.

A dragon's claw protruded from the old man's abdomen.

The first-generation Heavenly Venerable of the Crossing World Golden Ship looked down in shock, then swung his arm back—only to strike an object that erupted with light, blasting him away.

It was the Luofu Summoning Heaven Banner, one of the Luofu Immortal Sect's sacred treasures!

Ghost Valley Lingguan held a length of intestine in one claw and the banner in the other.

"Traitor!" the Heavenly Venerable roared. "How dare you, a subordinate of the Crossing World Golden Ship, attack me?"

"I've defected more than once. Betraying my superiors isn't exactly new." Ghost Valley Lingguan waved the intestine. "You're not the current Heavenly Venerable—you don't have the token to activate the Golden Ship's mark in me. Why should I fear you?"

He smirked. "Young friend Zhengjing and I are close. Compared to an old relic like you, of course I'd side with him. Besides..." His eyes gleamed with excitement as he carefully stored the intestine. "You've lived nearly two thousand years without using the Heavenly Domain Divine Stone for a second life. I'm curious how you've kept your flesh and soul intact."

He licked his lips. "I'll dissect you and find out!"

"Insolence!" The first-generation Heavenly Venerable's fury burned. After a thousand years at sea, the first junior of the Crossing World Golden Ship he encountered had betrayed him, dealing a severe wound.

If not for the dragon and the boy diverting his attention, if not for the Luofu Summoning Heaven Banner masking the attack—how could he have been ambushed?

As he seethed, a chill ran down his spine.

A hand emerged from the sea, palm glowing with sword qi transformed into flame. A pillar of fire shot toward his back.

"What?!" The Heavenly Venerable dodged, but another wave of sword qi struck, piercing his hastily conjured barrier and grazing him.

Before he could react, the silver dragon pounced, claws slashing.

"Dragon's body?!" The old man clenched his fist and punched, repelling the young dragon—but it exhaled a torrent of dragonfire, scorching the sky and boiling the sea.

The Heavenly Venerable barely had time to react before the Luofu Summoning Heaven Banner summoned a storm, drenching him in corrosive rain and wind that hurled him back three hundred zhang.

Li Zhengjing swallowed a dozen spirit stones, merging his 365 sword qi into one reinforced strike, followed by a blast of the Left Palm's Fiery Divine Sword.

At this point, Li Zhengjing still didn't know the old man's identity—only that he wanted him dead. So he fought with everything he had.

"Sect leader or not, I'll kill you if I get the chance!"

Ghost Valley Lingguan charged with the banner, while the silver dragon tried to join—only to be intercepted by the eight tentacles of the octopus demon, which had survived its earlier injuries.

Flames, sword qi, and storms collided, nearly annihilating everything in their path.

Then a massive palm swept through, dispersing the storm. Ghost Valley Lingguan barely raised the banner in time to protect himself but was still sent flying.

Li Zhengjing, sensing danger, raised the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron again.

The violet-gold hammer struck, hurling him back hundreds of zhang, his organs churning. Before he could steady himself, the burly old man appeared before him, his abdominal wound visibly healing.

"You three could dominate the world together—only sect leaders could stop you. But against me, you're still lacking."

The old man seized Li Zhengjing's throat. "Who are you?"

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page's fortune-telling and relaxed slightly. "Who are you?"

"I founded the Crossing World Golden Ship. Who do you think I am?" The old man studied him. "Such talent, mastering the Great Yan Void-Transforming Sword Qi—are you the Kunlun Immortal Sect's young master?"

Without waiting for an answer, he channeled his magic into Li Zhengjing's body, intent on crushing him to paste.

But the moment his power entered Li Zhengjing, his skin withered at visible speed. His vitality and magic were being drained.

The two-thousand-year-old Heavenly Venerable paled in horror. "The Azure Dao Treasure?!"

Li Zhengjing, equally stunned, realized the truth—the old man's longevity came from the Azure Dao Lord. Their shared origin allowed Li Zhengjing's treasure to siphon his life force.

In moments, the Heavenly Venerable aged drastically.

"Restrain him!" Ghost Valley Lingguan attacked again with the banner, while the dragon broke free and joined the assault.

From the shore, twenty golden dragons surged forward—Hanging-Wall Bird had arrived with the Dragon Pillar of the Hall.

"Fine! Fine! Fine!" The Heavenly Venerable laughed coldly, then fled northwest in a streak of light.

His first battle upon returning to the Central Continent had ended in humiliation. If not for his carelessness, if not for Li Zhengjing's Azure Dao Treasure, he would have won.

But now, his life force drained, he dared not linger.

"Today, I didn't lose to you—I lost to the Azure Dao Lord!" His voice echoed as he vanished. "When we meet again, you'll die!"

The octopus demon, attempting to flee, was torn apart by the dragon and its allies.

As the chaos settled, Li Zhengjing's expression darkened.

The first-generation Heavenly Venerable's power was terrifying. Even with all his strength, the dragon, Ghost Valley Lingguan, and the Luofu treasure, they'd barely survived. Without the Azure Dao Treasure's intervention, they'd have been doomed.

"What happened?" Li Zhengjing asked Ghost Valley Lingguan.

The latter held up the intestine. "A thousand years ago, he was at the end of his lifespan when he left. He should've used the Divine Stone for a second life—yet he's still in his original body."

Ghost Valley Lingguan frowned. "I suspect he prolonged his life by consuming the Azure Dao Lord's remains. He returned because... he'd exhausted that source."

"Also, he came for this." Li Zhengjing held up the cauldron. "Can he read the inscriptions inside?"
