# Chapter 108: Ambush

Li Shimin needed third-grade metal-attribute materials as a sword foundation to cultivate the "Sword Demon Secret Code" himself. Unfortunately, he had never encountered even second-grade materials outside of the storage bracelet obtained from Baili Jinyan, let alone third-grade metal-attribute ones. 

Fortunately, his doppelganger now possessed the "Sword Demon Secret Code," allowing his body-refining cultivation to continue. His gaze fell upon the last purple jade slip, hoping it contained Baili Jinyan's primary cultivation technique. If so, his doppelganger wouldn't need to change its main cultivation method, avoiding many complications.

The final purple jade slip contained a technique called "Soul Control and Separation Art." This wasn't a cultivation method but rather an auxiliary secret technique. The "Soul Control and Separation Art" allowed one to control a soul and, by stimulating its separated fragments, send them out as eyes or even use them to attack enemies covertly. 

Of course, the primary requirement for cultivating this technique was possessing spiritual sense. While it might seem similar to the Netherworld Sect's "Five Ghosts Soul Refining Banner," the "Soul Control and Separation Art" was far more advanced. The controlled soul would be strengthened by the technique and could recover after each separation. Moreover, the separated fragments could share vision with the cultivator, who could even control them remotely. In essence, this was a high-level soul manipulation technique.

Li Shimin exhaled deeply, marveling at the wonders of the cultivation world. When Baili Jinyan had threatened to extract his soul, he had thought it was mere bluster. He hadn't imagined such techniques truly existed.

Among the three purple jade slips, only the "Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique" could be cultivated immediately. The other two, "Sword Demon Secret Code" and "Soul Control and Separation Art," had prerequisites he couldn't meet yet. He decided to focus on the "Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique" first. Cultivation techniques were inherently discreet—unless he revealed it himself, no one would know he had learned this spiritual sense technique.

Next to the jade slips in the storage bracelet were several pill bottles. His spiritual sense swept over them, and he immediately noticed the label on one: "Foundation Establishment Pill."

"This is a Foundation Establishment Pill!" Li Shimin nearly exclaimed aloud. His excitement was understandable. Whether it was techniques or magical artifacts, everything served as a foundation for his progress. For a Qi Refining cultivator aiming to reach Foundation Establishment, the Foundation Establishment Pill was indispensable.

The sect offered Foundation Establishment Pills for exchange, but their prices were exorbitant. Carefully opening the labeled bottle, he found a second-grade pill emitting a red glow. Despite being only a mid-grade second-grade pill, no cultivator would seek higher-quality versions because the Foundation Establishment Pill was already the rarest among second-grade pills. Its refinement required numerous precious spiritual herbs. Rumor had it that the Nine Peaks' spiritual fields were largely dedicated to growing the herbs needed for this pill.

Even so, the annual production of Foundation Establishment Pills couldn't meet demand, given the sheer number of cultivators seeking to break through to Foundation Establishment.

Though he only had one pill, Li Shimin was thrilled. Accumulating 50,000 merit points would take him an unknown amount of time, and even then, the sect's inventory might not have the pill available. Even if he obtained one, he wasn't confident a single pill would guarantee his breakthrough.

As for why Baili Jinyan had only prepared one Foundation Establishment Pill—it was because his Heavenly Spiritual Root gave him a natural chance to break through without the pill. This single pill was likely just insurance to ensure his success.

Suppressing his excitement, Li Shimin reminded himself that he was still far from the late Qi Refining stage. There was plenty of time ahead. He resealed the bottle to prevent the pill's spiritual energy from dissipating. The bottle itself was a treasure, capable of preserving high-grade pills like the Foundation Establishment Pill for extended periods.

The other pills included Spirit Recovery Pills, Body Strengthening Pills, and Antidote Pills, among others. The rest of the storage bracelet contained miscellaneous items he decided to leave untouched for now. Perhaps as his strength grew, he might discover valuable unidentified items among them.

Returning his consciousness to his main body, Li Shimin sat within the Netherworld Shadow Formation and took out the Spirit Gathering Plate to practice the "Five Elements Absorption Technique." After days at sea on his paper crane, he hadn't dared to cultivate his primary technique, fearing sudden attacks from the ocean.

After completing his cultivation session, he stored the Spirit Gathering Plate back in his machine room space. Observing his meditating doppelganger, he pondered its situation.

One thing was certain: the doppelganger needed a new primary cultivation technique. Baili Jinyan's original technique wasn't in the storage bracelet, and even if Li Shimin knew its name, he couldn't obtain it. Any technique Baili Jinyan used would undoubtedly be top-tier for the Qi Refining stage.

Though Li Shimin's origins in the cultivation world were humble, his luck was decent. The "Five Elements Absorption Technique" he practiced had been assessed by Foundation Establishment Elder Cui as a top-tier Qi Refining technique. It was also the only viable technique he currently possessed, so he decided his doppelganger would cultivate it as well.

He placed the Spirit Gathering Plate under his doppelganger in the machine room space, where it gathered spiritual energy from the void, enveloping the doppelganger. Transferring his consciousness into the doppelganger's body, Li Shimin began cultivating the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" for the first time. Thanks to his main body's mastery, the process proceeded flawlessly.

The spiritual energy within the doppelganger's vortex was drawn out, converted through the technique, and then returned. The vortex's quality didn't diminish, but the sharp metallic attribute of Baili Jinyan's original technique softened, gaining a more balanced and inclusive nature.

However, the conversion wouldn't be completed in a day or two—it would take considerable time. Worse, he encountered a new problem: insufficient spiritual energy.

Since obtaining the Spirit Gathering Plate, Li Shimin had never worried about spiritual energy. This allowed him to choose a remote island with weaker spiritual energy for more personal time. Though the island's energy was sparse, the Spirit Gathering Plate compensated adequately.

Cultivators on the Nine Peaks didn't have unrestricted access to the main spiritual vein either. They had to spend most of their time completing assigned tasks, and their cave dwellings received energy based on strict quotas.

But the doppelganger was different—a peak ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator. Even after conversion, it would only drop to the early-to-mid ninth level. The Spirit Gathering Plate, though valuable, was inadequate for a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator, especially one with a Heavenly Spiritual Root.

After one cultivation session, not only was the plate's gathered energy exhausted, but the accumulated energy in the machine room space had also noticeably thinned. By Li Shimin's estimate, the plate needed two days to accumulate enough energy for one doppelganger session.

The underground spiritual vein at Eagle Beak Island, combined with the plate, might barely sustain half a day's cultivation. But the real issue was that he couldn't summon the doppelganger from the machine room space.

"It seems the conversion will take longer than expected." Without daily cultivation, the estimated time for conversion would more than double. Li Shimin resolved to complete the array master's tasks upon returning to the sect, earning enough merit to exchange for knowledge on spirit-gathering formations. Then, he could set up a superior formation in the machine room space to meet his energy needs.

Despite the setback, Li Shimin was satisfied. Analyzing the doppelganger's energy vortex, he concluded that the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" was comparable in quality to Baili Jinyan's original technique. This wasn't surprising—Qi Refining techniques were the most basic, and even the top-tier ones had circulated widely over the years.

Most sects required Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivators to practice the best Qi Refining techniques, as their talent could handle the difficulty. Ordinary Three Spiritual Roots cultivators, however, were neither encouraged nor recommended to choose top-tier techniques. While these techniques produced higher-quality spiritual energy, they demanded greater talent and slowed progress.

Had Li Shimin not discovered the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" himself—a relatively mild top-tier technique—and advanced rapidly to the third level of Qi Refining, Elder Cui wouldn't have advised him to keep it. In Elder Cui's eyes, the technique's compatibility with Li Shimin explained his swift progress.

Putting away the Netherworld Shadow Formation, Li Shimin felt he had rested enough. Eager to return to the sect, he decided to continue using "Sword Control Art" and his paper crane to reach his mission location faster.

Longstone Valley was a lengthy ravine filled with rocks and almost devoid of greenery. Han Yu and nine other clan members hid in dug-out holes, draped in cloth that concealed their auras. Combined with the holes, this maximized their stealth.

Like seasoned hunters, they guarded the valley's only passage, waiting for their prey. A sword light appeared at the valley's entrance—the spiritual energy fluctuations told Han Yu their target had arrived.

They had waited four days. Aside from sect disciples, few cultivators ventured from the spirit-rich sea into the mundane world's energy-barren lands. Rogue cultivators in the Southern Mountain Kingdom wouldn't dare approach the Heavenly Sea Sect's waters, where unidentified cultivators were unwelcome.

Thus, the only recent traveler through this route had to be the fourth-level Qi Refining sect disciple. If they killed the wrong person, well—it was the victim's misfortune, and they'd still profit.

"What's happening?" Han Yu peeked out at the sword light traversing the valley, confused. They had set up a formation in the valley using a formation disk, designed to trap anyone passing through. Once inside, the target would be immobilized, vulnerable to attacks from the ten cultivators outside.

This tactic had succeeded many times before. But this sect disciple—what was going on?

No one answered Han Yu's question because no one understood either. 

Li Shimin, traveling via "Sword Control Art," sensed the formation's energy fluctuations but didn't stop. Encased in the sword light, his eyes traced the formation's energy lines. 

The formation set up by the rogue cultivators was inferior even to the simplest formations Elder Zhuge had taught him—the gap between sect and rogue cultivator inheritances was vast. While an average sect disciple might be affected, Li Shimin wasn't. The formation didn't even slow his sword light as he passed through effortlessly.

Emerging from the valley, he halted and looked back, his eyes flashing with killing intent. Now he understood what the law-enforcement disciple Han Tianlei had intended. The mission map had been provided by Han Tianlei, and this route had been rigged with a trapping formation. Han Tianlei's motives were clear.

Li Shimin summoned a drone and donned a visor. The drone, enhanced with "Invisibility Art," ascended, its infrared function activating. Ten red figures appeared on the display, revealing the enemies' positions. 

Now, he held the advantage. Whether to fight or ambush was his choice.

"Fight," Li Shimin muttered coldly.
