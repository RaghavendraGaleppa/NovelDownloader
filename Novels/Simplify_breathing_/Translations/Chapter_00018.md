## Chapter 18: Haggling

Disguise was purely Chen Fei's contingency plan. After all, he was soon going to sell Grass Reversion Pills in the black market, and going there with his current appearance and build would make him easily recognizable. The black market was an almost open secret among Pingyin County's martial artists, and members of the Zhang family were bound to be there. Chen Fei didn't want to break ties with the Zhang family yet, so concealing his identity was crucial.

"Disguise skill is simplifying... Simplification successful... Disguise skill → Washing face!"

Amazing!

Seeing the simplified result, Chen Fei grinned. He tried washing his face with clean water, and indeed, the experience points for Disguise skill increased by 1. At the same time, some insights into the Disguise skill emerged in his mind. Without delay, Chen Fei repeatedly rinsed his face with clean water over ten times, and the experience points for Disguise skill rapidly increased.

A moment later, Chen Fei stopped. While washing his face wasn't slow for gaining experience, Chen Fei wanted to be faster. Based on his observations over the past few days, there were still tricks to exploit with this simplified method. Chen Fei tried dampening a towel and wiping his cheek, and relevant insights into Disguise skill immediately increased. A smile couldn't help but appear on Chen Fei's face.

In the following days, Chen Fei took one Grass Reversion Pill daily, steadily pushing his cultivation to the peak of the Skin Refining realm, while continuously refining Qi and Blood Pills to boost the Grass Reversion Pill's experience points, gradually approaching the perfect realm.

Although there was clearly no sweat on his head or face and he appeared perfectly clean, Chen Fei would still occasionally wipe his cheeks. It almost felt like Chen Fei was going to rub his face raw. Chen Fei paid no mind to their stares; there was nothing wrong with being clean. Moreover, as he watched the experience points for various cultivation methods continuously rise, his mind was filled with a torrent of insights. This feeling of accomplishment and abundant knowledge deeply intoxicated Chen Fei.

"Something big happened."

Early in the morning, Liu Jun mysteriously approached Chen Fei. Chen Fei nodded, signaling Liu Jun to continue.

"Weren't several prominent households in the county killed a few days ago? Last night, the county yamen's constables and bailiffs were dispatched to apprehend someone."

Chen Fei's expression shifted slightly. No wonder he had heard a commotion outside last night; it was caused by this incident. He couldn't help but recall the portrait he had thrown into the yamen.

"Did they catch him?"

"No, they didn't. I heard the bandit was a bit slow to react at first, but once the constables got close, he instantly injured everyone and then fled."

At the same time, Chen Fei's cultivation was estimated to break through within the next few days, at which point he would become a Muscle Refining realm martial artist. Compared to the lowliness of the Skin Refining realm, the Muscle Refining realm would at least give Chen Fei some self-preservation capabilities.

The black market.

"I need a batch of medicinal herbs. Can you supply them?"

In front of a bookstall, wearing a masked bamboo hat, his face had also been altered – specifically, the corners of his eyes were deliberately elongated, and his stature slightly increased, giving off an overall impression of coldness and inaccessibility.

"With money, anything is possible."

Chi Defeng looked at Chen Fei, feeling a sense of familiarity. However, with people coming and going in the black market, some familiarity was normal.

"I want ten portions of these herbs!"

Chen Fei handed over the written list. Chi Defeng took it, glanced at it a few times, and said, "They're not hard to find. Market price plus 100%. Delivery in six days. How does that sound?"
