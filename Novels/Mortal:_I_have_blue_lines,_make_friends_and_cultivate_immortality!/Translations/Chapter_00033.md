# Chapter 33: "Ye Ming: 'Young People Shouldn't Be So Hot-Headed!'"

"Hmm? And you are?" Ye Ming looked at Lin Yun with confusion. 

When had such an arrogant fellow appeared in the Yellow Maple Valley? He had memorized all the influential figures in the valley—who could be provoked, who couldn't, and who deserved a smiling welcome. These were essential skills for someone in his position as a steward.

After all, unlike those Foundation Establishment cultivators who had Core Formation elders as their masters—those who still held hope of forming a golden core and stepping onto the path of Core Formation—stewards like him would likely leave this world with their current cultivation level unless they encountered some great opportunity.

After some thought, Ye Ming confirmed that this Lin Yun wasn't on his list of people to be wary of. However, seeing the Huang Maple Valley's Chen family cultivators standing behind him, he knew this person wasn't someone to be trifled with.

As for the accusation of seizing a Foundation Establishment Pill—well, he had only taken one from a newly admitted pseudo-spiritual root disciple. No, not taken—he had *bought* it.

"Master—what do we do now?" Ye Long, standing behind Ye Ming, glanced nervously at the agitated crowd outside. He wasn't truly worried about his master's safety but rather feared that his Foundation Establishment Pill might be taken away. If that happened, his only chance to obtain another would be to enter the Bloody Forbidden Land—a place with a survival rate of only twenty to thirty percent. He didn't have the guts for that.

"Don't panic! That Foundation Establishment Pill was purchased fair and square by me. This man is merely a Qi Condensation cultivator—he won't find it so easy to snatch food from my hands!" Ye Ming reassured his grandson, recognizing his anxiety.

As an old hand at exploiting disciples for years, Ye Ming had long since developed methods to handle such situations. Several disciples had previously protested his deductions from their spirit stones and even reported him to the sect leader, yet he had easily resolved those incidents.

All he needed was to hold out for today. Once they returned, he would immediately have Ye Long consume the pill—there wouldn't be enough time to refine a Qi Condensation Pill. By then, with the pill gone, what could this man possibly do? 

Ye Ming was already old. If necessary, he could simply leave the Yellow Maple Valley with his grandson. A Foundation Establishment cultivator would be welcomed anywhere. This Foundation Establishment Pill was his grandson's only hope for advancement—he couldn't possibly hand it over.

"Junior Nephew, your claim that I *seized* your brother's Foundation Establishment Pill is utterly false!" Ye Ming declared. "I purchased it fairly! Ye Long can vouch for me, and so can Junior Brother Wu from the Scripture Transmission Hall."

For now, Ye Ming would stick to denial and muddy the waters. He just needed to endure today.

"Y-yes! My master bought it with spirit stones!" Ye Long chimed in. "That Han Li, a mere pseudo-spiritual root cultivator, knew he had no hope of reaching Foundation Establishment, so he begged my master to buy it. My master didn't even want it at first, but Han Li pleaded repeatedly, so he reluctantly agreed!"

In the crowd, Nie Ying nodded. "That does make sense. If he offered something of equivalent value, it would be hard for a Qi Condensation cultivator to refuse."

She seemed to believe that someone like Han Li, with his poor spiritual roots, might indeed have sought to sell his Foundation Establishment Pill to an elder.

A nearby Qi Condensation disciple spat on the ground in disgust. "Pah! Senior Sister, don't be fooled by that Ye scoundrel's lies! What 'purchased'? It was outright theft! And given Ye Ming's stingy nature, he probably gave Han Li nothing but trash!"

"Ah? Is that so?" Nie Ying looked startled.

"Hah!" Lin Yun let out a cold laugh. "Purchased? You expect us to believe that?"

He took the storage pouch from Han Li and held it up for all to see. "Everyone, take a good look! These are the items Ye Ming used to 'buy' my brother's Foundation Establishment Pill. See for yourselves what's inside!"

"Two mid-grade spirit stones! Dozens of low-grade ones! Three high-grade magical tools! Twenty-three low-grade talismans! All this combined isn't even worth a thousand spirit stones—barely over five hundred! Meanwhile, a Foundation Establishment Pill is worth at least *two thousand* spirit stones!"

"Is this what you call a *purchase*? Giving five hundred spirit stones' worth for something worth two thousand? This isn't buying—it's outright extortion!" Lin Yun roared righteously.

"Extortion!"  
"Extortion!"  
"Extortion!"  

The surrounding rogue cultivators joined in, their voices rising like tidal waves.

"Even if Han Li is just a Qi Condensation disciple, taking his Foundation Establishment Pill for so little is despicable!" Nie Ying said indignantly.

In this cold, ruthless world of cultivation where everyone looked out only for themselves, someone like Lin Yun—willing to stand up for others—was a rare sight. Watching him defend Han Li, Nie Ying smiled faintly, feeling as though she had found a kindred spirit. A man who acted with chivalry and justice was exactly the type she admired.

Her judgment of people had never been based on appearance or cultivation level but on their willingness to help others, as Lin Yun was doing now. In the original storyline, she had smiled at the stocky youth who shielded the Murong brothers from Lu Yunfeng's attack, while offering only admonishment to the self-serving Han Li—reflecting her values.

Even Xiang Zhili observed the scene silently from the crowd. Initially, he had tagged along out of amusement, but his interest in Lin Yun had grown slightly. The man was like a splash of warm color in the otherwise gray and indifferent world of cultivation.

Xiang Zhili wasn't sure how to evaluate Lin Yun's actions. Those he helped would naturally feel gratitude. Bystanders might admire him or simply enjoy the spectacle. But would *he* ever step forward like this? Never—even if it were a trivial matter he could resolve with a flick of his hand.

Was Ye Ming truly in the wrong? In this world of cultivation, who didn't bully the weak? And who hadn't *been* bullied? Perhaps his only mistake was not being strong enough. Had he been a Core Formation elder or a Nascent Soul cultivator, would Lin Yun have dared confront him?

Seeing Lin Yun display the contents of the storage pouch, Ye Ming's face darkened briefly. But as a seasoned schemer, he had faced similar situations before.

"Junior Nephew Han, is this storage pouch the one I gave you?" Ye Ming asked calmly.

"Yes," Han Li nodded.

"Are you certain?" Ye Ming pressed.

"Yes!" Han Li affirmed. "This is all you gave me."

"Then these are *not* the items I gave you!" Ye Ming suddenly exploded, pointing accusingly at Han Li. "I clearly gave you *two* top-grade magical tools—both exquisite pieces worth eight hundred spirit stones each! Those alone are worth sixteen hundred! Add the three high-grade tools, two mid-grade spirit stones, and the dozens of low-grade ones, and the total exceeds two thousand spirit stones!"

"Junior Nephew Han, you must have hidden those two eight-hundred-spirit-stone treasures to frame me!"

Having turned the tables, Ye Ming stroked his mustache and addressed Lin Yun with a patronizing tone. "Junior Nephew Lin, you're new to the Yellow Maple Valley and inexperienced in the ways of the world. It's easy for you to be deceived by those with ulterior motives. This could strain relations between us."

"Young people shouldn't be so hot-headed—you'll only bring trouble upon yourself!" He emphasized the last four words.

"You—!" Han Li trembled with rage at Ye Ming's shameless reversal. With only the two of them knowing the truth of what had been exchanged, the situation had become impossible to clarify.

"Brother Lin, believe me, he really only gave me these things," Han Li pleaded urgently.

Lin Yun raised a hand to stop him. He understood.

"This old dog is far too practiced at this—he must have done it countless times before!"
