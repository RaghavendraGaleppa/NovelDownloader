# Chapter 32: Chaos in the Wilderness

Of course, the most outrageous were the pills that increased magical power.  

Pills like the Wood-attribute Green Sprout Pill, Earth-attribute Yellow Ginseng Pill, Fire-attribute Flaming Cloud Pill, Metal-attribute Golden Marrow Pill, Water-attribute Azure Water Pill, and Yin-attribute Ghost Mushroom Pill... all started at thirty spirit coins. Each additional pill mark increased the price by three coins.  

Unaffordable. Absolutely unaffordable.  

Wang Chan couldn't help but envy the disciples of sects and noble families—they probably treated such pills like candy.  

Of course, the reality was that although pills were beneficial, they couldn't be overused.  

The magical power gained from consuming pills was unstable and required time to consolidate one's foundation.  

Moreover, frequent and excessive use of pills for cultivation had another major drawback—  

A weak foundation made breaking through bottlenecks significantly harder compared to those who cultivated steadily step by step.  

The bottlenecks between the early, middle, late, and peak stages of Qi Refinement were unavoidable for the vast majority of cultivators, whether they followed the righteous path, the demonic path, or unorthodox methods.  

Naturally, those with Heavenly or Earth-grade spiritual roots were exceptions.  

Legend had it that cultivators with Earth-grade or Heavenly-grade spiritual roots faced no barriers when building their foundations—once their cultivation reached the required level, success came naturally.  

The truth was, disciples from sects and noble families—those below the Heavenly-grade spiritual root but with promising futures—trained even harder than ordinary rogue cultivators.  

With guidance from their elders, they avoided short-sightedness and reckless advancement. They wouldn't rely on pills for rapid progress in a short time.  

Instead, they progressed steadily, step by step.  

Only when their magical foundation was solid and necessary would they use pills to give themselves a boost, or consume large quantities to break through bottlenecks.  

"As long as my foundation remains stable, using pills to gain two additional strands of magical power a year shouldn’t be a problem. That way, I could gain six strands annually, and in less than twenty years, I might have a chance to build my foundation!"  

Wang Chan thought eagerly, then instinctively opened his storage pouch. Seeing the ten spirit coins and twenty-one spirit pearls inside, he sighed.  

Reality was harsh.  

Despite his previous savings and decent earnings this month, the cost of cultivation resources and necessities had nearly depleted his funds.  

Still, it wasn’t a major issue. With his current abilities, he would eventually reach a point where he could treat pills like candy.  

"Tomorrow, I’ll head to Green Bamboo Mountain with Fellow Daoist Ning to assess Fellow Daoist Qu’s situation. If things don’t work out, I’ll return to the market stall early. Even if I have to coax and persuade customers, I must earn at least four spirit coins. And if any lucrative medical opportunities arise, I won’t let them slip by!"  

Wang Chan made his plans in silence.  

---  

The next day.  

Dawn had yet to break.  

Wang Chan was asleep, dreaming of massaging the female cultivator in the apricot-yellow Daoist robe when suddenly the beauty mark barged in, pushing the robed woman aside. She climbed onto the jade bed, demanding to know whom he would choose.  

Wang Chan wasn’t about to indulge her. He raised his hand to slap her, ready to assert dominance—when he abruptly woke up.  

*Thud.*  

*Thud, thud.*  

"Fellow Daoist Wang, it’s me!"  

Someone was knocking at the door. The voice belonged to Hunchback Zhang—had the man actually returned?  

Wang Chan got up, still lingering in the remnants of his dream.  

Lately, he’d been having these strange dreams every few days. He wasn’t sure if it was due to pent-up frustration or the influence of his cultivation technique.  

After dressing, he stepped into the courtyard and opened the gate. There stood Hunchback Zhang, beaming with vigor, hands clasped in greeting.  

Just as Wang Chan was about to return the gesture, he noticed a graceful woman standing beside Zhang. Though only at the early stage of Qi Refinement, she carried herself with poise, her charming face wearing a polite smile.  

"This is the Fellow Daoist Wang I’ve often mentioned—Physician Wang, whose Rejuvenation Needle technique is unmatched in Lotus Mountain." Hunchback Zhang immediately pulled the woman forward. "Quick, greet him."  

The woman bowed obediently.  

Wang Chan returned the courtesy but didn’t pry further.  

"This is Luo Bing. She’ll be helping me tend the spirit fields from now on." After a brief introduction, Hunchback Zhang retrieved a small jade pouch from his storage bag and handed it over. "I’ve grown some mid-grade Blood Tusk Rice. Take some home to try."  

Wang Chan accepted it instinctively, estimating the pouch held about three catties.  

Mid-grade Blood Tusk Rice was rarely sold in the Black River Market—it cost at least one spirit coin per catty, and ordinary rogue cultivators couldn’t even get their hands on it.  

Hunchback Zhang had been gone for months, yet now he was throwing around such generosity?  

Moreover, compared to his exhausted state last time, he now brimmed with energy.  

A realization struck Wang Chan. "Fellow Daoist Zhang, have you become a mid-grade spirit farmer?"  

"Just luck, just luck." Hunchback Zhang smiled modestly before signaling the woman to return to the cave dwelling. He then stayed to chat with Wang Chan.  

Wang Chan invited him inside, serving spirit tea as they talked.  

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Wang, do you remember Tang Song from Cave Dwelling Eighty-One?" Hunchback Zhang suddenly asked mid-conversation.  

Wang Chan’s expression remained neutral. "Have you seen Fellow Daoist Tang?"  

After their falling out at the Black River Market, Tang Song had vanished—never returning to Lotus Mountain or the market, leaving Wang Chan with no way to track him down.  

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Tang made a foolish mistake. Somehow, he joined the Black Eagle Gang." Hunchback Zhang sighed regretfully. "A while back, he was treating the wife of He Changkong, one of the gang’s thirty-six lieutenants, and did something he shouldn’t have. When caught, his foundation was shattered, and he was sent to mine in a cave a thousand miles away."  

Having one’s foundation destroyed and being forced into slave labor was worse than death.  

"What did Fellow Daoist Tang do to provoke such cruelty from He Changkong?" Wang Chan feigned sympathy while secretly relishing the news. "Was he caught in bed with her?"  

"Not quite." Hunchback Zhang’s expression turned suggestive. "They say Fellow Daoist Tang merely removed her shoes and socks and used his Greenwood Restoration Finger technique to massage her... delicate feet."  

What?  

A foot massage?  

How could that warrant such hatred?  

Wang Chan was stunned into silence before finally saying, "Massaging the feet to unblock qi flow is perfectly normal. He Changkong must be extremely narrow-minded."  

Though he spoke lightly, Wang Chan felt a chill. He had performed foot massages and full-body treatments himself—if such things were grounds for retribution, wasn’t he in danger?  

Surely not.  

"Heh..." Hunchback Zhang chuckled meaningfully. "Tell me, Fellow Daoist Wang, would you ever massage a male cultivator’s feet? The kind where you remove their shoes and socks?"  

Wang Chan: "..."  

"Speaking of which, ever since those northern cultivators migrated south, the White Mountain region has grown increasingly chaotic." Hunchback Zhang changed the subject, his tone uneasy.  

"Half a month ago, after the Red Leaf Gang was wiped out overnight by ghosts, the Black Eagle Gang rose abruptly. With nine late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators and thirty-six mid-stage lieutenants expanding their influence, they’ve become the dominant faction within two thousand miles of Lotus Mountain."  

"Indeed." Wang Chan sighed in agreement.  

In just a month, the White Mountain region had undergone drastic changes. The influx of southern migrants had led to widespread disorder.  

The wilderness was in chaos, but White Mountain City was worse. The migrants weren’t just rogue cultivators—entire Qi Refinement clans and even Foundation Establishment families had relocated.  

Rumors even spoke of a broken Yin God family settling here, intending to take root.
