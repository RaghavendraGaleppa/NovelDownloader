# Chapter 26: Traces Vanish in the Snow

Fang Mushan had not finished speaking when Li Haomiao cut in, "In Yujing, he might make the list, but he would still be far from the top. The world is full of prodigies like carp in a river. Remember to remain humble and avoid arrogance."

Fang Mushan glanced at Li Haomiao and said no more.

Xu Yunfan paid them no mind; his attention was mostly immersed in his cultivation. He discovered that practicing the Red Chain Cloak Hammer Technique increased his proficiency far more efficiently than mining. However, he did not neglect the skill of mining. In this eight-hundred-mile frozen wasteland, having a relatively comfortable place to rest was largely thanks to this skill. The others who had fled, if they could not keep out the cold in time or find adequate shelter from the wind, would have a slim chance of survival in such harsh conditions where temperatures fluctuated drastically, dropping to minus ten degrees or more in the middle of the night, even if they had entered the martial path.

Fang Mushan, sitting nearby and slowly turning the roasting meat, was momentarily dazed. After a long while, his expression calmed down again.

"My father said some things to me back then," he said. "Now I finally understand a little. I'm afraid he anticipated this."

Li Haomiao nodded and praised, "General Fang was a master of warfare and extremely sensitive to the political situation in the court. To endure, he had no choice but to resort to such a strategy. Mushan, don't feel wronged. Once we bring that wicked woman down, there will be a time to vent our frustrations. Once we leave this eight-hundred-mile frozen wasteland, come with me. I'll take you to meet someone who will give you the answers you seek."

Fang Mushan fell silent for a moment, then nodded and said no more.

Xu Yunfan wanted to say something, but seeing Li Haomiao's expression that seemed to say, "If you dare to run your mouth, I won't teach you any martial arts," he smacked his lips and continued to practice the Red Chain Cloak Hammer Technique.

He had not yet reached his physical limit; he only stopped after exhausting himself completely each time.

When he rested, under Li Haomiao's murderous gaze, Xu Yunfan calmly swallowed a Gubu Pill and ate twenty pounds of bear meat. Then, he turned his back, formed the Hand Seal of the Character 'Lin', and silently recited the 'Supreme Goodness is Like Water' Heart Mantra. Gradually, his mind entered a state of seeming emptiness.

*You formed the hand seal and practiced the Lin Seal once. You felt a flash of inspiration, but upon careful contemplation, you found nothing. The proficiency of the Lin Seal seems to have increased.*

*You...*

The information prompts on his attribute panel did not surprise him. Over the past dozen or so days, every time he cultivated the Lin Seal, the attribute panel's notifications were more or less the same. However, he could clearly feel that after each cultivation session, the duration of the next session would be longer.

A long time passed. Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, his expression full of exhaustion but his gaze filled with joy. He could clearly sense that he had sustained the cultivation of the Lin Seal for at least one minute longer than the day before.

He rolled over and fell into a deep sleep.

The next morning, just as the horizon was turning pale, Fang Mushan was already busy outside the cave. A simple grill was set up over a roaring bonfire, the remaining bear meat sizzling on the fire. Fat dripped into the flames, making a crackling sound and releasing an enticing aroma.

The three of them sat together and feasted until their stomachs were bulging and they could not swallow another bite before stopping contentedly.

All three were martial artists with enormous appetites. After the two large and one small brown bears were devoured without restraint, only a few strips of meat were left, which they hung on their bodies to dry as rations.

Xu Yunfan put on the sewn bear fur clothes and took a gentle sniff. "It's a pity. If we had two more days, the strange smell of this bear fur would be completely gone."

Hunting was not a particularly sophisticated skill, but it covered a wide range. There were simple, crude methods for tanning animal hides, which allowed them to temporarily escape the threat of the cold. With bear fur boots, bear fur clothes, plus the previously hunted岩羊 (rock goat) and yak hides, Xu Yunfan stood in the biting wind but felt his body warm and cozy.

Li Haomiao stroked the thick bear fur cloak he was wearing. "If this were in Yujing, after fine tanning, it would fetch at least two hundred taels of silver."

"It'll be a bit difficult for you to return to Yujing in this lifetime."

Li Haomiao let out a cold snort, his eyes flickering with an indescribable light. "One day, I will bring that wicked woman down."

Ignoring Li Haomiao, Xu Yunfan walked out of the bear cave and looked up at the gloomy sky. He saw snowflakes falling in a flurry.

"It's snowing."

Fang Mushan's expression tightened as he said in a deep voice, "We must speed up. We are already in winter. If we don't get out before the heavy snow seals the mountains, this eight-hundred-mile frozen wasteland would be a death sentence even for a First-Rank Martial Teacher."

"But there is good news. With this heavy snow, all our tracks will be covered."

Li Haomiao's expression relaxed slightly. "As long as it's not the weirdos from the Imperial Observatory leading the pursuit, we are essentially free."

The two dared not delay any further. Xu Yunfan quickly hoisted Li Haomiao onto his back and sped forward like the wind.

These past few days, they had been rushing along and had already traveled over six hundred miles.

The two of them were agile, and many perilous peaks and deep ravines that would be impassable for ordinary people were as level as ground to them, allowing them to climb over easily, which saved them a great deal of time.

"If we push on, we might be out by dawn tomorrow."

"He's dead?"

Zhang Shuyang's face instantly turned as dark as ink. He stared fixedly at Xu Yun's corpse. The gruesome state of his death made him press his lips tightly together, unable to speak for a long time.

Xu Yun had followed him for many years. As his personal guard, he had survived countless battlefield skirmishes unscathed, only to lose his life here. This filled Zhang Shuyang with both anger and sorrow.

A cripple, a mere First-Rank Small Success martial artist, and a slave—it should have been a sure thing.

Zhang Shuyang slowly knelt down, his gaze lingering on Xu Yun's face for a long time.

He slowly rose to his feet. The armor on his body clanged crisply as he moved, a sound that was particularly jarring in the silent snowfield.

At that moment, the goose-feather snow falling from the sky did not touch his body. Within three inches of him, it was instantly vaporized, turning into clouds of mist and disappearing.

It was the surging blood energy within him, churning violently, making the temperature around him extremely high, like a volcano on the verge of erupting, suppressing endless anger and frustration.

Xu Yun was his comrade-in-arms on the battlefield. For many years, the two had fought side by side with perfect默契 (tacit understanding). Zhang Shuyang had always placed high hopes on him.

He suppressed the turbulent emotions in his heart and walked step by step to the foot of the giant boulder where Li Miaojun stood.

Li Miaojun wore a thin gauze dress, resembling an ice fairy amidst the swirling snow. The icy world around her blended with her calm temperament, as if the cold of this world could not get close to her in the slightest.

Zhang Shuyang knelt on one knee, performing a standard half-kneeling salute. His voice carried a hint of helplessness and caution. "Commander Li, they are likely still inside. We have lost our best tracker, and with the heavy snow covering everything, tracking them will be as difficult as reaching the sky."
