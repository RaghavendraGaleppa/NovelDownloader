# Chapter 144: Terrifying Talent

When Xu Yunfan arrived at the Tiangong Department's academy, he stood at the entrance, listening to the voices coming from inside.

"Remember, when it comes to building our own Tiangong Cavern, our Tiangong Department naturally follows the four-character principle of 'eat, take, block, demand'."

"Teacher Zhang, what are these four characters?"

Another slightly immature voice spoke up, filled with innocent curiosity.

The voice of Zhang Yue, steward of the Tiangong Cavern, carried an undeniable authority as he replied.

"Naturally, 'eat' means to thoroughly digest the blueprints, 'take' means to take with basis, 'block' means to block according to regulations, and 'demand' means to demand results. Over the years of cooperation between our Tiangong Department and the Mechanism Hall, we have undertaken most of the construction of the entire Tiangong Fortress. Now that the Azure Dragon Winch is activated, it is as solid as a fortress. Even a Marrow Cleansing Grandmaster would be helpless against it, which shows its strength."

"What about externally?"

Zhang Yue's tone shifted.

"Remember this: over the years, the Tiangong Cavern has built a Tiangong Fortress, costing a astronomical amount of money. This is still based on the free labor from the Melting Gold Hall mining all day. Otherwise, the cost would be several times higher. Externally, we naturally eat when invited, take when given, block when not given, and demand when there is none. We must eat with peace of mind, take with confidence, block as we wish, and demand with satisfaction..."

Xu Yunfan: "..."

When he walked out of the Tiangong Department's academy and saw a crowd of teenagers laughing and talking as they left, Xu Yunfan's eyes showed some emotion.

"Time is the best medicine."

Steward Zhang Yue of the Tiangong Department walked to Xu Yunfan's side, watching the backs of these teenagers.

"The Tiangong Cavern has been established for 1,023 years. It has experienced six crises of near destruction and more than a dozen times when the disciples were nearly wiped out. Yet, the founders of each generation managed to pull through, whether by bowing and scraping to survive or standing tall to defend to the death. The founders of each generation have done it all. Merits and faults will be judged by later generations.

These are the future of the Tiangong Department. There are many promising talents among them, perhaps a few figures like Hall Master Wan will emerge."

At this point, Zhang Yue couldn't help but sigh.

"In the end, we cannot be like the Six Great Sects, swallowing up vast territories and gathering all the outstanding talents of the world."

Xu Yunfan was silent for a moment, then said softly, "There will be such a day."

Although he had spent a long time in the Scripture Pavilion and read various professional books from the four halls and departments, he hadn't paid attention to the historical records of the Tiangong Cavern.

Zhang Yue also stopped reminiscing, turned, and walked into the courtyard first, saying, "Come in and talk first, Junior Brother Xu. Master has instructed me to teach you the complete Mountain-Bearing玄龟 Technique."

"Thank you!"

Xu Yunfan nodded in gratitude.

At the beginning of the Mao period (5-7 AM), in the true disciple's residence where Xu Yunfan lived in the Forging Hall, his nostrils flared as he occasionally inhaled the scent of sulfur mixed in the air.

The "External Three Unions" essential technique of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique surged through his flesh and blood: shoulders and hips unite, elbows and knees unite, hands and feet unite. His body, which had reached great perfection in training sinews, bones, and skin, was as taut as a bowstring, yet always fell short by a fraction.

"Crack!"

On the fifth attempt at "Three Unions into One," his right shoulder blade suddenly dislocated.

*Slap!*

With a light sound, the muscles writhed like steel cables, pulling the shoulder blade back into place. Xu Yunfan stared at his bleeding tiger's mouth, his brow deeply furrowed. He felt he was missing some crucial technique or secret, but the Pure Yang One Qi Technique didn't explain it, leaving him quite confused.

There must be some secret technique passed down orally within the Dao Sect, not recorded in the written manuals.

At noon, the magnetic compass in the underground mine shaft spun wildly.

Xu Yunfan pressed both palms against the rock wall. The blood energy fueled by the Melting Gold Forging Iron Technique resonated with the玄铁 ore vein.

A strange pulse came from deep within the strata, as if a primordial beast was breathing in and out gold energy.

"Seven zhang southwest, three cun down with the pick! It must be a piece of Blazing Fire Iron!"

Xu Yunfan's玄铁 mechanism mining pick struck the marked spot on the rock wall.

The moment the pick tip pierced in, the entire ore vein writhed like a living python. A three-hundred-pound piece of raw玄铁 ore burst out from the wall. As if dissected, a fist-sized piece of iron glowing with red light was revealed within!

Holding it in his hand, he felt his palm scorching hot.

This fist-sized piece of Blazing Fire Iron contained temperatures exceeding a hundred degrees.

Xu Yunfan said joyfully, "I remember in the Tiangong Forging Record, the main material for the divine weapon Fire Scale Sword was forged from this Blazing Fire Iron. The book describes that when the Fire Scale Sword is thrust out, underground fire surges, possessing an incredible burning power. The麒麟 blood mixed within further fuels the fire, capable of easily melting gold and iron."

When Yan Yuwei saw this scene, her expression was extremely complex. After a long while, she finally said.

"The Melting Gold Forging Iron Technique has achieved the integration of the Zhen, Kan, and Li strengths. Your ore-seeking and vein-distinguishing skills are proficient. You have... already graduated."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. He glanced sideways, and at that moment, a line of information appeared in his vision.

'Your Melting Gold Forging Iron Technique has reached Minor Accomplishment'

At the end of the Shen period (3-5 PM), the floor tiles of the Tiangong Department's training ground were covered in cracks.

Wan Chen's red copper giant axe struck Xu Yunfan's back, actually producing a sound like metal colliding.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. The Bear-Carrying stance of the Mountain-Bearing玄龟 Technique was pushed to its limit. The muscles beneath his skin layered like the patterns on an ancient turtle's shell, forcefully withstanding the downward chop of the giant axe.

"Hm?"

Wan Chen's originally casual gaze suddenly changed, becoming somewhat serious.

"Not hard enough!"

Wan Chen's axe blade suddenly changed technique, hidden force surging like a triple tide. "The玄龟 Strength isn't about stubbornly enduring, it's about borrowing force!"

The blue bricks beneath Xu Yunfan's feet shattered with a bang. The latissimus dorsi muscles undulated like waves, diverting seventy percent of the hidden force into the ground.

The remaining thirty percent circulated nine times within his body. The muscles trembled, the bones chirped like cicadas. Suddenly, it was rebounded from his palm, striking the giant axe. This was the profound principle of the Bear-Carrying Strength shifting mountains and filling seas!

It could be called borrowing force to strike force, but it was transmitted through his own muscles. After hard resistance, only thirty percent of the force combined with his own strength was sent out.

Although it had some flavor of Tai Chi, it was vastly different. If one's physical quality wasn't strong enough, without a tempered body as support, the body would be split in two just from withstanding the force.

Wan Chen retreated three steps violently, the axe handle spinning a blur in his palm. When he stopped and looked, there was actually a palm print on the axe head, sunken three cun deep, with the lines of the palm clearly visible.

His face turned green and white, and finally, he swore a curse.

"Damn it! I practiced for thirty years just to touch the threshold!"

At the Ke period (7-9 PM), the three hundred and sixty puppets in the Mechanism Hall's secret room opened their eyes simultaneously.

Mo Thirteen's fingers moved deftly, shooting out a hundred strands of Thousand Mechanism Threads, weaving a cage of heaven and net of earth around Xu Yunfan.

"The essence of the Hundred Refinements Coiling Silk Strength lies in the word 'silk.' Whether it's controlling mechanical beasts or mechanical puppets, it requires using the Coiling Silk Strength to exert force, manipulating the Thousand Mechanism Threads to control various mechanisms. If you want to make more exquisite mechanisms, the Coiling Silk Strength needs to be even more precise. Some components are so tiny even the Tiangong Department can't make them, relying solely on the Mechanism Hall's Coiling Silk Strength to craft them by hand bit by bit."
