# Chapter 3: The Green-Skirted Maiden

"Uncle Fu, how has that tenant farmer who joined our family been performing these past few days?"

After several days had passed, Li Wanlong suddenly remembered Wei Qian and inquired about his recent situation.

For a cultivation family, the most valued members were naturally those of their own bloodline. Outsider cultivators would never be easily trusted—it was common to observe them for seven or eight years before placing any faith in them.

Their wariness was understandable.

Any cultivation family that lacked such vigilance wouldn't survive beyond three generations.

Uncle Fu thought for a moment before replying, "He's been quite honest and diligent. These past few days, he's only traveled between his residence and the spirit fields. His lifestyle is very simple."

"The only change is that his cultivation has broken through—he's now at the second level of Qi Refining."

"Continue observing him. Notify me immediately if anything seems amiss," Li Wanlong responded before putting the matter of Wei Qian out of his mind.

A minor cultivator at the first or second level of Qi Refining couldn't possibly cause any trouble in Misty Ridge Mountain, where a Foundation Establishment ancestor presided.

Moreover, there were far more important matters demanding Li Wanlong's attention than concerning himself with a mere tenant farmer.

"The Blackwater Pond Wang family grows increasingly aggressive... Must we really marry Caiwei to the Xiao family?" The thought of the internal and external difficulties facing the Li clan filled Li Wanlong with inexplicable irritation.

"Father, what are you thinking about?"

A clear, melodious voice rang out as a green-skirted maiden entered.

Seeing the newcomer, the bitterness on Li Wanlong's face instantly vanished, replaced by a smile. "I was just chatting with Uncle Fu. You remember that new tenant farmer who joined our family recently?"

The green-skirted maiden blinked her bright eyes twice before recalling, "The one Uncle Fu took away that day?"

"Yes," Li Wanlong nodded. "Uncle Fu has been observing him these past few days. That young man has an exceptionally steadfast dedication to the Dao—he practices diligently every single day."

"Our family's younger generation lacks this kind of perseverance. It's enough to drive me mad."

Indeed, the current generation of Li family youths was somewhat disappointing. Seeing the family's legacy facing a lack of worthy successors, how could Li Wanlong not worry?

Li Caiwei was sensible enough to understand the heavy burdens her father carried and didn't disturb him for long.

After leaving, Li Caiwei walked with light steps past the terraced fields where spirit rice was cultivated.

At that moment, Wei Qian and Old Man Li were working in the fields. Rather than interrupting them, Li Caiwei stood to the side and quietly observed.

Feeling a pair of eyes scrutinizing him from behind, Wei Qian slightly furrowed his brows. "What's with this girl?"

Of course, he had noticed the maiden's arrival immediately.

As someone who had lived as a rogue cultivator, how could he lack such basic vigilance?

He turned around and addressed the youthful, beautiful maiden in green: "Miss, is there something you need help with?"

Li Caiwei's face immediately flushed slightly.

What could she say? That she was curious about him and wanted to take a look?

But she quickly straightened her posture and declared, "I'm here to supervise you! To see how well you're tending the fields and whether you're slacking off."

Supervise? Was this maiden an important figure among the Li family's upper echelons?

"Young Wei, don't neglect her. This is the family head's daughter, our Li family's young mistress!" Old Man Li's voice chimed in at just the right moment to make the introduction.

"So it's the young mistress. My apologies for not recognizing you earlier. Please supervise as you wish."

Wei Qian didn't attempt further conversation. This was a member of the main family—chatting with her would be openly slacking off right before everyone's eyes.

Li Caiwei observed for quite some time before finally having to admit that Wei Qian truly deserved her father's praise.

Seeing Wei Qian's diligence and dedication, even Li Caiwei felt somehow inspired.

"An outsider cultivator works so hard. As the family head's daughter, I can't afford to be inferior to him."

With this thought, Li Caiwei bit her lip and turned to leave.

Unaware that his actions had influenced the Li family's young mistress, Wei Qian now devoted himself wholeheartedly to his "farming" endeavors.

In this world, any skill mastered to profound levels could become a path to the Dao!

Cultivators had summarized these skills collectively as the "Hundred Arts of Cultivation."

The art corresponding to farming was that of the Spirit Farmer.

Being a mere tenant farmer could never satisfy him.

After all, a tenant farmer was a replaceable position—the Li family could substitute him at any time they wished.

A "Spirit Farmer" was different—it was a skilled profession. Even if he left the Li family, he would have many opportunities elsewhere in the Cultivation World of Zhao.

However, figuring out a Dao-worthy skill entirely on his own would be quite challenging.

The best approach would be to find a master to learn from.

Coincidentally, just as Wei Qian was wondering where to find a teacher, he discovered that one had been right beside him all along—Old Man Li was actually a Spirit Farmer.

Over the past few days, seeing Wei Qian's increasing proficiency with the "Spring Rain Technique," Old Man Li had entrusted more of the field irrigation tasks to him.

Meanwhile, Old Man Li leisurely wandered up to the mountain's tea gardens and medicinal herb fields.

Only then did Wei Qian realize that Old Man Li, who seemed like an ordinary mortal farmer, actually possessed the secondary profession of a mid-grade first-tier Spirit Farmer.

But how to become his disciple?

Putting himself in Old Man Li's position, Wei Qian doubted he would casually teach his family's techniques to an outsider either.

"Fertile water shouldn't flow to outsider's fields"—this principle held true everywhere.

"No need to rush. I'm still young. I can take my time and plan carefully."

The following days continued as uneventfully as before, with Wei Qian moving only between the spirit fields and his residence.

Until one day, when Uncle Fu came to deliver ten catties of "Emerald Crystal Rice" and two low-grade spirit stones, Wei Qian suddenly realized—a full month had already passed.

Having money was one thing, but he needed somewhere to spend it.

An idea occurred to Wei Qian, and he asked, "Uncle Fu, are there any markets nearby?"

Uncle Fu shook his head. "None. The nearest market is ten thousand li away."

"Was there something you wanted to buy?" Uncle Fu inquired, then added, "Although there's no permanent market here, to facilitate exchange, the local cultivation families gather every three months to hold a small trading fair."

"The hosting rotates among the families."

"Last time it was hosted by the Blackwater Pond Wang family. This time, it's our family's turn."

Just when he needed it most, the pillow arrived.

Wei Qian cupped his hands respectfully toward Uncle Fu but said, "I haven't decided what to buy yet. I'll see if anything suitable appears at the trading fair before making any purchases."

Uncle Fu chuckled and patted Wei Qian's shoulder. "Young man, don't squander your spirit stones recklessly! Don't buy anything that won't benefit your cultivation path."
