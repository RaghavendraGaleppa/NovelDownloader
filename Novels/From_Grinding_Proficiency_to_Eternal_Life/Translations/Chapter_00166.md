# Chapter 166: Is It That Difficult?

Forging with a hammer for years had built up Xu Yunfan’s arms, the muscles bunching like steel cables. He swung the armor-piercing hammer, carving a crescent arc through the air.

Before the hammer head could touch Zhan Yan’s clothes, the dragon-engraved handle collided with the iron ruler hidden in the old man's sleeve. Sparks flew, drawing a three-foot line of fire between them.

"The dragon engravings aren't just for decoration!" Zhan Yan slapped the hammer handle with his ruler, numbing Xu Yunfan’s tiger's mouth. "Listen up. The spiral groove at the seven-inch mark on this armor-piercing hammer corresponds to the twisting torque of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer. You must feel it out constantly!"

"Thank you, Master!"

While speaking words of gratitude, Xu Yunfan suddenly spun the armor-piercing hammer in his palm. The heavy hammer rotated like a millstone, the groove on the handle scraping against his palm lines with a piercing screech.

The weapon, which should have flown out of his grip, used the spiral force to rebound. The crescent blade of the hammer head grazed the white hair at Zhan Yan’s temple. The powerful wind pressure whipped Zhan Yan’s graying hair into a frenzy.

Zhan Yan didn't get angry; instead, he laughed. He stomped his foot on the iron anvil on the ground.

"Catch this! Let me see how far you've come!"

The three-hundred-pound black steel square platform flew up with a muffled whoosh, smashing toward the disciple's face with heavy wind pressure.

Having a Blood Transformation Realm expert personally sparring with him, Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't refuse. When he fought Su Zhenhe, the attribute panel hadn't popped up a single proficiency increase提示, which made him uninterested in the fight.

Watching the black steel platform fly toward him, Xu Yunfan’s waist and hips suddenly tilted into a strange angle. It was the "Golden Bell Slanting Hang" defensive stance from yesterday's Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer technique.

"Wrong!"

Zhan Yan’s shout was like thunder.

The moment the anvil touched the hammer head, Xu Yunfan felt his arm tendons jolt as if struck by lightning. The armor-piercing hammer handle trembled violently. The dragon-engraved groove transformed the rebound force into a spiral torque, rushing straight up his bones to his elbow joint.

Xu Yunfan stumbled back seven steps, leaving half-inch deep footprints in the blue bricks with every step. When he reached the third step, he suddenly twisted his waist and hips, channeling the remaining force into the ground. The footprints of the last four steps grew shallower. By the time he reached the wall, the blue bricks only showed spider-web cracks.

*‘You successfully blocked an attack from a Blood Transformation Realm expert using the force application method of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer technique. Your Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer proficiency has increased!’*

Xu Yunfan glanced at the information提示 floating in his vision and felt a slight stir in his heart. Ever since he learned the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer technique from Zhan Yan yesterday, a gray message had appeared in the memory column. He was close to入门 (Initial Proficiency).

"Seven steps to release force, three steps to dissolve force. You're catching on," Zhan Yan said, stroking his beard and nodding. However, he was secretly shocked. He had only explained the basics of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer technique to Xu Yunfan yesterday, and today he was already this proficient?

He could even use the force-releasing method of "Golden Bell Slanting Hang" so thoroughly. Compared to Fu Jin, Fu Jin’s execution of this move was simply unwatchable.

Even if he possessed true blood, it shouldn't be enough to grasp things so instantly, understand with a single explanation, and even deduce the rest from one example. The ten-step force卸力 (force dissipation) Xu Yunfan had just used hadn't even been taught to him yet.

But to prevent Xu Yunfan from becoming arrogant and complacent, Zhan Yan’s expression didn't show a trace of it. To hide the shock in his eyes, he turned his head, grabbed the cold wine beside him, and took a big gulp to suppress his inner turmoil.

Zhan Yan suddenly threw the leather water bag at his waist.

"Catch! Try the 'Overturning Wave Force'!"

The moment Xu Yunfan abandoned the hammer to catch the bag, the water bag suddenly exploded, scattering water droplets everywhere. Zhan Yan somehow produced three iron caltrops from nowhere, shooting them through the water curtain toward his disciple behind it.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes burned with focus and spotted them immediately. The long-handled armor-piercing hammer in his hand flipped like a loom. The heavy hammer’s swirling torque condensed the water droplets into a vortex. The moment the iron caltrops hit the water, they were deflected by half an inch, clanging as they embedded themselves into the wooden pillar behind him.

"Good!"

Zhan Yan’s eyes flashed with brilliance, and he couldn't help but praise him. The next instant, he grabbed a quenching tongs and stabbed them toward his disciple's ribs.

This scene made Xu Yunfan’s eyelids twitch, and he couldn't help but silently curse him for being despicable.

Xu Yunfan didn't retreat; instead, he advanced. He stomped his foot, and a force erupted from his soles, layering and advancing. The muscles all over his body rolled like waves, sending this power into his arms. The heavy hammer in his hand sliced like a blade into the inner side of the iron tongs.

This was the clever force used to pick up charcoal when forging—the forging technique from the Heavenly Craft Forging Art. The force of "four ounces moving a thousand pounds" passed along the tongs, actually pulling Zhan Yan’s killing move into empty air.

"Good technique for picking chestnuts from the fire!"

Zhan Yan abandoned the tongs and retreated a step, flexing his hands.

"Watch closely! This is the true meaning of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking!"

The callus-covered fist smashed into the anvil.

There were no flashy moves. It was just that blood energy instantly rose, pouring into the muscles, skin, and membranes, making his figure swell by a circle. The next instant, the impact force transmitted purely from his waist and legs exploded.

The moment the anvil surface dented, the edges actually curled up three inches of iron skin. A superior technique of converting vertical force into horizontal tearing instantly burst forth. The ground of the entire forging room shook with it, and the charcoal in the furnace dropped by half an inch.

A smile appeared on Zhan Yan’s face. He was indeed a veteran warrior. He hadn't施展 (displayed) this kind of clever force in a long time, but once he did, it was still just like in the old days.

"The force reaches a thousand jun, the hammer weighs enough to shake mountains. It walks the path of fierce and unbridled power, but inside it contains the meaning of 'the亢龙 (fierce dragon) has regret.' When the Ancestor of the Divine Weapon Ridge created this hammer technique, it was originally without return, moving forward without hesitation."

"But it was ultimately a bit crude. When the force was exhausted, a peer of the same realm found a trick and severely injured him. Returning to the sect heavily injured, he devoted his heart and blood to completing the soft force of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer, allowing this technique to reach the Marrow Cleansing Realm."

Zhan Yan’s face was full of emotion. "It has been nearly four hundred years since. Only now do I see a fist that combines hardness and softness, penetrating deep into the force."

He turned to Xu Yunfan. "You try."

Xu Yunfan raised the armor-piercing hammer still in his hand and struck the dented surface of the anvil.

Before the vibration from the hammer impact had subsided, Xu Yunfan suddenly twisted his wrist and shook his elbow. A second layer of force was pushed out from his shoulder blades, joint by joint. The already dented iron anvil emitted a dragon-like trembling sound. The curled iron skin on the edge was actually hammered flat again, leaving only double ring-shaped forging patterns on the surface.

"Stacking Wave Force?!"

Zhan Yan stroked the concentric circle patterns on the anvil, his eyes wide, his expression nearly distorted.

For a long time, a strange red light flushed over his wrinkled old face.

"It took me three years to practice this move back in the day, and you just打出 (executed) it like that?!"

"?"

Xu Yunfan blinked. "Master, is this move difficult?"

Yesterday, after he practiced the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer until it appeared in the skill column, although it was still gray, this force application felt natural to use.

Zhan Yan: "..."

A fresh breeze blew in through the ventilation pipe, making the robes of the master and disciple flutter.

After a long while, Zhan Yan said seriously, "We don't need to teach it step by step anymore. Since we are at it today, I will pass the complete Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer technique to you. Listen carefully."

"Thank you, Master!"

Zhan Yan: "..."

At that moment, the underground fire well suddenly erupted, and blue-purple tongues of flame licked the ceiling.

(There are still three chapters left, furiously typing away. I'm reading your comments too. Many useful suggestions I will listen to and correct, such as the positive feedback for proficiency. I will be more precise later, but it's hard to please everyone. I hope to gain the approval of most readers.)
