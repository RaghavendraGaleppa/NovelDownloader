# Chapter 688: The Wonders of the Golden Core

Dongming Zhenjun let out a muffled groan. She had intended to resist, but she felt Xu Yunfan's pure yang power interweaving with her own Nine Nether Mystic Evil.

The thunderfire qi touched her Nine Nether Mystic Evil spiritual power, cycling endlessly, causing her Nine Nether Mystic Evil and the Nightfall Dao Fruit to calm down simultaneously. Her cultivation base subtly advanced. This was indeed the mutual benefit of true laws.

"You even used karma secret techniques?!"

A smile appeared on Xu Yunfan's face.

"Don't you find it pleasant?"

Dongming Zhenjun didn't reply. She merely focused on refining the thunderfire qi within her body. For her, this was a supreme tonic.

After all, Xu Yunfan had greatly advanced her cultivation this time.

Nine Nether Evil Mist and purple-gold thunder intertwined and rose, completely engulfing the two figures—

Three days later, at the Primordial Origin Sect's Divine Thunder Mountain.

Xu Yunfan sat high atop the nine-tiered high seat of the Divine Thunder Palace on Divine Thunder Mountain. The qi around his body was harmonious and surging, appearing even more profound than when he had left the Atila World.

His cultivation session with Dongming Zhenjun, a convergence of thunder and fire, not only allowed him to initially refine the pure yang fire power of the Blazing Sun Dao Fruit but also used the Nine Nether Mystic Evil to quell the backlash from his newly acquired authority.

A message jade talisman at his fingertip turned to ash, and his calm voice rang through the great hall.

"Pass the order!"

The disciples standing solemnly below, led by Xuezhen, straightened up and bowed in acknowledgment.

"Please instruct, Zhenjun!"

"Immediately, in my name, issue the World Conscript Edict. All peaks under the Primordial Origin Sect, vassal families, and loose cultivator alliances are to dispatch elders at the mid Foundation Establishment realm or above, and disciples at the mid Qi Condensation realm or above, to assemble at the World-Breaking Platform within ten days. Those who delay or disobey the order will have their resource quotas stripped, be expelled from the sect, and utterly annihilated."

"Open the sect's Treasury, Vault A3 and A7. Allocate thirty Void-Piercing Ships, five hundred Mystic Yin World-Breaking Talismans, and a hundred Soul-Suppressing Evil Banners. Additionally, draw one hundred thousand top-grade spirit stones and one million mid-grade spirit stones as expedition supplies."

"Instruct the Heavenly Work Hall to fully inspect and repair the Teleportation Array's discs and flags within three days, to accompany the army on the expedition."

Although the Primordial Origin Sect was a demonic sect, every command issued meant a massive amount of contribution points would be released. As long as one was a disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect, no one would refuse. Ninety-nine percent of them would rush over at the mere scent of it; there was basically no coercion involved.

In the territory governed by the Primordial Origin Sect, the law of the jungle was nakedly exposed. If you didn't go, but your enemies did, and they returned with greatly advanced cultivation, then you would be the one suffering.

For Xu Yunfan, now that he was the Divine Thunder Zhenjun, a true core disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect affirmed by the Dao Lord, these contribution points were merely numbers.

The Primordial Origin Sect possessed over a dozen major worlds and vast resources. What Xu Yunfan used was merely a drop in the bucket.

Command after command fell like thunder. Apart from the dharma lineages under other Zhenjuns, the Foundation Establishment peaks under the Primordial Origin Sect began to operate rapidly.

Xuezhen quickly recorded on a jade slip, sweat faintly appearing on his forehead.

He knew this was a major expedition unseen in the sect for a century, and it concerned the foundation of the Divine Thunder Zhenjun's prestige within the sect.

This was Xu Yunfan's first battle after proving the Dao and attaining the Zhenjun position. He naturally needed to make a name for himself.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over the crowd below, finally fixing on a black-robed elder whose aura was as deep and stable as an abyss.

"Lu Chuan."

Daoist Lu Chuan, originally an old subordinate of Qingyuan Zhenjun, was at the peak of Foundation Establishment. However, after Xu Yunfan proved the Dao and became a Zhenjun, he had unhesitatingly pledged his allegiance. Xu Yunfan naturally accepted him without hesitation; he was currently short on high-end combat power.

Lu Chuan stepped forward, his expression respectful.

"Please instruct, Zhenjun."

"You shall temporarily take the vanguard position, commanding the first batch of three thousand disciples and thirty Foundation Establishment cultivators. Enter the Atila World first via the Void-Piercing Ships and establish an advance fortress in the Western Wilds."

Xu Yunfan flicked a purple-gold light talisman from his fingertip, which merged into Lu Chuan's brow.

"This is the map of the Western Wilds and the contact token for Zhang Ziyang. Upon arrival, follow his commands in all actions. Cooperate in constructing the Guidance Array to pave the way for the subsequent arrival of the main army."

"Respectfully obey the Zhenjun's decree!"

Lu Chuan solemnly accepted the order, his eyes flashing with brilliance.

This was an excellent opportunity to establish merit. If he performed well and gained Xu Yunfan's genuine recognition and trust, there might be a chance to become a Zhenjun in the future.

It had to be said that Xu Yunfan's attainment of the Zhenjun position was truly too exaggerated. Targeted by three sects' Zhenjuns, and even attacked personally, he had managed to have his clone prove the Dao to divert the firepower. At the most critical moment, he self-destructed his clone to finally achieve his Great Dao.

The process was arduous and extraordinary; the tribulation of human calamities was truly monstrous, to the point where the terrifying heavenly tribulation was selectively forgotten.

Or rather, in Xu Yunfan's view, with the Attribute Panel assisting, he could have smoothly attained the Golden Core.

But the human calamity was unavoidable. Rather than that, it was better to go with the flow and face the tribulation of the position.

The entire Taihua Spirit Ruins World saw it clearly: without protection, it was difficult for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to enter the Golden Core realm.

After arranging the matters, Xu Yunfan dismissed everyone and sat alone in the hall.

His divine sense sank into his dantian. The purple-gold Golden Core slowly rotated. At its core was a speck of red fire light, the manifested Blazing Sun Dao Fruit. Now, it was intertwined with the purple-gold thunder, emitting an even more explosive aura of destruction.

After returning to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, the Light-Consuming Blazing Sun Dao Fruit had reconnected with the Heavenly Dao. Now that it was under his strong control, it was naturally somewhat restless.

However, it was still within the controllable range. It would just take some effort to refine it and pull it into his own inner world.

On the Attribute Panel, the Cultivation Base column had quietly jumped to 1258 (Peak Early Golden Core).

A Cultivation Base over 1000 meant one was a Golden Core Zhenjun. So, how much is needed for the mid Golden Core?

Although the Cultivation Base indicator of 1258 on the Attribute Panel had already touched the peak of the Golden Core, without refining the Blazing Sun Dao Fruit, once the refinement is complete, it's unknown how much it will increase.

"Holding up the inner world, hanging high and falling forever..." he muttered to himself, the scene described by Dongming Zhenjun appearing before his eyes.

To peel one's own Divine Thunder Inner World prototype from the dantian, hang it high above the Great Void, form its own cycle, and be immortal and unfalling.

This was the key step to truly break free from the shackles of this world's Heavenly Dao and achieve an alternative form of long life.

And the origin of the Atila World, as well as the impending war between the two sects, were the perfect hunting grounds for him to gather resources and impact the mid stage.

The origin of the Atila Great World was of high enough status; the world origin extracted from it was perfectly suited for him.

Half a month later, at the Primordial Origin Sect's World-Breaking Platform.

Xu Yunfan stood at the center of the hundred-zhang high platform made of black jade. His purple-gold Dao robe stirred without wind.

After glancing at the dense array of Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment cultivators assembled below, his divine sense sank into his dantian.

The vast spiritual power of the peak early Golden Core erupted violently.

Ninety-nine purple-gold thunder dragons shot up from the crown of his head, their roars shattering the clouds for a thousand miles.

This was the Golden Core True Method, evolved from the Thunder Dragon Shattering Void technique of the "Divine Thunder Nine Chen Xuanqiong Immortal Indestructible True Sutra."

The scales and claws of the thunder dragons were entwined with the power of Blazing Sun True Fire. Wherever they passed, the chaotic void light of the sea of worlds melted away like snow and ice. The destructive true intent they contained was nearly tangible.

"Open."

Xu Yunfan formed a sword with his fingers, the light of the Seal character's mystery coiling around his fingertips, guiding with precision.

The thunder dragons charged ferociously into the void. The shattering thunder radiating from their bodies forcibly bored a stable channel across the sea of worlds.

At the end of the channel, the barrier of the Atila World trembled violently, revealing the phantom of scorched earth and shattered temples.

It was the Western Wilds, where the Heavenly Dao had been severely wounded after the fall of the three main gods.
