# Chapter 343: Li Mo's Full Recovery and Viewing the Rankings at the City Gate

Southern Frontier, Qingmu City.

It was a beautiful, sunny day. The lingering snow that had yet to melt sparkled brightly under the sun's rays. However, not a single speck of snow remained on the eaves of the Jiawei Restaurant, as if it had melted away long ago.

Perhaps it was due to the mysterious fluctuations that occasionally emanated from a certain private room.

The "Wife-Doting Battle Spirit" was still unaware that he had lost another one of his praiseworthy titles, moving him further away from his dream of becoming a Sword Immortal.

He was currently dual-cultivating.

Under the harmonization of Yin and Yang, the efficacy of *Phoenix's Cry in the Heavenly Marsh* had improved by more than ten percent. His injuries were almost completely healed.

He would be ready today to set off and gather the Power of All Living Beings.

Little Li was fully prepared!

"Li Mo, why do you keep... looking at me?"

"Oh, this is also one of my preparations."

"?"

"Your cold expression helps the onlookers think I'm profound and unfathomable, not an ordinary person."

Li Mo had already mastered seven-tenths of the Ice Cube's cold expression!

He had worked hard for this, studying her face during their dual-cultivation sessions!

The remaining three-tenths were mainly because he couldn't replicate it on his face. The faint blush on her neck, he could never learn, and probably wouldn't need to...

As he spoke, Li Mo put on an expression of noble aloofness, deep and quiet.

It was the Ice Cube's cold expression—the Little Li version.

"Looks similar, right? Don't you think I suddenly have an aura of a god?"

"..."

Ying Bing's beautiful eyes lost focus for a moment before she silently pulled her hand back and said softly, "It's time to go. Elder Shang and the others should be waiting downstairs. Remember to take off your clothes."

"Take off my clothes?"

"The training attire. You can only wear it when training."

"But this is my best-looking outfit."

Li Mo touched the golden-threaded sun on his clothes, reluctant to part with them. He didn't have many well-fitting clothes. Some were standard issue from the Qingyuan Sect, one was sewn by his mother, and another was made by Princess Jiang. But those clothes didn't suit his current demeanor.

Since this was for acting—ahem, gathering the Power of All Living Beings—not only did his acting need to be in place, but the costumes and props had to be perfect too.

That's right. Our Best Actor award winner doesn't just rely on his looks; he is very professional.

The key point was that this was the same set as what the Ice Cube was wearing. Thinking of this, he felt immensely proud.

"Then you can wear it."

Ying Bing tied up her black hair, knowing that if Li Mo wanted to wear it, he would just change into it secretly once they went out. She subconsciously reached out to smooth the wrinkles on his collar.

"But you'd better come back early, or you'll face the consequences."

"Huh?"

Li Mo was confused. What consequences could there be from just a piece of clothing? He didn't quite understand.

The two went downstairs together to the restaurant's main hall. The place was bustling with martial artists who were excellent at practicing Form-Combination Martial Arts. But it was no big deal; Li Mo was also "a little" knowledgeable in this area and could blend in perfectly.

"This outfit..."

Wu Qing looked at the two coming down the stairs, like a golden boy and a jade girl. She raised an eyebrow, thinking she might as well have a matching set custom-made for Feng. She asked, "Little Mo, where did you order these matching couple's outfits?"

"Hm?"

Shang Qinqing immediately perked up and,不知从哪里, pulled out a handful of melon seeds.

"Tsk, no wonder you didn't want the phoenix crown and wedding robes of the former empress. It turns out you have something more suitable. One sun and one moon, quite thoughtful."

Li Mo glanced at the Ice Cube and cleared his throat. "This is training attire, and also my performance costume."

Wu Qing: "?"

Is this how the younger generation dates these days?

Ying Bing lowered her eyes, looking serious and calm. "Yes, it works better for training."

---

"What kind of training?"

Shang Qinqing, worthy of being the god of love in the Great Shang Dynasty, once again keenly spotted the key point.

"Dual..."

Li Mo had just opened his mouth when he suddenly felt a familiar sensation on the back of his foot—the Ice Cube had gently stepped on him.

Ying Bing said with a straight face, "Elder Shang, haven't you eaten yet? I'll go to the kitchen and make you a few dishes."

"I know you're trying to shut me up, but..."

Shang Qinqing curled his lips. "Is it actually... to silence me permanently?"

Seeing that the Ice Cube really seemed to be heading for the kitchen, Shang Qinqing stopped talking and called for the martial artists skilled in Form-Combination Martial Arts to set off.

As Li Mo walked out of the restaurant, he inexplicably turned back. He didn't know why he did it; it was just a subconscious action.

He then saw a figure in a dark-colored immortal dress standing on the second-floor windowsill, looking right at him.

Their eyes met.

Li Mo smiled and waved. Ying Bing nodded, then casually looked at the scenery elsewhere. However, one could feel that her lingering gaze remained.

"I'll be back early."

After saying this, Li Mo and the other demons left the city.

Since they were still within the city, it wasn't convenient for them to use their bloodline powers, so they walked on foot towards the city gate.

Along the way, the scene in Qingmu City was peaceful and serene. If one ignored the scars on the city walls, the tranquility here made it hard to believe that not long ago, Qingmu City was on the brink of destruction.

"It's really nice."

A sense of peace rose in Little Li's heart. He didn't know if it was a sense of achievement, but he was just very happy.

Not long after, they were almost at the city gate. It was swarming with people, just like when Li Mo and Ying Bing had first arrived in Qingmu City.

"The Prodigy Rankings are being posted again?"

Li Mo found it familiar yet strange. Qingmu City was on the farthest border of the Great Yu Dynasty, and there was no Dragon Gate here. How did the news travel so fast?

Shang Qinqing smiled without saying a word.

Suddenly, a wave of exclamations came from the crowd.

"The rankings are out!"

"Is Young Hero Li on it? I came specifically to see him."

"Tsk, tsk, looking through the entire Prodigy Rankings, there isn't a single young hero with the qualification of a 'ten-thousand-enemy champion.' Young Hero Li's deeds are comparable to the ancient Hegemon!"

"Our Qingmu City has also gained some fame, able to make a name for ourselves in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands."

The scene was incredibly lively. The onlookers were all focused, crowding in circles within circles. Even the children on their way to school had stopped to watch.

Young Hero Li himself couldn't see the actual list at all; he could only listen from the outside.

"It's out!"

"Fourth place, Young Hero Li is fourth!"

The common folk clamored.

"Senior Guo, has my nickname changed?"

Li Mo asked the question he was most concerned about.

Guo Chuan was an elder of the Leviathan Clan, tall with a good view.

At this moment, his expression was a bit strange. "It has changed."

"Both yours and Miss Ying's have changed."

"What are they?"

Wu Qing was also curious. She had yearned to roam the Jianghu and leave behind a famous reputation back in her day, but unfortunately, she got married and had children halfway through.

"Miss Ying's 'Moon Sword Phoenix' is gone. It's changed to 'Goddess of Mount Gu.'"

"And me?"

"'Solitary Marvelous Sword' is gone."

"?"

"It's become 'Little Tyrant with a Divine Hammer.'"

"???"

Li Mo's vision went black.

...

PS: The nicknames have been slightly changed, but they're still quite fitting, hehe.

Please support me with power stones, mwah.
