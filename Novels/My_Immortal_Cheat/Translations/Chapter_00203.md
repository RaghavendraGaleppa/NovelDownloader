## Chapter 203: The Remnants Arrive

“Very well.”

Master Puzhi nodded, extending a finger to tap the void. A ripple of golden light emerged, and then a scene materialized before everyone: the area in front of the ancient city gates.

The Four Dragons of Tianyan floated in the air, each with a banner above their heads, forming a grand formation where earth, wind, water, and fire cycled ceaselessly.

But at this moment, their faces were pale, their bodies trembled, and blood seeped from the corners of their mouths. Their expressions were grave, even fearful, as they gazed at the other side.

On the other side, a disheveled creature stood in the void, its face unclear, occasionally emitting “heh-heh” sounds. Its body was shriveled, shrouded in black mist.

“A Remnant!” Zhou Tian exclaimed in surprise. They had just been discussing them, and now one had appeared directly before them so quickly.

“Can we destroy this Remnant directly if we all attack together?” Huang Qi asked. This was a great opportunity. The Remnant had not yet entered the city and could not contact the sea of blood. If they could destroy one now, it would significantly reduce their pressure.

“Don’t rush,” Puzhi stopped him, gesturing towards the projection.

Huang Qi’s pupils contracted because another disheveled figure arrived from afar, carrying a gigantic corpse in its hand. It was the Arm-Reaching Golden Ape, its body now shriveled and its fur withered, almost all its vitality absorbed. Even after absorbing such immense vitality, the disheveled humanoid skin had only gained a hint of color, showing how terrifying it was.

Another Remnant. Two Remnants had now appeared before anyone could speak. From another direction, the last Remnant arrived, still chewing on something. Faintly, golden talisman paper was revealed.

In a moment, all three Remnants had arrived.

“They are not mindless beasts,” Puzhi sighed, clearly indicating that they also didn’t want to be defeated individually and had come here together.

Then, the three Remnants attacked instantly. In an instant, the grand formation formed by the Four Dragons of Tianyan shattered. Three of the individuals’ bodies directly turned into desiccated corpses, leaving only one who hadn't even had time to react. However, the three Remnants temporarily held back from attacking that person. They surrounded the individual in a triangular formation, occasionally emitting strange sounds, seemingly communicating. Finally, they attacked together, and the remaining person was split into three, dismembered. It seemed they had just been discussing how to divide this last person.

Huang Qi fell silent, no longer speaking. All three Remnants were at the Dao Lord peak realm, no longer something that could be easily slain.

“However, a clean sweep like this is also good,” Puzhi spoke again, drawing everyone's attention. Huang Qi’s expression was even stranger. *Master, who was it just now who stopped me from going? And now you want a clean sweep?*

“When I was fourteen, I became my master’s disciple. I once saw Master suppress the entire Buddhist realm alone. When Master passed away, I was also by his side. Master told me to leave, but I defied his wishes. My life is not solely for cultivation and seeking the Dao. Master passed his mantle to me, and there are some things I must do. My only regret is that in the end, I could not reach the Heavenly Venerate realm!!!”

Puzhi sat cross-legged in the void, murmuring, seemingly speaking to Zhou Tian and the two others, yet also as if speaking to himself. His body glowed, began to turn ethereal, and emitted golden light.

“I will place my remnant body in the deepest part of the Buddha Nation, using forbidden arts to merge with Master’s entire remaining Buddha Nation, so as to attain Heavenly Venerate battle power for a period, and grant Master peace.”

Puzhi’s body completely vanished, leaving only a sound:

“Wu Tian, my Master.”

Boom!

A colossal sound echoed from the sky, and Buddha light shone universally. Zhou Tian looked up, dumbfounded, to see a vast space appear above the ancient city. Buddha light illuminated it, and the sound of scriptures being chanted was endless. It was precisely the Buddha Nation held by the colossal Buddha phantom, now manifested.

Buddhist chants echoed in their ears, and the phantoms of Bodhisattvas and Arhats flickered continuously. The Buddha Nation was contracting, and at the same time, the sound of a heartbeat reverberated throughout heaven and earth, as if the Great Dao itself was throbbing.

Thump!
Thump!

At the center of the Buddha Nation, there seemed to be a black hole, continuously condensing and collapsing, as ultimate Buddha light gathered. Perhaps it was an illusion, but Zhou Tian felt as if the entire world was trembling.

Bang!

The Buddha Nation had condensed into a mass of golden substance, and the powerful sound of a heartbeat resounded like a clap of thunder.

Boom!

Lightning truly appeared; this was the evolution of Dao principles. From within the golden substance, a pair of golden eyes seemed to open, and then the golden substance completely exploded.

A figure emerged between heaven and earth, appearing as a youth with red lips and white teeth, a black shawl, brilliant eyes, and a white robe.

“Wasn’t he an old monk?” Zhou Tian was stunned. How did he turn into a young, handsome man?

“The image of the old monk was merely for greater persuasion. I am not a disciple of Master’s Buddhist nature.” A voice echoed throughout heaven and earth, clear and resonant, carrying the hum of the Dao, shaking the world.

A vast aura circulated. Zhou Tian looked around to see the nearby Yin Soldiers all prostrate on the ground, black mist rising from their bodies, their bones turning as lustrous as jade.

“Is this a Heavenly Venerate?” Zhou Tian was somewhat dazed. This was the first time he had truly seen a physical Heavenly Venerate. A sense of reverence welled up within him, as if the very heavens and earth compelled him to worship, to give the life form before him due respect.

“Not entirely,” Huang Qi said, hearing Zhou Tian’s words. “He is still a bit short of a true Heavenly Venerate. His body has barely reached the Heavenly Venerate standard, but he is still a hair’s breadth away from that realm.”

“Still a hair’s breadth away?” Zhou Tian was very surprised. With such might, he wasn't yet a true Heavenly Venerate?

Boom!

Puzhi attacked, extending a hand as lustrous as jade. His fingers and palm were like a sword, slicing down vertically.

“Cycle of Life and Death!”

A greyish sword qi was unleashed, like a chasm in the sky. The very heavens seemed to be severed, carrying an endless aura of life and death, terrifying beyond measure.

The three Remnants trembled all over, sensing the danger. They were firmly locked on, with no way to evade, and could only brace themselves. Then they let out an unidentifiable roar, and the three Remnants slowly merged together, their bodies wrapped in black light, faintly becoming a true humanoid form.

Tear!

The sword qi cleaved into the black light, immense fluctuations spread, Dao symbols erupted, sword light surged, and the black light was torn open. The sword qi slashed onto the humanoid skin, opening a gash, but it also blocked the attack. In an instant, the three Remnants separated again, heading in three different directions towards the ancient city. Clearly, their recent merger was also a forbidden technique; they could not maintain it for long. They needed the augmentation of vitality to return to the Heavenly Venerate realm before they could truly contend.

In the central plaza, the Burial Tome trembled, seemingly sensing the nearby Remnants. The blood river surged and roiled, and the black stone tablet flickered erratically, its patterns almost completely eroded.

Boom!

The blood river was steaming, and wisps of highly condensed blood essence flowed into the Burial Tome, seemingly brewing some forbidden art.
