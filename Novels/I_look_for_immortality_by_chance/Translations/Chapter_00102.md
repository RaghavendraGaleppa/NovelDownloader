# Chapter 102: Crimson Cloud Fire Crow  

"Senior Brother, what exactly do you do for a living?"  

"Luoxia Sect is a Dao Embryo sect, no less formidable than our Qingfeng Dao Academy. Couldn't you just foster good relations with them?"  

"Do you really have to resort to killing all the time?"  

Bian Chuyao said helplessly.  

Though she spoke these words, the tension in her heart dissipated, replaced instead by a strange sense of reassurance.  

This villain might be ruthless, but his strength was undeniable—there shouldn't be any mistakes.  

"Stealing the opportunity to reach Foundation Establishment is akin to severing one's path to the Dao. How can we possibly foster good relations after that?"  

Gu Yuan countered.  

He wasn't a bloodthirsty person, but having committed such an act, how could they still form amicable ties? It was better to resolve the matter cleanly and swiftly.  

"Though the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit is indeed invaluable, for a Core Formation disciple's direct descendant, it merely means expending more effort and waiting a few more years to achieve Foundation Establishment on their own. It hardly qualifies as severing their path to the Dao."  

"As long as they aren't truly wicked or narrow-minded individuals, Senior Brother should show mercy where possible..."  

Bian Chuyao advised softly.  

Gu Yuan nodded in understanding, while inwardly sighing in admiration. Truly, the disciples of Core Formation experts could endure the loss of such a treasure. If it were someone from a humble background like himself, it would undoubtedly lead to a fight to the death...  

At this thought, he recalled a warning from the Bandit's Manual:  

"In the shadows, ambush and slay cultivators. In the light, defeat prodigies in open combat. Balancing both darkness and light is the true path to supremacy!"  

It seemed today's confrontation in the valley was a battle of honor between two Core Formation descendants—no underhanded tactics involved. Lately, he had indeed been excessively bloodthirsty.  

With this realization, Gu Yuan exhaled deeply, dispersing the excess killing intent that had accumulated around him.  

Seeing this, Bian Chuyao nodded approvingly, a trace of relief flashing in her eyes.  

If he could take advice, this villain still had hope.  

"Senior Brother, don't be overconfident either. In recent years, Luoxia Sect has been constantly waging battles, tempering a large number of prodigious disciples. Among them are many formidable fighters—you might not necessarily win..."  

"But don't worry. As long as you can hold them off until I'm free, I can lend you a hand."  

At this, Bian Chuyao's expression softened slightly as she instructed Gu Yuan.  

"Junior Sister's reminder is well taken. I'll keep it in mind!"  

Gu Yuan nodded, appearing to take her words to heart.  

With that, the two of them fell silent and stepped into the cavern.  

Everything was just as it had been in the Crossing True Star Formation. But this time, with Bian Chuyao's assistance, they quickly overcame all obstacles.  

Soon, a vast valley unfolded before them.  

---  

Rich spiritual energy hung in the air like mist.  

The moment Gu Yuan and Bian Chuyao stepped into the valley, they felt a surge of energy, their mana resonating with joy.  

Looking up, they saw countless vibrant flowers in full bloom, towering ancient trees reaching for the sky, and winding vines weaving through the landscape, filling the place with vitality.  

Above the valley, the blazing sun cast its nourishing rays, harmonizing everything in sight.  

Yet, on either side of the valley, dark miasma coiled and howled like demonic dragons, forming a vast curtain threatening to swallow the valley whole.  

The entire valley seemed like the eye of a storm—calm at its center, but surrounded by terrifying demonic energy that threatened to drag one into the abyss.  

"The demonic miasma grows stronger by the day. Soon, even this last refuge, Yunlan Valley, won't be able to hold out."  

Bian Chuyao couldn't help but sigh at the sight.  

"Haha, Junior Sister Bian, why lament the past? Zhongshan Kingdom defied the Heavenly Palace's laws—this calamity is their just deserts."  

"If not for this, how could we have obtained this Flowing Flame Golden Fruit?"  

Just as Bian Chuyao finished speaking, two figures materialized from the void at the far end of the valley.  

The leader was a tall young man dressed in crimson robes embroidered with golden lightning patterns. His eyes were bright and confident, his features handsome, and his stride exuded an air of authority. The words just spoken had come from him.  

Behind him stood another young man in crimson robes, though his attire was paler and less vivid. His features were plain, his fingers thick and strong, but his eyes burned with determination, his lips pressed into a firm line.  

"Senior Brother Deng?"  

Recognizing the newcomer, Bian Chuyao smiled gently and bowed slightly in greeting.  

"Junior Sister Bian, you flatter me. I, Deng, have been sent by my master to claim the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit. If I offend in the process, I ask for your understanding."  

Senior Brother Deng returned the courtesy, then gestured to the young man behind him and introduced, "This is Yun Yiyuan, Junior Brother Yun. To retrieve the fruit, we must pass through the demon-infested ruins, so I've enlisted his aid."  

Bian Chuyao, in turn, pointed to Gu Yuan, her eyes carrying a hint of admiration as she said with a smile, "This is Senior Brother Gu Yuan. He is peerlessly talented and exceptionally skilled—he's here to protect me!"  

"Oh? So this is Senior Brother Gu?"  

Intrigued by Bian Chuyao's introduction, the two newcomers scrutinized Gu Yuan before bowing in greeting.  

Gu Yuan remained composed, returning their courtesy.  

A brief silence followed.  

Though their etiquette was impeccable, their gazes kept drifting toward the center of the valley, where a fiery red pool shimmered.  

There, a small tree—seemingly forged from metal—gleamed faintly. Beneath its trunk, a golden fruit swayed gently, exuding a peculiar fragrance.  

The Flowing Flame Golden Fruit—the ultimate goal of their journey.  

No matter how refined their manners, a battle was inevitable.  

"Senior Brother Gu, I've long heard of Qingfeng Dao Academy's unparalleled techniques. I humbly request your guidance!"  

After exchanging glances, Junior Brother Yun stepped forward and bowed to Gu Yuan.  

"After you."  

Gu Yuan flicked his sleeve in invitation.  

"My apologies!"  

Junior Brother Yun offered a final courtesy before his gaze sharpened, locking onto Gu Yuan.  

Golden flames seemed to ignite in his eyes as an invisible crimson crow, radiating scorching heat, surged toward Gu Yuan's consciousness—a common spiritual attack in cultivator duels.  

Victory in this exchange would increase one's chances of winning the battle by thirty percent.  

But Bian Chuyao merely shook her head with a smile.  

The Crimson Cloud Fire Crow was a formidable presence among upper-grade spiritual attacks, capable of overwhelming most cultivators. But this villain was no ordinary man...  

"Roar!"  

An intangible roar echoed through the void. Before the Crimson Cloud Fire Crow's searing heat could scorch Gu Yuan's consciousness, it was extinguished by an icy aura.  

A silver-scaled dragon, its crystalline armor gleaming, lunged forward with claws bared, tearing into the Crimson Cloud Fire Crow.  

Junior Brother Yun's face paled instantly.  

"Top-grade spiritual sense!"  

Senior Brother Deng was equally stunned. He turned to Bian Chuyao and asked,  

"Junior Sister Bian, did you invite a Core Formation disciple's descendant? Which True Diagram does he cultivate? Aren't you afraid he'll steal your spiritual energy and seize your inheritance?"  

Bian Chuyao merely tilted her head and smiled. "Senior Brother Deng, who said only Core Formation descendants can possess top-grade spiritual sense?"  

Senior Brother Deng's expression stiffened.  

"Senior Brother, don't panic. Top-grade spiritual sense isn't invincible!"  

At that moment, Junior Brother Yun spoke up again.  

A golden light flickered in his eyes, and the Crimson Cloud Fire Crow—previously being savaged by the silver dragon—suddenly expanded. Its tail shimmered with iridescent hues as golden flames blazed like a miniature sun, resisting the dragon's onslaught.  

Seeing this, Senior Brother Deng exhaled in relief.  

His expression hardened as he turned to Bian Chuyao, wasting no further time.  

"Then I, too, shall test Junior Sister's skills!"
