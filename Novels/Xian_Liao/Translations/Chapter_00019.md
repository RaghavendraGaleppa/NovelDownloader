# Chapter 19: The Human Heart

Hu the Butcher stood up abruptly, his eyes flickering toward the cleaver by his side as he grinned. "Young Master Zhou, I won't lie to you—I've been waiting for you to come talk to me about this. I just didn't expect it to happen so soon."

His smiling eyes carried a natural ferocity.

In these times, one couldn't prosper without taking risks. The real fear was taking those risks and ending up with nothing. Zhou Qing, however, was his guarantee that his efforts wouldn't be in vain.

Zhou Qing understood men like Hu the Butcher well. As long as he could help him rise above his station, Hu would revere him like a god in the future. Men like Hu, struggling at the bottom of society, lacked only one thing compared to the big butchers—an opportunity.

An opportunity brought by a benefactor.

Clearly, Hu had long regarded Zhou Qing as a potential patron. He just hadn't expected Zhou Qing to offer him a chance so soon.

Hu was no longer young, and opportunities were best when they came early.

Zhou Qing then explained the matter of the Five Fragrance Pills.

Hu laughed heartily. "Young Master Zhou, I thought at first this would be some life-or-death matter. This? I can handle it for you."

Zhou Qing replied, "Brother Hu, friendship is one thing, but this is business. I'm asking you because I trust you can do it well. If it doesn't work out, I'll still remember your kindness, but I won't trouble you with future matters."

Hu said solemnly, "If I fail at this, I'd be too ashamed to face you again. I've been getting close to you precisely for an opportunity like this. If I can't deliver, I might as well give up my ambitions and settle for being a butcher. I only hope you won't think me unworthy."

Zhou Qing's expression turned serious. "Brother Hu, don't call yourself unworthy again. I came to you because I trust your character. If things go wrong, I won't blame you—it would mean I had no one else to turn to. But if this fails, I won't ask for your help again because future matters will only be harder. Why drag you into deeper waters? Still, I won't forget the favor you're doing me now."

Hu rubbed his hands together. "Young Master Zhou, I won't waste words. I'll stake my life on this. But I need to borrow something from you."

Zhou Qing nodded firmly. "If you need anything of mine to get this done, name it. Consider it yours—no need for 'borrowing.'"

Hu laughed loudly. "Young Master Zhou, I used to think you'd surely pass the imperial exams. Now I see—someone like you will have legends written about you someday. It's my honor to follow you."

He bowed deeply to Zhou Qing.

This bow was one he'd intended to give only after Zhou Qing passed the provincial exams.

But witnessing Zhou Qing's words and actions today stirred something in Hu's heart. If he waited until Zhou Qing became a provincial graduate, would there still be a place for a mere butcher like him?

True heroes were recognized in their humble beginnings. Only by attaching oneself to a rising phoenix could one soar to the heavens.

This was something the old scholar who'd taught him to read as a child had said. Decades later, the words still rang clear.

Zhou Qing helped Hu up. "Brother Hu, I'm honored by your faith in me. Regardless of how this turns out, I'll remember your kindness. Just tell me what you need—no need for formalities between us men."

Hu straightened up. "Young Master Zhou, I want your most prized essay."

Zhou Qing thought of his "Admonitions to My Son." "I have it. What do you plan to do with it?"

Hu explained, "I don't understand scholars' ways, but tell me this—can people immediately recognize your talent from that essay?"

Zhou Qing considered. In this world, there was no Zhuge Liang, and thus no "Admonitions to My Son." Moreover, his calligraphy was sincere and structurally impeccable—it could stand among famous works. He nodded. "Anyone literate would see it. You can judge for yourself when you see it."

Hu grinned. "If you say so, it must be true. With this cleaver and your essay, I'll go to the Lin residence and settle this for you."

Zhou Qing cautioned, "Brother Hu, don't act rashly. We're negotiating a partnership."

Hu laughed. "If I fail, I'll shave my head and become a monk, abandoning all ambitions."

Zhou Qing fell silent. He knew Hu was joking—but also declaring his determination.

At the Lin residence, after Hu's departure, Old Master Lin emerged from the inner chambers. "That ruffian made a scene, and you agreed to give him fifty-five percent? Forty would've been generous enough—we're providing distribution channels and materials. Even magistrates would be content with forty percent. Supporting him is one thing, but we shouldn't feed his greed. Besides, if he associates with such scoundrels, he's no ordinary scholar. The boy has steel in him. I fear we may suffer for it later."

Miss Lin replied, "Grandfather, after all these years learning from you, do you think I'd be intimidated by a mere butcher? I agreed after seeing an essay Hu brought—written by Zhou."

She paused solemnly. "Our family collects fine calligraphy, but I've never seen anything like this."

"What was special about it?"

"It had spirit. The content could become immortal."

"How do you know he wrote it?"

"The paper was mulberry bark paper bearing my mark—the same I'd given Zhou. The handwriting matched his."

Just then, a maid delivered a short lyric written on hemp paper.

Miss Lin read softly: "Last night, sparse rain, sudden wind..."

Compared to the "Admonitions," this lyric paled in depth and artistry, though the handwriting was identical.

There had been no drunken scholar selling calligraphy—it had been Zhou all along.

She imagined the youth, freshly orphaned and impoverished, writing such serene verses. Not for wine, surely. His refined breakfast manners suggested aristocratic upbringing before his fall.

Had Zhou not persevered, he might have become a beggar.

In those dire straits, he'd penned lyrics to fund his exams—hardships no outsider could fathom.

The thought brought her inexplicable sorrow.

Yet business demanded rationality. "Grandfather, with such talent, passing the provincial exams in two years wouldn't surprise me."

"Even as a provincial graduate, he'd be far from magistracy. Though certainly distinguished," Old Master Lin conceded. He recognized Zhou's promise but feared creating an insatiable official-to-be.

Miss Lin countered, "Grandfather, these are turbulent times. Zhou as a graduate would differ from others."

"How so?"

"He taught at Hu Village—a fact that drew Imperial Inspector Lu's attention."

"True, he has Lu's patronage."

Miss Lin shook her head. "If Zhou becomes a graduate, his greatest asset won't be Lu—it'll be Hu Village itself."

"Hu Village?"

Old Master Lin's expression darkened as realization struck.

Upon passing the exams, Zhou—with no local kin—would naturally attract Hu villagers to pledge lands and allegiance. Hu Village's notorious unity and ferocity were exemplified by today's butcher.

"Hu as in 'reckless,'" the butcher had dared say while gripping his cleaver.

Yet from a merchant's view, Zhou had chosen his envoy well. Such words would disgrace a scholar.

Moreover, Zhou as a graduate would command territory and manpower through his teaching ties to Hu Village.

The bond between teacher and student was unbreakable.

Zhou and Hu Village were natural allies.

With the Lin family's trade connections, they knew Hu Village was expanding. Should Zhou pass the exams in two years, he'd wield land, followers, and official status—enough to make even the prefect tread carefully.

If Zhou then reneged on their pill venture, the Lins would be powerless.

Ultimately, without male heirs, the Lins lacked loyal retainers willing to die for them.

Hence Miss Lin's concession of majority profits.

With over fifty percent, Zhou controlled the venture—nominally, at least.

Accounts could be manipulated, but nominal authority mattered.

Old Master Lin sighed. "You're right. I'm growing old and foolish."

Miss Lin said, "Zhou is extraordinary. We'll inevitably defer to him eventually. Better to yield now and earn his gratitude. The money means little to us, but buying favor from such a man later would be impossible."

The wealthy but non-aristocratic Lins were minor players. Old Master Lin mused, "Young talents often meet early ends. What if that day never comes?"

Miss Lin smiled. "Then we'd only lose some silver."

Nodding, Old Master Lin lamented his age. If only his granddaughter could master the supreme martial arts he'd brought from the monastery, their decline might be reversed.

Noticing her interest in Zhou, a conflicted thought emerged: Was lineage truly paramount?

Multiple children could carry the Lin name.

Yet...

Their paths diverged. In his remaining years, finding a formidable heir was the safest choice.

Otherwise, inviting a wolf into the house meant ruin.

Beneath the great mulberry tree in the courtyard, a cool breeze stirred.

Hu the Butcher was practically glowing.

For the first time, he'd single-handedly accomplished something grand. Sheepishly, he admitted, "Young Master Zhou, don't laugh—my legs gave out after leaving the Lin residence. I collapsed in the alley."

Zhou Qing smiled. "You did brilliantly, Brother Hu. I might not have done better."

Hu shook his head. "The Lins respect you. Without that, no amount of bluster would've worked."

Zhou Qing thought: They respect me, yes—but also Hu Village.

Not for its recklessness, but because Zhou's potential exam success would make him a local power broker with Hu Village's support.

Their alliance was mutually beneficial.

Assuming Zhou passed the exams.

Thus, the exams were imperative.

The empire wouldn't collapse within a year or two.

The fifty-five percent was nominal—accounts could be adjusted—but the concession showed Lin's regard.

The outcome sufficed.

Zhou expressed gratitude without elaboration. Some things were better left unsaid.

After seeing Hu off, Zhou rehung the "Admonitions" in his bedroom.

Then he gathered pebbles and practiced his projectile technique against the mulberry tree.

With "Black Tiger Steals the Heart" mastered, he focused on elevating "Flicking Finger Divine Skill" to proficiency.

Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!

Each flick sent pebbles flying with increasing precision.

The motions consumed little energy.

Lost in repetition, Zhou refined his art.

Suddenly, a pebble struck the trunk—and shattered.

Zhou blinked in surprise.

His technique had strengthened, but the tree's bark had hardened impossibly.

How else could it smash stone?

An eerie feeling arose.

Yet dwelling on strangeness bred superstition.

After months of peaceful coexistence, any supernatural aspect was benign.

Harder bark even benefited his training.

He could practice strikes against it.

Perhaps merging Tiger Play with Black Tiger Steals the Heart into a deadlier technique.

The tree made an ideal target.

Wooden dummies tested form; the mulberry tested power.

Zhou checked his mental interface:

Five Animals Play (Basic): Tiger (Proficient), Deer (Skilled), Bear (Basic), Bird (Basic), Monkey (Basic)

Martial Techniques: Black Tiger Steals the Heart (Proficient); Flicking Finger Divine Skill (Skilled).

Literary Spirit (Initial Stage).

Remaining Lifespan (35 years).

His projectile skill had indeed advanced. Soon, it might reach proficiency—another survival tool.

"Next, I'll commission iron pellets from Blacksmith Hu and attempt those restorative pills from my past life."

Iron pellets would enhance his projectile attacks beyond pebbles.

As for the restorative pills...
