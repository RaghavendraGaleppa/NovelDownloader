# Chapter 152: The Immortal Ascension of Ying Bing!

In the dead of night, Li Mo sat before the Hall of Divine Craftsman, holding two scrolls in his hands.

After applying the Creation Seal, the original "Mona Ice Smoothie" had not vanished. With the two paintings placed together, Little Li felt a bit puzzled.

"Both are Medium Form, so why can I observe one but not the other?"

"Does it have nothing to do with the grade of the painting?"

Sitting in the corner of the Heavenly Court simulated by his own powers, Little Li fell into deep thought.

The only distinction he could think of was that the portrait of the Ice Cube was painted by his own hand.

Could it be that only the ones he paints himself are observable?

Just as he was pondering this...

"Teacher... I... I'm here."

Jiang Chulong walked over with a light, pattering sound. Even through her blindfold, one could feel her joy. She seemed to want to get closer to share her happiness with her teacher, yet her steps were hesitant. She was a bit timid, afraid to stand too close to him.

"You're very punctual today."

Li Mo rolled up the scrolls and stood up. His gentle tone relaxed Jiang Chulong's tense body a little.

The尊(Master)'s little lesson began.

*Whoosh—*

Suddenly, Little Princess Jiang, who was listening to the lesson, paused slightly.

Li Mo was somewhat familiar with this fluctuation of aura. He activated his Providence Divine Eye to look, and indeed...

**[Name: Jiang Chulong]**
**[Age: 15]**
**[Constitution: Innate Sword Embryo, Wild Grass Sword Bone is currently forming.]**
**[Cultivation: Twelve Meridians of the Vital Energy Realm (Breaking through).]**
**[Providence: Gold]**
**[Evaluation: The youngest daughter of the Great Yu Emperor, born with a Sword Embryo body. At fourteen, her elder brother, the Crown Prince, stole her Sword Bone. However, the Sword Bone was born of her, yet she does not rely on the Sword Bone to succeed. If she can brush away the dust from her heart and complete herself, she can also become a Supreme of the Sword Path.]**
**[Recent Encounter: The Wild Grass Sword Scripture has just taken shape, about to be reborn after destruction.]**

Little Princess Jiang was about to break through.

In this world, there is no spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

Li Mo did not hesitate. With a thought, the rare treasures, spiritual materials, and two Profound Crystals piled in the corner were instantly shattered, transforming into the purest spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

The energy gathered towards Jiang Chulong.

Not long after...

**[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Jiang Chulong' and helping her break through.]**
**[Investment Feedback: Mithril Creation Seal!]**
**[Mithril Creation Seal]: "Can deduce Divine Observation Paintings. Can be used on High Form,最多(maximum) deducing it to Extreme Form."**

"Teacher... I... I broke through..."

Jiang Chulong's weak voice came over.

"Hm?"

Li Mo was stunned for a moment. Focusing his gaze, he seemed to have discovered something. The Little Princess's aura was much deeper than he had imagined.

Jiang Chulong lowered her head.

"It seems... it's not the Condensation Qi Realm."

Li Mo: "???"

This was his world, so he released his perception slightly.

Then he discovered that the Little Princess had actually liquefied her internal energy.

This speed was not slower than the Ice Cube's.

Theoretically speaking, apart from his own Immortal Body—which he still knew very little about—the Ice Cube's talent was the strongest he had ever seen.

But upon a little thought, it was understandable.

Little Princess Jiang's talent was also excellent, and she was known as the卷王(King of卷/Involution). Because once she reached the Internal Energy Realm, Big Brother Li would give her a gift.

So she practiced hard every moment of the day, even dreaming of cultivation.

Coupled with the "Master" feeding her, it was not surprising that she was reborn after destruction.

"Very good."

Master nodded and praised her casually.

Jiang Chulong stood obediently there, her small lips trembling.

Seeing her like this, Teacher Li Mo remembered the things he had promised her.

First, tell her stories about the Heavenly Court.
Second, bring Big Brother Li in to play.

"Let me tell you a story about the Heavenly Court today, how about that?"

Master cleared his throat and adopted a deep, bubbly voice.

"Mm..."

---

Jiang Chulong was a little disappointed, but she still sat obediently like a duck, looking forward to it.

She would tell the stories she heard here to Da Zhu and the others when she went back.

"Speaking of why the Eight Trigrams Furnace tipped over."

"We have to tell the story of a monkey born from a stone."

*Up the PPT!*

Once his painting standard rose, Little Li's composition skills also improved.

Plus, the World Seed could generate scenes according to his will.

The viewing experience was as if he were there.

"At that time, there was the Eastern Continent of Divine Power, and by the sea of the Aolai Kingdom, there was a Flower Fruit Mountain..."

*Whoosh—*

The wind and clouds changed, and a scene of a stone being weathered by wind and rain, absorbing the essence of the sun and moon, appeared before their eyes.

...

The next morning.

"The Little Princess seems to really like 'Journey to the West'."

Li Mo got out of bed leisurely.

In his hand, he held another small, silver-white seal.

"Ancient Bronze Creation Seal, Mithril Creation Seal, Gold-Edged Heavenly Book Seal..."

"I can now directly deduce a Medium Form into a Great Dao Divine Form?"

Li Mo pondered.

He took out the Four Treasures of the Study and took a deep breath.

Focusing his mind, he tried to find the feeling of drawing the Divine Observation Painting from yesterday.

In the end, a stone leaped onto the paper on the Green Vein Jade Paper.

"This is just a painting."

"It's not a Divine Observation Painting."

Li Mo shook his head.

He had just tried to draw the stone from which Brother Monkey was born.

But... he failed.

Now there were no other choices.

Li Mo took out the Ice Cube scroll that had been deduced to Medium Form.

First, the Ancient Bronze Creation Seal.

A brand new scroll was separated by a misty light.

**[Ancient Bronze Creation Seal used successfully.]**
**[This painting depicts Ying Bing during her Body Transformation breakthrough period.]**

Apparently, after being upgraded to High Form, thezen the的的 the的的 a a的 the的的的的 a的 a the的 a从的的的的的的的的的的从 a a从的的的从原本的的的从的的的的的从的的的的的的的的的的的的从的的的的的从的从的从从的的的的从从从从的的从从从从原本原本原本原本原本原本原本从原本原本从从原本原本原本销售销售原本原本原本原本原本销售销售原本原本原本原本原本原本原本原本的原本原本原本原本原本原本的 the, and the Ice Cube was not slow.

A brand new scroll was separated by a misty light.

**[Ancient Bronze Creation Seal used successfully.]**
**[This painting depicts Ying Bing during her Body Transformation breakthrough period.]**

Apparently, after being upgraded to High Form, the aura of this painting was even higher.

Its majesty was also more supreme.

Li Mo's spirit soul did not feel any discomfort.

"It can continue."

*Smack—*

The Mithril Heavenly Book Seal just刷(farmed) from Little Princess Jiang was stamped onto the newly appeared painting.

**[Mithril Creation Seal used successfully.]**
**[This painting depicts Ying Bing at the Tongtian Realm, ranking among the Nine Heavens.]**

At this time, the scene in the painting had changed to a magnificent jade palace.

The palace floated in the air, overlooking all living beings, and disdainfully looked down upon everything in the mortal world.

Its master was as cold as it was.

The Ice Cube in the painting, now dressed in a jade-colored rainbow dress, was supremely majestic. It gave people the illusion that she was stepping on the firmament, yet she had brought it to a new height.

If Ying Bing were here.

She would probably feel the illusion that she had not yet been reborn.

However, what she was doing in the painting was something she had never done.

She quietly observed the mortal world, watching the tides rise and fall, as if waiting for something.

"Continuing further, it will be the Great Dao Divine Form."

Li Mo looked at the painting, his heart and mind shaken.

But his spirit soul and his body did not feel any inability to bear it. He could still continue.

The Gold-Edged Heavenly Book Seal slowly pressed down on a corner of the scroll.

*Hum—*

Everything on the scroll began to blur, becoming unreal.

The notification sounded.

**[Gold-Edged Heavenly Book Seal used successfully.]**
**[This painting depicts Ying Bing's scene of Ascending to Immortality and Transforming into the Dao!]**

This.

Was the realm that Ying Bing had pursued her entire life, yet she herself had never reached!
