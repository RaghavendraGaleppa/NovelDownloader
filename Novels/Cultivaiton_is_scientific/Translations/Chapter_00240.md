# Chapter 240: Calling for Reinforcements

Li Shiming didn't immediately inspect the storage bracelet. His gaze fell upon the two third-grade Five Elements formation materials displayed in the hall.

His divine sense moved effortlessly through the formation as if it didn't exist. Wrapping around the two materials, they vanished into thin air—stored away in his spatial ring.

With their disappearance, the entire pavilion's formation stuttered. Outside, the market's protective array collapsed completely.

Market-goers looked up in unison. Foundation Establishment cultivators perceived it more clearly—the market's protective formation had vanished.

"The market's been breached! Run!" one cultivator shouted in realization.

Chaos erupted as more cultivators scattered in all directions. The once-orderly market descended into turmoil without its protective formation.

Many cultivators saw opportunity in the chaos. With the formation gone, they could leave from any direction—but not empty-handed. Looting became inevitable. Some snatched goods from stalls, sparking instant battles. Others eyed the pavilions, where higher-value treasures were stored.

Stall owners, sensing danger, quickly packed up and joined the looting frenzy. Initially, fear held them back—the Hang Clan had a Golden Core cultivator, after all. But when the first group stormed a shop without retaliation, restraint vanished.

As the chaos peaked, a terrifying pressure swept through the market. Every cultivator froze under the Golden Core cultivator's might.

"What happened? How dare you pillage my market!" Hang Jian roared upon seeing the devastation. As the Hang Clan's patriarch and only Golden Core cultivator, his divine sense swept over the crowd, instantly quelling the frenzy.

Under a Golden Core cultivator's absolute power, death could come in a breath.

Hang Jian suppressed his murderous rage. Acting rashly would destroy centuries of the Hang Clan's reputation, making future market operations impossible. The market was immensely profitable, facilitating high-value trades that benefited the clan greatly.

Scanning the main pavilion, he found Li Shiming packing loot—and his son Hang Yuqing's corpse.

Li Shiming couldn't resist—he'd discovered a spatial-array warehouse on the third floor filled with second-grade materials. Though individually modest, their collective value was substantial.

As he emptied it, a powerful divine sense brushed over him. His heart sank—the Hang Clan's Golden Core cultivator had returned.

"Damn it!" Realizing his predicament, he grabbed Ji Hongbo from the floor and sent multiple distress signals—through his sect identity jade and his North Shu Commerce guest alchemist token.

Within hundreds of miles, where spiritual veins converged and numerous mid-sized cultivation forces resided, three Golden Core cultivators received urgent messages from North Shu Commerce: Rescue guest alchemist Li Shiming at the specified location.

Li Shiming's reputation preceded him. While major sect disciples rarely bought pills externally, his name was legendary among smaller factions. His pills symbolized unparalleled quality—"Li Shiming's work guarantees excellence."

Without hesitation, the three Golden Core cultivators raced to the location.

Meanwhile, the Shu Mountain Sect received Li Shiming's distress signal. Sword cultivator Elder Zhao was first to respond, using sword遁 (dodge) to speed away. Elder Su interrupted his cultivation to follow, with Elder Ma close behind on a flying vessel.

Other Golden Core elders monitored the situation closely. For Li Shiming—still within sect territory—to call for help meant facing an insurmountable foe.

As the sect's prized alchemy prodigy, any threat to him was an affront to the Shu Mountain Sect's dignity. Had three elders not already responded, more would have mobilized.

Li Shiming now held formation flags, placing them strategically to reinforce the pavilion's defenses. Against a Golden Core cultivator, escape was impossible—but the pavilion, originally designed to withstand early Golden Core attacks, offered refuge.

Though removing the two third-grade materials had destabilized the formation, his near-Master-level skills and IBMz15's calculations allowed swift adjustments.

"Stay where you are! Move and die!" Hang Jian commanded the crowd before flying toward the main pavilion, intent on avenging his son.

Yet when he arrived, his divine sense couldn't penetrate. The reactivated formation blocked him.

Enraged, Hang Jian slashed with his sword. The pavilion shook but held firm. In that brief time, Li Shiming had not only activated but continuously reinforced the formation with additional flags, making it increasingly robust.

"Who are you? Why kill my son?" Hang Jian demanded after his failed attack, forcing calm.

"The Shu Mountain Sect's true disciple, Li Shiming!" Li Shiming replied loudly while working, hoping to buy time. The longer they talked, the stronger his defenses became.

He didn't know if North Shu Commerce's call had worked—his real hope lay in the sect elders' arrival time.

---

The announcement rippled through the market.

"It's Li Shiming!"

"Who's that?"

"The genius alchemist! Most of North Shu Commerce's premium pills this past year were his!"

Hang Jian's face darkened. He knew Li Shiming's reputation—his marked pills were auction-house exclusives. Why would such a figure rob his humble market?

The corpses and captured cultivator suggested deeper motives, but with his son dead, reason fled.

"Surrender, and I'll spare you—delivering you to the Shu Mountain Sect for justice," Hang Jian offered, echoing Li Shiming's earlier words to Ji Hongbo.

Li Shiming scoffed. "Justice? Your market conspired to murder patrons, and you dare speak of justice?" 

He grew more confident—with each passing moment, the formation could withstand at least half an hour of assault.

---

Suddenly, Hang Jian sensed three Golden Core cultivators approaching rapidly from different directions. He unleashed a furious sword strike at the formation—still ineffective.

"Stop, Brother Hang! Don't err further!" one newcomer shouted.

"East Garden's Fu Feng greets Daoist Li!"

"East Garden's Yi Yuan greets Daoist Li!"

"East Garden's Kong Yinghua greets Daoist Li!"

The three positioned themselves between Hang Jian and the pavilion, bowing respectfully.

"Thank you for your aid. I owe you this favor," Li Shiming replied, knowing exactly what they valued most.

The trio brightened. A favor from a future Alchemy Master was priceless—especially for rogue cultivators like them, who lacked sect resources for advancement.

"Brother Hang, we're acquainted, but this matter is non-negotiable. Attacking Daoist Li means opposing the Shu Mountain Sect—we won't collude in this," Fu Feng stated coldly.

The others remained silent, baffled by Hang Jian's stubbornness.

"Honored seniors, just protect me a while longer. My sect elders are en route," Li Shiming added.

Relieved, the three agreed readily—their task now simply required deterring Hang Jian until reinforcements arrived, an easy way to secure Li Shiming's gratitude.

Hang Jian seethed but was powerless against three peers. Yet abandoning his ancestral legacy was unthinkable. Stuck in limbo, he awaited the Shu Mountain Sect's judgment—whether to accept punishment for his son's crimes or demand justice if Li Shiming had acted unjustly.
