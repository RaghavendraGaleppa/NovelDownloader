# Chapter 30: The Empty Fort Strategy

In the courtyard, two voices wailed incessantly. Having a leg severed alive was unbearable for anyone.

Lin Shan watched them impassively. "Mr. Zhao thinks quite highly of me, sending a first-class martial artist to capture me."

The first-class expert on the ground gritted his teeth against the pain and looked up at the young man sitting on the steps. Under the moonlight, his fair complexion and snow-white robes gave him an ethereal appearance, as if he might ascend to the heavens at any moment.

Becoming a cultivator had clearly elevated his demeanor and charm significantly.

"Impressive!" The expert coughed bitterly. "The family head misjudged you. You've been lying in wait here for some time, haven't you? What kind of hidden weapon is this, so sharp?"

Under the moonlight, Lin Shan sat calmly with an inscrutable expression. "Guess."

"Guess my ass! Brother Zhao, this brat even anticipated our night raid! His cunning is monstrous—we can't let him live!" The other Zhao family retainer on the ground shouted at the first-class expert. "I'll fire the signal arrow to summon reinforcements. We must eliminate him tonight!"

He pulled a flare arrow from his robe, ready to launch it.

Lin Shan's heart skipped a beat.

After disabling these two, he hadn't moved to finish them off, not because he was being the stereotypical talkative villain or trying to show off, but because standing up would expose his weakness.

Having just reached the Qi Refining stage, the meager spiritual energy in his body was only enough for three wind blades. After that, his dantian was completely drained.

Without spiritual energy, he was no different from an ordinary person—utterly defenseless.

As for his previous martial arts skills? Useless. Once becoming a cultivator, the true qi in his dantian had been expelled. Spiritual energy was supreme now.

Without true qi, what kind of martial artist was he?

Cold sweat broke out on Lin Shan's back. If the Zhao family really had backup nearby, wouldn't he be sitting here waiting to die?

As the retainer was about to fire the signal arrow, Lin Shan couldn't stop him in time. But suddenly, a hand shot out and smashed the man's head like a watermelon.

Lin Shan gaped. The attacker was none other than the Zhao family's first-class expert.

"Fool!" the expert spat. "This kid has been sitting there motionless since we arrived. That means he's set up a deadly trap to kill more of our family's experts! Only a blockhead like you wouldn't realize that!"

With a sinister smile at Lin Shan, he added confidently, "I admit you're ruthless for your age, quite the talent! But the Zhao family has countless experts. Unless you plan to stay hidden here forever with your trap, you'll join me in death sooner or later!"

Having convinced himself he'd seen through Lin Shan's scheme, the expert snapped the signal arrow in half, denying Lin Shan any chance to lure more victims.

Knowing he'd bleed out soon with one leg gone, the expert chose to end his own life by rupturing his heart meridian.

...

Lin Shan sat dumbfounded on the steps.

"He thinks I anticipated their attack? Set up traps? Planned to ambush more people?"

The first-class expert's logic baffled him. But recalling the retainer's words about nearby reinforcements, his heart sank. Without spiritual energy, staying here made him easy prey.

Yet he didn't know where the backup was hiding. Fleeing might lead him straight into their arms. If he stayed, meditating to recover energy while the corpses served as deterrents, perhaps the Zhao family would hesitate to act rashly.

Relieved the expert had killed the retainer, buying him precious time, Lin Shan began quietly absorbing ambient spiritual energy.

...

About half an hour later, footsteps approached—four people this time.

"Why hasn't Second Brother reported back? Could something have happened?"

"Impossible! Few in Zangke City could challenge a first-class expert like him!"

"But I heard screams earlier—"

"Must've been from that kid. You know how brutal Second Brother can be."

"Maybe they're dividing spoils. That would explain the delay."

"Let's check."

...

Four pairs of hands gripped the wall. Lin Shan's eyelid twitched as anxiety gnawed at him.

"If only I'd had more time to cultivate! How could an immortal cultivator be reduced to this?"

Four heads peeked over the wall.

(⊙x⊙)×4

Lin Shan's back grew damp with sweat, but he remained motionless, pretending not to notice.

The newcomers spotted the two corpses and exchanged frightened glances, silently debating their next move.

Lin Shan sensed their hesitation through spiritual awareness. Suppressing the urge to flee, he focused on energy absorption.

"Almost... just a bit more..."

The four observers watched the composed young man meditating serenely in the moonlight, his pristine white robes giving him an almost transcendent aura.

They wondered what method he'd used to effortlessly kill a first-class expert. None dared be the first to enter.

When Lin Shan's lips curled slightly as his energy replenished, the four took it as mocking provocation—a trap waiting to spring.

...

Time crawled by.

After failing to identify any traps, the four decided to retreat and report to their family head. With lives at stake, none wanted to gamble.

As their footsteps faded, Lin Shan exhaled in relief.

Thankfully they hadn't possessed ranged weapons, or he might have become history's most pathetic deceased cultivator.

...

By the fourth watch (1-3 AM), Lin Shan had recovered one-third of his energy. With one wind blade in reserve, he felt marginally safer but continued meditating.

...

At the fifth watch (3-5 AM), about 70% restored.

...

By sunrise (7-9 AM), full recovery.

With three wind blades available, Lin Shan finally felt somewhat secure.

As vendors began setting up stalls outside, he reflected on the night's events. The Zhao family wouldn't take losing a first-class expert lightly.

Though possessing wind blades, his limited energy meant only three attacks. Storming the Zhao estate was impossible—after three strikes, he'd be helpless.

Yet staying here risked constant harassment, disrupting cultivation.

Lin Shan decided to relocate.

With visible cultivation progress, once he could cast wind blades freely, he'd return to make the Zhao family truly understand an immortal cultivator's power.

Packing lightly—just a thousand taels in banknotes, three Qi Refining manuals, Lei Zhenzi's jade pendant, and some clothes—he left the heavy golden bell behind. Carrying the three-thousand-tael antique would draw unwanted attention.

"Consider it the Zhao family storing it for me. They'll repay me with interest later."

...

Slipping away unnoticed using spiritual senses to evade watchers, Lin Shan bought a hat with veil, changed into coarse clothes, and rented a new courtyard through a broker.

He avoided returning to the Nightingale organization where Zhao family members worked as assassins.

Settled in, Lin Shan resolved: "Six months of undisturbed cultivation. Nothing will stop me."

As for the Zhao family, a cold smile played on his lips. "Dare oppose an immortal cultivator? Just wait."
