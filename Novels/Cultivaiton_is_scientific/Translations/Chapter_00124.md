# Chapter 124: Tracking

The two approaching cultivators were late-stage Qi Refinement practitioners from the Sacred Ice Sect. They cultivated the sect's primary technique, filling their bodies with icy spiritual energy, which appeared as deep blue in infrared mode.

Under the cover of night, the two late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators arrived at Eagle Beak Island with practiced ease. They had been the ones to carry out the previous assassination attempt, and now they had returned.

One of them took out a Formation-Breaking Talisman. As he channeled spiritual energy into it, the talisman emitted a beam of white light that flew into the small mountain-protecting formation.

"What's going on? Why didn't the talisman work?" he asked in confusion as the white light disappeared without effect.

He had no way of knowing that the defensive formation on Eagle Beak Island had been upgraded to a small mountain-protecting formation. Unless brute force was used, only a formation master far surpassing Li Shiming's skill level could possibly break through it in person.

Formation-Breaking Talismans were precious precisely because they allowed cultivators with no formation knowledge to potentially dismantle formations. However, they weren't omnipotent. These talismans were created by condensing the formation-breaking experiences of at least intermediate-level formation masters into spiritual materials.

While such talismans could instantly break lower-level formations, they were ineffective against higher-level ones like the small mountain-protecting formation. Of course, there were different grades of Formation-Breaking Talismans. One created by a grand formation master might still disrupt the small mountain-protecting formation enough to open a passage.

Clearly, the talisman these two cultivators used wasn't from a grand formation master. Such a valuable talisman wouldn't be wasted on a mere Qi Refinement cultivator—the cost would far outweigh the target's value.

"What should we do?" one asked his companion.

"Let's retreat. If the talisman doesn't work, should we try to force our way through?" the other replied, shaking his head helplessly.

Although they were only late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators and their spiritual energy fluctuations wouldn't be too noticeable, they were too close to the Nine Peaks. An attack could easily attract attention from Heavenly Sea Sect cultivators.

Without hesitation, the two decided to leave immediately since they couldn't accomplish their mission—this was the best choice.

Seeing the two figures preparing to depart, Li Shiming summoned his bronze corpse from the 'Netherworld Ghost Formation' and activated his wings to exit the island through the underwater passage.

In the past, he wouldn't have dared to track two late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators. But now, despite still being at the fourth level of Qi Refinement, his combat power was incomparable to before.

The bronze corpse had improved rapidly, now possessing combat power equivalent to the eighth level of Qi Refinement. The mid-grade Gatling-style magical artifact could unleash attacks at the seventh level, and with Li Shiming's spiritual sense enhancement, his 'Sword Control Art' combined with the Green Kite Wooden Sword could threaten late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.

His weakness was equally obvious—even with his 'Vajra Body Protection Divine Art', he couldn't withstand a single attack from a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator. Fortunately, his Spirit Turtle Shield compensated for this critical vulnerability.

Of course, all this was predicated on the two cultivators not being exceptionally strong. Through his spiritual sense, Li Shiming confirmed they were at the seventh and eighth levels of Qi Refinement.

The two moved swiftly, using a transparent flying boat as their magical artifact. Li Shiming's 'Black Sparrow Wings' allowed him to fly slightly faster, so he wasn't worried about losing them. To stay safe, he intentionally maintained a greater distance. Over the sea, he didn't need any additional tracking devices—IBMz15 could monitor their spiritual energy fluctuations through his spiritual sense and plot their trajectory.

After tracking them for three hours, dawn was approaching. Using his sect identity jade slip, Li Shiming determined they had traveled beyond the sect's thousand-li radius.

Just as he hesitated whether to continue, the two cultivators suddenly vanished. In the area where they disappeared, he spotted a small island—one of countless insignificant islands that rarely drew attention.

Li Shiming descended to the sea's surface, changed into a diving suit, and submerged. The water here wasn't deep, only about thirty meters. Moving along the seabed toward the island, he recalled his experience from Eagle Beak Island: approaching formations underwater reduced detection chances. That was why he had installed numerous monitoring probes underwater around his own island.

Extending his spiritual sense, he detected a formation on the island. As he suspected, it was an advanced formation that concealed spiritual energy fluctuations on the surface. However, direct contact with his spiritual sense revealed its presence.

IBMz15 mapped the formation's spiritual energy pathways and analyzed its operational patterns. 

Suddenly, a sense of foreboding struck him. He withdrew his spiritual sense and suppressed his own spiritual energy fluctuations.

A figure emerged from the island, completely unaware of Li Shiming's presence underwater, and flew away into the distance.

Li Shiming broke out in a cold sweat. He hadn't expected a Foundation Establishment cultivator to be on the island. Fortunately, the cultivator hadn't detected him—otherwise, he would have been in serious trouble.

The Foundation Establishment cultivator was Wei Yun, who had been waiting for the two Qi Refinement cultivators to report. When they failed and the Formation-Breaking Talisman proved ineffective, Wei Yun knew he had to inform his master. Although he might face punishment, hiding the failure would bring even greater consequences. As for the two Qi Refinement cultivators, their fate was now in their master's hands.

Li Shiming considered leaving but felt reluctant. His curiosity grew—which faction was targeting him? Was it the Profound Nether Sect? Had he been exposed to the Sacred Ice Sect? Or was it someone within his own sect who coveted his wealth, knowing he possessed substantial spirit stones?

The possibilities were numerous. He had killed Bai Li Jinyan, a genius of the Sacred Ice Sect, repelled Profound Nether Sect cultivators in South Mountain Country, and developed the 'Thousand-Mile Mutual Vision' within the Heavenly Sea Sect, amassing vast wealth. Any of these could have provoked retaliation. He needed to identify the specific faction targeting him.

Moreover, he noted that the island lacked a spiritual vein, making it unsuitable for late-stage Qi Refinement cultivation, let alone Foundation Establishment. The chances of another Foundation Establishment cultivator being present were slim.

Despite the island's sophisticated formation, IBMz15's analysis identified its operational patterns. Li Shiming's spiritual sense successfully infiltrated the formation, following a hidden passage into a cave dwelling.

Inside, the two cultivators sat cross-legged, their faces pale and silent, as if awaiting judgment. Indeed, they were—their unintentional deception of Elder Bai Li and their failed corrective action had sealed their fate.

Li Shiming confirmed their cultivation levels again: seventh and eighth levels of Qi Refinement. Sensing no other presence in the cave's additional chambers, he grew bolder. The rooms showed no signs of life—unless someone was using concealment techniques, his spiritual sense would have detected them.

This emboldened him to test whether the mid-grade Gatling, costing ten thousand spirit stones, could truly suppress late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators. These two were perfect test subjects. Additionally, his other plans required corpses of late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.

Without further hesitation, Li Shiming manipulated the formation's spiritual energy pathways, opening an entrance for himself.

The two cultivators were startled, assuming a Sacred Ice Sect member had arrived. They had no reason to be suspicious—the island's formation was specially set up by their sect as a long-term hideout. Only authorized personnel could control the formation.

Instead, they saw a bronze corpse holding a peculiar six-barreled mid-grade magical artifact.

"Enemy attack!" they shouted in unison.

Their teamwork was impeccable. The seventh-level cultivator activated a high-grade shield artifact, while the eighth-level cultivator summoned a transparent ice sword.

But the bronze corpse was faster. With a pull of the trigger, the Gatling unleashed a barrage of thirty ice crystal bullets per second, each strike equivalent to a seventh-level attack.

"Help me!" the seventh-level cultivator cried out as the relentless assault overwhelmed his shield. Even with his spiritual energy pouring into it, the shield couldn't sustain the barrage for more than a second.

The eighth-level cultivator abandoned his attack to assist. Without defense, they were doomed. His enhanced spiritual energy infusion temporarily stabilized the shield, but the Gatling's unyielding assault meant their spiritual energy would eventually deplete.

They assumed the bronze corpse couldn't maintain such attacks indefinitely. Little did they know, the true source of the onslaught was the unassuming mid-grade Gatling, not the corpse itself.

Li Shiming entered the cave, dissatisfied with the Gatling's performance. Perhaps it was because he was facing elite Sacred Ice Sect disciples—sect cultivators, especially battle-hardened elites, far surpassed rogue cultivators in combat prowess.

Recognizing Li Shiming immediately from his portrait, the two cultivators realized their predicament but had no energy to question him—they were fully occupied defending against the Gatling.

"Seems the firepower is still insufficient," Li Shiming muttered.

Though the Gatling suppressed them, the cultivators hadn't reached their limits yet.

Opening his mouth, Li Shiming activated 'Demonic Sound Lotus,' with IBMz15 emitting the 'Soul-Reaping Buddhist Chant.' Compared to its first use against the Han family's mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, this version was exponentially more powerful.

The chant's Buddhist aspect magnified divine majesty and compassion, while its demonic aspect amplified worldly corruption. The juxtaposition elevated both to their extremes.

The two cultivators' expressions fluctuated with the chant, teetering on the brink of mental control. Once ensnared, they'd lose focus on their shield, leaving them defenseless against the Gatling.

"Frost Calms the Mind!" the eighth-level cultivator roared, swallowing a pill from a jade vial. A surge of cold energy cleared his mind.

"I'll hold them off—kill him!" he transmitted to his companion.

The seventh-level cultivator understood this was their last chance. Eliminating Li Shiming would neutralize the bronze corpse and fulfill their mission for Elder Bai Li.

Li Shiming sighed inwardly. He and IBMz15 had spent considerable time merging the 'Demonic Sound Infusion' and 'Lotus Utterance' techniques into 'Demonic Sound Lotus,' expecting unparalleled power. Yet these two cultivators had humbled their expectations—though IBMz15, of course, had no face to lose.
