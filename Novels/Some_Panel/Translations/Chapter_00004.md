# Chapter 4: Myriad Treasure Pavilion, An Open Scheme

The Myriad Treasure Pavilion was built on a grand and magnificent scale. Glazed tiles and golden gates glittered radiantly; one look told him they had spirit stones. Many cultivators came and went through its doors. Such a large establishment must conduct its business fairly, otherwise it wouldn't attract so much foot traffic.

Yang Ji planned to first go inside and consult some common knowledge books to understand the basic situation of this world. After a brief contemplation, he walked in. Immediately, a slender, delicate, and beautiful young maiden, with a beaming smile, enthusiastically greeted him. As she politely led him into the pavilion, she said with a wide smile, "Young master, how may I help you? Our Myriad Treasure Pavilion has everything from pills, artifacts, talismans, spirit herbs, to various precious materials."

Yang Ji offered a slight smile as a reply, his gaze calmly sweeping across the main hall. The first-floor hall was bright and spacious, adorned with carved beams and painted pillars. Incense burners filled with fragrant smoke were placed in the corners. Various precious paintings and calligraphy hung on the walls, creating an elegant, dignified, comfortable, and serene environment – a stark contrast to the outwardly flashy, nouveau riche facade.

Many counters were set up in the hall, displaying numerous rare and precious items. Female attendants guided cultivators as they browsed and purchased. Yang Ji calmly surveyed the environment and layout, then turned to the maiden and asked, "Do you have common knowledge books here?"

"We do!"

"Take me to see them."

"Certainly, young master, this way please."

The maiden led Yang Ji to a counter at the very back of the main hall. An elderly man half-reclined in a large chair behind the counter. Dressed in luxurious robes, he was stout, with a handlebar mustache and small eyes, instantly bringing to mind the image of a cunning merchant from a television drama.

"Elder Jin, a guest wishes to consult common knowledge books!" the maiden respectfully said to the old man.

The robed elder was engrossed in a book titled *How to Become Wealthy Throughout the Eight Directions*, occasionally taking a small sip from the tea beside him, looking utterly relaxed and carefree.

"Hmm, go ahead and look!" he responded casually without moving his gaze.

Others stood while he reclined, served tea no less. Such an arrogant and peculiar setup immediately told Yang Ji that this elder's status was likely not low. Looking at the common knowledge books neatly arranged by category within the counter, he pondered, "Consulting books doesn't require spirit stones, does it?"

Upon hearing this, the word [Amused] instantly appeared above the maiden's head, but she maintained her composure, her voice as gentle as ever: "Young master, as long as you don't take the books away, there's no charge for consulting them." Finally, she didn't forget to add with a sweet, playful smile, "However, if you damage them, you'll have to pay for them, oh."

Yang Ji remained calm, but he couldn't help feeling a little awkward internally. If he had immense wealth, why would he be like a country bumpkin entering the city, carefully treading as if even sitting down would incur a fee? However, hearing that he could browse freely without charge, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

Hearing Yang Ji's words, the old man holding the book was also startled. He subtly lowered the book in front of him and gave Yang Ji a quick glance. Yang Ji quickly composed himself, picked out a geography book from the counter, and began to read it.

After half an incense stick's time, through reading and subtly questioning the maiden, Yang Ji learned that the boundless sea he had seen earlier was called the "Endless Sea." He was currently in the "Thousand Isles Sea Domain" east of the Endless Sea, and the island he was on was named South Wind Island.

In the Thousand Isles Sea Domain, there were many rogue cultivators, quite a few cultivation families, and also three major sects: the South Origin Sect, the Azure Ripple Sect, and the Evergreen Gate. The book also briefly introduced the benefits of joining a sect, such as monthly cultivation stipends, lectures by Nascent Soul True Monarchs, Foundation Establishment methods, Nine-pattern Golden Core cultivation techniques, advanced pills never sold externally by the sect, grand divine abilities, Dao Sect quotas, and so on.

Upon seeing this, Yang Ji's eyes lit up. There were sects after all! If one did not join a sect, where would one get advanced cultivation methods, cultivation resources, and secret divine abilities? Joining an established organization was the best choice. Yang Ji's heart surged with excitement.

But before he could be happy for long, his joy quickly dissipated. He discovered that the three major sects did not accept disciples with lower-grade bone roots. This was blatant discrimination, filling him with indignation. However, his expression suddenly shifted, and hope rekindled in his heart. He saw a term: Outer Affairs Disciple.

The only hope for those with lower-grade bone roots to join a sect was to become an Outer Affairs Disciple. But becoming an Outer Affairs Disciple was difficult; it required one's cultivation to reach Qi Condensation Level 10. Seeing this, Yang Ji couldn't help but inwardly curse. These sects clearly didn't want to cultivate lower-grade bone root disciples; they just wanted to pick up ready-made talents, only accepting those who had already proven capable.

However, once one passed the assessment, the sect would immediately bestow a Foundation Establishment method and provide a place for Foundation Establishment. If one successfully established their foundation, they would transform, becoming an Outer Affairs Elder, their status rising dramatically. Seeing this, Yang Ji finally felt a hint of solace. This was a victory for lower-grade bone roots.

However, what he saw next caused his emotions to fluctuate again. These three major sects recruited disciples during two time periods. Disciples with mid-grade bone root aptitude or above were recruited once every five years, while Outer Affairs Disciples were recruited once every fifty years. This was based on the difficulty of cultivation for lower-grade bone roots.

Forty years had already passed since the last recruitment of Outer Affairs Disciples, meaning that if he missed the opportunity in ten years, he would have to wait another fifty years. By then, he would be seventy-eight years old, and his lifespan limit would not be far off. If he couldn't obtain a Foundation Establishment method in the remaining time, he feared he would follow in his late master's footsteps. But how could he accept such a fate?

"Ten years! How many decades of one's prime does one have in life? I must go all out." Yang Ji's mind was made up; he had secretly decided.

He took a few deep breaths, quickly composed himself, and continued to browse the books. The last few pages of the book in his hand contained little information, speaking only of the Cultivation Continent, tens of millions of miles east of the Thousand Isles Sea Domain. There were numerous Daoist Sects there, Grand Ascension cultivators, and even Nine Tribulation Rogue Immortals who stood at the pinnacle of the entire cultivation world. Although the description was brief, the word "Immortal" alone in "Rogue Immortal" was enough to fill one with longing. Yang Ji's little heart couldn't help but pound wildly; wasn't immortality his ultimate pursuit?

...

After finishing one book, Yang Ji had gained a certain understanding of the world's geography and formed a clear plan in his mind. He put the book down and quickly began to browse other types of common knowledge books. He also saw an introduction to spirit stones, the circulating currency of the cultivation world. Top-grade spirit stones were extremely rare in the market because the spiritual energy they contained was exceptionally pure, making them invaluable for various purposes such as sect-guarding grand formations, breaking through with spirit-gathering formations, or rapidly recovering spiritual power during battles.

The commonly circulating spirit stones were low-grade, mid-grade, and high-grade. One high-grade spirit stone could be exchanged for one hundred mid-grade spirit stones, or ten thousand low-grade spirit stones. This was the theoretical exchange value, but practically no one would exchange higher grades for lower ones, as the spiritual energy purity of low-grade spirit stones was too low to make it worthwhile.

Afterward, Yang Ji flipped through several other books. He also gained a general understanding of the basic values of pills, spirit herbs, artifacts, and various materials. Additionally, he gained some knowledge about secret realms, islands, demonic beasts, and the Eighteen Dangers of the Endless Sea, among other things.

After all this reading, Yang Ji finally had a comprehensive basic understanding of the cultivation world. Just as he thanked the maiden and was about to leave, the robed elder smilingly called out to him, "Little friend, please wait a moment." He also motioned for the maiden to leave first.

Called by the elder, Yang Ji, like the maiden before him, addressed him: "Elder Jin!"

"Little friend, you must be new to venturing out, aren't you?" the elder said with a smile.

Yang Ji, feeling the elder's shrewd gaze, knew he couldn't deceive him, so he replied, "Yes, I've just come out from my family, preparing for some experience."

Instantly, subtle fluctuations in the old man's demeanor appeared above his head: [Family? Hmph, what kind of third-rate family doesn't even know this common knowledge? Just admit you're a rogue cultivator!]. Yet, on the surface, he smiled and said, "Oh, so it's a family disciple! My apologies, my apologies."

"Little friend, you've come out to gain experience, presumably to prove your capabilities. It so happens that our Myriad Treasure Pavilion's merchant ship will set sail in three days. If you're interested, how about serving as a guard on board?" The elder squinted and smiled. "As for remuneration, old man here senses you are at Qi Condensation Level 5. How does fifty spirit stones sound?"

The words [Black-hearted] instantly appeared above the elder's head. If Yang Ji hadn't consulted the books earlier, he truly would have been tricked. He calmly smiled and said, "Elder Jin, aren't fifty spirit stones a bit too little? Generally speaking, a sea voyage usually takes three to five days, and at least three hundred spirit stones would be the going rate."

"Little friend, isn't this your first time venturing out? You lack experience. Fifty spirit stones is already considering your decent cultivation." The elder smiled, and above his head appeared the words [You're already so poor, do you even have the right to haggle?].

Uh? Yang Ji was speechless for a moment. Being poor truly hit a sore spot. Seeing his silence, the words [Grasping] immediately appeared above the elder's head. He smiled and said, "Little friend, since it's your first time venturing out, accompanying our merchant ship will allow you to interact more with the other cultivators on board and gain some experience."

"You shouldn't rush into venturing out to sea on your own. Although the sunken treasures, spirit herbs, demonic beasts, and ores in our Thousand Isles Sea Domain are tempting, the waters here are very deep. I'm afraid you won't be able to handle it." The elder put on a facade of looking out for Yang Ji's best interests.

Through consulting the books, Yang Ji did indeed learn that cultivators in the Thousand Isles Sea Domain generally earned spirit stones by venturing out to sea. They sought delicious spirit fish, spirit herbs, ores, and other rare items from the ocean. Additionally, they could hunt demonic beasts at sea to obtain materials, demonic cores, and so on. But as the elder said, venturing out to sea carried risks, and for a cultivator like him who had never been to sea, risks were omnipresent.

Seeing Yang Ji's silence, the elder smiled, and the words [Open Scheme] appeared above his head. He said, "Fifty spirit stones, although a bit less, the experience you gain by accompanying our merchant ship is immeasurable."

The elder's words, like a coquettish young woman, truly grasped his heart. The experience was priceless, and it was precisely what Yang Ji currently lacked the most. The risks of this sea voyage were not great; it was mainly to prevent pirate robberies and to collectively activate formations to stabilize the ship during strong winds and waves.

As long as he agreed to accompany the ship now, he could earn his first pot of gold, which was always the hardest to earn. Yang Ji's heart was already won over, but on the surface, he calmly smiled and said, "Elder Jin, fifty spirit stones is still too little. I'll agree for one hundred spirit stones."

"Sigh, fifty spirit stones, no more. If you're unwilling, then just leave." The elder sighed and waved his hand.

Truly a cunning old fox, he hit my weak spot. Yang Ji was indignant, but for the sake of this first pot of gold, he gave in, calmly smiling, "Thank you for Elder Jin's high regard. Since Elder Jin sincerely invites me, then I shall accept."

This young fellow, he can put on a better act than me? The elder looked at him in surprise, then also smiled, "Good, very good! Then, in three days, arrive early, and we'll set sail."

"Thank you." Yang Ji cupped his hands in a bow, then turned around, shedding tears of unwillingness.

"Ah, it's too easy to manipulate a novice fresh out of the nest. And I saved over two hundred spirit stones. One step closer to becoming wealthy throughout the eight directions." The elder sighed, watching Yang Ji's retreating back, an expression of invincible loneliness on his face.
