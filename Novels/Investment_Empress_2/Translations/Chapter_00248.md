# Chapter 248: Preparations Before Departure, the Clerk Huang Donglai

In the backyard of the tavern.

"This is quite a奇妙 (marvelous) feeling using the Seventy-Two Transformations for the first time."

Li Mo stretched his arms and kicked his legs, his voice dropping an octave, sounding a bit like he was deliberately putting on a deep, bubbly tone.

He pulled out a bronze mirror and took a quick look.

His current face had grown dragon scales, and horns sprouted from his head.

He was clearly in the form of a transformed Ming Dragon.

Behind him, a faint shadow of a dragon loomed.

His thoughts shifted.

He suddenly felt his body stretch out, mist seemed to swirl around him, his hands turned into dragon claws, and the fluff by his lips became long whiskers. The transformation was swift; fortunately, Li Mo acted just as fast, hurriedly taking off the winter clothes made by Princess Jiang.

He had become a Ming Dragon four zhang long.

"My strength has increased... It seems I can also control water vapor..."

"Mommy! A monster!"

Murong Xiao's fingers trembled, his face filled with shock.

Li Mo: "......"

Bro, do you want to look in the mirror first?

"I understand, I understand." Murong Xiao pondered for a moment, his eyes filled with wisdom.

"Understand what?"

"That's why you could recognize me in the Spirit Blade Cave, because you and I are of the same kin!"

Murong Xiao stepped closer, clicking his tongue in amazement as he examined him.

Although he himself possessed the bloodline of the Ming Dragon, he couldn't fully transform into a dragon body. This was his first time seeing a true kin.

Look at these scales, these claws, these majestic dragon horns, this speechless gaze...

It's definitely him!

For a moment, Murong Xiao looked at Li Mo with an even more affectionate gaze.

"Brother Murong, I know you're excited, but could you please stop randomly touching me?"

Little Li Ming Dragon wanted to rub his forehead, but found his claws were too short to reach.

Speaking of which, although the number of claws differs between flood dragons and true dragons, their length seems roughly the same.

What do they do if their backs itch?

Li Mo intended to clear his throat, but instead let out a loud snort. "Let's get back to the point, Brother Murong. This is just a transformation technique of mine, not actual bloodline power."

Murong Xiao: "Huh?"

His brain was about to short-circuit.

A transformation technique could be more authentic than the real thing?

Watching the kind-hearted Brother Murong sink into deep thought, Li Mo breathed a sigh of relief.

As expected of a divine skill passed down by Brother Monkey; this transformation technique can't even be called a transformation anymore, it's indistinguishable from the real thing.

No wonder Princess Iron Fan could mistake her own husband...

With this, the trip to the Southern Frontier had become much more promising.

"It's time to set off..."

"Boss... Holy crap!"

Xiao Er Xu came to the backyard and immediately rolled his eyes, fainting on the spot.

Li Mo sighed, having no choice but to revert to his original form and release Moonlight.

Bathed in Moonlight, Xiao Er Xu slowly came to. He said with a face full of anxiety:

"Boss, I just saw a flood dragon that big."

"You must have had a nightmare."

"Is that so? I've never had a dream like that..."

"You forgot, you're a weirdo. It's normal to have strange dreams."

Li Mo patted his shoulder.

The clear moonlight shone.

"That makes sense..."

Xiao Er Xu calmed down and chose to believe his boss.

He also repeatedly promised the boss that during the boss's absence, he would definitely take good care of the tavern.

After all, the boss pays so well.

With good pay, and even the five social insurances and one housing fund, who would be bored enough to become an assassin?

"Boss, don't worry, the tavern is entrusted to me."

"Alright. If we're short on hands, go outside and recruit a few peers with management experience. I think the one selling sweet soups is pretty good. It counts as finding a new career."

"Okay! I'll make the tavern bigger and stronger, and create brilliance again!"

"Good, very spirited."

After交代 (交代) the matters of the tavern.

Li Mo walked up to Murong Xiao and patted him, rebooting his brain:

---

"Brother Murong, it's time for us to go."

"Oh, okay..."

Neither of them had much to pack; they didn't even need to take luggage.

Under Xiao Er Xu's waving farewell and the send-off by the reformed assassins from the entire street, the two walked out of Yulong Street.

On the road.

"Hmm... Brother Li, what kind of martial art is this exactly? It's so miraculous."

Murong Xiao had finally accepted the fact that Li Mo was not his kin, but he still couldn't help his curiosity.

Li Mo thought for a moment. "Aren't there quite a few martial arts that mimic birds and beasts?"

"Right, those types of martial arts are called Xiangxing (Mimetic) martial arts." Murong Xiao nodded.

He had also come into contact with them, like the White Crane Hanging Cloud Fist taught to him by Elder Han He.

"The more realistic the imitation, the greater the power?"

"Mm, that's the principle." Murong Xiao nodded.

"So, tell me, is mine realistic or not?"

"0.o"

Murong Xiao felt that Brother Li had a point.

But something seemed off.

After thinking about it, Murong Xiao decided to give up thinking.

He looked at the streets around him and realized this wasn't the road out of the city, but an even more bustling area than Yulong Street.

"Brother Li, aren't we going to the Southern Frontier?"

"We are, but the journey to the Southern Frontier is long. It's better to be prepared."

Li Mo looked towards the center of the street.

There stood a tall building that stood out from the rest, like gold-bricked tiles reflecting a treasure-like glow in the sun, dazzlingly bright. Its gold-plated plaque read:

【Hengtong Mercantile Exchange】

There were many precious items in the System Space, but they weren't all-encompassing; they couldn't compare to the variety of a proper mercantile exchange.

Moreover, the pills and spiritual treasures for tempering his physique were running low.

It was necessary to do some shopping first.

"Brother Li?"

As soon as they walked into the exchange, the clerk at the counter spoke up.

Li Mo looked over and saw a pale-faced, mustache-less, and somewhat timid middle-aged man. He didn't remember knowing this person, but his voice sounded somewhat familiar.

"Brother, you are..."

"It's me, Huang Donglai."

The middle-aged man adjusted the fake whiskers glued to his lip and said in a low voice.

"Brother Huang has quite a few identities..."

Li Mo couldn't help but laugh and asked:

"Last time I saw you, you were a herb gatherer. How did you become a clerk at Hengtong Mercantile Exchange?"

"It's mainly because my pockets are a bit empty..."

Huang Donglai smiled shyly. "The cost of living in Yunzhou is too high, and I also want to buy a batch of medicinal herbs needed for my cultivation."

"Hengtong Mercantile Exchange not only offers a considerable salary, but employees also get an internal discount... It's just that I often get scolded by the manager, but I can endure it."

Li Mo: "......"

No wonder he disguises his identity.

If he does a runner, Hengtong Mercantile Exchange won't even be able to find him.

"Brother Li, are you here to buy something? I'm very familiar with this."

"Yes, I'm planning to go to the Southern Frontier. I don't know what preparations I need to make."

Li Mo felt it was quite reliable to ask Huang Donglai about this.

As expected.

Huang Donglai smiled confidently:

"Brother Li, you've definitely asked the right person. My hometown is in the Southern Frontier."

"Brother Li, how much money do you plan to spend on various items? For a long journey, it's best to be fully prepared."

"I have a deposit receipt at Hengtong Mercantile Exchange. Let's spend all the money on it."

"Alright... Huh?!"

Huang Donglai nodded, but after taking the receipt, his body trembled.

Gasp...

Hengtong Mercantile Exchange clerks get commissions.

He might be able to do a runner early now.

As everyone knows, he is a very low-key person.

But right now, he kind of wants the manager to brew him a pot of tea.
