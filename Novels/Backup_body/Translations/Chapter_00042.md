# Chapter 42: The Living Immortal! The Master of Ancient Moon Peak!

"Capture three thousand alive!"

"Two thousand dead!"

"However, according to the records, you've only been an inner disciple for less than a month. You should be down-to-earth and not aim too high!"

The elder was furious. "Though I don't know why your name was included in this mission roster, you must know your limits! That master of the Gu arts even poisoned Senior Brother Gu..."

He slammed the table. "Someone capable of nurturing such high-grade Gu worms must have an equally formidable life-bound Gu. Do you really think you can handle him? Just last time, I saw another fool who had barely entered the sect and dared to hunt demons in Wanlin County of Qixing Prefecture. And now, not long after—damn it! Why is it you again?"

Li Zhengjing rubbed his nose and muttered, "Last time in Wanlin County, didn't I still capture that evil cultivator?"

The elder stood up angrily. "Last time, you were lucky! That evil cultivator was severely injured beforehand and lost an arm, leaving him with less than a tenth of his strength. Otherwise, with his upper-tier inner energy cultivation, he could have crushed you with one hand!"

"Do you think this time will be the same?"

"This man is a Gu King from the Southern Wasteland. Not only is his life-bound Gu lethally poisonous, but his own strength rivals that of an elder at the 'True Qi' realm!"

"Even if he's severely injured and weakened, a starved camel is still bigger than a horse. He's not someone you can mess with."

"Listen to this old man's advice: when you go down the mountain this time, don't think about capturing him alive. If you find any trace of him, stay far away, protect your own life, and report it immediately!"

"The sect sent you inner disciples down the mountain just to gather more eyes and ears to track this Gu King—not to have you confront him directly!"

"Remember, inner disciples go down the mountain for experience, not to throw their lives away!"

The elder sat back down, grumbling. "Evil cultivators of this level should be handled by the sect's elders! If not for this bastard committing such a heinous crime, we wouldn't even need to send inner disciples like you as scouts..."

"Understood, Elder!"

Li Zhengjing smiled. "Then this disciple takes his leave!"

"You brat, you just don’t know what’s good for you! Everything I said went in one ear and out the other!"

The elder waved his hand dismissively. "Get lost! There are others waiting outside. This old man has to deal with two to three hundred people a day—my backside is sore from sitting, and I’m swamped!"

Li Zhengjing bowed slightly, glanced at the golden token at the elder’s waist, and then turned to leave.

"Elder Jing Xiao, is it?"

Li Zhengjing mused to himself. "Though this elder seems gruff, he’s actually kind-hearted and well-meaning."

He had met this elder during his first visit to the Affairs Hall. The hall had twelve elders in total, and in subsequent visits, other elders had handled his affairs. 

Today was his second encounter with Elder Jing Xiao, and it left him with a favorable impression.

Meanwhile, atop Ancient Moon Peak.

A man stood with his hands behind his back, gazing down at the sect.

He wore a white robe embroidered with blue patterns, cloud-patterned boots, and a jade belt at his waist.

The breeze stirred his hair, lending him an air of transcendent grace.

His face appeared to be in his early forties—clean-shaven, with skin as smooth as jade. His eyes were clear, with pupils as deep as tranquil lakes.

This man was none other than the Master of Ancient Moon Peak, a true immortal of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect!

A being beyond the mundane—a Living Immortal!

"This time, Chen Xuan will lead thirty inner disciples down the mountain. They will depart in the afternoon."

At that moment, someone approached from behind and bowed respectfully.

It was the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall under Ancient Moon Peak.

"I am aware," the Ancient Moon Peak Master said indifferently. "This morning, three true disciples from the main peak—led by the chief disciple, Lu Huaiyuan—have already descended the mountain."

"Lu Huaiyuan’s strength ranks among the very best of those at the 'True Qi' realm in this world," the Law Enforcement Chief said quietly. "It seems the main peak attaches great importance to this matter."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master’s gaze swept across the land before the sect as he spoke slowly.

"The death of the Great Zhou Crown Prince has stirred upheaval across the land, involving the future transition of dynasties and the changes of the mortal world. Naturally, it must be taken seriously."

"But more importantly, they are now speculating about who stands behind Gu King Xin Xuan!"

"For the past six months, Xin Xuan has been hiding in the capital, evading detection. The Great Zhou Dynasty searched everywhere but found no trace of him—not even the Mirror of Mysteries in the Imperial Palace could locate him."

"Everyone assumed Xin Xuan had long fled the capital. Yet now, he has struck again, poisoning the Crown Prince."

"So where was he hiding all this time? Who provided shelter for a barbarian from the Southern Wasteland like him?"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master clasped his hands behind his back. "If Xin Xuan is captured alive and reveals the identity of his 'benefactor,' even I may not remain untouched..."

The Law Enforcement Chief’s expression turned grave. He then recalled the news he had received earlier and bowed.

"At dawn today, the Young Sect Master of the Kunlun Immortal Sect set out toward Xuanling Prefecture!"

"Yesterday, the Buddhist disciple of the Vajra Temple also descended the mountain, heading in the same direction!"

"It seems they have ruled out Jingye Prefecture and Tianyuan Prefecture, focusing solely on Xuanling Prefecture. They are certain Gu King Xin Xuan is trapped there..."

"Rumors say that when Xin Xuan used a treasure to escape, the Young Sect Master of Kunlun happened to be traveling near the capital and recognized the origin of the treasure’s spiritual power."

The Law Enforcement Chief lowered his voice. "Currently, within the Great Zhou, not only the imperial court but also the higher-ups of various sects suspect that the 'benefactor' may still be alive—and Xin Xuan is his man!"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master remained expressionless. "At dawn today, the 'benefactor' sent a message with only one line: Xin Xuan is important."

The Law Enforcement Chief’s face darkened. "Does that mean if Xin Xuan is captured, we must ensure his survival? But Xin Xuan bears the mark of our Ancient Moon Peak—he cannot be taken alive."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master said slowly, "Therefore, he must either escape unscathed or die in Xuanling Prefecture—with his body utterly destroyed."

After a pause, he turned to the Law Enforcement Chief. "I have been ordered to remain at the sect. You will go in my stead. Once I have made the necessary preparations, I will send word. Follow my instructions then. Also... Chen Xuan is leading this mission, with Chen Yang at his side. They may target Li Zhengjing. Keep an eye on him..."

"If that’s the case, Peak Master, why include his name on the roster in the first place?"

The Law Enforcement Chief hesitated. "Though he killed Chen Youyu, Chen Youyu was just a decrepit, weakened waste with negligible strength. In a situation like this, Li Zhengjing is too weak. A single misstep, and he could easily perish..."

"Because he is important. And Xin Xuan is also important."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master said calmly, "I want to see, in this chaos, who the 'benefactor' values more—the two of them."

In the afternoon, Li Zhengjing finished his preparations, a bird perched on his shoulder.

He carried a bundle on his back, from which two tender tree sprouts peeked out.

"Going down the mountain to hunt evil cultivators is no trivial matter. Bringing a bird and a tree—are you here for leisure? Remove them!"

A cold voice rang out abruptly.

Li Zhengjing glanced over and chuckled. "Senior Brother Chen Yang, this junior brother has always been a bit lax. Please bear with me."

Chen Yang stepped forward, his expression icy. "You dare defy me?"

Li Zhengjing quickly bowed apologetically. "Does Senior Brother Chen Yang find my earlier words disrespectful? Then let me rephrase..."

He gripped the hilt of his blade and leaned in. "Listen here, you worthless trash! I tried being polite, but you just won’t take it. If you refuse a toast, you’ll be forced to drink a forfeit! Who the hell do you think you are? If you’re unhappy, suck it up. If you can’t, then kneel and beg me!"

Chen Yang’s face turned livid with fury.

Among the thirty inner disciples on this mission, Li Zhengjing was the newest, having joined less than a month ago. The others had been inner disciples for at least two to three years.

Chen Yang himself had been an inner disciple for seventeen years, with cultivation at the peak of the Inner Energy realm.

In terms of seniority and strength, he was the most senior among this group.

Being publicly humiliated by Li Zhengjing in front of the other disciples was unbearable.

Just as tensions reached a boiling point, an aged voice interrupted.

"Since everyone is present, you may descend the mountain now."

The speaker was none other than Elder Chen Xuan, currently overseeing the Law Enforcement Hall.

He approached, his gaze sweeping briefly over Li Zhengjing.
