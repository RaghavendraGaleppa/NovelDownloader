# Chapter 150: Acting Within the Rules

Under the night sky, a colossal white peacock floated mid-air, its radiating aurora seemingly twisting space, making it impossible for the torrential rain to approach.

"Since wild miraculous medicines were found, why didn't the ancestral court elders 'transplant' them?" an exotic bird asked.

The white peacock shook its head. "Human intervention causes the miraculous blood within them to vanish. It's likely related to the unique environment of the Divine Catastrophe Plain."

Within the tall building, amidst the curtain of rain, Qin Ming was enveloped in a rich medicinal fragrance. He felt as if he were drinking divine nectar, his internal organs glowing with an ethereal mist, celestial energy flowing through him.

He was deeply astonished, for just now, within the blood interwoven with crimson light, he had actually seen the phantom of a fire qilin.

"Tracing the bloodline origin of the Fire-Lin Lion, could it be a terrifying 'quasi-divine creature'?"

He ignored these thoughts, absorbing all the refined medicinal essence into his body. It felt like consuming jade liquid, and the vitality within his flesh and blood noticeably surged!

Qin Ming stood up, experiencing the changes within himself. This fundamental improvement made him clearly feel that he was expanding his future potential.

He felt incredibly satisfied, a look of joy spreading across his face.

"There are many anomalous beings outside, yet I haven't seen any giving birth to miraculous blood within them. Is this related to the environment of this vast plain?" Qin Ming wondered.

At this moment, he increasingly realized that the great ancestral courts, millennium-old aristocratic families, realms beyond the mortal world, and esoteric sects were unfathomable and must have harvested miraculous blood before.

Before this, Qin Ming had never encountered it.

He thought of Cui Chongxuan. When they met at Mount Luofu Immortal, Cui Chongxuan wasn't yet an anomalous person, but was cultivating his physical body with the Six Imperial Heart Sutra.

Yet, not long after, Cui Chongxuan had already stepped into this domain, with the potential to become a core disciple of the Six Imperials.

"A single portion of miraculous blood depleted Black Roc's entire fortune. It seems incredibly precious. I've consecutively refined five kinds of miraculous medicines; how much 'Day Gold' would that be? Moreover, the extent of improvement isn't exaggerated, in fact, it's quite limited. Ordinary people truly cannot afford it!"

Converted, one type of miraculous blood could enhance his initial foundation by nearly thirty jin of strength.

This cost-effectiveness was simply unacceptable to ordinary people.

However, the great ancestral courts and millennium-old aristocratic families considered it very worthwhile.

Because, in their eyes, the number thirty wasn't a unit of jin, but rather seen as future potential.

A portion of miraculous blood might allow a youth close to becoming an anomalous person to step into that realm, gaining greater benefits during their ninth rebirth, which is their final transformation.

Because only anomalous persons can undergo nine rebirths!

"Young anomalous persons" earned this title because their final rebirth brought an extraordinary surge in improvement, distinguishing them from ordinary individuals.

Qin Ming noticed that the medicinal effects of the miraculous blood seemed to be diminishing for him.

"Alas, everything has its limits!" he sighed.

Ultimately, he had underestimated the rarity and preciousness of miraculous blood. Every time he refined a type of miraculous blood, it meant an elder of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court had been "harvested" by him.

The miraculous medicines were still saplings, currently useless to the elders, but if cultivated, they might extend their lives in the future.

Moreover, who doesn't have a favored descendant or a valued disciple?

Qin Ming looked at the rain curtain and said, "I wonder if there are other areas in the Divine Catastrophe Plain where wondrous creatures are giving birth to miraculous blood."

Then, he turned and asked, "You've collected my jade-iron arrows that I left behind in the Wolf Hall, haven't you?"

"All here!" The old donkey quickly nodded, thoroughly frightened, as several old demons and the man from the Quasi-God Society had all been killed.

Which one wasn't stronger than it? Now, all its "big brothers" on the mountain lay dead, and only it, the little subordinate, was still alive!

Qin Ming practiced archery in the rain, focused and serious. The "Arrow Scripture" opened up a whole new realm of archery for him; wind, rain, thunder, and other elements could all be utilized to imbue the arrows with essence, qi, and spirit!

Originally just techniques, the "Arrow Scripture" now sublimated them, involving a higher realm of artistic conception: where the heart wills, the arrow goes, striking true with every shot!

"I've only practiced the archery of the Wu family of Black-White Mountain, and I've already caught up to you." Qin Ming felt that the Arrow Scripture falling into the big hedgehog's hands was like casting a pearl before swine.

Having obtained the complete "Arrow Scripture," he naturally intended to carry it forward and make it flourish.

The old donkey's gaze changed. No wonder this human youth was as terrifying as a demon god; he cultivated diligently every moment, truly undeterred by wind or rain.

Qin Ming's archery improved rapidly. He already possessed superb archery skills, and with the mastery of the "Arrow Scripture's" secrets and special force techniques, his progress was swift!

As for the big hedgehog's experience and insights, they were all dross to him, entirely discarded.

He wasn't being arrogant; it was simply the truth. So-called master-level attainments were nothing more than this!

Just like before, the weasel also claimed to be a master of blade arts in this region, yet it hadn't mastered the Blade Control Art after twenty years of practice, while Qin Ming had already mastered it after obtaining the complete blade manual.

Even more difficult miraculous arts, such as the Blazing Fire Scripture and the Golden Silkworm Scripture, which he received as handwritten copies, he also managed to cultivate those profound force techniques in a very short time.

Subsequently, Qin Ming went to practice the "Blazing Sun Sword Scripture." This was also a unique art, and he felt that the second-in-command of the Quasi-God Society practiced it too crudely.

Once truly cultivated to a certain realm, the sword in hand should be like the blazing sun, capable of illuminating all directions and sweeping away demons from all eight wastes!

Yet, in that man's hand, the heavy sword merely carried a fiery glow, far from the blazing sun, a qualitative difference.

After Qin Ming obtained the "Blazing Sun Sword Scripture," he naturally discarded its dross-like experiences and insights, thus grasping it faster and stronger himself.

By now, only original ancient texts, embodying the crystallized essence of the scripture's creators, were worth his reference.

What he sought to comprehend was why the scriptures were created, and the mental journey of those past sages!

All others were not worth learning from.

Subsequently, Qin Ming went to study the incomplete copy of the "Black Roc Scripture."

The old donkey was stunned. In a trance, it seemed to see its 'big brother' transform into human form, sweeping through the downpour, radiating a fierce aura, terrifying claw techniques, and swift movements that made its heart tremble.

Qin Ming absorbed the miraculous blood essence, practiced the Arrow Scripture and Blazing Sun Sword Art, broke into a sweat, felt completely comfortable, and was in high spirits, but also a little hungry.

He commanded, "Roast the Black Roc. Let's see what roc meat tastes like."

Upon hearing this, Lu Chongxiao's entire donkey body went numb. Was it being told to personally roast its "big brother"?!

Late at night, the building was filled with a rich aroma. After carefully tasting, Qin Ming concluded that hedgehog meat tasted good, Fire-Lin Lion meat was not great, being slightly fishy and sour, but roc meat and brocade sparrow wings were fragrant when roasted.

However, his favorite was still the donkey meat in the iron pot, which was tender, chewy, and greatly suited his taste.

It wasn't that he intentionally "killed the donkey after it had done its work"; it was mainly because this old donkey kept thinking, "A gentleman's revenge is never too late, even after three hundred years." How could he tolerate that?

It had once endured for a hundred years, slaughtering the descendants of its previous master. This time, it inwardly encouraged itself, that after three hundred years, if this human youth's lifespan ended, it would then go and slay his offspring.

Qin Ming had long since spiritually resonated with its intense emotional fluctuations, so naturally, he had to send it on its way.

"So much demon beast flesh, and I can't eat it all by myself, what a waste!" He didn't notify the villages to come and collect the meat; this wasn't human territory, traveling was quite dangerous, and they could easily be retaliated against by anomalous beings afterward.

Most importantly, in the frontier areas of the Great Opening, the land was vast and sparsely populated. The fire-cultivated fields tilled by the border residents were exceptionally fertile and yielded abundant harvests. If not for the recent demon attacks, this place would be very livable.

"I'm pioneering this land!" Qin Ming realized that by intruding into demon territory and slaughtering countless ancient demons, he had long since overfulfilled the requirements of this assessment.

As he thought of these things, a shadow appeared in his heart.

When Black Roc, Fire-Lin Lion, Silver Wolf King, and other demons ambushed him, there had been humans who delivered messages for them. Did this involve the Six Imperial Ancestral Court?

After all, they were in charge of the local assessment.

If there was any shadow of the Six Imperials, he wanted to escape immediately, subdue a bird demon, and embark on his journey alone.

However, a return journey of forty thousand li was quite far. The endless dark territory held numerous dangers; ordinary fierce birds simply couldn't cross it and could easily be hunted by unknown creatures along the way.

Qin Ming pondered seriously, concluding that the fundamental rules of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court were still in effect.

If someone could truly cover the sky with one hand and there was a major issue, they would simply come and kill him directly; how could he possibly survive then?

Qin Ming breathed a sigh of relief. After eating and drinking his fill, he set off amidst the heavy rain.

Lightning tore through the night sky, and heavy rain covered the entire vast plain. In the boundless forest, raindrops splattered, shrouding it in a thin mist.

In the rainy night, Qin Ming was like a banished immortal, carried by green mist, stepping on vegetation, each step spanning a great distance.

His whole body was enveloped in green light, ethereal and almost immortal. The Yi Wood essence of the entire vast plain was at his disposal, submerging him.

As Qin Ming traveled, not only did he feel no fatigue, but the Yi Wood spirit medicine entered his body, the essence of mountains, rivers, and vegetation constantly purifying his flesh, blood, and spirit.

After the battle at Black Roc Mountain, he had consumed four types of miraculous medicines, which truly extended his lifespan, increased his potential, and enhanced his strength. Having tasted the benefits, he decided to strike again.

This time, his target was the leader of the Quasi-God Society!

And incidentally, he wanted to find out if there was truly any shadow of the Six Imperials behind this matter.

"Here!"

It was only fifty li. Qin Ming, driving the Yi Wood essence, quickly arrived. Green mist and the fresh vitality of vegetation supported him, making him appear exceptionally ethereal and transcendent.

A large mountain stood ahead, the stronghold of the Quasi-God Society. On ordinary days, no one dared to challenge it; it was an extremely dangerous territory.

Qin Ming silently ascended the mountain. Here were beast monsters, bird demons, and also humans, a complex mix. Its leader, deep within the Night Mist World, was a "quasi-divine creature," and he didn't know the original intention behind its creation of this organization.

That night, at the Quasi-God Society's stronghold, the mountaintop was lashed by a torrential downpour. One abnormal lightning bolt after another struck, causing a cliff to collapse, sending massive rocks tumbling down.

Many members were shocked. What was happening?

When the crimson lightning flashed, why did they see figures moving crisscross, seemingly in battle?

"That's the boss fighting someone to the death!"

Some demon beasts charged up, and some humans also rushed to the mountaintop, but soon screams erupted.

In this battle, Qin Ming found it very challenging. He had observed in secret for a long time, only making his move to hunt after confirming the leader of the Quasi-God Society's power level.

Unexpectedly, this person was even more formidable than he had imagined.

Because he came from a prestigious lineage, from the Five Elements Palace, though merely a discarded disciple, having long since rebelled against the great sect renowned throughout the Night Mist World.

This person's name was Sun Teng. He had already stepped into the Outer Saint Realm many years ago, mastering more than one top-tier miraculous art, with his most proficient being the "Withering and Prospering Scripture."

He could not only absorb the essence of vegetation from this plain but also comprehend the changes of Yin and Yang from the cycles of withering and prospering, making his abilities extremely powerful.

He used the transformations of withering and prospering to conceal his aura, even deceiving Qin Ming.

Qin Ming, with the Tyrant King's Last Will as his core, utilized the special extreme weather of the night to summon wind and thunder, unleashing them to kill his opponent.

However, Sun Teng, having thoroughly comprehended the Yin and Yang transformations of the "Withering and Prospering Scripture," actually used Yin and Yang energies to neutralize some of the lightning.

If Qin Ming hadn't refined three miraculous medicines at Black Roc Mountain, boosting his potential and strength, he and Sun Teng would have been evenly matched tonight, with the outcome uncertain.

At this moment, the mountaintop was a mess. The ground had long since ruptured, with many scorched areas, and numerous corpses lay sprawled—all members of the Quasi-God Society. Some had died from lightning, others were cleaved to death by Qin Ming's suet-jade iron saber.

"What a pity, I didn't get the top-tier miraculous art, the 'Withering and Prospering Scripture.' Sun Teng's will is as hard as iron; no wonder he could achieve such success," he sighed softly, feeling quite regretful.

Such a ruthless person had no emotional fluctuations, and his willpower was incredibly strong.

"The foundation of the great sects is too profound; their direct disciples certainly don't lack miraculous arts."

Qin Ming learned here that the reason he was exposed was because he had once invited a fellow practitioner on the Divine Catastrophe Plain to kill the Silver Wolf King, and then he was sold out.

He was somewhat distracted. At the time, he had even helped that person slay a demon, yet not only did the other party show no gratitude, but they also gave him such a "big gift."

Qin Ming found this person among the corpses on the mountaintop, already split in half by his saber.

"I can't delve deeper; this matter ends here!"

Qin Ming took off his tattered "rags," searched around, put on a brand-new set of clothes, and then, controlling the Yi Wood essence, departed into the distance, his wide sleeves fluttering, like an immortal on a journey.

The next day, Elder Zhou Tao of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, seated on a fierce bird, personally arrived at the Divine Catastrophe Plain and questioned the white peacock suspended high in the sky.

"The time is almost up. Have there been any incidents? Is everything still proceeding according to the rules?" He was very polite to the white peacock, treating it as an equal.

Because the other party was truly very strong!

The colossal white peacock nodded. "There have been some situations. Oh, and it also involves you, Elder Zhou."

"Oh, what is it?" Zhou Tao grew serious.

The white peacock informed him, "Elder Zhou, your miraculous medicine has been harvested by someone. Not only that, the wild medicines discovered by other ancestral court elders have also been picked."

"What?! Who is breaking the rules?!" Zhou Tao raised his voice.

The white peacock said, "One of the youths, acting within the rules, uprooted several miraculous medicines completely."
