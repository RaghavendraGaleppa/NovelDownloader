# Chapter 194: The Uprising Begins

"Dear Junior Brother Yunfan:

Seeing these words is like seeing your face. Last night, observing the stars, I saw the Weixiu constellation tilting westward. I suspect that when Master was in Qingzhou, he encountered obstacles and could not escape, and certainly needed some assistance.

Now the Great Qian has captured the seven states of Yanbei, the Nine耀 Sect only protects its mountain gate, and the Great Zhou government turns a blind eye, competing for power and profit.

This trip of your foolish senior brother is not for the greater good of the common people, but only to fulfill personal bonds of human ethics. Without Master, forty-five years ago on that snowy night, I would have been a beggar who became food in a wild dog's belly. Without him exhausting his efforts to reshape my bones and muscles, how could there be a Fu Jin in this world?"

A wet stain suddenly spread across the paper, as if the writer had paused here.

Xu Yunfan's fingertips traced the crease, recalling how when Fu Jin first entered the sect, he had clung to Zhan Yan's arm and wept loudly, saying the Divine Weapon Ridge had a successor. Though Zhan Yan beat and scolded Fu Jin, in reality, their affection was profound.

"...I still remember the first lesson Master taught me, ordering me to guard the forging furnace for three months and observe the fire. He said, 'If the heat control is off by one breath, the weapon will be weaker by three parts.' Yet when I collapsed from high fever, he used the Red Python Qi to force the heat toxin out of my body. Now thinking back, the burn scars on his palm were all left from protecting my heart meridians that year."

The edge of the letter suddenly curled with fine frayed edges. Xu Yunfan tapped it lightly with his hammer handle, and half a yellowed page drifted out from the夹层—it was actually a拜师 letter written by Zhan Yan thirty years ago.

The childish, crooked handwriting read: "Willing to forge iron and bury Master."

But Zhan Yan had corrected it with a red brush: "Foolish child, it should be 'forge the sword and sharpen its edge'."

"The third shelf in the cellar of the Forging Hall holds seventeen of Master's broken swords. At each notch, I carved the character '晋'. They were the traces of his restraint when testing techniques, fearing he might injure me. Your foolish senior brother is clumsy, making Master exhaust his mind and energy. It took many bitter days to reach this point. If only I had one-tenth of Junior Brother's talent, Master wouldn't have aged so much. If I cannot find Master this time..."

The ink here suddenly turned sharp, tearing through three layers of paper.

"I, your foolish senior brother, will shatter the twelve peaks of Yanbei and exhaust the earth veins of Qingzhou! Even if I burn all my Red Python blood, I will obtain news of Master!"

"All matters of the Forging Hall afterward are entrusted to Junior Brother. Junior Brother is Master's hope. Do not be lazy—be diligent in your cultivation. For the continuation of the Heavenly Work Cave, the Forging Hall, and the Divine Weapon Ridge lineage...

If I do not return from this journey, then I shall not return."

The final signature was not Fu Jin's usual star seal, but the private seal of the character "Father" that Zhan Yan had taught him to carve in his early years.

Calculating the time, Master Zhan Yan is already over eighty-seven this year.

Gazing at the letter for a long time, Xu Yunfan only raised his head somewhat dazedly when the sun was already high in the courtyard, looking at the disciple who had been standing by his side all along.

"I know you. You are Senior Brother Fu's disciple, Fu Li?"

He remembered that Fu Jin once said Fu Li had good talent. He was an abandoned infant Fu Jin picked up on the road back to the Heavenly Work Cave from Cuibo City in Cangzhou. Fu Jin truly raised him with his own hands.

"Yes, Martial Uncle Xu. Master instructed me to give you this letter and to obey all your commands."

Fu Li's eyes were somewhat red. The scene of Fu Li leaving hurriedly last night remained vivid in his mind.

"Go on down first. All matters of the Forging Hall shall proceed as usual, until your Master returns... If there are any matters difficult to decide, come find me immediately. If you have any doubts about martial arts or forging, come straight to me."

"Yes!"

Fu Li first agreed, then said: "Martial Uncle, two days later, the Forging Hall is recruiting new disciples. They need you to go see..."

"Call me when the time comes."

After Fu Li left, Xu Yunfan carefully folded the letter and placed it in the drawer under his desk. Had he kept it on his person, once a battle erupted and Qi surged, it would easily be torn to shreds.

This letter was essentially a托孤信—a letter entrusting his orphan.

A considerable portion was devoted to urging him not to seek comfort and idleness, but to cultivate diligently.

"Senior Brother, Senior Brother, you really have given me a huge problem."

Xu Yunfan exhaled. This letter almost made him unable to resist preparing to leave the sect to find Fu Jin, but the subsequent matters of the Forging Hall entangled him. If he also left, then the morale of the Forging Hall would truly scatter.

Fu Li was still young, only seventeen or eighteen years old, at the second level of the Warrior realm, unable to take charge of the overall situation. Only Xu Yunfan, bearing the reputation of a genius, could suppress those with sinister intentions by being able to逆杀 (counter-kill) the Flesh Refining realm despite being at the External Three Unifications realm.

The incident where he explosively killed Bao Yan of the Hidden Blade Pavilion had shaken many people.

Although Bao Yan's strength was lacking, he was still a half-step Blood Transformation expert.

He needed to grow stronger quickly to cope with the increasingly difficult situations ahead.

The Great Zhou had already completely fallen into chaos.

In Yanbei Dao, the state capital of Youzhou, Beiliang, was only separated from Jiuyao State's Nine耀 Sect by Shuo State.

When the north wind blowing from distant mountains, carrying the scent of rust, slammed against the city bricks, the sentries on Beiliang's city walls saw the shadows squirming on the horizon.

Thirty thousand dragon-scale armor pieces reflected the morning sun simultaneously, spreading a patch of pulsing blood light across the plain. The sound of armor plates clashing arrived with the rumble of marching, even drowning out the warning bronze gongs on the city walls.

"Enemy attack!!!"

The sentry on the city wall, accompanying his piercing roar, shot a cloud-piercing arrow into the sky, and the alarm sounded throughout the city in an instant.

The crenellations of Beiliang's walls trembled.

When the iron torrent crushed over the moat, the iron-clad gate of Beiliang's south gate was letting out a dying moan.

The moment eight hundred throwing spears tore through the morning mist, the city defense crossbowmen saw a scene they would never forget.

The Eagle-Rang scouts' bare right arms were knotted with muscles. The instant the fine steel throwing spears left their hands, the shafts, squeezed by the immense force, produced crisp sounds of wood fibers snapping.

When the spear points pierced through the iron-clad shields, the shield-bearing Beiliang warriors were shaken back three steps, the blood beads oozing from their虎口 (tiger's mouths) spreading like red plums on the shield surface.

When Tuoba Lie's war boots shattered the first渡河石板 (river-crossing stone slab), Zhao Duanhai, the Beiliang city colonel known as the Northern Spear King, was twisting his waist and thrusting his spear from the crenellation.

The twelve-foot iron spear turned into a cold star aiming straight for the throat, but was caught from below by the meteorite war axe. The two immense forces collided, and Zhao Duanhai's sleeves on both arms burst with a "tearing" sound, revealing the blue veins on his forearms jumping like living snakes.

The spear shaft bent into an arc amidst a grating friction sound. Tuoba Lie suddenly spun his hips, and the axe, leveraging the waist's rotational force, swung back in a slashing arc, its edge scraping a three-foot-long trail of sparks on the city wall's bricks and stones.

At this moment, the瓮城 (walled city) gate let out a dying groan.

The back muscles of the four bare-chested strongmen, as the ram was pulled back,绷成钢板 (tensed into steel plates). When the iron-clad ram struck the gate pivot for the third time, the strongest of the strongmen suddenly let out a fierce shout, the veins on his neck bulging like earthworms.

Amidst the crisp sound of the axle snapping, his spine let out a不堪重负 (unbearably burdened) creak, yet he still maintained the姿势 (pose) of a bow stance pushing a mountain, until the city gate collapsed with a rumble.

"Arrow formation!"

Tuoba Lie's voice was like rolling thunder.

The front row of heavy infantry used their shoulders to brace their shields, the muscles on their legs bulging in块块 (lumps). When the tower shields组成的 (forming) triangular formation crashed into the Beiliang city army's sword formation, amidst the clang of metal, there were mixed sounds of shin bones snapping.

The strongman wielding twin halberds突进 (charged) through the gaps in the shield formation. The halberd tips locked onto two朴刀 (broad-bladed knives) and twisted violently. The wrist joints of the Cangzhou warrior instantly twisted backwards, and wood chips from the knife handles drifted down from between his fingers.
