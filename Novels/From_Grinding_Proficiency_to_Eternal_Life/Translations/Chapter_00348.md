# Chapter 348: Opening the Stage

Dugu Jiu turned to face Xu Yunfan directly. "According to ancient clues, only where the Heavenly Demons dwell can true Immortal Fate be found. Now that spiritual energy is recovering, Bi Yuan and the others naturally deduce that the Heavenly Demons are about to make a comeback. The fluctuations in the Great Zhou's Dragon Vein will undoubtedly accelerate this. Perhaps once the Ritual of the Heavenly Grand Ceremony is completed, those Heavenly Demons will descend."

He suddenly shifted his tone. "Do you know why the Dao Sect is willing to expend the Ritual of the Heavenly Grand Ceremony, even draining the Great Zhou's Dragon Vein?"

Seeing Xu Yunfan deep in thought, Dugu Jiu continued, "It is precisely to use this path to the heavens to create an existence capable of fighting the Heavenly Demons. And you..."

His gaze was like a torch. "If you utilize the Thousand Methods Returning to the Flow to break through the Ninth Realm, the perfect fusion of the Ten Extremities True Qi might allow you to fight the Heavenly Demons. The极道 masters who broke through the shackles of the Ninth Realm and achieved the Land Immortal Realm back then were also able to slay Heavenly Demons."

By the time the waning moon sank in the west, Dugu Jiu departed, stepping through the dew-covered ground.

During these two hours, this peak Ninth Realm powerhouse who had suppressed an entire era three hundred years ago showed only excitement and eagerness when mentioning Heavenly Demons, without a trace of fear.

Xu Yunfan carefully sensed his surroundings to confirm the other party had truly left before lowering his gaze. He sat cross-legged, began forming the Seal of Lin, and recited the Heart Mantra of the Highest Good is Like Water.

An unknown amount of time passed before a message popped up in his vision.

*‘You practiced diligently, your spirit became increasingly condensed, proficiency in the Lin Character Art increased by 1.’*

Currently, the cultivation of the Lin Character Art was as slow as a turtle. Since reaching minor success, the proficiency required for great success seemed endlessly distant.

At dawn the next day, Xu Yunfan looked out through the pavilion window. In the morning light, the Black Tortoise Arena, which had been destroyed by the Ten Extremities True Qi yesterday, had already been completely renovated.

Cracks on the obsidian base were filled with gold-inlaid steel, and the broken coiling dragon pillars were re-carved from whole pieces of green jade.

He had to admire the craftsmen of the Great Zhou's Ministry of Works dressed in dark official robes; they were not much different from the disciples of the Ministry of Works in the Heavenly Work Cavern.

The battlefield where the Xuanzhen Gate's sword qi and the Nine Yao Sect's fierce flames had run rampant last night now had even the floor tile patterns renewed, as if the Ninth Realm battle that shook Yujing had never happened.

If not for the collapsed ruins surrounding the area still reminding everyone that a fierce battle had taken place here.

On the Black Tortoise Arena, where the morning mist had yet to disperse, although it had been rebuilt to look brand new, the air still retained the scorch marks left by last night's sword qi.

When Xu Yunfan stepped onto the obsidian floor tiles glowing with a faint green light, subtle spiritual energy fluctuations came from beneath his feet, causing him to frown slightly.

These spiritual energy fluctuations formed some kind of array, interfering with his absorption of the surrounding spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

Six hundred zhang away.

"The resonance of the Spirit Suppressing Jade has reached seventy percent."

Inside the Ministry of Works observation tower, the Ministry of Works Secretary turned a mechanical lever toward the Black Tortoise Arena direction. On the instrument, three spiritual jade pieces were trembling violently. Seeing this scene, he wiped the sweat from his forehead.

"Xu Yunfan is still devouring spiritual energy... The Spirit Suppressing Jade embedded by the Ministry of Works probably won't last past noon."

The Ministry of Works Vice Minister, wearing a dark peacock badge, sneered upon hearing this. "All three hundred and sixty pieces of Spirit Suppressing Jade were taken from the cold veins of the Kunlun Ruins. They will hold."

He suddenly lowered his voice. "When the Dao Sect used the Nail Dragon Technique to forcefully extract the Dragon Vein, did they ever think we could use the same principle of the earth's veins to counter it?"

A Thousand Households of the Imperial City Division suddenly interjected from the corner: "Don't forget, if Xu Yunfan truly possesses the Ten Extremities Martial Arts created by the Heavenly Sword Dugu Jiu from three hundred years ago as rumored..."

"Shut up!"

The Vice Minister sharply interrupted. "What Her Majesty wants is not speculation! If you still can't suppress the pouring of the Xuanhuang Qi by the third quarter of noon, everyone can wait to collect the corpses of their families!"

The Thousand Households opened his mouth, moved his lips, and finally let out a silent sigh.

This was originally a job where the whole family would die if things went wrong.

That Xu Yunfan was simply a freak, and the Dao Sect had set up the Ritual of the Heavenly Grand Ceremony. Even if the three monks of the Amitabha Monastery had gone to investigate, they still had no particularly good solution after arriving in Yujing City.

The Dao Sect had existed for a much longer time than the Great Zhou; who knows what shocking things are hidden inside.

On the arena, Xu Yunfan gently stomped his foot and raised an eyebrow.

"Quite interesting."

He swept his gaze over the collapsed walls around him. Standing at the shattered white marble railings, where the Ten Extremities True Qi shockwaves had hit yesterday, were several figures with profound and heavy auras.

Nine Yao Sect's purple-robed长老, Xuanzhen Gate's newly appointed Sect Master.

Three female cultivators from the Penglai Pavilion in the East Sea, and beside them a figure over a zhang tall, entirely shrouded in a cloak...

Aside from the Dao Sect, the other five major sects were all present.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept around with a hint of provocation, causing the expressions of the crowd to turn icy cold.

"Let him be arrogant for now. He will regret it soon," the Tianxuan Sword Master of the Sword Pavilion sneered.

The Xuanzhen Gate's blue-robed Taoist priest had a cold expression, merely channeling his Dragon and Tiger True Qi into the divine weapon at his waist to build up power, remaining silent.

"The final round of the Imperial Martial Arts Tournament, begin!"

The moment the old steward's hoarse voice rang out.

Xu Yunfan looked at the three monks of the Amitabha Monastery appearing on the stage and was somewhat stunned.

He sneered and turned to look at the high platform: "Old Steward, when did the arena rules become three against one?"

The hunched old man tremblingly unrolled a bright yellow silk scroll: "The Amitabha Monastery's 'Vajra Subduing Demon Sutra' records that the three monks of Suffering, Hardship, and Calamity cultivate the 'Three as One' secret technique, their qi mechanisms are linked, and their souls resonate together."

Meeting Xu Yunfan's highly aggressive gaze, he swallowed the second half of his sentence, his throat bobbing. The red seal at the end of the silk scroll was clearly the dual seals of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau and the Imperial City Division. "According to the seventh clause of the Great Zhou's 'Imperial Martial Arts Code', they can... can be regarded as one person."

"What a fine 'Three as One'!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly burst into loud laughter, feeling truly speechless. Was this really exercising the final interpretation right?

The Fire Devouring Dragon Whip ignited with a blazing white flame in his palm. "Then today, I shall send you all..."

The dragon patterns on the whip body suddenly lit up in succession, a dragon roar suddenly erupted, and the red crystal scales on the whip body stood up one by one.

"To the Western Paradise together!"

"Benefactor, your words are too many."

The sound of Compassion Suffering accompanied the blade light that first tore through the morning mist. Where the blade edge passed, even the air stirred up turbid white waves.

This demon weapon inherited from the Great Qian period specifically countered the operation of true qi, yet Xu Yunfan charged straight at the blade light. The Ten Extremities True Qi formed a spiral vortex inside his body; this was a variation of the Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall's "Earth Dragon's Turnover".

The moment Compassion Suffering's Profound Yin Soul-Slaying Blade cut into the vortex, the whip body suddenly exploded with thousands of red crystals, like erupting magma. Each shard of crystal carried the Ten Extremities True Qi, condensed to the point of near substance, and erupted with intense flames.

Compassion Suffering's Divine Armor Cassock couldn't withstand it at all and instantly vaporized. The old monk realized with shock that this exploding Ten Extremities True Qi was actually so tyrannical.

"Suppress!"

At this time, Compassion Calamity seized the opportunity to slam the Dragon Suppressing Seal onto the ground.

The earth veins, secretly altered by the Ministry of Works last night, suddenly boiled.

Nine dragon veins converging into Xuanhuang chains burst out from the ground beneath Xu Yunfan's feet.

Compassion Hardship, seeing this, urgently scattered the Thousand Mechanism Powder. Driven by true qi, the poison mist that could stagnate true qi instantly enveloped Xu Yunfan's surroundings!

Xu Yunfan showed no panic whatsoever, even with a hint of mockery. The Ten Extremities True Qi could be divided into ten different types of strength, allowing him to transform all techniques. How could he be restricted by this? These people thought they understood the Ten Extremities Martial Arts, but they were far too naive.

*(I returned late today, sorry everyone, I will continue to work hard tomorrow!)*
