# Chapter 14: Mid-Grade Spirit Stones

After the young woman retrieved her small sword, perhaps feeling a bit guilty, she said to Zhao Di, "See what's inside the storage pouch; there should be plenty of good stuff in there. It's all yours." As she said this, she couldn't help but let out a cunning smile. She was clearly just feigning generosity.

If that young man had possessed any better magical artifacts, he surely would have used them just now. Therefore, there likely wouldn't be anything valuable in the storage pouch.

How could Zhao Di know the deception behind this? He still thought this was the young woman's gratitude for saving her life, and that she was voluntarily giving him all the items.

As instructed, he infused a small amount of spiritual energy into the storage pouch. Then, with a gentle shake, he emptied all the items from within. There was a worn-out book and over a dozen stones of various colors.

These stones were Spirit Stones. As the name suggests, Spirit Stones are stones that contain a certain amount of spiritual energy. These stones, imbued with spiritual energy, are incredibly versatile for cultivators. When meditating for cultivation, as long as one holds a Spirit Stone in their hand, they can rapidly absorb the spiritual energy from the stone and convert it into their own spiritual energy, much faster than normally breathing in spiritual qi, thus greatly reducing the time spent in meditation. Furthermore, whether refining magical artifacts or setting up spirit formations, a certain quantity and quality of Spirit Stones are required. Especially for setting up spirit formations, they rely entirely on Spirit Stones to supply spiritual energy; the power of a formation is directly linked to the amount of spiritual energy contained within the Spirit Stones used. Thus, almost every cultivator cannot do without Spirit Stones, and Spirit Stones have become the general equivalent in the cultivation world, similar to the gold and silver of the mortal world.

Based on the amount of spiritual energy they contain, Spirit Stones can be divided into three categories: Low-Grade Spirit Stones, Mid-Grade Spirit Stones, and High-Grade Spirit Stones. Mid-Grade Spirit Stones contain approximately one hundred times the spiritual energy of Low-Grade Spirit Stones, but their price is slightly higher than one hundred Low-Grade Spirit Stones. This is because higher-grade Spirit Stones can provide more spiritual energy at once and have a wider range of uses. Moreover, in various Spirit Stone veins, the number of Mid-Grade Spirit Stones is far less than that of Low-Grade Spirit Stones. As for High-Grade Spirit Stones, although their spiritual energy is also about one hundred times that of Mid-Grade Spirit Stones, their value is generally recognized to be over one thousand times that of Mid-Grade Spirit Stones.

This is because High-Grade Spirit Stones are extremely rare; scarcity makes them valuable. It is mentioned in the books of the Jian Family's scripture pavilion that perhaps only the legendary Nascent Soul stage old monsters can possess such rare items. As for any special uses of High-Grade Spirit Stones, the book did not contain detailed records.

Zhao Di himself possessed three Low-Grade Spirit Stones, namely a light red Fire-attribute Spirit Stone, a light blue Water-attribute Spirit Stone, and a green Wood-attribute Spirit Stone. All of these were relatively common Low-Grade Spirit Stones. Among the dozen or so Spirit Stones before him, however, there was one that was clearly different.
