# Chapter 185: Humans, Gods, and Ghosts All Emerge

The dilapidated small courtyard was quiet, isolated from the town's clamor and strife. Moss grew on the stone steps, and vines climbed the院墙 (courtyard walls).

Wu Yaozu's eyes were bloodshot, tears clinging to his full beard, filled with reluctance.

"Why are you crying? You'll forget Grandma once you have a wife outside," the old lady said, smiling.

She placed a jade pendant, carved with a divine image, around Little Wu's neck, reminding him not to take it off on the journey. Then she looked at Qin Ming, cautioning, "That piece of cloth on you, I can't discern its origin, but it shouldn't be simple. Carry it with you as you travel."

Qin Ming immediately understood; there would likely be a section of the road "haunted by malevolent spirits," and he needed to carry something to "suppress evil."

"Grandma, you have to help me collect debts later. Those old geezers are dishonest, all saying they didn't bring their bets and will pay next time," Wu Yaozu complained.

"Alright, I know," the old lady nodded.

In the peculiar small town, various transactions took place, with information trading being the most common, followed by the sale of soul elixirs and the exchange of cultivation techniques.

Suddenly, a purple glow erupted from the divine temple, accompanied by rolling thunder. This heavenly might was terrifying, changing the complexions of even some old cultivators.

"What's happening? It feels like it's coming for us."

"Oh no, Grandma, my soul is going to be shattered!"

...

Chaos ensued. The four-tusked white elephant collapsed, and the golden-haired elder on its back was struck by a purple divine mace, leaving him scorched and swaying.

It was an unprovoked disaster. They felt utterly wronged; they hadn't provoked the temple, never even entered it, so why were they being attacked?

"Crack, boom,噼里啪啦 (crackle, pop)!"

Above the town, purple energy covered everything, and bolts of thunder continuously struck down. A divine mace soared through the sky, periodically diving down. Wherever someone powerful was, or a specific location, it would be targeted with重点打击 (focused strikes). A group of people screamed in pain, fleeing in disarray.

It could only be said that there were indeed formidable individuals here, possibly senior cultivators, who withstood multiple strikes from the purple divine mace and still managed to get up quickly.

"Alright, that's enough," the black-robed figure in the temple reminded.

Traveling in the morning meant the body might disintegrate, while traveling at night could lead to soul departure. Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu began their journey at noon, personally escorted by the old lady, and were already on their way.

Along the path, a crimson mist permeated the air, and various inexplicable cries rose and fell. One moment, someone would be howling, the next, a piercing laugh, and soon after, mournful wails. Moreover, within the blood-colored haze, shadowy figures flickered, often approaching. If not for the old lady accompanying them, emitting a divine radiance to protect them, the two would certainly not have been able to pass.

"This is... too terrifying!" Even Wu Yaozu, a local, felt his scalp tingle.

A腥臭气味 (foul, bloody stench) assaulted them as a large black claw descended. Not to mention its main body, even its dripping, sharp talons were several meters long. However, when it touched the divine light emitted by Grandma Wu, it hissed and burned, quickly retreating with a roar.

Qin Ming's expression changed. This section of the road was truly dangerous; if it were just him and Wu Yaozu, they would never make it through.

Amidst the damp, putrid smell, a dozen-meter-long tongue appeared, accompanied by a gigantic, ghastly pale face that drew near, attempting to lick them. With a rumble, it was pierced by the divine light emitted by the old lady, exploding completely.

Nearby, various shadows, dense and numerous, appeared, incredibly colossal, standing like mountains. Any casually extended claw could obscure half the sky. Dark clouds pressed down, revealing themselves to be merely insect wings, as a sharp proboscis extended, seemingly piercing the night sky.

Thump, thump...

The ground shook as enormous footsteps passed nearby, causing even hundreds of kilograms of rocks to bounce.

In the blood-colored mist, it was as if various ghosts and gods were traveling, a chaotic dance of demons, a scene of doomsday. How could an ordinary person survive encountering this?

The old lady reprimanded, "You've been dead for so many years, why are you bothering the locals now? A bunch of cowards! I never saw you act so tough back then. When the Absolute Land was breached, you all trembled like frightened chickens before being slaughtered."

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming felt his hair stand on end. These demons and monsters, just by their size, were clearly formidable back then. Yet, when faced with that inexplicable existence, they were all incredibly weak? It could only mean that whoever breached the Fourth Absolute Land back then was terrifyingly powerful!

At this moment, the old lady resembled a divine statue, enveloped in pure Yang light, leading the way, either repelling or igniting various towering figures.

All along the way, there were endless demons, wailing ghosts and gods, and countless strange monsters. It was truly like traversing hell.

Little Wu also felt his hair stand on end. Was this his hometown? What kind of monsters were those predecessors? Were their ancestors all so imposing? Huge like mountains, bizarrely shaped.

They remained silent throughout the journey, rushing outwards, finally reaching the edge of the Fourth Absolute Land.

Upon arriving, the old lady stopped. She could not go further, seemingly restrained by a power, unable to break free from the Absolute Land's shackles. Faintly, one could see what looked like chains connected to her back, now pulled taut and straight; this was her limit.

"Grandma!" Wu Yaozu immediately cried upon seeing this.

"Foolish child, I'm fine. This isn't so bad either. Having attachments means one has a home. That's the path I came from, lest I get lost," the old lady comforted.

Finally, she wiped Little Wu's tears and looked at Qin Ming, saying, "Child, help me look after Little Wu for two months. He adapts quickly; he'll get used to the outside world."

Qin Ming immediately nodded, saying, "Please don't worry."

Lastly, the old lady charted a path for them, with a map, telling them absolutely not to take a wrong turn, as the external areas of the Absolute Land were not entirely peaceful either.

"Even if there are twists and turns, it's not a big problem. Both of you, go forward boldly, don't scare yourselves!" the old lady waved.

As Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu took a step forward, the entire world changed. They immediately felt less suppressed. The wailing ghosts and gods, and the mountain-sized figures from the previous moment, all vanished. Here, it was incredibly quiet, with the sound of insects chirping in the distance.

They looked back. The night wind rustled through the forest, and further away, mountains stretched across the horizon. As they walked back into the forest, it was not the path they had come from; the Fourth Absolute Land had simply disappeared.

Qin Ming said, "All unknown and mystery stems from our insufficient strength and cultivation. We just need to cultivate diligently."

"Mhm!" Wu Yaozu nodded, secretly vowing that once he was strong enough, he would definitely bring his wife back to see Grandma.

Then, he shaved off his beard, and his physical appearance changed. His sturdy frame grew taller, and his black hair quickly fell out, leaving only a head of short golden hair. This was his true face: robust, with sharp eyes, strong facial features, and distinct angles. Not handsome, but full of vigor. In the peculiar small town, no one revealed their true appearance.

"What are your plans for the future?" Qin Ming asked him.

Wu Yaozu replied, "I'm going with you to Kunling Giant City. My grandma said the rainbow transformation path cannot be followed to the end; viewing the physical body as a prison has issues. I want to visit the major cultivation sites and academies."

Qin Ming said, "I've wanted to say this for a while, the moon in the Fourth Absolute Land is probably not real. Your rainbow transformation upward might not be a good thing."

Wu Yaozu nodded and sighed, "Yes, I know. Bearing rainbow light with the physical body, that technique originally came down from that moon. What comes from there, eventually returns there."

At this moment, Qin Ming's body glowed faintly and felt hot. This was his eighth rebirth taking place. He had started drinking Heavenly Light Liquid back in the dilapidated courtyard. Now, he took out the five-colored bottle and took another large gulp. Instantly, it was as if lightning intertwined within his flesh and blood, and his entire body was bathed in radiant light.

Wu Yaozu's face twitched slightly, saying, "My grandma said this is used for refining spiritual artifacts and rare treasures. Can you really drink it like that?"

"It tastes excellent!" Qin Ming smiled, though his abdomen felt like it was burning, in pain. But the feeling of clearly sensing his physique improving and constantly getting stronger was truly wonderful! He felt genuine joy, quite happy and excited.

"Heavenly Light Liquid... for me, it's an invaluable treasure elixir," Qin Ming said.

The liquid in the five-colored bottle not only contained the spiritual essence that allowed his eighth rebirth but could also push the Heavenly Light energy he had recently cultivated to mastery. The three-colored spiritual flowers, five-colored spiritual branches, and fallen fruits—their mother plant absorbed some Heavenly Light. After this filtration, the spiritual essence was severely diminished, making them only suitable for enhancing Heavenly Light and integrating techniques. Whether in the Thunderfire Alchemy Hall, the Heavenly Light giant pit on Luofu Immortal Mountain, or the five-colored bottle before him, all contained true extraordinary Heavenly Light, considered "potent medicine."

Qin Ming traveled while "digesting" the Heavenly Light Liquid. His internal organs were burning, every inch of his flesh and blood was being purified, his strength was growing, and he was continuously becoming stronger.

"Hiss!" Soon, both their expressions changed slightly. Following the path planned by Grandma Wu, they encountered many ruins along the way, which were surprisingly riddled with ghostly figures.

Next, the two began to run frantically, but soon heard piercing screams that made their heads ache terribly, and the scenery around them seemed to distort.

With a bang, the jade pendant Wu Yaozu wore glowed. The carved divine image was actually Grandma Wu herself, which made Qin Ming stare in shock.

Across the wilderness, large swathes of dark shadows were scorched and ignited, emitting painful screams. However, this area's resentful energy was too heavy. Every time they passed a village, it was full of monsters, howling and pouncing. Qin Ming also took out the cloth woven with exotic gold, infusing it with Heavenly Light energy. Immediately, a great sun appeared, illuminating all directions, burning the place with wailing ghosts and gods.

"There are no ghosts; these are all just resentful energy, malevolent energy, and illusions. We don't need to pay attention to them; just charge forward."

Rubble, ash, and broken walls were everywhere. These were all villages and towns from the edge of the Fourth Absolute Land, all destroyed in the past.

By the end, both were exhausted because the things they encountered grew increasingly sinister. Although they said there were no ghosts, just resentful energy, malevolent energy, and remnants of the past. Yet, later, when they rested on the road, they found a black-dressed woman hanging from an ancient tree, swaying back and forth. She emitted a mental energy field that caused their heads to ache terribly, almost causing them to faint there.

Subsequently, everything they saw along the way was bizarre. Passing a mountain god temple, they both actually had their consciousness leave their bodies and fought a battle with the monster dwelling there. They were exhausted and nearly in danger, finally setting the ancient temple on fire.

This was still the safest path Grandma Wu had planned. If they hadn't taken this path, what else would they have encountered? Both felt their hair stand on end. They were certain they hadn't completely escaped the edge of the Fourth Absolute Land yet; it was still extremely dangerous, and they needed to break out quickly.

The sky was ink-black, and wild grass grew profusely. Skulls and remains could be seen intermittently, half-buried in the mist-shrouded earth.

Wu Yaozu asked, "Brother Ming, is there something on my back? I feel like someone jumped on me, but I can't reach it."

Qin Ming saw nothing, but with emotional resonance, he discovered a ball of black light carrying intense resentment. Without a word, he suppressed it with his Heavenly Light energy, like a great sun. With a sizzle, flames danced, accompanied by a piercing shriek, and the black shadow dissipated.

The next moment, his own neck tightened, feeling like he was suffocating.

"Brother Ming, your neck is black!" Wu Yaozu helped, his internal rainbow light surging forward.

"This old guy is powerful; we're in for another bitter battle!" Qin Ming said. He saw an old man, spewing black smoke, who had wrapped his neck with iron chains.

When they severed the black iron chains, both their spiritual consciousnesses were pulled out of their physical bodies. Fortunately, Wu Yaozu was skilled in this, his internal rainbow light emerging from his body, while Qin Ming's Heavenly Light energy followed, allowing him to carry his consciousness for spiritual travel. The two stubbornly fought the old man to the death.

With a bang, the old man's dark conscious remnant was finally shattered by the two of them.

"Little Wu, could some of these resentful spirits and evil beings be your ancestors?" Qin Ming sat on the ground, panting heavily. This journey had been incredibly difficult.

Wu Yaozu lay on the ground, his chest heaving, utterly exhausted. "Don't even mention it. Right now, I have no ancestors in my eyes, only demons and monsters!"

The two continued their journey. A paper boat swayed gently, drifting through the night sky, making them dare not even breathe. On the boat was a disheveled woman, her resentment terrifyingly strong, and her conscious remnant was like a black sun, making their flesh and blood unbearable, feeling as if they would decay if illuminated further.

The woman glanced at them, noticed the jade pendant Little Wu was wearing, and said, "Descendants of an old friend, then never mind."

The paper boat carried her, drifting slowly away.

"The outside world is too terrifying; I want to go home!" Wu Yaozu exclaimed.

Qin Ming corrected him, saying, "This isn't the outside world. This is the town where your ancestors resided, still on the edge of your Fourth Absolute Land. We haven't left yet!"

They ran quickly, wishing they could instantly escape this area.

Suddenly, instruments played in unison ahead, quite joyful, as if someone was sending off a bride. The two immediately froze. Based on experience, the stranger the event encountered, the more dangerous it was.

"The auspicious hour has arrived, but the groom suddenly died on the way. What should we do?" A weeping sound came from afar.

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu exchanged glances, then turned and ran. This was because the bride in the distant red sedan chair was emitting not black light, nor golden light, but a chilling silver light, stronger than anything they had encountered before. Even from a great distance, the two could not bear it.

Unfortunately, this time they encountered an unfathomable existence. A slender, snow-white hand reached out, aimed at them, and then the two began to fly backward.

"Grandma, open your eyes!" Wu Yaozu quickly took out the jade pendant hanging from his chest. Then he shouted to the bride, "Ancestor, we are family! Look at this pendant, do you recognize it?"

Qin Ming was shocked. This procession was too vast, dense and endless, stretching as far as the eye could see.

Seeing himself about to fly towards the red sedan chair, Wu Yaozu grew anxious and shouted, "We're close relatives! I can't be the groom, I'm a Wu family member!" With a thud, he fell to the ground, gasping for air.

Qin Ming was stunned and shouted, "Family! I'm from the Absolute Land too!"

"We are from the First Absolute Land, just passing through your area," an old man spoke up.

"Why do you have a token on you?" the woman's voice came from inside the red sedan chair.

"I don't!" Qin Ming panicked, because he was falling towards the red sedan chair!
