# Chapter 175: Ancient Secrets

"My master is a person with one soul and two consciousnesses, a phenomenon rare through the ages. His cultivation path was incredibly arduous, yet he possessed great destiny and supreme perseverance, exploring his way forward. In a place like the Buddhist Realm, he forged his own path, integrating both demon and Buddha."

The old monk recounted, his tone calm, a lingering sense of reverence in his eyes.

"He once, by his own might, fought a great battle against the then Buddha Lord, who bore the Mandate of Heaven for the Buddhist Realm. No one knows how he achieved it, but he did. He successfully overturned the previous Buddha Lord, took up the Mandate of Heaven himself, and became the Buddha Lord of that era."

Zhou Tian gasped, *golly*, this guy was too strong. To defeat someone bearing the Mandate of Heaven in the Buddhist Realm... He was no longer a novice; in a grand world like the Ancient Nine Realms, the one who bore the Mandate of Heaven was the strongest, without peer. With the blessing of world power, it was simply impossible to defeat such a person in their home world. Yet, this Wutian was truly too powerful. But how could such a formidable individual be depicted as a half-step Heavenly Venerate with little presence in ancient history?

"Master..." Zhou Tian began.

"No need to call me Master, my Dharma name is Puzhi," the old monk interrupted Zhou Tian.

"Master Puzhi, do you know that Wutian... the old Buddha Lord, is now depicted as a half-step Heavenly Venerate in historical records?" Zhou Tian probed, ready to defend himself if the old monk flared up. However, to his surprise, Puzhi did not get angry; he merely sighed softly.

"I can surmise that the period when Master Wutian ruled must be considered a disgrace in the Buddhist Realm."

"Why?" Zhou Tian was puzzled. What could be objectionable about such a powerful Buddha becoming the Buddha Lord?

"Because my master advocated for eating meat heartily, drinking wine freely, acting as one pleased, and disregarding precepts. You could even see Buddhas preaching while holding children."

"Uh..." A person of true character, indeed. Zhou Tian didn't know how to respond, so he changed the subject. "Then what about this tomb?"

Puzhi's eyes deepened when he heard this question. "Always maintain a heart of reverence. These were my master's last words when he passed away peacefully."

"After serving as Buddha Lord for a thousand years, my master grew bored. He left the Buddhist Realm and began exploring the worlds beyond. He discovered some powerful worlds near the Buddhist Realm, but an invisible barrier prevented his entry. So, he drifted in the void until one day, he found a spatial node, came into contact with the Myriad Worlds, and gained the concept of the Star Realm. But he also encountered a group of people who called themselves Jailers."

"Jailers?!" Zhou Tian was startled. Only people from the Border Prison would call themselves Jailers; no one would impersonate them, nor would anyone dare to.

"They said my master had touched a taboo and intended to imprison him. A great battle then ensued. My master was defeated and fled to this place to pass away, but his opponents did not fare well either; my master took down several Jail Lord-level figures in the struggle." Puzhi's account was concise, many details merely summarized in a single sentence, but Zhou Tian knew it must have been an unimaginably grand battle!

"What about you? How did you survive?" Zhou Tian asked.

"Survive? I died long ago. What you see now is merely a projection from my master's Buddha Kingdom," Puzhi said lightly.

"Projection?" Zhou Tian scanned the old monk from head to toe. His complexion was ruddy, indicating he must have eaten plenty of meat in his life; he looked nothing like a mere projection. "What was your peak strength?"

"Merely a half-step Heavenly Venerate," Puzhi replied humbly.

"..." A half-step Heavenly Venerate, and 'merely' at that. Zhou Tian was speechless.

"Master, you just mentioned your demonic nature. Are you also one of those people with one soul and two consciousnesses?" Zhou Tian recalled this question. Since Puzhi had reached the half-step Heavenly Venerate realm, he must have resolved the issue of conflicting consciousnesses. Zhou Tian wondered if he had any solutions, especially since Saint Devil had come for this very reason. He had to look out for his junior brother, after all.

"I am not. My master's case is rare through the ages. I merely followed him for many years and was infected by his demonic nature," Puzhi answered.

"Alright," Zhou Tian said, a little disappointed. He had thought this old monk was one too.

"Why the disappointment, Benefactor?" Puzhi sensed Zhou Tian's disappointment and asked.

"A junior brother of mine also possesses dual consciousness and is stuck at the Heavenly King realm, unable to advance. I came to the Nirvana ground of old Buddha Lord Wutian specifically to see if there was a solution. Do you happen to know of any method?" Zhou Tian said. There was nothing to hide. This old monk's purpose for finding him was unknown, so this was a good opportunity to ask for guidance. Since the half-step Heavenly Venerate status was apparently false, the relics might not be real either. It would be better to ask a local.

"Oh." A glimmer of light flickered in Puzhi's eyes. He pondered for a moment, then raised a hand to point at the large lotus flower. "You can try there. That is my master's origin treasure. If there is a solution here, it would be there, apart from the Buddha Kingdom. However, the Buddha Kingdom is not yet ready to open."

It was still that large lotus flower, aligning with his own objective. He just wasn't sure if Saint Devil would go there. After pondering for a moment, Zhou Tian spoke, "Many thanks, Master. If nothing else, I'll be on my way."

"Mm, please yourself, Benefactor," Puzhi nodded.

A moment later, Puzhi asked curiously, "Benefactor, why are you still not leaving?"

Zhou Tian awkwardly rubbed his nose. "Master, are you truly finished?" He was a bit skeptical. Could this old man truly be here just to answer his questions? It seemed too fake; just when he was unfamiliar with the place, a 'tour guide' popped up.

"There is indeed one more matter." Puzhi seemed to recall something. He once again took out the kasaya and handed it to Zhou Tian, saying, "Benefactor, individuality and abnormality are but a single thought apart."

"..." "Many thanks, Master." Zhou Tian awkwardly took the kasaya and put it on. This old monk truly seemed to bear no ill will, so he might as well wear it. "Master, I'm really leaving now."

"Farewell, Benefactor," Puzhi said, hands clasped together.

Zhou Tian no longer hesitated, flashing away. Puzhi stood rooted to the spot for a long time, seemingly deep in thought.

"Why didn't you look into his secrets? I clearly devoured him yesterday. Why did you suddenly feel compassion? Haven't you killed enough people?" A wisp of black mist emanated from Puzhi's body, whispering in his ear.

"You are merely my demonic nature; do not presume to control me." Puzhi's expression darkened. Buddhist light permeated the area, chanting sounds arose, and the black mist let out a shriek before dissipating into the air.

Puzhi looked at the Buddha phantom and let out a long sigh, saying, "Master, have you returned?"
