# Chapter 380: All Are Beasts

If this were three days ago, he might have felt some apprehension, but now...

He was already at the Land Immortal Realm, and he wanted to test his strength!

The Ten Extremes True Qi erupted violently, and the赤golden (crimson-gold) radiance shot straight into the heavens like an enraged dragon, dyeing the entire sky a brilliant gold-red.

The group of Primordial Origin Sect disciples seemed to be struck by an invisible giant hammer, stumbling back several steps, their faces a mixture of shock and doubt.

The scar-faced leader's pupils constricted violently, his knuckles turning white as he gripped the jade talisman at his waist.

How could a martial artist from this small world possess such terrifying true qi that made even them tremble?

"Something's wrong!" someone in the team shouted in alarm. "The amount of true qi... it's probably equal to the combined total of a dozen or so fellow disciples at the peak of the Qi Condensation stage!"

Another disciple had cold sweat beading on his forehead, his gaze turning somewhat gloomy.

"Interesting... With that amount of true qi, they could drown us to death."

"This definitely isn't someone from this world. Perhaps it's a reincarnated cultivator from the Taihua Spirit Void Realm who secretly slipped in..."

The scar-faced man swept a sinister gaze over his fellow disciples, secretly forming a hand seal for an evasion technique.

In the law-of-the-jungle Primordial Origin Sect, killing fellow disciples was more common than eating or drinking. As long as it wasn't done openly, anything was permissible, let alone inside a small world.

The round-faced disciple's expression was extremely unsightly, and he had a vague guess in his mind.

"You're not a Ninth Stage Martial Artist."

Xu Yunfan didn't answer. He simply slowly raised his right hand and drew the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel.

The moment the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel left its sheath, thanks to the vast infusion of Ten Extremes True Qi, the power of this seventh-grade divine weapon fully revived. The surrounding heaven and earth suddenly darkened, with faint crimson flames rising.

The nine dragon patterns on the cudgel lit up one after another. The bluestone beneath Xu Yunfan's feet melted into a glassy state under the high temperature, and the vegetation within a ten-zhang radius instantly carbonized.

This divine weapon forged from extraterrestrial meteoric iron now exuded the unique crimson-gold radiance of the Land Immortal Realm.

"Retreat first!"

The scar-faced man suddenly roared, flinging three gray-green talismans from his sleeves.

The paper talismans self-ignited in the air, transforming into three chain-like strands of dark blue true energy that shot toward Xu Yunfan.

The other disciples reacted with extreme speed; the scar-faced man had barely opened his mouth before everyone was already moving.

The round-faced cultivator formed a hand seal, his figure blurring into a faint green afterimage. The female cultivator on the left stepped into the Seven Star Step, the soles of her shoes bursting with silver light. The short disciple on the far right was even more ruthless, shoving a companion toward Xu Yunfan's direction.

The scar-faced man caught this out of the corner of his eye and couldn't help but curse inwardly, *What a beast.*

In the Primordial Origin Sect, where the law of the jungle reigns, what fellowship could there be between fellow disciples?

Rather than working together while constantly fearing a backstab from others, it was better to be the first to pull back and retreat.

As long as he was one step faster than the others, disaster wouldn't catch him!

This person couldn't be faced head-on; another method was needed to deal with him slowly.

*Sizzle!*

The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel swept across, and the three dark blue chains melted like snow meeting boiling oil.

Wherever the cudgel shadow passed, the true energy chains shattered inch by inch. The Ten Extremes True Qi within Xu Yunfan surged wildly, using a true qi quantity thirty times greater to forcibly cancel out the suppression from the Qi Condensation stage's true essence.

The disciple who had been pushed over didn't even have time to scream. His protective true essence shattered like an eggshell. As the cudgel tip swept past his neck, his head flew off, his eyes still wide with shock.

*Boom!*

The second cudgel strike slammed into the ground, and nine magma-like waves of fire erupted in a fan shape.

This was the "Earth Dragon's Turn" from the Eight Wastes Dragon Fall Cudgel Technique. Xu Yunfan deliberately used his Ten Extremes True Qi to resonate with the underground vein.

The scar-faced man, who was in the middle of forming a seal, suddenly stumbled. The ground beneath his feet had become undulating like ocean waves, instantly disrupting his evasion technique hand seal.

"Void Piercer!"

Xu Yunfan grabbed the Void Piercer Cloud-Piercing Bow slung across his body.

The sound of the bowstring trembling was like a dragon's roar. Five arrows condensed from Ten Extremes True Qi simultaneously locked onto five fleeing figures.

This Void Piercer Cloud-Piercing Bow, when paired with the Void Piercer Cloud-Piercing Arrow Technique at full mastery, achieved the "Five Stars in a Row." The moment the arrows left the string, they caused sonic booms, leaving behind long-lasting crimson-gold trails.

*Pfft!*

The slowest short disciple's back exploded with a bowl-sized bloody hole.

The arrow pierced through his chest without losing momentum, pinning the female cultivator's leg to the cliff wall.

The true essence within these two bodies automatically protected their masters, forming a green light membrane at the wound. However, the Ten Extremes True Qi was like a parasite, continuously eroding them. Although their true essence quickly dispelled the true qi, Xu Yunfan didn't give them any chance to heal. The third arrow shot straight through the female cultivator's brow.

"Form the Three Talismans Formation! If we keep running, we'll all die. This guy is unreasonable. Even if he broke through the Ninth Stage shackles, it's impossible for him to be this strong... Perhaps he obtained the things left behind by the Divine Martial True Person in the Divine Martial World!"

The scar-faced man suddenly bit the tip of his tongue, spraying a blood mist that formed a strange rune in the air.

Three of the remaining seven immediately responded, each summoning their lifebound magical artifact.

A snake-shaped short sword, an ancient bronze mirror, a string of black jade prayer beads.

The three artifacts resonated with the blood talisman, instantly撑起 (propping up) a dark red, triangular pyramid-shaped barrier. This was the "Blood Fiend Shared Destruction Array" that the outer disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect used to save their lives, sacrificing burning lifeblood to gain extremely powerful defense.

Xu Yunfan sneered, suddenly letting go of the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel.

The cudgel body划出 (drew) nine crimson-gold trajectories in the air.

Each cudgel shadow contained the power of Mountain Soul, like nine mountain shadows bombarding the barrier one after another.

When the final cudgel force slammed down, his right hand suddenly clenched.

"Break!"

The terror of the Land Immortal Realm was fully displayed here, or rather, the terrifying strength Xu Yunfan displayed as a Land Immortal.

The defensive array of the formation was actually shattered by these few strikes.

A cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel in mid-air trembled violently, the crimson-gold patterns on its body suddenly glowing brightly, as if magma were surging within.

The next instant, he relaxed his five fingers, and the entire cudgel, like a meteor, smashed toward the core of the Three Talismans Formation. Then...

"Explode!"

A world-shaking explosion rang out. The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel shattered violently at the center of the array. The violent crimson-gold true qi surged out like a volcanic eruption.

Cudgel fragments, carrying scorching true flames, transformed into countless fire meteors shooting out in all directions. Each fragment contained immense force, tearing the foundation of the array, constructed by the three artifacts, into pieces!

*Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!*

The three maintaining the formation were struck as if by lightning. Their protective true essence instantly shattered, and blood spurted from all seven orifices.

However, what made them even more terrified was that the explosive true essence, which should have dissipated, was actually held in mid-air by a terrifying suction force!

Xu Yunfan spread his arms wide, and the Ten Extremes True Qi opened up like an invisible giant net, forcibly constraining the scattered true essence.

The dissipated energy was pulled into hundreds of fine golden threads, writhing like living creatures, and finally, like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, frantically poured into the major acupoints around his body.

The moment those foreign true essences flowed into his meridians, Xu Yunfan's brow furrowed sharply.

These true essences not only couldn't be assimilated by the Ten Extremes True Qi, but instead, like parasites, eroded his flesh and blood!

Each strand of foreign true essence carried a completely different characteristic.
