# Chapter 43: Experiment  

Outside Zhongdu City, Li Shiming stood at the foot of a small hill.  

He had come to test his spells. While minor spells like the 'Golden Metal Art' with subtle spiritual fluctuations could be used within Zhongdu without issue, casting 'Fireball Art' was absolutely forbidden.  

Gu Jia was stationed in Zhongdu to maintain peace, and cultivators were not allowed to cause disturbances within the city's boundaries. Although Li Shiming had some rapport with Gu Jia, he wouldn’t act recklessly because of it.  

Moreover, despite Zhongdu’s size, there was no suitable place for him to properly test the 'Light Body Art.'  

A glow of spiritual energy flickered at his fingertips as he traced the runes for the 'Light Body Art.' The intent he had long since grasped merged seamlessly with the runes.  

Using a 'Primary Light Body Talisman' and casting the 'Light Body Art' himself were two entirely different experiences. The talisman was like a solidified version of the spell’s runes, requiring only a small amount of spiritual energy to activate.  

Casting the spell, however, required him to channel his own spiritual energy to form the runes.  

Activating the talisman took barely a breath, but casting the spell depended entirely on how quickly he could draw the runes.  

As Li Shiming completed the 'Light Body Art,' a faint green glow enveloped his legs. He estimated that about a tenth of his spiritual energy had been consumed.  

The energy cost was manageable, but the casting time—over five seconds—was far too slow.  

This was his first true attempt at casting the spell, and he had deliberately slowed the process. With practice, he believed he could reduce the casting time to under two seconds, perhaps even faster.  

Pushing off with his feet, he sprinted toward the hilltop.  

As he ran, he noticed a distinct difference in speed. The 'Primary Light Body Talisman' had granted him a speed of roughly 100 kilometers per hour, but his self-cast 'Light Body Art' pushed him to 120 kilometers per hour. That 20% increase could be crucial in a chase.  

"Why is there such a difference?" he murmured to himself at the summit.  

His cultivation was only at the second level of Qi Refining. The talisman’s effect might be tied to his realm, but his strength hadn’t changed in the few days since he last used it.  

"Could it be the intent?" he wondered aloud.  

He was certain his understanding of the 'Light Body Art' differed from other cultivators.  

His intent was shaped by the sensation of speeding in an open-top sports car, an experience IBMz15 had simulated so vividly that it felt real, resonating with the spell.  

But this world had no concept of sports cars. Such an intent shouldn’t exist here.  

"Are there multiple possible intents for a single spell?" he pondered.  

These were questions typically answered only after joining a sect or finding a master.  

Yet, with IBMz15’s assistance, he could simulate countless scenarios—videos, images, movie clips, animations, or even entirely imagined environments—all rendered with near-perfect realism thanks to the supercomputer’s 190 CPUs.  

He pulled up a scene of a galloping racehorse, one of the fastest in his past life, and immersed himself in the rider’s perspective.  

As he did, the spiritual energy at his fingertips resonated with the 'Light Body Art' runes. Without hesitation, he cast the spell again, this time with the new intent.  

The green glow around his legs shifted subtly.  

Descending the hill, he quickly realized that while the energy cost remained the same, his speed had dropped to match the talisman’s effect.  

Perhaps this was the true intent of the 'Light Body Art' in this world, while the sports car imagery was an anomaly.  

With four-fifths of his spiritual energy remaining, he moved on to test the 'Fireball Art.'  

This intent was simpler—any explosive scenario would suffice. As soon as he immersed himself in the sensation, the runes resonated.  

A small fireball shot forth.  

Li Shiming sensed he could slightly adjust its trajectory, but his control was limited. Likely due to his low cultivation level—second-stage Qi Refining was insufficient for precise manipulation.  

The fireball struck a tree trunk thirty meters away, exploding on impact and snapping the bowl-thick wood in half.  

"This is basically a grenade," he mused, comparing its power to modern weaponry.  

Inspecting the broken trunk, he noticed lingering red spiritual energy burning downward from the impact point. The 'Fireball Art' wasn’t just explosive—it also inflicted sustained damage.  

Compared to the 'Golden Metal Art,' the fireball had greater destructive power and a wider area of effect. The former left a small puncture, while the latter caused an explosion.  

Like the 'Light Body Art,' the 'Fireball Art' consumed about a tenth of his spiritual energy. He suspected this might be tied to his spiritual roots, though without certainty about his own aptitude, it remained speculation.  

Mission accomplished, he activated the 'Light Body Art' once more and turned back toward Zhongdu.  

As he ran, a copper coin hovered above his palm—proof of his mastery over the 'Telekinesis Art.'  

Among all the spells he had learned, this one had been as straightforward as the others. Its intent—visualizing an invisible hand—was simple to grasp.  

Yet, for now, 'Telekinesis Art' was the least useful. It could only manipulate objects weighing about ten pounds, insufficient even to wield a low-grade flying sword. At best, it served as an extended hand, allowing him to fetch small items within a five-meter radius without moving.  

On the bright side, once cast, the spell lasted a long time. Beyond the initial energy cost, maintaining it depended on the object’s size and how often it was moved.  

With these spells at his disposal, Li Shiming finally felt like a true cultivator.
