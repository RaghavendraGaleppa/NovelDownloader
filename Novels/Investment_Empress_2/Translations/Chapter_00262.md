# Chapter 262: Yanri Golden Peng, I Must Kowtow in Person!

The Peng Clan territory is located relatively close to the Black Water Marsh.

Consequently, they were the first to receive the news.

"Recently, due to the gathering of the Water Tribe in the Black Water Marsh, a large amount of water vapor has condensed. The heavy rain the day before yesterday caused multiple Peng collision accidents."

"In the coming days, there is still a possibility of heavy to moderate rain. Please advise the Ninth Rank Peng Demons to avoid taking flight as much as possible, Eighth Rank Peng Demons may fly at their discretion, and Seventh Rank and above Peng Demons are permitted to fly..."

"The cause of the heavy rain has been identified: the Ming蛟 (Ming蛟) Clan has recently given birth to a pure-blood Heavenly Flood Dragon. Its bloodline power is formidable, and its physique is terrifying, with a suspected possibility of ancestral True Dragon bloodline..."

"—Reporting for the Golden Peng Weather."

In the Peng Clan territory, the Cloud Selection was also underway.

The clouds in the sky had been reshaped by the great Peng Demons into various cloud paths, and the participating avian clans were racing through them at lightning speed.

However, due to the heavy rain, multiple Peng crashes had occurred recently on the cloud paths.

"The Ming蛟 Clan is really bullying birds too much!"

"Wu Mo? What kind of outsider Flood Dragon is this? Could it be some old Flood Dragon pretending to be a young one by painting itself green to participate?"

"Indeed, they have done such things before."

The avian clans were filled with righteous indignation.

Suddenly, a sigh came from the side:

"Wu Mo is indeed from outside the Southern Frontier."

"Oh? How do you know that?"

The avian clans looked in the direction of the voice.

Could the hired water军 (water troops) of the Ming蛟 Clan have infiltrated the Peng Clan territory?

"Because I was the one who sent him to the Black Water Marsh."

The bald Peng Demon pointed to the two large lumps piled up on his head, speaking with absolute certainty.

"......"

The Peng Clan members looked on with some disbelief.

Although the bald Peng Demon looked so miserable, he was, after all, at the peak of the Seventh Rank, and stepping into the Sixth Rank was not an issue; becoming a Fifth Rank great demon was also possible.

Just moments ago, he had completed the cloud path race in one minute and twenty-eight seconds.

Yet he was beaten so badly by Wu Mo?

"So, it's also true that he smashed one of Xiangliu's Young Clan Leader's heads?"

"Mm... he probably held back when he was beating me that day."

"The Ming蛟 Clan's Wu Mo, I wonder how he compares to our clan's Zhiduoluo."

*Whoosh—*

Just as the avian clans were discussing, a figure shot across the sky.

His speed was so fast that it even created a mushroom-shaped cloud ring, tearing through the horizon and dispersing the dark clouds, passing through the cloud path in an instant.

"One minute! The record for Seventh Rank avian clans has been broken again!"

The figure was a youth with a dark complexion, clad in golden armor, and with a pair of wings on his back. He had a complete human form but retained some avian characteristics.

Especially his pair of wings, which, like his eyes and hair, were a light golden color.

He looked down upon the other avian clans, his gaze cold and devoid of emotion.

Half-Peng, Zhiduoluo.

"Wu Mo?"

"Is he the one who caused trouble in the Black Water Marsh, disrupting the Church's arrangements and costing me the incense power of one town?"

.......

The Azure Luan Clan territory.

At this moment, in the largest tree hollow amidst the blue-leafed forest.

The young Luans of the Azure Luan Clan had all gathered here.

Some looked at Shang Qinqing on the stage with serious expressions, while others looked on with curiosity and anticipation.

*Bang—*

Shang Qinqing slammed the gavel onto the table.

"It is said that the Heavenly Flood Dragon of the Ming蛟 Clan had a tragic background. He was a Flood Dragon who struggled to survive in the human lands from a young age, with an injured father, a frail mother, a not-so-bright younger brother, and a broken him..."

"His name is Wu~~~Mo!"

Hmm...

Since many Azure Luans cannot speak and find it difficult to communicate with the outside world, over time, it is easy for problems to arise with their Dao hearts.

The Clan Leader would regularly hold gatherings here to talk about major events or rumors from the Southern Frontier.

Commonly known as 'preaching the Dao.'

After saying this, Shang Qinqing glanced to the side and saw a young woman not far away pouring tea on a big-headed doll.

She was human.

However, sitting among the Azure Luans, who were known for being aloof and reticent, she seemed to fit in perfectly.

"Wu... Mo?"

Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed slightly as she softly murmured this name.

In her memories from her previous life, the Ming蛟 Clan did not have a genius named Wu Mo.

But she couldn't possibly misremember this name...

"Yet, he traveled thousands of miles to the Southern Frontier and made a stunning debut at the Water Tribe selection! Summoning unprecedented storms!"

"Who would have thought that the Xiangliu Young Clan Leader would act unchivalrously, attempting to bully the young with his seniority..."

The Azure Luans, who were listening intently, were highly immersed.

The avian clans all dislike rain.

But compared to the Ming蛟, the Xiangliu Clan is even more讨厌 (disliked).

After all, the former only makes the air more humid and increases rainfall, while the latter causes great harm to the environment of the Southern Frontier. Wherever they pass, vegetation no longer grows, and even the clearest water sources turn into toxic sewage.

"Who knew that Wu Mo not only possessed a formidable physical body but had also practiced martial arts in the human lands!"

"With a flick of his sleeve, he shattered one of the Xiangliu Young Clan Leader's heads, and then, completely ignoring the martial principle of 'stopping after a point,' he unleashed a barrage of attacks like a storm!"

"It can be seen that although he learned martial arts, he did not learn martial virtue..."

The sound of wings clapping together came from below.

After the birds finished applauding, they all cast subtle glances toward Ying Bing.

The emergence of a genius in the Ming蛟 Clan was not good news for them, as it meant another strong competitor for the Celestial Jade.

Moreover, Wu Mo, just like the Divine Maiden, had shattered one of the Xiangliu Young Clan Leader's heads.

But upon seeing the girl sitting there, the birds couldn't help but feel their worries were unnecessary.

She was too dazzling.

Shang Qinqing sat down opposite Ying Bing and asked with a smile:

"The Water Tribe and our avian clans have always been at odds. What do you think, do you have any confidence?"

"Mm."

"As expected of you. But you haven't even seen that opponent yet."

"......"

Ying Bing's jade-like face did not show any solemnity; instead, there was a hint of indescribable complexity amidst her contemplation.

Shang Qinqing was slightly taken aback, then said:

"What are you thinking? Although both have 'Mo' in their names, Ming蛟 and humans are still quite different."

"I don't know."

Ying Bing stared at the big-headed doll, but unfortunately, the big-headed doll couldn't tell her the answer.

What method could turn a person into something indistinguishable from a Ming蛟?

And still stand out in the Water Tribe selection?

It seems somewhat unbelievable...

But if it happened to him, it seemed reasonable no matter how unexpected.

"Oh, I get it. If it's not him, then it's nothing to worry about."

"If it's him, then there's no need to fight..."

Shang Qinqing suddenly had a sudden realization, then she said seriously:

"In a couple of days, I will personally take you to the Suspended Temple."

"Why?"

"I must kowtow in person!"

"....."
