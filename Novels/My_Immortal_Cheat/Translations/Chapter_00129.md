# Chapter 129: Saint-Devil Brother

"No." Zhou Tian shook his head honestly.

"There's no harm in telling you. In the Nine Provinces, among my generation and even the older generations, it's not a great secret," Saint-Devil said. "Since childhood, I've had a dual soul, unable to cultivate. My two personalities couldn't meet and constantly vied for control of my body, until I received the inheritance of an ancient Buddha Realm mighty figure."

Saint-Devil's tone was calm. Although he was right in front of Zhou Tian, his voice seemed to come from beyond the heavens. "Luo Tian Temple is merely a lineage passed down from the ancient Buddha Realm, albeit the strongest one. However, this particular Buddha had no relation to them. But since it was the inheritance of a mighty figure from the Buddha Realm, they naturally wanted to learn more about it. That's why I've had several encounters with them..." Saint-Devil didn't elaborate on this, but it was likely not a pleasant interaction. After all, he was a self-made man with no background, while Luo Tian Temple was one of the super-powers in the Nine Provinces. The two were simply incomparable.

Zhou Tian nodded. Such powerful individuals, capable of growing to this extent, undoubtedly possessed legendary growth experiences.

"You seem to be trying to merge your two personalities?" Zhou Tian recalled the bizarre state Saint-Devil had exhibited during their fight.

"That's right. Only by merging my two personalities can I break through to the Dao Lord realm. This is a well-known fact." The phantom Buddha figure behind Saint-Devil accelerated its transformation. Two distinctly different phenomena also manifested around him: one side shone like paradise, the other was dark like hell.

"And after they merge, will you still be you?" Zhou Tian tried asking, a contemplative look in his eyes.

"My soul is me, my body is me. Naturally, I will still be me." Saint-Devil opened his eyes, and all phenomena around him dissipated. He frowned slightly, unsure why Zhou Tian was asking this.

"But after the merger, which personality will dominate? Will it be your current self, your other personality, or a new personality formed from the fusion of both?" Zhou Tian said, "This Saint-Devil, for someone with a split personality, is truly formidable. To actually 'cure' himself using this method... Normally, a person with a split personality would have a dominant one, but looking at Saint-Devil, his two personalities seem to have no main or subordinate roles."

"You don't need to worry about that question for me." Saint-Devil frowned slightly. His Dao Heart was incredibly firm; it was impossible for Zhou Tian's words to shake him.

"Alright, alright." Zhou Tian shrugged. He had only asked out of curiosity, not expecting his few words to make Saint-Devil's two personalities tear each other apart.

"If the people of the Nine Provinces and those from the Ancient God Realm start fighting, who will you help?" Zhou Tian changed the topic. This was practically a foregone conclusion. Based solely on the intelligence Zhou Tian had gathered so far, the gods of the God Realm had paid a significant price and would certainly not let things end peacefully.

Saint-Devil's eyelids drooped. After a moment, as if deep in thought, he spoke: "I was born in the Nine Provinces. No matter what, I will not side with the God Realm."

"Then why are you helping them now?" Zhou Tian asked. It was clear that the ones who had made a deal with Saint-Devil were from the God Realm. He didn't believe Saint-Devil couldn't see that.

"The path of cultivation cannot be stopped. I have my reasons."

Zhou Tian was speechless. Saint-Devil always had his reasons, no matter what.

"Why are you talking so much, little brat? Ask one more question, and I'll toss one of your two friends overboard!" Saint-Devil threatened, seeing Zhou Tian about to speak again.

Zhou Tian was choked up. His lips moved, but he ultimately said nothing. *I won't stoop to your level*, Zhou Tian secretly comforted himself.

The massive body of the Nine-tailed Phoenix flew across the sky above the God-Forsaken Land, moving at extreme speed. Each flap of its wings tore open vast swathes of space, and the tremendous air currents caused great devastation to the land below. Wherever it passed, all fierce beasts fell silent, petrified with fear, cowering like turtles.

Two days passed in a flash. The land beneath the Nine-tailed Phoenix was no longer a desolate, barren plain but showed signs of cities.

"Whoosh!" A sword light descended from the heavens, like the Milky Way pouring down, slicing through half the sky. Countless stars appeared and vanished. Just as it was about to strike the Nine-tailed Phoenix, the phoenix's tail feathers glowed, and a vibrant, multicolored shield appeared, blocking the sword light.

A figure appeared in the void, holding a long sword, clad in a gray Daoist robe. The sword qi from earlier was precisely what he had unleashed.

"Who dares to be so presumptuous?!" He sharply rebuked, his voice resounding across the sky like thunder. A divine beast like the Nine-tailed Phoenix was clearly not a creature of the God-Forsaken Land, meaning someone must be directing it.

Inside the palace within the phoenix's belly, Saint-Devil, who had been sitting cross-legged on a chair, suddenly opened his eyes and spoke to the bored Zhou Tian: "We've arrived."

Zhou Tian nearly leaped from his chair upon hearing this; these past two days had bored him to death.

Saint-Devil said no more. With a wave of his hand, both their figures vanished from their spot, reappearing directly on top of the phoenix's head.

Seeing the Daoist-robed figure standing in the void, he calmly spoke: "Someone from the Dao Alliance? Which lineage are you from? Perhaps your master and I even have some acquaintance."

The man heard this and felt somewhat unable to gauge the true strength of the person before him. However, thinking of the colossal power backing him, he couldn't let his imposing aura weaken. He immediately shouted: "And who are you, daring to act so presumptuously in this place?!"

A smile appeared on Saint-Devil's face. "I'm asking you a question. Didn't you hear me clearly?!"

An invisible wave emanated. Without Saint-Devil making any visible move, the man was instantly sent flying backward, spitting out large amounts of blood. Shimmering, crimson blood rained down everywhere. Where the drops landed on the ground, emerald green sprouts shot up.

"A mere Great Emperor dares to speak to me like that," Saint-Devil said with disdain, not taking the opponent's identity seriously at all.

Zhou Tian looked at the figure flying backward, then at Saint-Devil, and then at himself. *Brother Saint-Devil is really giving me face! This means my status in his eyes is even higher than that of a Great Emperor.*

Saint-Devil continued his display of power, releasing an overwhelming aura that shone like a magnificent blazing sun and resembled a demonic mountain suppressing the vast heavens and earth. "An old friend has arrived. Won't a few of the Nine Provinces' experts come out to greet me?"

Instantly, three figures appeared before Saint-Devil. Three middle-aged men: one clad in armor, one draped in a Daoist robe, and one wearing a feather crown. All of them exuded an overwhelming aura, no weaker than Saint-Devil's. In fact, the armored middle-aged man in the center subtly suppressed Saint-Devil.

Although three individuals of similar cultivation appeared, Saint-Devil showed no signs of worry. Instead, his smile became even more audacious. "I didn't expect that only a few of you from the Nine Provinces would actually come. Oh, wait, there are also a few whose auras are uneven. It seems they've suffered heavy injuries." His tone suggested he had anticipated that the Nine Provinces didn't have many top experts available.

Zhou Tian suddenly understood. No wonder Saint-Devil dared to come; he knew there was currently no one here who could crush him.
