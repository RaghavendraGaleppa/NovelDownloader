# Chapter 51: The Infinite Sword Lord - Dou Changsheng!

The next day.

Dou Changsheng's eyes were bloodshot.  

Having stayed awake all night, weariness marked his face, yet his spirits remained high.  

He sat polishing his Hero's Sword, waiting quietly.  

Today was the day the Martial Tower would update the Human Ranking. Countless people across the world were eagerly anticipating it, especially those martial artists striving to break into the ranking. They waited impatiently for its release to see the latest standings.  

Dou Changsheng was no exception—a man of worldly desires.  

Even though he already knew his position, he still wanted to see the Human Ranking as soon as possible.  

Across the four nations, the grasslands, and the smaller states, the number of martial artists was beyond count. To achieve even minor fame in one's locality was no small feat, and to be renowned across an entire province marked one as a true genius.  

But to be listed on the Human Ranking? That meant instant fame across the world.  

One's name would spread through the four nations, the grasslands, and every corner of the land.  

Truly, overnight fame that everyone would know.  

And with fame came immense benefits—power and wealth, all rolled into one.  

This ranking would ensure that the name "Dou Changsheng" would be known in Western Qin, Eastern Qi, Northern Jin, Southern Chen, the grasslands, the State of Lu, Dali, the Western Regions, Liaodong, and the polar regions.  

From then on, wherever he traveled, he would never have to worry about lodging.  

Local magnates would eagerly invite him to banquets, and when he departed, they would even provide him with travel funds.  

Just by virtue of his name, he could journey anywhere in the world.  

And that was just the superficial benefit.  

The Human Ranking held deeper significance.  

The Martial Tower's Heaven, Earth, and Human Rankings were not merely about vanity.  

Some sought fame, others sought profit, and some remained indifferent.  

But for those who truly aspired to martial excellence, the Human Ranking was an inevitable pursuit.  

Once listed, one could join the Jixia Academy in the State of Lu, becoming a student who could listen to the teachings of grandmasters and study its vast collection of martial texts.  

In the Eastern Sea lay the three immortal isles—Penglai, Yingzhou, and Fangzhang—which opened once every ten years, accessible only to those on the Human Ranking.  

And there were countless other benefits, each cycle offering something different, all dependent on fate.  

But even these advantages alone demonstrated the ranking's importance—each one an opportunity, a stroke of destiny.  

Dou Changsheng had realized at first glance that the Martial Tower was this world's grand intermediary, integrating resources from all sides to construct the Three Rankings.  

By now, the Martial Tower's Heaven, Earth, and Human Rankings had become an institution, their authority irreplaceable.  

Once listed, one could ride the wave of these benefits.  

Cultivation would grow smoother, momentum would build, and the strong would only grow stronger while the weak fell further behind.  

No matter the world, reality was always this cruel.  

After what felt like an eternity, hurried footsteps echoed as Ma Liren rushed in, holding a thick copy of the latest Human Ranking.  

"Hero Dou!" he called out loudly from a distance. "It's here! The newest Human Ranking! Delivered by express courier—no one else has seen it yet!"  

Dou Changsheng glanced at Old Ma, satisfied with the man's service. As expected of the Empress's trusted aide—he knew how to cater to people.  

Who knew if he had peeked? With the abilities of a Divine Marvel grandmaster, one could easily memorize the contents while walking briskly. But Old Ma's words were still pleasing to hear.  

Without ceremony, Dou Changsheng took the ranking.  

He skipped the rest, flipping straight to the seventy-ninth spot, where he found what he sought.  

The Human Ranking was entirely text-based, lacking portraits—a definite flaw. Perhaps he could write to the Martial Tower later, suggesting they train skilled artists to include illustrations. With just names and deeds, what if people in other regions failed to recognize him—no, failed to recognize Human Ranking experts and ended up offending them?  

Having portraits would prevent so many unnecessary conflicts and grudges.  

**Human Ranking, Seventy-Ninth—The Infinite Sword Lord, Dou Changsheng!**  

His fingers unconsciously traced the words on the page, as if caressing a maiden's skin, unable to tear himself away.  

At last, he had shed that wretched title, "Gentleman Sword."  

Every time he heard it, he felt a chill down below.  

---  

Meanwhile, in Northern Yang, within a grand estate...  

Wang Chongguang reclined in a wide chair, his loose robes parted to reveal dark, gleaming skin that shimmered faintly, as if coated in oil.  

A copy of the Human Ranking lay in his grasp, his knuckles jutting out grotesquely like the claws of a demon.  

**Eighteen years old.**  

**Five Energies Converging, Innate True Realm.**  

Wang Chongguang snorted coldly, venting his displeasure.  

He had always despised those who debuted on the ranking with such high positions.  

In his generation, there had been one like that—Chen Baihe, the Fire Cloud True Man, now an Earth Ranking grandmaster.  

The memory of that man's condescending gaze still haunted him.  

But compared to this Dou Changsheng, Chen Baihe was nothing.  

Suppressing his emotions, Wang Chongguang reminded himself that such prodigies belonged to a different world. There was no need to flatter them, nor was there any point in provoking them.  

Still, he read through Dou Changsheng's achievements.  

As a martial artist, ignoring the Three Rankings was a sure path to stagnation.  

These lists cataloged all the people and factions one should never cross.  

**Debuted in Jun County, escorting military pay—slaying Wang Xiong with a single swordstroke, breaking through a hundred cavalry head-on.**  

**Rescued the Black Eagle Venerable, forcing an Innate True Realm expert to retreat at Chen Family Fort, leaving an Earth Ranking grandmaster helpless.**  

**Twice entered Sword Gate Pass, renowned for his boundless righteousness and peerless virtue.**  

**At the Battle of Qingyang Peak, he single-handedly dominated the field—dragons do not mingle with snakes.**  

**That same night, exposed Qingyang Daoist's conspiracy, obtained the Qingyang Secret Arts, and became the successor of the Three Yang Divine Lord.**  

**Escorted the deposed Northern Yang King back to his fief, then slew Bloodhand Jin Sanming (Human Ranking Seventy-Ninth) with a single swordstroke.**  

**Summary:** *The "Infinite" in his title refers to his mastery of the Infinite Sword Sect's techniques, as well as his boundless compassion and immeasurable power. "Sword Lord" signifies his peerless swordsmanship, noble character, and flawless virtue—radiant and pure as jade.*  

**Evaluation:** *Peerless in righteousness, unfathomably profound.*  

**Anonymous Earth Ranking Grandmaster:** *"Dou Changsheng will undoubtedly claim the Human Ranking's top spot, dominating the martial world with his sword. The next decade belongs to him."*  

**Martial World Gossip:** *"Rumors from the north claim that Dou Changsheng's depths are unknowable. Just when you think you've seen his limits, he delivers yet another staggering surprise."*  

With a loud *smack*, Wang Chongguang hurled the ranking to the ground.  

"The Wang Clan of Xiangzhou has no shame—bribing the Martial Tower now?"  

But then his eyes narrowed.  

*The Qingyang Secret Arts... the Revitalizing Mystic Water...*  

This could be an opportunity.
