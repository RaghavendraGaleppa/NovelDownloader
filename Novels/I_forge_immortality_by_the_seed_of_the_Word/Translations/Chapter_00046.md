# Chapter 46: These Talismans Were All Made By Me

At the center of the grand hall.

Senior Brother Ding's eyes widened in shock, a wave of deep regret surging uncontrollably in his heart.

He never expected that a momentary lapse in attention would allow this beast to break free from his restraint.

What consequences would a Black Tiger Demon—one he could barely match even after exhausting all his trump cards—bring when charging toward junior brothers and sisters who were only at the initial Qi Refining stage?

The scene was too horrific to imagine!

Senior Brother Ding cast aside all distracting thoughts, forcibly squeezed out every last drop of spiritual energy from his dantian, and channeled it into his magic weapon as he pursued with all his might.

If he could save even one, it would be worth it!

Yet in the next moment.

The miserable sight of the Black Tiger Demon being blasted away by what looked like a miniature sun suddenly appeared before his eyes.

Perfect opportunity!

Without time to ponder his astonishment, Senior Brother Ding roared and immediately swallowed a pill. The spiritual energy in his dantian erupted in full force, pouring into his emerald-green bamboo staff.

In an instant.

The intricate Daoist patterns on the bamboo staff lit up section by section, exuding an aura as heavy as a mountain.

Everything in the hall seemed to freeze in that moment.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The staff descended with an immeasurable, overwhelming force, striking the Black Tiger Demon's forehead three times in rapid succession.

In the blink of an eye, the giant tiger's lantern-like eyes rolled back, and scarlet blood gushed from all seven orifices, transforming into misty sprays of crimson.

Thud!

The massive body of the black tiger crashed heavily onto the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.

Its aura rapidly weakened.

Finally, with stubborn defiance, the tiger lifted its head and glared hatefully at Zhang Jing not far away. "You ambushed me! Utterly dishonorable! Despicable and shameless! I curse you—"

Before it could finish, its breath ceased.

The vast hall fell into silence.

Tap, tap—

Senior Brother Ding stepped over the tiger's corpse and slowly approached Zhang Jing, looking at him with a complex expression of guilt.

"Junior Brother, I'm sorry. It was my momentary carelessness that caused you to lose so many talismans."

At the same time.

Hiss—

A series of sharp intakes of breath suddenly sounded around Zhang Jing.

"I— Junior Brother, Senior Sister told you to prepare, but you didn’t have to buy this many talismans, did you?" Tong Yao stared at Zhang Jing in shock, murmuring, "You're too ruthless. How many Dao merits did this cost? With this method of completing missions, you'll lose even the robes off your back."

Regaining his composure, Senior Brother Zhou still carried a trace of lingering fear as he said sheepishly:

"Thankfully, Junior Brother Zhang was well-prepared. Otherwise, we'd all be cold corpses by now. Junior Brother, don’t worry—Senior Brother will help cover the cost of these talismans."

"Exactly!"

Senior Brother Xia patted his chest and assured Zhang Jing, "Junior Brother, words can't express my gratitude! Calculate how many talismans you used, and we'll find a way to compensate you later."

"Um, Senior Brothers, actually—"

Zhang Jing tried to explain, but his words were cut off by Senior Brother Ding:

"Junior Brother, say no more. The Black Tiger Demon’s corpse and all other spoils belong entirely to you."

"The pelt, fangs, claws, and bones of this mid-Qi Refining demon tiger are all premium materials. Combined, they should fetch around twelve or thirteen Dao merits. Though it's far from covering the value of the talismans you used, it's at least some compensation. For the rest, I'll make it up to you after we complete this mission."

Hearing this, warmth filled Zhang Jing's heart. He quickly did the math in his mind.

His current success rate for crafting low-grade talismans was forty percent. The cost of these thirty Blazing Sun Talismans wouldn't exceed ten Dao merits.

The materials from the demon tiger's corpse would more than cover the cost, even leaving a small profit.

These senior brothers and sisters had treated him with great kindness along the way. Reciprocating their goodwill, Zhang Jing felt it wouldn't be right to haggle over the matter.

Having made up his mind, Zhang Jing smiled shyly and said softly, "Senior Brothers, and Senior Sister Tong, the materials from this demon tiger are more than enough. There's no need for further compensation."

"How can that be?" Tong Yao blurted out bluntly. "How can we take advantage of you like this?"

"Actually, I made all these talismans myself. If what Senior Brother Ding said is accurate, the materials from this demon tiger are already enough to cover the cost of those thirty Blazing Sun Talismans."

Zhang Jing quickly explained.

As soon as these words left his mouth, silence fell all around.

A long moment passed.

"What?! You made all those talismans yourself?" Tong Yao exclaimed in disbelief.

"Junior Brother Zhang, you’ve only been at the Daoist Academy for two months. Reaching the third level of Qi Refining is barely understandable, but crafting talismans—and so many of them—"

Senior Brother Xia waved his hands wildly in front of him, his mind in complete disarray.

"Monstrous talent!"

Senior Brother Zhou sighed in agreement, then suddenly recalled something crucial.

Junior Brother Zhang had said twelve Dao merits could cover the cost of thirty low-grade talismans—and all of them were top-tier quality. No wonder the talisman masters in their Luo Capital squad were so arrogant.

What a lucrative business! No—what a rip-off!

He was still young. Could he save up some Dao merits and exchange for a talisman-crafting inheritance?

What if he succeeded?

At this moment, Senior Brother Zhou was sorely tempted!

Wait—all top-tier quality talismans?

He gaped at Zhang Jing in shock.

Opposite him, Senior Brother Ding's gaze toward Zhang Jing also subtly shifted.

"A demon core! This beast actually had a demon core inside! Junior Brother Zhang is really in for a windfall."

Senior Sister Tong's delighted voice suddenly rang out, startling Zhang Jing, who had just been about to inspect the storage pouch in the tiger demon's mouth.

"Demon core?" He turned to her in confusion.

"Yes, Junior Brother, look."

Senior Sister Tong handed Zhang Jing a thumb-sized, smooth white object radiating intense spiritual energy and explained:

"Demon cores are extremely valuable and fetch high prices. A mid-Qi Refining demon core like this can sell for at least fifty Dao merits. Junior Brother, you’ve hit the jackpot."

Her voice brimmed with excitement.

"Haha, this isn’t just luck for Junior Brother Zhang. It’s mainly because his talismans caught the beast off guard, and I acted quickly, preventing it from fully dispersing the demon core. I had a hunch there might be a core, but I didn’t mention it earlier in case we got our hopes up for nothing."

Senior Brother Ding chimed in.

Turning the demon core over in his hand, Zhang Jing asked curiously:

"Senior Brother, what exactly is a demon core?"

"Junior Brother," Senior Brother Ding smiled and patiently explained, "Unlike us humans, who store spiritual energy in our dantian, demons and monsters distribute their demonic energy throughout their bodies. The demon core is a natural condensation point for this energy—the purest concentration of their demonic power."

"Of course, what I call 'demonic energy' is essentially spiritual energy, but it’s tainted by the resentment and malice of the demon before death, along with some... unique impurities."

"Ah, I was too slow. If I had killed it in one strike during that perfect opportunity, the core wouldn’t have retained any lingering resentment, doubling its value."

"Why would anyone pay such high prices for it?"

"Ha, it’s mainly alchemists who buy them. They use special methods to purify the core, removing the residual resentment and impurities, and then refine it into spiritual pills."

"Ninety percent of the high-grade spiritual pills sold in the Thousand Methods Pavilion are diluted and refined from demon cores."

"But... don’t they say those high-grade pills are made from rare heavenly treasures?"

Zhang Jing’s expression turned odd.

"They do use heavenly treasures—just that one portion can refine dozens of batches of pills. Otherwise, where would they get so many high-grade spiritual pills?"

Senior Brother Ding replied with a teasing smile.

Wordlessly, Zhang Jing pocketed the demon core, deciding it was best not to ask further.
