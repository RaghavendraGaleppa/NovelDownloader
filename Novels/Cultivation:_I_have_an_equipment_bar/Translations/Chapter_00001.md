# Chapter 1: Qingheng Sect, Cultivation Jade Slip

"I can't believe I'm only a low-grade spirit root."

In the Mount Tianmu mountain range, on Mount Qingheng, at the Qingheng Sect, in a medicine garden, a boy who looked about thirteen or fourteen years old had a melancholy expression unbefitting his age.

Zhang Yan, a newly appointed handyman disciple of the Qingheng Sect.

Having just joined the Qingheng Sect and not yet begun cultivation, he was assigned to the Spirit Plant Garden because his Metal, Water, and Wood spirit roots were all low-grade.

"Cultivating immortals is hard too!" Zhang Yan couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration looking at the Spirit Plant Garden, which consisted only of a patch of medicine fields and two thatched huts. In his previous life, he had studied desperately precisely to avoid farming. Unexpectedly, he accidentally enrolled in an agricultural university. After twenty years of struggle, he finally didn't have to toil in the fields under the sun and wind every day. Yet, he woke up to find himself inexplicably transmigrated, not to mention saddled with the fate of farming once again.

Farming before struggling, still farming after struggling.
Farming before transmigration, still farming after transmigration!

Had his struggles been in vain? Had his transmigration been for nothing?

Creeaak~

"Alright, many thanks, Elder Lin."

"Half of it."

This amount was simply pitifully small.

But there was nothing he could do. He wasn't a Spirit Planter yet, had no dedicated spirit fields, and could only follow behind Elder Lin as an apprentice.

"Good, a teachable child!" Seeing Zhang Yan agree, Elder Lin nodded in satisfaction, then casually took out a jade slip from his pouch and handed it over.

"These are the two cultivation methods practiced in our Spirit Plant Garden. Since you've been sent here, you must possess a Wood spirit root," Elder Lin said to Zhang Yan.

"Thank you, Elder Lin." Hearing that it was a cultivation method, Zhang Yan quickly took the jade slip.

But who would have thought?

The moment he touched the jade slip, a prompt unexpectedly appeared before his eyes.

`[Name]: Cultivation Jade Slip`
`[Quality]: Grey`
`[Equip Effect]: Evergreen Cultivation Art (Minor Accomplishment).`
`[Equip? Yes/No]`

"This is..."

"A cheat!"

Confirming that Elder Lin couldn't see the prompt, Zhang Yan couldn't help but swallow.

His golden finger had finally arrived!

Although the effect would disappear once the equipment was unequipped, it could still allow him to comprehend the cultivation method and quickly get started.

"I just don't know what kind of things count as equipment." Zhang Yan frowned. This jade slip was considered a magic tool. If all so-called equipment were magic tools, then it would probably be difficult for him to find a second piece of equipment in the short term.

"Never mind, I'll cultivate first. Cultivate, earn spirit stones, and worry about equipment later." With that thought, Zhang Yan tidied up his dwelling, then sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion and began to cultivate quietly.

As soon as he began, he immediately fell into a quiet state, and with each breath, spiritual energy subtly gathered.

This was the effect of the Evergreen Cultivation Art (Minor Accomplishment).
