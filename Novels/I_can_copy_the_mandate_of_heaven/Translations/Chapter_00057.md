## Chapter 57: The Passage of Time

As the sun set, Xi Qian poured a basin of now-cold water into the courtyard and watched as the young man, Zhong Jun, still lingered outside, listening at the wall. With a gentle hum, she poured the water on the ground.

"Look, young master, what's wrong with having a conversation? You pushing and shoving like that doesn't look good on you," she said with a hint of disdain.

Zhong Jun looked embarrassed but thanked Xi Qian and took the wooden basin from her, preparing to do the laundry. He also said, "Thank you, sister, today. Your hands aren't shaking as much today, and you seem less afraid."

Xi Qian chuckled and said, "Alas, tomorrow it's Jiang Yun's sister's turn. I think the young master likes her a lot."

As they walked further away, under the moonlight, Xi Qian's voice grew louder. "She's from a better family, and she's grown into a beautiful woman, full of charm and elegance. Don't you think the young master talks to her more intimately?"

"After another day, it'll be my turn again. Hehehe," Xi Qian said, her voice rising.

"If you go tomorrow, the young master will definitely ask you about it. He'll frown and ask, 'Sister, where are you from? How are you in my mansion?' Just thinking about it scares me," Zhong Jun said, her legs weakening.

Xi Qian teased her, saying she had to go tomorrow according to the schedule. Zhong Jun protested, but Xi Qian reminded her that she had begged to switch turns.

The two entered their room, where a woman in a white sleeping gown, Jiang Yun, sat with her back to them, staring at the moon.

As they entered, Jiang Yun turned around, her neck as white as moonlight, and smiled. "What's wrong?" she asked.

Xi Qian explained Zhong Jun's situation, and Jiang Yun listened with a gentle smile. When they finished, she patted Zhong Jun's hand and said, "If you want to go tomorrow, go ahead. Don't be afraid; the young master is a kind person."

The three women chatted and whispered until the moon climbed high in the sky, and the crickets began to chirp. As they blew out the oil lamp and slept, the valley grew quiet.

Days passed, and life at the Qixuan Gate was peaceful. A large bird would occasionally fly over, boldly pecking at the medicinal herbs. A massive creature would chase it away, only to sneak back and dig up a herb to eat.

If someone shouted, "The running creature is eating the herbs again!" a young man in a green robe would rush out, wielding a ruler.

However, even in this serene environment, unexpected events occurred. A group of nearly forty injured people arrived a few days later.
