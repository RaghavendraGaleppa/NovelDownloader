# Chapter 6: Conscription  

At that time, the shadowy old man had not communicated with Qin Chong at all, nor had he provided any additional information. It seemed the Eight Trigrams Mirror would require further study on his own.  

The night passed without incident. Qin Chong immersed himself in cultivation, unaware of the time slipping by.  

Early the next morning, he emerged from his hiding spot and mounted his flying sword, continuing his journey toward Pingyang City.  

Just as he was about to reach the city, a flying vessel appeared on the horizon. Upon closer inspection, it was the Flying Dragon Boat of the Canglong Valley. Qin Chong’s heart tightened with unease.  

Pretending nonchalance, he adjusted his course slightly, intending to bypass the vessel from the side.  

Yet, trouble still found him.  

"Fellow Daoist, please stop!" A man aboard the flying boat called out to Qin Chong.  

Halting, Qin Chong took in the situation on the vessel. There were over a dozen Qi Refinement cultivators aboard, all at the mid-to-late stages. Three young men stood at the bow, clad in black robes bearing the insignia of the Canglong Valley—clearly the leaders.  

The foremost among them appeared to be in his twenties, tall and imposing, with a cultivation at the ninth layer of Qi Refinement. However, he never spared Qin Chong a glance, his gaze fixed ahead with an air of detached elegance, exuding the demeanor of a chivalrous hero.  

To his left stood a brawny man in his thirties, his muscular frame barely concealed by his loose robes. His cultivation was at the eighth layer of Qi Refinement.  

The one who had called out to Qin Chong was also in his thirties, shorter and leaner, with a thin mustache that gave him a shrewd appearance. His cultivation was also at the eighth layer.  

"Esteemed Daoists of the Canglong Valley, my apologies for not recognizing you sooner!" Qin Chong responded cautiously, though he felt slightly reassured. They were near Pingyang City, so open conflict was unlikely.  

"Which family do you belong to?" The lean man’s tone carried a hint of arrogance. Given the disparity in strength, Qin Chong had no choice but to endure it.  

"I am Qin Chong of the Qin Clan," he answered honestly.  

"The Qin Clan? Good. By the authority of the Canglong Valley’s outer sect, you are hereby conscripted into our ranks for a mission," the man declared, leaving no room for negotiation.  

"Conscripted? But—"  

Before Qin Chong could voice his reluctance, the aloof young man at the front suddenly turned his piercing gaze on him, unleashing an overwhelming spiritual pressure that bore down on Qin Chong like a tidal wave.  

*Such formidable spiritual pressure!* Qin Chong thought, startled.  

"Humph! Does a minor clan like the Qin Clan dare defy the Canglong Valley’s orders?" the lean man sneered.  

"Of course not! I merely wished to send word to my family first."  

"Send word? Are you doubting our identities?"  

"Please don’t misunderstand, Daoist. I’ve been away from my clan for some time and only wished to inform them of my safety."  

"Trivial matters. We’ll notify your clan. Time is pressing—come with us now."  

Seeing no way out, Qin Chong reluctantly sheathed his flying sword and boarded the Flying Dragon Boat. The vessel then shot toward the Xiao Cang Mountains like a streak of light.  

"Brother Qin, this is Senior Brother Huang Fei, the leader of this mission and an inner disciple of the Canglong Valley. This is Senior Brother Zhang Kui, and I am Liu Hao. Both of us are outer disciples assisting Senior Brother Huang," Liu Hao introduced.  

Qin Chong quickly bowed. "It’s an honor to meet you three. I hope for your guidance in the future."  

"Not bad. You’ve got some sense," Liu Hao remarked. "Perform well on this mission, and you won’t be disappointed."  

"Thank you. I’ll do my best."  

"Good. We still have some distance to cover. Rest and recover in the back for now."  

Qin Chong obediently retreated to an empty spot and sat cross-legged.  

At the rear of the boat sat eleven other male cultivators of varying ages. Qin Chong appeared to be the youngest and weakest among them.  

Though his eyes were closed, Qin Chong wasn’t cultivating. Instead, he pondered the mission.  

The twelve of them—himself included—wore different attire and had disparate cultivation levels. They were likely from minor clans or were rogue cultivators.  

The three Canglong Valley disciples, leveraging their superior strength and the sect’s prestige, had forcibly conscripted them. Whatever task lay ahead couldn’t be simple.  

Qin Chong had heard of such practices before. Canglong Valley disciples often recruited outsiders for dangerous missions, offering meager rewards in exchange for their assistance while the disciples themselves reaped greater benefits upon returning to the sect.  

*The big fish eat the small fish, the small fish eat the shrimp, and the shrimp can only feed on mud.*  

It reminded Qin Chong of his past life—exploitation cascading down the hierarchy, with those at the bottom toiling the hardest for the least reward.  

Times changed, but some truths remained universal.  

To escape the fate of "eating mud," one had to climb upward. How high one could go depended on ability and fortune.  

The Flying Dragon Boat was only about two zhang long and half a zhang wide, making it cramped for over a dozen people. Though packed closely together, no one dared speak, all feigning cultivation with closed eyes.  

Qin Chong sighed inwardly. He had only just left the Xiao Cang Mountains, and now he was being dragged back.  

The boat’s speed far surpassed his flying sword. Within hours, they had reached the Xiao Cang Mountains.  

"Senior Brother Huang, we’ve entered Xiao Cang Mountain territory," Liu Hao reported.  

"Activate the boat’s defensive barrier. We don’t want low-level beasts delaying us."  

"Understood."  

Liu Hao formed hand seals and channeled energy into an array disk at the bow. A faint green barrier enveloped the vessel, shielding it from the turbulent winds outside.  

Though Qin Chong kept his eyes closed, he observed their surroundings with his spiritual sense. Their destination wasn’t the Xiao Cang Mountains—beyond lay the Da Cang Mountains.  

His heart sank. *Could their target be that place?*  

Though he had reached the fifth layer of Qi Refinement, it was a recent breakthrough. Unprepared and armed only with a low-grade magical artifact, venturing there would be perilous.  

But now that he was aboard the boat, retreat was no longer an option.
