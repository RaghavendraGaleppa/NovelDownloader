# Chapter 48: Crimson Divine Radiance

As dusk deepened, Zhang Jing and his companions passed through the city gates.

The bustling scene before them was filled with a constant flow of people, among whom were numerous cultivators—both rogue practitioners and fellow disciples from their Daoist academy, identifiable by their identical cyan robes.

"We've finally reached Langya City," Senior Brother Xia exclaimed with a weary sigh.

The journey from Heishan County to Langya City spanned barely over nine hundred li, yet it had taken Zhang Jing's group a full fifteen days to complete. Constant battles along the way had left them mentally and physically exhausted, their faces etched with deep fatigue.

"We encountered far too many demons and monsters along the way," Senior Brother Ding said with a strained smile. "But at least we've made it to Langya City now. With our senior brothers stationed here, the demons wouldn't dare cause trouble. Let's find an inn to rest tonight and discuss our next steps tomorrow."

"Yes, Senior Brother."
"As you say, Senior Brother."

The group responded in relieved unison.

Before long, they found a decent-looking inn and strode inside.

Before they could even enter, the innkeeper rushed out to greet them, his enthusiasm tinged with caution. "Honored Immortals grace our humble establishment! Might you be seeking lodging?"

"Five superior rooms, and show us to them immediately," Senior Brother Ding instructed.

"At once, Immortals! This way please!"

The innkeeper immediately bowed and led the way, with Zhang Jing and the others following behind.

Upon entering, Zhang Jing noticed that the first-floor hall was already occupied by quite a few cultivators—though all appeared to be rogue practitioners at only the first or second level of Qi Refinement. Numerous gazes, both overt and covert, turned toward the five newcomers.

However, the moment those eyes fell upon their distinctive cyan robes, all attention was hastily withdrawn, and the entire hall fell into silence. Only after Zhang Jing's group had completely disappeared from view did the scattered conversations among the rogue cultivators resume.

Whispers and murmurs filled the air, carried by spiritual senses:

"By the heavens, another group! How many has the Daoist academy sent now?"
"At least several hundred, I'd say."
"This demonic unrest in Langya must be more serious than we thought."
"But isn't this our opportunity? Normally, we'd be lucky to get a single word of guidance from academy disciples. Now we can hunt demons, trade materials for their advice, and maybe even obtain rare resources we've never heard of before."
"Seize this chance, and we might even find the means to break through to mid-stage Qi Refinement!"
"Exactly! I heard someone dug a demon core from a monster's body and traded it to an academy disciple for some high-grade spirit pill. Their cultivation soared overnight!"

One voice suddenly interjected: "Did you notice how young those newcomers looked? Yet the spiritual energy radiating from them—utterly terrifying!"
"Well, aren't all academy disciples like that?"
"Have you heard? The academy recently produced two monstrous talents—under twenty years old, yet they cut down mid-stage Qi Refinement demons like melons and vegetables."
A collective gasp followed.

That night, Zhang Jing abruptly opened his eyes during his seated meditation, a flicker of excitement in his gaze. For once, he hadn't spent the evening crafting talismans—because today, his Pure Essence Absorption Meditation Technique had advanced to the fourth level.

His eyes shifted to examine his status:

[Pure Essence Absorption Meditation Technique - Level 4 (1/1200)]
Skill Traits: Gathering Yuan Radiance (Low-grade), Crimson Divine Radiance (Mid-grade)

Zhang Jing's gaze froze when he saw the new skill trait.

Good news: his meditation technique had reached level four as expected.
Even better news: the new trait was actually a mid-grade one, surpassing all expectations!

"Why would a mid-grade trait appear?" he wondered. "The Pure Essence Absorption Meditation Technique is the most basic foundational method. Could there be secrets within it that everyone overlooked?"

"No—the academy must know about this. Why wouldn't they mention it? Unless... this technique didn't originate from the academy at all?"

His thoughts grew muddled as he recalled his first experience with the technique—that fleeting vision of a pure, majestic radiance occupying an immeasurable sky, serving simultaneously as sun, moon, and countless stars. That light had seemed like the only illumination in existence. Yet in all his subsequent practice, he'd never glimpsed it again.

His mind churned with speculations, each spawning more questions than answers. After what felt like an eternity, Zhang Jing exhaled slowly and buried his doubts deep within. As long as he continued climbing the endless path of immortality, he would uncover these mysteries in time.

Turning his attention to Crimson Divine Radiance, new understanding flowed into his mind. After a long while, enlightenment dawned in his eyes.

Crimson Divine Radiance—the term "Crimson Divinity" referred to a heart as pure as a child's, untainted by inner demons, impervious to external evils, and free of distracting thoughts. The spirit returns to its primordial state, with the self as absolute master of mind and soul. Within the radiance's range, all distracting thoughts and lingering mental residues would be purged.

"This Crimson Divine Radiance might synergize perfectly with my Mind's Eye Dao Seed," Zhang Jing realized. "Together, they could unleash the full potential of the enhanced comprehension granted by Mind's Eye. My skill progression speed would reach new heights, and my cultivation efficiency would improve dramatically!"

A pure mind, free of distractions—wasn't this what his previous life had called the "flow state"? In such a condition, learning and comprehension abilities would operate at their absolute peak. Even his talisman-crafting success rate should see improvement!

Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed with excitement. The more he considered it, the more he realized that Crimson Divine Radiance's seemingly modest description concealed terrifying potential.

Wait a moment—

His gaze sharpened as he reached into his storage pouch, retrieving the demon core from the Black Tiger demon. "The resentment and malice within this core should count as lingering thoughts—or at the very least, external demons," he mused uncertainly.

A crimson glow slowly emanated from his body. As the radiance enveloped the demon core, it began to tremble faintly. Wisps of black smoke rose from its surface before dissipating into nothingness.

Snatches of venomous voices suddenly whispered at the edges of Zhang Jing's hearing, only to vanish instantly:

"Human—you deserve death!"
"How treacherous you are!"
"Kill! Kill! Kill!"
"Hehe, human flesh is so delicious and nourishing!"

The night passed quietly. By dawn, the demon core in Zhang Jing's hand gleamed with crystalline purity under the crimson light, all traces of the demon's lingering hatred completely eradicated.

As the radiance faded, Zhang Jing—ignoring his mental fatigue—lifted the core for closer inspection. Thick spiritual energy lazily seeped from its flawless surface.

"If Senior Brother Ding's information was correct," he calculated, "this mid-stage Qi Refinement demon core should be worth a hundred Dao Merits?"

It seemed he'd discovered yet another method to earn merits.

Knock knock—

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, are you awake?" Senior Brother Ding's voice came through the door. "Deputy Leader Li from our Luodu Squad's Langya garrison wishes to meet you. Come with me at once."

Deputy Leader Li?

Storing the purified demon core in his spirit pendant, Zhang Jing rose and headed for the door. "Senior Brother Ding, why would the deputy leader suddenly want to see me?" he asked curiously.

Senior Brother Ding's face broke into a broad smile. "This is excellent news for you, junior brother. Come quickly—we shouldn't keep Deputy Leader Li waiting."
