# Chapter 50: Qi Condensation Tenth Layer

Watching True Monarch Ling Gu and Li Changxiao depart, Yang Ji was filled with emotion. He never expected that a sword art recording would bring him such a great opportunity, which truly surprised him. If he genuinely went to the Canglan Sect three years later, he would be treated as a quasi-Nascent Soul True Monarch, a status so high that countless cultivators would look upon it with admiration and envy.

Such treatment, if bestowed upon most cultivators, would inevitably lead to a hint of pride. But Yang Ji felt none of it. Even a genius like Li Changxiao, who enjoyed top-tier treatment, didn't show any arrogance, so how could Yang Ji dare to get carried away? The immortal path was boundless; Qi Condensation was merely the starting point. He still had a very long way to go on the path to becoming an immortal. A long journey lay ahead, and being deluded by momentary gains would only shackle his hands and blind his eyes. While his current situation was good, the future held even greater promise.

Due to the extremely high standard of treatment, Yang Ji felt a hint of trepidation, yet also held immense hope. Standing on the shoulders of a giant like the Canglan Sect would allow him to gaze upon the Dao Sect and the path to immortality. His goal was clear: to steadily climb to the very top and achieve eternal life. Before becoming an immortal, all beautiful things were illusory. Time slipped away easily, youth faded quickly; a hundred years were but a blink, a thousand years a flash, and ten thousand years merely a fleeting nap in the river of time. Beneath eternal life, countless cultivators were buried in the swiftly flowing years. Without becoming an immortal, no matter how glorious you were, in the end, you would be nothing but a handful of dust. Perhaps the only things people would remember and cherish were the immortal cave and legacy you left behind. Yes, perhaps your life would be carried on by future generations in an alternative way, but what they carried was merely your will to become an immortal and your cultivation techniques, not your living soul. Not the soul that could perceive the beauty of the world, that could touch the fluctuations of life. Without becoming an immortal, all was ultimately an illusion!

The Canglan Sect brought him great hope, and Yang Ji wanted to seize it and go all out.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a year passed. Everything on Black Wind Island remained as usual. Yang Ji cultivated in an orderly manner. During this period, he also noticed a few unusual gazes, suggesting that a few cultivators on the island had become True Monarch Ling Gu's informants, secretly observing him. But Yang Ji had always lived openly and honestly; if not greatly virtuous, he certainly wasn't greatly wicked. He always adhered to a principle for dealing with the world: three parts caution, three parts kindness, three parts sincerity, and one part ruthlessness and decisiveness reserved for his Golden Finger. A person's life was often lived without full understanding; although good deeds rarely received good returns in the world, he still retained six parts of kindness and sincerity, simply to live with a clear conscience.

Yang Ji did not deliberately disguise his daily behavior, facing it with candor. The Canglan Sect was testing him, and similarly, he was also testing the Canglan Sect. If their temperaments were compatible, then they would walk the Grand Dao together and assist each other on the immortal path. If their temperaments were incompatible, then he would choose a different path and not associate with them. Yang Ji didn't dwell on their observations, carrying on as usual.

During this period, it was worth mentioning that as the demonic energy within Mang Biao was gradually removed, he became increasingly excited and enthusiastic about finding Demon Companion Grass. Yang Ji accumulated more and more high-grade Demon Companion Grass: over a hundred strains aged over a hundred years, more than thirty strains aged over two hundred years, and even one strain over three hundred years old. Such a large quantity of high-grade Demon Companion Grass gave him more leeway in his choices. The Demonic Essence Pills he refined also became increasingly effective for cultivation. As a result, even before three years were up, in just two and a half years, his cultivation not only reached the Tenth Layer of Qi Condensation but also advanced significantly, reaching the peak of the Tenth Layer of Qi Condensation.

At this moment, the spiritual power in his Dantian was as vast and deep as an ocean, extremely pure. This scene was like the rolling clouds at a mountain peak in the early morning, filling the entire spiritual sea. However, at this point, Yang Ji's cultivation could no longer progress further. This was because the Spirit Water Art he cultivated was only a low-grade technique, incapable of purifying spiritual power from a gaseous state to a liquid state. Therefore, he couldn't break through to Foundation Establishment and couldn't create a "spirit differential" between his internal spiritual power and the free spiritual energy outside, preventing the formation of an aura field.

The Foundation Establishment stage represented a transformation of spiritual power and a leap in life. At this level, one could use the aura field generated by the spirit differential to connect with the external free spiritual energy for flight, even without using spells. Simultaneously, they could use the aura field to distort attacks and form defenses. A Foundation Establishment expert could, with a single grab, change the direction of an attack or directly compress the aura field, causing the attack to collapse and vanish. Compared to Qi Condensation, the strength of Foundation Establishment had reached another level. The spiritual power within the body transformed into jade liquid, becoming tens or even dozens of times more potent, unleashing spells with greater power. No matter how skilled an ordinary Qi Condensation cultivator was in combat, they couldn't withstand the "one strong force subdues ten techniques" (might makes right) from a Foundation Establishment cultivator's insane outpouring of spiritual power, which amounted to a full-state saturated attack. To reach Foundation Establishment, a mid-grade or higher cultivation technique was essential; this was the biggest obstacle for ordinary rogue cultivators aiming to advance. Yang Ji was currently unable to overcome this. For the remaining days, he began to furiously refine pills and cultivate the Humanoid Weapon technique, while also sparring with Mang Biao. Mang Biao's demonic energy was almost completely removed by Yang Ji, so he was extremely obliging and enthusiastic about all requests.

All requests were met. With Mang Biao, a Golden Core True Person, as his sparring partner, Yang Ji's combat skills grew increasingly formidable, and his usage of the Departing Sword Dao became more and more proficient. Cultivation was important, but cultivating martial arts was equally important. Not drawing his sword didn't mean his sword wasn't sharp. The tragic experience of his cheap master, whose foundation was destroyed, was still vivid in his mind; Yang Ji didn't want to follow in his footsteps. If he truly became an immortal, he could perhaps burn a Dharma Body containing supreme root bones for his cheap master, erasing the grievances of his life.

Time flew by, half a year passed in a flash, and three years had now arrived.

【Name: Yang Ji】
【Root Bone: Low-Grade】
【Lifespan: 28/100】
【Realm: Qi Condensation Tenth Layer (51200/51200)】
【Cultivation Technique: Spirit Water Art (Low-Grade)】
【Great Divine Ability: Humanoid Weapon - Volume One (Proficient)】

Yang Ji looked at his attributes with satisfaction, then gazed up at the sky, as if waiting for something. Seeing Yang Ji standing by the cliff edge, lost in thought while looking at the sky, Mang Biao felt a complex emotion rise within him. He walked over and chuckled, "Brother, you're going to the Canglan Sect, aren't you?"

"Yes, it's time for the Canglan Sect to recruit External Affairs Disciples again. Without any surprises, I'll be leaving today," Yang Ji said with a faint smile.

"Sigh, little brother, you must come back and visit your big brother often in the future," Mang Biao sighed lightly, his eyes filled with strong reluctance.

Yang Ji glanced at him and said, "Are you afraid that no one will help you remove the demonic energy after you eat Demonic Essence Pills in the future?"

"Cough, cough, is your big brother that kind of person? Your big brother truly wishes you'd come back and visit often," Mang Biao secretly peeked at him, a little guiltily.

"It's not impossible to come back, but you'll have to prepare the Demon Companion Grass for me. I'll exchange it for pills," Yang Ji smiled slightly.

"Hey, what are you saying, little brother? What's mine is yours! Just take it directly when you come back in the future," Mang Biao's eyes lit up, and he patted his chest heartily.

Just as the two were speaking, a black dot suddenly appeared on the horizon and rapidly enlarged before their eyes. The person who arrived was none other than True Monarch Ling Gu. Seeing the arrival, Yang Ji's heart settled slightly; it seemed he had passed the assessment.

"Young friend, come, I'll take you to the sect!" True Monarch Ling Gu said with a smile.

"Thank you, Senior!" To be personally escorted by a Nascent Soul True Monarch was a great honor. Yang Ji bowed deeply and no longer feigned humility.

"Then let us go." True Monarch Ling Gu descended, grabbed Yang Ji, and flew into the sky.

"Little brother, remember to come back! I'll definitely prepare the Demon Companion Grass properly!" Mang Biao shouted towards the two rapidly disappearing black dots in the distance.
