# Chapter 561: Alchemy Pills from the Sea of Blood

“No! Even if this venerable one must die, I will not allow a junior like you to defile my Dao Foundation! Sea of Filth True Source, explode! Explode! Explode!! I will drag you down with me!!”

Extreme terror, boundless hatred, and the madness of despair from having five lifetimes of effort wash away in vain completely consumed Blood Ancestor Devil’s last shred of sanity.

The ball of filth origin blood light, compressed to the extreme yet glowing with an increasingly demonic and sinister radiance, suddenly erupted with a terrifying dark blood luster that seemed capable of ending all things and dragging this heaven and earth into ruin.

An indescribable destructive fluctuation frantically condensed and compressed within it.

Dao Foundation Self-Detonation.

Xu Yunfan’s pupils contracted slightly.

Blood Ancestor Devil was about to self-detonate.

He was引爆引爆引爆 his five lifetimes of Foundation Establishment, accumulating a terrifyingly thick Sea of Filth Sinking Turbulence Dao Foundation.

Once it exploded, with the cultivation of a late Foundation Establishment realm, the filth power capable of polluting a radius of ten thousand miles and turning it into a dead land, along with the resentment and evil energy, would be completely detonated.

Even with the vast Thunder Domain Great Array laid down by Xu Yunfan to seal the area, it would likely drag all the disciples of the Divine Skyscraper Peak along for the ride, and even take down as many of those secretly spying figures as possible.

In that instant, all the divine senses secretly probing from the shadows erupted with violent fluctuations!

From the direction of the Cold Marrow Peak, that glacier-like divine sense suddenly froze, the spiritual sense fluctuating violently. The heavens and earth produced strange phenomena, as if an iceberg was about to shatter.

The Blackheart Old Freak from the Soul Refining Peak let out a sharp divine sense screech.

“Madman, this old devil has gone mad!!”

Liu Yunhua, the Hundred Flowers True Person, lost control over herself for the first time in her divine sense, leaving only horror and confusion.

How could he dare to act so brazenly?

Was he not afraid of attracting a True Lord, causing him to suffer for eternity without reincarnation?

The vast will of Sect Master Tian Yan True Lord suddenly retracted. He rose from his meditation cushion and took a step forward, seeming as if he wanted to intervene by crossing space.

But the next moment, as if remembering something, he forcefully halted his movement.

A hint of a smile appeared on his face.

“Then, so be it.”

Li Wei on another peak saw this scene and his expression changed drastically. The next second, an extremely excited light burst from his eyes, an unsettling emotion that feared the world wasn't chaotic enough making his cheeks flush red.

“How many years has it been? The Primordial Origin Sect hasn't been this lively for so long. Good, good! It’s good to have some liveliness!”

Inside the Divine Skyscraper Peak, Bi Yuan and the other disciples had faces ashen as ash, their bodies cold, as if they were already standing at the edge of hell.

Only the face of the Thunder Lord within the Purple宸 Transformation Thunder Lord Avatar condensed by Xu Yunfan, those eyes formed from the condensation of countless tribulation thunders, showed not the slightest bit of panic, but instead erupted with even more scorching thunder light.

“Fool who seeks to burn his body and destroy his Dao!”

Under this Nine Heavens Threshold Five Elements Yin Yang Thunder Domain and Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Qi, he doesn't even qualify to die.

The avatar’s grand voice was like a thunderclap from the nine heavens, drowning out Blood Ancestor Devil’s insane howling.

The hundred-zhang tall Thunder Lord giant, with the Heavenly Punishment Thunder Halberd in his left hand, pointed forward fiercely. The tip of the halberd acted as a brush, and the void as a talisman, drawing upon the immense power of the entire great array.

Simultaneously, his right hand made a grasping motion towards the ball of filth origin that was about to explode. The array formation above his condensed Dao Foundation rumbled into motion.

“Nine宸 Lock Devil Primordial Thunder Talisman Array, lock heaven, lock earth, lock devil source!”

Hum!

Boom!!!

Inside the Thunder Lord Avatar, nine thick, incomparable, shimmering with purple-gold immortal light Divine Skyscraper Thunder Chains, like awakened ancient dragons, erupted violently from the Thunder Lord’s body.

They were no longer coiled around the core of the Thunder Pill, but instantly pierced through the clouds, connecting the sky and the ground.

Of the nine thunder chains, eight fiercely pierced into the eight nodes of the Nine Heavens Threshold Five Elements Yin Yang Thunder Domain Great Array, completely anchoring and stabilizing the entire array.

The core and thickest one, like a spear that split the heavens, carried a pure and ultimate intent of destruction and restraint. Ignoring the distance of space, it directly pierced through the core of the compressed filth origin of Blood Ancestor Devil.

“Ugh Ah!!”

Blood Ancestor Devil’s final mad roar was strangled in his throat.

The moment the core thunder chain pierced through, the power with which he burned his filth origin and the intent to detonate his Dao Foundation.

The blood sea Dao Foundation accumulated over five lifetimes was all forcibly shattered and dispersed by an overbearing thunder destruction intent.

It was like a red-hot branding iron plunged into a pot of oil about to boil; all the violent energy was instantly extinguished.

“ Heaven and earth as the furnace, Eight Sceneries as the fire, ten thousand thunders as the guide, Divine Skyscraper forges the pill! Refine!”

This final ‘Refine’ incantation seemed to drain all the essence energy between heaven and earth.

The body of the Purple宸 Transformation Thunder Lord Avatar suddenly became somewhat illusory, but the main peak’s earth veins beneath the Divine Skyscraper Peak groaned as they output a massive amount of spiritual energy. The Five Elements Yin Yang array diagram in the sky spun frantically, devouring the spiritual energy from all directions.

The Eight Sceneries cloud qi filling the heavens and earth burned to its limit at this moment, turning translucent, flowing with countless fine Cloud Seals of Heaven Refining as liquid divine flames.

The ten thousand paths of divine thunder no longer struck separately, but transformed into billions of pure Divine Skyscraper thunder light hammers. Carrying Xu Yunfan’s will and the power of the entire great array, they hammered down frantically from all directions upon the filth origin nailed down by the Nine宸 Lock Devil Thunder Chains.

Every hammer strike of thunder was accompanied by the sharp wail of the blood sea origin. This commotion was essentially the process of Blood Ancestor Devil’s blood sea Dao Foundation, along with his magic power origin, being forcibly purified.

Every time the cloud flame calcined, a large patch of black-red filth impurities carrying vicious curses and the will of sinking would be forcibly evaporated and refined.

That core filth blood light, under the calcining and refining of infinite great force and the Eight Sceneries divine flame, was like scrap iron thrown into Taishang Laojun’s Eight Trigram Furnace, its volume frantically shrinking.

Its color rapidly faded from a demonic, thick blood red to a deep, restrained dark red hue that seemed capable of containing all filth yet faintly透出 an immortal aura.

Blood Ancestor Devil’s consciousness had long since been completely refined and annihilated at this moment. What remained was only that ball of forcibly shattered, refined, and purified origin.

It, along with the fragments of the five lifetimes Sea of Filth Sinking Turbulence Dao Foundation, instinctively聚合, and slowly condensed under the array, Eight Sceneries cloud qi, Divine Skyscraper ten thousand thunders.

Time seemed to stretch out infinitely long at this moment.

One breath, a hundred breaths... half an hour.

At the peak of the Divine Skyscraper Peak, the endless thunderous roars and the howling of the cloud flames gradually weakened.

The grand array diagram that enveloped a hundred miles of heaven and earth slowly faded away. The Eight Sceneries cloud qi permeating the space rolled back like a tide, merging back into the Thunder Lord Avatar phantom.

The light of the hundred-zhang Thunder Lord Avatar also dimmed by eighty to ninety percent, and finally vanished into the void like an illusion.

Only Xu Yunfan’s figure stood alone, his face pale as paper, the aura around him fluctuating unsteadily, clearly showing he had suffered a massive consumption.

And before him, where Blood Ancestor Devil had originally been about to self-detonate, all the filth, evil energy, and resentment had vanished.

Not even a trace of blood scent remained.

Only a pill the size of a dragon’s eye, flowing with a deep dark golden luster all over, with nine naturally formed purple-gold patterns like chains circling its surface, quietly floated in mid-air.
