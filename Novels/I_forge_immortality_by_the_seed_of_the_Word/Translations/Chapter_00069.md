# Chapter 68: The Mysterious Silk Fragment

"What treasure?"

Zhang Jing curiously scanned the herb garden before him, his gaze seemingly trying to penetrate layers of soil to identify what exactly Deer Thirty-Eight was referring to.

"Ah, what treasure? Well..."

Deer Thirty-Eight's eyes darted about as he answered sheepishly:

"Reporting to the immortal, this has been passed down through generations of our family. To be honest, we don't actually know what the treasure is."

"Through so many generations, not a single deer has dug it up to look?"

Zhang Jing looked at Deer Thirty-Eight with astonishment, his voice tinged with disbelief.

He found it hard to imagine that from Deer Eleven to Deer Thirty-Eight—spanning over twenty generations—knowing there was a treasure beneath them, not one deer had bothered to investigate.

"Why would we dig it up?"

"Our Deer family has cultivated spiritual herbs here generation after generation—eating, sleeping, and repeating. Life is good this way. What if digging up that treasure ruins the herb garden? What would we do then?"

Deer Thirty-Eight answered honestly.

Ah, so that's why.

Zhang Jing nodded in understanding. From their perspective, that line of thinking made sense.

Meanwhile, Deer Thirty-Eight grew increasingly nervous as the immortal before him remained silent about the matter of becoming a mount. His voice trembled as he pleaded:

"Immortal, do I... do I still have a chance?"

"A chance? You mean as a mount?"

A faint smile appeared at the corners of Zhang Jing's eyes as he studied the white deer before him, who seemed to be shrinking into himself. He drew out his words deliberately:

"Deer Thirty-Eight—"

At the sound of his name, the white deer trembled even more violently, not daring to even breathe heavily. His eyes were tightly shut, as if awaiting judgment.

"Considering your sincere attitude, we can give it a try."

The words were spoken casually, but to Deer Thirty-Eight, they sounded like heavenly music.

He had survived!

Deer Thirty-Eight's body went limp as he collapsed to the ground, his eyes glistening with tears of relief.

"Thank you, Master! Your mercy is boundless! I swear to turn over a new leaf and become a better deer!"

"Call me 'Lord' instead."

Zhang Jing found the title "Master" unappealing and corrected him with a smile.

"Yes, Lord!"

"Step aside for now. I need to harvest these spiritual herbs," Zhang Jing instructed.

At once, Deer Thirty-Eight sprang to his feet, his large deer face breaking into an ingratiating smile.

"My Lord, how could I trouble you with such menial labor? Leave it to me—this is my specialty!"

After speaking, Deer Thirty-Eight hurriedly brought over a stone and wiped it clean with his snowy white fur.

"My Lord, please rest here."

"Very well."

Zhang Jing nodded with a smile and sat down on the stone.

Meanwhile, Deer Thirty-Eight carefully entered the herb garden and began digging up the spiritual herbs with surprising delicacy and skill. The sight of his large hooves working with such precision gave Zhang Jing the odd impression of watching embroidery.

About half an hour later...

"My Lord, all the spiritual herbs have been harvested."

Deer Thirty-Eight approached Zhang Jing and reported softly.

Opening his eyes, Zhang Jing couldn't hide his surprise.

Before him, over a hundred spiritual herbs had been neatly arranged and categorized according to their elemental attributes and grades.

Clearly, Deer Thirty-Eight had put considerable thought into this.

"You've worked hard."

Zhang Jing's voice carried a hint of warmth.

"Not at all, not at all! You're the one who's worked hard, my Lord. I'll go dig up that treasure now."

Catching the change in Zhang Jing's tone, Deer Thirty-Eight grinned broadly, his expression jubilant.

Ancestors be praised!

This old deer is definitely going to survive!

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing turned his attention to the harvested spiritual herbs.

After counting, he found twenty-three water-attribute herbs—his primary concern—among which were several mid and high-grade varieties. If used for cultivation, they would likely push his cultivation to the seventh level of Qi Refinement.

As for the rest...

Zhang Jing's gaze swept over the herbs of the other four elements. Many were high-grade, and while their exact value was uncertain, they should more than cover the merit points needed for the top-tier inheritance he sought.

He exhaled slowly.

At this moment, all he wanted was to return to the Dao Academy as soon as possible.

Time passed quietly.

"My Lord! My Lord! I've found the treasure! Come take a look!"

Deer Thirty-Eight's excited shout broke the silence.

In a few quick steps, Zhang Jing stood before the large pit the deer had dug, peering downward.

At the center lay a palm-sized object resembling a piece of cloth.

The fragment was mottled yellow and black, its edges irregular—as if torn violently from something larger.

Even more remarkable were the five-colored lights that occasionally shimmered across its surface.

With each pulse of light, it drew in the surrounding elemental energies from the earth's veins. Most were absorbed by the fragment itself, while a small portion dispersed into the surroundings.

Understanding dawned in Zhang Jing's eyes.

So it was this broken cloth fragment that had been gathering the elemental energies, allowing so many different spiritual herbs to thrive here simultaneously.

He floated down gracefully as Deer Thirty-Eight quickly scrambled out of the pit to give his lord space.

Approaching the mysterious fragment, Zhang Jing bent down and grasped its edge, attempting to lift it.

But as soon as he applied force, he realized something was amiss.

Despite its small size and seemingly light appearance, the fragment weighed as much as a thousand jun. The strength he was using could easily lift an ox, yet the cloth didn't budge.

How interesting.

A spark of curiosity lit in Zhang Jing's eyes.

What material was this made of? For such a small piece to be so incredibly heavy...

Increasing his strength severalfold, he finally managed to lift the fragment—though his feet had sunk over two feet into the ground in the process.

Ignoring this, he immediately began examining the mysterious cloth.

Yet after extensive inspection, he found nothing. Both his spiritual sense and energy were swallowed up upon contact, vanishing without a trace.

Activating his Heart's Eye Dao Seed yielded no better results. The fragment remained as inscrutable as an unfathomable abyss.

Eventually, Zhang Jing gave up. He would have to wait until his cultivation advanced further.

But when he tried storing the fragment in his spatial storage, neither his storage pouch nor his jade pendant responded.

"Is the fragment's grade too high for storage, or is there another reason?"

His brow furrowed slightly.

If it couldn't be stored, he would have to carry it with him—and this thing was far from light.

As he pondered, his gaze fell upon Deer Thirty-Eight, who was watching him with wide, innocent eyes.

"Thirty-Eight..." he called out warmly.

The deer shuddered involuntarily.

Not long after, at the cave's narrow exit:

"Thirty-Eight, is this really how you usually come and go?"

Zhang Jing's face darkened as he spoke.

Before him, Deer Thirty-Eight was struggling to squeeze his massive body through the tight fissure, his face contorted with effort and his antlers creaking alarmingly.

"Heh, my Lord, this is how we've always done it."

Deer Thirty-Eight grinned before resuming his laborious wriggling.

"Don't you know any size-changing techniques?"

"I... don't think so."

"I'll find one for you when we return."

"Many thanks, my Lord!"
