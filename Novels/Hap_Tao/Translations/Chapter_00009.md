# Chapter 9: Crossing Blows

"Xiaoqiang, with your skills, finding a decent job shouldn't be difficult. Why must you go to the martial arena? The fights there are brutal—there have already been many cases of severe injuries and deaths," Qin Ziling frowned as he spoke.

"I know," Liu Xiaoqiang replied. "But as a martial apprentice who's only trained in muscle and tendon techniques, I won't attract the attention of wealthy families unless I demonstrate exceptional combat prowess. Only by impressing them can I become a family guard or head of security in a wealthy household. That's the only way I can quickly accumulate enough wealth to buy meat and medicinal herbs for nourishment, and have a chance to break through to the skin-membrane realm."

Seeing Liu Xiaoqiang's determination, Qin Ziling didn't press further. He assumed a horse-riding stance and began swinging a stone weight upward from between his legs with one hand, training his muscular strength. Yet he couldn't help feeling a pang of sorrow.

In the past, he hadn't fully grasped the saying "master both literary and martial arts to serve the emperor." Now, he understood it all too well.

Noticing Qin Ziling had fallen silent and was fully focused on his training, Liu Xiaoqiang's lips moved as if to say something, but he ultimately remained quiet.

As he swung the stone weight, Qin Ziling could clearly feel surges of qi and blood circulating through his tensed muscles and tendons, like water sloshing in a bucket, continuously impacting his skin membrane.

However, his skin membrane was thin and porous—practically riddled with holes. Whenever the qi and blood surged against it, they dissipated as heat.

Qin Ziling's qi and blood were already insufficient due to his lack of nourishing meat and medicinal herbs—it was as if the bucket barely had any water to begin with. After a few sloshes, there was hardly any qi and blood left to circulate.

Only his palms, toughened by Cold Iron Palm training, had a relatively thicker skin membrane that retained more qi and blood. He could distinctly feel the force of the qi and blood impacting the membrane, and how the constant impact subtly tempered and nourished it, making it thicker and more sensitive.

"Since my rebirth, my senses have been sharp, but that was only toward the external world—my perception of my internal state wasn't as refined. Who would have thought that after practicing the 'Indestructible Starlight Visualization Technique' yesterday, my sensitivity during training today would be so different? It seems that before this, despite having a powerful soul, I didn't know how to condense it into a focused force—my strength was scattered, so I couldn't perceive the subtleties within my body."

"Now that I've trained my soul specifically, my internal perception has also sharpened. The scriptures say that the body is a boat, and the soul is the one who steers it. The stronger the soul, the greater the control over the body. It seems cultivating the soul greatly aids martial training." This discovery filled Qin Ziling with excitement, and his confidence in reaching the skin-membrane realm in a short time soared.

To master the skin-membrane realm of the Cold Iron Palm, there were only two key factors: external and internal.

The external factor involved repeatedly striking fine iron sand mixed with medicinal herbs with the palms, followed by washing the hands with a unique medicinal solution to disinfect, reduce swelling, and nourish the skin and flesh while strengthening the bones and tendons of the hands. The internal factor involved using certain Cold Iron Palm techniques to sense the qi and blood impacting and nourishing the skin membrane, then gradually learning to control the membrane to seal in the qi and blood.

With daily nourishment from meat and medicinal herbs, the qi and blood would be abundant, making the impact force stronger and more noticeable—thus making it easier to enter the skin-membrane realm.

Of course, controlling the skin-membrane's force was fundamentally different from controlling muscle and tendon force. Even with ample qi and blood, some innate talent was still required to break through to this realm.

Thus, the skin-membrane realm was the first major threshold in martial arts. Many people were stuck at this stage, especially those from poor backgrounds who lacked nourishing meat and medicinal herbs. Without sufficient qi and blood, breaking through became even harder, and the vast majority remained trapped at this barrier.

Qin Ziling's innate talent had been mediocre before, and without nourishing meat and herbs to replenish his qi and blood, his daily training of the Cold Iron Palm only toughened his palms without allowing him to sense the qi and blood surging within the skin membrane. Naturally, the skin-membrane realm remained out of reach.

Now, with his soul strengthened and refined, his internal perception sharpened, and his control over his body enhanced, Qin Ziling had effectively become a prodigy. Even without nourishing meat and herbs, as long as he followed the Lin family's Cold Iron Palm techniques and used their unique medicinal solution, he could eventually seal his skin membrane and reach the skin-membrane realm.

However, without ample qi and blood to nourish the membrane, the process would undoubtedly be much slower. With sufficient nourishment, though, he could swiftly break through.

Qin Ziling set down the stone weight and practiced several sets of the Lin family's Cold Iron Palm techniques, carefully sensing the qi and blood surging against his palm membranes as his muscles and tendons exerted force. Yet his internal qi and blood were too sparse—the impact was weak and short-lived, and his skin membrane couldn't seal in the energy.

"It seems the key now is to find a way to obtain nourishing meat and medicinal herbs as soon as possible," Qin Ziling mused inwardly after finishing another set. He slowly lowered his hands to his abdomen and exhaled deeply.

"Warmed up enough? Let me give you some pointers now." At that moment, Nangong Yue, who had just finished his private training session, approached with a cat-playing-with-mouse expression.

"Senior Brother Nangong, you're already at the skin-membrane realm—a whole level above Ziling—and his foundation is weak. How about I spar with you instead? My skin's thick and tough; a few strikes won't hurt me much," Liu Xiaoqiang said, stepping forward with a slight frown when he saw Nangong Yue approaching Qin Ziling.

"Humph! Precisely because Qin Ziling's foundation is weak, he needs to train with me more. Getting hit by me here will just sting a little. But if he goes out there and loses because of his poor skills, the consequences won't just be pain—it could mean permanent injury or death, and it would tarnish our martial school's reputation!" Nangong Yue's expression darkened as he spoke coldly.

Liu Xiaoqiang was straightforward and honest. Seeing Nangong Yue's thinly veiled malice—using his seniority to justify bullying Qin Ziling—his face flushed with anger. He was about to retort when Qin Ziling stopped him with a faint smile.

"Xiaoqiang, Senior Brother Nangong is right. My foundation is weak, so I need to train harder. It's rare for him to offer guidance—I should cherish the opportunity."

"Ziling, he's clearly—" Liu Xiaoqiang fumed.

"Liu Xiaoqiang!" Qin Ziling tugged at his sleeve and gave him a meaningful look.

Though simple and direct, Liu Xiaoqiang knew that Nangong Yue's family held some influence in the city, and as the head instructor's favored disciple, any defiance would only lead to both of them being punished. Reluctantly, he swallowed his words.

Seeing Qin Ziling—who would have once flared up in anger—suddenly so composed, Nangong Yue smirked coldly and lowered his voice. "Don't think this attitude will make me go easy on you, Qin Ziling."

"Feel free to hold nothing back, Senior Brother," Qin Ziling replied calmly. He took a few steps back, raising one hand forward and keeping the other behind him, assuming the "Old Monk Holding a Bowl" stance.
