# Chapter 204: Priceless New Silk Script

In the remnants of the thatched cottage, bamboo slips lay scattered on the bluestone table. There was originally a large pile, but most were incinerated when the woman ascended, leaving only a small portion behind. Both youths held bamboo slips, incredibly excited. One laughed heartily, somewhat madly, incoherent, wanting the heavens to rub him. The other was filled with joy, his eyes burning as he stared at the bamboo slips, eager to immediately practice martial arts and slap the heavens.

"I've comprehended! I understand! This is how the path should be walked!" Little Wu gripped the bamboo slips, various insights flooding his mind as he nodded repeatedly.

Qin Ming felt that every single bamboo slip was priceless, a divine artifact. Initially, he was shocked because he saw the Silk Script technique on them. The characters were densely packed, as if they had endured a thousand years, yet remained clear. Various human-like patterns seemed to embody the vicissitudes of history. The bamboo pieces had yellowed, definitively ancient artifacts. He had thought they were left by the Patriarch, but after careful study and comprehension, he found these Silk Script techniques were somewhat different, seemingly refined and slightly altered.

Soon, he understood. These were all problems he usually pondered, now appearing on the bamboo slips with "new interpretations."

"This tea... it's incredible. And these bamboo slips are truly miraculous; they reflect my heart!" The light in Qin Ming's eyes grew increasingly fierce, as if the flame of enlightenment had ignited, transforming his entire being and making him radiant.

"Brother, it's actually resolving my confusion; my path has become smooth..." Little Wu said, his past dilemmas now easily solved as he gripped the bamboo slips tightly.

Qin Ming shook his head, saying, "It's not giving you answers to your confusion, but rather reflecting your heart. This tea has enhanced your comprehension. The problems we've accumulated and have been studying, now that we're thinking deeply, naturally yield new interpretations."

Little Wu nodded. "Yes, a single flash of insight used to be rare. Now, I have insights constantly shimmering!" Then, he fell silent. Such a state was incredibly rare, a "moment" within the realm of enlightenment that money couldn't buy.

Undoubtedly, the bamboo slips reflecting one's heart, coupled with the mysterious tea, caused comprehension to skyrocket in a short time. For different people, the effects were entirely different. For someone with Patriarch-level talent, if their comprehension suddenly increased by a large margin, several times their usual, such a state would be truly "terrifying."

Holding the bamboo slips, the fog in Qin Ming's mind was continuously dispelled. The problems he usually pondered now gradually had clear answers. He normally studied the Silk Script, accumulating various clues and insights. Some issues were just a hair's breadth from resolution, and now he naturally crossed that threshold.

"With the previous Silk Script technique, I temporarily resolved the issue of my body exploding, but the subtle details were not perfect." Qin Ming utilized this special state of sudden enlightenment to perfect it, deeply expanding on the problems he usually considered, and cross-referencing them with the refined version of the Silk Script technique obtained in the divine temple. Recently, he had carefully studied the Silk Script technique from the divine temple. The modifications in the nascent field were very small, and after practicing with them, he found those few small details were indeed more exquisite. He gained an insight from this: he needed to start from the subtle details, employing the approach of the "Fate Altering Scripture."

When practicing the Fate Altering Scripture, he went with the flow, exhibiting a "Tao follows nature" quality, performing his cultivation instinctively. Qin Ming at that time commanded the scripture's essence, not entirely trusting the schematic diagrams in the main outline. Instead, after uniting the Heavenly Light Energy, Divine Wisdom, and Spiritual Radiance of Consciousness, he allowed them to naturally spread, forging a new path under the main outline. He pondered the subtle intricacies of the Silk Script technique. Some of the problems he had contemplated, now that the fog had cleared, had new interpretations, and he was ready to put them into action.

Little Wu was smiling, looking quite foolish, but from another perspective, it was a manifestation of an innocent, childlike mindset after achieving enlightenment.

Qin Ming didn't disturb him. He picked up his own teacup and drank a bit more this time, because his next actions were crucial and would greatly impact him. In an instant, his mind rotated like lightning, completely devoid of chaotic thoughts, immersing itself in the field he was conquering. What he thought was reflected on the bamboo slips.

Qin Ming was extremely familiar with the Silk Script technique. He had practiced it the longest, for over ten years since childhood, always strictly following the instructions in the book. Now, he broke old rules. While the overall meaning of the scripture remained unchanged, he let the Silk Script technique operate freely, embodying a sense of spontaneous elegance. Qin Ming observed carefully. The overall route showed almost no change, seemingly maintaining its inertial progression. However, his current state was very special. His spiritual intuition was extremely keen, and he noticed slight sluggishness in some subtle areas.

"Change it!" Qin Ming quickly made his choice. After the subtle path adjustment, he found that the sluggishness disappeared. Normally, to discover and improve these things, he wouldn't know how long it would take. It would certainly require repeated observation and refinement to perfect. Today, however, was different. His comprehension and talent were already formidable. Even being modest, he was at least at a "Patriarch-level" foundation. Now, with the temporary surge, it was simply "terrifying." At present, Qin Ming's thoughts were clear, insights flashed like lightning, constantly interweaving. His state of enlightenment could shock many renowned figures.

"The subtleties here are not natural enough, too deliberate. The micro-circulation path is dimmer than elsewhere." In this extraordinary state, he could discover problems he normally couldn't see. Qin Ming completed a cycle, restarted, and then improved it again, making several micro-adjustments in succession. He repeatedly circulated the Silk Script technique, closing his eyes, letting nature take its course, allowing the blazing sun-like Heavenly Light Energy to flow. He felt that the Silk Script technique had reached its most suitable and perfect moment for him in the first realm! The dazzling Heavenly Light, like a dense spiderweb, interwove within his flesh and blood, flowing rapidly. He found it was more compatible with his body than before. Qin Ming felt that if he operated his Heavenly Light Energy along this finely tuned route, its power should increase!

A moment later, he opened his eyes and saw Little Wu smiling foolishly while drinking tea. Qin Ming picked up his teacup and drank tea for the third time. This time, it was finally almost empty.

Not far away, those people couldn't see the remnants of the thatched cottage. They only saw the two individuals drinking illusory tea amidst the thorns, holding intangible bamboo slips, smiling foolishly, and attaining enlightenment. They were utterly speechless. However, a few individuals looked serious as they watched, such as Ling Yu and Xin Youdao. Even Liu Hanyue was shocked, as she, too, had come to believe that the two youths were unfathomable.

This time, when Qin Ming circulated the Silk Script technique, at a crucial moment, he paused slightly, then decisively merged his Heavenly Light Energy, Divine Wisdom, and Spiritual Radiance of Consciousness into one. Clearly, he was re-enacting the process and state he experienced when comprehending the "Fate Altering Scripture." After the Silk Script technique merged with the other two powers, it was equally smooth. Qin Ming wasn't surprised, as they had already been intertwined in his daily life.

"Oh, the subtle details are even clearer now." Qin Ming's flesh and blood were illuminated, as if golden rivers were traversing the mist-shrouded land, constantly pioneering and spreading throughout his body, dispelling the darkness. During this process, Qin Ming found only one sluggish spot, which was negligible, but he still tried to change the path. Afterward, he separately circulated the Heavenly Light Energy and found it could be modified. Finally, Qin Ming had an epiphany: this route was most suitable for him. By integrating his consciousness and divine wisdom into the Heavenly Light Energy, like planting seeds in the soil of his physical body, it was akin to cultivation, allowing him to anticipate the revival of all things and a future harvest season.

His improvements to the Silk Script technique were completely finished. At this point, he felt complete!

Qin Ming drank the last dregs of tea, read the bamboo slips, and began to comprehend other scriptures, such as re-enacting the Li Fire Scripture and Wu Ji Scripture, and even more diligently studying the Golden Cicada Scripture and Dragon Serpent Scripture. Finally, he picked up the teapot, shook it repeatedly, and poured out a few more drops, which he drank. He noticed that the tea's effect was no longer as potent; it seemed the previous amount was just right for him.

"Brother, I still have some in my cup, do you want it? If I drink more, I don't seem to feel anything, no more sudden enlightenment," Little Wu said. He was already very satisfied, with many confusions resolved.

"No need," Qin Ming shook his head.

"Then let's leave it for someone fated to find it," Little Wu didn't force himself to drink it, leaving some dregs. He yearned greatly, saying, "This is just leftover tea, perhaps eroded by a thousand years, yet it can have such effects. If it were fresh tea... I dare not imagine. If we found such a tea plantation, *hiss*, I feel I could forge a path all on my own!" Clearly, he had gained a tremendous harvest just now!

Qin Ming believed that what he gained today could influence his entire future path. In a state of enlightenment several times greater than a Patriarch, he adjusted the Silk Script technique for himself. The process seemed ordinary, but if others knew, it would be no less than lightning falling from the nine heavens, constantly exploding on the nascent path!

When Qin Ming walked out, he found that many teams had already set off. Those people didn't want to watch the two of them "perform," deeming it too "fake." In the distance, Ling Yu and Xin Youdao nodded towards them, then quickly departed, catching up with their own teams. They had been warned not to get too close to these two, which left them quite regretful.

"Mountain River No. 2 hasn't left yet," Little Wu said. In the distance, Liu Hanyue and the people around her rolled their eyes upon hearing him; this guy was too vengeful.

"Junior brothers, let's go, walk together," Liu Hanyue proactively invited. Qin Ming and Little Wu didn't refuse, happily following them. With a large group to explore those mysterious territories, they could save a lot of effort. Now, everyone knew that the spirit herbs, minerals, and other discoveries in the real world were far inferior to the wondrous opportunities perceived through spiritual sense.

Ahead, the teams diverged. Some people no longer wished to travel together; the teams split up to explore individually. Soon, in the dense forest, a large group of people divided into many smaller groups. However, they soon converged on one spot again, because it was too special. Five-colored, vibrant mist swirled there, visible even from a great distance. Of course, many new cultivators were exceptions; they couldn't perceive anything unless they reached the Outer Saint level, where some Spiritual Radiance of Consciousness had begun to form.

"This place is truly absurd. In the thick mist, one can see another self, and fight against that self. Only by defeating that self can one pass through. If you fail, you'll never see the five-colored mist again."

"I really want to punch someone! Just now, I was actually defeated by myself! It hurt like hell!" In fact, many had failed. They discovered that the "self" in the mist was their most powerful self from the past. Currently, many could only manage a draw at best.

Qin Ming said, "In that realm where reality and mystical space merge, all arrangements have profound meaning." He had just finished his enlightenment and precisely needed this kind of tempering. In every way, the two places seemed connected, making this the best cultivation ground.

"It hurts so much, I was almost beaten to death by myself!" Gan Jincheng vomited a mouthful of blood and retreated. He was also an outstanding figure among this group, yet still couldn't pass his own trial.

Someone suggested, "Everyone, after entering, once your reflection appears, don't rush to act. First, meditate quietly there. If you can achieve new advancements, then try to pass the trial. Otherwise, don't even attempt it."

After a group of people passed by this five-colored mist-shrouded area, they suddenly turned back, having heard significant commotion coming from within. "Hiss, no way, are those two guys really that fierce?" Someone remembered that those two strange youths were once again at the back. Were they trying to pass the trial now? The commotion was a bit too loud!

It was clear that Liu Hanyue had made up her mind to cling to their "golden thigh." These two junior brothers were too extraordinary. She let her own team go ahead while she waited quietly here. She witnessed firsthand a magnificent arched bridge appearing in the thick mist, its aura terrifying beyond measure. Immediately after, her face turned pale with fright. She saw on the other side what looked like a brilliant sun rising from the mist over the sea, its radiating light making her soul uncomfortable. One must remember, she was outside that area. If she stood up close, she simply dared not imagine.

"This... Lesser Patriarch-level talent, no, it feels even more terrifying than Ling Yu!" Liu Hanyue was shocked, finding the two youths in the vibrant mist more outrageous than the last. She believed that if the nascent cultivator unleashed a punch like a blazing sun, none of them would be able to block it. Especially, for those on the Immortal Path, if their Spiritual Radiance of Consciousness dared to extend, it would probably be ignited instantly!

Soon after, Qin Ming and Little Wu successively walked out of this vibrant, five-colored area. They found it very novel that they could fight against another version of themselves. However, the "selves" reflected in the colorful mist were their states from before today. They did not show the changes they underwent after their enlightenment in the thatched cottage ruins. Otherwise, even Qin Ming would have emerged bloodied, or perhaps even suffered mutual destruction with his other self in the great mist. After such a battle, he felt that the new route for the Silk Script was complete. Tested and tempered by actual combat, it became even smoother and perfectly suited him. Little Wu spat out a mouthful of blood foam, also very satisfied, and strode out.

He grinned and said, "Senior sister, swear an oath with a forbidden technique, don't speak of what you saw." Liu Hanyue's expression froze. She had long known that these two possessed great secrets; otherwise, they wouldn't have been so obscure. She took a deep breath and actually complied, because she knew very well that those two guys, despite looking harmless, were absolutely very dangerous.

Qin Ming and Little Wu didn't walk fast, still experiencing the changes within themselves.

"You two..." On Liu Hanyue's delicate face, her expression was somewhat complex. Could these be some Immortal Seeds or Divine Seeds, intentionally hiding within the team?

"Just ordinary, two nobodies. Senior sister, just pretend you saw nothing," Little Wu said.

"There's actually... a village!" Liu Hanyue exclaimed. At this moment, she was standing on a low hill, looking out. Some of the teams ahead had entered, while others bypassed it, continuing forward. Clearly, there was a divergence of opinions between the two groups. A moment later, the three of them approached.

Qin Ming was surprised, saying, "It's very quiet. Those who entered are like clay oxen entering the sea; they haven't made a single sound?" It wasn't until they reached the mist at the village's edge that they abruptly heard shouts of battle from within. Someone was fighting, and intense combat was unfolding.

"Run, hurry!" A youth collapsed. Over a dozen figures, covered in blood, struggled outwards. However, some exploded mid-journey, smashed apart by short-handled hammers thrown at them. Others screamed, pierced by thrown long spears, bleeding profusely. A tragedy was unfolding here.

"What genius disciples? Are they so fragile? Haha, the academies of the Kunlun region are nothing special!" Wolf-like laughter echoed.

"Demons!" Liu Hanyue's face changed.

Qin Ming and Little Wu immediately rushed in. Although they found some people very displeasing, when facing the demons from the plateau, they definitely had to unite against a common enemy. At this moment, Qin Ming continuously drew his bow. Immediately, on the village rooftops, some tall figures who were throwing spears and short hammers were successively struck by arrows, splattering blood. Qin Ming did not use his Jade Iron Arrows, nor did he unleash Heavenly Light Energy. The fine iron arrows, shot purely with his physical strength, achieved this effect.

"Run!" In an instant, over a dozen familiar figures rushed out. "Don't go in! There are extremely powerful demons inside. Even Xin Youdao, Gan Jincheng, and Jiang Ruoli couldn't stop them and were severely wounded!" Someone warned them not to throw their lives away. They were grateful that Shen Wubing, Wu Yaozu, and Liu Hanyue could rush in to save people, but they didn't believe it would change anything.

Qin Ming said nothing and charged inward. Xin Youdao and the others were heavily wounded but not instantly killed, which meant the demons weren't *that* terrifying. However, he soon realized he had thought too simply. Because a large group of people were actually blocked by four demons. Including the demons standing on the rooftops throwing spears and short hammers, there were fewer than ten in total. Yet, five teams, no less than fifty people, had come here and were scattered by the demons, with some killed.

With a *boom*, Little Wu hurled a long spear, which flew into the battlefield like lightning. Qin Ming continuously shot arrows, then picked up a short hammer and hurled it out with a crash, like a peal of thunder exploding. Among the four strongest demons, one had blood on his shoulder, wounded by an arrow. And some of the demons standing on the rooftops were even shot through.

"Have experts arrived?" A wolf-headed demon standing on a rooftop said. The four leading demons, however, remained silent. They stood on the ground, having temporarily stopped. All of them had human appearances, and there wasn't a single drop of blood on them before, showing how formidable they were.

"Retreat quickly!" Xin Youdao shouted to the others. After seeing Qin Ming and Little Wu, his eyes immediately lit up. There were still over twenty people here, yet even combined, they couldn't defeat those four great demons.

"Did I tell you to leave?" A silver-haired youth spoke, a demon indistinguishable from a human. With a *whoosh*, he shot out like lightning. With a *poof*, Su Junlin from the Grand Dream Dao Field was bisected by his long saber! Everyone's faces turned pale. Su Junlin was the leader of a team, very strong, yet he died such a tragic death.

At the same time, a golden-haired youth charged out, piercing Lin Qianyi with the long spear in his hand and lifting her up, making her cry out in pain. Although Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu charged forward at extreme speed, throwing short hammers and long spears, they were both blocked by the other two of the four great demons. With a *bang*, the golden-haired youth suddenly shook, flinging Lin Qianyi away. She crashed to the ground, clearly beyond saving, with a bloody large hole where her heart should be. This was also a genius, who had even formed a team, yet met a tragic end.

Qin Ming and Little Wu rushed closer, joining Xin Youdao and the others. "Take the others and leave first!" Qin Ming whispered. In fact, after the four young demons ceased their attack, the others fled on their own, not believing that the three reinforcements could change the tide of battle. However, the most formidable individuals, seeing Xin Youdao stay, gritted their teeth and returned. They were quite loyal, not just caring about their own escape.

Jiang Ruoli, Gan Jincheng, and Xiao Yaqin were now covered in blood, standing again in this area, gasping for breath. Soon, they were shocked. The two youths who rushed to rescue them exchanged blows with two of the four great demons and were not injured. It was precisely because of this that the four youths, who greatly resembled humans, did not pursue them further.

Xin Youdao quickly informed them: "These are four very famous young demons from the plateau, all in the Second Realm. One of them, that black-haired youth, has a very powerful background and has a chance to contend for the Demon Seed, equivalent to those who can contend for the Immortal Seed on our side. He's just a bit more polishing away from becoming truly formidable." Xin Youdao was very indignant. If his cultivation realm hadn't been low, not yet entering the Second Realm, he wouldn't have suffered such a crushing defeat today, nor such humiliation. One must realize that so many of them were hunted by just four demons, and even surrounding them was useless.

"Contend for the Demon Seed? Then he definitely won't have a chance!" Qin Ming spoke. Jiang Ruoli, Gan Jincheng, Xiao Yaqin, and the others who had returned were all startled. Was he really that confident? Daring to speak like that. Then, they immediately thought: Could it be that the two of them had truly acted earlier at the thatched cottage ruins, and it wasn't just a pretense?

"How many demons have actually entered this time? Are they deliberately waiting here to ambush?" Qin Ming asked.

Xin Youdao explained, "No, our side had already captured some areas of the plateau, and this secret realm was included. These demons were already here at the time and didn't have time to leave, so they went into hiding."

"Since that's the case, let's kill them all!" Qin Ming declared. He had spent time in the frontier of exploration, fiercely battling with some demons, and knew how terrifying old demons who had come into their own could be. These outsiders were extremely hostile towards their side, with no room for reconciliation between them.

"Two each!" Little Wu said.

The golden-haired youth on the other side spoke, "Hehe... what did I just hear? A whole group of people were defeated by us. You two are indeed not weak, but to be so arrogant, I think you're tired of living!" They actively pressured them. As four highly renowned young demons from the plateau, they were extremely confident. They had all stepped into the Second Realm, and each had a terrifying demon lineage behind them.

Qin Ming said nothing and walked forward. Little Wu immediately followed, joining him in facing the four unique youths.

"Those two..." Gan Jincheng was somewhat incredulous.

Liu Hanyue whispered, "They might win!"

"Let's also contribute and block those demons on the rooftops!" Jiang Ruoli said. Xiao Yaqin's expression was complex. She naturally understood that those two youths were very strong. When Xin Youdao had recommended them to her earlier, she had actually refused.

"We don't know your origins. Could you be candidates for the Immortal Seed? Your tone is certainly not small," the most powerful black-haired young demon said.

"Who's going up? Let's kill one first!" The black-haired youth's tone was icy. He was equivalent to a quasi-Immortal Seed; his realm hadn't reached the standard yet, but his potential was immense.

"Let me!" The silver-haired youth responded. He was the one who had bisected Su Junlin with a saber at the last moment, indeed possessing profound cultivation and being extremely brutal.

"Brother, let me..." Little Wu hadn't finished speaking when Qin Ming already charged out. The silver-haired youth, clutching his dripping long saber, approached. Seeing his opponent being more proactive and already before him, he immediately sneered. He had already stepped into the Second Realm two years ago, a prodigious talent among demons.

However, the next moment, he was horrified. A five-colored saber appeared in his opponent's hand, and five-colored light wheels rotated around his body, making his hair stand on end. This was no sparring match, but a demon hunt. Qin Ming didn't want to waste time and went all out from the start. The two collided over a dozen times in the shortest amount of time. It was conceivable how strong the silver-haired youth was, to have clashed head-on with Qin Ming, who had just completed his enlightenment, so many times. Between the two, saber light flashed dazzlingly, constantly surging upwards.

Finally, after the silver-haired youth clashed with Qin Ming again, he quickly reeled back. With a *clang*, his long saber shattered and fell to the ground. Blood then began to flow from his brow, followed by his chest and abdomen splitting open. With a *poof*, his body split into two halves, having already been bisected. Only then did blood spray everywhere!
