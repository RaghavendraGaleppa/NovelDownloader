# Chapter 255: The Ruins

In Li Shiming's spiritual perception, the rock he had just discovered was actually the floor of a plaza. As he cleared away more and more silt, the ruins revealed by his spiritual sense grew larger.

It was as if he were witnessing the destruction of a mountain sect—peaks shattered by terrifying attacks, countless buildings reduced to rubble. The entire ruin, as perceived by his spiritual sense, was nothing more than a worthless wasteland.

But then he thought of the "Spirit-Concealing Phantom Serpent." Where had such an ancient spirit beast lived? Creatures like this should have vanished long ago like other prehistoric beings unless they had a unique environment to sustain them. Since the serpent was still alive, there must be a place where it could survive.

With this thought in mind, he continued digging through the silt, hoping to uncover the serpent's habitat.

"Found it!" By the next day, Li Shiming finally made a discovery.

His excavation had been extremely cautious, wary of encountering more "Spirit-Concealing Phantom Serpents" or even more dangerous creatures. Fortunately, everything went smoothly. The presence of one serpent was enough to make the area perilous, and no second one appeared.

What he found was a silt-covered entrance, just large enough for the serpent's body to pass through. Li Shiming couldn't enter upright, but he could still squeeze through.

After a brief hesitation, he decided to explore the passage. Since this ruin of an ancient sect still had preserved spaces, there was a good chance valuable items remained. Moreover, in such a confined space, his physical strength would give him the upper hand in combat—his defense and close-quarters prowess were unmatched among Foundation Establishment cultivators.

He cleared the silt from the entrance, but the sludge inside was unavoidable. He had to wade through it. Fortunately, the serpent's frequent passage had loosened the muck, making the journey slightly easier.

Li Shiming kept his spiritual sense extended, scanning dozens of meters ahead. The tunnel was long, likely designed as an air vent or some other passageway—certainly not for human travel, given how narrow it was.

After traversing over two hundred meters, his spiritual sense detected an open space ahead. As he had guessed, the serpent's habitat lay beyond.

Li Shiming couldn't be sure if more "Spirit-Concealing Phantom Serpents" lurked within, so he slowed his pace and deployed the Nine Palaces Sword Formation ahead, forming a dense net of blades. If any serpents appeared, they would be intercepted.

But no unexpected encounters occurred. He emerged from the tunnel into a body of water. 

"Spiritual energy!" The water here was fresh, unlike the seawater outside, and rich in spiritual energy—it could even be called a spiritual spring. Looking up from beneath the surface, he saw light filtering down from above, though he couldn't tell its source.

He kept the Nine Palaces Sword Formation circling him as a precaution against ambushes. Here, in this spacious environment, he could finally use his "Lotus Steps" movement technique freely—unlike in the cramped tunnel, where it had been impossible.

When his spiritual sense breached the water's surface, what he saw sent a chill down his spine, tightening every muscle in his body. He nearly gasped aloud.

Only after confirming the absence of life energy did he relax. Emerging from the water, he saw a massive "Spirit-Concealing Phantom Serpent" on the shore—over thirty meters long. The light he had seen earlier came from its glowing eyes.

For a moment, Li Shiming thought he was doomed. Based on the size of the serpent he had killed earlier—a peak Foundation Establishment creature—this colossal serpent had to be far beyond Great Demon level, possibly even equivalent to a human Nascent Soul cultivator.

Had it been alive, Li Shiming would have been nothing more than a snack. Even now, with the serpent long dead, its corpse exuded a lingering pressure—residual energy from its formidable existence.

Emerging from the water, Li Shiming barely spared a glance at his surroundings, wholly captivated by the serpent's remains. His mind raced with possibilities—could such a corpse be refined into a puppet? The difficulty would far exceed refining a human corpse, but the potential was immense.

However, without knowing the serpent's exact cultivation level in life, he wouldn't attempt refining it yet. He also needed to weigh whether turning it into a puppet or crafting it into a treasure would be more beneficial. Such decisions were beyond his current realm—he'd need to reach Golden Core at least.

Glancing at the massive corpse and then at the tiny tunnel he'd come through, Li Shiming realized the serpent had likely been trapped here, unable to escape due to the narrow passage.

His spiritual sense wrapped around the corpse, trembling at the contact—a reflexive reaction to touching something so powerful. He didn't linger, quickly storing the serpent in his spatial ring.

With the corpse gone, the oppressive aura vanished, allowing Li Shiming to survey the area. The space plunged into darkness without the serpent's glowing eyes. He retrieved a high-powered LED light and hung it on the wall, restoring visibility.

The walls were built from jade bricks, inscribed with patterns that still shimmered despite the passage of time. When he touched them, faint spiritual energy pulsed through the engravings, protecting both the walls and the space itself.

No matter how much force he applied, the jade remained unscathed. The engravings concealed immense defensive power—destroying them would require obliterating the entire space in one strike, something far beyond Li Shiming's current abilities.

The shore near the water was devoid of large rocks, likely crushed flat by the serpent's massive body. Further in, a jade door stood slightly ajar.

Li Shiming extended his spiritual sense inside, finding a partially intact room. At its center lay a skeletal remains beside a small, glowing formation. At the formation's heart rested a translucent egg.

Detecting no danger, he entered. The skeleton's flesh and clothing had long since turned to dust, leaving only jade-like bones—a testament to the cultivator's immense power in life, far beyond Li Shiming's comprehension.

His gaze fell on a ring beside the skeleton—a spatial ring. Retrieving it with his spiritual sense, he probed inside. The ring's owner had long perished, so there was no resistance.

Most of the contents—spiritual herbs and pills—had lost their potency over time, rendered useless. Two spiritual treasures remained: a flying sword and an umbrella, both severely depleted and requiring prolonged nurturing in a spiritual-rich environment to recover.

Li Shiming focused on three ancient jade slips, different from modern ones, with no outward indication of their contents. Placing the first against his forehead, he sensed its information and smiled.

It contained the "Five Rhythms Qi Cultivation Art"—a complete version, spanning from Qi Refining to ascension. This wasn't his first encounter with such a high-level technique; his clone, Li Yuanba, cultivated the "Sword Intent Soaring Art," which also led to ascension.

Crucially, Li Shiming could practice the "Five Rhythms Qi Cultivation Art." Comparing its Qi Refining section to the "Five Elements Absorption Art" he had used, he noted striking similarities—as if the latter had been adapted from the former, perhaps modified by a descendant for a Five Spiritual Roots disciple.

Given the state of his spiritual lake, Li Shiming could skip the Qi Refining section and directly practice the Foundation Establishment portion. The "Five Rhythms Qi Cultivation Art" was highly compatible, allowing concurrent cultivation with other techniques like his "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art." He could switch his primary focus to the former upon reaching Golden Core.

The only complication was the discrepancy between the manual's descriptions and his spiritual lake's condition—his "Five Elements Absorption Array" formation, derived from second-grade materials, was an anomaly. But since it was already part of his foundation, he would continue refining it with higher-grade materials as he advanced.

The second jade slip contained the "Nine Melodies Insect Scripture," detailing the rearing of "Spirit-Concealing Phantom Serpents." The massive serpent had been the ancient cultivator's spirit beast. Before death, the cultivator released it from its contract and placed several eggs in a formation atop a spiritual vein, ensuring the serpents would guard his remains for eternity.

The serpents, whether the original or its offspring, never strayed, faithfully protecting the skeleton. Li Shiming was fortunate to arrive now—had the colossal serpent still lived, he wouldn't have stood a chance. Even now, only his "Lotus Steps" technique had saved him from the smaller serpent's attacks.

"So this is the serpent's egg," Li Shiming murmured, examining the formation's sole remaining egg. The system ensured only one egg would hatch after the previous serpent's death, inheriting its guardian instincts.

Recalling the scripture's methods, Li Shiming drew a third-grade sword base, suppressed his skin's spiritual defenses, and cut his arm. With his "Flawless Dao Body," only deliberate effort could breach his defenses. He smeared a drop of blood essence on the egg and drew a complex contract sigil with spiritual energy.

The egg absorbed both, establishing a soul link. The life inside, previously dormant, began absorbing spiritual energy in earnest. Hatching would take time.

The third jade slip contained the "Five Elements Great Dao." If the "Five Rhythms Qi Cultivation Art" was a practical manual, this was the theoretical foundation of the Five Elements—so profound that even with IBMz15's aid, Li Shiming could barely grasp a fraction.
