# Chapter 697: Reunion with an Old Friend

Suddenly, a respectful report came from outside the palace from a mountain-guarding disciple.

"Reporting to True Lord, there is a cultivator named Chu Chengnan requesting an audience at the mountain gate. He claims to be an old acquaintance of the True Lord."

"Chu Chengnan?"

Inside the main hall of the Divine Thunder Palace, the high dome seemed to hold a river of stars. Purple-gold thunder dao patterns flowed faintly between the jade pillars and the ground, exuding a profound dao charm.

Xu Yunfan, clad in a dao robe embroidered with purple-gold thunder patterns, sat high upon the cloud platform. His aura was as deep and stable as an abyssal sea, his gaze calm.

He had just emerged from deep contemplation regarding the deductions of the Samsara Sea of Bitterness. With a slight movement of his spiritual sense, he sensed the familiar yet somewhat apprehensive aura outside the mountain gate.

Soon, under the respectful guidance of the mountain-guarding disciple, a figure stepped into this magnificent and solemn hall.

The visitor wore a simple black robe. His facial features vaguely retained the contours of the past, but the vicissitudes and composure between his brows far surpassed those of bygone days. It was indeed Chu Chengnan, who had weathered tribulations and returned to the dao path.

His steps were steady, yet his eyes could not hide his complex emotions. His gaze swept quickly over the hall's simple yet thunder-dao-imbued layout, finally landing on the figure sitting on the cloud platform with an abyssal aura.

The former Junior Brother Xu was already a distant memory; now, he had become the True Lord position Chu Chengnan longed for day and night.

Chu Chengnan took a deep breath and stopped ten zhang away from the cloud platform without hesitation. He knelt on both knees and touched his forehead to the ground, performing the grand ceremony of a disciple paying respects to a Peak Master True Lord within the Primordial Origin Sect. His voice carried a hint of uncontrollable excitement and utter reverence.

"Disciple Chu Chengnan greets the Divine Thunder True Lord! May the True Lord enjoy eternal immortal fortune and have a long-lasting dao!"

The voice echoed in the empty hall, making the atmosphere even more solemn.

*He's quite the smooth talker.*

*Disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect are best at this.*

*Every single one of them has a particularly flattering tongue.*

Muttering inwardly, Xu Yunfan's calm gaze fell upon the respectful figure below, and his spiritual sense swept over him.

He was at the Foundation Establishment perfection realm, with a solid and thick foundation. It was even more condensed than before he lost his Way of the Unmoving Mountain Dao Fruit back in the day. It seemed that over the past century or so, he had not given up but had instead climbed a level higher through tempering.

However, the twilight aura on his body was already prominent. Chu Chengnan's lifespan was running out, and after five cycles of reincarnation, he was nearing the end of his life.

"Rise and speak."

Xu Yunfan's voice was calm, and a gentle yet immense force lifted Chu Chengnan steadily to his feet.

Chu Chengnan stood up as instructed, hands clasped respectfully, not daring to look directly at the cloud platform. He organized his words and spoke with gratitude and reminiscence.

"True Lord, I have boldly requested an audience today solely to express my gratitude for the True Lord's past grace of rebirth. Back then, I was arrogant and ignorant, suffered a calamity, my cultivation base plummeted, and my dao path was almost severed. If not for the True Lord's assistance back then, and the hope given when I was in despair, I would never have been able to return to the Foundation Establishment perfection realm!"

He paused, his tone becoming even more sincere. "In the past, I took the liberty to assist the True Lord's cultivation with my meager resources. Those minor resources are nothing but a drop in the ocean compared to the True Lord's achievements today. However, the True Lord remembers old relationships and protects the old acquaintances of Divine Thunder Peak, extending grace widely. Although this junior's cultivation is still low, my sincere heart can be witnessed by heaven and earth. I beg the True Lord to accept me, allowing this disciple to return to the ranks of Divine Thunder Peak and serve like a dog or horse! Even if I am to be an outer gate steward, sweeping the mountain gate, I would do so willingly and without complaint!"

These words were heartfelt and true, expressing Chu Chengnan's desire to submit. He knew clearly that in a place like the Primordial Origin Sect where the strong prey on the weak, the protection of a newly ascended True Lord was a rare treasure. The other party was exactly in need of combatants.

Especially since Xu Yunfan had obtained the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit at a startling speed and had recently joined forces with True Lord Dongming to divide the Atila World. He was currently at the peak of his popularity, and Divine Thunder Mountain was flourishing. Attaching himself to Xu Yunfan meant not only safety but also a slim chance to glimpse the Golden Core Dao path again.

Xu Yunfan looked at the respectful Chu Chengnan below, his thoughts stirring. Back then, Chu Chengnan had been abandoned by True Lord Qingyuan, and before leaving, he had given Xu Yunfan a large batch of cultivation resources. Those spirit stones, pills, and materials had indeed alleviated immense pressure when Xu Yunfan's cultivation was low and he was struggling to survive. They saved him a great deal of time collecting resources, allowing him to focus more on improving his cultivation. Xu Yunfan remembered this favor.

"Brother Chu."

Xu Yunfan spoke again, his voice still calm but with a hint of imperceptible warmth. "Regarding the past, you did indeed help me. That you were able to walk out of the valley and return to the dao path relied on your own perseverance and heart for the dao. That you have returned is very good."

Hearing this, Chu Chengnan's body trembled slightly, and immense joy and excitement flashed in his eyes. He almost knelt down again. "Thank you for your great kindness, True Lord! Chengnan will surely do his utmost to live up to the True Lord's expectations!"

"Rise."

Xu Yunfan raised his hand slightly, and the gentle force always supported him. "Currently, Divine Thunder Mountain is in need of personnel, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt. Since you have returned to Foundation Establishment perfection with a foundation surpassing the past, you may, along with the other outer gate steward elders, assist in handling the internal affairs of the peak. Cultivate diligently in your daily life and stabilize your foundation. In the Primordial Origin Sect, realm is paramount. Attaining the Golden Core at an early date is the right path."

Thinking for a moment, Xu Yunfan continued, "You cultivate the Mountain Suppressing Demon Scripture, practice the Myriad Mountains and Peaks Art, and seek the Unmoving Mountain Dao Fruit. Do you have any clues now?"

Chu Chengnan said solemnly, "I have already refined the Immortal Gold Nature and am only waiting for an opportunity."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly. Chu Chengnan was being open about this, which made Xu Yunfan feel quite comfortable. If Chu Chengnan had been evasive, Xu Yunfan would have accepted him, but he definitely wouldn't have paid much attention to him.

After all, Chu Chengnan had failed in his impact on the Golden Core before, his dao foundation had been shattered and then remade. His potential might not be as good as the past, but his seasoned experience and Foundation Establishment perfection cultivation gave him a great hope of obtaining the position.

"Good. When you are about to prove the fruit, you may speak to me. For the coming days, you shall stay on Divine Thunder Mountain."

This verbal promise, coming from a True Lord, was already a great grace. Chu Chengnan was naturally overjoyed. "Yes! I shall strictly abide by the True Lord's decree! Chengnan will surely fulfill his duties diligently and not slack off!"

Chu Chengnan's voice trembled. A heavy stone in his heart finally fell, filled with the relief and gratitude of being recognized. This time, appearing here, he had taken a risk. If Xu Yunfan had rejected him without remembering old affections, then the moment he stepped out of the gates of Divine Thunder Mountain, quite a few enemies would likely have come looking for him.

"There is indeed one matter to handle later. After it is done, you may attempt to seek the Golden Core and prove the Dao."

The Unmoving Mountain Dao Fruit ranks in the middle to lower tier among the 108 Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend Dao Fruits. It belongs to the Earth element, neither the highest nor the lowest among the five elements. But once proven, it is still a Golden Core.

"Yes!"

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, signaling that he could withdraw.

Chu Chengnan bowed again, then respectfully stepped back a few steps and turned to leave the Divine Thunder Palace hall. His steps were much lighter.

Sunlight outside the hall fell upon him, reflecting his slightly reddened eyes. It was the relief of seeing the light of dawn after enduring hardships.

Chu Chengnan's return was just a small episode within Divine Thunder Mountain.
