# Chapter 331: What Comes After the Ninth Realm?

On the arena of the Seventy-Two Districts, the originally boisterous battlefield had fallen into an eerie silence.

Everyone's gaze was drawn to the Xuanhuang light pillar piercing the heavens in the distance.

On the arena platform where the light poured down, a figure could vaguely be seen sitting cross-legged in the void. The Xuanhuang Qi enveloping him grew increasingly dense, coiling like dragons and snakes, condensing without dispersing.

It was Xu Yunfan, who was undergoing the Xuanhuang body refinement and charging toward the Ninth Realm!

What was even more terrifying was that his true qi was rapidly manifesting around him. The Ten Extremes True Qi surged like rivers and torrents.

The Golden Marrow of Buddhism, the Void Clarity of the Sword Pavilion, the Pure Yang of the Dao Sect, the True Dragon and Tiger... All these various schools of thought actually fused perfectly within his body, transforming into an unprecedented, formidable power!

"True qi, it's true qi! The Ninth Realm of Qi Refining, the Supreme Grandmaster! How could a Supreme Grandmaster of the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining appear here?"

Below the arena, an experienced veteran martial artist cried out involuntarily, his voice trembling.

The Ninth Realm was a supreme realm that countless martial artists dreamed of. Once stepped into it, it meant truly standing at the peak of the martial path, capable of looking down upon the entire martial world, and even influencing the destiny of a nation!

And Xu Yunfan, right before everyone's eyes, had shattered his shackles and achieved the status of a Supreme Grandmaster!

"Could it be that such a figure has some peculiar hobby, actually coming to this place to fight in the arena..."

"There must be details we don't know about inside. Perhaps that yellow light pillar was obtained from the arena."

However, in the next instant after his breakthrough.

*Clang!*

A piercing sound of something tearing through the air suddenly ripped across the sky!

From deep within the Jade Capital, in the direction of the Imperial City Division, a pitch-black long spear shot forth like a meteor piercing the sun. Carrying an overwhelming killing intent, it went straight for Xu Yunfan!

On the spear shaft, nine blood-colored patterns lit up one after another, accompanied by a pure and extreme killing intent surging forward!

This spear was clearly aiming to strangle Xu Yunfan while he was in the midst of his breakthrough!

"You dare?!!"

As the spear flew forth, a furious roar echoed through the heavens, shaking the very air.

"Such audacity!"

A cold shout erupted. At the edge of the arena, the protector Bi Sheng, who had been standing silently and watching the battle, suddenly looked up, a sharp, cold light flashing in his eyes.

His body did not move, but the rust-covered iron sword in his hand was suddenly unsheathed!

*Zheng!*

The sword's hum was like a dragon's roar. The rusted sword, facing the wind, spewed forth a three-inch sword light. The mottled rust on the sword's body glimmered with faint light, vaguely revealing the brilliant, starry river-like blade beneath.

Although this sword had fallen in rank due to the passage of time, it was still a divine weapon of the Eighth Tier. In Bi Sheng's hands, its sharpness was finally revealed to some extent!

*Boom!*

The sword light and the spear's radiance collided in mid-air. A terrifying wave of energy exploded, and the stone slabs of the arena within a hundred zhang radius shattered piece by piece. The surrounding martial artists were all forced back, and those with slightly weaker cultivation even spat blood and stumbled to the ground.

"An old dog from the Imperial City Division dares to interfere in the affairs of my Dao Sect?"

Bi Sheng sneered, his iron sword twisting in his hand. The sword's momentum was like a celestial river pouring down, aiming straight for the source of the spear.

"Hmph! A Seventh Tier divine weapon that has fallen in rank, and you dare to block me?"

From the direction of the Imperial City Division, a cold and sinister voice sounded. Then, a figure in a black robe stepped through the air and arrived. He raised his hand and recalled the divine spear, its tip pointing directly at Bi Sheng.

"Bi Sheng, you cannot protect him! Attempting to steal the Dragon Vein's terrestrial energy of the Great Zhou, he is doomed to die. Not only will he die, but your Dao Sect will also not have a good end."

This was touching the foundation of the Great Zhou. As long as one was part of the Great Zhou's system, no one could tolerate it.

"Want to try?"

Bi Sheng grinned, his eyes burning with fighting spirit. In the next moment, his iron sword swept across the air, its light like a rainbow, and he instantly locked into a fierce battle with the black-robed man.

Xu Yunfan glanced at Bi Sheng not far away, who was dueling an extremely old Ninth Realm expert from the Imperial City Division. Seeing that Bi Sheng was handling things with ease, he paid no further attention.

The martial path of this world is divided into the Nine Realms.

The first eight realms are the path of the mortal world, focused on tempering the physical body, refining qi and blood, and opening the meridians.

A martial artist who has cultivated to this level can already split mountains and crack stones, walk upon waves, and even, like Dugu Jiu, extend their life by several hundred years through various secret martial arts and treasures, reaching a realm unimaginable to ordinary people.

However.

The Ninth Realm is a chasm.

Those who step into this realm have true qi generated within them naturally. With a mere lift of their hand or a movement of their feet, they can draw upon the power of heaven and earth, truly transcending the mundane.

But what is strange is that from ancient times to the present, all the cultivation methods concerning the realms after the Ninth Realm seem to have been wiped away by an invisible hand, leaving only fragmented legends.

Some ancient texts record that someone broke through the shackles of the Ninth Realm, condensed their true qi into liquid, and formed a Golden Core, but there is not a single word on how to cultivate it.

Some stone carvings in secret realms show that ancient great powers could use starlight to temper their bodies, but the method has long been lost.

Some even speculate that there might be a broader world above the Ninth Realm, but all who have tried to explore it have either died an inexplicable death or vanished completely...

It is as if there is some existence in the dark, deliberately blocking this path to the heavens.

Today, Xu Yunfan, with the posture of ten thousand laws converging into one, charged into the Ninth Realm. The Ten Extremes True Qi manifesting around him faintly touched upon that long-sealed forbidden domain.

Bi Yuan went to such great lengths to use the Great Zhou's Dragon Qi to pour into his body, forging an unparalleled foundation for him. The Ten Extremes True Qi he condensed was truly perfect.

Even if Dugu Jiu stood before him, he could only sigh in admiration.

But how to nurture the true qi afterward, other than continuously circulating it within the body and absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to strengthen it, there was no other method to apply.

He looked up at Bi Sheng and the top expert from the Imperial City Division. The clash of these two Ninth Realm experts sent shockwaves throughout the entire Jade Capital!

And at the center of the arena, Xu Yunfan's breakthrough was still ongoing. Surrounded by the Ten Extremes True Qi, his aura, under the continuous infusion of Xuanhuang Qi, was still slowly rising...

The most shocked was the hidden Dugu Jiu.

This peerless swordsman who once suppressed the Imperial City with a single sword was now beginning to doubt his life, his martial heart nearly shaken.

"Ten Extremes Transforming into True? The martial path I have deduced for nearly a century, he actually cultivated it so easily..."

He couldn't help but look up at the forcibly extracted Great Zhou Dragon Vein.

"Of course, of course. Without such a miraculous method, how could one forcefully forge a flawless Ninth Realm..."

Dugu Jiu's eyes flickered, carrying a hint of caution in his heart.

The Dao Sect has existed for a much longer time than the other five top sects of the Great Zhou.

What else is hidden within it, no one knows.

Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes.

Between the flashes of golden light in his eyes, the floating stones instantly vaporized.

He suddenly understood why Bi Yuan had sent him to the Seventy-Two Districts.

This seemingly simple arena was precisely the "Dragon's Eye" of the "Kan-Li Turning Dragon Formation" in Jade Capital's terrestrial veins!

Moreover, once it was activated, the Great Zhou would have no way of ending the imperial examination even if it wanted to. If it were forcibly interrupted, this already dying true dragon would be completely suppressed, and the Great Zhou would enter an irreversible decline.

National calamity was only a matter of time. Without the continuous nourishment of the Dragon Qi, that female demon would not accept it.

As long as he continued to win from here on out, using this to build up momentum, he could naturally seize the Great Zhou's Dragon Qi from that female demon's hands.

Such a vicious move, blocking someone's path to the Dao. Even though Xu Yunfan was the beneficiary, he felt a chill run down his spine.

*(Apologies, everyone, I was held up by matters today. I will work hard tomorrow!!!)*
