# Chapter 5: The Mysterious Buddha Statue

Martial arts manuals could indeed be enhanced!

Lin Shan held the "Song Crane Art" in his hands. This cultivation technique could take one to the peak of the Houtian realm—equivalent to the pinnacle of the Transforming Jin stage—and would undoubtedly cause a frenzy if it appeared in the martial world.

The Lin Family naturally didn't withhold techniques from their outer sect disciples, but the clan's Xiantian-level techniques remained exclusively in the hands of the main lineage. While the outer sect techniques lacked offensive power, they had the benefit of prolonging life and occasionally producing first-rate experts.

Whenever a first-rate expert emerged from the outer sect, the Lin Family would recruit them as an outer sect elder. This arrangement ensured they wouldn't pose a significant threat to the main lineage, preventing any potential usurpation.

If this Song Crane Art, already capable of reaching the peak of the Houtian realm, could be enhanced...

"Xiantian! It must become a Xiantian-level technique!"

Lin Shan clenched his fists in excitement. The upper limit of a technique naturally elevated its lower bounds as well.

Xiantian techniques were vastly superior to Houtian ones in terms of qi quality, power, cultivation speed, and depth. If Lin Shan could switch to a Xiantian technique, it would dramatically accelerate his progress and lay a solid foundation for the future.

However, the Lin Family's Xiantian techniques were out of the question—Lin Shan wasn't the clan leader's son, so there was no way they would be passed to him.

"Enhancing from Houtian to Xiantian requires 4 points..."

Lin Shan began calculating how to obtain more ancient essence. The "Spring River and Mandarin Ducks" painting had yielded 5 points, leaving him with 3 remaining.

A Xiantian technique was now within reach.

...

Half an hour later, at the family's External Affairs Hall.

"Reporting, Elder. Here is the task I've been assigned today."

Lin Shan respectfully handed his identity token to the bald middle-aged man before him, inwardly sighing at the tedious and exhausting workload of the External Affairs Hall. No wonder this elder had gone bald before even turning forty.

The elder glanced at the task token labeled "Pawnshop Errand Runner" and, with a resigned air, made a perfunctory record before waving him off.

"Go on then."

...

Exiting the Lin estate, Lin Shan found himself on a bustling street teeming with people. Hawkers shouted their wares, and early market-goers hurried about their business.

He arrived at an antique-looking shop in the eastern district, its signboard adorned with five gilded characters:

"Lin Family Pawnshop."

One of the Lin estate's many businesses, it was the most reputable pawnshop in the vast Clearwater Prefecture.

When townsfolk needed funds for property or trade, they would bring their treasured gold, silver, jade, or antique heirlooms to mortgage at the pawnshop.

The shop employed experienced and professional appraisers to authenticate items, so most pawned goods were genuine. For now, this was the most convenient place Lin Shan could think of to find antiques.
