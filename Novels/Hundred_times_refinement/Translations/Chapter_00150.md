# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 98: Sea Dragon Pavilion  

Lin Xuan was inwardly surprised but maintained a calm expression. As soon as he entered the market, a young man approached him, bowing respectfully. "Greetings, Immortal Master!"  

"Mm." Lin Xuan nodded.  

"May I ask if you're here to purchase materials, elixirs, or talismans?"  

Lin Xuan paused. "You have all of those here?"  

"Of course." The young man nodded, a trace of pride flashing across his face, though his tone remained deferential. "Our Sea Dragon Sect’s market is the largest within a thousand miles. While we can’t claim to have everything, we carry about eighty to ninety percent of what Immortal Masters at the Foundation Establishment and Qi Refinement stages might need."  

The boast was bold, but Lin Xuan felt a flicker of joy. This was indeed incomparable to what Yanzhou could offer. After a brief consideration, he said, "Take me to the largest shop that sells alchemy materials."  

"Of course, please follow me."  

The young man led Lin Xuan through a series of pavilions and winding corridors until they arrived before a resplendent, golden building.  

Strictly speaking, the entire market was one massive structure, but it was ingeniously composed of countless interconnected buildings. Yet, the pavilion before them was the most magnificent of them all, adorned with a grand plaque that read: "Sea Dragon Pavilion."  

Undoubtedly, this was the Sea Dragon Sect’s own establishment.  

"Immortal Master, please!"  

The moment Lin Xuan stepped inside, he was taken aback. Behind the counters were shelves filled with all manner of talismans, spiritual tools, and cultivation materials.  

A rough estimate suggested there were at least a dozen spiritual tools on display—mostly low-grade, but the sheer number casually laid out was astonishing.  

A plump man who looked like the shopkeeper approached and clasped his hands in greeting. "Fellow Daoist, you must be an outsider, just arrived from Yanzhou?"  

Lin Xuan tensed immediately. How did this man know his origins? Though he was certain the Fire Spirit Sect’s influence didn’t extend here, he subtly gathered his spiritual energy in preparation.  

"Ah, no need for alarm," the man said with a genial smile. "Only cultivators from Yanzhou would be surprised by what they see here."  

Lin Xuan remained expressionless. "I’d like to hear your reasoning."  

"If you’re willing to listen, I’ll gladly explain."  

After the time it took to burn an incense stick, Lin Xuan lowered his guard. The man had deduced his background simply from his reaction upon entering.  

From the shopkeeper’s explanation, Lin Xuan realized that Yanzhou’s cultivation world was far more backward than he had imagined—not just in terms of overall cultivation levels but also in the scarcity of cultivation materials.  

Take spiritual tools, for example. In Yanzhou, only elite disciples of major sects or those at the Foundation Establishment stage typically possessed them.  

But in Youzhou, even Qi Refinement cultivators at the fourth layer often owned one—albeit low-grade—highlighting the disparity between the two regions.  

Thus, local cultivators wouldn’t bat an eye at the sight of so many spiritual tools on display. Only those from Yanzhou would be visibly stunned.  

Lin Xuan nodded in understanding.  

It seemed the intelligence he’d gathered from the Floating Cloud Valley’s elders and senior disciples was incomplete. He needed to quickly familiarize himself with Youzhou’s cultivation world to integrate smoothly.  

"By the way, Fellow Daoist, what do you need here?" The shopkeeper remained professional, showing no disdain despite Lin Xuan’s "backwater" origins.  

"Do you have any books on alchemy?"  

"Alchemy manuals?" The man pondered. "We do, but they’re mostly introductory. Advanced ones are..."  

"Introductory is fine."  

Even though he was refining a supreme-grade elixir, the Marrow-Cleansing Pill was the most basic in the cultivation world. Moreover, secondary refinement was simpler than standard alchemy, so an introductory manual would suffice.  

"Please wait a moment." The shopkeeper called over a young attendant and gave some instructions. The boy bowed and hurried off.  

"He’ll fetch the manual you need. Is there anything else?"  

"Do you have Earthfire Talismans?"  

The shopkeeper showed no surprise at Lin Xuan’s request, instead nodding knowingly. "I see you plan to refine pills. Our Earthfire Talismans are crafted by the Sea Dragon Sect’s Foundation Establishment experts—affordable and of excellent quality."  

After examining the samples, Lin Xuan was pleased. Things were even easier than he’d expected, thanks to Youzhou’s advanced cultivation standards. The market’s abundance of materials allowed cultivators to trade freely. In Yanzhou, procuring these items would have been far more troublesome.  

However, his joy was short-lived. The Earthfire Talismans were exorbitantly priced, and refining pills would require many of them. Fortunately, he had acquired a stash of mid-grade spirit stones from Qingling Zhenren’s storage pouch. But after purchasing the talismans, his funds were nearly depleted.  

"By the way, Fellow Daoist, you’re planning to refine mid-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills, aren’t you?"  

Lin Xuan stiffened slightly but kept his expression neutral. "How did you know?"  

"Given that you’re at the peak of Qi Refinement, you must be aiming to refine mid-grade pills to attempt a breakthrough to Foundation Establishment."  

At these words, even Lin Xuan’s composure nearly faltered. Normally, cultivators of the same realm could only discern each other’s cultivation level by using the Spirit Eye Technique—a practice considered impolite in the cultivation world. Yet, he hadn’t sensed the shopkeeper using it. How, then, did the man know he was at the peak of Qi Refinement?  

"Ah, no need for surprise," the shopkeeper chuckled. "The old Spirit Eye Technique required active use to inspect another’s cultivation. But the improved version now allows cultivators of the same realm to automatically discern each other’s level at a glance—no activation needed. We have the manual here. Just one hundred spirit stones. Interested?"  

"One hundred spirit stones?"  

Lin Xuan’s expression froze. That was practically daylight robbery! Still, Youzhou’s cultivation world was undeniably advanced to have refined even the simplest auxiliary technique like this. Its utility in daily life was immense.  

"Is this for real?"  

"Of course. Our Sea Dragon Pavilion’s goods may be slightly pricier, but their quality is guaranteed. We don’t deceive fellow cultivators with fakes."  

Hearing this, Lin Xuan smiled slightly, his impression of the man improving. A higher price was acceptable if the product was worth it. "Let me see the Spirit Eye Technique manual first."
