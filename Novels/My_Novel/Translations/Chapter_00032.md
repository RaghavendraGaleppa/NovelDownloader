Chapter 32: Fist Technique Mastery, Internal Qi Doubles!

After every guard competition, the lists of those promoted and those who failed are displayed in the courtyard for everyone to see.

In the promotion list, the prefix before "Li Xian" changed from [Ding] to [Bing].

This announced that he had become a Bing-level guard. Even among the guards, this was no longer a low level.

There were over three hundred Ding-level guards, mostly aged between twenty and forty.

By the time one reached Bing-level guard, the number dropped sharply to just over forty. Not only were the benefits better, but when sent on external missions, they were squad leaders who could obtain even more benefits.

"You have already practiced two fist techniques. With this promotion, you can choose a basic martial art. I suggest you choose a 'leg technique'."

Li Xian had always been a lone wolf in the manor. Although his status had been promoted, there was no one to share the joy with. Instead, he took a copy of "Breeze Leg Technique" and returned to his small residence.

Pang Long's words flashed through his mind.

This leg technique was recommended by Pang Long. At the time, Pang Long had also said:

"When martial artists practice martial arts, they inevitably have strengths and weaknesses. But that is a matter for old fogies. As a beginner like you, you should try more things and not limit yourself too early."

"Choosing another fist technique, while allowing you to gain insight from others and quickly enter the gate or even achieve mastery, is ultimately just adding flowers to the brocade."

"Switching to a leg technique, although the initial practice will be difficult, the benefits will be greater."

Li Xian felt this made a lot of sense.

Although this "Breeze Leg" is a basic martial art, it has its own unique points.

Practicing it not only strengthens the leg technique and lower stance but also significantly increases foot speed!

"I am now a Bing-level guard."

"My patrol time has decreased, and my rest time has increased. It changed from seven patrols a day to four patrols a day. I suddenly have three extra hours."

"I have plenty of time now. Practicing an extra martial art is just right!"

After skimming through the Breeze Leg technique and memorizing the general idea, Li Xian didn't rush to practice immediately.

He first went to the Food Pavilion to eat a "Bing-level meal" and enjoy the benefits of being a Bing-level guard.

"Old... Li Xian, congratulations."

Wang Chun had just heard the news of Li Xian's promotion and didn't expect to run into him right in front of the Food Pavilion. He greeted him with a face full of embarrassment.

"嗯, it was just luck." Li Xian nodded.

Wang Chun lowered his head and walked past, joining Zhao Han, Zhuo Yilie, and the others.

The three of them whispered privately, discussing something. Li Xian only glanced at them淡淡ly and didn't bother to talk to them.

"This manor... from top to bottom, is ultimately a place that devours people."

"The three of them originally hated and resented me. Now that I've been promoted to Bing-level, they seem to have lost much of their resentment."

Li Xian could clearly feel the change in their attitude. It wasn't just Zhao Han and the other two, but also many of the Ding-level guards.

The Bing-level meal included beef and mutton, rich in oil and fat, all good meats for restoring Qi and blood.

Today's dishes were three meat dishes and two vegetable dishes. Martial artists expend a great deal of Qi and blood when practicing, so meat is indispensable.

After eating and drinking his fill, he was full of energy.

The next day.

Li Xian began to practice the Breeze Leg. The first step was to follow the leg manual and imitate it.

According to the leg technique, he first took a large iron basin and filled it with water. He tied large bricks to his feet and stepped on the edge of the iron basin.

Keeping his waist still, he used the strength of his ankles to make the iron basin rotate, causing the water in the basin to form a gentle vortex.

The vortex wasn't the bigger the better; on the contrary, the smaller the better. When he could quickly twist the iron basin without the water inside forming a vortex, he could start practicing how to kick.

"After the Breeze Leg is achieved to Minor Success, the legs are like a breeze, able to tread on grass without a trace and kick a person without injury, but the damage penetrates the surface and reaches the inside."

"The realm of 'Food Essence' that Commander Pang mentioned, I don't know when I'll be able to touch it. But this body of mine is already much stronger than before."

Among the many guards, many martial arts overlap.

Just like the Breeze Leg, over twenty Ding-level guards know it. But most are only at the level of entering the gate to mastery.

As long as one masters a basic martial art to the "Minor Success" realm, it is almost inevitable to enter the Bing level, as the guard competition is held once a month.

Sometimes, if the opponent is slightly weaker and luck is slightly better, one can be promoted. As long as one is willing to spend time grinding.

"Commander Pang said... Bing-level guards, as long as they are diligent and self-disciplined, can all cross the threshold. But for Yi-level guards, some talent is needed."

"The goal of a martial artist is to be reborn, to wash away the clay body. But the process is not easy. Before the age of twenty-seven or twenty-eight, if one cannot accumulate Internal Qi to the point of 'Qi Circulating the Small Heavenly Cycle'."

"Internal Qi cannot nourish the physique, and Qi and blood will begin to flow away through the cracks. This leads to the decline of bodily functions."

"It becomes even more impossible to reach that 'Food Essence' realm."

"But what exactly is Qi Circulating the Small Heavenly Cycle? Is it that Internal Qi has accumulated to a certain extent?"

Li Xian banished distracting thoughts and focused on practicing his legs.

Two hours passed in a flash. With a "splash," Li Xian fell out of the iron basin. Water splashed out, soaking his clothes.

Li Xian got angry too. He took off his upper garment and stood in the iron basin again, using the twisting force of his ankles to gradually drive the iron basin to spin. As it spun, the vortex grew larger and harder to control.

Just as he was about to fail.

Li Xian suddenly had a flash of inspiration: "When I carried water before, I knew how to use force to eliminate the water's impact in the bucket, saving effort."

"Is the principle the same? It's worth a try anyway, since my clothes are already wet."

He applied the technique of [Carrying Water] to the Breeze Leg. It worked as expected; the water vortex gradually shrank and finally dissipated completely.

[You have grasped the practice method of the Breeze Leg Technique.]

[Breeze Leg]

[Proficiency: 1/500 Entry]

With the prompt from his Heavenly Dao Rewards Diligence destiny, Li Xian's mind was shaken, and a sense of accomplishment arose involuntarily.

[Skill: Weeding], [Skill: Carrying Water], [Skill: Running], [Skill: Eating], [Bull Strength Fist], [Four Directions Fist]...

Now, another [Breeze Leg] has been added.

"Once I have mastered all the martial arts I have obtained to their limits!"

"I should be able to carve out a small place for myself in this world, right? No longer needing to live under someone else's roof."

"No matter how good being a guard is, it's ultimately being a servant. What others can give, others can take back. Only what belongs to oneself is unshakable!"

Li Xian thought silently to himself.

Guard competitions are usually held at the end of the month. A couple of days after the competition, it arrived at the beginning of the tenth month.

On this day.

Li Xian was practicing his fist technique.

Although he had a new love in [Breeze Leg], [Four Directions Fist] had not lost its favor.

With a punch, his whole body shook slightly. A red flush spread from within, and a warm current continuously sprouted from his limbs and bones.

Flowing towards every part of his body, Li Xian's breathing became hot, and white mist enveloped his entire face.

[Four Directions Fist]

[Proficiency: 1/5000 Great Success]

[Description: Fist technique Great Success, Qi flows through the whole body, the body is like a furnace, benefiting endlessly. Through punch after punch, you achieved Great Success in the fist, gradually grasping the true meaning of the Four Directions Fist, and seeing the initial scene of the fist technique...]

The heat in his Dantian surged like a flood, rushing ceaselessly. The scene before his eyes changed, and he actually saw a vague figure.

This is the initial scene of the fist technique, showing who created this fist technique and why.

This is a great opportunity. The scene of this initial scene often points directly to the essence of the fist technique, surpassing any teacher's transmission!

Looking at its figure, it should be a woman...

The woman extended her slender fingers and casually sketched in the air. A stroke to the left, then a stroke to the right, a stroke up and a stroke down.

Then she waved her sleeve, and that was the end.

Li Xian was stunned. He had heard Pang Long mention that the Four Directions Fist was created by "Madam." The figure in the initial scene should undoubtedly be Madam.

To create a set of fist techniques with such casual gestures...

It was simply breathtaking.

Just as he was lost in thought, a cold wind suddenly blew, giving him a shock.

Coming back to his senses, he focused his mind and felt that the Internal Qi in his Dantian had tripled!
