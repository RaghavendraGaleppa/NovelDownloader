# Chapter 85: Second Level of Body Refinement

Under the stimulation of Zhou Qing and his two companions' vital auras, the Blood Vine emerged from the water, stretching a full thirty meters long. Its vines coiled like giant serpents as sunlight gathered on the water's surface, converging toward the vine.

It was absorbing solar essence.

Zhou Qing realized this Blood Vine wasn't just feeding on flesh and blood—it could also absorb the essence of the sun and moon. Unfortunately, he wouldn't give it any more chances to grow.

Not far from Zhou Qing's group, Prefect Feng had prepared ballistae as instructed. Five ballistae, operated by military strongmen, were cranked into position, their massive arrows loaded. With the three innate masters distracting the vine, the ballistae took aim.

The trigger mechanisms of these ballistae couldn't be pulled by human strength alone. Specialized archers wielded heavy mallets, striking the triggers with full force. 

The massive arrows, with their flat chisel-shaped heads—hence called "chisel arrows"—whistled through the air toward the thick, dragon-like Blood Vine. Sensing danger, the vine reacted, but Zhi Shan and the two elders attacked simultaneously with their spears as the arrows were loosed.

One arrow pierced straight through the thick vine, followed by the elders' spears striking home. Zhou Qing marveled at the ballistae's power—even an innate master couldn't withstand such force with bare flesh. The only drawbacks were their poor accuracy and slow mobility, making them easy for innate masters to evade.

Seizing the moment, Zhou Qing wielded a military-grade cleaver, unleashing both his True Qi and Gangsha in a thunderous slash that struck the vine's thick stem. The three continued inflicting wounds relentlessly. The vine, now thirty meters long, was still clearly visible in the shallow lake.

As they dragged the vine through the water, its resistance weakened. Zhou Qing ordered the navy soldiers to attack, hacking away until the vine finally lost all vitality. 

After collecting the remains, Zhou Qing used his spiritual sense to ensure no fragments were missed. He then discovered a blood-red crystal pulsating with immense vitality—unlike any demon beast core he'd encountered. His snake and rooster companions feasted on the vine's remains, but after one meal, they refused a second, appearing listless.

Zhou Qing kept some samples for study and had the rest doused in oil and burned. The city's previous encounters with the vine's poisonous offshoots had been handled the same way—fire was its weakness.

He warned the townspeople to report any similar vines immediately to prevent casualties. With this incident, Hushan Prefecture was fully integrated into Jiangzhou's governance. Before leaving, Zhou Qing arranged for Feng Xiu, a promising young talent, to be sent to Qingfu Palace for training.

Back home, Zhou Qing documented everything he knew about the Blood Vine, storing samples in jade boxes—known for their purifying properties against evil, much like silver and gold's effects on spirits.

The blood crystal fascinated him. Its surging vitality was irresistible. When he channeled his True Qi into it, the returning energy flooded him with vigorous essence. However, as he refined it with his Five Organs Thunder Resonance, a bloodthirsty urge arose. 

"Gentle winds stir not, waves stay calm..." 

Reciting the Heart-Cleansing Mantra suppressed the killing intent. The crystal enhanced his physique but carried the risk of corruption—those with weak spiritual cultivation could easily fall into demonic savagery.

This realization sparked an idea: if other creatures like the Blood Vine produced similar crystals, they could greatly aid his body refinement. His current physique still paled compared to demon beasts' natural resilience, but with persistent training, he could surpass them.

Proceeding cautiously, Zhou Qing absorbed the crystal's essence while monitoring his mental state.

Later, Zhou Qing set out with his rooster and snake companions to meet Zhang Jingxiu at the snowy border. The rooster, now incredibly swift and cunning, was hard even for Zhou Qing to catch—it knew when to flee. The snake's deadly venom and agility made it equally valuable.

"You've completed your innate vitality transformation?" Zhang Jingxiu asked in surprise.

"Just fortunate circumstances. My skills still pale next to yours."

Zhang Jingxiu rolled his eyes. "Your modesty feels suspicious."

"Enough talk—let's head to the Great Snow Mountain," Zhou Qing said, cutting the banter short.

The two innate masters and the rooster infiltrated the snowfield. After witnessing the Blood Vine incident, Zhou Qing knew his allies needed to refine their spiritual cultivation to handle future threats. 

He had also spread rumors about "Yang Gong's Treasure" to locate the remaining animal hide maps left by Master Jingyang. Though he suspected Jingyang might still be alive in another realm, Zhou Qing aimed to reach the tenth level of Qi Refinement first.

Amidst the chaos of demonic resurgence, opportunities abounded. With his lifespan now extended to two hundred years, Zhou Qing had time to build his sect's foundation in Jiangzhou, generation by generation.

His vision was clear: a self-sustaining immortal sect, not just personal ascension. Collective strength would carry them further—whether against demon beasts or in uncovering secrets. 

Balancing factions—like integrating Prefect Feng as a counterweight to Jiangzhou's native groups—was essential. Even the rooster and the ancient mulberry tree were part of this growing force.

In the end, Zhou Qing knew true power came from within. Schemes mattered little without strength. 

With that, the journey continued.
