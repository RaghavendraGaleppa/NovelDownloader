# Chapter 248: Exploring the Perilous Pass, Digesting the Spirit Treasure, Pure Yang Displays Its Power

Rain drizzled on, cold and relentless, and killing intent hung heavy in the air.

Li Xian had expected his pursuers to be tenacious and that they would stick to him relentlessly. Their sudden arrival, however, was a surprise. Maintaining his composure, he hid in an alley. As a carriage passed by, he and Wen Caishang took the opportunity to hide within it, riding out of the city.

It turned out that...

Although Li Xian and Wen Caishang had gained the upper hand and were always a step ahead, the "Crimson List" was brewing, leaving clues along the way.

Tracing them was not difficult.

Catching up to them, however, was.

During this time, Su Qiuwu was at his wit's end. His vicious plan was ruthless, yet it still fell short by half. But his luck was exceptionally good. During the chase, he suddenly encountered a "Divine Constable."

A man known as the "Cold-Blooded Divine Constable," Leng Shixing. When it came to hunting down criminals and evil-doers, he was a first-rate expert. Su Qiuwu offered gifts to curry favor and explained the situation. Leng Shixing, seeing his sincerity was genuine, agreed to help. Having grown up in the Huashui Prefecture and spent years chasing fugitives, he was intimately familiar with the terrain.

He said, "Merely following clues will only ever leave you trailing in the criminal's footsteps. You must anticipate their moves and set up your layout in advance."

He then began to deduce various routes. Fleeing south or escaping north, hiding east or concealing west... He considered every possibility. Extremely familiar with the terrain of the Huashui Prefecture, he sorted through the existing clues and narrowed it down to several locations. "The Weihu River, the Qunhua Valley, the Manlin Road... These are the easiest places for a fugitive to escape through. Based on his trail, if he is smart enough, he should have fled to the Weihu River."

Su Qiuwu said, "That's strange. As far as I know, the fugitive isn't a local. How would he know about places like the Weihu River and the Qunhua Valley?"

He had been purchasing maps, setting up pursuit networks, and coordinating disciples from various sects along the way. But the maps he could acquire were limited and often inaccurate. To truly understand the many unique features of the terrain, one had to walk the paths personally.

The Weihu River was far away, and Su Qiuwu had never heard of it. Putting himself in the fugitive's shoes, he was naturally skeptical.

Leng Shixing replied, "That's why I say... if he is smart enough, he would naturally have the means to learn of these places. If he isn't smart, just fleeing blindly without a destination, you could eventually find him with your brute-force pursuit. But then there would be no need for me to step in!"

Su Qiuwu thought to himself, "That little brat is indeed formidable. If it were him, this is entirely possible!" He made up his mind to try it. Ignoring the clues along the way, he headed straight for the Weihu River. He laid out a dragnet, forming a pincer movement of encirclement.

There were three cities by the Weihu River: White Tiger City, Elephant Tiger City, and Dragon Tiger City. Beyond the cities were the towering, complex mountain ranges and the sects that dominated the region.

As soon as Su Qiuwu arrived at the city, he immediately distributed the "Crimson List." That very day, he received clues, pinpointing Li Xian's approximate location. Following Leng Shixing's orders, he set up his trap. Unbeknownst to his targets, the net was drawn tight without a single gap.

And so, the scene of today unfolded.

Li Xian remained calm, staying overnight in the wilderness. He dared not light a fire. The rain drizzled on, sticky and damp. Although Li Xian knew the direction of the Weihu River, he was unfamiliar with the surrounding terrain. To escape, understanding the layout of the land was of the utmost importance.

Seeing that night was falling, even if it meant taking a risk, he had to steal a map. Li Xian slipped out and secretly entered the nearest city. He saw that disciples were guarding the front of every bookstore.

Li Xian thought, "The world is vast, but without a map, I'm blind. Like a blind man rushing about, acting on luck alone." He realized that buying a map had become an impossible task.

So he devised another plan, using an old trick. He tracked a lone disciple, launched a sudden attack to kill him, and searched for a map. He actually found one. He immediately buried the disciple's body and returned to the wilderness to discuss the route with Wen Caishang.

The map covered an area of a hundred miles. The left bank of the Weihu River was depicted in detail: mountain distributions, vegetation, and secluded paths. But the right bank was the Tiger's Weeping Ridge, a vast, blank space.

It was rumored that only the Tiger Luo Sect and the Elephant Luo Sect possessed partial maps of the Tiger's Weeping Ridge, and they were held in the hands of the sect leaders.

Li Xian said, "I killed one of their disciples. They will soon notice. We... need to quickly choose a route to escape." Wen Caishang smiled. "You decide."

Li Xian studied the map intently, simulating the enemy's layout. He figured out several routes and wanted to leave that very night. Suddenly, he pointed to a spot. "Wait... Madam, look at the trend of this mountain range. Doesn't it seem a bit abrupt?"

Wen Caishang furrowed her brows in thought. Observing the mountain range, which rose and fell continuously, she said, "According to common sense, this path on the map should be a dead end. Yet on the map, it has become a uniquely advantageous secret path. The landscapes of the world are indeed magnificent and unpredictable, but at this moment, we must consider it carefully, for fear of falling into someone's insidious scheme."

Their eyes met. Both were master strategists, and both thought, "This map has been altered. Someone is deliberately misleading us, distributing a fake map. If we were to truly escape according to this map, we would be walking right into a trap!"

Wen Caishang said gravely, "It seems Su Qiuwu has another helper, one who is extremely skilled at tracking criminals. The pursuit is precise, and the trap is laid invisibly. If I weren't skilled in geomancy and was surrounded so tightly, in my haste, upon seeing such a secret path, I would have charged right in." Li Xian smiled. "But we are not the criminals."

Wen Caishang said, "What do you want to do? The plan to cross the river is probably difficult as well. This person knows how to alter maps and anticipates our moves, so he must be deep and cunning. He has intentionally guarded against us crossing the river. And... the Weihu River is filled with fishing boats and iron nets cast from above, making it a natural barrier. If we get caught in an iron net, it will be difficult to escape!"

The river that should have been a path to escape had become a cage of confinement. Drowned tiger corpses floated on the surface, with boats fishing from above and vicious fish gnawing from below. The river water was murky and foul-smelling, making it impossible to stay submerged for long.

Li Xian considered his options carefully. The left bank's layout was tight, the enemy was in the shadows, and there were countless iron nets in the river. It was difficult to escape. He thought, "The Tiger's Weeping Ridge is dangerous and mysterious. With ten thousand tigers rushing into the river, there must be some secret within. Heaven's luck is blocking me, so I have no choice but to take the risk!"

There was only one viable path. He said calmly, "Then let's enter the Tiger's Weeping Ridge."

The Tiger's Weeping Ridge stretched for eight hundred miles, connecting to a mysterious mountain range. That range linked the three prefectures of Huashui, Qiongtian, Chongling, and the one province of Wangyue. It stretched for tens of thousands of miles, blocking out the sun, and was extremely perilous.

The Fuhua Merchant Guild had been in business for decades. They had once encountered a暴雨 (storm) and could not travel by boat. Fearing delays, they had entered the mountains to find a path. The entire group, people and goods, vanished without a trace.

Crossing the river and entering the ridge, they saw dense trees and foliage, with a heavy, foul odor... After a long while, a feeling of nausea rose from their stomachs. Li Xian looked back at their path, but it was already hidden by the dense forest.

Li Xian pondered, "The Tiger's Weeping Ridge is extremely sinister. Entering here is a desperate move. The enemy outnumbers us, and only by doing this can we seek a chance for survival. If I am truly fated to die here, then so be it. There is no need for regret." With a firm resolve, he drew his Sinking River Sword and began to hack through the dense foliage.

They ventured more than ten miles in.

The sky grew dark, as if it were night. Ancient, robust trees pierced the heavens, blocking out the sunlight. Today, a cold rain drizzled on, the ground was muddy and frigid.

After walking for a while, Wen Caishang's face turned pale. Her feet were chilled, and her Qi and blood were originally weak, her injuries stubborn. Li Xian carried her on his back and continued on. Wen Caishang felt greatly comforted and grew even more attached to him.

He channeled Qi to his feet to resist the cold. The dim light faded further, and night had fallen. ... The ground where Li Xian stood was covered in dense,杂草 (weeds), with nowhere flat to lie down and rest. Moreover, the cold mist, though it hadn't frosted, seeped into everything, even more so than wind and snow!

Wen Caishang said, "It seems this place is very strange. Li Xian... we must be careful." Li Xian replied, "Of course."

Walking in the dark, Li Xian was unaware of the mountain's conditions. For safety's sake, he decided to pause his exploration. The ground was cold, damp, and sticky, so he jumped onto a thick tree branch.

Li Xian said with a wry smile, "Caishang, we're in a sorry state tonight. We don't even have ground to sleep on." Wen Caishang said, "In the Luanfang Mountains, we always had caves to take shelter in, able to block the wind and rain. Right now... there is nothing. We're lucky to have half a place to lean on."

Li Xian said, "You're injured. Close your eyes and get some sleep. I'll keep watch tonight." Wen Caishang felt a secret comfort. "Though Li Lang is young, he is very responsible."

The cold, wet rain wearied the spirit. Li Xian had a Pure Yang body and vigorous blood and Qi, but after forcing himself to stay awake all night, he also felt exhausted. The next day... it was still dim inside the mountains, but they could see the path ahead.

By now, they had ventured deep inside. The terrain began to change, and a "wailing" sound occasionally echoed by their ears. The sound was deep and muffled, filled with endless sorrow. It tugged at their emotions, making one want to cry uncontrollably.

Wen Caishang shouted, "Use the Ethereal Fairy Sound!" Li Xian vibrated the bones in his body, producing a crisp, tinkling sound... The feeling of sorrow was immediately reduced.

Wen Caishang said, "A martial artist's body is like the universe. The collision of bones produces a unique sound. Conversely... in the universe, certain unique terrains can also produce unique sounds. Just like the Ethereal Fairy Sound in a human body!"

"That sound we just heard was like a tiger's wailing and sorrowful cry, tugging at one's grief. Those with weaker spirits would surely commit suicide! No wonder this place... is a forbidden zone!"

The wailing sounds continued to play, making their hair stand on end. The deeper they went, the more the sinister terrain bared its fangs.

Suddenly, they saw a large, crimson flower. Its bud was incredibly vibrant, thirty feet high and thirty feet wide... extremely vivid. As the flower bud burst open... a large tiger was revealed inside. Its fur and flesh were all corroded.

The dangers of heaven and earth include its vegetation!

[You observe the heavens and earth, explore the terrain, and the digestion of the world's essence is accelerated.]

Li Xian thought, "It seems the dangers here surpass all previous ones! I truly have no confidence in surviving. Since I am destined to die anyway... let's see what is so special about this Tiger's Weeping Ridge!"

Wen Caishang was not afraid of powerful enemies, but she couldn't help but feel a slight chill when faced with the horrors of nature. After a day of walking, her heart grew heavier. Li Xian drew his bow and shot an arrow, piercing through the dense canopy.

A ray of sunlight shone diagonally, and the two of them basked in it for a moment. Until the sun vanished again, and they couldn't see their own hands in front of their faces. Li Xian carried Wen Caishang on his back, using his lightness skill to step onto a high tree branch.

He undid his clothes and wrung them hard. Water gushed out with a "哗啦啦" sound. Li Xian said, "The rain isn't heavy, but it's incredibly damp, specifically seeping into our clothes." Wen Caishang took off her clothes, her skin fair and smooth. She wrung them hard, and water droplets fell.

Wen Caishang took off her boots. Sweat and mist were mixed within, enough to pour water out. She was originally flawless, but having suffered serious injuries and been invaded by external evil, she now resembled an ordinary woman, her pretty face flushing slightly. Li Xian said, "My Pure Yang body is exceptionally warm. I'm much drier than you."

Wen Caishang嗔道 (said coquettishly), "Are you trying to make me envy you?" Though they shared hardships, she was still a woman. They each undid their clothes to squeeze out the water and hung them on the branches to dry.

Wen Caishang's chest wrap was surprisingly dry. It was exquisitely embroidered with a phoenix soaring to the heavens. A淡金透红 (light gold through red) color, it was woven from silkworm silk. Though she was unmarried, her experiences were deep and rich. Her private clothing had its own charm, surprisingly bold and alluring.

The mist shrouded them, and the cold rain never ceased. Their clothes, boots, and socks grew wetter the more they dried, so they had no choice but to put them back on.

The tree branch was very thick, covered in moss and wild fungi... That night, they did not sleep soundly. They leaned against each other, resisting the cold in the forest. Wen Caishang thought that the Pure Yang body was indeed warm, so she leaned in a little closer.
