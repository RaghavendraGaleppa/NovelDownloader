Chapter 115: Man Can Defy Heaven, the Clay Shell Seeks to Shed

The next day.

The One Union Manor opened the cauldron to cook. A piece of dark, black "refined meat" was placed into the great cauldron.

It was said that this meat came from the nape of a thousand-year-old turtle, the size of a palm, chilling to the touch when held.

Plenty of cold water was poured in.

The lid was closed. Dragon Roar Charcoals were arranged neatly, stacked in a triangular pyramid. The charcoal was lit, and before long, the water in the cauldron began to boil.

Steam drifted out, carrying the foul, fishy stench of the "refined meat."

Covering his mouth and nose, Li Xian retreated several dozen zhang. After a good while, the foul smell gradually faded.

"Start transporting the water!" Li Xian shouted, channeling his Qi.

Ding Hu ran out of the manor, shouting with all his might, "The Commander has given the order, start transporting the water!"

"Be quick about it."

The long-prepared "black line" of people instantly moved into action, running back and forth to transport buckets of water.

The scorching sun blazed down, making the people look like ants.

After several rounds of boiling, Li Xian’s status had changed from a laborer to a guard, and then from a guard to a Commander. Those laborers who had sold themselves along with him were still laborers to this day, and some had already become dried bones.

The laborers formed a line, using their bodies as fuel and as a channel.

Seeing that everything was on track, Li Xian left Ding Hu in charge of watching over things and departed.

The inner courtyard.

It was a scene of peaceful tranquility.

Madam Wen dressed simply, wearing a long silk skirt, her long hair tied up and fixed with a jade hairpin. Her graceful figure and moving beauty needed no deliberate adornment.

In the fish pond, fish gathered, fighting fiercely for food.

Madam Wen pinched a few fish pellets and tossed them into the pond. A colorful, strange fish leaped high, swallowing the pellets into its belly.

The bag holding the fish food was made of silk, inlaid with gold thread and jade strands.

Li Xian asked for guidance:

"Madam, every time the cauldron is opened to boil the refined food, the water is transported like this. Isn't it very troublesome?"

Madam Wen was still feeding the fish. She seemed to enjoy this pastime very much. She could have simply scattered the food to let the fish eat their fill, but she always pinched a few grains, making the fish fight and scramble for them.

But she had heard Li Xian's words. After a long while, she replied, "Are you referring to the matter of the laborers transporting the water?"

Li Xian suggested, "Isn't this method too inefficient? Why not dig a water channel to divert the source to the side of the manor?"

Madam Wen raised an eyebrow. "You have quite the idea, but it won't work."

"You have just stepped onto the path of martial arts and do not know the intricacies. But I am leisurely today and in a good mood, so it wouldn't hurt to explain it to you."

Li Xian's face lit up with joy.

Madam Wen flicked her toe, sending a fish that had leaped out of the pond while fighting for food back into the water. The white boots embroidered with longevity flowers and birds were thus stained with some water marks, but they visibly faded away. The fabric of her clothes was extraordinary, resistant to filth.

She said, "What do you think is the most important factor in boiling a pot of refined food?" Her voice was melodious and pleasant.

Li Xian thought for a moment. "I believe there are three: the cauldron, the charcoal, and the water."

"When I boiled the Crab Treasure in Black River Village, it required a great deal of firewood, and it could burn out several black pots. Moreover, a pot of refined food required a large amount of water, poured repeatedly."

Madam Wen said, "Not bad. In Black River Village, although your conditions were crude, you managed to boil a pot of refined food and gained some insight."

"This world has clay shells, and there are also jade shells and porcelain shells. There is charcoal, and there is Dragon Roar Charcoal and Fine Fragrance Charcoal. Everything in the world has a difference in quality."

"Water is the same."

"If you dig a channel and divert river water to the manor, this water can certainly be used. But this water is already 'Water Divorced from the Vein' and 'Water Divorced from the Source,' meaning water that has left the river's vein."

"In the eyes of martial artists, it is slightly inferior to the source water of the river."

Li Xian was confused. "But when the laborers transport the water by hand, doesn't that also count as water divorced from the vein?" He felt his cultivation was insufficient to see the difference.

"Not only does it not count, the quality is actually higher." Madam Wen tapped her fingers lightly and said indifferently, "Using humans as a channel is naturally better than using wood as a channel. Of all things in the world, only human effort can defy heaven."

Although Li Xian did not understand, he silently committed it to memory. Thinking about it later, he felt it made a lot of sense.

Li Xian came out of the inner courtyard just at noon.

The weather in June was like an oven.

Charcoal consumption had decreased, but the demand for water had increased. The thousands of laborers were忙得不可开交 (busy as a bee), and several were already panting from exhaustion.

Li Xian, as the Commander, was ultimately merciful.

Seeing some laborers could not hold on, he let them go down and rest, sending guards to take their place, under the pretext of "training."

Guards possessed Inner Qi, so transporting water was no trouble for them.

By doing so, the number of casualties was greatly reduced. The laborers who got to rest could breathe a sigh of relief. When filling the "water transport line" again, they wouldn't be worked to death.

"Manager Luo, Madam is boiling refined food, such a major event. As the manager of the laborers, you should be leading the charge."

Li Xian's attention was drawn by Luo Fang, who was making a show of his strength and shouting noisily.

He had almost forgotten about this person.

"Oh, Com... Commander, I... I am already leading the charge, aren't I? The moment I take my eyes off these lowly wretches, they slack off." Luo Fang was both fearful and terrified.

"I said lead the charge, meaning you should go transport water too," Li Xian said calmly.

"This... this isn't appropriate," Luo Fang argued with a stiff upper lip. "If I go transport water, who will manage them? Won't it be a chaotic mess?"

"Is it hard to find someone to manage?" Li Xian swept his gaze. "Bi Hao, step out."

Luo Fang's nephew, Bi Hao, scrambled over, bowing and scraping. "Commander Li, Commander Li, you called for me?" He kowtowed, worshipping Li Xian like a god, showing more loyalty than to his uncle.

"I want your uncle to transport water, but if he goes, there will be no one to manage. I was thinking you have learned well from your uncle, how about you manage?" Li Xian said.

"Sure, sure!" Bi Hao was moved to tears. At this moment, he wished he could stab Luo Fang twice to show his loyalty to Li Xian and earn a second glance.

"I will not show favoritism! Commander Li, rest assured that you have entrusted this task to me!"

"I know you are kind-hearted, I understand the limits."

Bi Hao knocked his head until it bled.

Luo Fang stood by with an ugly expression, trembling as he replied, "C-Commander, this seems against the rules. I... I am from the laborer's house, I shouldn't be under the guards' jurisdiction."

"Nonsense!" Bi Hao jumped up. "The Commander has spoken, and you dare argue?! You have some nerve!" He jumped up and delivered a flying kick.

He snatched the whip and swung it at Luo Fang.

"You are leading the charge, hurry up and go transport water!" Bi Hao roared.

"You ungrateful wretch!" Luo Fang was furious.

"I've put up with you for a long time, you dog Luo Fang. You dare disrespect the Commander? Today, I sever all ties with you!" Bi Hao declared loudly. He brandished the whip, aiming only at Luo Fang.

Li Xian had no interest in watching the uncle and nephew fight. Having vented his anger, he found a secluded spot to practice his martial arts in peace.

Although the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword had flaws, it was undoubtedly the highest-level martial art Li Xian had come into contact with.

This sword technique was stripped from the Combined Sword Move, so it seemed to be missing half, with some moves having breakpoints.

"This sword technique aims for the words 'fierce and fierce'."

"The name has 'Setting Sun,' but it does not refer to the setting sun fading at dusk. It is more like the scorching sun hanging high at noon, baking the earth."

"It is just that the scorching sun is broken and incomplete, hence it is called Setting Sun."

Li Xian used his own understanding to comprehend the essence of the sword. One sword after another, seeking slowness and stability.

[You comprehend sword intent, practice sword techniques, Proficiency +2]

[You dance the sword under the sun, honing sword moves, Proficiency +2]

Li Xian reversed the sword edge, executing the move "Hanging Sun Standing." The sword pointed straight up, thrusting directly at the sun in the sky.

Suddenly, he felt a flash of red light at the sword tip, followed by a stream of heat passing down from the tip, along the blade, and invading Li Xian's body.

Sweat poured out instantly.

There was a burning sensation in his heart, and his meridians seemed to be scorched.

[Hanging Sun Standing, sword draws in烈华 (scorching brilliance), but without the Yin sword to complement it, it violates the sword move's taboo, Proficiency +12]

Li Xian gulped down several mouthfuls of cold water.

The burning sensation in his body was hard to消退 (subside). Looking around, he saw a green pool of water. Without hesitation, he jumped into the pool.

Relying on the coolness of the water, he stayed there for a full half-quarter of an hour before feeling some relief and climbing ashore.

But his chest still felt somewhat stifled and hot.

"Wow, a superior sword technique, you really can't practice it casually!"

"Just now, that move 'Hanging Sun Standing' drew Yang Hua into the body. If there were a Yin sword to combine with it, and she executed the corresponding move, the Yang Hua could be dissolved, which would actually be greatly beneficial to both bodies."

"But I have no Yin sword to combine with, so naturally, I couldn't dissolve it. I had no choice but to jump into the lake. Even so, I still felt the burning pain in my heart and the scorching pain in my stomach."

Li Xian had suffered a great loss.

He possessed the "Heaven's Way Rewards Diligence" destiny. As long as the method is correct, even if he repeats the simplest moves forever, his sword technique attainment will surely improve.

There was really no need to risk using dangerous moves just to seek speed.

Just now, [Hanging Sun Standing], although it instantly increased Proficiency by [12] points, it also made him soak in the lake for a long time.

"The wound has split open again."

The skin on Li Xian's back had just started to form a crust.

He held the long sword and made a flourish.

After this incident, he clearly realized that he had underestimated "martial arts."

The martial arts Li Xian had practiced before were mostly basic martial arts.这类 martial arts focused on moves and Qi circulation methods. Practicing them could increase Inner Qi and enhance strength.

But practicing several of them难免 (inevitably) became monotonous.

Today,接触 (contacting) [Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword], he finally knew that the way of martial arts was far more than just that.

While practicing superior martial arts, the body is also influenced by the martial arts, becoming stronger.

Just like [Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword], practiced under the scorching sun. It draws Yang Hua into the body, which can strengthen Yang Qi.

Once Yang Qi is strong, the physical body becomes strong, Yin Qi becomes difficult to approach, and evil spirits avoid it.

But Li Xian felt it wasn't entirely a good thing.

Yang Qi was too strong, he couldn't control it, and distracting thoughts became intense. Moreover, once it exceeded a certain level, internal fire would be vigorous, evaporating Qi and blood instead.

This sword technique was intentionally截取 (intercepted) by Madam Wen.

She passed on most of it, but deliberately left out the method to resolve the Yang Qi in the body.

In this way, if one苦习 (painstakingly practiced) the sword technique, the Yang Qi would be too thick and would evaporate Qi and blood. But if one abandoned the sword technique, due to the sword technique's nature, Qi and blood would also衰减 (decline).

Advancing is like this, retreating is also like this.

Being tightly controlled by the Madam...

"But... if I rely on Heaven's Way Rewards Diligence to cultivate the first layer to its peak, then回头 (look back) to fill in the gaps and补足 (make up for) the missing parts, perhaps I could摆脱 (break free from) the invisible restraint."

"The Madam passing on the method... her things are really hard to take."

Li Xian sighed softly.

After boiling for one night and two days, because it was summer, the pot of refined soup was cooked faster.

This evening, the refined food was about to come out of the cauldron.

Li Xian's spirits were high, his destiny manifested...
