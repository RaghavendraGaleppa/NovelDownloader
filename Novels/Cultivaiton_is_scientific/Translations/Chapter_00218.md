# Chapter 218: Slaying Demons

In an instant, the four mid-stage Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators each unleashed their techniques, fully displaying the eerie and formidable nature of demonic cultivation.

Demonic cultivators could rival orthodox sects in Northern Shu precisely because of their inherent advantages.

Take corpse refinement, for example—it essentially provided an extra helper with strength comparable to their own. Spirit insects, meanwhile, carried deadly toxins that posed serious trouble upon contact.

The demonic cultivators' soul-merging technique could, to some extent, rival powerful body refinement, offering even stronger defensive capabilities—though it was time-limited, functioning as a burst-type technique.

As for the invisible demonic cultivator, they specialized in assassination techniques, making them even more insidious and lethal.

Li Yuanba had long been prepared. Although his interactions with demonic cultivators at the Ten Thousand Swords Peak had been limited, he still had some experience.

Sword cultivators were renowned as the foremost in offensive power, rarely relying on external defensive means, yet they possessed their own methods of countering enemies. Otherwise, sword cultivators would have long been wiped out.

Sword cultivators had extremely strong physical defenses, only slightly weaker than those who specialized in body refinement. Additionally, their speed was astonishing—even without using sword teleportation, their movement in close combat far surpassed that of other cultivators. These were all methods to counter enemy attacks.

Li Yuanba had even cultivated the "Sword Demon Secret Codex," granting him physical defense and speed that exceeded that of ordinary sword cultivators.

His figure flickered as he dodged the swarm of spirit insects, his sword light flashing toward the Foundation Establishment early-stage ghost.

The ghost let out a soul-piercing shriek. Normally, physical sword light would struggle to deal significant damage to a Foundation Establishment ghost.

The best way to deal with such a ghost was through spells, particularly high-powered fire-attribute spells, which inflicted the greatest harm.

However, a sword cultivator's sword light carried sword intent—the very foundation of a sword cultivator's ability to break all techniques.

The Foundation Establishment ghost was struck by the sword light, the massive gash leaving an unhealable wound on its intangible body.

Moreover, the residual sword intent continued to erode the wound, slowly expanding it.

"He's Sword Elder's disciple!" Wang Chengjun cried out in utter terror.

They hadn't been certain before, but now that they had actually fought, the four mid-stage Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators recognized the most unique figure in their sect—Sword Elder.

Sword Elder was the strongest Golden Core cultivator in the sect and had never taken a disciple. While there were sword cultivators in the sect, Sword Elder was the only pure sword cultivator.

A pure sword cultivator who was also a true disciple—there was no need to guess who Li Yuanba's master was.

Sword Elder's reputation in the sect had been carved through bloodshed. A sword cultivator who looked down on demonic techniques yet survived within a demonic sect undoubtedly possessed the means to suppress his peers.

---

Even after learning Li Yuanba's master, Wang Chengjun found himself in a dilemma—they either had to kill Li Yuanba or face execution by the sect or Sword Elder.

His shout backfired, causing the other demonic cultivators to hesitate momentarily.

The only one unaffected was the demonic cultivator whose body had swollen into a three-meter-tall beast. The soul-merging technique affected the user's mind, driving them to fight to the death while minimizing external interference.

Thus, while the other three demonic cultivators were distracted by Li Yuanba's background, the beastly demonic cultivator closed in on him.

A massive spiritual axe descended with full force, the air cracking under its pressure. The terrifying aura, infused with the chilling spiritual energy unique to demonic cultivators and ghosts, sent a bone-deep cold through Li Yuanba.

Li Yuanba sneered. He drew a third-grade sword foundation, utterly unafraid of close combat.

With a sidestep, he dodged the axe's strike, dispelling the chilling energy with his own spiritual power, which did not affect his speed.

His third-grade sword foundation swept upward in a reverse slash. Against the sword intent-infused blade, the iron corpse's defenses were as thin as paper.

From the lower side of the waist to the opposite ribcage, the three-meter-tall demonic cultivator was cleaved in two.

The slash also dispelled the soul-merging technique. The ghost was the first to perish under the sword intent, while the demonic cultivator, though bisected, still struggled desperately.

Li Yuanba paid him no further attention. He knew the extent of his attack—not only had he severed the body, but he had also destroyed the demonic cultivator's spiritual lake, leaving him unable to muster even a trace of spiritual energy.

The spirit insects, initially chasing Li Yuanba, were now drawn to the bisected demonic cultivator's blood, swarming the wounds and gnawing voraciously.

The not-yet-dead demonic cultivator's screams grew even more agonized.

The remaining three demonic cultivators snapped back to their senses. The invisible one halted his approach and retreated.

"I'll use the iron corpse to restrain him!" The ghost-controlling demonic cultivator's eyes flashed with resolve as he transmitted his plan via secret message.

The iron corpse was fast, but still slower than Li Yuanba. Under normal circumstances, catching him would be nearly impossible.

But the Foundation Establishment corpse-refinement techniques included special methods.

The iron corpse's legs exploded, propelling it forward at triple its original speed.

This was a desperate, one-time technique that severely damaged the iron corpse. Even if it survived the battle, repairs would be extremely difficult.

Raising a corpse to Foundation Establishment-level iron corpse status was no easy feat—it required vast resources and time, all of which would be lost after using this technique.

Only a life-or-death situation could justify such a sacrifice.

Not all demonic cultivators were as fortunate as Li Shiming, who had the Netherworld Ghost Formation to aid his corpse refinement, saving him time and resources.

The iron corpse's sudden speed boost caught Li Yuanba off guard. He hadn't expected a Foundation Establishment iron corpse to possess such an ability.

Transformed into a streak of bloody light, the iron corpse closed in and wrapped its arms around Li Yuanba.

A sword cultivator's body wasn't so easily approached. Sword intent erupted from Li Yuanba's body, slicing into the iron corpse.

Yet the iron corpse succeeded in restraining him momentarily, buying time for the other demonic cultivators.

The invisible one was the first to take advantage. The moment the iron corpse self-destructed, he rushed toward Li Yuanba.

As the half-destroyed iron corpse embraced Li Yuanba, the invisible cultivator materialized behind him, thrusting a black dagger silently toward his back.

No matter how powerful an invisibility technique was, attacking would always reveal the user—activating spiritual energy disrupted the technique.

Wang Chengjun was slightly slower. He forcibly recalled the blood-drinking spirit insects and sent them flying toward Li Yuanba while simultaneously hurling a flying sword at him.

For a moment, it seemed Li Yuanba was in grave danger—yet he remained utterly calm.

"Clang!"

A metallic clang echoed across the battlefield. The invisible demonic cultivator was stunned—his spiritual dagger had struck Li Yuanba's body as if it were solid metal.

No, even metal should have yielded easily to a spiritual dagger.

Granted, the stealth attack prevented him from mustering his full power, but the strike was still equivalent to a normal mid-stage Foundation Establishment attack.

Precisely because Li Yuanba was a pure sword cultivator—one who didn't rely on defensive artifacts—the invisible cultivator had chosen this approach.

But who could have guessed that Li Yuanba's greatest defense was his own physique? After consuming the Monkey Wine, his "Sword Demon Secret Codex" had reached great completion, granting him defensive power on par with a late-stage Foundation Establishment body-refinement cultivator.

A normal mid-stage Foundation Establishment attack couldn't breach his defenses.

Moreover, the demonic cultivator's dagger was only upper-grade, not quite top-grade, while Li Yuanba's body was as tough as a spiritual artifact.

Li Yuanba was furious. His lack of combat experience had nearly cost him dearly.

His third-grade sword foundation first slashed through the iron corpse, then, in a fluid motion, beheaded the invisible cultivator behind him.

By then, Wang Chengjun's flying sword had arrived, and the spirit insects were upon him.

"Slash!" Enraged, Li Yuanba roared. Sword light wove into a dense net before him, interlaced with fine threads of sword intent, forming an almost impenetrable barrier.

Wang Chengjun's flying sword, an ordinary spiritual artifact devoid of sword intent, shattered upon contact, its spiritual imprint eroding instantly.

The threads of sword intent then ensnared the sword, completely erasing its imprint and sending it clattering to the ground.

As for the spirit insects, the relentless sword light and threads sliced them into pieces.

Wang Chengjun and the remaining demonic cultivator spat blood—one from the destruction of his iron corpse, the other from the loss of his spirit insects and artifact. Their spirits had suffered backlash.

They turned to flee, no longer concerned with anything but survival.

Regret gnawed at them. How had they provoked such a sword cultivator? Today, they witnessed firsthand the terror of a pure sword cultivator—one whose blade could break all techniques.

Li Yuanba had no intention of letting them escape. As they turned, his sword light overtook them with blinding speed.

Wang Chengjun and the other cultivator had no choice but to activate their defensive artifacts, slowing their retreat and sealing their fate.

Sword light danced around the two, threads of sword intent lashing their defenses like whips.

Two breaths later, they spat blood again, their spirits battered by successive artifact losses.

But they no longer needed to worry about spiritual damage—the sword light separated their wounded minds from their bodies, solving the problem permanently.

The battle, though brief, had been fraught with peril.

The demonic cultivators' unpredictable methods and their superior cultivation bases had made it a challenging fight.

Li Yuanba shook his head. The battle had been meaningless—killing four mid-stage Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators earned him no contribution points.

He collected their storage bags, stashed the corpses in one, cleaned the battlefield, and left without hesitation.

The spiritual fluctuations from the fight would soon draw attention.

In such environments, battles had to end quickly—lest opportunistic onlookers swoop in.

Once sufficiently distant, he slowed and inspected his spoils.

The mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators' storage bags contained ample spirit stones and materials, each worth hundreds of thousands of spirit stones.

Most notably, the invisible cultivator's bag held a golden jade slip—a vessel for top-tier techniques, undoubtedly not from the Nether Sect. Sect techniques were learned within and never taken outside.

Likely, this was the cultivator's personal fortune.

"Phantom Veil Concealment Art"—a top-tier invisibility technique.

Li Yuanba hadn't known that the invisible cultivator was somewhat famous among inner disciples, feared for his stealth.

Invisibility spells existed for Qi Condensation cultivators, but they only worked on mortals or novices. Any cultivator who could sense spiritual energy could easily detect them, making stealth attacks suicidal.

At the Foundation Establishment stage, with spiritual sense, invisibility became even harder to maintain—a single sweep would reveal the hidden cultivator.

Yet during the battle, Li Yuanba's formidable spiritual sense—far surpassing his peers—had detected nothing.

Had the invisible cultivator not attacked, he might have been the sole survivor.

"Killing and looting truly brings riches. Even ordinary cultivators have good stuff!" Li Yuanba murmured with a satisfied smile.

He had slain many Foundation Establishment cultivators—including through his main body, Li Shiming—but ordinary ones rarely carried valuables.

Demonic cultivators were different. Trusting no one, they carried their entire wealth even into battle, making Li Yuanba's haul exceptionally rich.
