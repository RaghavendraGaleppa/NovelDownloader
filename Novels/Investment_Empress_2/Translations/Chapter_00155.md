# Chapter 155: You Actually Opened? The Beast Peak Uprising

Li Mo was astonished, and couldn't help but sigh.

Even that ice lump couldn't escape it.

See, how powerful the "it's so fragrant" law is.

"Another daily investment return added to the list."

He felt that in the future, when introducing himself, he could no longer say he had a small fortune; his conscience would hurt.

As the saying goes: Wealthy and powerful.

From now on, he was Li, wealthy and powerful, Mo.

With a thought, a pair of white shoes adorned with auspicious cloud patterns and seven strange stones appeared on his feet.

Seven Star Cloud Treading Boots.

Li Mo felt as if he were stepping on clouds. With a single step forward, he shot forward.

The feeling of being pushed was incredibly strong.

He tried to control the slight True Origin just born in his Dantian with his Will Soul.

*Whoosh—*

This was the feeling of flying~

Only the Inner Scene realm could fly, but借助 these boots, he had prematurely experienced traveling through the air.

Of course, there were still differences.

Unlike flying in the Inner Scene realm, he was more like running across the sky on clouds.

.....

Outer Affairs Hall.

At this moment, the vast Outer Affairs Hall was packed. Looking around, one saw only true disciples and senior Inner Hall stewards.

Any one of them, placed in the Ziyang Prefecture's martial world, was qualified to establish a sect. The strongest person in some counties was only at the Observation of the Divine realm.

Everyone wore a solemn expression.

Qian Bufan stood at the front, hands behind his back, and said:

"Although Yin Huaxuan was seriously injured and used a secret technique to escape, his strength has dropped by eighty percent."

"However, the foundation of of Inner still."

,, he said, "If you discover its trail, immediately fire a signal arrow to alert us."

"Yes!"

Everyone nodded.

The atmosphere was incredibly tense.

*Boom—*

A loud noise came from the sky!

A figure fell from the heavens, smashing through the floor and kicking up a large cloud of dust. Within the dust...

there was a figure!

Everyone looked as if they were facing a great enemy, especially the disciples of the Outer Affairs Hall, because usually, the only person who would make such an entrance was... Shang Wu!

After all, within the sect, the number of Inner Scene realm experts could be counted on one's fingers.

The dust settled.

Countless gazes looked over and saw a person standing tall and proud within the dust, hands behind his back. They couldn't help but be stunned.

"Junior Brother Li?"

Ouyang recognized the newcomer in a daze:

"You flew here?"

"That's right."

Li Mo clicked his tongue and raised his chin.

"How can you fly?"

"Pretty cool, right?"

Actually, just as he flew to the entrance, he couldn't maintain his levitation state anymore.

So he just crashed straight down.

"Cool, yes, it's cool..."

Ouyang's face was filled with a strange expression. Li Mo, confused, followed his line of sight and looked back, only to be startled.

Elder Qian wore a deadpan expression, his small green eyes filled with displeasure.

In the end, Little Li paid three hundred taels to repair the tiles of the Outer Affairs Hall.

Putting away the silver bills, Qian Bufan said impatiently:

"Li Mo, what are you doing here? The Sect Master said it's for Observation of the Divine realm disciples."

Admittedly, he knew Li Mo's combat power was extremely strong.

But the main task this time wasn't combat, but a carpet search.

If one hasn't reached the Observation of the Divine realm, their Will Soul perception is insufficient. Even if they can fight, it's useless.

"Does opening the orifices count as the Observation of the Divine realm?"

"Naturally, it counts... Huh?"

What did that mean?

Qian Bufan's expression shifted. He slightly probed with his senses, and his face immediately became incredibly strange.

Li Mo had actually opened his orifices.

No way.

Ying Bing was at the main peak's ancestral hall, using the incomplete bronze divine tree as her Observation of the Divine diagram, and she hasn't opened her orifices yet.

You,小子, opened yours?

"Good luck, I stumbled upon a natural wonder."

"I slept, and when I woke up, I opened my orifices."

Li Mo spread his hands.

Qian Bufan: "......"

Who taught you to break through like this?

Oh, his master is Shang Wu... This is still unreasonable!

"A sixteen-year-old at the Observation of the Divine realm?"

Everyone fell silent.

In the entire Ziyang Prefecture, there probably isn't a young genius with such a speed of progress.

---

There isn't one in the Eastern Wilderness Region either.

This is almost enough to rival the strongest prodigies in a state, possessing the qualification to compete for the潜龍榜 (Hidden Dragon Ranking).

Of course, apart from the stewards, the Observation of the Divine realm disciples, including Ouyang, weren't surprised.

Having entered the秘境 (secret realm) with Junior Brother Li, one wouldn't be surprised by him opening his orifices so early.

Even Bai Jinghong has to call Li Mo 'Brother'!

"Ahem, since that's the case..."

Qian Bufan cleared his throat and said, "Li Mo, you will join the operation. Be careful."

After speaking, he looked at the crowd:

"Which team is short on people?"

*Swish—*

Ouyang raised his hand without hesitation, his gaze as firm as if joining the Party.

Li Mo nodded.

It was best to be with familiar people.

"Senior Brothers and Sisters."

Li Mo stepped forward and saluted.

After a simple greeting, he didn't say much more, squinting his eyes and observing the people present.

He would use the Destiny Divine Eye to scan them first.

There might be a surprise?

【Name: Xu Zhiqing】
【Age: 27】
【Bone Constitution: Heavenly Water Sword Body.】
【Realm: Four Orifices of Observation of the Divine.】
【Destiny: Blue-Grey】
【Evaluation: The true disciple senior sister of Luoxia Peak. She has been in seclusion for five years, practicing the Wave-Cutting Sword Draw Technique hard, hoping to make a splash at the Yunzhou Martial Arts Summit and obtain the chance to observe the sword mark of Hengyun Sword City.】
【Recent Event: During the hunt for Yin Huaxuan, her right hand was injured, causing her to miss the Martial Arts Summit.】

...

【Name: Miao Jinyin.】
【Age: 26】
【Realm: Two Orifices of Observation of the Divine.】
...

These two were the senior brother and sister he would be operating with.

In other words.

They would likely encounter Yin Huaxuan later?

Li Mo looked not far away.

Miao Jinyin was a senior brother with a square face.

And that senior sister named Xu Zhiqing, dressed in tight-fitting clothes, was talking to Ouyang.

"Didn't we already have enough people?" Xu Zhiqing, the true disciple from Luoxia Peak, frowned.

No matter how much of a prodigy he is, he just entered the Observation of the Divine realm. Bringing him along would be a hindrance. If they encountered a powerful enemy, they would have to split their attention to protect him.

"Senior Sister Xu, you just came out of seclusion, so you don't know."

Ouyang lowered his voice:

"Junior Brother Li is pleasant to talk to, his strength is strong, and he's approachable..."

Xu Zhiqing: "....."

It's mainly the "approachable" part, isn't it?

Qian Bufan took two steps forward and said loudly:

"Alright, everyone, go to your assigned jurisdictions."

......

Not long after.

In the forest near the Beast Peak, several figures flitted past.

With the elder and senior brother gone, the disciples of this peak seemed lost.

But after Qian Bufan found someone to manage it, normal operations were maintained, and no major chaos occurred.

The various beasts being raised or caged were all incredibly quiet.

"Would that Yin Huaxuan... the traitor, really return to the Beast Peak?"

Miao Jinyin had a straw root in his mouth.

"We should still search with all our might and resolve this matter as soon as possible," Xu Zhiqing said. She just wanted to return to practicing her sword.

"Junior Brother Li, how have your painting skills been lately?"

"Do you need my one-on-one service?"

"By the way, my 'Love Moon Treasure Mirror' can have a private custom edition. If you need it..."

Ouyang was promoting.

"...... Senior Brother, I'm not interested in your painting albums, and moreover... we're on a mission."

Li Mo couldn't help but hold his forehead and said seriously:

"The darkest place is under the candlestick. Maybe Yin Huaxuan really would return to the Beast Peak."

"Let's focus on completing our duties first."

Hearing this, Xu Zhiqing looked at this Junior Brother Li with a bit more respect, finding him quite reliable.

Late at night.

The few of them still maintained a certain distance, searching separately in the forest.

Half an hour later.

*Roar—*

Suddenly, from atop the Beast Peak, a chorus of beast roars erupted!

The very ground seemed to tremble.

"Run!"

"The beasts are in an uproar!"

A true disciple of the Beast Peak came running towards them.
