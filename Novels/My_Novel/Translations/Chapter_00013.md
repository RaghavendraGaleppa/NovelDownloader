# Chapter 13: A Breakthrough in Fist Technique and All-Round Perception

Luo Tongyun frowned. He knew exactly who Luo Fang was.

Luo Fang was the steward of the servant quarters. He held some authority, but it didn't extend to Luo Tongyun. Strictly speaking, the two of them had worked together before.

"Steward Luo, is there something that can't be said outside?" Luo Tongyun asked with a smile.

"Please, come in."

Luo Fang pushed open the door and stepped aside to invite him in, offering no further explanation.

"Alright."

Luo Tongyun nodded with a smile. If someone had a favor to ask, there would surely be a reward. How could he refuse?

After entering the room and sitting down, Luo Fang poured a cup of tea and said, "We know each other well enough, so I won't beat around the bush."

"Five taels of silver to get Li Xian back to the servant quarters."

Luo Tongyun said casually, "That Li Xian... is being watched by Commander Pang. He won't be easy to deal with."

"Heh heh," Luo Fang laughed. "But it's easy for you. Commander Pang asked you to teach him the Square Fist, didn't he? Just sabotage him a little, make sure he performs terribly in fifteen days. Then it'll be done naturally."

"..."

Luo Tongyun just drank his tea, remaining silent.

"Ten taels of silver," Luo Fang said, his expression turning ugly.

Just to vent his anger, ten taels of silver seemed hardly worth it. Luo Fang was afraid that if Li Xian rose to prominence in the future, he might threaten his own position.

"Deal."

Luo Tongyun said with a beaming smile.

In just a few words, he had sold Li Xian out.

[Square Fist]

[Proficiency: 54/500 Novice]

A day of intense training, and the progress wasn't slow. Li Xian felt his muscles becoming more defined.

"It's a pity the Ox Demon Fist is only a fragment. Otherwise, its power would surely be immense."

"Right... Commander Pang said earlier that martial artists primarily train in forms and strength."

"Forms refer to the routines of various martial arts, the angles of attacks, techniques, and so on."

"Strength... likely refers to internal and external strength. External strength can be crudely understood as brute force."

"Internal strength is..."

Sensing a warm current flowing through his lower abdomen.

Through the Ox Demon Fist, Li Xian had already cultivated a bit of "internal strength." He had a vague understanding of the connection between martial arts and strength.

Only when one's martial arts reach a certain level of proficiency can one cultivate a trace of strength.

Through day after day of diligent practice, one can become a master of internal strength.

"Commander Pang, for example, splitting bamboo with an empty palm... how much internal strength would that require? And what level of proficiency has his Empty Palm reached?"

"The path of martial arts is difficult to seek, and there's no clear path to follow. But now, I've at least touched the edges of it."

After finishing his evening meal, Li Xian went to the open ground in the residence's courtyard and began practicing the Square Fist again.

"Fourth Brother, training so hard is ineffective."

Zhao Han, returning from his patrol, saw that Li Xian was still engrossed in his fist practice and couldn't help but advise him.

"Martial arts cannot be achieved overnight. If you train for too long, your body will grow fatigued and resistant. If you continue, your martial arts might not improve; it could even regress."

"This is why some people, despite being very diligent, only have average martial arts proficiency."

Zhao Han truly saw Li Xian as one of his own. This was all based on experience.

But for Li Xian, it was completely useless.

[Proficiency +1]

His arms ached unbearably, but Li Xian persisted, smiling. "First Brother, I have nothing better to do anyway. I'll just practice a bit more, it's no trouble."

Zhao Han waved his hand. "I have to say, you小子 are a real beast."

"Then again, if you weren't a beast, how would you have risen from a servant to this position?"

"But in my opinion, martial arts are good enough as long as they're usable. We're just servants working as guards, we don't need to roam the Jianghu."

***

The next day arrived in the blink of an eye.

After the morning training, Li Xian, brimming with questions, immediately sought out Luo Tongyun for answers.

Luo Tongyun's smile was the same as yesterday's. "Brother Li, you've done an excellent job. These questions are all very reasonable."

He then answered them one by one.

"Brother Li, why don't you perform the fist form in front of me? I'll teach you how to improve your technique."

Luo Tongyun made the request.

Li Xian nodded, assumed the stance, and performed a full set with genuine effort. He thought to himself that despite his diligent practice, while his progress wasn't particularly fast, it was at least decent and by the book.

To his surprise, Luo Tongyun shook his head repeatedly. "Slow! Far too slow. Brother Li, your talent for martial arts is truly mediocre."

"Is that so?" Li Xian was puzzled. Yesterday, it seemed he had said something different.

Just then, another guard approached. "I told you so. The only reason he became a guard is because he got lucky."

This guard was named Qiao Dashou. He had met Li Xian once before. When Li Xian was signing up, Qiao had stopped him, spouting a lot of nonsense to belittle Li Xian and show off his own superiority.

After being beaten and left with a stinging face and nowhere to hide, he had started paying attention to Li Xian, developing a strong dislike for him.

Li Xian paid him no mind, waiting only for Luo Tongyun's explanation.

"If you continue at this pace, in fifteen days... I'm afraid you won't pass Commander Pang's test," Luo Tongyun said with feigned concern.

Doubt arose in Li Xian's heart.

*Is this true or false? I didn't slack off yesterday, and my proficiency is steadily increasing. Is it really as terrible as he says?*

Luo Tongyun sighed and shook his head. "Very well, very well. I'll teach you a few tricks. Practice according to these tricks from now on."

"I guarantee you'll satisfy Commander Pang."

With that, he performed a set of training routines for the fist right in front of Li Xian.

Li Xian practiced it once as instructed.

[Proficiency +0]

The rare occurrence of proficiency not increasing.

"This method of practicing the fist is wrong. Luo Tongyun has malicious intentions toward me," Li Xian analyzed the situation, and everything became clear.

Luo Tongyun wore a gentle smile, his face full of concern.

"Brother Li, have you understood it? Practice this way from now on. If you have any questions, just come ask me again."

"Alright, you can go about your business now."

Li Xian decided not to alert the enemy and pretended to go along with it.

Once Luo Tongyun was far away, he immediately switched back to his original fist technique. He threw punch after punch, increasing his proficiency and tempering his physique.

[Square Fist]

[Proficiency: 187/500 Novice]

Four days passed in the blink of an eye.

Morning runs to exercise the body, martial arts to strengthen the physique.

Since becoming a guard, Li Xian had been eating well and dressing warmly, with adequate nutrition.

He happened to be at the age for a growth spurt, and his height began to increase.

This morning's training.

Everyone else had already sat down to rest, but Li Xian alone was repeatedly practicing his fist techniques against a wooden post.

"Fourth Brother, that beast, is still practicing his fist."

"I'm telling you, just going through the motions is enough. Even if we practice to our deaths, we're just guards. Why go to such lengths?"

"Fourth Brother is a real hard case. In my opinion, that ferocity is only comparable to Huo Hanying from Room One."

"Huo Hanying? I heard that a few days ago, he slapped a thief who was secretly chopping wood to death. I don't know if it's true or not."

"It's true. One slap shattered the man's lungs. I heard he's won the Madam's favor and was rewarded with a palm technique. He's the most likely to inherit Commander Pang's position in the future."

Zhao Han and the others chatted idly, discussing the topic with great interest.

Seeing Li Xian practicing his martial arts seriously, they didn't disturb him and quietly left.

Li Xian paid them no mind. Suddenly, he threw a punch. At the moment of impact, the intent contained within his fist underwent a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering change.

A tremor ran through his body, and a screen of light flashed before his eyes:

[Square Fist]

[Proficiency: 1/1000 Proficient]

[Description: A blend of hardness and softness. Hard, it can shake the eight directions; soft, it can shift the universe. Through your diligent practice, while achieving a level of proficiency, you have grasped its essential meaning and领悟ed the "All-Round Perception" trait.]

"Just by focusing your attention, your hearing will be greatly enhanced. You can also roughly discern your opponent's attack patterns based on the flow of air."

Li Xian was both shocked and delighted.

Heaven rewards the diligent. As long as the effort is deep enough, the rewards will come naturally!

"Brother Li, long time no see. How is your fist practice coming along?"

At that moment, Luo Tongyun walked toward him, still wearing that gentle smile.
