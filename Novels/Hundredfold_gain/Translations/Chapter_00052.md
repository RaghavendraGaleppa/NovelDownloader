# Chapter 52: Shattering Magical Artifacts with Bare Fists, Terror

"What?!"

The burly middle-aged rogue cultivator's eyes widened in panic as he saw Qi Chuan transform into a streak of jade light, charging toward him at astonishing speed. 

He had prepared for Qi Chuan's resistance, but never expected such a direct assault.

"Fine! If you dare charge at me like this, then die!"

With a cold snort, the burly rogue cultivator raised both hands, igniting two stacks of talismans. Instantly, they transformed into a barrage of crimson fireballs and slender blue water arrows, all hurtling toward the jade streak that was Qi Chuan.

Yet, the fireballs were no larger than peanuts, and the water arrows were unusually thin. 

Qi Chuan didn't evade in the slightest. He plunged straight into the onslaught of fire and water.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Explosions echoed as the blue water arrows shattered upon impact with Qi Chuan's jade-like skin, dissipating into vapor. The tiny fireballs merely fizzled out against his skin, leaving not even a faint mark. 

His jade skin, honed to perfection through the first layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body technique, rivaled the durability of top-tier low-grade magical artifacts. These shoddy talismans couldn't hope to harm him.

Not only was Qi Chuan unharmed, his speed increased as he tore through the barrage, closing the distance in an instant.

"How is this possible?!" 

The burly rogue cultivator's face twisted in shock and terror. Though his talismans were crude, they were still low-grade artifacts—and in such numbers! How could anyone simply ignore them and charge straight through?

This wasn't how cultivators fought! Qi Chuan wasn't even using spells—it was as if he hadn't tapped into his spiritual energy at all. 

It was monstrous.

Driven by fear, the rogue cultivator slapped his chest, summoning a black, brick-like slab from beneath his robes—a deformed low-grade defensive artifact, originally meant to resemble a turtle shell but warped beyond recognition due to shoddy craftsmanship.

Even so, it was functional. Infused with spiritual energy, it expanded into a misshapen barrier half a man's height, covered in faint turtle-shell patterns.

Crash!

Just as the barrier formed, Qi Chuan's fist—radiating blinding jade light—slammed into it with devastating force.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Fissures spiderwebbed across the slab before it exploded into fragments, scattering in all directions. 

Shards grazed the rogue cultivator's face, drawing thin lines of blood. His eyes widened in abject horror as he stared at the jade-skinned figure before him, his heart trembling.

This deformed slab was still a defensive artifact! How could it be shattered by a mere fist?!

"Could this man be a demon in human form?" 

Never having encountered a body cultivator before, the rogue cultivator could only assume the worst. His terror deepened as he beheld Qi Chuan—a monster in human skin.

Thud!

His thoughts were cut short as his head burst apart in a shower of crimson and white. Qi Chuan waved a hand, repelling the gore with a pulse of spiritual energy, leaving himself spotless.

"You should've stuck to selling talismans," Qi Chuan murmured, shaking his head at the corpse. "I didn't want to kill you."

He examined his right fist, now stained with blood. With a flick, water condensed around it, washing away the stains, before flames evaporated the droplets, leaving it clean.

A quick search of the body yielded a single low-grade spirit stone and about twenty fragmented spirit beads—equivalent to just over three spirit stones in total.

"Pathetic. No wonder he turned to robbery," Qi Chuan scoffed. 

The man was clearly an amateur—both in judgment and wealth. Ignoring the crude talismans still hidden in the corpse's robes, Qi Chuan turned to leave.

But before he did, his gaze flicked toward a distant corner, his brow furrowing. 

He could faintly sense another presence—another rogue cultivator, likely more skilled in stealth and possibly stronger in cultivation. 

Yet, for some reason, they hadn't shown themselves. 

Perhaps witnessing their companion's gruesome end had deterred them.

"Smart move. If you'd come out, I'd have shown you the power of a treasure talisman," Qi Chuan mused. "I really need to train my Clear-Sight technique. Can't keep being blind to stealth."

With that, he leaped away, his jade-lit figure vanishing into the distance.

"Whew... that was close..."

From the shadowed corner, a hunched old man emerged—none other than the same one who had purchased Qi Chuan's damaged high-grade artifact at the Breeze Pavilion.

"A body cultivator... He must be from the Moonwind Sect, or at least from a major cultivation clan. Thank heavens I didn't act."

The old man shuddered. 

Body cultivation demanded vast resources—only major factions could nurture such talents. If Qi Chuan were a Moonwind disciple, killing him would invite catastrophic retaliation. 

Even if he succeeded, the Moonwind Sect's reach was absolute within dozens of miles. There'd be no escape.

And Qi Chuan had also exuded traces of spiritual energy—a dual cultivator of body and magic. Such individuals were even more terrifying. 

Who knew what other tricks he had up his sleeve?

"Lucky for me, that fool took the fall first," the old man muttered, casting a grateful glance at the corpse before slipping away.
