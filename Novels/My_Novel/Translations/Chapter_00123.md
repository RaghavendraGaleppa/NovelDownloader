Chapter 123: Madam’s Machinations, Enemies Everywhere

The entrance to the Qian Lou (Money Tower) was flanked by towering wooden pillars, upon which were inscribed various slogans.

Li Xian thought to himself, "Though blunt, they seem to speak the truth."

"Force can coerce one person, a hundred, or even ten thousand. It can make ghosts push the millstone and bend men's backs."

"But only money can truly make people willing."

This was the case with the Yihe Manor.

Madam Wen’s martial arts were unfathomable, yet what sustained the manor was wealth. Guards, servants, attendants, workers, and mulberry girls—all received salaries.

Inside the tower, it was bustling with activity. The decor was magnificent, with carved beams and painted rafters. Not long after the two entered, Madam Wen, quite familiar with the place, walked up to a bronze bell and gave it a light tap.

A crisp chime rang out, and a steward approached.

"May I ask if you two heroes are here to collect a token?" the steward asked with a smile as warm as the spring breeze.

He had already discerned that the two followed the lead of the lady in white. Seeing Li Xian’s extraordinary and heroic bearing, he prudently addressed them as "two heroes" to avoid offending anyone.

Madam Wen said, "Get me a Green Token," and handed over a jade pendant as proof of identity.

The steward compared the token and his expression changed to one of shock. Realizing the woman was no ordinary person, his speech became even more respectful: "Madam, please demonstrate your identity."

Madam Wen took back the jade pendant and gave her wrist a slight shake. Unbeknownst to all, she employed some technique, and the jade pendant emitted a faint golden halo. It was quite extraordinary.

"Good, good. Please wait a moment, I shall fetch the token for you immediately," the steward said, hurrying away upon seeing the sight.

Madam Wen remained calm and composed, as if everything was under her control. Li Xian, however, was quite puzzled and asked, "Madam, what is this place?"

Madam Wen put the proof of identity back into her sleeve and said indifferently, "You have just entered the Jianghu, so naturally you are unaware."

"The Qian Lou is a bank belonging to the Qian Meng, the Money Alliance, within the Great Wu Dynasty."

"You can withdraw money with paper deeds. But for us martial artists, dealing with thousands or hundreds of silver taels is quite inconvenient."

"That is why in some prominent locations, Qian Lou branches are established. If martial artists wish to purchase something, they do not need to carry money with them; they only need to come here."

"Using a token to prove their identity, they have the Qian Lou provide a token, and then use that token to purchase or exchange goods."

Li Xian was greatly enlightened. "So that's how it is."

Before long, the steward returned with the Green Token. Madam Wen remained silent, her hands clasped in her sleeves. Li Xian, knowing his place, stepped forward to take the token.

"Farewell, Madam," the steward said with a smile as he saw them off. The Madam, however, ignored him.

Li Xian observed the Green Token, rubbing it gently with his fingers. He discovered the token was made of some secret iron, neither gold nor silver. A gentle squeeze could change its shape.

"All money tokens are made of secret sand. In every monetary transaction, each grain of secret sand represents one coin."

"A green token represents approximately one thousand silver taels. If you spill a few grains, the amount of money will be deducted from your body."

Madam Wen looked at Li Xian with great interest.

Li Xian’s heart tightened, and he quickly wrapped the Green Token tightly in his clothes. Madam Wen smiled faintly, thinking, "Having this boy by my side is quite amusing."

"Walk faster," Madam Wen said, reaching out to grab Li Xian's right arm and taking a step forward. Li Xian felt his body become light and empty, and in the blink of an eye, the scenery changed as they teleported several zhang away.

Clearly, the Madam’s lightness skill was formidable, almost unbelievable. Enveloped by her internal energy, she rapidly advanced with Li Xian.

The Ten Thousand Medicinal Mountains nurtured countless medicinal herbs.

Vegetation, snakes, insects, rats, rain, dew, mud, and stones... all could serve as medicinal materials.

"Snake and Insect Alley."

The Madam headed straight for the depths, walking to the entrance of the alley before slowing her step.

The alley was filled with Zhou family's medicinal slaves, who lived off the Zhou family. Their stalls displayed various snake and insect medicinal materials.

The Madam walked to a stall, her gaze fixed on a black long worm.

The so-called Qian worm was originally a type of winged centipede. This centipede was non-toxic and harmless, but its mouthparts were sharp enough to bite through gold and stone.

Seeing that Madam Wen had stopped moving, looking cold and elegant, creating a sense of distance from her surroundings, Li Xian couldn't help but think to himself, "She is the renowned '折剑夫人' (Broken Sword Madam), yet she makes me do everything. She's really exploiting me."

He stepped forward and took the initiative to ask, "Brother, how much for this insect?"

"Young hero, this Feiling Black Feather Insect, I'll sell it to you for twenty taels," the medicinal slave said with a grin.

Li Xian cursed, "Your words are untrue, I'm not buying." The medicinal slave waved his hand to shoo him away. "How are they untrue? You don't have to buy it, others will."

Li Xian sneered, "This beast is no Feiling Black Feather Insect. It's clearly a Qian worm. This kind of insect that can fly and burrow is the easiest to misidentify. If you don't know the difference, should I teach you?"

He didn't know the market price of Qian worms; he was just bluffing. But with his imposing manner, the false could be made to sound true.

Moreover, he had hit the mark.

"This... this..."

The medicinal slave was dumbfounded, not daring to argue, afraid of causing a crowd. He quickly pulled Li Xian's hand and pleaded, "Good brother, I was wrong, I was wrong... You... twelve silver taels, take this insect!"

The market price for a Qian worm was fifteen taels.

Li Xian saw that this one was very small, but ten grams would be enough. He handed over the Green Token. The medicinal slave also took out a token. When the two tokens touched, the secret sand flowed into the medicinal slave's token.

The transaction was complete.

"This method of transaction is indeed extremely convenient," Li Xian thought.

A single Qian worm cost over ten taels, but the Madam was here to prepare medicinal materials. It couldn't be just one.

Li Xian walked along the street, engaging in a battle of wits with the stall-keeping medicinal slaves. He bought the Qian worms he saw one by one.

Wealth flowed like sand... hundreds of taels vanished in a moment.

"Martial artists are truly money pits. For the Madam, these hundreds of taels are nothing. But this Qian worm is only the cheapest ingredient for refining pills. One refinement... costs at least a thousand taels!"

Li Xian calculated silently, recalling his early years as a hunter. He and his father went into the mountains to hunt, tracking beasts. After catching a wild boar, the shopkeeper would only pay them a dozen or so coins.

"Madam, is this enough?" Li Xian asked after browsing for half the day, his medicine pouch now holding fifty Qian worms.

"Barely enough," the Madam said with satisfaction.

Returning to the Qian Lou, they returned the Green Token. The reduced amount of secret sand was converted to silver and directly deducted from the account.

The Madam still had some loose silver on her.

They weren't in a hurry to leave and walked along the street to see if there were any other medicinal herbs they fancied.

As time passed, the pedestrians in Zhou City became more numerous, mostly there to buy medicine. Amidst the pushing and shoving, the crowd suddenly surged like a wave. Li Xian stepped forward, shielding the Madam and separating the crowd. "Madam, be careful."

Madam Wen smiled meaningfully. Li Xian's cry of "Madam, be careful" was partly to curry favor. Madam Wen wouldn't have fallen for it in her youth, but now she found it quite pleasing.

After having lunch in Zhou City, they prepared to return.

On the way back...

Suddenly, they heard a commotion not far away:

"This Fragrant Meat Mushroom, I saw it first. How can you just snatch it away? That's so unreasonable."

"Reason? The one who offers a higher price is reasonable. I want this Fragrant Meat Mushroom."

"Alright, Sun Hao the Stone Hand, you're deliberately crossing me. I, Cheng Hu the Swallow Blade, won't stand for this."

"Everyone, come and see! Come and judge this for us!"

In front of a medicinal shop, more and more pedestrians gathered.

Those who entered the medicinal trade usually had some martial arts skills. With such a disturbance, it wouldn't be easy to resolve.

Li Xian had no interest, but the Madam's figure flickered, moving through the crowd as if strolling in a courtyard.

Sun Hao knew he was in the wrong and said angrily, "Cheng Hu! What do you mean by this? Do you think I'll back down just because of this scene?"

Cheng Hu let out a cold "humph" and continued to call for onlookers.

Sun Hao flew into a rage and suddenly made a move, kicking towards Cheng Hu's lower back. Cheng Hu let out an "哎哟" (ouch) and rolled forward, dissipating most of the force.

"Cheng Hu, don't say I'm bullying you. Since we both want this mushroom, let's have a proper martial arts duel!"

"The winner takes it!" Sun Hao said.

Cheng Hu was also furious. "Alright!"

Both were considered good fighters in the Jianghu and quite famous in the area. Hearing that the two were about to duel, the onlookers cheered them on.

The two were now pinned to the stake; they had to fight. Just then, a voice rang out:

"You two don't need to rush into a duel. I have a way to resolve your conflict and restore peace, so you won't have to fall out over this mushroom."

Everyone looked towards the sound.

They saw a youth walking out of the crowd; it was Li Xian. Just a moment ago, the Madam had instructed him to intervene.

"Kid, do you really have a way?"

"If you're making fun of us, I'll beat you to death."

"What's your method? Spit it out quickly."

Sun Hao and Cheng Hu stared with fierce expressions.

Li Xian saw that these two were as strong as tigers. Their aura suggested they had long since entered the Food Essence realm. They were famous martial artists, much stronger than Zheng Xuezhang and his kind.

He said, "My method is... why don't you two gift this Fragrant Meat Mushroom to me?"

Sun Hao and Cheng Hu were taken aback. They exchanged a glance, both revealing a fierce look, and said in unison, "It seems we are truly old. Even a whippersnapper dares to make fun of us."

"Kid, since you don't know the meaning of death, don't blame us for crippling you."

The two stepped forward, one on the left and one on the right, pressing down on Li Xian's shoulders.

However, in the next instant, the two froze on the spot. Several acupoints on their bodies had been sealed, and their bodies went rigid, unable to move at all.

Cold sweat poured down their backs, and they stammered, "Ma... Madam..."

They saw Madam Wen standing behind Li Xian. She had intentionally concealed her presence, and no one had noticed.

When the two approached, she shot out energy from her fingertips, sealing their acupoints from a distance and fixing them in place.

Madam Wen smiled and said, "Li Xian, these two wanted to cripple you. What do you want to do?"

Li Xian said, "Give them a taste of their own medicine?"

Sun Hao and Cheng Hu wanted to kneel and kowtow, but their whole bodies were immobilized, so they could only await their fate.

Madam Wen said, "Not good. With your current cultivation, you probably can't cripple them."

"Let's do this. You cut off one hand from each of them, and we'll call it even."

Li Xian said, "Alright." He drew his saber and slashed down. The slash was swift and decisive, filled with internal energy, revealing a perfected saber technique, quite extraordinary.

The blade sank several inches... but failed to sever the hand in one slash.

Li Xian slashed again, but the same thing happened. First, the physical body of a Food Essence martial artist was extremely tough. Second, the internal energy they had cultivated automatically protected its master.

Instead, Li Xian's hand felt numb and sore.

It wasn't until the fourth slash that he finally severed Sun Hao's left hand.

He then did the same to Cheng Hu's left hand.

Only then could the two move again, and they fell to their knees with a plop.

Madam Wen looked down at them and said indifferently, "How was that? Is his method useful?"

"Madam Wen, spare us! Madam Wen, spare us! We were blind not to recognize Mount Tai," the two pleaded.

"Since that's the case, who does this Fragrant Meat Mushroom belong to?" Madam Wen asked.

"It belongs to you, it belongs to you," they said, wincing in pain, but not daring to show any displeasure, anger, or resentment.

"Wrong," Madam Wen said. "Slap your own faces."

The onlookers who had been fanning the flames fell silent. They all felt the Madam was too ruthless, severing limbs and then humiliating them like this.

Li Xian thought the same, but he could only obey. He slapped each of them twice across the face.

"I'm asking you two again, who does this mushroom belong to?" Madam Wen asked.

"It's..." Sun Hao had a sudden idea. "It's this young master's, this young master's." He pointed at Li Xian.

Madam Wen nodded with satisfaction. "Li Xian, buy the mushroom and come with me."

The carriage left Zhou City.

Li Xian examined the mushroom and asked curiously, "Madam, do you have a grudge against those two?"

Madam Wen lay sideways on the couch, resting with her eyes closed. "If I had a grudge, they wouldn't have just lost an arm."

"This mushroom is a reward for you. Keep it, and don't ask any more questions."

A smile crossed her lips... So far, Li Xian had been very satisfactory to her. If she didn't make him create more enemies, how could he truly become inseparable from her?

"Take this box of fine meat. Swallow it only after we return to the manor. Enter the Food Essence realm as soon as possible. I'm curious to see what phase you will wash out."

"Take one gram of this meat every two days."

"If my calculations are correct, it will be enough for you to wash away your impurities, reveal your '脱胎相' (Rebirth Phase), and enter the Food Essence realm."

Madam Wen's voice was languid as she waved her hand.

An exquisitely crafted box, the size of a palm, extended from behind the carriage curtain.
