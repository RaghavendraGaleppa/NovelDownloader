# Chapter 86: Demonstrating Value

"Let's go!"

Seeing Ye Yuqi had nothing more to say, Yuan Niya waved at Chu Feifei and left the Duty Hall, leaving behind a gloomy-faced Ye Yuqi.

"Senior Sister, are you from the valley—"

Following Yuan Niya out of the Duty Hall, Chu Feifei couldn't help but ask.

"That's right. Junior Brother Gu Mo used up one of my promises to have me rescue you," Yuan Niya nodded, making no attempt to hide the truth.

Hearing this, Chu Feifei's heart tightened. A promise from an inner sect disciple—Gu Mo had actually used it up just like that. This was a debt she could never repay.

"Senior Sister Yuan, where are we going now?" Seeing that Yuan Niya showed no intention of stopping, Chu Feifei asked. If they continued, they would leave the Formation Peak.

"Taking you to Junior Brother Gu Mo. However, he doesn't want anyone to know he's involved, so we'll have to take a long detour." Yuan Niya summoned her flying sword and gestured for Chu Feifei to board.

Gu Mo had asked Yuan Niya to intervene and protect Chu Feifei, which would obviously offend Ye Yuqi, an inner sect disciple. Yuan Niya, with her master being an elder of the Enforcement Hall, naturally had nothing to fear. But Gu Mo was different—he was merely an outer sect disciple and didn't want to expose himself now, drawing the ire of an inner sect disciple.

"They're here!"

Gu Mo, who had been waiting quietly in his spirit field cottage, glanced at the communication jade slip in his hand and smiled. He then activated the spirit field's formation, allowing two figures to slip in unnoticed. The formation reactivated immediately, completely concealing their presence.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, mission accomplished!"

Yuan Niya pointed at Chu Feifei behind her.

"Thank you, Senior Sister Yuan!"

Gu Mo bowed deeply. Without Yuan Niya's intervention, resolving Chu Feifei's predicament would have been extremely difficult.

"Senior Sister, please wait a moment!" Gu Mo called out to Yuan Niya, who was about to leave, then pulled Chu Feifei aside.

"Fairy Chu, what are your plans from now on?" Gu Mo asked. After this incident, Chu Feifei's situation had become complicated. The one targeting her wasn't just Ye Yuqi—there was also the Formation Peak's steward, which was the real headache.

Gu Mo could ask Yuan Niya to protect Chu Feifei once, but he couldn't rely on her every time.

"I... I don't know."

Chu Feifei was at a loss. If she returned now, Steward Lan would undoubtedly not let her off easily. Even if Steward Lan wouldn't openly suppress her due to Yuan Niya's influence, as the Formation Peak's steward, there were countless ways to make life difficult for a mere laborer disciple like Chu Feifei.

"Then let me give you some advice," Gu Mo said.

"Alright."

Chu Feifei nodded. Right now, Gu Mo was her only lifeline.

"Become Senior Sister Yuan's attendant and seek her protection." Gu Mo voiced his thoughts. At this point, Chu Feifei's only option was to find a true backer. Since Gu Mo couldn't fulfill that role yet, Yuan Niya was the only choice.

"Would Senior Sister Yuan agree?" Chu Feifei was worried. Given the circumstances, continuing through the sect's normal promotion channels was no longer feasible.

Becoming Yuan Niya's attendant wasn't something Chu Feifei strongly opposed. After all, this senior sister had a good relationship with Gu Mo, and she trusted that Gu Mo wouldn't harm her.

But would an inner sect disciple like Yuan Niya even consider a mere laborer disciple like her?

"She will, as long as you demonstrate your value." Gu Mo nodded. For Yuan Niya to accept Chu Feifei as her attendant, Chu Feifei would need to prove her worth. Of course, if Gu Mo asked, Yuan Niya would likely agree—but that would make her view Chu Feifei as a burden Gu Mo had foisted upon her.

The truth, however, was that Chu Feifei possessed value significant enough to earn the attention of an inner sect disciple like Yuan Niya.

"Alright."

Chu Feifei nodded. She understood Gu Mo's meaning. At this point, keeping her secrets hidden was no longer realistic. She trusted Gu Mo—if he suggested becoming Yuan Niya's attendant, this was likely the best solution available.

Seeing Chu Feifei's agreement, Gu Mo led her back to Yuan Niya and explained their request.

"Take her as my attendant? And without restricting her freedom?" Yuan Niya studied Chu Feifei, who seemed like an utterly ordinary laborer disciple.

Yuan Niya had never taken on an attendant before—she had always operated independently. Even if she were to take one, she'd prefer someone who could be of real help, like Gu Mo.

Moreover, Gu Mo's condition that Chu Feifei's freedom wouldn't be restricted meant she could leave anytime she wished.

"Senior Sister, come with me."

Gu Mo knew mere words wouldn't convince Yuan Niya to agree to such demanding terms. Now was the time to reveal Chu Feifei's true value.

"Oh? Do you have something good to show me?" Yuan Niya followed Gu Mo into his cottage with curiosity. Knowing Gu Mo, he wasn't the type to make unreasonable demands without offering something in return.

"Exactly!"

Once Yuan Niya and Chu Feifei were inside, Gu Mo closed the door and sealed the windows. His actions made Yuan Niya tense slightly—if she didn't know Gu Mo, she might have thought he was planning something untoward.

Then again, even if Gu Mo did have such intentions, he wouldn't stand a chance against her. And why would he bring Chu Feifei along if that were the case? Unless he was into... group activities.

As Yuan Niya's thoughts wandered, she saw the glow of a perfected Cleansing Technique in Gu Mo's hands. 

"Wait, Junior Brother Gu Mo, the effects of the last Cleansing Technique haven't even—" Yuan Niya began, only to stop mid-sentence as the cleansing light enveloped Chu Feifei instead.

Yuan Niya's eyes widened. She had come to regard Gu Mo's perfected Cleansing Technique as something exclusively hers. Now, he was using it on another female cultivator? A pang of jealousy rose in her heart. Even if it was just a laborer junior sister who posed no threat, it still displeased her.

"Huh?"

Just as her displeasure surfaced, Yuan Niya stared at Chu Feifei in disbelief. Under the perfected Cleansing Technique's glow, Chu Feifei shed her mortal appearance, transforming into a radiant fairy.

Then, an intense, exotic fragrance emanated from Chu Feifei's body. The moment Yuan Niya inhaled the scent, she felt a momentary daze, and her cultivation technique began circulating on its own.

"This... this is—"

Without hesitation, Yuan Niya sat down cross-legged and began circulating her technique. Moments later, she opened her eyes, her gaze brighter than ever before.

The exotic fragrance from Chu Feifei's body could actually aid her cultivation! Yuan Niya possessed a mid-grade fire spiritual root and practiced a fire-attribute technique—one of the top-tier methods capable of reaching the Nascent Soul stage.

However, her technique had one flaw. Yet, the fragrance from Chu Feifei actually suppressed that flaw. How could Yuan Niya not be astonished?
