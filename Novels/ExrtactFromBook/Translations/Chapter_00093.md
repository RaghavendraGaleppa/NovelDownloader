# Chapter 91: Master of the Beast Hall

After finalizing the transaction plan, Han politely bid farewell and followed Wubing out of the Fire Hall.

Wubing continued carrying Han through the city until they arrived at a vast training ground behind the volcano. At the entrance stood a large stone tablet inscribed with the words "Beast Hall."

Numerous demonic beasts leisurely roamed the training ground. Wubing pressed inward until turning into a massive square metal shed, where it finally stopped.

"Master, this is my home. Please rest here. I haven't returned for a long time and need to greet my elder brother," Wubing said before promptly leaving.

Left alone in the large shed, Han began exploring. The shed covered over five acres of land, filled with various items Wubing had collected from Golden Blade Gorge.

Han picked up a golden salted fish propped on a shelf, wielding it like a sword and executing several flourishes. The fish sliced through the air with a sharp, buzzing sound.

This first-grade [Golden Blade Swordfish] forged into a weapon turned out to be unexpectedly effective! The weight was just right, and it conducted spiritual energy exceptionally well—aside from its ugly appearance, it was quite a decent weapon. No wonder many in Iron Devourer City used similar items.

Most of the other items were various first and second-grade rare metals. While valuable in other realms, they were practically littering the ground beneath Golden Blade Gorge.

Han felt Wubing's keen sense of smell was somewhat wasted here—there simply weren't enough living creatures in the gorge for it to be fully utilized.

After circling around without finding anything else of interest, Han found a large metal ingot to sit on and began meditating.

Once he consumed the [Metal-Devouring Honey], it would be time for his second [Lightning Summoning].

Meanwhile, after leaving his residence, Wubing headed straight for the depths of the Beast Hall, entering a massive cave within the volcano.

Inside, a gigantic panda lay before a crystal wall, basking in the heat from the lava visible behind it. The red glow cast flickering light through the transparent barrier.

Wubing approached the enormous panda and announced, "Elder Brother, I've finally met a disciple of the Divine Thunder Palace!"

The panda lowered its head to look at its younger sibling. "What is it? Do you wish to use your treasure?"

"Brother, I have a feeling—this is the one I've been searching for!" Wubing stood only as tall as his brother's paw, and their strength differed vastly.

Wubing's elder brother, Wuyou, was not only the master of the Beast Hall in Iron Devourer City but also a genuine third-grade great demon with formidable bloodline abilities, making him one of the city's core forces.

Wuyou carefully lifted Wubing to his face with one paw and solemnly said, "Little Brother, this treasure belongs to you. If you insist on using it, I won't stop you."

"I'll explain to Elder [Lineage] True Person. Go and invite him here—no, I'll accompany you." As he spoke, Wuyou's massive body abruptly shrank until he was even smaller than Wubing.

The two pandas then departed together.

While Han was meditating, he was greeted by the sight of two pandas—one large, one small. The smaller one exuded an aura surpassing the second grade, making Han acutely aware of the pressure from a great demon's presence.

He hadn't expected Wubing to bring back such a powerful entity! Han quietly circulated his spiritual energy. Though the smaller panda seemed amicable, he was prepared to flee at the first sign of danger.

Wuyou noticed Han's tension and spoke first: "Esteemed disciple of the Divine Thunder Palace, do not be alarmed. I am Wuyou, leader of the Iron Devourer clan and Wubing's elder brother. Our clan shares deep ties with the Divine Thunder Palace—our entire lineage is registered under Elder [Lineage] True Person!"

To Han's surprise, Wuyou then released a unique spiritual message exclusive to the Divine Thunder Palace—this panda actually knew their secret technique, [Minor Thunder Sound Art]!

Lowering his guard slightly, Han replied, "I am Yuanchu, a newly inducted disciple with the lowest cultivation in the sect. I came down the mountain to train. May I ask why the clan leader seeks me?"

Wuyou responded, "Brother Yuanchu, there's no need for haste. Allow me to explain."

"Ten thousand years ago, our Iron Devourer clan produced a great demon saint titled [Flower Tapir], whose power was extraordinary."

"Unlike the demon saints of foreign lands, our ancestor [Flower Tapir] was the life-bound spirit beast of a Divine Thunder Palace Eternal True Person, having grown alongside them as part of the sect."

"However, during a calamity, our ancestor sacrificed himself for the sect and perished, unable to even reincarnate his primordial spirit."

"In recognition of his great service, Elder [Lineage] True Person relocated our entire clan here and built Iron Devourer City!"

"At the time, the elder granted our clan three opportunities to become companion spirit beasts for the sect's true disciples. We still have one remaining."

"Since fate has brought Brother Yuanchu and my younger sibling together, I wonder if you might accept him as your spirit beast? To walk the path of cultivation together and seek immortality!"

Han was taken aback by Wuyou's proposal. He couldn't immediately verify the truth of the story, but more importantly, he had no intention of forming a spirit beast contract so soon.

Though Wubing was a second-grade demonic beast, Han saw no benefit to his cultivation progress—frankly, he wasn't impressed.

However, faced with a great demon, outright refusal wasn't wise. Standing up, Han said, "Clan Leader Wuyou, your proposal concerns my path of cultivation. I must consult my master first. My master, Tianyunzi, has recently assumed leadership of the Divine Thunder Palace and is strict with his disciples. I cannot agree without his approval."

"I shall send him a message immediately—" Mid-sentence, Han took advantage of the pandas' distraction to activate [Earth-Traversing Golden Light Art], vanishing in a flash of light and covering thousands of kilometers in an instant.

He had no intention of further discussion with this third-grade great demon. Regardless of what promises Elder [Lineage] had made, Han wouldn't gamble with his cultivation path!

He planned to wait until advancing further before contracting a truly promising spirit beast—certainly not some clumsy bear as deadweight!

After Han's abrupt departure, Wuyou and Wubing remained unfazed.

Wuyou remarked, "That youth is the sect leader's disciple. To possess such escape arts before even forming his golden core, and as you said, having mastered the [Supreme Cave True Thunder Demon-Slaying Sword], he is indeed a seed of immortality. Your judgment is sound, Little Brother—truly blessed by fortune."

"If you're certain, then proceed."

Wubing nodded and summoned a white lotus from his consciousness, channeling spiritual energy to activate its power.

The legacy treasure of Great Saint [Flower Tapir]—the longevity secret treasure: [Heartlink]!
