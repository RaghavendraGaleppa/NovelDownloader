# Chapter 127: Unleashing Divine Might, Avenging a Blood Feud

At the critical moment, a shout of "Hold it!" came from the distance. A figure leaped into the arena, fists striking out left and right.

Brother Peng immediately executed the "Capturing Leopard Hand," reaching out with both hands to grab the incoming fists, his palms swallowing the punches completely.

The newcomer was none other than Li Xian.

The moment they exchanged blows, Li Xian sensed he was outmatched.

But the arrow was already on the string; he had to let it fly. He tried to retract his hands to execute a follow-up move, but he felt the opponent's wrist strength was terrifyingly strong. His hands were like they were in iron shackles, locked tight by the other.

Left with no choice, he had to clash head-on. His internal Qi churned and surged into his fists. Brother Peng grinned and said, "You trash who can't even circulate Qi through the meridians, dare to compete with me in internal Qi?" He stomped his feet, and an even more potent wave of internal Qi rushed forth.

The two streams of internal Qi wrestled against each other.

The force made their clothes snap and flutter loudly. The surrounding crowd of commoners watched in amazement. While martial artists were a common sight, a battle of this caliber was rarely seen in daily life.

Ordinary people didn't even know what "internal Qi" was.

But even a blind man could tell who was stronger. After just a moment of fighting, Li Xian was drenched in sweat, his face pale, merely holding on with sheer will.

Among the top-tier guards, only Huo Hanying could circulate Qi through the meridians. Li Xian was considered among the best, slightly stronger than Fang Bichun, with denser blood energy and a younger age.

But Brother Peng was superior to him in every aspect.

Brother Peng twisted his waist violently, actually lifting Li Xian into the air. The members of the Leopard Blade Sect cheered, "Brother Peng's skill is amazing, he's actually trained the Leopard Waist Strength to this degree!" "What exquisite Leopard Waist Strength, Brother Peng is almost ready to practice the blade!" "Incredible, incredible! Brother Peng truly deserves the Master's favor!"

Brother Peng was robust and tall. His waist emitted a crackling sound. With every crack, his strength increased by a fraction.

This martial art was truly formidable. It trained the spine to be like a bowstring, utilizing every vertebra to its fullest, channeling strength like an arrow leaving the bow. A fraction of effort yielded tenfold power.

With a whoosh, Brother Peng swung with brute force. How could Li Xian resist? Despite being a seven-foot man, he was flung through the air.

He was hurtling toward a pillar of a tall building. If this hit connected, Li Xian's bones would surely shatter, turning him into a pile of flesh. The sheer horror of it shocked everyone present.

Seeing that the momentum was unstoppable, the crowd closed their eyes. But they didn't hear the sound of flesh and blood splattering. When they looked again, they saw Li Xian standing firmly on the ground, with a handsome youth with a distinct vertical mole between his eyebrows standing beside him.

"Commander Li!"

The guards cheered, then their faces fell. The sight of Commander Pang's injuries was still fresh in their minds. Commander Li was so young; how could he withstand this situation?

Fang Bichun stepped forward and cupped his fists, "Commander Li, it's best to stop the fight. If we continue, we'll have no one left!"

All the guards thought the same.

Li Xian hesitated. No one else had seen what had just happened.

When he was thrown, he thought he was a dead man. Full of sorrow, he suddenly felt a hand press down on his shoulder.

The throwing force vanished instantly, and he landed steadily.

Such martial arts mastery was beyond his comprehension. But the Leopard Blade Sect had deep roots; who knew how many strong fighters they still had.

Brother Peng laughed, "Kid, who are you? I heard them call you their commander?"

Li Xian had intentionally let Li Xian fight first to observe the Leopard Blade Sect's style and determine the appropriate level of force.

Li Xian said, "I am." Upon hearing the word "commander," the Leopard Blade Sect burst into laughter, full of contempt.

Brother Peng's eyes flashed. He stretched his entire body and said, "The last commander couldn't take three moves from Brother Wang. Hehe... This time, I hope you can take three punches from me."

His waist tensed, strength and Qi merged. His muscles and bones were fully stretched. With a stomp of his feet, he charged forward, attacking fiercely.

Li Xian took a step back. The blue brick in front of him exploded, crushed by Brother Peng's stomp. Seeing his attack miss, Brother Peng twisted his body and threw a whip punch.

The martial arts he had learned focused on muscles, bones, and the spine. The damage was immense; one part of strength could be used as ten.

But everything has its pros and cons. Although Brother Peng's strength was fierce, his intent was obvious with every punch.

And his "force line" was too long. The trajectory of every punch started from his feet, flowed through and was amplified by his spine, and finally reached his hands.

In Li Xian's eyes... it was full of flaws.

"Do you only know how to dodge!" Brother Peng missed several times and grew angry. Others couldn't see the difference and secretly sweated for Li Xian.

Li Xian said calmly, "Weak. Too weak." Brother Peng's attacks didn't stop, his eyes wide. "What did you say?"

Brother Peng was about to speak again, but Li Xian's hand shot out. He grabbed Brother Peng by the hair and slammed him into the ground.

The blue bricks shattered. Brother Peng's head was buried deep in the ground, his legs twitching. It was unclear if he had fainted or was already dead.

The crowd was silent, their minds buzzing.

The arrogant, young, and powerful Brother Peng had been easily defeated by someone even stronger and younger.

Li Xian stood in the arena, his expression calm. He exuded an air of composure and extraordinary handsomeness, a presence that seemed to suppress all directions.

"Quick! Go get Brother Liu!"

The Leopard Blade Sect had been overwhelmingly arrogant, spewing all sorts of insults and vulgarities, aiming to humiliate the guards of the One Union Manor completely. But after being so intimidated, no one dared to speak. The atmosphere was heavy. They could only hope that another strong fighter from their sect would come to overshadow Li Xian.

Brother Liu was a second-generation disciple, a powerful fighter capable of practicing the blade.

The Leopard Blade Sect had strict rules and had migrated from elsewhere. To learn the blade... one had to serve the Sect Master for ten years before possibly receiving the true transmission.

"Who dares to be so arrogant here, injuring my Leopard Blade Sect brothers!" A loud shout was heard.

Liu Hong of the Leopard Blade Sect arrived. He carried a large blade on his back, fully prepared.

He was over thirty years old, clearly more composed than the other disciples. He glanced at the situation in the arena and was about to speak some twisted words to show his might before attacking.

But Li Xian charged at him proactively. A simple, unadorned punch was thrown. Liu Hong was extremely arrogant. He snorted, didn't dodge or avoid, and raised his hand to catch it. He chattered incessantly:

"Ignorant child, I, Liu Hong, have cultivated for over a decade. How can you compare to me? Watch as I take you down with one hand!"

As soon as the words fell, he felt as if struck by lightning. A powerful internal Qi rampaged through him like a landslide. The internal Qi he was so proud of was utterly defenseless and was defeated in an instant.

He flew backward, spat three mouthfuls of blood, and fainted.

Simple and brutal, clean and decisive.

"Commander is mighty! Commander is mighty!" The guards' morale surged.

Li Xian frowned, thinking to himself: "The current situation is entirely supported by me alone. If it turns into a group fight, the One Union Manor will surely suffer heavy casualties. If I turn and run, the business in the county will be gone."

An idea came to mind, and he said something to Li Xian. Hearing this, Li Xian stepped back and blended into the crowd.

Li Xian alone held the arena, one man standing guard, ten thousand men unable to break through.

He said, "If anyone else is不服 (unconvinced), bring them all out!" The Leopard Blade Sect was silenced, angry but not daring to speak. They wanted to curse, but seeing the tragic state of Brother Peng and Brother Liu, the words got stuck in their throats.

The heavy atmosphere only turned into cheers when one person arrived.

"Commander Li, this person... is the culprit who injured Commander Pang." Fang Bichun stepped forward, his expression grave.

A young man in a golden leopard outfit arrived at the duel ground.

The crowd gasped in astonishment. A child cried out, "Mom, that's an immortal!"

Some even knelt down and kowtowed.

Li Xian looked straight at him, frowning slightly. The newcomer was showing off, his entire body's blood and energy vibrating, carrying a rainbow on his shoulders. This was the sign of approaching the "Essence Devouring" stage.

Since he came from a sect, his strength was likely even greater than that of Zheng Xuezhang.

The Leopard Spine Strength and Capturing Leopard Hand... these martial arts were enough to reveal that the Leopard Blade Sect was no ordinary force.

"Brother Wang, this kid is also a commander. Please capture him and vent our anger for us!"

"Brother Wang, it's all up to you! This kid has some skill."

Seeing the man arrive, the Leopard Blade Sect's courage swelled.

Wang Bao was twenty-six years old, young and extraordinary. The "Bao" (Leopard) in his name was given by the Sect Master, Xu Liefeng.

He was raised like a son.

Wang Bao was startled when he saw Li Xian's face. Having received the Sect Master's true transmission, he had considerable knowledge. Seeing the red mole on Li Xian's forehead, he suspected it was a "Rebirth Physique," feeling a mix of envy and jealousy.

Wang Bao said, "Your previous commander had his hands cut off by me and his legs shattered. I thought your One Union Manor would stay down for good. I didn't expect you bastards to be so bold as to provoke us主动."

He gripped his blade with both hands, the rainbow on his shoulders like a rainbow.

Li Xian had fought the Jar Immortal and Zheng Xuezhang. Back then, his [Rebirth Physique] hadn't even manifested, yet he wasn't afraid. Now that his strength had improved, there was even less reason to be afraid.

"Then I shall cut off your hands and break your legs," Li Xian said calmly. His hand rested on the hilt of his blade.

Wang Bao sneered, "Good, good. The ignorant are fearless." Though his words were arrogant, he wasn't underestimating his opponent.

As they spoke, the blade pointed downward. He suddenly swept it horizontally, sending the blue stone slabs on the ground flying, all crashing toward Li Xian. Mud splashed, obscuring his vision.

Li Xian wasn't careless. His narrow blade left its sheath. He cut the stone slabs apart, only to see the dust rushing toward him, enveloping him.

Wang Bao hid within the dust cloud.

He darted left and right, his speed agile. Suddenly, a blade light flashed, slashing straight at him. Li Xian parried with his blade, and sparks flew for a moment.

The blade art Wang Bao practiced was called "Golden Leopard Swift Blade." The art aimed for the word "Swift." He had first practiced the "Capturing Leopard Hand" and "Leopard Spine Strength" to lay a foundation.

After switching to the Golden Leopard Swift Blade, he quickly mastered it. The blade art was not only fast but also full of killing intent.

The blade edge was so fast it tore through the air, sounding like a leopard's roar.

And this blade art was extremely flexible. After Wang Bao slashed down, he would immediately pull back, creating distance, not giving Li Xian a chance to counterattack.

He executed this harassment to the extreme.

Li Xian snorted coldly. The "Great Luo Blade Art" was perfected, his skill profound, guarding himself perfectly inside and out. The blade art opened and closed with precision. Wang Bao sneered, "You're quite厉害 (capable), but how can you ever hit me?"

With that, he swept his blade horizontally again, kicking up waves of dust, constantly obscuring the vision.

Li Xian remained calm and composed. He executed the essence of the Great Luo Blade, "Vertical and Horizontal Net." This move aimed to weave a net of blades with vertical and horizontal paths, pushing forward with great power.

The blade paths crisscrossed, truly extremely powerful.

Wang Bao said, "That's all." He was well-versed in blade arts. Observing Li Xian's blade path, it was only one vertical and one horizontal. Although his skill was deep, the blade art was too simplistic, with many flaws.

He seized the gap in the blade art, his figure agile like a leopard, and slashed at Li Xian's wrist.

Li Xian's eyes narrowed. His wrist flipped, and the blade shadows suddenly multiplied, impenetrable.

On the basis of "Vertical and Horizontal Net," he flexibly applied the intent of the [Four Directions Fist].

The martial arts he had learned complemented each other, leading to countless variations. This was something no one else could match!

The blade shadows suddenly increased several-fold. Wang Bao was greatly startled, but he was already enveloped by the blade's momentum.

Light and shadow intertwined, blood flowers splashed.

A scream rang out.

Countless blade strikes came, the extremely fast blade light splitting the dust cloud.

Everyone saw Li Xian's blade art so fast it left afterimages, as if he had sprouted several extra hands. The blade paths were only vertical and horizontal, but they were woven so tightly it was like a wall of blades.

Wang Bao was covered in blade marks, struggling to defend. Injuries accumulated on his body. His clothes were slashed to tatters, and he had hundreds of blade wounds all over.

Li Xian, having mastered his art, was mighty and extraordinary. The entire arena was silent. The Leopard Blade Sect, the guards of the One Union Manor, and even the onlookers were all dumbfounded and filled with terror!
