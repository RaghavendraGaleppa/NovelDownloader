# Chapter 616: Killing You Is Enough

Xu Yunfan moved with lightning speed,毫不犹豫地 refining the trace of Great Yin Immortal Gold Essence wrapped around his fingertips into his body.

This wisp of golden essence originated from the Heavenly Empress of the Upper Realm, containing profound Dao rules.

Because he possessed the Great Yin Profound Mirror Dao Fruit, the golden essence merged seamlessly with the fruit. Having long been prepared, Xu Yunfan encountered no obstacles during the refinement process.

The golden essence was merely a temporary amplification medium, not a necessity.

For Xu Yunfan, consuming this trump card was not particularly regrettable.

This was already a card beneath his true trump cards. Furthermore, the Heavenly Empress had become a banner spirit within the Heavenly Banner; perhaps he could squeeze out another wisp or two from her in the future.

The refined golden essence instantly merged into his meridians, triggering a resonance with the Great Yin Profound Mirror Dao Fruit within the Heavenly Banner. In an instant, Great Yin Power surged around his body.

His aura rose rapidly, crossing the threshold of the late Foundation Establishment realm in an instant and reaching the peak of Foundation Establishment.

The hallmark of the peak Foundation Establishment realm was the condensation of a wisp of Immortal Golden Essence using one's own spirit, energy, and spirit, along with the Dao one cultivated. Once the golden essence accumulated to a certain extent, one's personal manifestation would emerge, allowing one to begin receiving the favor of a Dao Fruit.

Currently, refining the golden essence was a temporary boost, not a true breakthrough.

The golden essence burned like firewood, borrowing the power of the Dao Fruit to exchange for combat prowess capable of rivaling Ye Yuan.

Without the foundation of a Dao Fruit, forcibly refining golden essence would inevitably lead to backlash.

Fortunately, thankfully, the Great Yin Profound Mirror Dao Fruit was in his hands.

The refinement had just concluded when Xu Yunfan felt surging magical power within his body. The Divine Skies magical power around him churned, the sound of its waves like a dragon's roar echoing through the nine heavens, causing the sea of clouds within a ten-mile radius to boil and roll back.

The roar contained the ultimate destruction Dao resonance of Divine Skies Thunder, the sharp edge of the Rage-Killing Sword Intent, and the subtle changes of the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi.

Even Ye Yuan's expression couldn't help but change.

Watching Xu Yunfan squander such a treasure so recklessly, using a wisp of Immortal Golden Essence to achieve a temporary peak Foundation Establishment state, he coldly snorted.

"You haven't even领悟了 a manifestation. What use is increasing your magical power and cultivation to the peak of Foundation Establishment? It's just an empty shell!"

Xu Yunfan's eyes were indifferent.

"Killing you is enough."

As the words fell, Xu Yunfan shook the Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner again.

This banner was the vessel for the "Zhou Tian Star Dou Great Array." He had re-refined it using the methods of the "Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Array," investing half of his family's resources into it. Various natural treasures obtained from Chu Chengnan, and even the Upper Realm, were all used as fuel.

The Ten Thousand Soul Banner was originally a growth-type magic treasure, let alone the Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner derived from it. With so many resources supplied, it naturally ranked among the top magic treasures. If he could use this to ascend to the Golden Core Dao Fruit, ascending to a Spirit Treasure would be a matter of course.

The moment the banner unfurled, a vast starry sky manifested, with three hundred and sixty-five main stars arranged across the firmament.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan formed a hand seal and activated the "Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra."

The immense Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi accumulated for a long time within his Dantian surged out. The eight-colored cloud energy flowed ceaselessly above the Star Banner.

Li Fire was blazing, Kan Water was deep, Gen Mountain was heavy, Zhen Thunder was violent... The Eight Phases Cloud Qi intertwined into a torrent of creation.

The cloud energy entangled the shaft of the Star Spirit Banner, causing the banner body to tremble violently.

Receiving this infusion, the rotation speed of the stellar shadows on the banner surface increased tenfold. The silver-white star arrows transformed into incandescent white pillars of light, their power soaring.

Simultaneously, Xu Yunfan's Divine Sense penetrated the banner's space.

The banner's innate power of enlightenment activated; the banner spirit's consciousness was forcibly commanded to stand upon the Zhou Tian Star positions.

Thus, the starlight of the Zhou Tian Star Dou Great Array completely boiled. The starlight above the East Sea, drawn by this array, bloomed to its utmost extreme.

He no longer had the slightest intention of verbal confrontation, nor did he need to provoke the other party with words.

The peak Foundation Establishment state was fleeting; he needed a swift victory.

Xu Yunfan's hand holding the Star Spirit Banner trembled violently. The three hundred and sixty-five main stars on the banner surface suddenly shone brightly. Boundless starlight poured down like a celestial river from the ninth heaven, carrying the ultimate Yin and cold Gui Water Yin Thunder condensed from the East Sea's Gui Water Essence, transforming into a torrent of destruction that poured down upon Ye Yuan.

The originally calm sea surface below, stimulated by the Divine Skies magical power and thunder, instantly transformed into a boiling thunder marsh. Its pressure was enough to crush a late Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Ye Yuan's long hair danced wildly under the illumination of starlight and thunder. A hint of unsightly color appeared on his cold, iron-hard face.

This person had too many trump cards. Judging by his relaxed and casual demeanor, who knew what else he could pull out.

Whether it was the Zhou Tian Star Dou Array of the Star Spirit Banner or the Rage-Killing Sword Intent, it shook Ye Yuan's heart.

At this moment, Ye Yuan had already萌生ed the intention to retreat.

He glanced at Ye Xuan, who was still hovering in mid-air where Xu Yunfan had tossed her.

He could only plan for her again later.

Ye Yuan took a deep breath, severing the distracting thoughts in his heart.

If he wanted to leave, blindly avoiding the fight would only make him face death sooner. Only by erupting with ultimate power could he fight his way out.

If only he had pursued Lu Chuan or Zhang Qiaoluo instead.

Unbidden, such a thought arose in Ye Yuan's heart.

At least those two wouldn't pull out unexpected trump cards like Xu Yunfan did.

Even though he was suppressed by the array at this moment, Ye Yuan's aura was as deep as an abyss, yet an unprecedented fierce will erupted around him.

"Haah!"

Ye Yuan roared towards the sky, raising the cracked Hui Gang Sword high with both hands.

This life-bound sword weapon, which had accompanied him onto the path of cultivation, nurtured for hundreds of years, and survived countless bloody battles, under the master's burning of his own Dao foundation and will, let out a tragic tremor that exceeded its limits.

His fierce sword intent, which was almost at the limit of peak Foundation Establishment, rose frantically, suddenly unfolding a massive manifestation in the void.

Pure White Domain · Hui Gang Shore!

This was the ultimate manifestation of Ye Yuan's lifelong fierce sword Dao will, his strongest inquiry towards that brilliant sword Dao fruit position.

Within the domain, all colors were stripped away, leaving only pure, extreme light and ferocity.

It seemed as if he, along with the sword in his hand, had transformed into the sole light source in the heavens and earth, carrying all the power of this pure white domain.

The grinding starlight descending from the Star Dou Array was actually momentarily stalled by this manifestation, unable to advance further.

"Slice!!"

The sound Ye Yuan erupted from his mouth was not a sound, but a will-scream like the tearing of the soul.

The Hui Gang Sword fell silently. There was no earth-shattering roar, only a thread of condensed to the extreme, as fine as a hair but seemingly capable of cutting through all things, a white-gold thread.

This was the ultimate mystery of his sword Dao, a desperate killing blow obtained by burning everything, its speed surpassing the limit of Divine Sense capture.

Its target was the core of the array eye, Xu Yunfan. It ignored the layers of starlight barriers and approached in an instant.

At this moment.

A furious howl that pierced straight through the soul exploded within Xu Yunfan's chest.

The calmness in the depths of his eyes was replaced by a madness that could burn the heavens.

The Martial Dao Sky Eye instantly opened to its limit; the vertical pupil shot out golden light like two burning suns.

The Eight Phases Cloud Qi frantically poured into the shaft of the Star Spirit Banner.

The rotation speed of the stellar shadows on the banner surface instantly increased more than tenfold! Simultaneously, his Divine Sense penetrated the banner's space, and the Star Spirit Banner's innate power of enlightenment activated.

"Yang Jian, Nezha, Sun Wukong, Ye Kai, Fei Lun, Sun Yue, Wang Qi... All Star Lords, return to your positions and help me suppress and kill this beast!"

In a flash of dark light, figures with varying auras instantly appeared at the main positions of the Zhou Tian Star Dou.
