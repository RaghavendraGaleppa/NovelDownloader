# Chapter 50: Desperate Flight

Chen Fei was just about to speak and rouse the others when he suddenly saw a ball of red light erupt from Qian Jijiang’s chest. A moment later, a whiff of scorched black smoke rose, and Qian Jijiang shivered in pain.

“Hmm? No, wait, we’ve been here before!”

Qian Jijiang’s eyes cleared, and he looked at their surroundings, especially the distant mountain village, his face turning pale.

“How do we wake them up?” Chen Fei asked. Qian Jijiang truly had some tricks up his sleeve. If not for his Clear Heart Art, Chen Fei would likely be enchanted by the entity and unable to wake himself.

“You’re alright?” Qian Jijiang glanced at Chen Fei in surprise but had no time to question him further. He pulled an incense stick from his bag and lit it. Wisps of blue smoke diffused into the air, and Yan Qing and the other four staggered, their expressions changing drastically as they looked at the distant mountain village again.

“That village is haunted by an entity! Let’s go!” Seeing everyone recover, Qian Jijiang didn’t wait to explain, instead turning and running headlong forward. The others dared not delay and followed him closely.

Chen Fei trailed behind, continuously circulating his Clear Heart Art. The cool sensation gradually calmed him. He watched the approaching mist from all sides, trying to peer further into the distance, the icy feeling slowly spreading into his eyes.

“Everyone, stay close! I’m going to run at full speed!”

With a pained expression, Qian Jijiang took a half-burnt red candle from his bag. This red candle looked no different from those used in ordinary households. Qian Jijiang carefully lit its wick.

A circle of red light expanded, enveloping all of them.

Whether it was an illusion or not, beneath the red glow, the cold that had permeated their bodies moments ago completely dissipated, replaced by a sense of peace that filled their hearts.

At the same time, where the red light shone, the surrounding mist automatically receded, as if intimidated by the candle’s glow.

“Run!” Qian Jijiang shouted, his body shooting forward. The others didn't dare to delay and followed closely behind him.

The group of six all possessed decent movement skills, so even as Qian Jijiang pushed himself to the limit, they managed to keep up.

The mist ahead retreated rapidly, and the small mountain village finally stopped reappearing. Everyone felt a slight loosening in their chests. If they were to see that village again, they might truly go mad.

“No, no, stop! Everyone stop!” Qian Jijiang suddenly yelled, his face terribly pale. Everyone looked at him in confusion, but Chen Fei noticed the red candle in Qian Jijiang’s hand. In just that short while, it had already burned down by more than half.

And even as Chen Fei watched, the red candle was visibly shrinking. At this rate, it would be completely consumed in another quarter of an hour.

Qian Jijiang looked at the red candle, then glanced at the distant village again, gritting his teeth. He pulled another candle from his bag. However, unlike the previous red one, this was a pure white candle.

“This entity is too powerful. We can only gamble now. Otherwise, none of us will leave this place today,” Qian Jijiang said in a low voice.

“What do you need us to do?”

“I’ll light this white candle in a moment and throw it directly behind us. This white candle’s effect is the opposite of the red one; it attracts entities. So, when that happens, everything behind us will become extremely dangerous. Just run as fast as you can.”

Qian Jijiang spoke softly. This was a desperate gamble, a fight for their lives. But if they didn't do this, they would likely keep circling in this place until the red candle burned out, and then everyone would die.

Yan Qing and the others exchanged glances but didn’t stop Qian Jijiang. They had no better plan and could only follow his arrangements.

Qian Jijiang lowered his head and lit the white candle.

An indescribable, strange scent wafted from the white candle. Qian Jijiang put all his strength into it, throwing the white candle backward. The candle flame flickered relentlessly, refusing to be extinguished.
