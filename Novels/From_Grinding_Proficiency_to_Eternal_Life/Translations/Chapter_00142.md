# Chapter 142: Relocating the Sect

Although the Tiangong Cave could not compare to top sects like the Nine Stars Sect, relying on the foundation of Tiangong City, it was far superior to sects like the Green Luan Sword Sect and the Red Crocodile Gang.

“Old Man Mo has already dispatched the Mechanism Hall’s giant bird team to scout. News should be coming back soon.”

At the third quarter of the Yin hour (3:00–4:30 AM), the bells of Tiangong Cave’s nine peaks rang throughout the entire Tiangong Fortress.

When Xu Yunfan followed Zhan Yan into the Assembly Hall, the bronze floor tiles were already covered with corpses draped in white cloths. The surviving stewards of various halls were recording the roster, the sound of pen tips scraping against paper grating to the ear.

“The Tiangong Hall has lost four hundred and seventy-three people, with two hundred severely injured.”

Chu Xu of the Molten Gold Hall leaned on his greatsword, the blade’s edge chipped and cracked, a shocking sight. “The Molten Gold Hall’s earthfire chamber has been destroyed. The head disciple, Yan Yuwei, is severely injured and unconscious.”

Fu Jin stepped through the door carrying a pair of blood-stained armor-breaking hammers.

“The Forging Hall lost sixty-nine disciples. The earthfire chamber needs to be rebuilt.”

“……”

By the time the casualties of the Tiangong Cave disciples and the surviving citizens of the city were tallied, it was already the afternoon of the next day.

Inside the Tiangong Hall, Hong Baichuan, whose face was pale and whose breath was slightly unstable, looked at the various hall masters below, each bearing injuries.

He looked at Mo Han.

Mo Han took a copper tube from his chest. A secret message on sharkskin parchment slid out, illuminated by the fluorescent stones in the hall, revealing shocking words.

“According to the report returned by the Mechanism Hall’s giant kite team, the Green Luan Sword Sect’s mountain gate was burned down, the Sect Master’s head hung on a flagpole. The Red Crocodile Gang’s headquarters sank into the Blue Wave Pool, three hundred disciples drowned. The Iron Bone Gate, Flowing Cloud Manor, Hundred Grass Valley... the seven sects of Cangzhou... are all wiped out!”

With every word Mo Han read, everyone’s expression grew worse.

Silence fell over the hall. Hong Baichuan spoke softly.

“What do you all think?”

Wan Chen’s expression was extremely unsightly.

“The Blue Wave Pool bottom is buried with the previous dynasty’s Sea Suppression Stone. The Red Crocodile Gang’s group of mudfish had this as their backing, able to dive into underwater secret tunnels. How could they...”

“Because the Cangzhou Navy filled the Sea Suppression Stone’s eye with fire thunder.”

Mo Han’s mechanical arm unfurled a scroll brought back by the giant kite team disciples. Three Cangzhou military tower ships were dumping boxes of Thunderfire Shocking Heaven into the bottom of the pool. “Look at the prow patterns; those are the Cangzhou Governor’s personal guard ships!”

Zhan Yan’s face turned extremely dark. As an old fox, he understood perfectly that the Incense Fire Sect’s brazen behavior was backed by the Great Zhou Imperial Court.

“Even the Cangzhou Army has become the Incense Fire Sect’s claws. That witch in Yujing City wants to wipe out the martial arts sects completely!”

The few people present who could become hall masters understood the implications in Mo Han’s words immediately.

Mo Han sneered, “But they can’t wipe them all out. The Great Zhou’s top six sects are high and mighty. They haven’t stepped forward until now. Who knows what secrets are hidden inside.”

Chu Xu, the usually silent master of the Molten Gold Hall, felt as if the sky was collapsing, his figure swaying slightly.

“If that is the case, what should we do?”

“Cangzhou has become a place of trouble. If we at Tiangong Cave stay here, we will eventually provoke the Grandmaster of Qi Refining to make a move.”

The crowd debated heatedly, unable to reach a consensus.

Since its founding, Tiangong Cave has been rooted in Guniu Mountain. Over a thousand years, they naturally developed deep affection for this place.

Wan Chen grumbled, “With the墨家 Mechanism Beast and the Tiangong Steel Lotus Fortress, plus the underground mineral veins and sulfur, we haven’t even mined out five layers yet. Even if a million troops came, they would have to leave empty-handed. What is there to fear!”

“The Mechanism Tiger still has many joints we haven’t figured out. We can’t even exert thirty percent of its power. How do we block it? The reputation of a Grandmaster of Qi Refining wasn’t earned by talking.”

Nine levels of Qi Refining have transcended the mundane, possessing不可思议 (unimaginable) power.

The玄钢 (Mystic Steel) Fortress cannot block it.

For a time, the entire Tiangong Hall was in an uproar, arguing incessantly.

“Relocate the sect!”

Hong Baichuan’s hoarse voice struck like a heavy hammer.

The hall’s dome trembled. The hall masters seemed to have their throats sealed by invisible energy, unable to speak for a long time. In the end, they all sighed in silence.

Half a day later, the messages returned by the giant kite team disciples were all chillingly bad news.

Beside him, Mo Han seemed to have prepared beforehand. He took a paper tube from a mechanism next to the Tiangong Hall and spread the diagrams inside onto the table in front of everyone.

“Over the past few decades, I’ve traveled all over, so I naturally know many unique places suitable for our Tiangong Cave. Back then, I tried to deduce and select locations. We need to satisfy three conditions: a high-quality iron mineral vein a hundred zhang underground, naturally abundant associated rare minerals, a magma earthfire within thirty li, and no王朝 (dynasty) garrison within a hundred li. There aren’t many, but there are three places.”

His mechanical finger traced over the diagram and pointed to a spot on the map.

“The border between Monan Dao and Jiannan Dao. The earthfire burns year-round. One of the previous dynasty’s墨家 inheritors, the Giant Stream, built a Li Fire Earth Palace here. Although it is buried, the core furnace is still operational. We might be able to replicate this furnace and move it to the Mechanism Beast as a power source.”

“Second, the border between Great Zhou and the Western Regions. Under the sandstorms lies ancient meteoric iron. Three years ago, a caravan dug up the remains of a墨家 Mechanism Scorpion here, proving the existence of a large mineral vein underground, and there is a natural magma fountain. It is not inferior to the Thunderfire Cave under Guniu Mountain.”

“Third, a treacherous place in Lingnan Dao. Twenty years ago, when the earth dragon flipped, I went there personally and saw a bronze giant gate emerging from the magma lake. It was left by墨家 Mechanism Art. Back then, Chu Xu went with me. He measured it, and there is an astonishingly rich mineral vein underground.”

Zhan Yan frowned tightly. “The Li Fire Earth Palace is only eight hundred li from Yujing. There is a post road passing through. If the Great Zhou witch’s Black Armor Guards set out at dawn, they will arrive by dusk! How do we defend during the settling-in period?”

Chu Xu looked at the Xuanyuan Desert, his brows furrowed into a character for ‘ten’ (cross).

“The meteoric iron in the Xuanyuan Desert contains celestial dark energy. Ordinary furnaces cannot handle it. The Molten Gold Hall disciples might be harmed by the dark energy!”

“You...”

Seeing that the crowd was arguing again, Hong Baichuan coughed lightly.

“Half a month later... *cough*... we will make a decision. Hall Master Mo, Hall Master Wan, Hall Master Chu, I will trouble you to prepare all materials with all your might during this time.”

He looked at Zhan Yan. “During this time, I’m afraid we need to prepare more weapons and crossbow bolts.”

Zhan Yan replied, “With the molds from the Mechanism Hall, we have enough crossbow bolts to go around.”

Three days had passed since the meeting in the Tiangong Hall.

Three hundred zhang underground in Guniu Mountain, Xu Yunfan looked at Yan Yuwei, who was wrapped in bandages, and asked hesitantly, “Are you really okay?”

“Who are you looking down on?”

Yan Yuwei waved her hand, the mechanism iron ore pick in her hand swinging, making a *chi chi* sound of breaking wind.

“When this old lady practiced the Molten Gold Forging Iron Art back then, to absorb the metal energy from the mineral veins, I was injured worse than this. The next day, I still came to dig ore and practice martial arts.”

Xu Yunfan didn’t say anything more. Two days ago, he had proposed to Zhan Yan that he wanted to learn the martial arts of the other three halls of the Tiangong Department concurrently. Zhan Yan naturally refused.

But when Xu Yunfan revealed his state of Three Training Perfection, Zhan Yan opened his mouth wide and agreed in a daze.

(I should have another chapter later, currently typing.)
